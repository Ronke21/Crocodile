<text>Flight 16P of SpaceShipOne was a spaceflight in the Tier One program that took place on September 29, 2004. It was the first competitive flight in the Ansari X PRIZE competition to demonstrate a non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft, and is hence also referred to as the X1 flight. A serious roll excursion occurred during boost, so the flight did not achieve the expected altitude. However, it exceeded 100 km altitude, making it a successful X PRIZE flight.

==Scheduling==

X PRIZE rules required that the date and place of competitive flights be announced to the X PRIZE Foundation at least 60 days before the flight. Due to problems encountered during flight 15P on June 21, 2004, Scaled Composites did not immediately set a date for their competitive flights, suspecting that another test flight might be required. By July 7, 2004 Burt Rutan reported that the faults had been resolved and the next flights would be competitive. On July 27, 2004, the X PRIZE Foundation announced that Scaled Composites had given notice that they would make their first competitive flight on September 29, 2004.

The pilot initially selected for the flight withdrew due to stress about two weeks before the flight, after his wife gave birth and he also fell ill. Mike Melvill, who also piloted SpaceShipOne&#x27;s sole previous spaceflight, stepped in to fly in his place. The choice of pilot was not publicly announced until about two hours before planned takeoff. Melvill was seen as a surprise choice, because after the previous flight he had said he wanted to take a break from flying SpaceShipOne and ride his motorbike more.

==Manifest==

Under Ansari X PRIZE rules, the flight was required to carry 180 kg payload, to simulate two 90 kg human passengers. Scaled Composites announced early on that this, their first X PRIZE flight, would carry inanimate payload rather than live passengers. The payload included:
*X PRIZE flight monitoring equipment, known as the &quot;gold box&quot;
*the Explorers Club flag, by arrangement between the Explorers Club and the X PRIZE Foundation
*video equipment, producing a video stream that was broadcast live
*mementos from team members, including:
**photographs
**personal tools, including Burt Rutan&#x27;s college slide rule
**tree seedlings
**the ashes of Burt Rutan&#x27;s mother, Irene Rutan, who had died a few years earlier
**an heirloom watch
**a copy of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s book The Spirit of St. Louis
*a teddy bear being carried for the British charity Great North Air Ambulance
*lead ballast to make up the payload mass

The practice of carrying arbitrary non-functional items into space, which has previously been carried out by many Space Shuttle missions, is evidence that space travel is still widely seen as special. The value of symbolic items increases enormously if the item has flown in space, due to the restricted access to space. The teddy bear being carried for charity will be auctioned at a much higher price than it would otherwise command. Scaled Composites employees were made to sign a contract forbidding them from selling the mementos they put on the flight.

SpaceShipOne and White Knight bore several logos for the flight. These were:
*Scaled Composites
*&quot;SpaceShipOne: a Paul G. Allen project&quot; on SpaceShipOne
*&quot;White Knight&quot; on White Knight
*Virgin Galactic, on the tails, following the signing earlier in the week of an agreement for Virgin Galactic to license Tier One technology for space tourism
*Virgin, on the fuselage
*Ansari X PRIZE, as required by X PRIZE rules
*The Spirit of St. Louis, a science center
*M&amp;M&#x27;s, apparently in an act of sponsorship inspired by Melvill&#x27;s antics with M&amp;M&#x27;s during flight 15P
*7-Up Plus
*Champ Car World Series

==Crew==
==Flight profile==

The SpaceShipOne pilot was Mike Melvill. There were three chase planes.

All times are in PDT, which is seven hours behind UTC. This was the local civil time at the spaceport on the day of the flight. All measurements are first stated in the U.S. customary units in which they were originally reported, with conversions to SI units also given.

The flight was planned to take off from Mojave Spaceport in the early morning, when wind conditions are most favourable. Takeoff was scheduled for 06:47, but was delayed because of winds gusting to 50 mph (20 m/s), which subsided after sunrise. White Knight, carrying SpaceShipOne, taxied to the runway at 07:00, and took off at 07:11.

After takeoff, White Knight and SpaceShipOne ascended to the launch altitude, planned to be around 14 km. At 08:09 SpaceShipOne was released, glided for 6 s, then went into nose-up attitude and the rocket motor was ignited. The rocket motor was capable of burning for approximately 87 s, having been upgraded since the previous flight. It was planned to shut off the motor at an altitude of 345,000 feet (105 km), presumably to avoid pushing the envelope too far.

The spacecraft started rolling rapidly 50 s into the burn, while travelling at Mach 2.7. This was probably due to, or at least exacerbated by, pilot error. The pilot was not highly concerned by this, being confident that he could correct the situation, and he allowed the burn to continue during the roll. He later said &quot;I thought it was kind of cool.&quot; The altitude was too high (and thus the atmosphere too thin) for the roll to cause significant aerodynamic stress, and it was correspondingly infeasible to damp the roll rate using the aerodynamic control surfaces.

When there was sufficient velocity to assure the achievement of the target altitude, as predicted by the navigational system, the ground controllers recommended that the pilot abort the burn. He promptly did so, 76 s into the burn, cutting it short by 11 s. After engine cutoff, the craft continued climbing while rolling. The pilot did not immediately work to damp the roll. Around apogee he took photographs of the Earth using a digital still camera.

The apogee altitude was estimated by the nearby Edwards Air Force Base, based on radar data, to be 337,569 feet (102.9 km). Due to the early burn cutoff, this was far less than originally anticipated. However, it was more than the 100 km necessary to qualify as a spaceflight and satisfy X PRIZE requirements. Early reports said that after the instruction from the ground the pilot had delayed the burn cutoff in order to exceed 100 km; in fact the instruction was issued just after the 100 km altitude was assured, and the pilot&#x27;s reaction time accounts for the additional 2.9 km.

After apogee, the pilot feathered the wing for atmospheric reentry. He then damped out the roll, without difficulty, using the reaction jets. Overall, the craft did 29 complete rolls. Atmospheric reentry proceeded normally, with the craft rapidly righting its attitude due to the stable high-drag configuration. It changed back to gliding configuration normally, glided back to the spaceport, and landed safely at 08:34. White Knight then landed at 08:39.

==Spectacle==

As with SpaceShipOne&#x27;s previous flight, a crowd of thousands watched from Mojave Spaceport. Television coverage also occurred. SPACE.com provided live video from SpaceShipOne&#x27;s cockpit.

Distinguished attendees included:
*Sean O&#x27;Keefe, NASA Administrator
*Erik Lindbergh, grandson of the pioneering aviator Charles Lindbergh and a member of the X PRIZE Foundation board
*James Cameron, action film director
*John Landis, film director
*William Readdy, astronaut

At 06:09, shortly before planned takeoff, spectators were told to stay at the spaceport after the flight, to hear a &quot;major announcement&quot; about the future of the X PRIZE Foundation. As of October 4, 2004, it appears that no such announcement was actually made.

Spectator reaction was more muted than for SpaceShipOne flight 15P, the first SpaceShipOne flight to have spectators, which was also the first privately funded human spaceflight.

==Later flights==

To win the X PRIZE, a spacecraft must make two successful competitive flights within 14 days. With this flight on September 29, 2004, successful, a second spaceflight had to follow by October 13, 2004, in order to win.

Scaled Composites scheduled the second competitive flight, flight 17P, for October 4, 2004, the 47th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, and it was completed successfully on schedule. There was a possibility of a third competitive flight (18P) occurring by October 13, 2004, if either of the first two flights failed, but in the end this was not required.

The da Vinci Project, another X PRIZE contender, planned to make its first competitive flight on October 2, 2004, but encountered problems and had to delay its flights.

<doc id="838523" wikidata="Q4212817" url="?curid=838523" title="Kapa">
<text>Kapa is a fabric made by native Hawaiians from the bast fibres of certain species of trees and shrubs in the orders Rosales and Malvales. The bark is beaten and felted to achieve a soft texture and dye stamped in geometric patterns.

==Description and uses==

Similar to &quot;tapa&quot; found elsewhere in Polynesia (the Hawaiian phoneme corresponds to in most other Polynesian languages), kapa differs in the methods used in its creation. Kapa is based primarily on the creative combination of linear elements that cross and converge to form squares, triangles, chevrons, and diagonal forms, giving a feeling of boldness and directness. Kapa was used primarily for clothing like the &quot;malo&quot; worn by men as a loincloth and the &quot;pāū&quot; worn by women as a wraparound. Kapa was also used for , a shawl or cape worn over one shoulder. Other uses for kapa depended on caste and a person&#x27;s place in ancient Hawaiian society.

&quot;&quot; (bed covers) were reserved for the &quot;alii&quot; or chiefly caste—several layers of kapa would be stitched together at the edges to form a kapa moe. Kapa robes were used by &quot;kāhuna&quot; or priestly caste. Kapa was also used as banners where leis were hung from it and images of their gods were printed on it.

==Techniques==
Cultural anthropologists over the course of the 20th century identified techniques in the creation of kapa that are unique to the Hawaiian Islands. &quot;Wauke&quot; (&quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;) was the preferred source of bast fibres for kapa, but it was also made from &quot;ulu&quot; (&quot;Artocarpus altilis&quot;), &quot;ōpuhe&quot; (&quot;Urera&quot; spp.), &quot;maaloa&quot; (&quot;Neraudia melastomifolia&quot;), &quot;māmaki&quot; (&quot;Pipturus albidus&quot;), &quot;ākala&quot; (&quot;Rubus hawaiensis&quot;), &quot;ākalakala&quot; (&quot;R. macraei&quot;), and &quot;hau&quot; (&quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;). In the 18th century, pieces of kapa were often made of grooving or ribbing. It is done by pushing the dampened cloth into the grooves of a special board. The &quot;wauke&quot; tree is cut and soaked in water. It is then laid on a &quot;kua kūkū&quot; (polished stone tablet) and beaten with a &quot;hōhoa&quot; (rounded beater). After the first phase of beating, the kapa is transferred to a sacred house to be beaten a second time, but in a religious manner.

==Process==
Each kapa manufacturer used an &quot;ie kūkū&quot;, a beater with four flat sides that were each carved differently. Another way to carve the kapa is by starting on the four-sided affairs, with the coarsest grooves on one side used first in breaking down the bast, or wet bark. Then, the beating continued using two sides with finer grooves. Lastly, finishing touches were accomplished with the remaining smooth side of the beater. The carvings left an impression in the cloth that was hers alone. After the European discovery of the Hawaiian Islands, Western traders travelled to Hawaii especially for kapa.

The process of making kapa was done primarily by women. Young girls would learn by helping their mothers, over time doing the majority of the work, and when older could make kapa by themselves.

<text>Tapa is a town in Tapa Parish, Lääne-Viru County, Estonia, located at the junction of the country&#x27;s Tallinn–Narva (west–east) and Tallinn–Tartu–Valga (north–south) railway lines. Tapa has the Estonian Defense Forces nearby Keskpolügoon. The Valgejõgi River passes Tapa on its northeastern side. Tapa has been known as both a railway and a military town throughout its history.

Tapa developed as a village in the 13th–14th centuries. It was first mentioned in 1482 and the Tapa knight manor () in 1629. Tapa was officially recognized as a town in 1926. In October 2005, the town merged with the municipalities of Lehtse Parish, Saksi Parish, and Jäneda Parish to form Tapa Parish.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of Tapa is uncertain. The name of the town may come from the older form of the personal name &quot;Tabbe&quot;. Alternately, it may be derived from the Estonian words &quot;tapu&quot; (a cruciferous plant) or &quot;tappo&quot; (arable land surrounded by a fence), or from the Karelian word &quot;tapos&quot; (place of residence).

However, in Estonian, &quot;tapa&quot; is an imperative form of the verb &quot;tapma&quot; &#x27;kill&#x27;, resulting in a purported etymology from the Estonian word &#x27;to kill&#x27;. This is considered folk etymology, which led to an urban legend that during Soviet times the town had a newspaper called &quot;Tapa Kommunist&quot;, which could mean either &#x27;Communist of Tapa&#x27; or &#x27;Kill a Communist&#x27;. Later, the name was according to legend changed to &quot;Tapa Edasi,&quot; in Estonian &#x27;Keep Killing&#x27;. Both are in fact false; in reality, the local party newspaper was called &quot;Edasi Kommunismile&quot; (Forward to Communism). 

==Railway==
The Baltic Railway Company opened the tracks on 24 October 1870. Construction of the Tapa–Tartu branch of the railway began in 1875, and the first train to Tartu passed through Tapa on 21 August 1876. The repair shop opened in 1876.

The three long, white rectangles on Tapa&#x27;s flag represent the three branches of the railway that meet there.

==Military bases==

On 1 August 1923, an armoured train regiment () was formed in Tapa with two armoured wagons: the &quot;Kapten Irv&quot;, which served in the Estonian War of Independence, and the &quot;Onu Tom&quot;. On 30 November 1934, a regiment in Valga (in southern Estonia) was moved to Tapa. In January 1941, the regiment was dissolved by Soviet forces. On 14 August 1941, Nazi German troops took over Tapa. The Germans housed their military items here, where the Estonian armoured train regiment&#x27;s headquarters had been. In 1972, the engineering-technical education military unit no. 67665 of the Soviet army was on the site.

There has been an airfield on the southern edge of Tapa since 1932. The Tapa Aerial Union () held its first fly-in on 30 September 1934. The Russians began building a military airfield on the site in the fall of 1939. The Soviets began extensive construction of a military airfield in the spring of 1952. MiG-17s were stationed at the base by the end of the same year. Later, Tapa Airfield was made home to the Soviet 656th Interceptor Aviation Regiment. In 1993, the Estonian Defence Ministry assumed control of the airfield. On 18 June 1993, the first civilian plane touched down on the cement runway.

The phrase &quot;the burning water of Tapa&quot; () refers to the fact that so much fuel from Soviet MiG-23 fighters leaked into Tapa&#x27;s groundwater that one could actually set a glass of tap water on fire, something that can be based on fact as Soviet aviation fuel, like most aviation fuels, had a lower density than water and could have floated on top.
As the Soviet troops and their families left Tapa, the town&#x27;s population dropped from 10,395 in 1989 to 6,800 in 2000. In January 2002, following changes in the structure of Estonian defence units, Tapa became the home of a military base. The Northeast Defence District () in Tapa includes an army training center, an artillery battalion, an anti-aircraft battalion and an engineer battalion. The base is also home to a British-led eFP battlegroup as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade.On the north wall of Tapa&#x27;s railway station, there is a bronze plaque, originally dedicated on 9 January 1934 and rededicated on 20 February 1993, that commemorates the Estonian War of Independence. On the plaque is the symbol of Tapa&#x27;s armoured train regiment. Called &quot;Flying Death on the Railway&quot;, the symbol is a skull with a pair of angel wings and wagon train wheels behind it.

==Religion and culture==

At services on 2 December 2007, the first Sunday of Advent, the congregation of the St. Jacob&#x27;s Lutheran Church, celebrated its 75th anniversary. A temporary house of prayer was dedicated in Tapa on 19 June 1921 by the first bishop of the EELK, Jaak Kukk. It was named after the apostle John. St. Jacob&#x27;s was dedicated on 27 November 1932, the first Sunday of Advent. Either August Tauk or Anatoli Podchekayev is the architect of the neo-historical stone church. The altarpiece, called the &quot;Joyous Christ&quot; or &quot;Come to me&quot;, was painted by Russian icon artist Olga Obolyaninova. The church was renovated from 1953–55 and from 1972–74.

On 10 June 2007, the Baptist church in Tapa celebrated its 75th anniversary. The church was established on 12 June 1932, and Philip Gildemann was its first pastor. In 1940, services moved to Tapa&#x27;s Methodist church building. In 1980, it acquired the building at Kooli Street 1 for Sunday school and other youth programs. In November 2003, it changed its name to the Tapa Living Faith Church (). It holds Sunday services, with simultaneous translation into Russian, in Tapa&#x27;s Methodist church at Kesk Street 11.

On 30 May 1908, individuals from Tallinn and Tartu met in Tapa to agree on how the Estonian language should be written. The Estonian Literary Society in Tartu and the Literature Department of the Folk Education Society of Estonia in Tallinn convened a conference. The first of four conferences that were held from 1908 to 1911 was in Tapa. The meeting took place in the &quot;Harmonie&quot; room of what is today Tapa&#x27;s music school. On 30 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of this conference, Tapa organized another conference on the Estonian language. The theme of the conference was &quot;Language Grows from Me&quot;.

Before the conference began, a plaque to commemorate the very first conference was unveiled in front of the music school by Kuno Rooba, Tapa&#x27;s mayor. The plaque reads &quot;Tapal toimus esimene eesti kirjakeele konverents&quot; (&#x27;The first conference on written Estonian took place in Tapa&#x27;).

==In popular culture==

<doc id="838532" wikidata="Q1700281" url="?curid=838532" title="John Greig">
<text>John Greig (born 11 September 1942) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a defender. He spent his entire career with Rangers, as a player, manager and director. Greig was voted &quot;The Greatest Ever Ranger&quot; in 1999 by the club&#x27;s supporters, and has been elected to Rangers&#x27; Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Greig played his youth football with United Crossroads Boys Club in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Eric Gardiner, and supported Hearts as a boy. It is unknown if Hearts showed any interest in signing him. Bob McAuley signed Greig for Rangers and despite his initial reluctance, Greig did as instructed by his father. However, after viewing a match between Rangers and Hibernian at Easter Road, where he witnessed them beating Hibs 6–1, he was convinced the move was right.

==Playing career ==
=== Club ===
A determined, forceful player, recognised for his great leadership qualities, Greig made 755 official appearances for Rangers (498 in the domestic league, 72 in the Scottish Cup, a club record 121 in the League Cup and 64 in European tournaments). He scored 120 goals for the club and won three domestic trebles. Greig actually started his career with Rangers as a forward, prior to being moved back to midfield — playing initially alongside another Rangers legend in Jim Baxter — and finally to left back. It was therefore in those initial years that he scored the majority of his goals for the club.

Greig was captain when Rangers won the European Cup Winners Cup in 1972 beating Dynamo Moscow 3–2 in Barcelona. Although Greig&#x27;s was an enormously successful playing career, his captaincy coincided with a period of sustained success for Rangers&#x27; city rivals, Celtic, from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s. Greig&#x27;s fortitude during that period further cemented his reputation as one of Rangers&#x27; most celebrated captains.

He was granted a testimonial match in 1978 against a Scotland XI as part of the national squad&#x27;s preparations for the 1978 FIFA World Cup; Rangers won 5–0 before a crowd of 65,000 at Ibrox.

=== International ===
Greig played for Scotland on 44 occasions, 15 as captain, between 1964 and 1975. He scored the late winner in Scotland&#x27;s 1–0 victory against Italy at Hampden Park on 9 November 1965 and in 1967 achieved the distinction of captaining the Scottish side who beat England 3–2 — their first defeat as World Champions — at Wembley. Greig also represented the Scottish League XI 14 times.

== Managerial career ==
Greig&#x27;s playing career ended in May 1978 when he was appointed manager of Rangers, replacing Jock Wallace. The club failed to win the league championship during Greig&#x27;s time as manager, finishing no higher than the second place achieved in 1978–79. Greig&#x27;s team had come close to winning a domestic treble and performed well in Europe in that first season. Rangers reached the quarter-final of the 1978–79 European Cup, defeating Italian champions Juventus and becoming the first club to win in European club competition at PSV&#x27;s Philips Stadion, before eventual elimination to Cologne. There was also the partial compensation of success in domestic cup competitions, with two Scottish Cups and two League Cups secured over the course of Greig&#x27;s five full seasons as manager. Greig was also responsible for signing Rangers&#x27; greatest ever goalscorer Ally McCoist from Sunderland. However, these were isolated achievements, and Greig — under intense pressure from the Scottish media, Rangers supporters and the club&#x27;s directors — resigned in October 1983, replaced by the returning Wallace.

== Post-football career ==
After leaving Rangers, Greig worked as a pundit for Radio Scotland and BBC television. He returned in 1990 as part of the club&#x27;s public relations team. Dick Advocaat, manager of Rangers from 1998 to 2001, re-involved Greig in football coaching during which time he contributed to youth development. In 2003, he joined the Rangers board of directors. Greig resigned this position in October 2011, soon after the takeover of the club by Craig Whyte. Greig and John McClelland, who resigned at the same time as Greig, stated that they had been excluded from the corporate governance of the club since Whyte had taken control. Greig later re-joined Rangers on 23 May 2015, when he was named the club&#x27;s honorary life president with ambassadorial responsibilities.

== Honours ==

Greig was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) on 15 November 1977. In June 2008, he was awarded honoris causa, from the University of Glasgow in recognition for outstanding achievement in football and continuing ambassadorship for the sport.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to association football and the community in Scotland.

<doc id="838538" wikidata="Q526198" url="?curid=838538" title="Thérèse Casgrain">
<text>Marie Thérèse Casgrain (; 10 July 1896 – 3 November 1981) was a French-Canadian feminist, reformer, politician and senator. She was a leader in the fight for women&#x27;s right to vote in the province of Quebec, as well as the first woman to lead a political party in Canada. In her later life she opposed nuclear weapons and was a consumer activist. A strong federalist, one of her last political actions, at age 83, was to intervene on the &quot;No&quot; side in the 1980 Quebec sovereignty referendum.

==Family and early life==

Born in Saint-Irénée-les-Bains, near Quebec City, Thérèse was raised in a wealthy family, the daughter of Blanche, Lady Forget (née MacDonald), and Sir Rodolphe Forget, a wealthy entrepreneur and Conservative Member of Parliament.

In 1905, at eight years old, she became a boarder at the Dames du Sacré-Coeur, at Sault-au-Récollet, near Montreal. Upon graduation, she hoped to further her studies at university, but her father opposed the idea, not seeing any utility in further education for women. In his view, Thérèse should instead learn how to manage a household, a skill that would befit a future wife of her stature.

Thérèse was engaged twice. Her first fiancé died falling out of a window while sleepwalking, when she was only seventeen years old. In 1916, aged twenty, she married Pierre-François Casgrain, a wealthy Liberal politician with whom she raised four children.

Thérèse&#x27;s father, Sir Rodolphe, had represented the Charlevoix riding since the general election of 1904, holding it as a Conservative. However, he was opposed to conscription and with the Conscription Crisis looming, he decided that he would not stand for re-election in the general election of 1917. Her husband, Pierre Casgrain, sought the nomination in the new Charlevoix—Montmorency riding for the Liberal Party as a Laurier Liberal, opposed to conscription. He was elected in the general election.

== Women&#x27;s right to vote ==

Thérèse Casgrain accompanied her husband to Ottawa, the national capital, for the opening of the parliamentary session in the spring of 1918. It was during her time in Ottawa that she became aware of the importance of the right to vote for women. Prior to the 1917 Canadian federal election, women did not have the right to vote in federal elections. In the lead-up to the election, the government of Prime Minister Borden had enacted the &quot;Wartime Elections Act&quot;, which gave the right to vote to wives, widows, mothers, and sisters of soldiers serving overseas. Although this was a clear attempt to gain votes in favour of the war effort, it was a significant milestone for women&#x27;s suffrage in Canada. The Borden government would later adopt the &quot;Women&#x27;s Suffrage Act&quot;, which gave the right to vote at federal elections to all Canadian women aged twenty-one years or older, from 1919 onwards.
In spite of these changes at the federal level, and the expansion of women&#x27;s suffrage in most other provinces, women in Quebec still could not vote during provincial elections. The opposition for such an extension of the law was strong, notably from the clergy and the conservative elite.

Casgrain led the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Quebec for twenty years. Her tenacity, her political contacts through her husband (who eventually became Speaker of the House of Commons), her leadership and her ability to inspire, all helped her to achieve her goal of women&#x27;s right to vote in Quebec. She founded the Provincial Franchise Committee in 1921 and campaigned for women&#x27;s rights, writing innumerable letters to influential people, making annual trips to the provincial capital at Quebec City, and broadcasts on radio, speaking for women&#x27;s rights. From 1928 to 1942, she was the leader of the League for Women&#x27;s Rights. She founded her own radio show in the 1930s, &quot;Fémina&quot;. Finally in 1938, she succeeded in having women&#x27;s right to vote added to the platform of the Liberal Party of Quebec. The right was not won until 1940.

== Electoral politics ==
In late 1941, Casgrain&#x27;s husband was appointed to the Superior Court of Quebec. She sought the nomination of the Liberal Party to stand for election in the vacant riding of Charlevoix—Saguenay, the same riding which had been held by her father and then her husband, but the party turned her down. In the resulting federal by-election, she stood as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; candidate in the riding, but was not successful.

Following World War II, she left the Liberal Party and joined the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). In 1948, she became one of the federal vice presidents of the CCF. She led the Quebec wing of the party, the Parti social démocratique du Québec, from 1951 to 1957. She was, therefore, the first female leader of a political party in Canada. In the 1960s, she was president of the Quebec wing of the New Democratic Party, the CCF&#x27;s successor.

Casgrain was a CCF candidate in a 1952 federal by-election and in the 1953, 1957, and 1958 federal general elections and a New Democratic Party candidate in the 1962 and 1963 federal general elections. She also used her position as a platform to campaign against the government of Maurice Duplessis.

== Activism ==

In 1945, Casgrain was successful in ensuring that women in Quebec could receive family allowance cheques in their own name. Prior to that time, and only in Quebec, family allowance cheques were only made out to the father. She also agitated for equal treatment of married women in the Quebec justice system.

In the 1960s, she became a campaigner against nuclear weapons, founding in February 1961 the Quebec wing of Voice of Women (VOW) and serving as the national president of VOW from 1962 to 1963. She also was a founder of the &quot;La Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot;, which in 1978 became the Ligue des droits et libertés, and the &quot;Fédération des femmes du Québec&quot;.

In 1969, Casgrain was elected president of the Consumers&#x27; Association of Canada Quebec section. Casgrain succeeded to an anglophone president, David Macfarlane, who considered that the Quebec section&#x27;s position was indefensible, as it was dominated by anglophone elements and used English as its primary work language. Many members of the association hoped Casgrain would fix this problem as president.

== Senator and later life ==

Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Casgrain to the Senate of Canada in 1970, where she sat as an independent for nine months before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. As senator she questioned the prime minister&#x27;s policy on the use of Canadian-made napalm and defoliants in Vietnam.

In 1972, she published her autobiography, &quot;A Woman in a Man&#x27;s World&quot;.

For the last decade of her life, she was committed to helping the rights of Indigenous women. She also involved herself in charity works and consumer rights.

In spite of her inherited wealth, by the end of her life she was financially dependent on her daughters.

== 1980 Quebec sovereignty referendum ==
During the 1980 Quebec sovereignty referendum, Casgrain campaigned for the &quot;No&quot; side. She was among the voices who criticized Lise Payette, then provincial minister for the status of women, for saying that women who didn&#x27;t back a &quot;Yes&quot; vote would be responsible for blocking progress. Payette likened them to Yvette, a fictional schoolgirl who featured in school primers.

== Death ==
Thérèse Casgrain died in 1981, living with one of her daughters in Montreal. She is interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal.

== Assessment ==

It was during her period as a candidate with the CCF and the Parti social démocratique du Québec, that Casgrain acquired the reputation of a &quot;pearl-necklace leftist.&quot; Always impeccably dressed and coiffed, with elegant hats, she would make speeches to workers, encouraging them to make their demands known to their employers in companies and mines - companies of which she was often a share-holder, with shares inherited from her businessman father.

Those who knew her said that she was not one to consult with others or to follow the rules, and could be exhausting to work with. However, she always seemed to know who to call on the telephone to obtain the goal she was working towards. She was known above all for her tenacity in working for women&#x27;s causes. By the end of her life she was well-known, respected, but sadly alone in solitude.

<doc id="838541" wikidata="Q7754423" url="?curid=838541" title="The Notebook of Trigorin">
<text>The Notebook of Trigorin is a play by American playwright Tennessee Williams, adapted from Anton Chekhov&#x27;s drama &quot;The Seagull&quot; (1895). Williams based his adaptation primarily on Ann Dunnigan&#x27;s 1960 translation.

The play was first produced in 1981 by the Vancouver Playhouse in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1980, Williams&#x27; play &quot;The Red Devil Battery Sign&quot; had been given a new production at the Playhouse by artistic director Roger Hodgman while Williams was Writer in Residence at the University of British Columbia. Invited to return with a new play, Williams confessed his desire to adapt Chekov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;. The October 1981 production was confirmed before a single page of the adaptation was written.

<text>Robert Methven Petrie (May 15, 1906 – April 8, 1966) was a Canadian astronomer.

He was born in Scotland but emigrated to Canada at the age of five. He grew up in Victoria, British Columbia and studied physics and mathematics at the University of British Columbia. He began working summer jobs at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and became fascinated with astronomy.

He obtained his PhD at the University of Michigan in 1932. He taught there until 1935, when he joined the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. In 1951 he became its director.

He extensively studied spectroscopic binaries.

The crater Petrie on the Moon is named after him. The Canadian Astronomical Society established the R. M. Petrie Prize Lecture to honor his astrophysical research.

<doc id="838560" wikidata="Q3234798" url="?curid=838560" title="The Life and Loves of a She-Devil">
<text>The Life and Loves of a She-Devil is a 1983 novel by British feminist author Fay Weldon. A story about a highly unattractive woman who goes to great lengths to take revenge on her husband and his attractive lover, Weldon stated that the book is about envy, rather than revenge.

The novel was adapted into a BBC television serial in 1986 and an American comedy film, &quot;She Devil&quot;, in 1989. 

==Plot==
Ruth is an abnormally tall and ugly housewife whose husband, Bobbo, considers their relationship an open marriage based on convenience alone and only married her because he got her pregnant when they were teenagers. Bobbo only truly loves his mistress Mary Fisher, a famous, wealthy romance novelist. When Ruth passionately indicates her disapproval for Bobbo&#x27;s extramarital affair, he calls her a &quot;she-devil&quot;, causing her to reassess her life. She resolves to behave in accordance with the label he has given her.

Bobbo leaves Ruth and their two children and goes to live with Mary, to whom he soon proposes. Ruth plots her revenge on them, beginning by burning down her own house, therefore forcing the children to live with their father at Mary&#x27;s lavish home which is a converted lighthouse. Ruth engages in a string of meaningless sexual relationships in order to emotionally detach herself from sex. In the meantime, she works at the retirement home which houses Mary&#x27;s mother, Pearl. Her actions there cause Pearl to be expelled from the home, thus inconveniencing Mary and Bobbo who must now care for her.

Ruth finds work at a psychiatric hospital while taking classes in accounting and bookkeeping. She uses this knowledge to discreetly steal money from Bobbo&#x27;s corporate clientele in a way that will incriminate Bobbo later on. Ruth starts her own employment agency for female secretaries, under the alias of &quot;Vesta Rose&quot;. Through her agency, she sends a secretary to Bobbo&#x27;s office who begins another affair with him. 
When the police arrive to arrest Bobbo, Ruth has made it appear as though he and the secretary were going to take the stolen money to Switzerland and leave the country, though with the assistance of the same secretary, Ruth is in possession of the money herself, becoming rich as a result. Ruth, nonetheless feels slight sympathy for the secretary and encourages her to send a letter revealing the affair to Mary then arranges for her to take a new job in New Zealand so she can evade the police.
The stress and subsequent expense of his arrest after the problems created by unexpectedly being forced to share her home with Bobbo&#x27;s children, pets and her mother has detrimental effect on Mary&#x27;s physical and mental wellbeing, as a result her writing suffers, leading to further financial struggles.

Under a new alias, Ruth works as a nanny for the children of the judge who presides over Bobbo&#x27;s trial, satisfying his masochistic desires and successfully persuading him to extend Bobbo&#x27;s prison sentence if he is convicted. Bobbo is found guilty and imprisoned. While a desperate Mary turns toward religion for guidance, Ruth manipulates the entire situation by seducing and corrupting a priest, Father Ferguson, and sending him to Mary. Ruth continues to recreate herself with a variety of aliases and love affairs.

Ruth uses her money to change her lifestyle and appearance, undergoing over several years, a series of surgeries to completely restructure her body to be identical to Mary. Mary continues to love Bobbo, spends her entire fortune on Bobbo&#x27;s trial and finally wastes away, developing cancer and ultimately dying. Before her passing away the mansion is purchased by Ruth. Ruth even attends Mary&#x27;s funeral, externally looking like her. She hires Mary&#x27;s former manservant and lover Garcia. Ruth now lives a life of wealth, extravagance, and control, and plans to sexually dominate Bobbo once she secures his release from prison, causing him the misery that he once caused her.

==Editions==
Paperback editions of the novel were issued in 1993 by Ballantine Books, New York () and by Sceptre, London ().

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Death of a She Devil&quot;, was released in the U.K. in 2017.

==In other media==
===Television===
The novel is an expansion of Weldon&#x27;s televsision script &#x27;Watching Me, Watching You&#x27;, written for the series Leap in the Dark. The novel itself was later adapted in 1986 as an award-winning BBC television serial, starring Patricia Hodge as Mary Fisher, Dennis Waterman as Bobbo and Julie T. Wallace as Ruth, with only minor changes from the book.

===Movies===

The novel was adapted less faithfully by Hollywood in 1989 as &quot;She-Devil&quot;, starring Roseanne Barr as Ruth and Meryl Streep as her adversary, Mary.
The 1995 film &quot;Sathi Leelavathi&quot; has a very similar plot to 1989&#x27;s &quot;She-Devil&quot;.

===Radio===
The BBC Radio 4 adaptation was broadcast as a Classic Serial on 21 and 28 February 2016, total duration 106 minutes.

<text>Ladybird Books is a London-based publishing company, trading as a stand-alone imprint within the Penguin Group of companies. The Ladybird imprint publishes mass-market children&#x27;s books.

It is an imprint of Penguin Random House, a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.

==History==
The company traces its origins to 1867, when Henry Wills opened a bookshop in Loughborough, Leicestershire. Within a decade he progressed to printing and publishing guidebooks and street directories. He was joined by William Hepworth in 1904, and the company traded as Wills &amp; Hepworth.

By August 1914, Wills &amp; Hepworth had published their first children&#x27;s books, under the Ladybird imprint. From the beginning, the company was identified by a ladybird logo, at first with open wings, but eventually changed to the more familiar closed-wing ladybird in the late 1950s. The ladybird logo has since undergone several redesigns, the latest of which was launched in 2006.

Wills &amp; Hepworth began trading as Ladybird Books in 1971 as a direct result of the brand recognition that their imprint had achieved in Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s the company&#x27;s Key Words Reading Scheme (launched in 1964) was heavily used by British primary schools, using a reduced vocabulary to help children learn to read. This series of 36 small-format hardback books presented stereotyped models of British family life: the innocence of Peter and Jane at play, Mum the housewife, and Dad the breadwinner. Many of the illustrations in this series were by Harry Wingfield, John Berry, Martin Aitchison, Frank Hampson and Charles Tunnicliffe.

In the 1960s, Ladybird produced the Learnabout series of non-fiction (informational) books, some of which were used by adults as well as children.

An independent company for much of its life, Ladybird Books became part of the Pearson Group in 1972. However, falling demand in the late 1990s led Pearson to fully merge Ladybird into its Penguin Books subsidiary in 1998, joining other established names in British children&#x27;s books such as Puffin Books, Dorling Kindersley and Frederick Warne. The Ladybird offices and printing factory in Loughborough closed the same year, and much of the company&#x27;s archive of historic artwork was transferred to public collections.

In November 2014, Ladybird signed up to the Let Books Be Books campaign and announced that it was &quot;committed&quot; to avoiding labelling books as &quot;for girls&quot; or &quot;for boys&quot; and would be removing such gender labelling in reprinted copies. The publisher added: &quot;Out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print, we actually only have six titles with this kind of titling&quot;. Its parent company, Penguin Random House Children&#x27;s division, would also be following suit.

Imprints of Ladybird Books included Balloon, Paperbird, Sunbird, and Disney.

===Adults and parodies===
In October 2015, it was announced that Ladybird books would be publishing its first series of books for adults. The eight books, which parody the style and artwork of the company’s books for children, include the titles &quot;The Hangover&quot;, &quot;Mindfulness&quot; &quot;Peter Fingers Jane&quot; &quot;Dating&quot; and &quot;The Hipster&quot;, and were written by television comedy writers Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris. They were published on 18 November 2015. The series follows a trend of other spoof Ladybird books including &quot;We Go to the Gallery&quot; by Miriam Elia who had previously been threatened with legal action by Penguin. On 5 July 2016, Touchstone Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, announced that they would publish American adaptations of the Ladybird Books for Grown-ups, called The Fireside Grown-Up Guides.

Ladybird Expert (Series 117) was launched in January 2017 following the success of Ladybird for Grown-Ups. The books in this series are not parodies, but instead use the classic format to serve as clear introductions to a wide variety of subjects, generally in the fields of science and history. The first book published and the inspiration for the series is &quot;Climate Change&quot; by the Prince of Wales, Tony Juniper and Emily Shuckburgh. Four more titles were released in 2017 by Jim Al-Khalili (&quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot;), Steve Jones (&quot;Evolution&quot;), James Holland (&quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;) and Ben Saunders (&quot;Shackleton&quot;). The line was expanded with fifteen further books in 2018 and more titles were published in 2019.

==The classic Ladybird book==
The pocket-sized hardback Ladybird measured roughly four-and-a-half by seven inches (11.5 cm by 18 cm). Early books used a standard 56-page format, chosen because a complete book could be printed on one large standard sheet of paper, a quad crown, 40 inches by 30 inches, which was then folded and cut to size without waste paper. It was an economical way of producing books, enabling the books to be retailed at a low price which, for almost thirty years, remained at two shillings and sixpence (12.5p).

The first book in the line, &quot;Bunnikin&#x27;s Picnic Party: a story in verse for children with illustrations in colour&quot;, was produced in 1940. The book featured stories in verse written by W. Perring, accompanied by full-colour illustrations by A. J. (Angusine Jeanne) MacGregor. The appeal of Bunnikin, Downy Duckling and other animal characters made the book an instant success. Later series included nature books (series 536, some illustrated by, for example, Charles Tunnicliffe and Allen W. Seaby) and a host of non-fiction books, including hobbies and interests, history (L du Garde Peach wrote very many of these) and travel.

Ladybird began publishing books in other formats in 1980. Most of the remaining titles in the classic format were withdrawn in 1999 when their printing facility in Loughborough closed.

<text>Henri-Joseph Harpignies (; June 28, 1819 – August 28, 1916) was a French landscape painter of the Barbizon school.

==Life==
He was born at Valenciennes. His parents intended for him to pursue a business career, but his determination to become an artist was so strong that it conquered all obstacles, and he was allowed at the age of twenty-seven to enter Jean Achard&#x27;s &quot;atelier&quot; in Paris. From this painter he acquired a groundwork of sound constructive draughtsmanship, which is so marked a feature of his landscape painting. After two years under this exacting teacher he went to Italy, whence he returned in 1850.

During the next few years he devoted himself to the painting of children in landscape setting, and fell in with Corot and the other Barbizon masters, whose principles and methods are to a certain extent reflected in his own personal art. To Corot he was united by a bond of warm friendship, and the two artists went together to Italy in 1860.

On his return, he scored his first great success at the Salon, in 1861, with his &quot;Lisière de bois sur les bords de l&#x27;Allier&quot;. After that year he was a regular exhibitor at the old Salon; in 1886 he received his first medal for &quot;Le Soir dans la campagne de Rome&quot;, which was acquired for the Luxembourg Gallery.

Many of his best works were painted at Hérisson in the central France region of Bourbonnais, as well as in the Nivernais and Auvergne regions. 
Among his chief pictures are:
*&quot;Soir sur les bords de la Loire&quot; (1861)
*&quot;Les Corbeaux&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Le Soir&quot; (1866)
*&quot;Le Saut-du-Loup&quot; (1873)
*&quot;La Loire&quot; (1882)
*&quot;Vue de Saint-Privé&quot; (1883).
He also did some decorative work for the Paris Opéra—the &quot;Vallée d&#x27;Egérie&quot; panel, which he showed at the Salon of 1870.

He had numerous students, among them Émile Appay (1876–1935), James Wilson Morrice (1865-1924), Jeanne Rongier, Jane Le Soudier (1885–1976), Louis-Alexandre Cabié, Pierre Vignal, Raymond Verdun, and Émile Dardoize (1826–1901).

<text>Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia was founded in 1859 by William and Robert Chambers of Edinburgh and became one of the most important English language encyclopaedias of the 19th and 20th centuries, developing a reputation for accuracy and scholarliness that was reflected in other works produced by the Chambers publishing company. The encyclopaedia is no longer produced.

== &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Information for the People&quot; ==

Before publishing an encyclopedia, Chambers produced a smaller publication, &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Information for the People&quot;. This began as a serial publication in 1835. Like the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;, and others of the time it was meant to be a cheap reference work that was targeted at the middle and working classes. Hence, it focused only on subjects that would be of interest to the common man and pertinent to his self education. It also eschewed the bulky format that and &quot;found it necessary to disregard all common idea as to what constitutes dignity in the externals of books&quot;. The undertaking was a success, selling seventy thousand issues in its first year. The original edition consisted of 48 numbered &quot;treatises&quot;, plus an unnumbered introductory treatise &quot;An Account of the Earth, Physical and Political.&quot; Improved two volume editions were published in 1842 and 1848. A third improved edition appeared in 1857., shortly before the Chambers Brothers publication of the first edition of their major encyclopedia in 1860. Further new, two volume editions were published in 1875 and 1884, both of which are denominated the &quot;Fifth edition&quot;.

Congruently with this a second series of editions were published in Philadelphia by a succession of publishers including J. B. Lippincott. The 1848 edition is stated to be the first American edition, while the 1856 ed. is claimed to be the 15th. Further American editions were published up to 1867.

==First edition==
The first edition, entitled &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People&quot;, was partly based on a translation into English of the 10th edition of the German-language &quot;Konversations-Lexikon&quot;, which would become the Brockhaus Enzyklopädie.

The publishers found it necessary, however, to supplement the core text with a significant amount of additional material, including more than 4000 illustrations not present in Brockhaus. Andrew Findlater was the acting editor and spent ten years on the project.

The work appeared between 1859 and 1868 in 520 weekly parts at three-halfpence each and totalled ten octavo volumes, with 8,320 pages, and over 27,000 articles from over 100 authors. Over 250 authors were traced by Professor Cooney in 1999. Volume 10 included a supplement of 409 pages at the back for new and revised content. A revised edition appeared in 1874. The index of matters not having special articles contained about 1,500 headings. The articles were generally considered excellent, especially on Jewish literature, folk-lore, and practical science. As in Brockhaus, however, the scope of the work did not allow extended treatment.

==Later editions==
An entirely new edition was published 1888–1892 in ten volumes edited by David Patrick. In this edition, the majority of the articles were rewritten and the articles on American matters were written mainly by Americans and an edition published there by Messrs. Lippincott of Philadelphia so that Lippincott and Chambers could claim relevant copyright in their respective countries. This second edition had about 800 fewer illustrations than the first edition, although other visual features, such as tables and fold-out maps increased.

Further new editions followed in the 1890s, 1901, 1908, the 1920s and 1935. This last edition was also issued as a special &quot;British Universities Encyclopedia&quot;. Each of these kept the 10 volume format. Patrick wrote the preface for the 1901 and 1908 editions and was listed as the editor in the 1920s and 1935 editions, despite having died in 1914. These were actually edited by William Geddie (1877–1967).

In the United States a version of Chambers was published in 1880 as the &quot;Library of Universal Knowledge&quot;. This began the process of creating the &quot;New International Encyclopedia&quot; family of encyclopedias.

==Newnes era==
In 1944 the licence to &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; was acquired by George Newnes, Ltd., which had been publishing one-volume reference works for about a decade. In 1950, &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia. New Edition&quot; was published in fifteen volumes with great fanfare. While being international in scope, it has been described by &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as British in orientation and conservative in approach with largely British contributors. Managing editor Margret D. Law called it a completely new work with an historic name and noted in the preface that the encyclopaedia &quot;...is primarily a British production and therefore no doubt reflects to some extent the intellectual atmosphere of post-war Britain. This implies belief in international co-operation rather than nationalistic isolationism, and in freedom of speech, and worship, information and association rather than in any totalitarian conception&quot;. The publication was celebrated at a luncheon at Grocers&#x27; Hall attended by over one hundred contributors and chaired by Sir Frank Newnes. It was announced that the encyclopaedia, which had taken six years to prepare, had cost £500,000 and included the work of over 2,300 authors. Lord Jowitt, the Lord Chancellor, gave the toast and described the endeavour as &quot;outstanding proof&quot; of British scholarship, while Mrs Law commented that she believed the work to be the first major encyclopaedia to be published in Britain since before the First World War.

Subsequent reports from the publishers, Newnes, confirmed that the work was a great success, with sales requiring regular reprinting; this allowed for considerable revision of the work. By the 1961 revised edition, several million words had been revised or replaced and over half the total pages had been reset or changed in some way. The encyclopaedia was regarded as such a scholarly achievement that Mrs Law was made an OBE for her efforts. She retired in 1963.

Unlike other encyclopedias of the time, &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; forwent annual revision and attempted to publish new editions at roughly five-year intervals. A new edition was published in 1955 and another at the turn of the next decade.

==Pergamon era==
The Encyclopaedia was acquired by Pergamon Press in 1966, the same year as the next edition was published. Despite its publication date, information within the set was not up to date beyond 1963. A revised printing was made in 1973 and the encyclopedia went out of print in 1979.
The final edition included 12,600 pages, 28,000 articles, and 14.5 million words. The articles averaged slightly more than 500 words, or half a page, each. There were 4,500 illustrations, mostly in black and white and 416 maps. 3,000 contributors were listed in the final volume and all but the briefest articles were signed. There were 10,000 cross references and an index of 225,000 entries.

<doc id="838579" wikidata="Q2114792" url="?curid=838579" title="Precordial thump">
<text>Precordial thump is a medical procedure used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia under certain conditions. The procedure has a very low success rate, but may be used in those with witnessed, monitored onset of one of the &quot;shockable&quot; cardiac rhythms if a defibrillator is not immediately available. It should not delay cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, nor should it be used in those with unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

==Procedure==
In a precordial thump, a provider strikes at the middle of a person&#x27;s sternum with the ulnar aspect of the fist. The intent is to interrupt a potentially life-threatening rhythm. The thump is thought to produce an electrical depolarization of 2 to 5 joules.

== Effectiveness ==
The precordial thump may only be effective if administered within seconds of the onset of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. It is not helpful for treating ventricular fibrillation if too much time has passed. It also has very low effectiveness for treating ventricular arrhythmia (possibly even making it worse), and ventricular tachycardia, especially when compared to CPR and defibrillation as alternatives.

Historically, it was recommended as the initial action to take when addressing such witnessed and monitored cardiac arrests in a hospital setting. More recently, European guidelines recommend it should no longer be routinely used with available evidence suggesting it does not improve survival to hospital discharge. However, American guidelines continue advocating its use by healthcare professionals.

==Adverse effects and appearance==
There are concerns that the precordial thump can result in worsening of a person&#x27;s heart rhythm more often than it improves it.

The use of the precordial thump technique has sometimes been shown in famous movies and television, such as in &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; Season 2 episode 5 in which it is performed by Dr. Brown, and &quot;The Resident&quot; Season 1 episode 2 in which it is performed by Conrad Hawkins, usually in passing without any explanation. Untrained laypersons have been known to attempt it, and sometimes cause additional injury to the person as the blow must be carefully aimed. If applied incorrectly it may cause further injury, for instance inducing cardiac arrest by blunt trauma, or breaking the tip of the sternum, risking fatal damage to the liver or other abdominal organs.

At one time, the technique was also taught as part of standard CPR training with the requirement that it must be administered within 60 seconds of the onset of symptoms. That time restriction, combined with a number of injuries caused by improper technique, resulted in the procedure being removed from CPR training.

==History==
James E. Pennington and Bernard Lown at Harvard University are credited with formalizing this technique in the medical literature. They published their report in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in the early 1970s. Richard S. Crampton and George Craddock, at the University of Virginia helped to promote the paramedic use of chest thump through a curious accident. In 1970, the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad (VA) was transporting a patient with an unstable cardiac rhythm in what was then called a Mobile Coronary Care Unit. When the vehicle inadvertently hit a speed bump in a shopping center parking lot, the patient&#x27;s normal heart rhythm was restored. Further research confirmed that chest thumping patients with life-threatening arrhythmias could save lives.

==Fist pacing==
Percussion pacing or fist pacing was proposed as a method of delivering mechanical pacing to someone in cardiac arrest. There is little evidence to support its use. In 1920, German physician Eduard Schott originally described percussion pacing, and a 2007 BJA article describes good benefit to this technique.

<text>Powder Monkeys were an Australian punk, indie rock band, formed in 1991. The founding mainstays, Tim Hemensley, on bass guitar and lead vocals and John Nolan on lead guitar were both ex-members of Bored!. Powder Monkeys released three studio albums, &quot;Smashed on a Knee&quot; (March 1994), &quot;Time Wounds all Heels&quot; (February 1996) and &quot;Lost City Blues&quot; (2000), before they broke up in 2002. Tim Hemensley died on 21 July 2003, aged 31, of a heroin overdose.

==History==
===1980s: Pre Powder Monkeys===
Hemensley had formed GOD as a punk rock group in 1986. Their most popular track, &quot;My Pal&quot;, was released as a single in 1987. They disbanded in July 1989 just before their debut album, &quot;For Lovers Only&quot;, appeared. Hemensley joined Bored! in late 1989 on bass guitar alongside Nolan. The new line-up of Bored! released a seven-track extended play, &quot;Take It out on You&quot; (1990), on Dog Meat Records. Both left after that band&#x27;s 1990 tour of Europe. Nolan then played with Hoss for about a year. The Philisteins were formed by Hibberd on guitar, vocals and harmonica in Hobart as a garage punk outfit in 1985 and had relocated to Melbourne in 1990.

===1991-2002: Powder Monkeys===
Powder Monkeys were established in 1991 in Melbourne by Tim Hemensley on bass guitar and lead vocals (ex-Royal Flush, GOD, Bored!), Adyn Hibberd on rhythm guitar and vocals (ex-the Philisteins), John Nolan on lead guitar (ex-Behind the Magnolia Curtain, Bored!), Timmy Jack Ray on drums and Jed Sayers on harmonica. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, &quot;[their] hard-driving, seething, strung-out, incendiary blend of punk, high energy rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and heavy metal came on like a cross between the Stooges (circa 1973), Motorhead (circa 1976), Rose Tattoo (circa 1978) and US hardcore heroes Black Flag (circa 1980).&quot; However people with in-depth knowledge of the Powder Monkeys know they were part of an unbroken line that began with bands like the MC5 and the Stooges, in cities like Chicago, Detroit and New York. It became known as &#x27;punk&#x27; and arrived in Australia with the Saints and Radio Birdman. It was that first wave of punk, not the &#x27;hardcore punk&#x27; (that came out of the USA after the Sex Pistols) that fans recognised as being in the marrow of the Powder Monkeys. They remain highly respected among punk musicians and fans worldwide.

Powder Monkeys first performed in late 1991 at the Great Britain Hotel, Richmond. Hibberd left around June of the following year. He was recorded on their first single, &quot;Yin Yang&quot;, which was released in February 1993 on Dog Meat Records. Hibberd&#x27;s guitar work appears on a few tracks of the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Smashed on a Knee&quot;, recorded in 1992; also one track he wrote and sang, &quot;Ugly&quot;, was included. The album was released on Dog Meat in March 1994. McFarlane opined, &quot;Despite its uneven, rough-hewn quality, [the album] possessed enough moments of sheer excitement and blazing energy to catapult the band to the forefront of the independent scene.&quot;

Powder Monkeys increased their live performances during 1994 and supported tours by Deniz Tek Group and by Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs. Jed Sayers left at the end of that year and the band continued as a three-piece. They performed at the Big Day Out in Melbourne early in the following year. Their next release, in February 1995, was a five-track EP &quot;Straight Until Morning&quot;, which was recorded by the Hemensley, Nolan and Ray line-up for a Triple J live broadcast.

In November 1995 they supported United States hardcore singer, Henry Rollins, and then supported the re-formed Australian pre-punk rockers, Radio Birdman, in January 1996. Powder Monkeys released a single, &quot;The Supernova That Never Quits&quot; in December 1995, ahead of their second album, &quot;Time Wounds all Heels&quot; in February 1996. It was produced by Chris Thompson, with McFarlane declaring, &quot;[it] was almost the definitive example of the band&#x27;s skilful, diamond-hard blues thrash.&quot; &quot;Tharunka&quot;″s reviewer noticed that the band members, &quot;have all had Seattle-grunge bypass operations, allowing them to get on with some serious rock action&quot; and that the album, &quot;is powerful, basic and honest rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, played with instinct and the amps turned up loud.&quot;

Hemensley and Ray also performed and recorded with the Peter Wells Band in 1996, which resulted in an album, &quot;Go Ahead Call the Cops&quot;, produced by the band and released in October that year on Dog Meat and Shock Records. There was interest from the US music industry&#x27;s American Recordings in a local release of &quot;Time Wounds All Heels&quot; and a tour, but nothing resulted. Powder Monkeys spent most of 1997 in hiatus and re-emerged in August 1997 with a single, &quot;Get the Girl Straight&quot; (400 copies, red vinyl), on the Death Valley label.

Most of 1998 was spent touring. A live album, &quot;Blood Sweat &amp; Beers&quot;, was recorded at a gig at The Espy, Melbourne in April. It was released early in 1999 on Safety Pin Records (Spain) and on CD via Butcher&#x27;s Hook Records (United Kingdom). They supported a gig by Swedish garage rockers, the Hellacopters in October in Melbourne. They followed with a European tour from March 1999 for three months. While on tour they recorded two tracks, &quot;Two Tub Man&quot; and &quot;Destination X&quot;, both released as split 7-inch singles with the other tracks by the Hellacopters.

Powder Monkeys also recorded a new studio album, &quot;Lost City Blues&quot; which was released in 2000, with Swedish producer, Fred Estby on their White Jazz label. The album has never seen an Australian release. An EP was also recorded in Spain, &quot;Talk Softly &amp; Carry a Big Shtick&quot;, which was released on Punch Records. 

Timmy Jack Ray departed the group shortly after and was replaced by Todd McNear on drums (ex-Seminal Rats). John Nolan had a near-fatal heart attack in 2001, the result of his heroin use, and was left with slightly impaired motor skills. He later reflected on his addiction, &quot;It never affected playing live or touring but I do remember a few times during the recording when I would have to wait until my dealer rocked up at the studio in the morning for me to pretty much &#x27;get going&#x27; and stop feeling like total crap and start playing.&quot; Nolan spent several months recovering, and the group reconvened in 2002, recording a song for the &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; soundtrack as well as a cover of legendary Detroit band The Dogs&#x27; &quot;Black Tea&quot;. They played their first gig in over a year at the Tote, supporting punk legends The Dictators, and shortly after supporting Dead Moon. These were to be the last Powder Monkeys gigs.

After a lengthy addiction to heroin, Tim Hemensley died from an overdose on 21 July 2003, aged 31. It was a devastating blow to the Melbourne rock scene, which had been severely depleted in previous years with the deaths of Guy Lucas (the Philisteins, Freeloaders), Mick Weber (Seminal Rats), and Sean Greenway (GOD, Freeloaders, The Yes-Men).

The final recordings by Powder Monkeys were compiled on a CD, &quot;Outta Control Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot;, released posthumously on the Dropkick label in 2005. It included three new songs recorded live at Greenway&#x27;s wake in 2001, as well as studio recordings of cover versions including the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Cock in My Pocket&quot;, a staple of their live sets. The group were reformed in July 2013 by Nolan and Ray using guest vocalists in tribute to Hemensley on the tenth anniversary of his death.

Nolan died in December 2021.

<text>Susanna Moore (born December 9, 1945) is an American writer and teacher. Born in Pennsylvania but raised in Hawaii, Moore worked as a model and script reader in Los Angeles and New York City before beginning her career as a writer. Her first novel, &quot;My Old Sweetheart&quot;, published in 1982, earned a PEN Hemingway nomination, and won the Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She followed this with &quot;The Whiteness of Bones&quot; in 1989, and her third novel, &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot;, in 1993. All three of these novels were set in Hawaii and charted dysfunctional family relationships.

Moore gained particular critical notice for her fourth novel, &quot;In the Cut&quot; (1995), which marked a departure from her previous works in both setting and content, concerning a New York City teacher who has a sexual affair with a detective investigating violent murders and dismemberments in her neighborhood. It was adapted into a 2003 feature film of the same name by director Jane Campion.

==Biography==
Moore was born December 9, 1945, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Shortly after her birth, her family relocated to Hawaii, where she spent her formative years, and attended the Punahou School in Honolulu. She is the oldest of seven children, and was raised by her widowered father, a physician; her mother died in her childhood.

At age seventeen, Moore returned to the mainland United States to live in Philadelphia with her grandmother. She later lived in New York City and Los Angeles, working as a model and script reader. For a time in the late 1960s, she worked as Warren Beatty&#x27;s assistant in California. She published her first book, &quot;My Old Sweetheart&quot;, in 1982, followed by &quot;The Whiteness of Bones&quot; in 1989, and &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot; in 1993—all three books, set in her home state of Hawaii, dealt with themes of familial dysfunction. For &quot;My Old Sweetheart&quot;, Moore earned a PEN Hemingway nomination, and won the Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Her fourth novel, &quot;In the Cut&quot; (1995), a thriller novel about a teacher in New York City who begins a sexual relationship with a detective investigating nearby murders, marked a notable departure from Moore&#x27;s previous works, and was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 2003 by director Jane Campion.

In 1999, she received the Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Moore went on to publish two works in 2003: the British India-set novel &quot;One Last Look&quot;, and the non-fiction &quot;I Myself Have Seen It: The Myth of Hawai‘i&quot;, an autobiographical work that explored Moore&#x27;s upbringing in Hawaii.

In 2006, Moore received a Fellowship in Literature at the American Academy in Berlin; and in 2006 she received a Fellowship in Literature from the Asian Cultural Council, which entailed a three-month fellowship to research on the Meiji Period in Japan.

Moore was a visiting lecturer in Creative Writing at Yale University in 1988, 1989 and 1994; visiting lecturer at New York Graduate School in 1995; creative writing teacher at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn between 2004 and 2006; and lecturer of creative writing at Princeton University between 2007 and 2009. During May to August 2009, Moore was Writer-in-Residence at Australia&#x27;s University of Adelaide. As of a 2012 interview, Moore resided in her home state of Hawaii, though she returns to the East Coast each year to teach courses at Princeton University for the fall semester.
Moore has a daughter, Lulu, with production designer and art director Richard Sylbert, and later lived with Michael Laughlin. Lulu acted as a child, playing Paul Le Mat&#x27;s half-alien daughter in &quot;Strange Invaders&quot;.

<text>Narcisse Virgilio Díaz de la Peña (20 August 180718 November 1876) was a French painter of the Barbizon school.

==Early life==
Diaz was born in Bordeaux to Spanish parents. At the age of ten, Diaz became an orphan, and misfortune dogged his early years. His foot was bitten by a reptile in Meudon wood, near Sèvres, where he had been taken to live with some friends of his mother. The bite was poorly dressed, and ultimately he lost his leg. However, as it turned out, the wooden stump that replaced his leg became famous.

At fifteen he entered the studios at Sèvres, first working on the decoration of porcelain and later turning to painting. Turkish and Oriental scenes attracted him, and he took to painting Eastern figures dressed in richly coloured garments; many of these paintings remain extant. He also spent much time at Barbizon, near the Fontainebleau Forest, where some of his most famous paintings were made. One of his teachers and friends in Paris was François Souchon.

Around 1831 Díaz encountered Théodore Rousseau, for whom he possessed a great veneration, despite the fact that Rousseau was four years younger. At Fontainebleau Díaz found Rousseau painting his wonderful forest pictures, and was determined to paint in the same way if possible. However, Rousseau was then in poor health, embittered against the world, and consequently was difficult to approach. On one occasion, Diaz followed him surreptitiously to the forest, with his wooden leg hindering his advance, but he dodged around after the painter, trying to observe his method of work. After a time Díaz found a way to become friendly with Rousseau, and revealed his eagerness to understand the latter&#x27;s techniques. Rousseau was touched with the passionate words of admiration, and finally taught Diaz all he knew.

Díaz exhibited many pictures at the Paris Salon, and was decorated in 1851 with the rank of Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d’honneur. During the Franco-German War (1870-1871) he went to Brussels. After 1871, his works became fashionable and rose gradually in the estimation of collectors, and he worked constantly and successfully. Díaz&#x27;s finest pictures are his forest scenes and storms, and it is on these that his fame rests. There are several examples of his work in the Louvre, and three small figure pictures in the Wallace Collection, Hertford House. Perhaps the most notable of Diaz&#x27;s works are &quot;The Pearl Fairy&quot; (1857); &quot;Sunset in the Forest&quot; (1868); &quot;The Forest of Fontainebleau&quot; (1870), and &quot;The Storm&quot; (1871). The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds some two dozen works by Díaz, including another version of &quot;The Forest of Fontainebleau&quot; and many drawings and studies.

Diaz himself had no well-known pupils, but François Visconti emulated his work to some degree and Léon Richet followed markedly his methods of tree-painting. For a period, Jean-François Millet also painted small figures in avowed imitation of Diaz&#x27;s then popular subjects. Renoir once said &quot;my hero was Díaz&quot;. In 1876, while visiting his son&#x27;s grave, he caught a cold. He went to Menton in an attempt to recover his health, but on 18 November that year he died.

Díaz&#x27;s son, Eugène-Émile (1837–1901), achieved some fame as composer Eugène Diaz.

The rue Narcisse Diaz in Auteuil, Paris is named after him.

<text>Holmen AB is a Swedish company which bases its business in the forest industry and the pulp and paper industry. Holmen&#x27;s main products are paperboard for consumer packaging and graphical applications. Printing paper for magazines, supplements, direct mail, directories, books and newspapers. Holmen also produce sawn timber for flooring, window components, furniture or construction.

==History==
Holmen was originally called &quot;Mo och Domsjö AB&quot; (MoDo), a Swedish company created in 1874. 
Carl Kempe (1799-1872), a Pomeranian-born merchant, originally partnered with his brother-in-law, but was from 1836 single owner of a sawmill in &quot;Mo&quot;, at the river Moälven, near Örnsköldsvik in northern Sweden. Carl Kempe later established a steam-powered sawmill at Domsjö on Moälven. The latter has been running as an independent company called Domsjö Fabriker since 2000, and in 2011 it was acquired by India&#x27;s Aditya Birla Group.

The company &quot;Mo och Domsjö AB&quot; was created in 1874 by Carl Kempe&#x27;s sons from these holdings, among several other industries controlled by the Kempe family. It was led at various times by the brothers Bernhard (1830-1908), Wilhelm and Frans Kempe (1847-1924) and remained in the control of the Kempe family for most of the next century.

Originally producing and exporting timber, the company moved into pulp and paper at the end of the 19th and early years of the 20th century and into wood-based chemicals during the middle part of the 20th century. The name was usually abbreviated to Modo and has since 1963 through sponsoring given its name to the ice hockey team Modo Hockey.

The company was merged with the Norrköping-based industrial company Holmens Bruk AB in 1988 under the name Mo och Domsjö AB.

In February 2000, the group changed its name to Holmen AB.

In June 2016 the newsprint mill in Madrid, Spain, was sold to International Paper.

==Organisation==

Holmen consists of several subsidiaries: Holmen Paper, Iggesund Paperboard, Iggesund Timber, Holmen Skog and Holmen Energi. The largest one is Holmen Paper with a total of two paper mills in Sweden; Hallsta and Braviken. 
Iggesund Paperboard has two paperboard mills; one in Iggesund, Sweden and one in Workington, England,

==Sustainability==
In January 2017 Holmen was ranked number 21 on the Global 100.

==Owners==
The largest owner in Holmen is L E Lundbergföretagen, controlled by billionaire Fredrik Lundberg with 32.9% of the shares and 61.6% of the total vote.

==Markets==
The European market makes up about 88% of Holmen&#x27;s total net sales. Holmen&#x27;s single largest market is Sweden, with 24% of the net sales.

==Products==
The business area Iggesund Paperboard produces paperboard for use in the premium packaging and graphics sectors. The brands consist of Invercote and Inverform produced at the Iggesund Mill and Incada produced at the Workington Mill.

The business area Holmen Paper produces paper for magazines, catalogues, direct mail, supplements, book paper and gift wrap at the two paper mills. The brands include: Holmen TRND, Holmen VIEW, Holmen UNIQ, Holmen NEWS, Holmen GIFT, Holmen XLNT, Holmen PLUS and Holmen BOOK.

The business area Holmen Timber makes construction timber and joinery timber at three sawmills in Sweden.

<doc id="838610" wikidata="Q2478010" url="?curid=838610" title="Russian orthography">
<text>Russian orthography () is an orthographic tradition formally considered to encompass spelling () and punctuation (). Russian spelling, which is mostly phonemic in practice, is a mix of &quot;morphological&quot; and &quot;phonetic&quot; principles, with a few &quot;etymological&quot; or &quot;historic&quot; forms, and occasional &quot;grammatical&quot; differentiation. The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reformulated on the models of French and German orthography.

The attempts to reflect vowel reduction when not under stress. The sounds that are presented are those of the standard language; other dialects may have noticeably different pronunciations for the vowels.

==Spelling==
Russian is written with a modern variant of the Cyrillic script. Russian spelling typically avoids arbitrary digraphs. Except for the use of hard and soft signs, which have no phonetic value in isolation but can follow a consonant letter, no phoneme is ever represented with more than one letter.

===Morphological principle===
Under the morphological principle, the morphemes (roots, suffixes, infixes, and inflexional endings) are attached without modification; the compounds may be further agglutinated. For example, the long adjective шарикоподшипниковый, sharikopodshipnikoviy (&#x27;pertaining to ball bearings&#x27;), may be decomposed as follows (words having independent existence in boldface):

Note again that each component in the final production retains its basic form, despite the vowel reduction.

The phonetic assimilation of consonant clusters also does not usually violate the morphological principle of the spelling. For example, the decomposition of счастье (&#x27;happiness, good fortune&#x27;) is as follows:

Note the assimilation with - so that it represents the same sound (or cluster) as -. The spelling &lt;щастие&gt; was fairly common among the literati in the eighteenth century, but is usually frowned upon today.

===Phonetic principle===
The phonetic principle implies that:
* all morphemes are written as they are pronounced in isolation, &quot;without vowel reduction&quot;, Church Slavonic style, or, more strictly, taking inflexion into account (this in combination with the morphological agglutination described above is sometimes called the morphemic principle);
* certain prefixes that end in a voiced consonant (in practice, only those in - ) have that consonant devoiced (become ) to voicing assimilation. This may be reflected orthographically. For example, for the prefix/preposition &quot;без&quot; &#x27;without&#x27;:

* certain roots and prefixes occasionally have their vowel modified in individual cases to reflect historical changes in pronunciation, usually as a result of being unstressed or, conversely, stressed. In practice, this usually applies to -- changing to -- or (&quot;akanye&quot;), and alternations between the allophonic vowels and (represented by and respectively):
* borrowed words and foreign names are usually spelled as orthographic transcriptions, or, more precisely, mixed transcriptions-transliterations based mainly on original pronunciation (Jacques-Yves Cousteau is rendered in Russian as Жак-Ив Кусто; the English name Paul is rendered as Пол, the French name Paul as Поль, the German name Paul as Пауль) but also on original spelling (the German surnames Schmied, Schmidt, Schmitt are rendered in Russian as Шмид, Шмидт, Шмитт). In particular, double consonants are usually retained from original spelling when their pronunciation is not normally geminated. In addition, unpalatalized consonants are usually followed by rather than (e.g. кафе ,&#x27;café&#x27;); 19th-century linguists, such as Yakov Karlovich Grot, considered unpalatalized pronunciation of consonants before to be foreign to Russian, though this has now become the standard for many loanwords.

Pronunciation may also deviate from normal phonological rules. For example, unstressed (spelled ) is usually pronounced or , but радио (&#x27;radio&#x27;) is pronounced , with an unstressed final .

===Etymological principle===
The fact that Russian has retained much of its ancient phonology has made the historical or etymological principle (dominant in languages like English, French, and Irish) less relevant. Because the spelling has been adjusted to reflect the changes in the pronunciation of the yers and to eliminate letters with identical pronunciation, the only systematic examples occur in some foreign words and in some of the inflectional endings, both nominal and verbal, which are not always written as they are pronounced. For example:

===Grammatical principle===
The grammatical principle has become stronger in contemporary Russian. It specifies conventional orthographic forms to mark grammatic distinctions (gender, participle vs. adjective, and so on). Some of these rules are ancient, and could perhaps be considered etymological; some are based in part on subtle, and not necessarily universal, distinctions in pronunciation; and some are practically arbitrary. Some characteristic examples follow.

For nouns ending in a sibilant - , - , - , - , a soft sign is appended in the nominative singular if the gender is feminine, and is not appended if masculine:

: Neither of the aforementioned consonants has phonemically distinct palatalized and unpalatalized variants. Hence, the use of in these examples is not to indicate a different pronunciation, but to help distinguish different grammatical genders. A common noun ending in a consonant without - is masculine while a noun ending in - is often feminine (though there are some masculine nouns ending in a &quot;soft&quot; consonant, with the - marking a different pronunciation).
: Though based on common ancient etymology, by which a hard sign ъ was appended to masculine nouns before 1918, both symbols having once been pronounced as ultra-short (&quot;reduced&quot;) vowels (called &quot;yers&quot; in Slavic studies), the modern rule is nevertheless grammatical, because its application has been made more nearly universal.

The past passive participle has a doubled -- , while the same word used as an adjective has a single -- :

:This rule is partly guided by pronunciation, but the geminated pronunciation is not universal. The rule is therefore considered one of the difficult points of Russian spelling, since the distinction between adjective (implying state) and participle (implying action) is not always clear. A proposal in the late 1990s to simplify this rule by basing the distinction on whether or not the verb is transitive has not been formally adopted.

Prepositional phrases in which the literal meaning is preserved are written with the words separated; when used adverbially, especially if the meaning has shifted, they are usually written as a single word:

: (This is extracted from a whole set of extremely detailed rules about run-together, hyphenated, or separated components. Such rules are essentially arbitrary. There are enough sub-cases, exceptions, undecidable points, and inconsistencies that even well-educated native speakers sometimes have to check in a dictionary. Arguments about this issue have been continuous for 150 years.)

==Punctuation==
===Basic symbols===
The full stop (period) (.), colon (:), semicolon (;), comma (,), question mark (?), exclamation mark (!), and ellipsis (…) are equivalent in shape to the basic symbols of punctuation (знаки препинания ) used for the common European languages, and follow the same general principles of usage.
The colon is used exclusively as a means of introduction, and never, as in slightly archaic English, to mark a periodic pause intermediate in strength between the semicolon and the full stop (period) (cf. H.W. Fowler, &quot;The Kingˈs English&quot;, 1908).

===Comma usage===
The comma is used very liberally to mark the end of introductory phases, on either side of simple appositions, and to introduce all subordinate clauses. The English distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive clauses does not exist:

===Hyphenation===
The hyphen (-), and em dash (—) are used to mark increasing levels of separation. The hyphen is put between components of a word, and the em-dash to separate words in a sentence, in particular to mark longer appositions or qualifications that in English would typically be put in parentheses, and as a replacement for a copula:

In short sentences describing a noun (but generally not a pronoun unless special poetic emphasis is desired) in present tense (as a substitution for a modal verb &quot;быть/есть&quot; (to be)):

===Direct speech===
Quotes are not used to mark paragraphed direct quotation, which is instead separated out by the em-dash (—):

===Quotation===
Inlined direct speech and other quotation is marked at the first level by guillemets «», and by lowered and raised reversed double quotes („“) at the second:

Unlike American English, the period or other terminal punctuation is placed &quot;outside&quot; the quotation. As the example above demonstrates, the quotes are often used to mark the names of entities introduced with the generic word.

===Parenthetical expressions===
These are introduced with the international symbol of parentheses (). However, their use is typically restricted to pure asides, rather than, as in English, to mark apposition.

==Controversies==

===Spelling===
As in many languages, the spelling was formerly quite more phonemic and less consistent. However, the influence of the major grammarians, from Meletius Smotrytsky (1620s) to Lomonosov (1750s) to Grot (1880s), ensured a more careful application of morphology and etymology.

Today, the balance between the morphological and phonetic principles is well established. The etymological inflexions are maintained by tradition and habit, although their non-phonetic spelling has occasionally prompted controversial calls for reform (as in the periods 1900–1910, 1960–1964). A primary area where the spelling is utterly inconsistent and therefore controversial is:
* the complexity (or even correctness) of some of the grammatical principles, especially with respect to the strung-together, hyphenated, or disjoint writing of the constituent morphemes.

These two points have been the topic of scientific debate since at least the middle of the nineteenth century.

In the past, uncertainty abounded about which of the ordinary or iotated/palatalizing series of vowels to allow after the sibilant consonants , , , , , which, as mentioned above, are not standard in their hard/soft pairs. This problem, however, appears to have been resolved by applying the phonetic and grammatical principles (and to a lesser extent, the etymological) to define a complicated though internally consistent set of spelling rules.

In 2000–2001, a minor revision of the 1956 codification was proposed. It met with public protest and has not been formally adopted.

==1918 Bolshevik reform==
Russian orthography was simplified by unifying several adjectival and pronominal inflections, conflating the letter &#x27; (Yat) with &#x27;, &#x27; with &#x27;, and &#x27; and &#x27; with &#x27;. Additionally, the archaic mute &quot;yer&quot; became obsolete, including the &#x27; (the &quot;hard sign&quot;) in final position following consonants (thus eliminating practically the last graphical remnant of the Old Slavonic open-syllable system). For instance, became (&quot;Rybinsk&quot;).

Examples:
* &#x27; to &#x27; – The United States of America (, popular pre-revolutionary name of the United States in Russia)
* &#x27; to &#x27;
* &#x27; to &#x27; (Petrograd) 
* &#x27; to &#x27; (region/district) 
* &#x27; to &#x27; (marathon) 
* &#x27; to &#x27; (children) 
* &#x27; to &#x27; (Jesus Christ)

===Practical implementation===
In December 1917, the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education, headed by A. V. Lunacharsky, issued a decree stating, &quot;All state and government institutions and schools without exception should carry out the transition to the new orthography without delay. From 1 January 1918, all government and state publications, both periodical and non-periodical were to be printed in the new style.&quot; The decree was nearly identical to the proposals put forth by the May Assembly, and with other minor modifications formed the substance of the decree issued by the Soviet of People&#x27;s Commissars in October 1918.

Although occasionally praised by the Russian working class, the reform was unpopular amongst the educated people, religious leaders and many prominent writers, many of whom were oppositional to the new state. Furthermore, even the workers ridiculed the spelling reform at first, arguing it made the Russian language poorer and less elegant.

In this way, private publications could formally be printed using the old (or more generally, any convenient) orthography. The decree forbade the retraining of people previously trained under the old norm. A given spelling was considered a misspelling only if it violated both the old and the new norms.
However, in practice, the Soviet government rapidly set up a monopoly on print production and kept a very close eye on the fulfillment of the edict. A common practice was the forced removal of not just the letters , , and from printing offices, but also . Because of this, the usage of the apostrophe as a dividing sign became widespread in place of (e.g., , instead of , ), and came to be perceived as a part of the reform (even if, from the point of view of the letter of the decree of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, such uses were mistakes). People resisting the implementation of the new orthography were deemed enemies of the people and executed. Nonetheless, some academic printings (connected with the publication of old works, documents or printings whose typesettings predated the revolution) came out in the old orthography (except title pages and, often, prefaces) up until 1929.

===Simplification===
The reform reduced the number of orthographic rules having no support in pronunciation—for example, the difference of the genders in the plural and the need to learn a long list of words which were written with yats (the composition of said list was controversial among linguists, and different spelling guides contradicted one another).

The reform resulted in some economy in writing and typesetting, due to the exclusion of at the end of words—by the reckoning of Lev Uspensky, text in the new orthography was shorter by one-thirtieth.

The reform removed pairs of completely homophonous graphemes from the Russian alphabet (i.e., and ; and ; and the trio of , and ), bringing the alphabet closer to the Russian language&#x27;s actual phonological system.
===Criticism===

According to critics, the choice of &quot;Ии&quot; as the only letter to represent that side and the removal of &quot;Іі&quot; defeated the purpose of &#x27;simplifying’ the language, as &quot;Ии&quot; occupies more space and, furthermore, is sometimes indistinguishable from &quot;Шш&quot;.

The reform also created many homographs and homonyms, which used to be spelled differently. Examples: есть/ѣсть (to be/eat) and миръ/міръ (peace/the World) became &quot;есть&quot; and &quot;мир&quot; in both instances.

In a complex system of cases, -аго was replaced with -его (лучшаго → лучшего), in other instances -аго was replaced with -ого, -яго with -его (e.g., новаго → нового, ранняго → раннего), feminine cases moved from -ыя, -ія — to -ые, -ие (новыя (книги, изданія) → новые);
Feminine pronouns онѣ, однѣ, однѣхъ, однѣмъ, однѣми were replaced with они, одни, одних, одним, одними; ея (нея) was replaced with на её (неё).

The latter was especially controversial, as these feminine pronouns had been deep-rooted in the language and extensively used by writers and poets.

Prefixes ending with underwent a change: now all of them (except ) end with before voiceless consonants and with before voiced consonants or vowels (, but ). Previously, the prefixes showed concurrence between phonetic (as now) and morphological (always &quot;з&quot;) spellings; at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the standard rule was: &quot; &quot; were always written in this way; other prefixes ended with &quot;с&quot; before voiceless consonants except &quot;с&quot; and with &quot;з&quot; otherwise (, but ). Earlier 19th-century works also sometimes used &quot;з&quot; before &quot;ц, ч, ш, щ&quot;.

<text>Gloria Winters (November 28, 1931 – August 14, 2010) was an actress most remembered for having portrayed the well-mannered niece, Penny King, in the 1950s–1960s American television series &quot;Sky King&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born Gloria Carolyn Hirst in Los Angeles on November 28, 1931, She grew up in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, and later moved to Hollywood with her family. A child actress, she made her debut, she said in a mid-2000s radio interview, &quot;when I was about five&quot;, with a small role in a Shirley Temple movie. &quot;I came running out to Shirley Temple, and she was supposed to help me, like I had just gone to the little girls&#x27; room.&quot;

Winters went on to a Pete Smith movie short, in a scene of her coming down a slide to the grass, where a black Scottie dog licked her face. She also appeared in an &quot;Our Gang&quot; feature. She performed onstage, and took tap dance classes, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s was first cast in Western films such as &quot;Driftwood&quot; (1947) and &quot;El Paso&quot; (1949), and in such television series as &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;The Range Rider&quot; and &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot;. Her roughly twenty films, mostly Westerns, include &quot;The Lawless&quot; (1950) and &quot;Gambling House&quot; (1951).

She portrayed daughter Babs Riley in the first season of the NBC sitcom &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; (1949 to 1950), starring Jackie Gleason and Rosemary DeCamp.

===&quot;Sky King&quot;===
Winters&#x27; signature role was in the television drama &quot;Sky King&quot;, starring Kirby Grant as rancher and pilot Schuyler &quot;Sky&quot; King in Arizona of the 1950s. Winters played the blonde, baby-faced, perky but earnest, and helpful teenage niece, Penny King, who lived with her uncle at the Flying Crown Ranch and often became involved in his varied adventures. She played the role in seventy-two episodes from 1952 to 1959. Ron Hagerthy appeared in nineteen episodes during 1952 as Sky King&#x27;s nephew and Penny&#x27;s brother, Clipper. &quot;Sky King&quot; ran on NBC and ABC, and was filmed from 1951 to 1952 and from 1955 through at least 1959, as sponsors changed. It ran after that in syndication, but the actors received no residuals.

During the run of &quot;Sky King&quot;, Winters and Kirby Grant performed as a song-and-dance team as headliners on the state fair circuit. Winters recalled a State Fair of Texas in Dallas in which the two signed autographs. Waiting for their signatures were astronauts Gus Grissom, Pete Conrad, Alan Shepard, and Wally Schirra in line with their children. As the magazine publisher &quot;Airport Journal&quot; noted, the series &quot;Sky King&quot; inspired several youngsters to take up flying when they became older.

Winters married Dean Stevens Vernon, a sound engineer on &quot;Sky King&quot;, and gave up acting following a 1960 appearance on Hugh O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s ABC western series, &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;.

==Other roles==
In the interim, Winters had guest roles in series, including the anthology &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;; &quot;Racket Squad&quot;; &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot;, in which she made her singing debut in the 1951 episode &quot;Warning! Danger!&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot;, &quot;Brave Eagle&quot;, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot;, &quot;Judge Roy Bean&quot; (in the episode &quot;Four Ladies from Laredo&quot;), &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot;, and &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot;.

On Jim Davis&#x27; &quot;Stories of the Century&quot; anthology series, Winters played the teenaged bandit Little Britches, opposite James Best as the outlaw Dave Ridley, with whom she is smitten.

During this time, Winters appeared in movies, including &quot;Hold That Line&quot; (1952), starring the Bowery Boys, and &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot;.

===Later life===
In 1964, Winters wrote &quot;Penny&#x27;s Guide to Teen-Age Charm and Popularity&quot; (Prentice Hall), an etiquette book aimed at young girls, which inspired the alternative rock band Nada Surf&#x27;s 1996 song and video &quot;Popular.&quot; As well, Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s song &quot;Pencil Thin Mustache&quot; contains a reminiscence about being &quot;bucktoothed and skinny ... writin&#x27; fan letters to Sky&#x27;s niece Penny.&quot;

When her husband retired, the two moved to Vista, California. He died in 2001, and Winters succumbed nine years later of complications from pneumonia at her home. She was survived by her sister-in-law Phyllis DeCinces and was interred alongside her husband at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego.

==Awards==
In 2002, she was awarded the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund&#x27;s Golden Boot Award for her work in Western films and television programs.

<text>Pierre-François Casgrain, (August 4, 1886 – August 2, 1950) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He was Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons from 1936 to 1940.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, his father was a physician. Following the death of his mother when he was three years old, he was raised by his grandmother. Casgrain graduated in law from Université Laval in Montreal and practiced in Montreal where he worked as an organizer for the Liberal Party of Canada and the Quebec Liberal Party.

When his father-in-law, Sir Rodolphe Forget, the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Charlevoix, retired from politics, Casgrain decided to run for the seat as a Liberal in the 1917 election. The campaign occurred as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. Casgrain ran as an opponent of the draft (&quot;see Laurier Liberals&quot;, and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada.

From 1921 to 1925, Casgrain was the parliamentary whip of the Quebec Liberal caucus, and from 1926 to 1936, he was the Chief Whip of the Liberal caucus.

Casgrain was nominated by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to be Speaker of the House in 1936. He served in this position until 1940 when he was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Canada, a position that had sweeping emergency powers during World War II. On December 15, 1941, Casgrain was appointed Puisne Judge of the Superior Court of Quebec and retired from politics. He died in 1950.

After his death in 1950, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

Casgrain&#x27;s wife, Thérèse Casgrain, was a prominent political figure in her own right.

There is a Pierre-François Casgrain fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<text>Kirby Grant (November 24, 1911 – October 30, 1985), born Kirby Grant Hoon Jr., was a long-time B movie and television actor, mostly remembered for having played the title role in the Western-themed adventure television series &quot;Sky King&quot;. Between 1949 and 1954, Grant starred in 10 Mounted-Police adventures, usually in the role of Corporal Rod Webb.

==Early life and career==
Grant was born in Butte in Silver Bow County in southwestern Montana. He was a child prodigy violinist. He continued to study music and became a professional singer and bandleader.

==Movie career==
In 1939 the &quot;Gateway to Hollywood&quot; talent-search contest awarded him a movie contract. These &quot;Gateway&quot; contracts were already prepared with fictitious screen names (thus Josephine Cottle became &quot;Gale Storm&quot; and Ralph Bowman became &quot;John Archer&quot;; Grant won with Dorothy Howe, who became &quot;Virginia Vale&quot;). Grant&#x27;s contract was made out to &quot;Robert Stanton,&quot; and Grant used the pseudonym in his earliest films before adopting his first and middle names professionally. &quot;Robert Stanton&quot; and &quot;Virginia Vale&quot; were introduced in the RKO Radio Pictures feature &quot;Three Sons&quot;, with Edward Ellis and William Gargan. For the next few years Grant freelanced among various studios; his most familiar picture from this period (as Kirby Grant) is probably &quot;Blondie Goes Latin&quot;, a 1941 film with Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake.
Grant also appeared briefly in the 1943 submarine picture &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot;, playing the role of Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, organizer of the famous Doolittle Raid on Japan.

In 1943, Grant signed with Universal Pictures, where he played romantic leads in B musicals, and in Abbott and Costello and Olsen and Johnson comedies. His smooth baritone voice got him teamed with Universal&#x27;s singing star Gloria Jean for two features in 1944, and then Universal selected him to replace Rod Cameron (who had just been promoted to more important roles) as the studio&#x27;s B-Western series star in 1945. These seven westerns established Kirby Grant as an action star. In 1949 Monogram Pictures hired him for a series of Mountie adventures, featuring &quot;Chinook the Wonder Dog.&quot; Grant was working in this capacity when television beckoned in 1952 with the contemporary series &quot;Sky King&quot;.

==&quot;Sky King&quot;==
Grant starred in the series &quot;Sky King&quot; during its entire run (1952, and 1956–59), filming 72 episodes in all. He played Arizona rancher-pilot Schuyler &quot;Sky&quot; King, who fought bad guys and rescued people with his airplane. Early villains were bank robbers and kidnappers; some later foils were Russian spies and saboteurs. Sky&#x27;s first airplane was a Cessna T-50 (known among pilots as the &quot;Bamboo Bomber&quot; because of its wooden wings), and later a much more modern Cessna 310B. Sky&#x27;s airplanes were named &quot;Songbird&quot;. Sky and his niece Penny, played by Gloria Winters, lived on the &quot;Flying Crown Ranch&quot;.

==Later appearances and retirement==
Grant did little acting after &quot;Sky King&quot; ended, although he and Gloria Winters were in demand for personal appearances at fairs and aviation events. He traveled with the Carson and Barnes Circus from 1965 to 1967. Grant retired in 1970. &quot;Sky King&quot; continued to play in reruns from 1959 to 1966, but Grant received no residuals.

Grant and his wife, Carolyn, had three children. In the early 1970s, the Grants moved from California to Florida.

The couple founded the nonprofit Sky King Youth Ranches of America, which provided homes for abandoned or orphaned children. He had plans to resurrect the &quot;Sky King&quot; series with the Flying Crown Ranch becoming a home for such kids, and publicizing their stories, but it never materialized.

==Death==
At about 8 a.m. on October 30, 1985, Grant was killed in an automobile accident west of Titusville in Brevard County, Florida. Three vehicles were traveling east bound in single file, Grant was in the third vehicle. He pulled out of line (to the left) to pass both vehicles in front of him, when the middle vehicle also pulled out to pass at the same time. To avoid a collision, Grant suddenly swerved farther left, and went onto the shoulder of the oncoming lane, he then over-corrected back all the way to the right, when his vehicle left the roadway and spun into a ditch, which contained three feet of standing water. Grant was thrown out of his car and into the water. A passerby pulled him out, and he was taken to Jess Parrish Hospital in Titusville, but was dead on arrival. That morning, Grant was en route from his condominium in Winter Springs to the Kennedy Space Center to watch the (last successful) launch of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; at Cape Canaveral. He was to have been honored by the astronauts for encouraging aviation and space flight. He was 73 years old. Kirby is interred in Missoula, Montana.

== Recording career ==
Kirby Grant is listed as the recording artist on two Wizard Records singles, #245-A &quot;Loving Time&quot; and 245-B &quot;Letter from Tina,&quot; circa 1970.

<doc id="838619" wikidata="Q952483" url="?curid=838619" title="Connemara">
<text>Connemara ( ; ) is a region on the Atlantic coast of western County Galway, in the west of Ireland. The area has a strong association with traditional Irish culture and contains much of the Connacht Irish-speaking Gaeltacht, which is a key part of the identity of the region and is the largest Gaeltacht in the country. Historically, Connemara was part of the territory of Iar Connacht (West Connacht). Geographically, it has many mountains (notably the Twelve Pins), peninsulas, coves, islands and small lakes. Connemara National Park is in the northwest. It is mostly rural and its largest settlement is Clifden.

==Etymology==

&quot;Connemara&quot; derives from the tribal name , which designated a branch of the , an early tribal grouping that had a number of branches located in different parts of . Since this particular branch of the lived by the sea, they became known as the (sea in Irish is , genitive , hence &quot;of the sea&quot;).

==Definition==
One common definition of the area is that it consists of most of west Galway, that is to say the part of the county west of Lough Corrib and Galway city, contained by Killary Harbour, Galway Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Some more restrictive definitions of Connemara define it as the historical territory of , i.e. just the far northwest of County Galway, bordering County Mayo. The name is also used to describe the (Irish-speaking areas) of western County Galway, though it is argued that this too is inaccurate as some of these areas lie outside of the traditional boundary of Connemara. There are arguments about where Connemara ends as it approaches Galway city, which is definitely not in Connemara – some argue for Barna, on the outskirts of Galway City, some for a line from Oughterard to Maam Cross, and then diagonally down to the coast, all within rural lands.

The wider area of what is today known as Connemara was previously a sovereign kingdom known as , under the kingship of the , until it became part of the English-administered Kingdom of Ireland in the 16th century.

==History==
The main town of Connemara is Clifden, which is surrounded by an area rich with megalithic tombs.

The famous &quot;Connemara Green marble&quot; is found outcropping along a line between Streamstown and Lissoughter. It was a trade treasure used by the inhabitants in prehistoric times. It continues to be of great value today. It is available in large dimensional slabs suitable for buildings as well as for smaller pieces of jewellery.

===Clan system===

Before the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests, Connemara, like the rest of Gaelic Ireland, was ruled by Irish clans whose Chiefs and their derbhfine were expected to follow the same code of honour also expected of Scottish clan chiefs.

In his biography of Rob Roy MacGregor, W.H. Murray described the code of honour as follows, &quot;The abiding principle is cast up from the records of detail: that right must be seen to be done, no man left destitute, the given word honoured, the strictest honour observed to all who have given implicit trust, and that a guest&#x27;s confidence in his safety must never be betrayed by his host, or &quot;vice versa&quot;. There was more of like kind, and each held as its kernel the simple ideal of trust honoured... Breaches of it were abhorred and damned... The ideal was applied &#x27;with discretion&#x27;. Its interpretation went deeply into domestic life, but stayed shallow for war and politics.&quot;

The east of what is now Connemara was once called , and was ruled by Kings who claimed descent from the Delbhna and Dál gCais of Thomond and kinship with King Brian Boru. The Kings of Delbhna Tír Dhá Locha eventually took the title and surname Mac Con Raoi (since anglicised as Conroy or King).

The Chief of the Name of Clan Mac Con Raoi directly ruled as Lord of Gnó Mhór, which was later divided into the civil parishes of Kilcummin and Killannin. As was common practice at the time, due to the power they wielded through their war galleys, the Chiefs of Clan Mac Conraoi also fulfilled their duty to be providers for their clan members by demanding and receiving black rent on pain of piracy against ships who fished or traded within the Clan&#x27;s territory. The Chiefs of Clan Mac Conraoi were accordingly numbered, along with the Chiefs of Clans O&#x27;Malley, O&#x27;Dowd, and O&#x27;Flaherty, among &quot;the Sea Kings of Connacht&quot;. The nearby kingdom of Gnó Beag was ruled by the Chief of the Name of Clan Ó hÉanaí (usually anglicised as Heaney or Heeney).

The (Kealy) clan were the rulers of West Connemara. Like the Chiefs of Clan clan, the Chiefs of Clan (Conneely) also claimed descent from the .

During the early 13th century, but all four clans were displaced and subjugated by the Chiefs of Clan , who had been driven west from into by the Mac William Uachtar branch of the House of Burgh, during the Hiberno-Norman invasion of .

According to Irish–American historian Bridget Connelly, &quot;By the thirteenth century, the original inhabitants, the clans Conneely, Ó Cadhain, Ó Folan, and MacConroy, had been steadily driven westward from the Moycullen area to the seacoast between Moyrus and the Killaries. And by 1586, with the signing of the Articles of the Composition of Connacht that made Morrough O&#x27;Flaherty landlord over all in the name of Queen Elizabeth I, the MacConneelys and Ó Folans had sunk beneath the list of chieftains whose names appeared on the document. The Articles deprived all the original Irish clan chieftains not only of their title but also all of the rents, dues, and tribal rights they had possessed under Irish law.&quot;

During the 16th century, but legendary local pirate queen Grace O&#x27;Malley is on record as having said, with regard to her followers, () (&quot;Better a ship filled with MacConroy and MacAnally clansmen, than a ship filled with gold&quot;).

Even though she has traditionally been viewed as a icon of Irish nationalism, Grace O&#x27;Malley, in reality, sided with Queen Elizabeth I against Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell and Aodh Mór Ó Néill during the Nine Years War, after which her known descendants became completely assimilated into the British upper class. Even though O&#x27;Donnell and O&#x27;Neill were seeking primarily to end the religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Ireland by the English Queen her officials, O&#x27;Malley almost certainly considered herself completely justified under the code of conduct in siding with the Crown of England against them.

The feud began in 1595, when O&#x27;Donnell re-instated the Chiefdom of Clan MacWilliam Íochdar of the completely Gaelicised House of Burgh in County Mayo, which had been abolished under the policy of surrender and regrant. Instead, however, of allowing Clan a Burc to summon a gathering at which the nobles and commons would debate and then choose one of the derbhfine of the last chief to lead them, O&#x27;Donnell instead chose to appoint his ally Tiobóid mac Walter Ciotach Búrca as Chief of the Name. By passing over the claim of her son Tiobóid na Long Búrca to the Chiefdom, O&#x27;Donnell made himself a permanent and very dangerous enemy out of his mother&#x27;s former ally; Grace O&#x27;Malley. The latter was swift to retaliate by launching an English-backed regime change war, in which she fought against Hugh Roe in order to wrest the White Wand of the Chiefdom away from Tiobóid Mac Walter Ciotach and give it to her son. She was joined in this by the Clan O&#x27;Flaherty and the Irish clans of Connemara who followed their mantle.

Irish clan chief, historian, and refugee in Habsburg Spain Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare later went on the record as a very harsh critic of Niall Garbh O&#x27;Donnell, Tiobóid na Long Búrca, Grace O&#x27;Malley, and other members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland who similarly launched regime change wars within their clans with English backing. Having the benefit of hindsight regarding the long-term fallout from Tiobóid na Long Búrca&#x27;s uprising against his Chief and many others like it nationwide, O&#x27;Sullivan Beare wrote, &quot;The Catholics might have been able to find a remedy for all these evils, had it not been that they were destroyed from within by another and greater internal disease. For most of the families, clans, and towns of the Catholic chiefs, who took up arms in defense of the Catholic Faith, were divided into different factions, each having different leaders and following lords who were fighting for their estates and chieftaincies. The less powerful of them joined the English party in the hope of gaining the chieftainship of their clans, if the existing chieftains were removed from their position and property, and the English craftily held out that hope to them. Thus, short-sighted men, putting their private affairs before the public defence of their Holy Faith, turned their allies, followers, and towns from the Catholic chiefs and transferred to the English great resources, but in the end did not obtain what they wished for, but accomplished what they did not desire. For it was not they, but the English who got the properties of and rich patrimonies of the Catholic nobles and their kinsmen; and the Holy Faith of Christ Jesus, bereft of its defenders, lay open to the barbarous violence and lust of the heretics. There was one device by which the English were able to crush the forces of the Irish Chiefs, by promising their honours and revenues to such of their own kinsmen as would seduce their followers and allies from them, but when the war was over the English did not keep their promises.&quot;

===Religious persecution===
Before the Suppression of the Monasteries was spread to Connemara, the Dominican Order had a monastery about to the north of what is now Roundstone (). 

During the centuries of religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Ireland that began under Henry VIII and ended only with Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the Irish people, according to Marcus Tanner, clung to the Mass, &quot;crossed themselves when they passed Protestant ministers on the road, had to be dragged into Protestant churches and put cotton wool in their ears rather than listen to Protestant sermons.&quot; 

According to historian and folklorist Seumas MacManus, &quot;Throughout these dreadful centuries, too, the hunted priest -- who in his youth had been smuggled to the Continent of Europe to receive his training -- tended the flame of faith. He lurked like a thief among the hills. On Sundays and Feast Days he celebrated Mass at a rock, on a remote mountainside, while the congregation knelt on the heather of the hillside, under the open heavens. While he said Mass, faithful sentries watched from all the nearby hilltops, to give timely warning of the approaching priest-hunter and his guard of British soldiers. But sometimes the troops came on them unawares, and the Mass Rock was bespattered with his blood, -- and men, women, and children caught in the crime of worshipping God among the rocks, were frequently slaughtered on the mountainside.&quot;

According to historian and folklorist Tony Nugent, several Mass rocks survive in Connemara from this era. There is one located along the boreen named &quot;Baile Eamoinn&quot; near Spiddal. Two others are located at Barr na Daoire and at Caorán Beag in Carraroe. A fourth, Cluain Duibh, is located near Moycullen at Clooniff. The cartographer Tim Robinson has written of a fifth Mass rock, located in the Townland of &quot;An Tulaigh&quot;, which also includes two holy wells and, formerly, a Christian pilgrimage chapel dedicated to St. Columkille, who is said in the oral tradition to have visited the region. The Mass rock was built from several of the many boulders scattered by glaciers around Lough Clurra and is named in Irish &quot;Cloch an tSagairt&quot; (&quot;Stone of the Priest&quot;), but which was formerly marked as &quot;Druid&#x27;s altar&quot; and dolmen on the old Ordnance Survey maps.

After taking the island in 1653, the New Model Army of Oliver Cromwell turned the nearby island of Inishbofin, County Galway, into a prison camp for Roman Catholic priests arrested while exercising their religious ministry covertly in other parts of Ireland. Inishmore, in the nearby Aran Islands, was used for exactly the same purpose. The last priests held on both islands were finally released following the Stuart Restoration in 1662.

One of the last Chiefs of Clan O&#x27;Flaherty and Lord of Iar Connacht was the 17th-century historian Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh, who lost the greater part of his ancestral lands during the Cromwellian confiscations of the 1650s.

After being dispossessed, Ó Flaithbheartaigh settled near Spiddal wrote a book of Irish history in Neo-Latin titled &quot;Ogygia&quot;, which was published in 1685 as &quot;Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia &amp; etc.&quot;, in 1793 it was translated into English by Rev. James Hely, as &quot;Ogygia, or a Chronological account of Irish Events (collected from Very Ancient Documents faithfully compared with each other &amp; supported by the Genealogical &amp; Chronological Aid of the Sacred and Profane Writings of the Globe)&quot;. Ogygia, the island of Calypso in Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, was used by Ó Flaithbheartaigh as a poetic allegory for Ireland. Drawing from numerous ancient documents, &quot;Ogygia&quot; traces Irish history back before Saint Patrick and into Pre-Christian Irish mythology.

Simultaneously, however, Máirtín Mór Ó Máille, who claimed descent from the derbhfine of the last Chief of the Name of the Clan O&#x27;Malley and Lord of Umhaill as well as kinship with the famous pirate queen Grace O&#x27;Malley, ran much of Anglo-Irish landlord Richard &quot;Humanity Dick&quot; Martin&#x27;s estates from his residence at &quot;Keeraun House&quot; and the surrounding region, which are still known locally as &quot;the demesne&quot; (), as a &quot;middleman&quot; ().

From the rock known as &quot;O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Seat () at the mouth of the creek known as &quot;An Dólain&quot; near the village of An Caorán Beag in Carraroe, Ó Máille also ran, with the enthusiastic collusion of his employer, one of the busiest smuggling operations in South Connemara and regularly unloaded cargoes smuggled in from Guernsey. Like many other members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland before him, Ó Máille was a legendary figure even in his own lifetime, entertaining all guests with several barrels of wine and feasts of roasted sheep and cattle, which were always fully eaten before having to be salted.

This arrangement continued until around 1800. While hosting Rt.-Rev. Edmund Ffrench, the Dominican Warden of Galway and future Roman Catholic Bishop of Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora, however, Máirtín Mór Ó Máille presided over an accidental breach of hospitality. As Warden Ffrench&#x27;s visit was on a Friday, the Friar&#x27;s was only eating fish and seafood. When one of the household servants of Máirtín Mór accidentally poured a meat gravy upon his plate, the future Bishop understood that it was unintentional and graciously waved the plate away. The future Bishop&#x27;s cousin, Thomas Ffrench, however, was less forgiving and demanded satisfaction. This resulted in a duel during which Máirtín Mór was mortally wounded.

Sir Richard Martin, who had not been in Connemara at the time, was shocked and angry to hear of his middleman&#x27;s death, saying, &quot;Ó Máille preferred a hole in his guts to one in his honour, but there wouldn&#x27;t have been a hole in either if I&#x27;d been told of it!&quot;

Meanwhile another branch of the Gaelic nobility, who claimed descent from the derbhfine of the last O&#x27;Flaherty Chiefs, similarly lived in a thatch-covered long house at Renvyle and acted as both clan leaders and &quot;middlemen&quot; for the Anglo-Irish Blake family of Galway City, who were granted much of the region under the Acts of Settlement in 1677. This arrangement continued until 1811, when Henry Blake ended a 130-year-long tradition of his family acting as absentee landlords and evicted 86-year-old Anthony O&#x27;Flaherty, his relatives, and his retainers. Henry Blake then demolished Anthony O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s longhouse and built Renvyle House on the site.

===Direct British rule===
Even though Henry Blake later termed the eviction of Anthony O&#x27;Flaherty in &quot;Letters from the Irish Highlands&quot;, as &quot;the dawn of law in Cunnemara&quot; (sic), the Anglo-Irish Blake family, who remained in the region until the 1920s, are recalled in Connemara, as, &quot;famously bad landlords&quot; with an alleged sense of sexual entitlement regarding the female tenants on their estates and as enthusiastic supporters of the anti-Catholic activities of the local Irish Church Missions, which, &quot;caused much unrest and bitterness&quot;.

Local Irish folklore accordingly glorifies a local rapparee known as Scorach Ghlionnáin, who was allegedly born illegitimately in a seaside cave in the Townland of An Tulaigh. He is said to often and successfully have stolen from the Blake family and their land agents and given to the poor, until enlisting in the British Army and losing his life in the Crimean War. The Blake family are also said in the local oral tradition to have been permanently banished from the region by a curse put on them by a local Roman Catholic priest who dabbled in Pre-Christian sorcery. Elsewhere in Connemara, Anglo-Irish landlord John D&#x27;Arcy (1785-1839), who bankrupted both himself and his heirs to found the town of Clifden, is recalled much more fondly.
In 1843, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, the mastermind of the successful campaign for Catholic Emancipation, held a &#x27;Monster Meeting&#x27; at Clifden, attended by a crowd reportedly numbering 100,000, before whom he spoke on repeal of the Act of Union.

Connemara was drastically depopulated during the Great Famine in the late 1840s, with the lands of the Anglo-Irish Martin family being greatly affected and the bankrupted landlord being forced to auction off the estate in 1849:

The Sean nós song &quot;Johnny Seoighe&quot; is one of the few Irish songs from the era of the Great Famine that still survives. The events of the Great Irish Famine in Connemara have since inspired the recent Irish-language films &quot;Black &#x27;47&quot;, directed by Lance Daly, and &quot;Arracht&quot;, which was directed by Tomás Ó Súilleabháin.

The Irish Famine of 1879 similarly caused mass starvation, evictions, and violence in Connemara against the abuses of power by local Anglo-Irish landlords, bailiffs, and the Royal Irish Constabulary.

According to Tim Robinson, &quot;Michael Davitt, founder of the Land League... visited An Cheathrú Rua [in 1879] and... found that the tenantry was reduced to eating the seed-potatoes on which the next seasons crop depended. In January 1880 after another tour of Connemara, he reported that the Poor Law Unions of the coastal areas were providing no outdoor relief (i.e. road-building schemes, etc.), and that the people faced starvation in the months before the summer. Not only was potato-blight prevalent, but it seems the kelp market had failed, and for most small tenants of the coastal areas it was the price they got for their kelp that paid the rent.&quot;

In response, Father Patrick Grealy, the Roman Catholic priest assigned to Carna, selected ten, &quot;very destitute but industrious and virtuous families&quot;, from his parish to emigrate to America and be settled upon frontier homesteads in Moonshine Township, near Graceville, Minnesota, by Bishop John Ireland of the Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Paul.

In 1880 efforts by landlord Martin S. Kirwan to evict his starving tenants resulted in &quot;The Battle of Carraroe&quot; (), which Tim Robinson has dubbed, &quot;the most dramatic event of the Land War in Connemara.&quot; During the famous battle, Mr. Fenton, the landlord&#x27;s process server, arrived to serve evictions with the protection and support of an estimated 260 officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary. They were met by the violent resistance of an estimated 2000 members of the local population. Tim Robinson writes, &quot;Local &quot;Seanchas&quot; has it that there were many unfamiliar faces in the crowd – the dead, come up from the Old graveyard at Barr an Doire to protect the homes of their descendants, it was said.&quot; () After escalating violence forced him to retreat to the RIC barracks before completing the third eviction, Mr. Fenton wrote a letter to the land agent at Roundstone (); announcing his refusal to serve more evictions.

According to historian Cormac Ó Comhraí, between the Land War and the First World War, politics in Connemara was largely dominated by the pro-Home Rule Irish Parliamentary Party and its ally, the United Irish League. At the same time, though, despite an almost complete absence of the Sinn Fein political party in Connemara, the militantly anti-monarchist Irish Republican Brotherhood had a number of active units throughout the region. Furthermore, many County Galway veterans of the subsequent Irish War of Independence traced their belief in Irish republicanism to a father or grandfather who had been in the IRB.

The first transatlantic flight, piloted by British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown, landed in a boggy area near Clifden in 1919.

===War of Independence===
At the beginning of the Irish War of Independence, the IRA in Connemara had active service companies in Shanafaraghaun, Maam, Kilmilkin, Cornamona, Clonbur, Carraroe, Lettermore, Gorumna, Rosmuc, Letterfrack, and Renvyle. The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), on the other hand, was based at fortified barracks at Clifden, Letterfrack, Leenane, Clonbur, Rosmuc, and Maam.

IRA veteran Jack Feehan later recalled of the region at the outbreak of the conflict, &quot;In South Connemara from Spiddal to Lettermullen the brewing (of poitín) was very strong and it went out as far as Carna. The people there were against the RIC more or less because they used to search for poitín, save in the Leenane area where the tourists came and Clifden were there were tourists and people who wanted to be friendly to law and good money.&quot;

According to both historian Kathleen Villiers-Tuthill and former West Connemara Brigade IRA O/C Peter J. McDonnell, one of the IRA&#x27;s most valuable intelligence officers during the ensuing conflict was Letterfrack native Jack Conneely, who had served as a Sergeant in the Royal Engineers during the First World War. Following the Armistice, Conneely had returned to Connemara and accepted a position as the driver for the Leenane Hotel. Due to his war record, Conneely was trusted completely by oblivious Special Constables of the Black and Tans. Crown security forces often requested rides from Conneely, who covertly used the opportunity to ask questions about secret military operations during the drive. On one occasion, two Special Constables accepted a ride to Leenane from Conneely without realizing that they were sitting the whole time next to crates filled with guns and ammunition. After dropping both men off, Conneely delivered the arms shipment to a safe house along Killary Harbour, where the arms were picked up and carried by sea to the IRA in County Mayo.

But the national leadership of the Irish Volunteers was so dissatisfied by the inefficiency and internal squabbling of the IRA in Connemara that, in September 1920, Brigade Commandant Peter McDonnell was summoned to a secret meeting at Kilmilkin with IRA Chief of Staff Richard Mulcahy, who promoted MacDonnell on the spot to Officer Commanding of the West Connemara Brigade.

====Burning of Clifden====
The assassination of 14 British Intelligence officers from the Cairo Gang in Dublin on Bloody Sunday, was followed by the arrest and court-martial of Connemara-native Thomas Whelan for high treason and the first degree murder of Captain B.T. Baggelly at 119 Lower Baggot Street. Whelan, however, was a Volunteer in the IRA&#x27;s Dublin Brigade but was not involved with Michael Collins&#x27; Squad, which had carried out the assassinations that morning. Therefore, in a break from typical IRA practice in such trials, Whelan recognized the court, pled not guilty, and accepted the services of a defense attorney, who introduced the sworn testimony of multiple alibi witnesses who stated that Whelan had attended a late morning Mass and had been seen to receive Holy Communion in Ringsend on Bloody Sunday. Despite this testimony and the efforts of the Archbishop of Dublin and of Monsignor Joseph MacAlpine, the parish priest of St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Clifden and Irish Parliamentary Party political boss of the surrounding region, to save his life out of a firm believe that he had not been involved in Captain Baggelly&#x27;s assassination, Whelan was found guilty and subjected to execution by hanging on 14 March 1921.

In retaliation, Peter J. McDonnell and the West Connemara Brigade decided to follow the IRA&#x27;s &quot;Two for One&quot; policy by assassinating two Royal Irish Constabulary officers in Whelan&#x27;s birthplace of Clifden, which until then had been, according to Rosmuc IRA commander Colm Ó Gaora, &quot;gach uile lá riamh dílis do dhlí Shasana&quot;, (&quot;ever single day that ever was, loyal to England&#x27;s law&quot;).

According to Peter McDonnell, the night of 15 March 1921 was selected, &quot;to go into Clifden, get grub, and have a crack at the patrol.&quot; At the time, between 18 and 20 policemen were always stationed in the town. After finding the police had returned to barracks, the IRA withdrew temporarily, spent the night at, &quot;the little lodge of Jim King near Kilcock&quot; (sic), and, on the evening of 16 March 1921, the patrol reentered Clifden from the south. A party of six IRA men then approached RIC Constables Charles Reynolds and Thomas Sweeney near &quot;Eddie King&#x27;s Pub&quot;. McDonnell later recalled, &quot;I saw two RIC against Eddie King&#x27;s window and they noticed us. One of them made a dive for his gun as I passed and we wheeled and opened up. They were shot.&quot; As both officers lay dying, the IRA men were seen to bend over them and remove their weapons and ammunition, before withdrawing from the scene with other RIC Constables in pursuit.

Peter Joseph McDonnell later recalled, &quot;They had a rifle and a revolver, fifty rounds of ammo, and belts and pouches.&quot; Canon Joseph MacAlpine was immediately summoned and gave both Constables the Last Rites before their deaths.

Believing that an attack on their barracks was imminent, the Clifden RIC sent out a request for assistance over Clifden&#x27;s Trans-Atlantic Marconi wireless station. In a British war crime that is still known as &quot;The Burning of Clifden&quot; and in response to the request, a trainload of &quot;Special Constables&quot; from the Black and Tans arrived via the Galway to Clifden railway in the early hours of St Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1921. While making a half-hearted search for Sinn Féin supporters, the Tans committed arson and burned down fourteen houses and businesses. Other Clifden residents later testified about being beaten and robbed at gunpoint and were granted compensation by the courts. John J. McDonnell, a decorated former sergeant major in the Connaught Rangers during World War I, was shot dead by security forces; most likely for the incorrigibly bad luck of having the same surname as the O.C. of the IRA West Connemara Brigade. Local businessman Peter Clancy was shot in the face and neck, but survived. Before leaving the town, British security forces left graffiti outside Eddie King&#x27;s pub, &quot;Clifden will remember and so will the RIC&quot;, as well as, &quot;Shoot another member of the RIC and up goes the town&quot;.

====The Kilmilkin ambush====
In the Irish folklore of Connemara, it was often said that one of last battles in a successful struggle for Irish independence would be fought in the hills near Kilmilkin. The IRA West Connemara Brigade&#x27;s ambush of a Royal Irish Constabulary convoy on 21 April 1921 was later seen as the fulfilment of that legend.

===Irish Civil War===
====The Truce====
Shortly after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921, Connaught IRA commanders Peter J. McDonnell, Jack Feehan, and Michael Kilroy had a meeting with Michael Collins at the Gaelic League headquarters. McDonnell later recalled, &quot;There was a conference on and he (Collins) had arranged to meet us. Jack had been in Dublin as he was the Divisional Quartermaster and he told us why we should accept the Treaty for we out of ammunition and the only choice we had was to accept the Treaty. All he wanted himself, Collins said, was to accept the Treaty for six months, get in arms, and then we could tell the British to go to blazes. We couldn&#x27;t carry on the fight for we had no hope of carrying it out successfully. I represented West Connemara, was Brigade O/C and Deputy O/C of the Division; Jack Feehan was Divisional Quartermaster; Michael Kilroy, O/C Western Division there. We told Collins we didn&#x27;t agree with what he said and he didn&#x27;t say much.&quot;

In the lead up to the Irish Civil War, Pro-Treaty rallies were held in Clifden, Roundstone, and Cashel, while a massive anti-Treaty rally was addressed by Eamon de Valera at Market Square in Oughterard on 23 April 1922.

Following the anti-Treaty IRA&#x27;s occupation of the Four Courts in Dublin on 13 April, 1922, however, local anti-Treaty IRA units took action to raise money by simultaneous armed robbery of the post offices in Ballyconneely, Clifden, and Cleggan on Good Friday. Furthermore, after Anglo-Irish landlord Talbott Clifton fled the country following a gun battles against local anti-Treaty IRA members, his home at Kylemore House was requisitioned and barricaded against expected attack by soldiers from the newly founded Irish Army. Mark O&#x27;Malley later recalled that he deeply regretted that the anti-Treaty IRA never found Mr. Clifton&#x27;s supply of guns and ammunition, which were widely believed to be hidden nearby.

====Hostilities====
Renvyle House was burned down by the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, but later rebuilt by Oliver St John Gogarty and turned into a hotel.

==Geography==

Connemara lies in the territory of , &quot;West Connacht,&quot; within the portion of County Galway west of Lough Corrib, and was traditionally divided into North Connemara and South Connemara. The mountains of the Twelve Bens and the Owenglin River, which flows into the sea at / Clifden, marked the boundary between the two parts. Connemara is bounded on the west, south and north by the Atlantic Ocean. In at least some definitions, Connemara&#x27;s land boundary with the rest of County Galway is marked by the Invermore River otherwise known as (which flows into the north of Kilkieran Bay), Loch Oorid (which lies a few kilometres west of Maam Cross) and the western spine of the Maumturks mountains. In the north of the mountains, the boundary meets the sea at Killary, a few kilometres west of Leenaun.

The coast of Connemara is made up of multiple peninsulas. The peninsula of (sometimes corrupted to ) in the south is the largest and contains the villages of Carna and Kilkieran. The peninsula of Errismore consists of the area west of the village of Ballyconneely. Errisbeg peninsula lies to the south of the village of Roundstone. The Errislannan peninsula lies just south of the town of Clifden. The peninsulas of Kingstown, Coolacloy, Aughrus, Cleggan and Renvyle are found in Connemara&#x27;s north-west. Connemara includes numerous islands, the largest of which is Inis mór which is the biggest island, County Galway Inis mór; other islands include Omey, Inishark, High Island, Friars Island, Feenish and Maínis.

The territory contains the civil parishes of Moyrus, Ballynakill, Omey, Ballindoon and Inishbofin (the last parish was for a time part of the territory of the , the O Malley Lords of Umhaill, County Mayo), and the Roman Catholic parishes of Carna, Clifden (Omey and Ballindoon), Ballynakill, Kilcumin (Oughterard and Rosscahill), Roundstone and Inishbofin.

==Irish language, literature, and folklore==

The population of Connemara is 32,000. There are between 20,000–24,000 native Irish speakers in the region, making it the largest Irish-speaking . The Enumeration Districts with the most Irish speakers in all of Ireland, as a percentage of population, can be seen in the South Connemara area. Those of school age (5–19 years old) are the most likely to be identified as speakers.

Writing in 1994, John Ardagh described &quot;the Galway Gaeltacht&quot; of South Connemara, as a region, &quot;where narrow bumpy roads lead from one little whitewashed village to another, through a rough landscape of green hills, bogs, and little lakes, past a straggling coast of deep inlets and tiny rocky islands.&quot; Due the many close similarities between the landscape, language, history, and culture of West County Galway with those of the Gàidhealtachd of Scotland, the Connemara Gaeltacht during the Victorian era was often called &quot;The Irish Highlands&quot;. Connemara has accordingly wielded an enormous influence upon Irish culture, literature, mythology, and folklore.

Micheál Mac Suibhne (), a Connacht Irish bard mainly associated with Cleggan, remains a locally revered figure, due to his genius level contribution to oral poetry, Modern literature in Irish, and sean-nós singing in Connacht Irish. Mac Suibhne was born near the ruined Abbey of Cong, then part of County Galway, but now in County Mayo. The names of his parents are not recorded, but his ancestors are said to have migrated from Ulster as refugees from the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

He spent most of his life in Connemara and is said to have been a heavy drinker. Micheál Mac Suibhne and his brother Toirdhealbhach are said to have moved to the civil parish of Ballinakill, between Letterfrack and Clifden, where the poet was employed as a blacksmith by an Anglo-Irish landlord named Steward. It is not known whether Mac Suibhne ever married, but he is believed to have died in poverty at Fahy, near Clifden, around the year 1820. His burial place, however, remains unknown.

In 1846, James Hardiman wrote of Micheál Mac Suibhne: &quot;By the English-speaking portion of the people, Mac Sweeney was the &#x27;Bard of the West.&#x27; He composed, in his native language, several poems and songs of considerable merit; which have become such favourites, that there are few who cannot repeat some of them from memory. Many of these have been collected by the Editor; and if space shall permit, one or more of the most popular will be inserted in the Additional Notes, as a specimen of modern Irish versification, and of those compositions which afford so much social pleasure to the good people of Iar-Connacht.&quot; In his &quot;Additional Notes to &quot;Iar or West Connacht&quot;&quot; (1846), Hardiman published the full texts of &quot;Abhrán an Phúca&quot;, the &quot;Banais Pheigi Ní Eaghra&quot; (commonly known under the English title &quot;The Connemara Wedding&quot;), and &quot;Eóghain Cóir&quot; (lit. &quot;Honest Owen&quot;), a mock-lament over the recent death of a notoriously corrupt and widely disliked land agent. Following the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War, Professor Tomás Ó Máille collected from the local oral tradition, edited, and published all of Micheál Mac Suibhne&#x27;s poems in 1934.

After emigrating from Connemara to the United States during the 1860s, Bríd Ní Mháille, a Bard in the Irish language outside Ireland and sean-nós singer from the village of Trá Bhán, Isle of Garmna, composed the &quot;caoine&quot; &quot; Amhrán na Trá Báine&quot;. The song is about the drowning of her three brothers after their &quot;currach&quot; was rammed and sunk while they were out at sea. Ní Mháille&#x27;s lament for her brothers was first performed at a ceilidh in South Boston, Massachusetts before being brought back to Connemara, where it is considered an &quot;Amhrán Mór&quot; (&quot;Big Song&quot;) and remains a very popular song among both performers and fans of both sean-nós singing and Irish traditional music.

During the Gaelic revival, Irish teacher and nationalist Patrick Pearse, who would go on to lead the 1916 Easter Rising before being executed by firing squad, owned a cottage at Rosmuc, where he spent his summers learning the Irish language and writing. According to &quot;Innti&quot; poet and literary critic Louis de Paor, despite Pearse&#x27;s enthusiasm for the &quot;Conamara Theas&quot; dialect of Connacht Irish spoken around his summer cottage, he chose to follow the usual practice of the Gaelic revival by writing in Munster Irish, which was considered less Anglicized than other Irish dialects. At the same time, however, Pearse&#x27;s reading of the radically experimental poetry of Walt Whitman and of the French Symbolists led him to introduce Modernist poetry into the Irish language. As a literary critic, Pearse also left behind a very detailed blueprint for the decolonization of Irish literature, particularly in the Irish language.

During the aftermath of the Irish War of Independence and the Civil War, Connemara was a major center for the work of the Irish Folklore Commission in recording Ireland&#x27;s endangered folklore, mythology, and oral literature. According to folklore collector and archivist Seán Ó Súilleabháin, residents with no stories to tell were the exception rather than the rule and it was generally conceded in 1935 that there were more unrecorded folktales in the parish of Carna alone than anywhere else in Western Europe.

One of the most important tradition bearers the Commission recorded in Connemara or anywhere else was Éamon a Búrc. Before his repertoire of tales was recorded and transcribed, a Búrc had emigrated to America and lived in Graceville, Minnesota and in the Connemara Patch shantytown in the Twin Cities while working for the Great Northern Railway of James J. Hill. After returning lamed to his native Carna, Éamon a Búrc became a tailor and was recorded by Séamus Ó Duilearga and Liam MacCoisdeala in 1935 at the home now owned the Ó Cuaig family. According to folklorist Seán Ó Súilleabháin, &quot;Éamonn a Búrc was possibly the most accomplished narrator of folktales who has lived into our time. His artistry is at once evident in any of the tales which fill the two thousand pages of manuscript recorded from him by Mac Coisdeala. One of his hero tales, &quot;Eochair, mac Rí in Éirinn&quot;, recorded in October 1938, filled twenty-two Ediphone cylinders, that is, over 26,000 words.&quot; Furthermore, according to Irish-American historian Bridget Connelly, the stories collected in Irish from Éamon a Búrc are still taught in University courses alongside &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the Elder Edda and the Homeric Hymns.

Joe Heaney a legendary seanchai and sean-nós singer in Connacht Irish, is said to have known more than 500 songs – most learned from his family while he was growing up in Carna. 

After hearing Heaney’s first public performance in Dublin of a famous work of Christian poetry about the Crucifixion of Jesus from the Connemara oral tradition, Máirtín Ó Cadhain wrote, &quot;In &quot;Caoineadh na dtrí Muire&quot; he brings home to us the joys and sorrows of Mary with the intimacy and poignancy of a Fra Angelico painting.&quot;

The Féile Chomórtha Joe Éinniú (Joe Heaney Commemorative Festival) is held every year in Carna.

Sorcha Ní Ghuairim, a Sean-nós singer and writer of Modern literature in Irish, was also born in Connemara. Initially a newspaper columnist termed ‘Coisín Siúlach’ for the newspaper &quot;The Irish Press&quot;, where she eventually became the editor. She also wrote a regular column for the children&#x27;s page under the pen name ‘Niamh Chinn Óir’. Her other writings included a series of children&#x27;s stories titled &quot;Eachtraí mhuintir Choinín&quot; and &quot;Sgéal Taimín Mhic Luiche&quot;. With the assistance of Pádraig Ó Concheanainn, Sorcha also translated Charles McGuinness&#x27; &quot;Viva Irlanda&quot; for publication in the newspaper. Their translation was subsequently published under the title &quot;Ceathrar comrádaí&quot; in 1943.

While living at Inverin, Connemara during the Emergency, however, Calum Maclean, the brother of highly important Scottish Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean, was appointed by Professor Séamus Ó Duilearga (1899–1980) as a part-time collector for the Irish Folklore Commission (&quot;Coimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann&quot;). From August 1942 to February 1945, Maclean sent a considerable amount of lore in the local Conamara Theas dialect of Connaught Irish to the Commission, amounting to six bound volumes. From March 1945 Maclean was employed as a temporary cataloguer by the Commission in Dublin, before being sent to the Scottish Gàidhealtachd to collect folklore there as well, first for the Irish Folklore Commission and later for the School of Scottish Studies.

While interned during the Second World War in the Curragh Camp by Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, a Post-Civil War IRA member from An Spidéal, became one of the most radically innovative writers of Modern literature in Irish by writing the comic and modernist literary classic &quot;Cré na Cille&quot;.

The novel is written almost entirely as conversation between the dead bodies buried underneath a Connemara cemetery. In a departure from Patrick Pearse&#x27;s idealization of the un-Anglicised Irish culture of the Gaeltachtaí, the deceased speakers in &quot;Cré na Cille&quot; spend the whole novel continuing the quarrels from when they were still alive: gossiping, backbiting, flirting, feuding, and scandal-mongering.

According to William Brennan, the manuscript for &quot;Cré na Cille&quot; was turned town by the first publisher to whom it was submitted, allegedly for being too reminiscent of the bawdy writings of James Joyce. Máirtín Ó Cadhain, however, was not put off. &quot;In 1949&quot;, according to Brennan, &quot;the &quot;Irish Press&quot; serialized it nationally over seven months, and the following year, the boutique publisher &quot;Sáirséal agus Dill&quot; released a bound version. The book became the talk of the Irish-speaking world. Young Irish speakers read it aloud to their illiterate grandparents — in Galway, according to one writer, college students passed the thrice-weekly &quot;Irish Press&quot; installments from hand to hand, and scrounged to buy the book when it appeared in stores.&quot;

&quot;Cré na Cille&quot; is widely considered a masterpiece of 20th-century Irish literature and has drawn comparisons to the writings of Flann O’Brien, Samuel Beckett and James Joyce.

Through &quot;Cré na Cille&quot; and his other writings, Máirtín Ó Cadhain became a major part of the revival of literary modernism in Irish, where it had been largely dormant since the execution of Patrick Pearse in 1916. Ó Cadhain created a literary language for his writing out of the Conamara Theas and Cois Fharraige dialects of Connacht Irish, but he was often accused of an unnecessarily dialectal usage in grammar and orthography even in contexts where realistic depiction of the Connemara vernacular was not called for. He was also happy to experiment with borrowings from other dialects, Classical Irish and even Scottish Gaelic. Consequently, much of what Ó Cadhain wrote is, like the poetry of fellow Linguistic experimentalist Liam S. Gógan, reputedly very hard to understand for a non-native speaker.

In addition to his writings, Máirtín Ó Cadhain was also instrumental in preaching what he called &quot;Athghabháil na hÉireann&quot; (&quot;Re-Conquest of Ireland&quot;), (meaning both decolonization and re-Gaelicisation). In an interview before his death, Ó Cadhain said, &quot;If we lose the Irish language, we lose our native literature, we’ll be finished as a people. The vision that every generation of Irish people had will be at an end.&quot;

With this in mind, Ó Cadhain spearheaded the 1969 founding of Coiste Cearta Síbialta na Gaeilge (English: Irish Language Civil Rights Committee&quot;), a pressure group campaigning for social, economic and cultural rights for native-speakers of the Irish-language both inside and outside of traditional Gaeltacht areas and which repeatedly emulated the direct action and civil disobedience tactics used by the contemporary Welsh Language Society, the Northern Ireland civil rights movement, and the American civil rights movement.

One of their most successful protests involved the pirate radio station Saor Raidió Chonamara (Free Radio Connemara) which first came on the air during Oireachtas na Gaeilge 1968, as a direct challenge to both the Irish government&#x27;s monopoly over the airwaves and, far more importantly, their deliberate inaction regarding Irish language broadcasting. The station used a medium wave transmitter smuggled in from the Netherlands. The Irish government responded by proposing a national Irish-language radio station RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta which came on the air on Easter Sunday 1972. Its headquarters are now in Casla.

In 1974, Gluaiseacht also persuaded Conradh na Gaeilge to end the practice since 1939 of always holding Oireachtas na Gaeilge, a cultural and literary festival modeled after the Welsh Eisteddfod, in Dublin rather than in the Gaeltacht areas. Gluaisceart also successfully secured recognition of sean-nós dance in 1977.

While employed as a Navvy, or construction worker, in 1950s England and rebuilding the cities of Northampton, Coventry, and London, following the destruction of The Blitz, Dónall Mac Amhlaigh, a native of Barna, kept an Irish-language diary describing days spent at manual labour followed by nights of Ceilidh dances and Sean-nos songs in the pubs, which he later published in 1960 as, &quot;Dialann Deoraí&quot;. It was translated into English by Valentine Iremonger and published in 1964 under the title &quot;An Irish Navvy: The Diary of an Exile&quot;.

Another figure important to Modern literature in Irish to come out of Connemara was Casla-born poet, actress, Irish-language activist, and Sean nós singer Caitlín Maude (1941-1982). According to Louis de Paor, &quot;Although no collection of her work was published during her lifetime, Caitlín Maude had a considerable influence on Irish language poetry and poets, including Máirtín Ó Direáin, Micheál Ó hArtnéide, Tomás Mac Síomóin, and Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill. That influence is a measure of the dramatic force of her personality, her exemplary ingenuity and commitment to the language, and her ability as a singer to embody the emotional disturbance at the heart of a song. Her collected poems are relatively slight, including incomplete drafts and fragments, but reveal a poetic voice confident of its own authority, drawing on the spoken language of the Connemara Gaeltacht but rarely on its conventions of oral composition or, indeed, on precedents in Irish poetry in either language. The best of her work is closer to the American poetry of the 1960s in its use of looser forms that follow the rhythms of the spoken word and the sense of the poem as direct utterance without artifice, a technique requiring a high degree of linguistic precision and formal control.&quot;

Maude also led the successful Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta direct action campaign that forced the Irish State to open an experimental Irish-language immersion school, &quot;Scoil Santain&quot;, in the Dublin suburb of Tallaght. This experiment has been successfully duplicated in countless other English-speaking communities throughout Ireland, with an overwhelming record of success as a tool of language revival.

The Connaught Irish memoirs of Colm Ó Gaora, the former IRA company commander in Rosmuc during the Irish War of Independence, were published in 2008 under the title &quot;Mise&quot;. An English translation, under the title &quot;On the Run: The Story of an Irish Freedom Fighter&quot;, was published in Cork City by Mercier Press in 2011.

Recently, the Coláiste Lurgan, a language immersion summer college located at Inverin, has won worldwide acclaim for their Irish language covers of pop songs,including Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, Adele&#x27;s &quot;Hello&quot;, and Avicii&#x27;s &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;, on the TG Lurgan YouTube channel. The band Seo Linn is composed of musicians who met at the college.

Writing in 1994, John Ardagh recalled, &quot;One night I attended a Sean Nós festival in a crowded village pub in Carraroe – local people all talking Irish, singing in turn their solo ballads, semi-improvised, with strange, almost oriental rhythms. There were microphones, videos, and girls in jeans; yet in some ways it might have been a century ago. I felt in the presence of an alien culture, so different from the world of modern Dublin; and I asked myself whether &quot;this&quot; was the true Ireland, or something today irrelevant to it. I also felt sad that the English and Irish had long ago conspired to marginalize this beautiful Celtic language.&quot;

John Ardagh also conceded, though, that the &quot;Gaeilgeoir&quot; community of Galway City, which, &quot;today sees itself as the Gaelic capital of Ireland, and has been filling up with intellectual enthusiasts similar to those who have been leading the language revival in Dublin&quot;, benefits enormously from their proximity to the Connemara Gaeltacht. The &quot;Gaeilgeoirí&quot; of Galway City, where, &quot;Irish is often heard in the streets,&quot; and which, &quot;has a flourishing little Irish language theatre&quot;, often &quot;make pilgrimages&quot; to the rural Gaeltacht to, &quot;drink at the fountains of its culture&quot;, attend its summer cultural festivals, and further perfect their knowledge of the Irish language by conversing with native speakers.

From a literary perspective, one of the most important Galway City &quot;Gaeilgeoir&quot; activists is Irish language poet and William Shakespeare enthusiast Muiris Sionóid, who later recalled, &quot;It was during the following and final phase of my education at University College Galway, now NUIG, that I formed in-dissoluble friendships with a host of Irish speakers, mostly from Connemara and the Aran Islands, holidaying regularly with families there especially with that of my great friend, Michael Powell, of Eochaill, Inis Mór. During that period among those wonderfully hospitable and golden-hearted people Irish became by dint of constant loving use what I had always fervently wished it to be, my mind’s first language. Thereafter throughout my years as a teacher of Mathematics and the Sciences, and as husband and father, my love of poetry, in English and Irish and indeed in Latin and a number of other European languages, though never waning, could naturally find no outlet − until early retirement beckoned. No bard, Irish or English, had been found fit in all this while to dethrone the mighty songster of Avonside in my Kingdom of Poetry.&quot; In 2009, Sionóid published a translation of Shakespeare&#x27;s 154 sonnets into Connaught Irish under the title &quot;Rotha Mór an Ghrá&quot; (&quot;The Great Wheel of Love&quot;).

==Transport==
Connemara is accessible by the and City Link bus services. From 1895 to 1935 it was served by the Midland Great Western Railway branch that connected Galway City to Clifden.

The N59 is the main area road, following an inland route from Galway to Clifden. A popular alternative is the coastal route beginning with the R336 from Galway. This is also known as the Connemara Loop consisting of a 45 km drive where one can view the landscape and scenery of Connemara.

Aer Arann Islands serves the Aran Islands from Connemara Airport in the south of Connemara also known as .

<text>According to biblical sources, Cushan-rishathaim ( &quot;Kūšan Riš‘āṯayim&quot;, &quot;twice-evil Kushite&quot;) was king of Aram-Naharaim, or Northwest Mesopotamia, and the first oppressor of the Israelites after their settlement in Canaan. In the Book of Judges, God delivers the Israelites into his hand for eight years (:8) as a punishment for polytheism. However, when the people of Israel &quot;called to Jehovah&quot;, He saved them through Othniel, son of Kenaz (Judges 3:9).

Scholars have proposed several explanations for Biblical accounts related to this ruler.

&#x27;Cushan&#x27; or &#x27;Chushan&#x27; may indicate Cushite origins. &#x27;Rishathaim&#x27; means &#x27;double-wickedness&#x27;(&quot;resha&quot; רשע - &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;wickedness&quot; + &quot;im&quot; יים - doubling suffix). The latter was most likely a pejorative appellation used by his Hebrew foes, rather than what this King called himself. Use of it may indicate that the Hebrews had concrete reasons to bear him a grudge, beyond the meager information given in the surviving Biblical text.

<text>Edward Albert Heimberger (April 22, 1906 – May 26, 2005) was an American actor. He is known for his roles on stage and screen and received nominations for two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, and two Golden Globe Awards.

Albert made his acting debut with the film &quot;Brother Rat&quot; (1938). He went on to receive two Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nominations for his roles in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972). His other notable films roles include in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; (1956), &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; (1963), &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974), and &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; (1975)
He starred as Oliver Wendell Douglas in the television sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot; from 1965 to 1971 and &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot; (1990). He also played Frank MacBride in the crime drama series &quot;Switch&quot; from 1975 to 1978. He also acted in &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;.

==Early life==
Edward Albert Heimberger was born in Rock Island, Illinois, on April 22, 1906, the eldest of the five children of Frank Daniel Heimberger, a real estate agent, and his wife, Julia Jones. His year of birth is often given as 1908, but this is incorrect. His parents were not married when Albert was born, and his mother altered his birth certificate after her marriage.

When he was one year old, his family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Young Edward secured his first job as a newspaper boy when he was only six. During World War I, his German surname led to taunts as &quot;the enemy&quot; by his classmates. He studied at Central High School in Minneapolis and joined the drama club. His schoolmate Harriet Lake (later known as actress Ann Sothern) graduated in the same class. Finishing high school in 1926, he entered the University of Minnesota, where he majored in business. When he graduated, Albert embarked on a business career. However, the stock market crash in 1929 left him essentially unemployed. He then took odd jobs, working as a trapeze performer, an insurance salesman, and a nightclub singer. Albert stopped using his last name professionally because it invariably was mispronounced as &quot;Hamburger&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1933–1949: Early roles and military ===

He moved to New York City in 1933, where he co-hosted a radio show, &quot;The Honeymooners – Grace and Eddie Show&quot;, which ran for three years. At the show&#x27;s end, he was offered a film contract by Warner Bros. In the 1930s, Albert performed in Broadway stage productions, including &quot;Brother Rat&quot;, which opened in 1936. He had lead roles in &quot;Room Service&quot; (1937–1938) and &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (1938–1939). In 1936, Albert had also become one of the earliest television actors, performing live in one of RCA&#x27;s first television broadcasts in association with NBC, a promotion for their New York City radio stations.

Performing regularly on early television, Albert wrote and performed in the first teleplay, titled &quot;The Love Nest&quot;, written for television. Done live (not recorded on film), this production took place November 6, 1936, and originated in Studio 3H (now 3K) in the GE Building at Rockefeller Center (then called the RCA Building) in New York City and was broadcast over NBC&#x27;s experimental television station W2XBS (now WNBC-TV). Hosted by Betty Goodwin, &quot;The Love Nest&quot; starred Albert, Hildegarde, The Ink Spots, Ed Wynn, and actress Grace Bradt. Before this time, television productions were adaptations of stage plays. Albert landed the starring role in the 1938 Broadway musical &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, and met Burl Ives, who had a small role in the play. The two later briefly shared an apartment in the Beachwood Canyon community of Hollywood after Ives moved west the following year. Also in 1938, Albert made his feature-film debut in the Hollywood version of &quot;Brother Rat&quot; with Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman, reprising his Broadway role as cadet &quot;Bing&quot; Edwards. The next year, he starred in &quot;On Your Toes,&quot; adapted for the screen from the Broadway smash by Rodgers and Hart.

On September 9, 1942, Albert enlisted in the United States Coast Guard and was discharged in 1943 to accept an appointment as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat &quot;V&quot; for his actions during the invasion of Tarawa in November 1943, when, as the coxswain of a US Navy landing craft, he rescued 47 Marines who were stranded offshore (and supervised the rescue of 30 others), while under heavy enemy machine-gun fire. During the war years, Albert returned to films, starring in ones such as &quot;The Great Mr. Nobody&quot;, &quot;Lady Bodyguard&quot;, and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot;, as well as reuniting with Reagan and Wyman for &quot;An Angel from Texas&quot; and co-starring with Humphrey Bogart in &quot;The Wagons Roll at Night&quot;. After the war, he resumed appearing in leading roles, including 1947&#x27;s &quot;Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman&quot;, with Susan Hayward. From 1948 on, Albert guest-starred in nearly 90 television series. He made his guest-starring debut on an episode of &quot;The Ford Theatre Hour&quot;. This part led to other roles such as &quot;Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, and in dramatic series &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot;, and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;.

=== 1950–1969: Leading man roles ===
In his first TV series, Albert portrayed Larry Tucker on the situation comedy &quot;Leave It to Larry&quot;, which ran from October 14, 1952, until December 23, 1952, on CBS. Tucker was a married man who encountered his father-in-law at work and at home. Albert had his own daytime variety program, &quot;The Eddie Albert Show&quot;, on CBS television in 1953. Singer Ellen Hanley was a regular on the show. A review in &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine panned the program, writing &quot;Mr. Albert, with the help of Miss Hanley, conducts an interview, talks a little, sings a little, and looks all-thumbs a lot.&quot; Beginning June 12, 1954, Albert was host of &quot;Saturday Night Revue&quot;, which replaced &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; on NBC. The 9:00–10:30 pm (Eastern Time) program also featured Ben Blue and Alan Young and the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra.

The 1950s also had a return to Broadway for Albert, including roles in &quot;Miss Liberty&quot; (1949–1950) and &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1952–1955). 
In 1959, Albert was cast as businessman Dan Simpson in the episode &quot;The Unwilling&quot; of the series &quot;Riverboat&quot;. In the story, Dan Simpson attempts to open a general store in the American West despite a raid from pirates on the Mississippi River, who stole from him $20,000 in merchandise. Debra Paget is cast in this episode as Lela Russell; Russell Johnson is Darius, and John M. Picard is uncredited as a river pirate. He guest-starred on various series, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, and the Westinghouse Studio One series (CBS, 1953–54), playing Winston Smith in the first TV adaptation of &quot;1984&quot;, by William Templeton.
In the 1950s, Albert appeared in film roles such as that of Lucille Ball&#x27;s fiancé in &quot;The Fuller Brush Girl&quot; (1950), Bill Gorton in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1957), and a traveling salesman in &quot;Carrie&quot; (1952). He was nominated for his first Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor with &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953). In &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), he played a womanizing Persian peddler, and in &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Action?&quot; (1962), he portrayed a lawyer helping his partner (Dean Martin) cope with a gambling addiction. In &quot;Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; (1956), he played a psychiatrist with an enthusiasm for farming. He appeared in several military roles, including &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), about the Normandy invasion. The film &quot;Attack&quot; (1956) provided Albert with a dark role as a cowardly, psychotic Army captain whose behavior threatens the safety of his company. In a similar vein, he played a psychotic United States Army Air Force colonel in &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; (1963), with Gregory Peck. Albert acted in the 1956 special &quot;Our Mr. Sun&quot; opposite Dr. Frank Baxter directed by Frank Capra.

In 1960, Albert replaced Robert Preston in the lead role of Professor Harold Hill, in the Broadway production of &quot;The Music Man&quot;. Albert also performed in regional theater. He created the title role of Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; in 1955 in Boston. He performed at The Muny Theater in St. Louis, Missouri, reprising the Harold Hill role in &quot;The Music Man&quot; in 1966 and playing Alfred P. Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 1968. In 1962, Albert appeared as Cal Kroeger on the TV Western &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Impasse&quot;. In 1964, Albert guest-starred in &quot;Cry of Silence&quot;, an episode of the science-fiction television series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. Albert played Andy Thorne, who along with his wife Karen (played by June Havoc), had decided to leave the city and buy a farm (a recurring theme in Albert&#x27;s career). They find themselves lost and in the middle of a deserted valley, where they come under attack by a series of tumbleweeds, frogs, and rocks. Also in 1964, he guest-starred as a government agent in the pilot episode of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; titled &quot;Eleven Days to Zero&quot;. Albert appeared as Taylor Dickson, a western photographer in season seven, episode 11 as “The Photographer” in &quot;Rawhide&quot;, alongside Clint Eastwood (Rowdy Yates) aired December 11, 1964.
Albert was cast as Charlie O&#x27;Rourke in the 1964 episode &quot;Visions of Sugar Plums&quot; of the NBC education drama series, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, starring James Franciscus. Bobby Diamond, formerly of the &quot;Fury&quot; series, also appeared in this episode. In 1965, Albert was approached by producer Paul Henning to star in a sitcom for CBS titled &quot;Green Acres&quot;. His character, Oliver Wendell Douglas, was a lawyer who left the city to enjoy a simple life as a gentleman farmer. Co-starring on the show was Eva Gabor as his wife Lisa. The show was an immediate hit, achieving fifth place in the ratings in its first season. The series lasted six seasons with 170 episodes. In 1968, Albert was a guest on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; episode six. He played Harvey Korman&#x27;s boss in an episode of &quot;Carol and Sis&quot;, and sang.

===1970–1995: Established actor ===
After a four-year absence from the small screen, and upon reaching age 69 in 1975, Albert signed a new contract with Universal Television, and starred in the popular 1970s series &quot;Switch&quot; for CBS as a retired police officer, Frank McBride, who goes to work as a private detective with a former criminal he had once jailed. In its first season, &quot;Switch&quot; was a hit. By late 1976, the show had become a more serious and traditional crime drama. At the end of its third season in 1978, ratings began to drop, and the show was cancelled after 70 episodes. In 1965, the year that &quot;Green Acres&quot; premiered, Albert served as host/narrator for the telecast of a German-American made-for-television film version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, which was rerun several times. The host sequences and the narration were especially filmed for English-language telecasts of this short film (it was only an hour in length, and cut much from the Tchaikovsky ballet). In 1968, he voiced Myles Standish in the Rankin/Bass animated TV special &quot;The Mouse on the Mayflower&quot;. 

In 1971, Albert guest-starred in a season-one &quot;Columbo&quot; episode titled &quot;Dead Weight&quot; as a highly decorated retired US Marine Corps major general, and combat war hero from the Korean War, who murders his adjutant to cover up an illegal contracting conspiracy scheme. In 1972, Albert resumed his film career and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as an overprotective father in &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972), and delivered a memorable performance as an evil prison warden in 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;. In a lighter vein, Albert portrayed the gruff though soft-hearted Jason O&#x27;Day in the successful Disney film &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; in 1975.

Albert appeared in such 1980s films as &quot;How to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot; (1980), &quot;Yesterday&quot; (1981), &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot; (1981), &quot;Rooster&quot; (1982 television film), and &quot;Yes, Giorgio&quot; (1982), and as the US president in &quot;Dreamscape&quot; (1984). His final film role was a cameo in &quot;The Big Picture&quot; (1989). He also appeared in many all-star television miniseries, including &quot;Evening in Byzantium&quot; (1978), &quot;The Word&quot; (1978), &quot;Peter and Paul&quot; (1981), &quot;Goliath Awaits&quot; (1981), and &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988). In 1982, Albert sang the character role of the elderly Altoum in the San Francisco Opera staging of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;. In the mid-1980s, Albert was reunited with longtime friend and co-star of the &quot;Brother Rat&quot; and &quot;An Angel from Texas&quot; films, Jane Wyman, in a recurring role as the villainous Carlton Travis in the popular 1980s series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. He also guest-starred on an episode of the 1980s television series &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, as well as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and in 1990, he reunited with Eva Gabor for a &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;. In 1993, he guest-starred for several episodes on the daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Jack Boland, and he made a guest appearance on the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; spin-off &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; the same year.

==Hollywood blacklist==
Eddie Albert&#x27;s wife, Mexican actress Margo, was well known in Hollywood for her left-wing political leanings, but she was not a member of the Communist Party. In 1950, Margo and Albert&#x27;s names were both published in &quot;Red Channels&quot;, an anti-Communist pamphlet that sought to expose purported Communist influence within the entertainment industry. This was part of a larger trend of blacklisting motion-picture professionals with known or suspected Communist leanings, unless they testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee to disavow any Communist affiliations.

Albert&#x27;s son spoke of his parents&#x27; blacklisting in an interview published in December 1972, crediting Albert&#x27;s military service during World War II with ultimately saving his career:

Albert later spoke of this period: &quot;Everyone was so full of fear. Many people couldn&#x27;t support their families, or worse, their lives were ruined and they had to go out and do menial jobs. Some even killed themselves.&quot; While Albert&#x27;s career survived the blacklist, his wife, Margo, had extreme difficulty finding work.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and family ===
Albert married Mexican actress Margo (née María Margarita Guadalupe Teresa Estela Bolado Castilla y O&#x27;Donnell) in 1945. Albert and Margo had a son, Edward Jr., also an actor, and adopted a daughter, Maria, who became her father&#x27;s business manager. Margo Albert died from brain cancer on July 17, 1985. The Alberts lived in Pacific Palisades, California, in a Spanish-style house on an acre of land with a cornfield in front. Albert grew organic vegetables in a greenhouse and recalled how his parents had a liberty garden at home during World War I.

Albert&#x27;s son, Edward Jr. (1951–2006), was an actor, musician, singer, and linguist/dialectician. Edward Jr. died at age 55, one year after his father. He had been suffering from lung cancer for 18 months.

===Activism and interests===
Albert was active in social and environmental causes, especially from the 1970s onward. 
In 1970, Albert participated in the creation of Earth Day and spoke at one of its events in that year.

Albert founded the Eddie Albert World Trees Foundation and was national chairman for the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s conservation program. He was a trustee of the National Recreation and Park Association and a member of the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s advisory board. &quot;TV Guide&quot; called him &quot;an ecological Paul Revere&quot;.

He was special envoy for Meals for Millions and consultant for the World Hunger Conference. He joined Albert Schweitzer in a documentary about African malnutrition. and fought agricultural and industrial pollution, particularly DDT. Albert promoted organic gardening, and founded City Children&#x27;s Farms for inner-city children, while supporting eco-farming and tree planting.
Albert was also a director of the U.S. Council on Refugees.

Beginning in the 1940s, Eddie Albert Productions produced films for various US corporations, as well as documentaries such as &quot;Human Beginnings&quot; (a for-its-time controversial sex-education film) and &quot;Human Growth&quot;.

In 1971 he starred in an industrial film sponsored and promoted by a major logging and forest products concern called Weyerhaeuser Company. which emphasized the Pacific Northwest. Shot partly amid old growth timber and narrated solely by Albert, the film documented industrial methods of handling such trees for market. It also shows re-planted clear cuts and emphasized &quot;the need for advanced lumber production in response to rapidly increasing population,&quot; according to the Texas Archive of the Moving Image.

===Illness and death===
Albert was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1995. His son put aside his acting career to care for his father. Albert exercised regularly until shortly before his death. Eddie Albert died of pneumonia on May 26, 2005, at the age of 99 in his home in Pacific Palisades, California. He was interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, next to his late wife and near his &quot;Green Acres&quot; co-star Eva Gabor. For contributions to the television industry, Eddie Albert was honored on February 8, 1960, with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6441 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Étienne Pierre Théodore Rousseau (; 15 April 181222 December 1867) was a French painter of the Barbizon school.

==Life==

===Youth===
He was born in Paris, France in a bourgeois family.
At first he received a basic level of training, but soon displayed aptitude for painting. 
Although his father regretted the decision at first, he became reconciled to his son forsaking business, and throughout the artist&#x27;s career (for he survived his son) was a sympathizer with him in all his conflicts with the Paris Salon authorities. 
Théodore Rousseau shared the difficulties of the romantic painters of 1830, in securing for their pictures a place in the annual Paris exhibition. 
The influence of classically trained artists was against them, and not until 1848 was Rousseau presented adequately to the public.

He had exhibited six works in the Salons of 1831, 1833, 1834 and 1835, but in 1836 his great work &quot;Paysage du Jura&quot; [&quot;La descente des vaches&quot;] was rejected by the Salon jury. He sent a total of eight further works to the Salon between 1836 and 1841; and yet none of them were accepted. Thereafter, he ceased sending work to the Salon until 1849, when all three of his submissions were accepted.
He was not without champions in the press, and with the title of &quot;le grand refusé&quot; he became known through the writings of his friend Théophile Thoré, the critic who afterwards resided in England and wrote using the name Burger.

During these years of artistic exile Rousseau produced some of his best pictures: &quot;The Chestnut Avenue&quot;, &quot;The Marsh in the Landes&quot; (now in the Louvre), &quot;Hoar-Frost&quot; (now in America); and in 1851, after the reorganization of the Salon in 1848, he exhibited his masterpiece, &quot;The Edge of the Forest&quot; (also in the Louvre), a picture similar in treatment to, but slightly varied in subject from, the composition called &quot;A Glade in the Forest of Fontainebleau&quot;, in the Wallace Collection at Hertford House, London.

===Barbizon and maturity===
Until this period Rousseau had lived only occasionally at Barbizon, but in 1848 he took up his residence in the forest village, and spent most of his remaining days in the vicinity. He was now able to obtain fair sums for his pictures (but only about one-tenth of their value thirty years after his death), and the number of his admirers increased. He was still ignored by the authorities, even while his mentee Narcisse Virgilio Diaz was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1851. Rousseau was left undecorated, but was nominated and awarded the Cross soon afterwards. He would eventually become an Officer of the Legion of Honor.

At the Exposition Universelle of 1853, where all Rousseau&#x27;s rejected pictures of the previous twenty years were gathered together, his works were acknowledged to form one of the best of the many splendid groups there exhibited. But, after an unsuccessful sale of his works by auction in 1861, he contemplated leaving Paris for Amsterdam or London, or even New York.
===Later years===
Rousseau then suffered a series of misfortunes. His wife&#x27;s mental health had worsened; his aged father became dependent on him for pecuniary assistance; his patrons were few. Moreover, while he was temporarily absent with his ill wife, a youth living in his home (a friend of his family) committed suicide in his Barbizon cottage. When he visited the Alps in 1863, making sketches of Mont Blanc, he became dangerously ill with inflammation of the lungs; and when he returned to Barbizon he suffered from insomnia and became gradually weakened.

He was elected president of the fine-art jury for the 1867 Exposition; however, his disappointment at being denied the better awards may have affected his health, for in August he became paralyzed. He recovered slightly, but was again attacked several times during the autumn. In November his condition worsened, and he died in the presence of his lifelong friend, Jean-François Millet, on 22 December 1867. Millet, the peasant painter, for whom Rousseau had the greatest regard, had been much with him during the last years of his life, and at his death Millet assumed charge of Rousseau&#x27;s ill wife.

Rousseau&#x27;s other friend and neighbor, Jules Dupré, himself an eminent landscape painter of Barbizon, relates the difficulty Rousseau experienced in knowing when his picture was finished, and how he, Dupré, would sometimes take away from the studio some canvas on which Rousseau was laboring too long. Rousseau was a good friend to Diaz, teaching him how to paint trees, for until a certain point in his career Diaz considered he could only paint figures.

==Work==
Rousseau&#x27;s pictures are always grave in character, with an air of exquisite melancholy. They are well finished when they profess to be completed pictures, but Rousseau spent so much time developing his subjects that his absolutely completed works are comparatively few. He left many canvases with parts of the picture realized in detail and with the remainder somewhat vague; and also a good number of sketches and water-color drawings. His pen work in monochrome on paper is rare. There are a number of good pictures by him in the Louvre, and the Wallace collection contains one of his most important Barbizon pictures. There is also an example in the Ionides collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

<text>Khattrī (from Sanskrit &quot;kṣatriya,&quot; &quot;the warrior or military caste&quot;) is a caste originating from the Malwa and Majha areas of Punjab region of South Asia that is predominantly found in India, but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Khatris claim they are warriors who took to trade. In the Indian subcontinent, they were mostly engaged in mercantile professions such as banking and trade. They were the dominant commercial and financial administration class of late-medieval India. Some in Punjab often belonged to hereditary agriculturalist land-holding lineages, while others were engaged in artisanal occupations such as silk production and weaving.

Khatris of Punjab, specifically, were scribes and traders during the medieval period, with the Gurumukhi script used in writing the Punjabi language deriving from a standardised form of the Lāṇḍa script used by Khatri traders; the invention of the script is traditionally ascribed to Guru Angad. During the medieval period, with the rise of Persian as an elite vernacular due to Islamic rule, some of the traditional high status upper-caste literate elite such as the Khatris, Kashmiri Brahmins and Kayasthas took readily to learning Persian from the times of Sikandar Lodi onwards and found ready employment in the Imperial Services, specifically in the departments of accountancy (siyaq), draftsmanship (insha) and offices of the revenue minister (diwan).

In the 15th century, the Sikh religion was founded by Guru Nanak, a Bedi Khatri. The second guru, Guru Angad was a Trehan Khatri. The third guru, Guru Amar Das was a Bhalla Khatri. The fourth through tenth gurus were all Sodhi Khatris. During the Sikh Empire, many Khatris formed the military vanguard of the Khalsa Army and its administrative class as Dewans of all the provinces. Hari Singh Nalwa, the commander-in-chief of the Sikh Khalsa Army, was an Uppal Khatri and responsible for most of the Sikh conquests up until the Khyber pass. Others such as Mokham Chand commanded the Sikh Army against the Durrani Empire at Attock while those such as Sawan Mal Chopra ruled Multan after wrestling it from the Afghans.

During the British colonial era, they also served as lawyers and engaged in administrative jobs in the colonial bureaucracy. Some of them served in the British Indian army after being raised as Sikhs.

During the Partition of British India in 1947, Khatris migrated enmasse to India from the regions that comprise modern-day Pakistan. Hindu Afghans and Sikh Afghans are predominantly of Khatri and Arora origin.

Khatris have played an active role in the Indian Armed Forces since 1947, with many heading it as the Chief of Army or Admiral of the Navy. Some such as Vikram Batra and Arun Khetarpal have won India&#x27;s highest wartime gallantry award, the Param Vir Chakra.

== Etymology ==
As per historian W. H. McLeod and Louis Fenech, &quot;Khattrī&quot; is a Punjabi form of the word &quot;Kṣatriya&quot;. Peter Hardy and A. R. Desai also agree that &quot;Khattrī&quot; is derived from &quot;Kṣatriya&quot;. In the Shabdasāgara, the word &quot;Khattrī&quot; used for the caste of Hindus from Punjab derives from the Sanskrit &quot;Kṣatriya,&quot; with the female member being a &quot;Khatrānī (Skt. Kṣatrāṇī)&quot; 

Dr. Dharamvir Bharati comments that in Punjabi language, &quot;Kṣatriya&quot; is pronounced as &quot;Khattrī&quot;. As per Dr. GS Mansukhani and RC Dogra, &quot;Khatri appears to be unquestionably a Prakritised form of Sanskrit word Kshatriya.&quot; According to philologist Ralph Lilley Turner, in his etymological Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Lexicon, it is the Punjabi word &quot;khattrī&quot;, meaning &quot;warrior&quot;, that derives from Sanskrit &quot;&quot;kṣatriya&quot;, whereas another similar sounding Gujarati word &quot;khātrī&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;a caste of Hindu weavers&quot;, derives from Sanskrit &quot;kṣattr̥&quot;, meaning &quot;carver, distributor&quot;, the name of a mixed caste in the Brahminical scriptures.

John Stratton Hawley and Mann clarify that the word &quot;Khatri&quot; derives from the Sanskrit &quot;Kshatriya&quot;, in Punjab&#x27;s context Khatri refers to a &quot;cluster of merchant castes including Bedis, Bhallas and Sodhis&quot;. Purnima Dhavan sees the claim as originating from a conflation of the phonetically similar words khatri and kshatriya, but refers to Khatris as a &quot;trading caste&quot; of the Sikh Gurus.

== Demographics ==
=== Before partition ===
The French traveller Jean de Thévenot visited India during the 1600s where he commented &quot;At Multan, there is another sort of gentiles whom they call Catry, the town is properly their country and from thence they spread all over the Indies.&quot; According to Dr. Madhu Tyagi, Thevenot is referring to the Hindu Khatri caste here.

The last caste-based census was conducted by the British in 1931 which regarded Khatri and Arora as a different caste. During 1931, Khatris were prominent in the West Punjab and North-Western Frontier Province (NWFP), which is now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The Khatris spoke Hindko and Potohari language. Highest percentage concentration of Khatris (excluding Aroras) were in Potohar regions of Jhelum and Rawalpindi. In NWFP, the Khatris were found mainly in Peshawer and Hazara.

Arora-Khatris were centered in Multan and Derajat regions of Punjab and NWFP. In the NWFP, the Aroras which are considered a sub-caste of Khatris by some scholars were concentrated in the districts of Bannu, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan. The Aroras spoke Jatki language which is the 9th century version of Saraiki (Multani) according to Ibbetson.

They were also found in Afghanistan at a population of 300,000 in 1880. According to an 1800s colonial source referred by Shah Hanifi, &quot;Hindki is the name given to Hindus who live in Afghanistan. They are Hindus of Khatri class and are found all over Afghanistan even amongst the wildest tribes. They are wholly occupied in trade and form numerous portion of the population of all the cities and towns, and are also to be found in the majority of large villages.&quot; 

=== After partition ===
Apart from Punjab, Khatris arrived in Delhi and Haryana among other regions after the partition where they make up 9% and 8.0% of the population respectively.

==Early history==
According to S. Sasikanta Sastri, Greek historians have mentioned that Alexander faced stiffed resistance from Indian army of &quot;Kathiyo&quot; warriors. Sastri further adds that &quot;even in present day modern-India, a group of martial caste members called Khati (Khatri) exist in North-India&quot;. Michael Witzel, writing in his paper &quot;Sanskritization of the Kuru State&quot; states the &quot;Kathaiois&quot; were Kaṭha Brahmins.

== Medieval history ==
Emperor Jahangir in his autobiography Jahangirnama while talking about the castes, he observed &quot;The second highest caste (after Brahmins in the caste system) is the Chhatri which is also known as Khattri. The Chhatri caste&#x27;s purpose is to protect the oppressed from the aggression of the oppressors&quot;.

=== Punjab ===
Historian Muzaffar Alam describes the Khatris of Punjab as a &quot;scribe and trading caste&quot;. They occupied positions in revenue collection and record keeping and learnt Persian during Mughal era. However, this profession often created conflicts with the Brahmin scribes who discontinued the use of Persian and started using Marathi in the Deccan. According to McLane, them being a trading group, had spread into many parts of India, possibly long before the 1700s and to Bengal, possibly even before the Mughals arrived.

According to a 17th-century legend, Khatris continued their military service until the time of Aurangzeb, when their mass death during the emperor&#x27;s Deccan Campaign caused him to order their widows to be remarried. The order was made out of sympathy for the widows but when the Khatri community leaders refused to obey it, Aurangzeb terminated their military service and said that they should be shopkeepers and brokers. This legend is probably fanciful: McLane notes that a more likely explanation for their revised position was that a Sikh rebellion against the Mughals in the early 1700s severely compromised the Khatri&#x27;s ability to trade and forced them to take sides. Those who were primarily dependent on the Mughals went to significant lengths to assert that allegiance in the face of accusations that they were in fact favouring &quot;Jat Sikh followers of the rebel leader, Banda&quot;. The outcome of their assertions - which included providing financial support to the Mughals and shaving their beards - was that the Khatris became still more important to the Mughal rulers as administrators at various levels, in particular because of their skills in financial management and their connections with bankers.

Khatri standards of literacy and caste status were such during the early years of Sikhism that, according to W. H. McLeod, they dominated it.

===Kashmir===
Sukh Jiwan Mal, a Dewan of Ahmad Shah Durrani, was a Khatri officer from Bhera. He liberated Kashmir from Afghan dominancy in 1754 and ratified his control over the valley by assuming his duties as a Raja. Mal was subsequently defeated in 1762 by Nur-ud-Din Bamzai, a general deputed by Durrani himself.

===Bengal===
In Bengal, Burdwan Raj (1657–1955) was a Khatri dynasty, which gained a high social position for Khatris in the region resulting in greater migration of Khatris from Punjab to Bengal. When Guru Tegh Bahadur visited Bengal in 1666, he was welcomed by the local Khatris, thereby supporting earlier waves of migration of Khatris to Bengal as well.

===Gujarat===
The Gujarat Sultanate (1407–1523) was a medieval Muslim dynasty founded by Zafar Khan Muzaffar, a member of the Tank caste of Punjabi Khatris according to the contemporary historian Shiekh Sikander or Rajputs. He started as a menial but rose to the level of a noble in the Delhi Sultan&#x27;s family and became the Governor of Gujrat. After Timur attacked the city, people fled to Gujarat and it became independent.

=== Trans-regional trading history ===
The Khatris played an important role in India&#x27;s trans-regional trade during the period, being described by Levi as among the &quot;most important merchant communities of early modern India.&quot; Levi writes: &quot;Stephen Dale locates Khatris in Astrakhan, Russia during the late 17th century and, in the 1830s, Elphinstone, was informed that Khatris were still highly involved in northwest India&#x27;s trade and that they maintained communities throughout Afghanistan and as far away as Astrakhan&quot;. According to Kiran Datar, they often married Tatar local women in Astrakhan and the children from these marriages were known as &quot;Agrijan&quot;. As per Stephen Dale, the children born out of Indo-Turkic alliance were in sufficient number to form an Agrizhan suburb in the city.

Dale states that most of the 10,000 (as estimated by Jean Chardin) Indian merchants and money-lenders in Isfahan (Iran) in 1670, belonged to the Khatri caste of Punjab and north-west India. In Iran&#x27;s Bazaars, Khatris sold cloth and various items and also practised money-lending. Dale believes that Khatris had possibly been travelling from Punjab via caravans since the era of Ziauddin Barani (around 1300 AD). Chardin specifically stereotyped and expressed disapproval of the money-lending techniques of the Khatri community. According to Dale, this racist criticism was ironic given Chardin&#x27;s non-English background but adds that it was Chardin&#x27;s way of giving an &quot;ethnic explanation&quot; to the economic disparity between Iran and India at that time.

=== Afghanistan ===
According to historians Roger Ballard and Harjot Oberoi, Afghan Hindus and Sikhs descend from the members of the country&#x27;s indigenous Khatri population who resisted the conversion from Buddhism to Islam between 9th and 13th centuries. Later, they aligned themselves to the teachings of Guru Nanak, himself a Khatri and converted to Sikhism. Hence, Khatris of Afghanistan are in no way of &quot;Indian origin&quot; but are components of the original population of the region. George Campbell says &quot;I do not know the exact limits of Khatri occupation to the West, but certainly in all Eastern Afghanistan they seem to be just as much part of the community as they are in the Punjab. They find their way into Central Asia.&quot;

=== Sikh Empire ===
The Khatris took on a prominent role in the emerging Sikh milieu of post-Mughal Punjab. According to the Khalsa Durbar Records, Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army was composed of majorly Jats followed by Khatris. Sardar Gulab Singh Khatri founded the Dallewallia Misl, an independent 18th century Sikh sovereign state in Ludhiana and Jalandhar district that would later on join Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s kingdom. In the Sikh Empire, Hari Singh Nalwa (1791–1837) an Uppal Khatri from Gujranwala, became the Commander-in-chief of the Sikh Khalsa Army. He led the Sikh conquests of Kasur, Sialkot, Attock, Multan, Kashmir, Peshawar and Jamrud. He was responsible for expanding the frontier of Sikh Empire to beyond the Indus River, up to the mouth of the Khyber Pass. At the time of his death, the western boundary of the empire was Jamrud.

Dewan Mokham Chand (1750-1814) became one of the most distinguished leaders of the Khalsa Army. He was the commander in chief of armies in Battle of Attock which defeated Durrani Empire Wazir Fateh Khan and Dost Mohammad Khan Other Khatris like Diwan Sawan Mal Chopra served as governors of Lahore and Multan, after helping conquer the region while his son Diwan Mulraj Chopra, (1814-1851) the last Punjabi ruler of Multan led a Sikh rebellion against British suzerainty over Multan after the fall of the Sikh Empire in the Anglo-Sikh Wars. He was arrested after the Siege of Multan and put to death.

Purnima Dhawan described that together with Jat community, the Khatris gained considerably from the expansion of the Mughal empire, although both groups supported Guru Hargobind in his campaign for Sikh self-government in the Punjab plains.

In the 1830s, Khatris were working as governors in the districts like Bardhaman, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar and Hazara, but independent from the Mughal rule.

== British Colonial Era ==

===Punjab===
In Punjab, they were moneylenders, shopkeepers and grain-dealers among other professions.

=== Hyderabad ===
A Peshkari Khatri family in Hyderabad State would become part of the Hyderabadi nobility and occupy the post of Prime Minister of Hyderabad. Notable individuals of the family include Maharaja Kishen Prasad, GCIE who would serve as Prime Minister of the State twice. In Hyderabad, around the mid-20th century, Khatris and Padmasalis were the leading &quot;Hindu weaving castes&quot; who owned 43% of the looms. The Khatris specialised in silk, while the Padmasalis in cotton weaving.

===Rajasthan===
In the early 19th century, the Khatris, Bhatias and Lohanas were the main trading castes in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra, Sind and Punjab. Banking, trading and business were considered &quot;traditional occupations of the Khatri in Rajasthan&quot;.

==Post-Independence==
Harish Damodaran says the rise of Khatri industrialists in post-1947 India was a consequence initially of the cataclysmic Partition, which pushed them in droves towards Delhi and its neighbourhoods. This exodus opened new opportunities for them. A combination of enterprise, articulation, and strategic closeness to the national capital— which, in itself, was becoming a major growth hub - created conditions for Khatri capital to flourish in the post-Partition period.

Damodaran adds that the land Khatris originally belonged to had very little industry and rail infrastructure until the 20th century and hence were not comparable to merchant groups like Banias in terms of scale and spread of operation. Before independence they were only regional players and their rise in phenomenal proportions was a post-independence feature. Since then, they have produced leading entities in fields of pharmaceuticals, two-wheelers, tractors, paper, tyre-making and hotels with the groups of Ranbaxy, Hero, Mahindra, Ballarpur Industries, Apollo Tyres and Oberoi respectively. They have also co-founded companies like Snapdeal, Hotmail, YesBank, IndiaToday, AajTak, IndiGo Airlines, Sun Microsystems, Max Group etc.

Punjabi Khatris and others, together with the traditionally &quot;urban and professional&quot; castes, formed a part of the elite middle class immediately after independence in 1947. According to P. K. Verma, &quot;Education was a common thread that bound together this pan Indian elite&quot; and almost all the members of these upper castes communities could read and write English and were educated beyond school.

=== Delhi NCR ===
Delhi&#x27;s population increased by 1.1 million in the period 1941–1951. This growth of 106% largely resulted from the influx of Partition migrants among other reasons. These were members of the Hindu and Sikh Khatri/Arora castes of the West Punjab. Many moved to the city for better economic opportunities.

=== Haryana ===
During 1947, Punjabis who migrated to Haryana during Partition were mostly Khatris or Aroras. As per a survey conducted by Maharishi Dayanand University, the migrant population were forced to live in camps under open sky. Only a meager 5% received &quot;grossly undervalued claims against their properties in shape of very poorly cultivable land, while remaining 95% though entitled for compensation could not get any thing to sustain&quot;. This migrant population is also referred to as ‘refugee’ and ‘sharnarthi’ (शरणार्थी) in a derogatory manner by some locals. A Punjabi organisation had approached the Haryana government with a demand to ban both words and to enact a law on the lines of the SC/ST Act with similar penalties. The community has a high literacy rate and are not dependent on money-lending and shopkeeping. They are engaged as doctors, engineers, administrators etc.

=== Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh ===
Khatris of Kashmir, also known as &quot;Bohras&quot; were traders and had the second largest Hindu population after the Pandits. Many of these Khatris had to face the brunt of 1990 Kashmiri Hindu Exodus. Khatris of Himachal Pradesh are numerically most important commercial classes are mostly concentrated in Mandi, Kangra and Chamba.

== Culture and lifestyle ==
According to Prakash Tandon, during Khatri weddings, a ritual is carried out to test the Khatri groom&#x27;s strength. The groom is supposed to slice the thick branch or stem of a Jandi Tree (Prosopis cineraria) in one blow using a sword. During the pregnancy period of a female, a baby shower ceremony called &quot;reetan&quot; or &quot;goadbharai&quot; is carried out amongst Khatris and Aroras. During the event, gifts are showered to the pregnant mother from family and friends among other traditions.

== Clan organisation ==
Historically, Khatris were divided into various hierarchal endogamous sections. This includes u&quot;rhai/dhai ghar&quot;, &quot;char ghar&quot;, &quot;barah ghar/bahri&quot; and &quot;bunjayee or bavanjah ghar&quot; which translated to House of 2.5, 4, 12 and 52 respectively. They formed the majority of Khatris and were deemed superior. This was followed by Sareen Khatris who formed a minority. Another sub-group of Khatris include Khukhrain which had split up from the &quot;bunjayees&quot;.
== Varna status ==
M. N. Srinivas states that Khatri made different Varna claims at different times in the Census of India before Independence. In 1911, they did not make any Varna claim, while in 1921 they made a claimed a Kshatriya status but later in 1931 they claimed a Vaishya status.

However, most scholars do not agree with the Khatris&#x27; claims to Kshatriya varna. They consider castes in north India, like Khatri and Kayastha to be merchant castes who claim higher status based on the educational and economic progress they made in the past.

According to Yang, the Khatris in the Saran district of Bihar, were included in the list of &quot;Bania&quot; along with Agarwals and Rastogis of the Vaishya Varna. According to Yang, their position in the Varna system should be &quot;just below&quot; the twice-born varnas. Jacob Copeman writes &quot;Agarwal, Khatri, and Bania usually denote people of merchant-trader background of middling clean-caste status, often of Vaishya varna&quot;.

While some historians agree with the claim of Khatris to be of Kshatriya varna, many others do not. According to some historians, even though they participated in mercantile or other occupationally diverse professions such as Agriculture, they were originally Kshatriyas. In Indian historian Satish Chandra&#x27;s opinion, certain castes like Khatris and Kayasthas &quot;do not quite fit&quot; in the Hindu Varna system. According to him, Khatris are neither Vaishyas nor Kshatriyas but are &quot;par excellence traders&quot;.

The Saraswat Brahmins are the purohits of Khatris and accept gifts only from them. Jürgen Schaflechner cites the historian Rowe who states that such Saraswat Brahmins who were considered a low caste, formed a symbiotic relationship with Vaishya castes such as Khatris, Lohanas, etc. who were trying to raise their varna status - which in turn would benefit the Saraswats as well. For this purpose, certain religious texts were written during the British Raj era

Susan Bayly states that the Khatris had scribal traditions and despite that Khatri caste organisations in the British Raj era tried to portray their caste as Kshatriyas. Similar caste glorifying ideas were written by the historian Puri who describes Khatris as &quot;one of the most acute, energetic, and remarkable race [sic] in India&quot;, &quot;pure descendants of the old Vedic Kshatriyas&quot; and &quot;true representatives of the Aryan nobility&quot;. Puri also tried to show the Khatris as higher than the Rajputs whose blood he considered &quot;impure&quot;, mixed with ‘inferior’ Kolis or ‘aborigines’. She considers his views to represent those of &quot;pre-Independence race theorists&quot;. Bayly further describes the Khatris as a &quot;caste title of north Indians with military and scribal traditions&quot;. Hardip Singh Syan says Khatris considered themselves to be of pure Vedic descent and thus superior to the Rajputs, who like them claim the Kshatriya status of the Hindu varna system.

=== Punjab ===
Historian Kenneth W. Jones states that the Khatris of Punjab had some justification in claiming Kshatriya status from the British government. However, the fact that this claim was not granted at the time showing their ambiguous position in the varna system. Although Jones also classifies Khatris as one of the Vaishya caste of Punjabi Hindus, he shows that their social status was higher than the Arora, Suds and Baniyas in the 19th century Punjab. He quotes Ibbetson who states that the Punjabi Khatris who held prominent military and civil posts were traditionally different from the Aroras, Suds or Baniyas who were rural, of low status and mostly commercial. Punjabi Khatris, on the other hand, were urban, usually prosperous and literate. Thus, the Khatris led the Vaishyas in seeking a higher social position in the flexible Varna hierarchy based on their superior achievements. Similar social mobility efforts were followed by other Hindus in Punjab McLane also describes them as a &quot;mercantile caste who claimed to be Kshatriyas&quot;. In the 19th century, British failed to agree whether their claim of Kshatriya status should be accepted. Nesfield and Campbell were leaning towards accepting this claim but Risley and Ibbetson cast doubts on it. McLane opines that the confusion was caused since Khatris pursued mercantile occupations and not military ones. However, he adds that this Vaishya occupation fact was balanced by their origin myths, the &quot;possible&quot; derivation of the word Khatri from &quot;Kshatriya,&quot; their large physical stature, the superior status accorded to them by other Punjabis as well as the willingness of the Saraswat Brahmins, their chaplains, to accept cooked food from them.

In the case of Sikh Khatris, their Kshatriya claim reflects a contradictory attitude towards the traditional Hindu caste system. It is evident in &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, which on the one hand rises above the Hindu caste paradigm and on the other hand seeks to portray the Khatri gurus as a group of warrior-defenders of their faith, just as with the Kshatriya varna.

Majority of the male members of the Arya Samaj in the late 19th century Punjab came from the Arora and Khatri merchant castes. In Punjab, the Kshatriya castes who were ritually higher than the Aroras and Khatris had been disempowered and thus the Brahmins who had lost their patrons had to turn to these non-Kshatriya castes. Christophe Jaffrelot explains the attraction of these trading castes to the Arya Samaj as a means of social mobility associated with their prosperity during the British rule. He cites N. G. Barrier to show that the philosophy of the Arya Samaj founder, Dayananda Saraswati, was responsible for the aspirations of these Vaishya castes from Punjab to higher status:

=== Rajasthan, Gujarat ===
Dasharatha Sharma described Khatris of Rajasthan as a mixed &quot;pratiloma&quot; caste of low ritual status but they could be a mixed caste born of Kshatriya fathers and Brahmin mothers. Banking, trading, agriculture and service are traditional occupations of the Khatris in Rajasthan. The literacy rate is appreciably high among them.

Ashok Malik, former press secretary to the President of India, says that there were two groups of Khatris in Gujarat, that arrived right after the Mughal invasion and during the reign of Akbar respectively. The latter considered themselves superior to the former and they called themselves &quot;Brahmakshatriyas&quot; after arriving in Gujarat. When the older Khatri community of Gujarat started prospering, they also started calling themselves &quot;Brahmakshatriya&quot;, causing the new Khatri community to panic and adopt the name &quot;Nayar Brahmakshatriyas&quot; for themselves. In addition, another community - the Gujarati Telis, considered an Other Backward Class (OBC) in India began to call themselves &quot;Khatris.&quot; Malik calls this as Sanskritization.

==Religious groups==
===Hindu Khatris===
The vast majority of Khatris are Hindu. Many Hindu Khatris made their first newborn a Sikh. Daughters were married into both Hindu and Sikh families according to the Khatri sub-hierarchy rules. Hindu-Sikh intermarriages among Khatris and Aroras were common in the cities of Peshawar and Rawalpindi. They worship Hinglaj Mata, Chandi Mata, Shiva, Hanuman and Vishnu&#x27;s avatars. Worship of totemistic symbols such as snakes and trees used to be common among them. Meditation upon the flame while reciting Vidhyavasini&#x27;s hymns was a common practice and reverence was paid to the dead ancestors. They are both vegetarian and non-vegetarian depending on their affiliations with the sects of Vaishnavism and Shaktism respectively. Sects of Arya Samaj, Nirankari and Radhasoami are also followed.

===Sikh Khatris===
All the ten Sikh Gurus were from various Khatri clans. The early followers of Guru Nanak were Khatris but later a large number of Jats joined the faith. Khatris and Brahmins opposed &quot;the demand that the Sikhs set aside the distinctive customs of their castes and families, including the older rituals.&quot;

Bhapa (pronounced as Pahpa) is a term used in a derogatory sense to denote Sikhs who left Potohar Region of modern-day Pakistan during Partition, specifically of Khatri and Arora caste. Bhapa translates to elder brother in the Potohari dialect spoken around Rawalpindi region. McLeod, referring to the Khatris and Aroras says &quot;The term is typically used dismissively by Jats to express opprobrium towards Sikhs of these castes. Until recently it was never used in polite company or print, but today the word is used quite openly&quot; According to Birinder Pal Singh, Jat Sikhs consider only themselves as Sikhs and consider Khatris as &quot;bhapas&quot;. In Nicola Mooney&#x27;s opinion, Jat Sikhs consider Arora Sikhs as &quot;Hindu Punjabis&quot; which reserves Sikhism for the Jats alone, denying even the fully baptised Arora as Sikhs.

=== Muslim Khatris ===
According to Historian B. N. Puri, Muslim Khatris are commonly known as Khojas in Punjab. Khattak tribe of Pashtuns is credited with origin from the Khatris but was divided in belief to its descent according to the 1883 book &quot;Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province&quot;.

== Literature and in popular culture ==
Khatris are mentioned in a popular Punjabi literature &quot;Heer Ranjha&quot; written by Waris Shah.

Heer&#x27;s beauty slays rich Khojas and Khatris in the bazaar, like a murderous Kizilbash trooper riding out of the royal camp armed with a sword
:— Waris Shah (Translated by Charles Frederick Usborne)

== Sikh theology ==

According to &quot;Bichitra Natak&quot;, traditionally said to be the autobiography of the last Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, but possibly not so, the Bedi sub-caste of the Khatris derives its lineage from Kush, the son of Rama (according to Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;). Similarly, according to the same legend, the Sodhi sub-caste claims descent from Lav, the other son of Rama.

In Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture of Sikhism, Khatri is mentioned as one among the four varnas.

Guru Gobind Singh, said the following in a swayya:

== Related communities ==
=== Arora ===
The Arora is a community that Levi describes as a sub-caste of Khatris. They originate in Punjab and Sindh region. The name is derived from their native place Aror and the community comprises both Hindus and Sikhs. As per W. H. McLeod, a historian of Sikhism, &quot;traditionally the Aroras, though a relatively high caste were inferior to the Khatris, but the difference has now progressively narrowed. Khatri-Arora marriages are not unknown nowadays.&quot;

=== Lohana, Bhatia, and Bhanushali ===
According to Claude Markovits, castes such as Bhatia and Lohana were close to the Khatris and intermarried with them. Jürgen Schaflechner mentions that many Khatris and Bhatias were absorbed into Lohanas when they arrived in Sindh during the 18th century from cities in Punjab such as Multan. He further adds that the genealogy of communities such as Khatri, Lohana and Arora is described in the composition of Hiṃgulā Purāṇ that brings them all into one mytho-historic narrative. He also notes that common mythologies found among Khatris and Lohanas. Some members, around 10-15% of the Sindhi Lohanas began working for the local rulers and hence achieved a higher status than Khatris and Lohanas. These people came to known as &quot;Amils&quot; while the ones who continued with their merchant professions came to be known as &quot;Bhaibands&quot;. The Amils then started to recruit members from the general Khatris and Lohanas.

Upendra Thakur mentions that there is a strong connection between the Khatris, Aroras, Lohanas and the Bhanushalis who all recruit the Saraswat Brahmins as their priests.

=== Gaddi ===
Gaddi is a nomadic shepherding tribe that resides in the mountainous terrains of the Himalayas. Gaddi is an amalgamation of various groups such as Khatris, Rajputs, Brahmins etc. Most Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh call themselves Khatris. There is a popular saying among them &quot;Ujreya Lahore te baseya Bharmaur&quot; meaning that when Lahore was deserted (possibly by the Muslim invasion), Bharmour was inhabited. Some Khatris clans are known to have settled there during Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign.

<text>Alopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.

Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly &quot;A. myosuroides&quot;, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.

<text>Jules Louis Dupré (; April 5, 1811 – October 6, 1889) was a French painter, one of the chief members of the Barbizon school of landscape painters. If Corot stands for the lyric and Rousseau for the epic aspect of the poetry of nature, Dupré is the exponent of its tragic and dramatic aspects.

==Biography==
Dupré was born in Nantes. He exhibited first at the Salon in 1831, and three years later was awarded a second-class medal. In the same year, he came to England where he was impressed by the genius of Constable. From then on, he learned how to express movement in nature; and the districts around Southampton and Plymouth, with their wide, unbroken expanses of water, sky and ground, gave him good opportunities for studying the tempestuous motion of storm-clouds and the movement of foliage driven by the wind. He was named an Officer of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1848. His daughter Therese-Marthe-Francoise also became a painter.

Dupré&#x27;s colour is sonorous and resonant. He showed preference for using dramatic sunset effects and stormy skies and seas as the subjects of his paintings. Late in life he changed his style and gained appreciably in largeness of handling and arrived at greater simplicity in his colour harmonies. Among his chief works are the &quot;Morning and Evening&quot; at the Louvre, and the early &quot;Crossing the Bridge&quot; in the Wallace Collection.

<doc id="838655" wikidata="Q3805133" url="?curid=838655" title="John Percival Postgate">
<text>John Percival Postgate, FBA (24 October 1853 – 15 July 1926) was an English classicist and academic. He was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1878 until his death, and also taught at Girton College, Cambridge (1877–1909) and University College, London (1880–1908). Having been passed over for the Chair of Latin at the University of Cambridge, he was Professor of Latin at the University of Liverpool from 1909 to 1920. He was a member of the Postgate family.

==Biography==
Postgate was born on 24 October 1853 in Birmingham, England, to John Postgate. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, an independent all-boys school, where he became head boy. He matriculated into Trinity College, Cambridge in 1872 as a sizar, where he read for the Classical Tripos. He was awarded a scholarship in 1874. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1876. As per tradition, his BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree.

Postgate was a college lecturer in classics Girton College, Cambridge from 1877 to 1909; the student&#x27;s of the all-women college were often left in tears following his classes. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1878; he held the post until his death. He was additionally Professor of Comparative Philology at University College London from 1880 to 1908. At Trinity College, he was a college lecturer in classics 1884 to 1903 and then a senior lecturer from 1903 to 1909. He was deputy reader in comparative philology at the University of Cambridge from 1889 to 1890. He was a possible candidate to succeed John E. B. Mayor as Professor of Latin, but he likely (and rightly) assumed the chair would got to A. E. Housman instead. In 1909, he left Cambridge and was appointed Professor of Latin at the University of Liverpool. His salary for the Liverpool chair was £500 a year plus a share in student fees (anywhere between £600 and £1000), thereby totalling more than £1000; in contrast a chair at Cambridge only paid £300. 

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1886. In 1907, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences. 

He established himself as a creative editor of Latin poetry with published editions of Propertius, Lucan, Tibullus and Phaedrus. His major work was the two-volume &quot;Corpus Poetarum Latinorum&quot;, a triumph of editorial organisation. An influential work was his often reprinted &quot;The New Latin Primer&quot;, 1888, much used in British schools over subsequent decades. While at Cambridge, he edited the &quot;Classical Review&quot; and the &quot;Classical Quarterly&quot;. He was the first honorary secretary (1903–1906) of the Classical Association, an educational organisation founded to promote the study of classical subjects in schools and universities, and was its president from 1924 to 1925.

He retired in 1920, and was made professor emeritus by the University of Liverpool. He then moved back to Cambridge.

==Personal life==
In June 1891, Postgate married Edith Allen (1863–1962), a former student of his. She was the sister of T. W. Allen, a classical scholar. Together, they had six children among whom were Raymond Postgate (a journalist, historian, novelist and food writer), and Margaret Cole (a Fabian politician). Through Raymond, he was grandfather to the animator and puppeteer Oliver Postgate and the microbiologist John Postgate FRS (1922–2014).

Postgate&#x27;s relationship with his son Raymond and daughter Margaret were strained when they championed pacificism during the First World War. While he attempted to use his influence behind the scenes to support his son when he was prosecuted for his beliefs, he otherwise disowned him and refused to acknowledge his marriage to Daisy Lansbury. He also wrote Raymond and Margaret out of his will except for a £100 a year pension for each from the age of 55.

On 14 July 1926, he was injured in a cycling accident, when he was knocked off his bicycle by a lorry in Cambridge. He was taken to Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital but died of his injuries the following day. He was worth £33,029 at the time of his death, the majority of which (£27,000) was donated to the University of Liverpool; it had first been offered to Trinity College, Cambridge, but they refused the legacy.

<text>The Sandringham line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s fourth shortest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Sandringham station in the south-east, serving 14 stations via South Yarra, Balaclava, Elsternwick, and Brighton. The line operates from approximately 5am to 12am, daily, with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. Services run every 7–8 minutes during peak hour, with services running every 15 minutes during the inter-peak period on weekdays, and every 20 minutes at night and during the day on weekends (with the exception of early Sunday mornings when services run every 40 minutes). Additionally, services run every 60 minutes overnight on Friday and Saturday nights as part of the Night Network. Trains on the Sandringham line run with a two three-car formations of Comeng or Siemens Nexas trainsets.

Sections of the Sandringham line opened as early as 1859, with the line fully extended to Sandringham in 1887. A limited number of stations were first opened, with infill stations progressively opened between 1860 and 1912. The line was built to connect Melbourne with the suburbs of Balaclava, Elsternwick, Brighton, and Sandringham, amongst others. Minor upgrades have occurred since its opening, including historical level crossing removal works and regular infrastructure upgrades.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company opened their line from Princes Bridge (later amalgamated with Flinders Street station) to a temporary station on Punt Road in February 1859, then to Cremorne (now closed) in December of that year. Shortly after, the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company opened their railway line from St Kilda to Bay Street (now North Brighton) in December 1859. Twelve months after that, the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company extended their line from Cremorne to Chapel Street (now Windsor) station, on the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company&#x27;s line, providing a second route to the city from the Brighton line. The following year, again in December, the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company extended their line to Beach (now Brighton Beach).

The link between St Kilda and Windsor, disused since 1862, was dismantled in 1867, although part of it at the Windsor end was used as a siding for some time afterwards. In 1865, the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, who owned the St Kilda line, purchased the Melbourne Suburban Railway Company and became the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay United Railway Company, and subsequently bought the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company, which was in financial difficulties, for £99,500. The Victorian Government acquired the United railway company in July 1878.

In September 1887, the Brighton line was extended to Sandringham.

=== 20th century ===

The Sandringham line became the first line in Victoria to be provided with automatic signals, with the line as far as Elsternwick converted in stages from 1915 to 1918. Then in 1919, the Sandringham line became, with the line to Essendon, the first line in the country to be electrified (apart from a test installation on the Flemington Racecourse line). Automatic signalling was provided the rest of the way to Sandringham in two stages in during 1926.

When the underground City Loop line was designed, it was not intended to cater for trains on the Port Melbourne, St Kilda, and Sandringham lines. However, a crossover was installed near Richmond to allow Sandringham trains to cross to the tracks used by the Frankston, Pakenham, and Cranbourne line trains, which had access to the underground loop. In 1985, two Sandringham trains each way were altered to run via the underground loop, and in 1987, with the Port Melbourne and St Kilda lines converted to light rail operation, all off-peak and many peak trains were routed via the underground loop. The commencement of operations involved the service stopping at three new stations—Parliament, Melbourne Central (formally Museum), and Flagstaff. The Loop follows La Trobe and Spring Streets along the northern and eastern edges of the Hoddle Grid. The Loop connects with Melbourne&#x27;s two busiest stations, Flinders Street and Southern Cross, via the elevated Flinders Street Viaduct. From 2021, Sandringham line services stopped operating through the loop as part of a timetable restructure.

=== 21st century ===
In 2021, the metropolitan timetable underwent a major rewrite, resulting in all Sandringham line trains terminating at Flinders Street without operating through the City Loop.

== Future ==

=== Network reconfiguration ===
When the new cross-city rail corridor being built by the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025 there will be a reorganisation of the Melbourne rail network. The Victorian Department of Transport and Planning plans to return the Frankston line to the City Loop, with dedicated use of the Caulfield group tunnel track. This will mean Frankston line trains will no longer through-run with Werribee and Williamstown line trains, and will again stop at City Loop stations Flagstaff, Melbourne Central and Parliament. As part of the reconfiguration, the Sandringham line would instead begin through-running services to Werribee and Williamstown lines for the first time.

Stage 4 of the Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail proposed that the Upfield and Sandringham lines be joined via a reconfigured City Loop sometime in the 2030s.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Sandringham line operates from approximately 5:00am to 12:00am (midnight) daily and all night on Friday and Saturday nights. Services run every 7–8 minutes during peak hour, with services running every 15 minutes during the inter-peak period on weekdays, and every 20 minutes at night and during the day on weekends (with the exception of early Sunday mornings when services run every 40 minutes until 10:00am). Additionally, services run every 60 minutes overnight on Friday and Saturday nights as part of the Night Network. Services don&#x27;t run via the City Loop, instead they run direct to Flinders Street.

As of December 2024, one express train during a weekday on the Sandringham line is being the 6:05pm Flinders Street service from Sandringham.

=== Operators ===
The Sandringham line has had a total of 11 operators since its opening in 1859. The line was initially operated by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company, the Melbourne Railway Company, and the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company over the course of 19 years from 1859 till nationalisation in 1878. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from 1878 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 121 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Sandringham line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. These private operators have had a combined operational period of years.

*Operated part of the route

=== Route ===
The Sandringham line forms a somewhat linear route with minor curves from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Sandringham. The route is long and is predominantly doubled tracked, however between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to 6 tracks between Richmond and South Yarra before again narrowing to 2 tracks between South Yarra and Sandringham. After departing from its terminus at Flinders Street, the Sandringham line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. However, sections of the line have been elevated or lowering into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. Despite historical removals, there are numerous level crossings still present on the line with no current plans to remove them.

The line follows the same alignment as the Cranbourne, Pakenham, and Frankston lines with the four services splitting onto different routes at South Yarra. The Sandringham line continues on its south eastern alignment, whereas the Cranbourne, Pakenham, and Frankston lines takes an eastern alignment towards their final destinations. From Balaclava, the line is never more than ~ from the eastern shore of Port Phillip. All of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs towards its terminus in Sandringham.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 14 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, and ground level designs. The majority of stations are at ground level, with elevated or lowered stations constructed in conjunction with historical level crossing removals works.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Sandringham line uses two different types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs contain three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate up to 556 seated passengers in each six-car configuration. These trains were originally built between 1981 and 1988 and were later refurbished by Alstom &amp; EDi Rail between 2000 and 2003 and UGL Rail between 2017 and 2021. Since 2021, Comeng EMUs are progressively being retired as new rolling stock is introduced to the rail network. The second type of rolling stock is the Siemens Nexas EMUs contain two doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate up to 432 seated passengers in each six-car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2005 with a total of 72 three-car sets constructed.

Alongside the passenger trains, Sandringham line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Former rolling stock ====
When the line was electrified, the Sandringham line initially used a fleet of Swing Door and Tait EMUs. Until the 2000s, the line generally used all types of EMUs operating in Melbourne.

From 1982, as the Comeng EMUs entered service, the remaining Tait stock were cascaded onto the Sandingham line, as well as on the Port Melbourne and St Kilda lines as they were banned from running in the City Loop. At the same time, the refurbished Harris trains were put into service on those said three lines. From 1991, the line went back to using the regular Hitachi and Comeng trains until its displacement with the Siemens EMU.

Hitachi EMUs were removed from the line in December 2013.

=== Accessibility ===
In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Individual upgrade projects designed around improving station accessibility have occurred in recent years, with works making significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 71% of Sandringham line stations classed as fully accessible.

=== Signalling ===
The Sandringham line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced in 1915, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 1926. The Sandringham line was the first line in Victoria to be equipped with this technology and was also the first (along with part of the Craigieburn line) to have a regular electric service.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby GCB (29 November 1786 – 21 January 1877) was a Royal Navy officer. As a junior officer he took part in the unsuccessful expedition to capture Ferrol in Spain during the French Revolutionary Wars. He later saw action during the blockade of Brest during the Napoleonic Wars before becoming commanding officer of a sloop which was sent to the Aegean Sea to defend the population of Malta from pirates; the grateful people presented him with a sword. He then sailed to the Adriatic Sea where he led a naval brigade providing artillery support to the Austrian forces during the siege of Trieste. He went on to be senior naval officer at the Cape of Good Hope and then senior officer at Mauritius, with orders to suppress the slave trade: he concluded the Moresby Treaty with Seyyid Said, the imam of Muscat, restricting the scope of local slave trading and conferring on English warships the right of searching and seizing local vessels.

Moresby later became Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Station. His main responsibility was to protect British commercial interests in Valparaíso in the face of unrest among the people of Chile. He also took an interest in Pitcairn Islands at this time and planned the emigration of the islanders to Norfolk Island.

Moresby was born on 29 November 1786 in Calcutta, part of the Bengal Presidency in British India, the son of Mary (née Rotton, 1767–1830) and Lieutenant Colonel (with 2nd Stratfordshire Militia) Fairfax Moresby Sr (1753-1820) of Lichfield.
He joined the Royal Navy in December 1799. He was assigned to the second-rate HMS &quot;London&quot; as an able seaman but was promoted to midshipman and took part in the unsuccessful expedition to capture Ferrol in Spain in August 1800 during the French Revolutionary Wars. He transferred to the first-rate HMS &quot;Royal George&quot; later that year, to the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Alarm&quot; in the Channel Squadron in March 1802 and to the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Amazon&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1802. In HMS &quot;Amazon&quot; he took part in the pursuit of the French Fleet, under the command of Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, to the West Indies and back in Summer 1805. He became a master&#x27;s mate in the third-rate HMS &quot;Puissant&quot; at Portsmouth in December 1805 and then transferred to the first-rate HMS &quot;Hibernia&quot;, flagship of the Earl St Vincent, and saw action during the blockade of Brest during the Napoleonic Wars.

Promoted to lieutenant on 10 April 1806, Moresby was appointed to the first-rate HMS &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; and, after transferring to the third-rate HMS &quot;Kent&quot; in 1807, took part in the blockade of Rochefort. He subsequently transferred to the third-rate HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet and later to the third-rate HMS &quot;Sultan&quot;. He was then made acting commanding officer first of the sloop HMS &quot;Eclair&quot; and then of the sloop HMS &quot;Acorn&quot; observing French and Venetian ships in the Adriatic Sea in Spring 1811. Promoted to commander on 18 April 1811, he became commanding officer of the sloop HMS &quot;Wizard&quot; and was sent to the Aegean Sea to defend the population of Malta from pirates; the grateful people presented him with a sword. He then returned to the Adriatic Sea where he led a naval brigade providing artillery support to the Austrian forces during the siege of Trieste in October 1813. He was appointed a Knight of the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theresa on 23 May 1814 and, having been promoted to captain on 7 June 1814, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815.
Moresby became commanding officer of the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Menai&quot; in April 1819 and went on to be senior naval officer at the Cape of Good Hope early in 1820 and then senior officer at Mauritius in 1821, with orders to suppress the slave trade: he concluded the Moresby Treaty with Seyyid Said, the imam of Muscat in September 1822 restricting the scope of local slave trading and conferring on English warships the right of searching and seizing local vessels. In one action he boarded the schooner &quot;Camilla&quot; and freed 140 slaves. Moresby became commanding officer of the third-rate HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1837 and commanding officer of the third-rate HMS &quot;Canopus&quot; in the Channel Squadron in March 1845.

==Senior command==
Promoted to rear admiral 20 December 1849, Moresby became Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Station, with his flag in the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Portland&quot; in August 1850. His main responsibility was to protect British commercial interests in Valparaíso in the face of unrest among the people of Chile. He also took an interest in Pitcairn Islands at this time and planned the emigration of the islanders to Norfolk Island which took place in 1856. Moreover, he proposed the establishment of the Esquimalt Naval Base on the West Coast of Canada, a recommendation which was taken up by the Admiralty in 1860.

Moresby was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855, promoted to vice-admiral on 12 November 1856 and promoted to full admiral on 12 April 1862. He was advanced again to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 28 March 1865 and appointed Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom on 20 April 1867 and then Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom on 17 July 1869. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 21 January 1870.

Moresby died at his home near Exmouth in Devon on 21 January 1877 and was buried at St Margaret and St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Littleham. After his death Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea and Fairfax Harbour on which it stands were named after him, as were the Moresby Islands in British Columbia.

==Family==

In August 1814, Moresby married in Malta with Eliza Louisa Williams, youngest daughter of John Williams of Bakewell, Derbyshire: they had two daughters: Ellen Mary (1820-) and Mary (1824-1908), and three sons: Commander Fairfax Moresby (1826–1858) who died in the wreck of the brig HMS &quot;Sappho&quot; off the coast of Victoria, Matthew Fortescue Moresby (1828-1918), a photographer in Australia, and Rear Admiral John Moresby (1830-1922) who surveyed the coast of New Guinea). A descendant was Admiral Sir Hugo Moresby White, Governor of Gibraltar from 1995 to 1997.

<text>Point of Order! is a 1963 American documentary film by Emile de Antonio about the Senate Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954.

==Background==
The Army–McCarthy hearings came about when the Army accused Senator Joseph McCarthy of improperly pressuring the Army for special privileges for Private G. David Schine, formerly of McCarthy&#x27;s investigative staff. McCarthy counter-charged that the Army was holding Schine hostage to keep him from searching for Communists in the Army. The hearings were broadcast live on television in their entirety and also recorded via kinescope. This film was created from those kinescope recordings.

==Synopsis==
The film uses selections from the hearings to show the overall development of the trial, beginning with introductions from several main participants, such as Joseph N. Welch and McCarthy. Each participant is shown in a still image with a brief audio recording, except for McCarthy, who is introduced with longer footage of a speech he made during the hearings.

In a sequence titled &quot;Charge and Countercharge&quot;, Senator Stuart Symington summarizes the principal charge and counter-charge of the case. This sequence includes questioning of Roy Cohn for allegedly threatening to &quot;wreck the army&quot; if David Schine were not made a General, a statement Cohn denies. The film follows with a scene in which the Army counsel questions the origin of a photograph of that shows Schine in a meeting with Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens; the photograph is shown to be cropped to suggest a closer relationship between Schine and Stevens, but McCarthy&#x27;s counsel denies any knowledge of photographic alteration.

A sequence titled &quot;The Accusation&quot; shows McCarthy accusing a member of Welch&#x27;s law firm (Fred Fisher) of membership in the National Lawyer&#x27;s Guild, which McCarthy and others accused of serving the interests of the Communist Party USA. The sequence includes a frequently quoted exchange from the hearings: Welch asks McCarthy, &quot;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&quot;
The film ends with a heated exchange between Symington and McCarthy that occurred when the hearings were about to adjourn for the day. Symington sharply questions the handling of McCarthy&#x27;s secret files by his staff. McCarthy calls this a &quot;smear&quot; against the men on his staff; and, as Symington starts to leave, McCarthy accuses him of using &quot;the same tactics that the Communist Party has used for too long.&quot; Symington returns to the microphone and says: &quot;Apparently every time anybody says anything against anybody working for Senator McCarthy, he is declaring them and accusing them of being Communists!&quot; Symington leaves and the hearings adjourn. McCarthy continues his passionate but repetitious defense of his staff and his attack on Symington, speaking to an increasingly empty chamber. The actual end to the hearings, in which McCarthy was cleared of any wrongdoing, does not appear in the film.

==Production==
&quot;Point of Order!&quot; was first imagined by Emile de Antonio and Daniel Talbot in 1961. De Antonio and Talbot thought a film about the Army–McCarthy hearings could be successful at Henry Rosenberg&#x27;s New Yorker Theater. De Antonio persuaded Richard Ellison at CBS to help him find footage of the Army–McCarthy Hearings; Ellison informed de Antonio that the network held a complete set of kinescopes for the hearings. These kinescopes totaled nearly 188 hours. Talbot initially asked Orson Welles, then Irving Lerner to direct the film, but neither man agreed to do so. Talbot hired Paul Falkenberg to edit the film, and Falkenberg asked Richard Rovere to write narration for the film, to be read by Mike Wallace. However, when Falkenberg screened a rough cut of the film for the producers, they did not approve and decided to start over. De Antonio offered to direct the film for free, which Talbot accepted.

De Antonio hired a young editor named Robert Duncan to help edit the film. Their plan was to remove any narration, music, or added scenes and create a documentary using only the footage from the kinescopes of the hearings. This approach to filmmaking—which de Antonio would use on later films—was similar to the use of assemblage in the works of modern artists like Robert Rauschenberg, who was a friend of de Antonio. De Antonio said that his two main decisions with regard to making the film were &quot;only footage from the actual hearings would be used&quot; and &quot;no preaching.&quot;

==Exhibition==
The film premiered in New York City in conjunction with the first New York Film Festival at the Museum of Modern Art in September 1963. It was released in New York on January 14, 1964. It was distributed by Continental Distributing in 103 theaters nationwide. In 1968 it was recut and shown on television, with an added introduction by Paul Newman, to provide context for audiences unfamiliar with the Army–McCarthy hearings.

Several versions of &quot;Point of Order!&quot; have appeared on the home video market in the United States. The version with the Newman introduction was released by Zenger Video in 1984, with added instructional materials for classroom use. This version ran 102 minutes. In 1986, MPI Home Video released an abridged 49-minute version (with the Newman Introduction) under the title &quot;McCarthy, Death of a Witch Hunter: a Film of the Era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy&quot;. &quot;Point of Order!&quot; was released on DVD by New Yorker Films in 2005, in its original 97-minute cut.

==Reception==
The Museum of Modern Art suggested that &quot;Point of Order&quot; may not be strictly defined as a film. De Antonio wrote that &quot;Point of Order!&quot; &quot;may have been the first political documentary in the U.S. after World War II as well as a documentary which, in opposition to prevailing trends, also changed the form of documentary.&quot;

Critical reception to the film was largely positive. Among its proponents were Dwight Macdonald, Susan Sontag, Brendan Gill, and Stanley Kaufmann. Even Roy Cohn wrote about the film&#x27;s historical significance, despite disagreement over the film&#x27;s portrayals of him and Senator McCarthy. Some film critics felt that what de Antonio made was different from what most understood as a documentary. Judith Crist wrote in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that &quot;the producers have excerpted a superdocumentary instead of creating one of their own.&quot;

==Book tie-in==
In 1964, W.W. Norton &amp; Company published the book &quot;Point of Order! A Documentary of the Army–McCarthy Hearings&quot;, in book form. The 108-page book featured still photos captured from the kinescopes of CBS. David T. Bazelon wrote the introduction and epilogue.

==Honors==
In 1993, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Nicolaes Maes (January 1634December 1693 (buried 24 December 1693)) was a Dutch painter known for his genre scenes, portraits, religious compositions and the occasional still life. A pupil of Rembrandt in Amsterdam, he returned to work in his native city of Dordrecht for 20 years. In the latter part of his career he returned to Amsterdam where he became the leading portrait painter of his time. Maes contributed to the development of genre painting in the Netherlands and was the most prominent portrait painter working in Amsterdam in the final three decades of the 17th century. 

==Life==
Nicolaes Maes was born in Dordrecht as the second son of Gerrit Maes, a prosperous cloth merchant and soap boiler, and Ida Herman Claesdr. 

He initially trained with a mediocre painter in his hometown. Around 1648, he went to Amsterdam, where he entered Rembrandt&#x27;s studio. He remained in the studio of Rembrandt for about five years. He had returned to Dordrecht by December 1653. Here he is recorded making marriage arrangements as he posted on 28 December 1653 the bans of his marriage with Adriana Brouwers, the widow of the preacher Arnoldus de Gelder.
A signed and dated picture of 1653 shows that the artist had established himself as an independent artist by that year.

In the middle or end of the 1650s, Maes traveled to Antwerp where he studied the work of Flemish artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens. During his stay in Antwerp Maes is said to have paid a visit to Jordaens&#x27;s studio and conversed with the artist at length about painting. From the 1660s, he dedicated himself almost exclusively to portrait painting. He continued to live and work in Dordrecht until 1673. He was clearly successful as attested by the fact that he paid municipal taxes on capital of 3,000 and 4,000 guilders. His high social status is demonstrated by his membership of the local civic guard, in which he reached the rank of lieutenant.
Maes moved to Amsterdam in 1673, where he resided until his death. The move was likely related to the ready market for portrait specialists after the death of the leading Amsterdam portrait painters Abraham van den Tempel and Bartholomeus van der Helst. The downturn in the art market in Dordrecht and other Dutch cities as a result of the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) of 1672, which was marked by a large-scale invasion of the Dutch Republic by French and other armies, likely also played a role. Maes must have counted on his fashionable portrait paintings to attract the patronage of Amsterdam&#x27;s larger population of prosperous burghers. His calculation was correct as Maes was so much in demand as a portraitist in Amsterdam that sitters considered it a favour to be given the chance to have the artist paint their portrait. The great number of portraits dating to the 1670s and 1680s are evidence of his success as a society portraitist. His pupils in Dordrecht included his stepson Justus de Gelder, Margaretha van Godewijk, Jacob Moelaert, and Johannes Vollevens.

Despite his long-term residency in Amsterdam starting from 1673, Maes never became a citizen of Amsterdam. He waited until 1688 to register with the Amsterdam Guild of Saint Luke, only after the municipality had demanded a list of members from the Guild. Maes registered with the Guild not as a &#x27;burgher&#x27; (citizen of Amsterdam), but as a resident. During his life he achieved financial success, as at his death his estate included 11,000 guilders in cash, two houses in Dordrecht and three houses in Amsterdam.
Maes suffered from gout in the final years of his life. His wife Adriana Brouwers was buried in the Oude Kerk, Amsterdam on 14 March 1690. On 24 December 1693, he was buried alongside his wife.

==Works==
===Biblical and mythological scenes===
In his early years as an independent artist in the early 1650s Maes painted a few biblical and mythological scenes. These include the &quot;Suffer the little Children to come unto Me&quot; (1652/3, London, National Gallery), &quot;Vertumnus and Pomona&quot; (possibly 1653, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) and &quot;Woman of Samaria at the Well&quot; (1653, Russell collection, Amsterdam). Maes&#x27;s biblical compositions were clearly indebted to his master Rembrandt&#x27;s models but show at the same time that he was capable of interpreting the Bible and the iconographic precedents in an original manner. For instance, in the &quot;Dismissal of Hagar and Ishmael&quot; (1653, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) Maes portrays Abraham banishing the handmaiden Hagar along with their son, Ishmael. By showing Hagar&#x27;s despondency and Ishmael&#x27;s isolated posture the work is one of the most moving renderings of this theme, popular with Rembrandt&#x27;s pupils. Most of Maes&#x27;s religious compositions are of cabinet size except for the &quot;Christ Blessing the Children&quot; (National Gallery, London) which depicts life-size figures.

===Genre painting===

During this early period Maes showed himself to be among the most inventive genre painters in the Dutch Republic. He introduced new themes and invented unprecedented expressive poses, gestures and facial expressions. Maes painted various genre scenes set on the domestic doorsteps (for example &quot;A young boy receiving alms from an elderly man&quot;, 1656, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) and others praising the virtues of good parenting. These works were influential on other Dutch painters such as Jan Steen. Maes applied Rembrandt&#x27;s stylistic characteristics such as the brushwork and chiaroscuro to domestic scenes that were the favourite subject matter of Dutch genre artists of his time.
His paintings of domestic interiors showing women engaged in household tasks are endowed with a solemn dignity through the play of light and shadow and the limited color palette derived from Rembrandt. Between 1654 and 1658, he created a large number of pictures of spinners, lace makers and mothers with children that express the contemporary moralistic view of the value of family life and quiet diligence. An example is &quot;The virtuous woman&quot; (1655, the Wallace Collection) which depicts a housewife sewing a shirt in a very tidy interior. An open Bible at her side implies that she is also clean and pious in spirit. A little boy at the window may indicate that the composition is a depiction of Proverbs 31, 10–19, about working hard and stretching the hand to the poor and the needy. Maes has thus transformed a simple domestic scene into an evocation of the exercise of dignity and moral uprightness in a true biblical sense.

Maes created some works showing everyday events occurring on the doorstep of a private house such as milkmaids ringing the doorbell or receiving payment or boys asking for alms. Maes was able to bestow on these mundane transactions a solemn dignity. Another theme treated by Maes in the mid-1650s are elderly female figures shown in half or three-quarter length such as an elderly woman saying grace before a simple meal, praying amid vanitas symbols or dozing over a Bible.
Maes&#x27;s major contribution in the depiction of interior space was to treat domestic interiors not as shallow, three-walled boxes but as suites of rooms. These innovations in the structuring of interior space were likely inspired by the new story element he introduced in genre painting. These inventions had an important influence on Delft genre painters including Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch in particular in the compositional arrangements of people in interior spaces. Maes&#x27;s exterior genre scenes may also have been influential on de Hooch&#x27;s courtyard views.

===Portrait painting===

In his earlier portraits Maes places his sitters who are typically dressed and presented in an austere manner against a dark background. Maes&#x27;s mature style was formed during the 1660s and shows the influence of the Flemish style of portraiture created by van Dyck, which had been introduced into the Dutch Republic in the previous decade. From this time onwards, Maes employed staging and accessories often seen in Flemish portraiture. In the 1670s Maes&#x27;s style further developed to reflect the lighter spirit of the times as he places his sitters in elegant gardens painted in light tones and with a free brushstroke. These later portraits emphasize the gestures and poses, as well as the clothes and hairstyles of the models. The stylistic evolution of his portraits shows the influence of developments in Flemish and French portraiture.

Maes painted hundreds of portraits during his mature period. These were mostly executed in two standardised formats: the first used a small rectangular canvas to depict a half-length figure within a painted oval in a while the second used on a larger format to depict a three-quarter-length figure, who would be leaning against a prop such as a column, fountain or rock. The setting was often a terrace or garden against a sunset sky. He also created many group portraits of families or just children shown at full length amidst a landscape. During the 1670s and early 1680s he painted several portraits of children in the guise of mythological figures such as Ganymede, Apollo and Diana, either as single figure or in a family group. He further painted one group portrait of a guild, the &quot;Six Governors of the Amsterdam Surgeons&#x27; Guild&quot; (1680–81, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam).

<doc id="838675" wikidata="Q4798613" url="?curid=838675" title="Arthur Ernest Morgan">
<text>Arthur Ernest Morgan (June 20, 1878 – November 16, 1975) was a civil engineer, U.S. administrator, and educator. He was the design engineer for the Miami Conservancy District flood control system and oversaw construction. He served as the president of Antioch College between 1920 and 1936. He was also the first chairman of Tennessee Valley Authority from 1933 until 1938 in which he used the concepts proven in his earlier work with the Miami Conservancy District.

== Early life ==

Arthur E. Morgan was born near Cincinnati, Ohio but his family soon moved to St. Cloud, Minnesota. After graduating from high school, he spent the next several years doing outdoors work in Colorado. During this time he learned that there was a dearth of practical understanding of hydraulic engineering. He returned home and took up practice with his father, learning about hydraulic engineering by apprenticeship. By 1910 he had founded his own firm and become an associate member of the American Society of Civil Engineers.

== Engineer ==

After the disastrous Great Dayton, Ohio Flood in 1913, Morgan proposed a system of dry earthen dams to control the river systems above Dayton. His concepts were challenged because of his lack of formal engineering training, but eventually his plans were adopted and constructed, and the subsequent years proved the effectiveness of his concepts. Because of this success, he was chosen in 1933 to design and deploy the Tennessee Valley system of dams for flood control and electrification.

== Educator ==
Always interested in progressive education, he sent his son Ernest to Marietta Johnson&#x27;s Organic School in Fairhope, Alabama, a pioneering progressive boarding school. Morgan&#x27;s first effort in education was to found the Moraine Park School, an experimental progressive school in Dayton, in 1917. In 1921, Morgan became the first president of The Association for the Advancement of Progressive Education, later renamed in 1931 as Progressive Education Association (PEA). In 1919, Morgan accepted the presidency of Antioch College to turn it around after a low point in the college&#x27;s finances. Morgan replaced the existing board of trustees, which had been dominated by quarrelsome local ministers, with prominent businessmen such as Charles Kettering, who had also backed Morgan&#x27;s efforts at the Moraine Park School. Between 1921 and 1933, board members and their friends donated more than $2 million to Antioch. Kettering alone donated $500,000. Morgan reorganized the educational program to include cooperative education and involved faculty in industrial research. The faculty, most personally chosen by Morgan, included not only academics but also architects, engineers, chemists, advertising executives, and government bureaucrats.

Until around the 1930s, Morgan was a member of the Unitarian Church. In his later life, Morgan was a Humanist Quaker, a member of the Society of Friends in Yellow Springs, Ohio, as was his son Ernest. After his departure from the TVA in 1938, Arthur Morgan was active in Quaker war relief efforts in Mexico and Finland. Among other accomplishments in the 1940s, he founded a non-profit organization to promote small communities (Community Service, Inc.), helped to set up a system of rural universities in India, and fought to protect Native American (Seneca) land from the flooding by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Morgan was the author of more than twenty books. Two in the water field demonstrated his environmental orientation and his criticism of the Army Corps.

In 1962 Morgan&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, with the help of his son Ernest, founded a progressive private school with humanist, Quaker, and Montessori influences, naming it the Arthur Morgan School.

Along with J.J. Tigert, Morgan served as a member of the Indian University Education Commission set up in 1948 with S. Radhakrishnan as a chair and Zakir Husain as a member. The commission studied Land-Grant colleges in agricultural education in the United States. He travelled across India in 1948 as part of the commission and also supported a community education initiative in Kerala called Mitraniketan begun by K. Viswanathan in 1965.

== Community organizer ==

Morgan was a leading community organizer in the postwar period. He was deeply committed to community and greatly interested in community settlements. Heavily influenced by Edward Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, Morgan gained a reputation as a Utopian dreamer. This interest in community living, coupled with Morgan&#x27;s belief in small towns and family life as the most virtuous form of living, led Morgan to participate in several projects that fostered rural community life.

As chairman of the TVA, he not only directed the building of dams and provided power; he promoted community living as well. Morgan advanced a wide variety of cooperative enterprises and cottage industries and created a number of planned towns that followed the English garden city model.

In 1937, Morgan founded Celo Community, a land trust in the mountains of Western North Carolina. The community, which still exists today, is a self-governed land trust. Although Celo does not require members to accept any particular religious creed or ideology, it is built on cooperation between members and care for the natural environment. Today, Celo is home to 40 families who live on its . 

In the 1940s, Morgan went on to found two organizations for the promotion of community, Community Service Inc. (CSI) in 1940, and in 1949 the Fellowship of Intentional Communities (FIC). CSI was created to advance family life and small towns, which Morgan saw as the necessary ingredients for a positive American future. The organization was founded on Morgan&#x27;s belief in the importance of small towns to the rapidly urbanizing nation. Small towns, he argued, provided places for people to experience respect, cooperation, and personal relationships. In the same year, Morgan founded the Fellowship of Intentional Communities, an organization that fostered relationships between communal settlements. The FIC cultivated communication and the exchange of products between communities, promoted communication between communal settlements and the outside world, and advocated for the formation of new intentional communities.

== Racism and eugenics ==
From an early age, Morgan believed in the innate inferiority of certain races. In particular, he held the view that those of Asian and African descent were &quot;the most unfit of all&quot; peoples. To illustrate this point, Morgan once wrote that, &quot;The extreme and universal immorality of the negro is a bigger blight on the country than people realize.&quot; 

In addition to his belief in white supremacy, Morgan was also a leading proponent of eugenics and what he termed &quot;euthenics&quot;. As such, he spoke widely of the need to both extinguish undesirable genetic traits seen among peoples of poor genetic stock and eliminate cultural traits seen among &quot;uncivilized&quot; peoples. With these views, Morgan became a leader in the eugenics movement, serving as a charter member and honorary president of the American Eugenics Society. Adolf Hitler cited the American eugenics movement as an inspiration for what became known as the Holocaust.

Morgan&#x27;s views on race greatly informed his actions as head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, leading him to exclude Black Americans from employment and housing opportunities offered to whites by the &quot;New Deal&quot; program. As a result, all-white towns such as Norris, Tennessee, came to characterize his vision for &quot;model&quot; communities. When sued by the NAACP for denying Black Americans equal access to jobs and housing, Morgan pushed back, claiming that &quot;Blacks had to create their own opportunities.&quot; To this day, Norris Tennessee remains almost exclusively white, as documented in James W. Loewen&#x27;s book &quot;Sundown Towns.&quot;

Despite investigations demonstrating that Morgan&#x27;s TVA had deliberately excluded Black Americans from the &quot;New Deal&quot; gains enjoyed by whites, Morgan remained defiant and unrepentant until his death in 1975. In his memoir of his TVA years, he denied any responsibility for the program&#x27;s negative effects, claiming that there was nothing else he could do but to honor the attitudes of a racist, majority white America.

<text>Charles Morgan (April 21, 1795 – May 8, 1878) was an American railroad and shipping magnate. He played a leading role in the development of transportation and commerce in the Southern United States through the mid- to late-19th century.

Morgan started working in New York City at the age of 14. He managed both wholesale and retail businesses before specializing in marine shipping. He invested in sailing vessels as early as 1819, while managing all aspects of the business from his office at the wharf in New York City. He started his first partnership for a packet company in 1831. During the 1830s, he held stakes in companies shipping to Kingston, Jamaica, and Charleston, South Carolina, from New York, and a stake in a company shipping between New Orleans and Galveston, Texas. During this time, he invested more in steamships than sailing ships. The LouisianaTexas packets became so successful that he gradually withdrew from the Atlantic trade in the late 1830s. Charles Morgan&#x27;s Steamships primary cargo from Rhode Island to the South were Slaves. 

In the 1840s and 1850s, Morgan expanded his shipping business in the Gulf of Mexico, expanding service to Mexico, Florida, and adding stops in Texas. Texas statehood and the Mexican War were boons to his enterprises of shipping mail, troops, and war material. By 1846, he sold his last stake in a sailing vessel. After 1849 and through part of the 1850s, Morgan responded to transportation demand to California driven by the gold rush. He offered passenger service from New York City to San Francisco via Panama. These activities pulled him into business alliances and rivalries with Cornelius Vanderbilt which culminated in Morgan&#x27;s support of William Walker&#x27;s filibuster in Nicaragua. Morgan also attempted to damage Vanderbilt&#x27;s investments and his business positions before they agreed to a truce in 1858. In the late 1850s, a lucrative business developed out of a segment of railroad running between New Orleans and Berwick Bay, Louisiana. The railroad terminated in a desolate part of the state, and Morgan&#x27;s steamers enabled the railroad to create revenue from an expensive infrastructure investment. In return, the railroad shortened Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana to Texas route by about 150 miles. In 1855, Morgan incorporated his assets for the first time, co-founding the Southern Steamship Company. With family and other close friends managing the company, Morgan accelerated his investments in steamboats.

During the Civil War, he lost some of his investments to seizures by the North and the South. Most of the steamers seized were corporately owned by the Southern Steamship Company, which led to its liquidation in 1863. Morgan, however, prospered during the war despite these losses. He ran blockade runners for the Confederacy, but his most profitable venture during this period was the Morgan Iron Works. This shop built engines for thirteen ships sold to the Union Navy. At the end of the war, he repurchased some of these steamships at favorable prices.

During Reconstruction, Morgan sold his interest in the Morgan Iron Works. He also took advantage of the buyer&#x27;s market for steamships and expanded his fleet. He resumed his Gulf packet service between New Orleans and Texas, and between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. In 1869, he acquired his first railroad. Two more railroad acquisitions followed in the 1870s. He died on May 8, 1878, at his home in New York City. Just prior to his death, he incorporated Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company and distributed his shares to several family members.

==Family life==
Charles Morgan was born April 21, 1795, to George and Betsy Morgan. His native town was then known as Killingworth, Connecticut, but is now known as Clinton. Charles had a younger sister named Wealthy Ann (b. September 6, 1798) and older brothers, Elias (b. September 26, 1790) and John (b. December 3, 1791).

George Morgan was a successful farmer, and Charles had a comfortable upbringing in a rural area. However, a changing economy induced Charles to follow his brothers who had moved to New York City in 1809. He married Emily Reeves in 1817, several years after establishing himself as a merchant, and they had five children together: Emily Ann (1818), Frances Eliza (1823), Charles W. (1825), Henry R. (1827), and Maria Louise (1832). They remained married until Emily&#x27;s death in 1850.

Morgan&#x27;s daughter Frances Eliza married George W. Quintard in either 1843 or early in 1844. Like her father, Quintard grew up in Connecticut and left his hometown as a teenager seeking opportunity in New York City. Concurrent with his marriage, Quintard opened a shop, combining a grocery and ship chandlery. In 1847, he joined the marine engineering firm of T. F. Secor &amp; Co., in which Charles Morgan was a partner, and in 1850, Quintard and Morgan purchased the firm outright and renamed it the Morgan Iron Works. Morgan&#x27;s eldest daughter Emily Ann married Israel C. Harris of New Orleans. In December 1847, Harris founded a partnership with Charles Morgan&#x27;s youngest son Henry, and the firm of Harris &amp; Morgan assumed agency for all of Morgan&#x27;s ships. In 1853, Maria Louise Morgan married Charles A. Whitney, a shipping agent. Out of Morgan&#x27;s family, his sons-in-laws assumed the most active roles in his transportation businesses. His eldest son, Charles W., eschewed the shipping business and opened his own grocery in 1849. His youngest son, Henry Morgan, married Laura Mallard of New Orleans in 1854.

On June 24, 1851, Morgan married his second wife, Mary Jane Sexton, who taught math and French in New York. Charles and Mary Jane Morgan commissioned the construction of a large mansion at 7 East 26th Street, where they resided from 1852 until their deaths.

==Early career==

Charles Morgan left home for New York City at age fourteen to work for a merchant, but he later started his own import business. His arrival in the city and coming of age coincided with the growing importance of New York as a port. He conducted business as both a grocer and a chandler, but his early business activities included importer and exporter, retailer and wholesaler, and shipping merchant.

Morgan owned stakes in eighteen sailing packet ships and fifteen sailing tramp vessels between 1819 and 1846. In addition to equity shares, he acted as ship&#x27;s husband for seven vessels of The Ship Line, and for thirteen sailing vessels in which he had owned shares. His duties as husband included bookkeeping, dispatching, maintenance, and outfitter. In 1831, Morgan partnered with Benjamin Aymars to establish the first packet service from New York to Kingston, Jamaica. He also served as line master, who was responsible for coordination of all ships within the shipping line.

== Shipping companies ==

===New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company===

The New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company was formed in June 1834 by Charles Morgan, James P. Allaire, and John Haggerty. Allaire owned an iron foundry which counted Robert Fulton among its clients, and he acquired Fulton&#x27;s shop after his death and combined it with his existing foundry. He had the side-wheeler &quot;David Brown&quot; built and dispatched it to run between New York and Charleston, South Carolina, in November 1833. The firm acquired the &quot;William Gibbons&quot; the same year, and by March 1, 1834, both steamers were making weekly runs.

At this time, sailing vessels still dominated ocean navigation, including the coastal trade, but Morgan and his brother-in-law John Haggerty joined with Allaire to develop coastal steam packets, focusing on the route between New York and Charleston. Morgan was the operations manager of the New YorkCharleston line, as well as the Jamaica packet line. By June 1835, he was dispatching two steamers per week to Charleston, &quot;David Brown&quot; and the newly acquired &quot;Columbia&quot;. The packet company had won the bid for the United States Mail contract, worth $7,200 annually, and its ships were earning more than $1,000 per trip in profits.

However, the risks faced by ocean-going steamers threatened the company. &quot;William Gibbons&quot; sank in October 1836, which caused a loss of public confidence in addition to the direct financial loss. Some of the investors sold &quot;David Brown&quot; and then abandoned the company, leaving Morgan, Allaire, and Haggerty as the sole partners and &quot;Columbia&quot; as their only ship. Yet the partnership built new steamers of the line which they christened &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;New York&quot;, and they accomplished this despite the Panic of 1837. They also supplemented their packet revenue with contracts to carry mail along their line, and contracts to carry military troops to Florida.

Another lost ship threatened the New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company. &quot;Home&quot; started its last voyageand only its third overallon October 7, 1837. &quot;Home&quot; had cost nearly $90,000 to build and included a cabin with luxury amenities to accommodate as many as 120 first-class passengers. She ran aground while departing New York Harbor, but continued to the ocean without any apparent damage. However, a storm with rough seas battered the ship near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; she started taking on water and her engine failed, and her sails were not able to drive and control the ship. The storm pushed &quot;Home&quot; toward the shore and ran it aground, and 99 people died trying to reach land.

===Gulf coast packets===
In 1837, Morgan started running steamboat service between New Orleans and Galveston, Texas, which was the first packet boat service running between these cities on a regular schedule. However, this had not been Morgan&#x27;s first foray in shipping in the Gulf of Mexico. The previous year, the New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company deployed the steamship &quot;David Brown&quot; to sail a route from New Orleans to Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba. The &quot;Home&quot; catastrophe forced a reorganization of the partnership, with the new company shifting its emphasis to the Gulf trade, and &quot;Columbia&quot; sailed out of the port of New Orleans for Galveston on November 18, 1837, about five weeks after the &quot;Home&quot; wreck.
Allaire and several investors divested themselves from the New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company, leaving Morgan and John Haggerty as the sole partners: thus the Morgan Line was born and &quot;Columbia&quot; was its first ship, committed to the New OrleansGalveston route. During this era, New Orleans was the main port for Gulf traffic, and the newly formed Republic of Texas attracted many immigrants and demand for trade goods. On June 8, 1838, the owners of &quot;Columbia&quot; and the owners of the steamship &quot;Cuba&quot; formed a cartel known as the &quot;New Orleans and Texas Line&quot;, which included coordination of rates and scheduling of shipping between New Orleans and Galveston. The New Orleans and Texas Line dominated transportation in the two cities after the last half of 1838.

Gulf trade experienced seasonal cycles. June marked the beginning of the slack season, which lasted throughout the summer and part of the fall, and business picked up again in early October. Morgan would remove some of his ships from service during slack times and send them to New York for refitting and repairs. He continued to maintain New York City as his residence and the main location for shipbuilding and repair, even though his main shipping market was located on the Gulf coast. He sold the last of his sailing vessels in 1846, while he increased his investment in T. F. Secor &amp; Company, a builder of marine steam engines.

===Mexican War===
During the Mexican War, Morgan accepted various contracts to move U.S. troops, deploying &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Galveston&quot; for military transport, and collecting nearly $80,000 (~$ in ) in less than six months in 1846. This compromised packet service, including its contract for carrying the U.S. mail. Morgan had won a contract to transport mail for the Republic of Texas, which he continued after Texas received statehood and the U.S. Mail Service took over in 1846.Morgan lost the &quot;New York&quot; in a hurricane in September 1846, and he required a larger steamship fleet to meet the demands of passenger service, civilian trade, mail service, and military transportation. He acquired five steamers in 1847, the first of which was the &quot;New Orleans&quot;, launched from New York on January 12, 1847. He paid $120,000 for the 869-ton steamship new, but it produced only $33,000 in revenue for moving troops. He sold it five months after its launch for $125,000. The other 1847 steamer purchases were for steamships already in use. &quot;Palmetto&quot; was built in 1846, and most of its interest sold to Morgan in March 1847. Captain Jeremiah Smith commanded the 533-ton steamer and spent about three months on charters for the United States Army. Afterward, &quot;Palmetto&quot; entered packet service for New Orleans and Galveston. Captain Smith maintained a small interest in &quot;Palmetto&quot; and became an investment partner with Morgan in the 249-ton steamship &quot;Yacht&quot;, a much smaller vessel better suited for navigating the sandbars of the Texas coast. &quot;Portland&quot; was a steamer built in 1835 which originally served the coast of Maine; she was brought into the Morgan fleet late in 1847 and assigned to move military troops and equipment out of New Orleans. The fifth and last acquisition in 1847 was &quot;Globe&quot;, which was placed immediately into packet service.

After the war, Morgan obtained the charter business for taking troops home. Later, he deployed his steamers to expanded packet service. Service in Texas expanded to Indianola, Port Lavaca, and Brazos St. Iago. The last of these ports facilitated outbound shipments of precious metals, hides, and wool. Starting in 1850, the Morgan earned $15,000 annually for carrying mail in and out of Brazos St. Iago, and $12,000 for the mail route from New Orleans to Galveston and Indianola.

===Gold rush===

==== Panama ====

After the discovery of gold in California in January 1848, news emanated to the eastern United States in the last quarter of that year. With financial capital and the means of production still concentrated near the Eastern seaboard, there was demand for transportation to carry people and supplies to the Pacific coast. In January 1849, no fewer than 90 marine vessels departed eastern ports bound for California. Through mid-April 1849, the port of New York dispatched 226 California-bound vessels carrying a total of about 20,000 people.

The shortest wholly oceanic route from New York was over 14,000 nautical miles, and even a few hundred miles longer from New Orleans. Yet this distance from New York could be reduced to less than 5,000 miles with a multi-modal short-cut across the Isthmus of Panama. The Royal Steam Packet Company, one of three companies operating across Central American just prior to the gold rush, ran a route from London to Panama, then overland to the Pacific. Two companies, the U.S. Mail Steamship Company and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, serviced US government contracts using a similar transport corridor. The heightened transportation demand made these enterprises highly lucrative in 1849. At the same time, demand outstripped supply in early 1849, especially on the Atlantic side, and Charles Morgan first entered this market as a major shareholder of &quot;Crescent City&quot;, which his agent J. Howard &amp; Son dispatched to Chagres, Panama, from New York. Morgan acquired the newly built &quot;Empire City&quot;, adding to the Panama service, with the two ships forming the Empire City Line. Morgan and John T. Howard increased their investment in westbound transportation throughout 1849 and 1850, first buying the screw-steamer &quot;Sarah Sands&quot;, then four more ships of the line, three of which sailed the Pacific side from Panama to San Francisco.

A business collaboration between Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt was spurred by a disabled ship. By accident, the two men departed New York on Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Crescent City&quot; on December 14, 1849. Both were travelling in order to investigate the transportation business in Central America. A failing engine caused the steamer to limp into Charleston for repairs. Each man improvised transportation toward the Gulf of Mexico. Vanderbilt chartered a ship for Havana and carried with him eight other passengers after observing that Morgan chartered a ship for himself and several other passengers, sealing the deal by buying the ship&#x27;s cargo of lumber.

====Nicaragua====
Morgan and Howard operated three steamers from the Pacific side of Panama in 1850, compared to four operated by U.S. Mail Steamship Company. Pacific Mail Steamship Company added four ships to its Pacific fleet for a total of seven, creating a competitive market for passengers in 1850. Morgan withdrew from the competition for the trade across Panama late in 1850, though he did not withdraw from the trade across the isthmus. Seeking to shorten the trip from New York to the west coast, he probed crossings several hundred miles west through a water and land route via Nicaragua. This led initially to a business alliance between Morgan and Vanderbilt, who had previously secured comprehensive right-of-way charters with the Nicaraguan government. On August 27, 1849, American Atlantic and Pacific Ship-Canal Company gained a concession for exclusive rights to construct a canal to the Pacific. In exchange for this and additional concessions, Nicaragua received cash, a right to stock in the canal, and annual cash payments. Under a separate deal, Vanderbilt also gained the right-of-way through Nicaragua using any means of transportation, which would remain in effect even if his company did not complete the canal. However, this second deal was signed after a civil war split Nicaragua into rival governments. The agreement was negotiated between Joseph L. White and the conservative faction which ruled out of the city of Granada, and conveyed the rights to construct a canal to the Vanderbilt-controlled Accessory Transit Company. The parties signed on August 14, 1851.

Vanderbilt began operating routes from New York to San Francisco on his New and Independent Line. Morgan placed his own ships into service of Vanderbilt&#x27;s company, running his Empire City Line steamers from New York, as well as &quot;Mexico&quot; from New Orleans, all of which put in at the port of San Juan del Norte. In September 1852, Vanderbilt resigned as president of the company and divested most of his interests the following December. He retained a commission as the company&#x27;s agent and a percentage of the company&#x27;s business across Nicaragua. Morgan was part of a short-lived alliance with Vanderbilt as late as February 1853. Accessory Transit Company reported net revenue in excess of $535,000 (~$ in ) in its semi-annual report at the end of 1853; however, this report failed to account for stock dilution, accounts payable to the government of Nicaragua, and the debt settlements to Vanderbilt. In the same year, Morgan deposed Vanderbilt as the agent of the line while the Commodore was vacationing. An anti-Vanderbilt faction seized the control of the board, and they appointed Morgan president of the Accessory Transit Company.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported decades later in its obituary of Vanderbilt that he penned the following missive directed at his enemies, &quot;You have undertaken to cheat me. I won’t sue you for the law is too slow. I’ll ruin you.&quot; According to two historians, this is at best apocryphal. In the fall of 1853, Vanderbilt entered the Atlantic–Pacific trade to compete with his former partners. He formed the Independent Opposition Line with &quot;North Star&quot; sailing the New York–Nicaragua leg, and partnered with Edward Mills and his two steamers to run on the Nicaragua–San Francisco leg. The Independent Opposition Line offered aggressively priced fares, triggering a three-way price war between Vanderbilt, Morgan&#x27;s Accessory Transit Company, and the U.S. Pacific Mail Lines. Vanderbilt&#x27;s low fares damaged his competitors. After less than a year, the Morgan-led Accessory Transit Company and the U.S. Pacific Mail Lines agreed to pay over $1 million to Vanderbilt, in return for Vanderbilt leaving the market. This payment included a total of $800,000 for his two ships on the Pacific side and $40,000 per month in cash for a non-compete agreement. With Vanderbilt out of the field, the remaining carriers were able to restore their rates.

Morgan and C. K. Garrison participated in a scheme devised by Edmund Randolph to support the filibuster of William Walker in Nicaragua. Randolph and Walker were old friends. Walker readily accepted Randolph&#x27;s plan to invalidate the old transit concessions to Accessory Transit Company so that the new transit concession would eventually convey to a new company headed by Garrison and Morgan. They divested of their Accessory Transit Company stock, while Morgan even took short positions. Patricio Rivas of the Liberal-faction assumed the title of Provisional President of Nicaragua, under the supervision of Walker. Vanderbilt and two other investors accumulated enough Accessory Transit Company stock to gain a majority of its shares, recapturing control of the company and causing losses on Morgan&#x27;s short positions. With Vanderbilt back in control as an investor, Morgan resigned his directorship on December 21, 1855. Yet Morgan responded to this financial and professional loss by doubling down. In the first part of 1856, Morgan went on another short selling binge, matched each time by Vanderbilt and his allies. Morgan failed in weakening the price of Vanderbilt&#x27;s stock and suffered great financial losses on the process. By 1858, Morgan withdrew from running steamers on the Pacific and from transit in Nicaragua. At the same time, Vanderbilt sold his fleet of Gulf packets to Morgan, ending the feud between Morgan and the Commodore.

===Southern Steamship Company===
Morgan incorporated the Southern Steamship Company on March 14, 1855. Chartered in Louisiana, it opened some of his Gulf shipping interests to outside investors. Morgan was a minority shareholder, controlling only 500 of 4,000 shares. However, two of the members of the board were Morgan&#x27;s New Orleans agents, Israel Harris (his son-in-law) and Henry R. Morgan (his son). Their partnership, Harris &amp; Morgan, was also the largest shareholder, controlling 890 of 4,000 shares, so the triumvirate of Charles Morgan, Henry Morgan, and Israel Harris controlled 1,390 of 4,000 shares. A third board member, Cornelius B. Payne, was a junior partner of Harris &amp; Morgan and owned 250 shares of stock in the Southern Steamship Company. The fourth board member was a close friend of Charles Morgan, a New Orleans grocer, E.J. Hart. Morgan completed his requirements to capitalize the corporation at $400,000 (~$ in ) by transferring several assets on June 10, 1856. The assets received by the Southern Steamship Company were four steamships, the New OrleansGalvestonIndianola mail contract, eight enslaved persons, and sundry equipment. Through incorporation, Morgan attracted new investors while still maintaining a large portfolio of assets apart from the Southern Steamship Company. Incorporation also represented a partial withdrawal from management of Morgan&#x27;s interests and a new role as a passive investor.

On October 1, 1856, the Southern Steamship Company secured a mail contract serving Brashear, Louisiana and Galveston. Brashear was located at the western terminus of the New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western Railroad (NOO&amp;GW), navigable from Berwick&#x27;s Bay on the Gulf of Mexico. The NOO&amp;GW was planned to span from New Orleans to the Pacific Coast, but higher than expected construction costs prevented the company from building beyond this swampy, inaccessible, and sparsely populated area of Louisiana. After fending off a serious challenge from Cornelius Vanderbilt, the Southern Steamship Company forged a mutual freight agreement with the NOO&amp;GW. The eastern terminal of the NOO&amp;GW was located in Algiers, Louisiana, directly across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. Freight delivered to the railroad at Algiers avoided New Orleans taxes and wharfage fees. In addition, transferring western-bound freight to the railroad eliminated both navigating the Mississippi River and shortened the western route to Galveston by about .

Morgan himself had negotiated the complex freight deal between the Southern Steamship Company and NOO&amp;GW. Southern Steamship agreed to transport freight for the railroad from its Brashear terminal to Galveston (via Sabine Pass, Texas), and to Indianola, Texas (via Galveston). The Southern Steamship Company received a percentage of NOO&amp;GW&#x27;s freight receipts based on a multiple-tiered formula. NOO&amp;GW also agreed to move freight for the Southern Steamship Company at a discount, and provide its ships with a wharf at Brashear. The steamship service not only carried mail and other freight, but carried over 16,000 passengers from Brashear to Texas in 1859, and over 28,000 passengers in 1860.

==American Civil War==

Morgan was a lifetime resident of the northeast. He grew up in Connecticut and maintained a primary residence in New York City his entire adult life. However, he was &quot;a more-than-casual slaveholder,&quot; acquiring no fewer than thirty-three enslaved persons through the start of the American Civil War. In a very early action of the Civil War, one of Morgan&#x27;s steamships, the &quot;General Rusk&quot;, transported Texas troops. The State of Texas adopted its ordinance of secession on February 4, 1861, and appointed E.B. Nichols as its Commissioner and Financial Representative on February 7. Nichols had already been serving Morgan as his shipping agent in Galveston. He booked Morgan&#x27;s &quot;General Rusk&quot; to transport troops for $500 per day. Shortly after, this Texas force captured the United States Army Base at Brazos St. Iago. Yet, Morgan used the same steamer to transport the fleeing Union troops from Brazos St. Iago to Key West, Florida.

Morgan kept his fleet in the Gulf ports, even after the attack on Fort Sumter. Louisiana Governor Thomas O. Moore mandated a seizure of three ships from the Southern Steamship Company, viewing Charles Morgan as a northerner and a threat to the Confederacy. While Morgan never sided with the Confederacy, Israel Harris did. The ships were allowed to travel on a limited basis, but with many inspections at the ports of New Orleans and Galveston. At Galveston, the ranking officer, Sidney Sherman, seized two of Morgan&#x27;s vessels. Nichols interceded on Morgan&#x27;s behalf, and Sherman agreed to allow the Morgan steamers passage off Texas waters. However, he did keep the &quot;General Rusk&quot; for the Confederate fleet. With the United States mail service discontinued and the effective Union blockade of southern ports, Morgan&#x27;s steamship empire was idled. The Southern Steamship Company, which had entered the Civil War with twelve steamships, sold two of them, and lost the other ten when General Mansfield Lovell expropriated them on behalf of the Confederacy on January 16, 1862. The company was left without a fleet and without compensation for its seized assets, thus it folded in 1863.

Despite the losses borne by the Southern Steamship Company, Morgan continued to operate other ventures by doing business with both the Union and the Confederacy. Morgan placed orders with Harlan and Hollingsworth for five large steamers between 1862 and 1864. These ships were frequently booked on charters for the Union during the war. Morgan also profited from his ownership of the Morgan Iron Works, which was producing engines from its shops in New York City for commercial enterprises in the United States and abroad. Beyond civilian production, the Morgan Iron Works built engines and other marine equipment for thirteen ships in the Union Naval fleet. In one case, they built a warship from scratch: . These naval contracts accrued over $2 million in revenue to the Morgan Iron Works. For the Confederates, Morgan ran the &quot;Frances&quot; to evade Union blockades between Havana and the southern ports.

==Reconstruction==
===Sale of Morgan Iron Works===
After the Civil War, demand for steamships flagged and the federal government placed some of their vessels on the market. Morgan had already anticipated the buyer&#x27;s″ market for steamships as early as the fall of 1865. In 1867, Quintard and Morgan sold their interests in the Morgan Iron Works to John Roach for $450,000 (~$ in ). Morgan bought four steamers from the U.S. Navy. Morgan had sold two of these to the Navy during the war: &quot;Austin&quot; and &quot;William G. Hewes&quot;. In another case of making money on both ends, Morgan sold three steamships to the federal government for $495,000, then repurchased them a year later for $225,000. Included in this expansion of his fleet, he ordered eight new ships from Harlan and Hollingsworth between 1865 and 1867.

Quintard proposed a new investment idea to Morgan in 1867. This resulted in the formation of the New York and Charleston Steamship Company (not to be confused with the New York and Charleston Packet Company). The new company started by acquiring &quot;Manhattan&quot; from Morgan&#x27;s youngest son-in-law, Charles A. Whitney. Next they purchased two large steamers, &quot;Champion&quot; (1,452 tons) and &quot;Charleston&quot; (1,517), and chartered the steamer &quot;James Adger&quot;.

Morgan forged a rate deal with the Pontchartrain Railroad on April 17, 1866. He received 75 percent of the revenue for their freight traveling on his steamships between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. At first, Morgan faced open competition from other carriers on the route, but in 1868, he paid $250,000 (~$ in ) in exchange for being the exclusive carrier. However, after 1870, Morgan competed for business with a railroad running between the two cities.

On May 3, 1866, Morgan signed a new contract with the NOO&amp;GW railroad. This deal contained many of the provisions of the eight-year contract they implemented before the war. Morgan received a percentage of the freight receipts based on multiple-tiers, received a fifty percent discount moving his supplies on the railroad, and the railroad would provide wharfage at the western terminus at Brashear. As before, Morgan&#x27;s steamship transported freight from the western terminus of the railroad at Brashear to the Texas ports of Galveston and Indianola.In the late-1860s, Morgan&#x27;s steamships carried much of the eastbound freight for a growing coastal Texas cattle industry. He offered new service in 1867 to Rockport, Texas, hauling outbound hides and beef products. The new port on Aransas Bay exported over 2 million pounds of hides and over 1.7 million pounds of wool by 1869. The port of Indianola served the area around Matagorda Bay, where five meatpacking facilities were located by 1870. Indianola exported cattle, hides, wool, cotton, and processed meat.

There was a major managerial re-alignment in 1867. Preceded by the departure of George Quintard and Henry Morgan, both of whom pursued new paths as independent financiers, his agent in New Orleans, Israel C. Harris, retired on April 1 before dying on Christmas Eve. Morgan hired a new agency for the Crescent City, headed by another one of his son-in-laws, Charles A. Whitney. Whitney &amp; Company&#x27;s other partner was another Morgan associate by the name of Alexander C. Hutchinson. Morgan granted them total authority over the Morgan Line, which operated between Louisiana and Texas.

===Railroad ownership===
To this point, Morgan had invested in the first-tier mortgage bonds of the NOO&amp;GW, but had not yet held equity in any railroads. The NOO&amp;GW had fallen behind in its coupon payments. The Illinois Central Railroad, a large bondholder, filed suit on June 10, 1868. The following year, William S. Pike approached Morgan to join a group of 26 NOO&amp;GW bondholders to force a court-ordered sale of the railroad. Morgan refused to join the suit, and Pike dropped the plan. Several months later, in September 1868, Morgan offered a complex counter-proposal to act as an operator and lessee of the NOO&amp;GW. Morgan agreed to buy all of the NOO&amp;GW&#x27;s debt, while taking responsibility for two-thirds of the debt for building the railroad to Sabine Pass, Texas. In Pike&#x27;s opinion, the bondholders would be offering as much as a fifty percent discount on their assets, thus he declined the offer. Morgan predicted a bankruptcy in the NOO&amp;GW&#x27;s near future. Shortly later, Morgan retained Miles Taylor as legal counsel, who filed a series of legal actions against the railroad. One of these suits competed against an earlier lawsuit filed in federal court by the Illinois Central Railroad, which was attempting to force the NOO&amp;GW into liquidation. This was inimical to Morgan&#x27;s financial interests since he was a major bondholder, and Taylor&#x27;s suit asked for a court-ordered sale of the railroad. The Illinois Central&#x27;s suit was dismissed in Federal District Court, and Morgan won his suit, sending the NOO&amp;GW into an auction at the New Orleans Custom House. Through an agent, Morgan purchased the NOO&amp;GW on May 25, 1869, for $2,050,000 (~$ in ).

Morgan, for his more than $2 million, owned the entire NOO&amp;GW. He renamed it &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas Railroad&quot;. At the time of purchase, the assets included a terminal each at Algiers and Brashear, and eighty miles of single-track in between. The Algiers terminal included forty acres with 370-feet of frontage on the Mississippi River, directly across from New Orleans. It was highly modernized for its time, incorporating innovative cargo-handling equipment such as Link Belt steel conveyor belt &quot;Endless Freight Conveyors&quot;. The Brashear terminal included coal yards, warehouses, and wharves, with 330-feet of frontage on the Atchafalaya River. Along its track, the NOO&amp;GW had built many miles of trestles over the watery right-of-way, and also maintained depots and rolling stock.

Morgan purchased a large share of equity of the San Antonio and Mexican Gulf Railroad (SA&amp;MG) on May 25, 1870. His steamers had long served the Texas port of Indianola, and he met the competition of railroad transport to Indianola by his own railroad investment. Morgan, and the other owner, Henry S. McComb, renamed the company the Gulf, Western Texas, and Pacific Railroad. Morgan acquired McComb&#x27;s interest in the railroad in May 1872.

With steamboat service from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama, discontinued, the LouisianaTexas service accounted for most of Morgan&#x27;s marine business. High taxes and fees increased the costs for doing business in New Orleans. The city&#x27;s access to the Mississippi River was less important in light of Morgan&#x27;s Texas and Louisiana Railroad. After the dredging of the Atchafalya River in 1872, Morgan moved all of his Louisiana steamboat operations from New Orleans to Brashear, relying on the ferry from New Orleans to Algiers, and his railroad from Algiers to Brashear to convey his westbound passengers and freight. He also shifted investments from wharfage at Lake Ponchartain and in New Orleans to expanded facilities in Brashear. By around 1875, Morgan&#x27;s payroll included about 800 workers in Brashear, with the wharf spanning over 2,600 feet. In February 1876, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Morgan City.

By the 1870s, the Southern Steamship Company had expanded its geographical reach through new assets and alliances. For example, a Morgan agent in 1873 was able to sell a single ticket for passage between New Orleans and San Antonio, Texas, which employed several modes of transportation. Starting on rail from Algiers, Louisiana, the journey included coastal steamboat passage combining two packets, another rail segment, and finally the passenger reached San Antonio via stagecoach.

Meanwhile, in Texas, Morgan started withdrawing from Galveston as a port. The Galveston Wharf Company no longer gave his ships favored treatment. In addition, the only railroad from that citythe Galveston, Houston and Hendersoncould not run any of its rolling stock north of Houston. Morgan also adapted to the progress of the railroad networks. First, in 1873, he changed his freight tariffs from rates by container volumes to rates per hundred pounds of weight. Second, he had started a plan to bypass Galveston as a logistics center in favor of Houston. Around the same time, he also forwarded his passengers and freight through the Houston Direct Navigation Company, which transferred between coastal steamers to Buffalo Bayou packets in Galveston Bay, thus avoiding the port of Galveston, along with its regulations and fees. Houston Direct Navigation Company ran its steamers from Galveston Bay to the wharf at Houston. Later he bought enough stock in the company to become its largest shareholder, further aligning his interests with Houston and against Galveston.

On July 1, 1874, Morgan forged an agreement with the Ship Channel Company (Houston) to improve navigation of Buffalo Bayou. Morgan agreed to dredge to a depth of nine feet and at least 120-feet in width in exchange for company stock. Less than two years later, he completed a channel through Galveston Bay to an existing channel through the Red Fish Bar, and the final segment terminated about six miles east of Houston, at a place he named Clinton, Texas. He next commissioned the construction of a short line railroad of just over seven miles to network his wharves at Clinton with two Houston railroads: the Houston and Texas Central and the International and Great Northern. When this line started operation on September 11, 1876, Morgan gained access to most of Texas and no longer needed Galveston within his transportation network. Next, he engineered a takeover of the Houston and Texas Central, ousting the all-Texas management, and installing himself as a director with Charles A. Whitney as president.

== Death and legacy ==

Morgan died on May 9, 1878, at his home in New York City after an extended illness as a consequence of Bright&#x27;s disease. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

Morgan&#x27;s incorporation of the eponymous Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company (ML&amp;TRSC) facilitated a division of his estate, delegated to the administration of Charles A. Whitney. In April 1878, just a few weeks prior to his death, Morgan conveyed shares of the company to Mary Jane Sexton Morgan, Maria Louis Morgan Whitney, Frances Eliza Morgan Quintard, Charles A. Whitney, George W. Quintard, and Richard Jessup Morgan (a grandson). Whitney was the president of the company; Alexander C. Hutchinson was the vice-president. Both held proxies from the Morgan family shareholders to manage the company.

The ML&amp;TRSC continued to expand westward, reaching Lafayette by 1879. The company continued to operate under the goals that he established, and it was finally acquired by Southern Pacific Railroad in 1883. The railroad company persisted through 1885. Ultimately the development of the railroads severely diminished the role of coastal steamships; however, the railroad part of the enterprise remained valuable. Collis P. Huntington and Jay Gould emerged as dominant railroad developers in the region. Though Texas law prohibited interstate railroads, Huntington leased Texas railroads to bring them into the Southern Pacific Railroad system. Some of these included segments of the ML&amp;TRSC in Texas and Louisiana.
Morgan&#x27;s legacy is preserved with the 1876 renaming of Brashear to Morgan City, Louisiana, and in the Morgan School, a high school in Clinton, Connecticut, for which Morgan donated land and capital.

<text>The worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) is a small New World warbler that breeds in the Eastern United States and migrates to southern Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America for the winter.

==Taxonomy==
The worm-eating warbler was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla vermivora&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;worm-eater&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;. Edwards had received a specimen from the American naturalist William Bartram that had been collected in Pennsylvania. The worm-eating warbler is now placed in the genus &quot;Helmitheros&quot; that was introduced in 1819 by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;helmins&quot; meaning &quot;worm&quot;, and &quot;-thēras&quot; meaning &quot;hunter&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;vermivorum&quot; is from Latin &quot;vermis&quot; meaning &quot;worm&quot; and &quot;-vorus&quot; meaning &quot;-eating&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The worm-eating warbler is a small New World warbler. It is around in length and weighs . It is relatively plain with olive-brown upperparts and light-coloured underparts, but has black and light brown stripes on its head. It has a slim pointed bill and pink legs. In immature birds, the head stripes are brownish. The male&#x27;s song is a short high-pitched trill. This bird&#x27;s call is a &quot;chip&quot; or &quot;&quot;. Worm-eating warblers are sexually monomorphic. Males and females can only reliably be sexed during the breeding season by the presence of a brood patch in females or a cloacal protuberance in males. These birds are also difficult to age. Hatch year/second year birds have rusty tips on tertials that wear off by March of the following year. Juveniles can be distinguished by duskier head markings, and cinnamon wingbars.

==Distribution and habitat==
These birds breed in the Eastern United States. Their selected habitats vary significantly between populations. In much of their range, worm-eating warblers are associated with mature hardwood forests on steep slopes. However, recent attention has been focused on coastal breeding populations, as little is known about their ecology or status. Historically, coastal populations would select for pocosin ecosystems. More recently, however, these populations have shifted to frequent use of pine plantations. Current use of pine plantations has resulted in densities higher than in areas previously thought to be their natural habitat. This shift in habitat selection likely demonstrates that worm-eating warblers are more closely associated with shrub structure than stand age or size. If this is the case, the landscape changes that occurred on the Atlantic coastal plain may have had less of an impact on these birds than previously described. Maintaining this species habitat may require managing for dense shrubby midstory and understory. Due to their reliance on shrub structure for foraging, and ground nesting behavior, frequent fires have a negative impact on this species. Other management strategies that reduce the shrub mid-story, increase herbaceous growth, and decrease canopy cover are likely to have a similar effect. More information is needed about their breeding habits in coastal regions as these forests are likely to represent different conditions from their inland counterparts. Fat deposits play a key role in allowing for long distance migration in most passerines. Stopover habitat, or areas that allow birds to replenish their fat stores, are also critical.

In winter, these birds migrate to southern Mexico, the Greater Antilles, and Central America particularly along the Caribbean Slope where they occupy both scrub and moist forests. Worm-eating warblers have disappeared from some parts of their range due to habitat loss but their ability to use both scrub and moist forest ecosystems may be beneficial to the long term conservation of this species.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
This bird breeds in dense deciduous forests in the eastern United States, usually on wooded slopes. The nest is an open cup placed on the ground, hidden among dead leaves. It is one of several species of new-world warblers that nests on the ground including the black-and-white warbler (&quot;Mniotilta varia&quot;), the ovenbird (&quot;Seiurus aurocapilla&quot;), the northern waterthrush (&quot;Parkesia noveboracensis&quot;), Louisiana waterthrush (&quot;Parkesia motacilla&quot;), palm warbler (&quot;Setophaga palmarum&quot;), and the Kentucky warbler (&quot;Geothlypis formosa&quot;). The female lays four or five eggs. Both parents feed the young; they may try to distract predators near the nest by pretending to be injured. Worm-eating warblers are often parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;) where forest fragmentation occurs. Reducing forest fragmentation may prove vital if populations of worm-eating warblers suffer large declines.

===Food and feeding===
The diet of worm-eating warblers varies across habitat types. This variation can be attributed to different predator avoidance strategies employed by common prey items. On their breeding grounds, worm-eating warblers glean mostly from live foliage, searching for arthropods. On the wintering grounds, this species gleans insects almost exclusively from dead plant material. The name &quot;worm-eating&quot; refers to the numerous Lepidopteran larvae that this species consumes; they rarely if ever eat earthworms.

Use of pesticides, especially those broadcast over a wide area, is likely to have an effect on most insectivorous songbird species, including the worm-eating warbler. These pesticides decrease the species&#x27; primary food source and could result in long-term toxicity.

<text>Rubén Eloy Hinojosa (born August 20, 1940) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for , from 1997 to 2017. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district stretched from Seguin (east of San Antonio), to McAllen on the Mexican border. Much of the region was rural although Hidalgo County is part of the third-fastest-growing metropolitan statistical area in the country. Hinojosa served on the Financial Services and Education committees.

==Early life and education==

Hinojosa was born in Edcouch, Texas. The eighth of eleven children, Hinojosa was reared in Hidalgo County, which borders on Mexico, and earned two business degrees, a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his MBA from the University of Texas–Pan American.

== Career ==
In 1974, Hinojosa was elected to the Texas State Board of Education, a position which he held for ten years.

Hinojosa&#x27;s father and uncle founded H&amp;H Foods in 1947 as a slaughterhouse. Control of the firm passed in 1976 to himself and his brother, Liborio. He gave up his executive position when he entered Congress, but remained a director and major stockholder.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Education and the Workforce
**Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions
*Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises
**Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit

==Political campaigns==
After 32-year incumbent Kika de la Garza announced his retirement, Hinojosa won a five-way primary for the seat by only 588 votes. This practically assured him of being only the sixth person to represent this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district. He defeated Republican Tom Haughey with 62 percent of the vote. He defeated Haughey again in 1998, winning 59 percent of the vote. In 2000, he took 89 percent of the vote against the Independent Frank L. Jones, III. In 2002, he was unopposed. In 2004, Hinojosa faced Republican Michael Thamm in the redrawn District 15 and defeated the former major, winning 59 percent of the vote. In the 2006 mid-term election he faced Paul Haring and Eddie Zamora, both Republicans. Hinojosa won 61 percent of the vote in the once-again redrawn district.

In the general election held on November 4, 2014, Hinojosa squared off once again with the Republican Eddie Zamora, who received 7,776 votes (54.9 percent) in the primary election held on March 4. Douglas A. &quot;Doug&quot; Carlile (born c. 1963) polled the remaining 6,393 Republican ballots (45.1 percent).

Hinojosa did not seek an eleventh term in the House in 2016. Democrats Vicente Gonzalez and Juan &quot;Sonny&quot; Palacios, Jr., met in the May 24 runoff election to select a successor nominee.

Three Republicans contested the seat in the primary election. Tim Westley, a pastor of Shepherd&#x27;s Vineyard Christian Church in San Antonio who carried the backing of the Tea Party movement, led the field with 13,153 votes (45.3 percent). He faced a runoff on May 24 with Ruben O. Villarreal, who received 9,131 votes (31.5 percent); the third-place candidate, Xavier Salinas, drew a critical 6,730 votes (23.2 percent). Villarreal is the mayor of Rio Grande City, a non-partisan position, in heavily Democratic Starr County.

Three candidates, Democrat Vicente Gonzalez, Republican Tim Westley and Green Vanessa Tijerina, competed in the November 8, 2016, general election for the right to succeed Hinojosa.

In 2016 it was revealed he was one of 9 members of Congress who took a trip secretly funded by the government of Azerbaijan and had to turn over gifts the country gave him to the House Clerk after an ethics investigation.

==Political positions==

Hinojosa has been called a &quot;hard-core liberal&quot; and a &quot;rank-and-file Democrat&quot;. The &#x27;That&#x27;s My Congress&#x27; website has given Hinojosa a &quot;Liberal Action Score&quot; of 37/100 and a &quot;Conservative Action Score&quot; of 16/100 for his votes in the 112th Congress.

During the 111th Congress, Hinojosa voted with his party 99 percent of the time. He voted to extend the Patriot Act and supported the 2011 budget compromise. He voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the American Clean Energy and Security Act, otherwise known as &quot;Cap and Trade&quot;, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Hinojosa has emphasized assisting minorities and low-income Americans gain access to higher education. He has been especially active in supporting water-conservation projects along the Mexican border, and in replacing federal subsidies for student loans with direct government loans. Hinojosa and George Miller were responsible for constructing the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, which increased the maximum Pell Grants available to low-income students and authorized additional funding for minority-serving schools.

He co-sponsored a 2010 bill for enhanced border security, but has opposed the construction of a wall along the border.

He has also been a very strong supporter of free-trade agreements, and was one of 15 House Democrats to vote for the 2005 Central American Free Trade Agreement.

In 2010, Hinojosa supported the introduction of full-body scanners at Valley International Airport. He said that we need to take more precautions when it comes to public safety, and that the new technology &quot;gives TSA employees a distinct advantage in the prevention of terrorist events.&quot;

In June 2011, Hinojosa introduced legislation that would expand the authority of NADBank, which had already funded more than 100 projects to prevent the release of untreated sewage into the Rio Grande and other bodies of water, to finance infrastructure projects designed to enhance economic development along the border and raise environmental standards.

He has also supported measures to aid undocumented workers. He backed the &quot;AgJobs&quot; bill aimed at helping undocumented farm workers. He has been an advocate of the DREAM Act, which would provide citizenship to people who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents. He cited his concern that these children came to the US alongside their parents and should not be faulted. Hinojosa argued that &quot;[o]ur country is much better off by being able to let those children get a college education and serve in the military and contribute to the prosperity of our country.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hinojosa is married to Martha Lopez Hinojosa and they have two daughters, Kaitlin and Karen. He has one son, Ruben Jr., and two daughters from a previous marriage.

===Bankruptcy===
Hinojosa filed for personal bankruptcy in December 2010. He blamed the bankruptcy on a loan made to his family&#x27;s food processing company, H&amp;H Foods that left him owing $2.6 million to Wells Fargo Bank.

<doc id="838681" wikidata="Q1065287" url="?curid=838681" title="Charles Langbridge Morgan">
<text>Charles Langbridge Morgan (22 January 1894 – 6 February 1958) was a British playwright and novelist of English and Welsh parentage. The main themes of his work were, as he himself put it, &quot;Art, Love, and Death&quot;, and the relation between them. Themes of individual novels range from the paradoxes of freedom (&quot;The Voyage&quot;, &quot;The River Line&quot;), through passionate love seen from within (&quot;Portrait in a Mirror&quot;) and without (&quot;A Breeze of Morning&quot;), to the conflict of good and evil (&quot;The Judge&#x27;s Story&quot;) and the enchanted boundary of death (&quot;Sparkenbroke&quot;). He was married to Welsh novelist Hilda Vaughan.

==Life and writings==

===Early life===
His maternal grandparents had emigrated to Australia from Pembrokeshire. His paternal grandparents were from Gloucestershire and Devon in England. His parents were married in Australia. His father, Sir Charles Langbridge Morgan, was a railway civil engineer, and at one time was President of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Morgan himself was born in Bromley, Kent. He was educated at the Naval Colleges of Osborne and Dartmouth and served as a midshipman in the China Fleet until 1913 when he returned to England to take the entrance examinations for Oxford. On the outbreak of war, he rejoined the navy but was sent with Churchill&#x27;s Naval Division to the defence of Antwerp. He was interned in the Netherlands which provided the setting for his best-selling novel &quot;The Fountain&quot;.

Some of his early poems were published in &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;. &quot;To America&quot; (1917) was included in &quot;A Treasury of World Poetry&quot;, edited by George Herbert Clarke. After World War I, he took his degree at Brasenose College, Oxford.

===Family relationships; journalism and drama===
After an unsuccessful relationship with Mary, a daughter of Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett, he married the Welsh novelist Hilda Vaughan in 1923. They had two children: Dame Shirley Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey, and Roger Morgan, who became Librarian of the House of Lords Library. He was the drama critic of &quot;The Times&quot; from the 1920s until 1938, and contributed weekly articles on the London theatre to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He wrote a series of articles for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; under the byline &quot;Menander&#x27;s Mirror&quot; from 1942, and many articles for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

His first play, &quot;The Flashing Stream&quot; (1938), had successful runs in London and Paris but was not well received in New York. &quot;The River Line&quot; (1952) was originally written as a novel in 1949 and concerned the activities of escaped British prisoners of war in France during World War II.

===Honours and reputation===
He was awarded the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 1936, a promotion in 1945, and was elected a member of the Institut de France in 1949. From 1953 to 1956, he was the President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.

While Morgan enjoyed an immense reputation during his lifetime, particularly in France, and was awarded the 1940 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction, he was sometimes criticised for excessive seriousness, and for some time he was rather neglected; he once claimed that the &quot;sense of humour by which we are ruled avoids emotion and vision and grandeur of spirit as a weevil avoids the sun. It has banished tragedy from our theatre, eloquence from our debates, glory from our years of peace, splendour from our wars…&quot; The character Gerard Challis in Stella Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;Westwood&quot; is thought to be a caricature of him. His posthumous reputation was initially higher in France than in Britain, but has begun a new rise in recent years with the republication of various novels (including Capuchin Classics&#x27; &quot;The Voyage&quot; with an Introduction by Oxford&#x27;s Valentine Cunningham in 2009), his poetry (edited by Peter Holland for Scarthin Books in 2008) and an edition of his plays published by Oberon Books in 2013. He was a consummate and committed stylist, from newspaper reviews to major novels a passionate craftsman of English prose. He was also very popular in Italy, especially in the 1950s. He spent long periods in the North, and in Tuscany. He wrote and set Sparkenbroke in Lucca.

===Literary connection===
Morgan employed Esmé Valerie Fletcher as his private secretary when she moved to London from Leeds in her determination to enter London literary circles and find a way to meet T. S. Eliot, her future husband. She acknowledged her gratitude to Morgan for providing her with her first opportunity and later spoke of her respect for him as an author in private discussions with her family and friends.

<doc id="838687" wikidata="Q5181939" url="?curid=838687" title="Cranbourne line">
<text>The Cranbourne line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s second longest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Cranbourne station in the south-east, serving 24 stations via the City Loop, South Yarra, Caulfield, Oakleigh, and Dandenong. The line operates for approximately 20 hours a day (from approximately 4:00 am to around midnight) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 5 to 15 minutes are operated with services every 15–20 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Cranbourne line run with a seven-car formation operated by High Capacity Metro Trains.

The line originally opened in 1888 branching off from the Gippsland line at Dandenong as the South Gippsland line. Services operated as far as Port Albert, with extensive branch lines featuring on the non-electrified network. The line(s) were built to serve the regional townships of Cranbourne, Koo Wee Rup, and Leongatha, amongst others. The line was closed in 1993 after a decline in usage, however, the line was reopened and electrified to Cranbourne in 1995 as part of the &quot;Building Better Cities&quot; program. Significant growth has occurred since its reopening, with proposals to extend the line two stations to Clyde receiving support amongst other works on the corridor.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Cranbourne line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. A $1 billion upgrade of the corridor between Dandenong and Cranbourne is currently under construction, with improvements including the removal of all level crossings, rebuilding stations, and the duplication of of track. Other works taking place have included the replacement of sleepers, the introduction of new signalling technology, the introduction of new rolling stock, and other works associated with the Metro Tunnel project. These projects have improved the quality and safety of the line, and will be completed by the opening of the Metro Tunnel in 2025.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
In 1888, the Cranbourne line (then known as the South Gippsland railway line) began operations, splitting off from the main line to Gippsland at Dandenong with an extension to Cranbourne. The line was progressively extended to Koo Wee Rup, Nyora, and Loch in 1890, Korumburra and Leongatha in 1891, and Welshpool, Alberton, and Port Albert in 1892. From its opening until 2022, the Cranbourne line was fully single tracked from Dandenong to its terminus, and was only electrified upon its reopening in the 1990s.

=== 20th century ===

==== Regional services ====
Throughout the early to mid 20th century, the South Gippsland railway line continued to open additional branch lines, including to Woodside, Barry Beach, Welshpool Jetty, Outtrim, Wonthaggi, and Strzelecki. All of these branch lines ceased their operations between the mid and late 20th century due to a decrease in patronage. On 6 June 1981, passenger services ceased operation to Yarram. In 1984, the line re-opened with services to Leongatha, until its second closure on 24 June 1993. The Barry Beach freight service ceased operations in 1992, with the line beyond Leongatha booked out of service on 30 June 1992, thus, effectively ending all traffic on the line beyond Leongatha. V/Line passenger services continued to Cranbourne till its electrification, with freight operations continuing into the late 1990s with freight services to the Koala siding.

==== Metropolitan services ====

In 1995, the Australian Government launched the &quot;Building Better Cities&quot; program, designed to redevelop Australian cities with better communities and infrastructure. The $27 million project included a rebuilt Dandenong station, a new station in Cranbourne North (Merinda Park station), the introduction of three position signalling, and electrification of the signal tracked corridor. These works resulted in the re-opening of a section of the South Gippsland line to passengers which became known as the Cranbourne Line.

Freight services continued on part of the South Gippsland line till 1998, when services from the Koala Siding were suspended. With these changes, the line became unused beyond Cranbourne. The exception was a tourist railway operation, which commenced operation between Nyora and Leongatha, and later became known as the South Gippsland Railway till its closure in January 2016.
=== 21st century ===

In 2008, a package of works were unveiled to upgrade the Cranbourne line to improve frequencies and the quality of service. A new siding was constructed at Cranbourne, with a capacity of 6 trains, in order to increase frequencies without having to duplicate the line. In addition to the new siding, the $37 million project also brought a major upgrade to Cranbourne station, which included the construction of an enclosed waiting room, new platform shelters, new toilet facilities, formalised paved pedestrian access, an upgraded bus interchange, and increased security.

In 2012, Lynbrook station opened after two years of construction works. The station serves the suburbs of Lynbrook and Lyndhurst, with the station featuring accessible platforms, car parking facilities, and bus stops. In 2014, the level crossing at Springvale Road, Springvale, was removed by lowering the railway into a trench. Prior to this, the level crossing was considered the most dangerous in Victoria. The removal consisted of a trench and the construction of a new premium station at Springvale.

In September 2019, Qube Holdings commenced operating a daily service on a short section of the line, hauling containerised cement to the Kimberly-Clark siding at Dandenong South.

The 2012 Network Development Plan identified the need for a north–south tunnel connecting the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines to the Sunbury line. In 2017, the Metro Tunnel began construction, involving the construction of five new underground stations, twin tunnels, and other associated infrastructure improvements. Leaving the existing Cranbourne line alignment before South Yarra station, new stations will be built at Anzac, Town Hall (with connections to Flinders Street station), State Library (with connections to Melbourne Central), Parkville, and Arden, before continuing onto the Sunbury line. These works will be completed by 2025, and upon completion, will create a singular rail line from Cranbourne and Pakenham to Sunbury and Melbourne Airport (from 2029).

=== Melbourne Airport rail link ===
The Melbourne Airport rail link will involve the construction of a line from Sunshine to a new station at Melbourne Airport. Connected via the Metro Tunnel, services will operate from the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines through the tunnel before splitting off at Sunshine to either Sunbury or Melbourne Airport. Construction of the line will involve the renovation of Sunshine station to allow for additional platforms, construction of new track, and the addition of two new stations at Keilor East and Melbourne Airport. Construction started in 2022 with services expected to begin in 2029.

=== Clyde extension ===
Services on the South Gippsland line were fully suspended in 1981 due to limited passenger numbers on the route. Since the closure, calls have been made to reopen the line to the suburb of Clyde. Reopening of the line to Clyde was first promised by the Australian Labor Party during the 1999 and 2002 state election campaigns, but were dumped before the 2006 election. In November 2003, a &quot;Trainlink&quot; bus service was introduced as an alternative, meeting each train at Cranbourne station and running on a largely one-way loop through Cranbourne East. The Bracks governments Victorian Transport Plan, released in 2008, listed the extensions and associated works as a &quot;medium term&quot; project, which was estimated to cost $200 million. Despite the political promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Bracks-led Labor government in 1999, the project was abandoned in 2008 by his successor John Brumby.

In 2013, as part of Public Transport Victoria&#x27;s Network Development Plan for metropolitan rail, an extension of the Cranbourne line to Clyde was earmarked to begin in the &quot;long-term&quot;, which would equate to at least over the next 20 years. In January 2018, City of Casey advised it would need almost $3 billion worth of rail and road infrastructure projects to continue development of the region, including the extension of the metropolitan train from Cranbourne to Clyde and the duplication of the line between Dandenong and Cranbourne. In the lead up to the 2018 state election, the incumbent Andrews government announced the Cranbourne Line Upgrade, a project involving the duplication of 8 km of track between Dandenong and Cranbourne, a rebuilt Merinda Park station, the construction of a new rail connection for the Port Rail Shuttle Network, and the removal of all remaining level crossings on the corridor. Andrews argued that this project was required if an extension to Clyde was to be constructed. Opposition leader Matthew Guy instead promised that he would extend the Cranbourne line to Clyde if he won the election.

Again in the lead up to the 2022 state election, the City of Casey increased its campaign for the extension of the rail line to Clyde, including the construction of 3 new stations. The City of Casey proposal involved the construction of stations at Cranbourne East, Casey Fields (only proposed by the council), and Clyde. This proposal was supported again by opposition leader Matthew Guy, minus the station at Casey Fields. The incumbent Andrews government made no commitments to the Clyde rail extension, instead continuing construction on the Cranbourne Line Upgrade. The 2022 state election resulted in another Labor victory, with the Andrews government pushing ahead with the Cranbourne Line Upgrade, with the extension to Clyde remaining stagnant ever since.

=== Level Crossing Removals ===
The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of all 15 remaining level crossings on the Cranbourne line, to be completed in stages from 2018 to 2025. All level crossings between Caulfield and Dandenong were removed in 2018 as part of the Caulfield to Dandenong skyrail project. This included the removal of nine level crossings and the reconstruction of five elevated stations along the corridor. The second phase of removals involves removing individual crossings along the corridor through a variety of methods by 2025. Some crossings have been removed through elevating the rail corridor, some by lowering or raising the road, with other crossings being removed by closing the crossing off from motor traffic. These projects will leave the entirety of the Cranbourne line level crossing free by 2025, with projects on the Sunbury line leaving the entire Sunshine-Dandenong corridor crossing free by the opening of the Metro Tunnel in 2025.

=== Cranbourne line upgrade ===

Announced in the lead up to the 2018 Victorian state election, the Cranbourne line would receive a $1 billion upgrade to coincide with the opening of the Metro Tunnel. The project is being delivered by the Level Crossing Removal Project, and will include:

* The removal of the four remaining level crossings (75% complete)
** Evans Road, Lyndhurst (complete)
** Greens Road, Dandenong South (complete)
** Camms Road, Cranbourne (complete)
** Webster Street, Dandenong (gone by 2025)
* The duplication of of single track between Dandenong South and Cranbourne (complete)
* The installation of a second rail bridge at Abbotts Road and Eumemmerring Creek in Dandenong South (complete)
* The reconstruction of Merinda Park station (complete)
* The delivery of a new rail connection for the Port Rail Shuttle Network (underway)

In 2020, the level crossing at Evans Road in Lyndhurst was removed through the construction of a road bridge over the rail line. In early 2021, the first platform of the newly rebuilt Merinda Park station was opened, with the second platform opening a year later. In February 2022, the second platform at Merinda Park was opened along with the completion of duplication works. After the duplication works, the line could now handle 10-minute frequencies during peak periods. As a result, the timetable was rewritten to allow for 50 extra Cranbourne services to operate every week. Alongside the duplication works, all level crossings on the line will be removed. The Cranbourne line is projected to become the first crossing-free line on the network, with the remaining two crossings and other upgrade works expected to be completed by 2025.

==Network and Operations==
=== Services ===
Services on the Cranbourne line operates from approximately 4:00 am to around 11:30 pm daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 5 minutes on the Dandenong corridor (combined with the Pakenham line) and 10 minutes in the AM peak on the Cranbourne line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. Cranbourne line services operate as shuttles to and from Dandenong between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am, connecting with Pakenham line trains. During the peak, some services originate and terminate at Westall or Dandenong. Services run anticlockwise through the City Loop, and from 2025, Cranbourne line services will cease to stop at South Yarra, Richmond, and all City Loop stations when trains are rerouted through the Metro Tunnel upon opening. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours. Since 13 February 2022, some off-peak daytime Cranbourne and Pakenham line services stop at Malvern station, running express between South Yarra and Malvern stations.

Freight operations are limited, with Qube Holdings operating a daily service on a short section of the line hauling containerised cement to the Kimberly-Clark siding at Dandenong South.

Train services on the Cranbourne line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===
The Cranbourne line has had a total of 5 operators since its reopening in 1995. The majority of operations throughout its history have been privately run.

The government-owned Public Transport Corporation and later Bayside Trains operated the line for a short 4 years till the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Cranbourne line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Cranbourne line forms a relatively linear route from the Melbourne CBD to its terminus in Cranbourne. The line is long and predominantly double-tracked; however, between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to 6 tracks between Richmond and South Yarra before again narrowing to 4 tracks between South Yarra and Caulfield. After Caulfield station, the track again narrows to two tracks, which remain for the rest of the route. The only underground section of the Cranbourne line is in the City Loop, where the service stops at 3 underground stations and operates in a counter-clockwise direction. Exiting the city, the Cranbourne line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. However, between South Yarra and Malvern, the rail corridor has been lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings, and between Malvern and Caulfield, the corridor it has been raised on an embankment for the same reason. After Caulfield, the line formerly had numerous level crossings; all have now been abolished between Caulfield and Dandenong as part of an elevated rail project, as well as some older bridges over and under roads. The remaining crossing will be fully removed by 2025.

The line follows the same alignment as the Pakenham line along the Gippsland line, with the two services splitting onto different routes at Dandenong. The Cranbourne line turns south and branches on to the South Gippsland line, while the Pakenham line continues along the Gippsland line. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas, but after Dandenong, the line gets into a mix of both open fields and suburbia. This outer portion of the line is one of Melbourne&#x27;s main growth corridors, which is rapidly replacing farmland with housing and commercial developments, adding additional passengers to the line each year.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 24 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. From 2025, services will cease to stop at Flinders Street, Southern Cross, Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, Parliament, Richmond, and South Yarra stations due to the opening of the Metro Tunnel. 


==== Planned stations ====
== Infrastructure ==
=== Rolling stock ===

The Cranbourne line uses a fleet of electric multiple unit (EMU) High Capacity Metro Trains operating in a seven-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate of up to 1,380 passengers in each train-set. Shared with the Pakenham, Sunbury, and Airport lines, the rolling stock will consist of 70 High Capacity Metro Trains (HCMT), once fully delivered. They are built in Changchun, China, with final assembly occurring in Newport, Melbourne, by Evolution Rail, a consortium composed of CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles, Downer Rail and Plenary Group.

Previously, the Cranbourne line was served by a fleet of Comeng and Siemens Nexas trains. The oldest Comeng trains (stage 1 and some stage 2) have been retired and scrapped as part of the HCMT introduction, however, some of these trains have been displaced onto other Melbourne metropolitan lines.

Alongside the passenger trains, Cranbourne line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, individual station upgrade projects, and associated Metro Tunnel works. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 66% of Cranbourne line stations classed as fully accessible. This number is expected to grow within the coming years, as a network restructure associated with the opening of the Metro Tunnel is completed by 2025.

=== Signalling ===

Since its re-opening in 1995, the Cranbourne line had used a fixed-block, three-position signalling system designed for lower frequencies and less services. However, the ageing system had undermined reliability due to the presence of system faults and limited frequencies, requiring the Cranbourne, Pakenham, and Sunbury lines to upgrade their signalling system. Since 2021, high-capacity signalling (HCS) has been rolling out on the Pakenham, Cranbourne, and Sunbury lines, allowing trains to safely run closer together and run more frequently. The new system is being delivered by CPB Contractors and Bombardier Transportation under the Rail Systems Alliance. These works valued at $1 billion includes the roll-out of of HCS and communications systems on the aforementioned lines, allowing an increase in reliability and frequency. The line will be equipped with Bombardier&#x27;s CityFlo 650 communications-based train control system, which will enable operation at 2–3 minute headways.

The upgrade works were completed in phases from 2021. With the upgraded signalling system, trains are now able to run closer to each other. The new system was tested on the Mernda line and a section of the Cranbourne line before being fully implemented. In March 2022, the Cranbourne line underwent further testing of high-tech signalling equipment, to ensure the new trains and signalling system can safely run alongside older-generation trains—including freight and V/Line trains—and the existing signalling system.

<text>The King of Torts (2003) is a legal/suspense novel written by American author John Grisham. Doubleday published the first edition () in hardcover format; it immediately debuted at #1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, remaining in the top 15 for over 20 weeks. Dell Publishing published the paperback edition later in 2003 (). Penguin Random House released an audiobook version in 2007.

==Plot==
Clay Carter, a public defender in Washington, D.C., reluctantly takes on the case of Tequila Watson, a man accused of a random street killing. Watson insists that he somehow was not in control of his body when he pulled the trigger, a story which Clay tries to dismiss but cannot get out of his mind. Clay tries his best to help Watson, venturing into the capital&#x27;s most dangerous slums in search of evidence. Clay finally gets a subpoena forcing drug rehabilitation centers to hand over Watson&#x27;s medical records, as well as those of another man accused of a similar murder.

Meanwhile, Clay is dating Rebecca Van Horn, a junior congressional aide, but deeply loathes her father, real estate developer Bennett Van Horn, an aggressive real estate mogul. When Clay refuses an offer to work for a senator who is closely involved with Bennett&#x27;s land deals in Northern Virginia, Bennett pressures Rebecca into ending her relationship with Clay.

Clay is contacted by a mysterious man named Max Pace, who tells him that Watson&#x27;s records are evidence of a scandal. It is revealed that Watson and other recovering addicts were illegally given an experimental drug called Tarvan, which caused them to behave violently. Pace says he has been hired by the drug company responsible, asking Clay to resign from his job as a public defender and arrange secret payoffs to the victims. While doing so would mean hiding exculpatory evidence from Watson, Clay goes along with the scheme, partly to win back Rebecca&#x27;s affections with his newfound wealth.

Clay opens a law firm specializing in mass torts, hiring several friends and colleagues: lawyer Paulette, paralegal Rodney and computer expert Jonah. He continues to work with Max, who provides insider information concerning Dyloft, a carcinogenic drug produced by Ackerman Laboratories. Advised by Max, Clay orchestrates an intensive TV campaign which results in a $100 million settlement, being dubbed the &quot;King of Torts&quot; by the press. While Clay and his firm enjoy a massive windfall from the settlement, his clients are bitter at getting only a bit more than $50,000 each.

Max offers Clay information on yet another defective drug called Maxatil. Expecting to repeat his success, Clay recklessly incurs enormous expenses: launching a coast-to-coast TV campaign; signing up dozens of additional staff; renting additional office space; and signing up thousands of &quot;Maxatil clients.&quot; However, Clay finds that conclusively linking Maxatil to negative side effects is far from easy. Moreover, it is produced by Goffman, a company known for their unwillingness to compromise on tort suits. The future of the Maxatil suit depends on the outcome of a single, long drawn out test case run by an aging maverick lawyer in Arizona.

Meanwhile, the FBI questions Clay on suspicion of insider trading. A criminal lawyer tells Clay that, having sold Ackerman shares short while knowing he would sue the company and push down the value of its shares, he is indeed culpable and could face prison. Max turns out to be a wanted con artist who has disappeared without a trace. Then, after Dyloft&#x27;s effects are found to be deadlier than first thought, terminal patients who were kept from suing Ackerman for millions instead sue Clay for malpractice. Clay faces the prospect of being forced to consume all of his assets to pay his former clients.

Desperate for money, Clay turns to a mass tort against Hanna, a building supplies company which had produced batches of defective cement. The company&#x27;s directors are willing to offer a fair compensation to disgruntled homeowners, but only if Clay agrees to cut his share of the compensations. Clay refuses, resulting in Hanna&#x27;s bankruptcy, the loss of thousands of jobs and an economic disaster for the town where the company is based. When it becomes known that the collapse was caused by &quot;a greedy lawyer,&quot; Clay is ambushed and beaten by some of the townsfolk.

Rebecca unexpectedly appears during Clay&#x27;s recovery. Regaining her love helps him calmly take the final blow to his career: the jury in Arizona rejects the Maxatil suit, and all the millions which Clay invested in Maxatil goes down the drain. Clay is forced to declare bankruptcy, close down firm, give up his assets and surrender his law license. The FBI stops pursuing their case against Clay due to the loyalty of an old friend who refuses to provide incriminating evidence.

With nothing more to lose, Clay discloses his involvement in the Tarvan affair to an investigative journalist; a criminal lawyer will attempt to re-open the cases of the Tarvan test subjects, including Watson. Clay and Rebecca fly to London, where they would have a happy life without the opulence Clay no longer misses. It is, however, implied that Clay will still end up with a few million dollars in the end, because Paulette and Rodney—with whom Clay was extremely generous and loyal in distributing his initial settlements—both promise to return some of the money to him, never forgetting that they owe their financial success to him.

<text>Radovan () was a Croatian sculptor and architect who lived in Trogir in the 13th century. In Croatian he is commonly referred to as &quot;&quot; or &quot;Master Radovan&quot;. Virtually no information exists about the personality and career of this artist, save for his monumental Romanesque portal of the Trogir cathedral.

Radovan inscribed his name and the year of the making of the main portal, 1240, on the lunette above the entrance:
The text informs us that master Radovan was the best in the art of sculpture and that the project was completed at the time when a Tuscan, Treguan from Florence, had been the bishop of Trogir.

That Radovan was a native son of Trogir &quot;(Traù)&quot; is attested, among other things, by his name, which figures frequently in Trogir&#x27;s municipal archives in the 13th century.

The portal consists of four parts: on the doorjamb, the nude figures of Adam and Eve, supported by lions; inside are numerous reliefs depicting the Labors of the Months as well as hunting scenes; and finally in the middle are scenes from the life of Christ: from the Annunciation to the Resurrection – positioned in arches around the tympanum. Finally, in tympanum is the Birth of Christ. The figures are very realistic, recalling French Gothic sculpture, including the sculpture at Chartres Cathedral.

<text>Eugène Louis Boudin (; 12 July 1824 – 8 August 1898) was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was a marine painter, and expert in the rendering of all that goes upon the sea and along its shores. His pastels, summary and economic, garnered the splendid eulogy of Baudelaire; and Corot called him the &quot;King of the skies&quot;.

==Biography==

Born at Honfleur, Boudin was the son of a harbor pilot, and at age 10 the young boy worked on a steamboat that ran between Le Havre and Honfleur. In 1835 the family moved to Le Havre, where Boudin&#x27;s father opened a store for stationery and picture frames. Here the young Eugene worked, later opening his own small shop. Boudin&#x27;s father had thus abandoned seafaring, and his son gave it up too, having no real vocation for it, though he preserved to his last days much of a sailor&#x27;s character: frankness, accessibility, and open-heartedness.

In his shop, in which pictures were framed, Boudin came into contact with artists working in the area and exhibited in the shop the paintings of Constant Troyon and Jean-François Millet, who, along with Jean-Baptiste Isabey and Thomas Couture whom he met during this time, encouraged young Boudin to follow an artistic career. At the age of 22 he abandoned the world of commerce, started painting full-time, and travelled to Paris the following year and then through Flanders. In 1850 he earned a scholarship that enabled him to move to Paris, where he enrolled as a student in the studio of Eugène Isabey and worked as a copyist at the Louvre. To supplement his income he often returned to paint in Normandy and, from 1855, made regular trips to Brittany. On 14 January 1863 he married the 28-year-old Breton woman Marie-Anne Guédès in Le Havre and set up home in Paris.
Dutch 17th-century masters profoundly influenced him, and on meeting the Dutch painter Johan Jongkind, who had already made his mark in French artistic circles, Boudin was advised by his new friend to paint outdoors (&quot;en plein air&quot;). He also worked with Troyon and Isabey, and in 1859 met Gustave Courbet who introduced him to Charles Baudelaire, the first critic to draw Boudin&#x27;s talents to public attention when the artist made his debut at the 1859 Paris Salon.

In 1857/58 Boudin befriended the young Claude Monet, then only 17, and persuaded him to give up his teenage caricature drawings and to become a landscape painter, helping to instil in him a love of bright hues and the play of light on water later evident in Monet&#x27;s Impressionist paintings. The two remained lifelong friends and Monet later paid tribute to Boudin&#x27;s early influence. Boudin joined Monet and his young friends in the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1873, but never considered himself a radical or innovator. 

Both Boudin and Monet lived abroad during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Boudin in Antwerp and Monet in London; from 1873 to 1880 the Boudins lived in Bordeaux. His growing reputation enabled him to travel extensively at that time, visiting Belgium, the Netherlands and southern France. He continued to exhibit at the Paris Salons, receiving a third place medal at the Paris Salon of 1881, and a gold medal at the 1889 Exposition Universelle. In 1892 Boudin was made a knight of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, a somewhat tardy recognition of his talents and influence on the art of his contemporaries.

Late in his life, after the death of his wife in 1889, Boudin spent every winter in the south of France as a refuge from his own poor health, and from 1892 to 1895 made regular trips to Venice. In 1898, recognizing that his life was almost spent, he returned to his home at Deauville, to die on 8 August within sight of the English Channel and under the Channel skies he had painted so often. He was buried according to his wishes in the Saint-Vincent Cemetery in Montmartre, Paris.

<text>OLAC, the Open Language Archives Community, is an initiative to create a unified means of searching online databases of language resources for linguistic research. The information about resources is stored in XML format for easy searching. OLAC was founded in 2000, and is hosted at the Linguistic Data Consortium webserver at the University of Pennsylvania.

OLAC advises on best practices in language archiving, and works to promote interoperation between language archives.

== Metadata ==
The OLAC metadata set is based on the complete set of Dublin Core metadata terms DCMT, but the format allows for the use of extensions to express community-specific qualifiers. It is often contrasted to IMDI (ISLE Metadata Initiative).

=== Attributes ===
The OLAC metadata is based on five primary attributes, &quot;refine, code, scheme, lang,&quot; and &quot;langs&quot;, although the last attribute is only for completed metadata sets. Each attribute serves a different function and is applicable in a different section of the metadata. 
=== Elements ===
There are currently 23 different elements that OLAC lists on its metadata page. Elements may be used more than once, and not every element is required in a metadata submission. Each element&#x27;s entry on the official OLAC page includes the name of the element, its function, notes on its usage, and examples of its coding.

In addition, OLAC provides a list of metadata extensions to augment descriptions.

<doc id="838721" wikidata="Q277572" url="?curid=838721" title="Dresden TV tower">
<text>The Fernsehturm Dresden-Wachwitz is a TV tower in Dresden, Germany. It is situated on the &quot;Wachwitzer Elbhöhen&quot; and serves as a transmitting tower for television and radio broadcasts. Due to its visibility over large distances and its unusual form, it has become a landmark of Dresden and the Elbe Valley. Its address is 37 Oberwachwitzer Way, Dresden.

==Construction==
The architects of the Dresdner TV tower were Kurt Nowotny, Hermann Rühle and Johannes Braune. Built between 1963 and 1969, its cup-like design was inspired by a sparkling wine glass. It is 252 metres high and is the second highest building in the former GDR after the Berlin TV tower, which is 368 metres high. The tip of the building towers approximately 373 metres above the Elbe river level and the foot is 230 metres above sea level. The shank of the building consists of reinforced concrete and has a diameter of 21 metres, which is buried underground to a depth of six metres in Lusatian granite. The total weight of the tower amounts to 7300 tonnes.

==Radio engineering==
On September 18, 1969, radio transmissions were started from the tower. It possesses four transmission mechanisms for VHF broadcasts and three transmitters for television. In 2003, a small fire occurred in the transmitting rooms, which was quickly brought under control.

=====Historical broadcasts=====

East German television (DFF) was transmitted from the tower between 1969 and 1990. The first programme (DFF/DDR-FS/DDR1/DFF1) was on channel 10, with the second programme (DFF2/DDR2) broadcasting on channel 29 from 1972. DFF2/DDR2 broadcast in SECAM colour. This was deliberately different from the West German PAL standard, so East German residents could not watch West German broadcasts in colour. In practice, however, few East Germans owned colour sets, and reception of both standards was possible in black-and-white.

Dresden, because of its location in a valley, was one of the few areas of East Germany (and the only major city in the country) that could not receive the broadcast of West Germany&#x27;s ARD (now known as Das Erste) from either Ochsenkopf or West Berlin, despite the best efforts of West German broadcasters to cover the whole of the East. This led to Dresden and the surrounding area being called &quot;Tal der Ahnungslosen&quot; (&quot;The Valley of the Clueless&quot;), because its citizens only had access to the propaganda of East Germany. ARD was said to stand for &quot;Außer (&quot;except&quot;) Rügen und Dresden&quot; or rather &quot;Außer Raum Dresden&quot; (&quot;except/outside of Dresden area&quot;).

The two East German programmes were replaced upon reunification by ARD and MDR Fernsehen, respectively, with ZDF broadcasts commencing on channel 46. All analogue transmissions of public stations from the tower ended on 22 July 2007. Analogue transmission of the commercial networks, which began with reunification, ended at different times. Broadcasts of RTL on channel 43 ended in 1995, when it was replaced by VOX. This was followed by the switchoff of Sat.1 on channel 48 in 2002, and finally VOX in 2004.

==Tourism==

Until its renovation in 1991 by Deutsche Telekom (German Telecom) and the closing-down of the GDR state-owned company which ran the HO Restaurant, the public could reach the tower by two elevators. Within the public area was a two-story restaurant with 132 seats at a height of 145 metres and above that was an observation platform. The renovations of the elevators, for a second escape route, for air conditioning and building services, catering and parking would cost 8 million euros. It is estimated that an economical enterprise would only be possible with 500,000 visitors per year.

<text>Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona is a communications tower built in 1980–1984 near Basel, Switzerland, on the territory of the municipality Bettingen, Basel-Stadt.

It was built as a replacement for a tall lattice tower, which was erected at the site in 1962. This lattice tower was once a part of the famous Beromünster transmitter.

The tower is tall – a steel antenna on a concrete base – and not generally accessible for the public, although guided visits can be booked. Apart from television, FM radio and DAB transmitters, and microwave relays, the tower also contains meteorological instruments, two drinking water tanks, and a meeting/conference room near the top of the concrete structure.

== Architecture ==
The television tower St Chrischona shows some architecturally specific features. It features a &quot;3-leg-construction&quot;, in contrast to most other television towers nearby. It has an aerodynamic shape; with a round shaft, the wind from both sides splits and causes, at the rear, an effect that keeps the tower from swaying too strongly. The lower part is star-shaped, and the tower at the apex sways up to even with strong winds. The &quot;Antennenspitze&quot; (round construction method), can sway up to . The microwave radio relay antennas are of a height between . VHF antennas are high.

On the north side is a construction similar to a &quot;backpack&quot; which has a height of ; and two drinking water tanks that are high that contain water supplies for the municipality of Bettingen. During the construction, the weight of the water had to be included in the tension of the tower, which is why it stood southwardly inclined before the completion.

The tower stands on a base construction which includes three basements which accommodate company / technical equipment. As the location of the tower lies in the seismic zone of Basel – Erdbebengebiet in the Upper Rhine district, this has been built especially securely about the base. The tower should remain stable in an earthquake up to 8 on the Richter scale.

The television tower was under construction from July 1980 until December 1983, and was put into operation on 2 August 1984. It replaced a tall steel radio tower that was built in 1962 in Beromünster, where it carried an antenna for medium wave transmission, like today&#x27;s backup broadcasting tower. St Chrischona has been in use since 1954, as a broadcasting tower that was tall at that time which transferred Swiss television programmes. Today&#x27;s tower of St Chrischona carries broadcasting antennas for Swiss Radio (DRS) and &quot;Southwest German Radio&quot; (SWR). Due to the unique construction, it is said that the tower could remain standing during the high winds of a hurricane, where wind speeds appear up to 220 km/h, with an oscillation of only .

<doc id="838731" wikidata="Q1535089" url="?curid=838731" title="Goldenberg scandal">
<text>The Goldenberg scandal was a political scandal where the Kenyan government was found to have subsidised exports of gold far beyond standard arrangements during the 1990s, by paying the company Goldenberg International 35% more (in Kenyan shillings) than their annual foreign currency earnings. Although it notionally appears that the scheme was intended to earn hard currency for the country, it is estimated to have cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10% of the country&#x27;s annual gross domestic product, and it is possible that no or minimal amounts of gold were actually exported. The scandal appears to have involved political corruption at the highest levels of the government of Daniel Arap Moi. Officials in the former government of Mwai Kibaki have also been implicated.

==Background==
Similar to most countries, Kenya encourages international trade by granting tax-free status to commercial enterprises involved in the export of goods and sometimes subsidises these exports. The Goldenberg scandal was based on the fact that exporters who deposited US$ earnings with the Kenya central bank received in exchange the equivalent in Kenyan shillings plus 20 percent.

However, gold mining represented a tiny portion of Kenya&#x27;s GDP, with only one operational gold mine (at Kakamega). Goldenberg International therefore developed a scheme of smuggling gold into Kenya from Congo, so that they could legally export it at the higher export price offered by the Kenyan government.

==Details==
The chief architect behind the scheme was a relative of the Kenyan businessman Kamlesh Pattni. However, it was Pattni who established Goldenberg International to implement the scheme. Almost all the politicians in the Moi government and a considerable percentage of the Kibaki government have been accused. The judicial system also appears to have been deeply involved, with twenty-three of Kenya&#x27;s senior judges resigning after evidence indicated their involvement.

The scheme began in 1991, almost immediately after the Kenya government, following directions from the IMF, introduced measures to reform the economy and increase international trade and investment, and seems to have stopped in 1993 when it was exposed by a whistleblower, David Munyakei. As a result of this, Munyakei was fired from his position at the Central Bank of Kenya, and remained largely unemployed until his death in 2006. There have been two investigations on the scam, one under the Moi government and the other under the Kibaki&#x27;s government. The gold, if there was any, was likely imported from Democratic Republic of the Congo.

==Bosire report==
On 3 February 2006, following an investigation under the Kibaki government, a report by Justice Bosire recommended that the Education Minister at that time, George Saitoti, should face criminal charges for his actions and that former President Daniel arap Moi should be further investigated. Saitoti was both vice-president and finance minister under Moi in the early 1990s. On 13 February, Saitoti&#x27;s resignation was announced by President Kibaki in a television address.

The Bosire report found that KSh.158.3 billion/= of Goldenberg money was transacted with 487 companies and individuals. A list of exhibits compiled by the commission placed Goldenberg International Ltd at the top of the primary recipients of the money, at KSh.35.3 billion/=. The directors of Goldenberg were named as Pattni and James Kanyotu. Although Kanyotu was the director of the Special Branch (intelligence unit of the Kenya Police, now known as National Intelligence Services, NIS) and a director of First American Bank, he described himself as a farmer in Goldenberg documents. President Moi was named by Pattni as having been a shareholder of GIL by nominee. However, President Moi himself was never called to present evidence despite this alleged link.

===Cost===
In response to a query by Joseph Lekuton, on 16 December 2008, Orwa Ojode the Assistant Minister for Provincial Administration and Internal Security confirmed to parliament that the commission had cost the Kenya Government Kshs 511,569,409.90.

===Travel restrictions===
Shortly after, Saitoti along with 20 several others suspected to be involved in the scandal were prohibited from leaving the country and ordered to surrender any weapons they possessed. Among those named were

* Gideon Moi, retired President Moi&#x27;s son, also the Baringo Central MP

* Former Treasury permanent secretary Charles Mbindyo
* former Treasury permanent secretary Wilfred Karuga Koinange

Former president Moi himself was not listed.

The Law Society of Kenya chairman Tom Ojienda criticised Police Commissioner Hussein Ali&#x27;s move to seize travel documents. He described the decisions as &quot;a total violation of the law and the Constitution&quot;. Ojienda regretted that individuals had been charged, tried and convicted by the court of public opinion and the media or through political statements. He commended three Cabinet ministers who resigned to pave way for investigations into the Anglo Leasing and Goldenberg scandals. &quot;The resignation of three members of Cabinet signifies the maturity of our democracy, where leaders whose reputations are besmirched would opt to resign pending investigations to clear their names rather than hold the Government hostage. Such resignations are no pointers to guilt.&quot;

==Prosecution==
Two transactions stand out – one for KSh.5.8 billion/= from the Central Bank to Goldenberg International in 1993, personally authorised by then-president Daniel Arap Moi, and another for KSh.13.5 billion/=. The then CID director Joseph Kamau told reporters on 9 March 2006 that files on Pattni, Kanyotu, Koinange, Kotut, Bii, Riungu and Werunga had been passed to attorney-general Amos Wako. Wako has been attorney-general since 1991, when Moi was in power.

Wako is recommending that the country&#x27;s chief justice consider overturning a previous court order exempting Mr Saitoti from prosecution. All except Werunga are to be charged. The prosecution hopes that Werunga will be their witness.

In August 2006, it was reported that a constitutional court had ruled that Saitoti could not be charged. The Kenyan media reacted negatively to the decision. The Kenya Times saw political motives behind it, while The Daily Nation editorialised that the &quot;War on graft is, indeed, lost&quot;.

<text>The Pilatus P-2 is a trainer aircraft designed and produced by Swiss aircraft manufacturer Pilatus.

The development of the P-2 originates in the first half of the Second World War, during which time Pilatus has attempted to secured a production licence for existing Italian and German trainers before opting to design its own trainer aircraft instead. During 1943, construction of the first prototype commenced; it performed its maiden flight on 27 April 1945. A second prototype was also produced, which was subject to a formal evaluation by the Swiss Air Force before the P-2 was formally produced by the service.

The P-2 was operated by the Swiss Air Force between 1946 and 1981. The majority of the surviving aircraft were sold onto the civilian sector, where they have been often been painted in Luftwaffe markings to appear at both films and airshows alike. The P-2 is fully capable of performing aerobatic maneuvers, although its Argus As 410A-2 V-12 engine is known for being somewhat temperamental and has contributed to some incidents. Various components of the P-2 were sourced from other contemporary aircraft flown by the Swiss Air Force, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109.

==Design and development==
The origins of the P-2 can be traced back to the early years of Pilatus and the firm&#x27;s desire to produce trainer aircraft for the Swiss Air Force. Amid the opening years of the Second World War, Pilatus had repeatedly attempted to obtain a licence to produce both Italian and German training aircraft, however, these endeavours proved to be fruitless. As an alternative, the company opted to develop its own military trainer. A key influence on the project was the Pilatus P-1, a single-seat aircraft that had been designed by the firm but never produced. By late 1943, work had progressed to the point where construction of the first prototype could commence.

The P-2 is a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction (metal, wood and fabric) with a fully retractable tailwheel undercarriage and dual control tandem seating. As an economic measure, several components were identical to existing aircraft operated by the Swiss Air Force, such as elements of the landing gear being sourced from the Messerschmitt Bf 109. There were two series of production machines, one (P-2-05) unarmed and the second (P-2-06) equipped as weapons trainers, with a machine gun above the engine and wing racks for light bombs and rockets. The aircraft is suitable for performing a variety of aerobatic maneuvers.

It is powered by a single Argus As 410A-2 V-12 inverted piston engine, which is capable of producing up to 465 hp. These engines were originally imported from neighbouring Nazi Germany. They are not considered to be particularly durable engine and have a tendency for connecting rod and piston failures. Proper operation of the Argus engine involved both delicate handling and smooth power changes, which was typical of engines designed during the 1930s.

During 1946, after the successful completion of trials using the second prototype, the Swiss Air Force placed an initial order for 26 P-2.05 aircraft. Furthermore, a second batch of twenty-five P-2.06 aircraft were produced and delivered to the Swiss Air Force between December 1949 and September 1950. The P-2 remained in service with the Swiss Air Force until 1981. The type was succeeded by the Pilatus P-3 and the Pilatus PC-7.

After the type&#x27;s withdrawal from service by the Swiss Air Force, most of the surviving aircraft (roughly around 48) were sold to the civil sector. During 2008, at least 23 appeared on the national registers of Switzerland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. They proved to be a popular civil flyer&#x27;s airplane and have often appeared in Luftwaffe markings in films and airshows as an unidentified &quot;enemy&quot; aircraft.

<doc id="838735" wikidata="Q7727869" url="?curid=838735" title="The Courtship of Miles Standish">
<text>The Courtship of Miles Standish is an 1858 narrative poem by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow about the early days of Plymouth Colony, the colonial settlement established in America by the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims.

==Overview==


&quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; is set in the year 1621 against the backdrop of a fierce Indian war and focuses on a love triangle among three Mayflower passengers: Miles Standish, Priscilla Mullins, and John Alden. Longfellow claimed the story was rooted in family tradition, yet there is a complete absence of historical evidence to support its major elements.

==Fictionalized history==
A debate persists as to whether the tale is fact or fiction. Main characters Miles Standish, John Alden, and Priscilla Mullins are based upon real &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers. Longfellow was a descendant of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins through his mother Zilpah Wadsworth. Skeptics dismiss his narrative as a folktale. At minimum, Longfellow used poetic license, condensing several years of events. Scholars have confirmed the cherished place of romantic love in Pilgrim culture, and have documented the Indian war described by Longfellow. Miles Standish and John Alden were likely roommates in Plymouth; Priscilla Mullins was the only single woman of marriageable age in the young colony at that time and did in fact marry Alden. Standish&#x27;s first wife, Rose Handley, died aboard the Mayflower in January 1621. Two years later, Standish married a woman named Barbara in Plymouth in 1623. The Standish and Alden families both moved from Plymouth to adjacent Duxbury, Massachusetts in the late 1620s, where they lived in close proximity, intermarried, and remained close for several generations. Upon his death in 1656, Standish&#x27;s widow, Barbara, appointed John Alden to take inventory of Standish&#x27;s estate.

==Composition and publication history==
The first reference to the poem recorded in Longfellow&#x27;s journal is dated December 29, 1857, where the project is referred to as &quot;Priscilla&quot;. By March 1 the next year, it was renamed &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot;.

The ballad was very popular in nineteenth-century America. It was published in book form on October 16, 1858, and it sold 25,000 copies after two months. Reportedly, 10,000 copies were sold in London in a single day.

Standish is memorialized in a low relief sculpture of six characters from Longfellow&#x27;s epic poems executed by Daniel Chester French and installed at Longfellow Park, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, located in front of Longfellow&#x27;s former home, now a U.S. National Historic Site maintained by the National Park Service.

==Poetic meter==
&quot;Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; is written in dactylic hexameter, the same meter used in classical epic poetry such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Longfellow used the same meter in his poem &quot;Evangeline&quot;.

== Cultural references ==
The story of Standish, Alden, and Mullins is referenced in &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; 

Elements of the story were written into the Rankin/Bass special The Mouse on the Mayflower.

A 1940 Merrie Melodies cartoon depicts their own version of the story in &quot;The Hardship of Miles Standish&quot;. The Krazy Kat episode &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Regress&quot; depicts a comedic version of the story.

Subject of a radio play called &#x27;The Courtship of Miles Standish.&#x27; It was broadcast on November 23, 1949 on Family Theater on the Mutual Broadcasting System, episode 145.

<text>The leather pride flag is a symbol of leather subculture as well as kink and fetish subcultures more broadly, including BDSM. The flag was designed by Tony DeBlase in 1989.

== History ==
The leather pride flag was designed by Tony DeBlase in Chicago, Illinois. DeBlase explained his decision to create the flag:For the 20th anniversary of Stonewall, I felt that the time was right for the Leather men and women who have been participating in these same parades and events more and more visibly in recent years to have a similar simple, elegant banner that would serve as a symbol of their own identity and interests.

DeBlase described the flag design as follows:
The flag is composed of nine horizontal stripes of equal width. From the top and from the bottom, the stripes alternate black and royal blue. The central stripe is white. In the upper left quadrant of the flag is a large red heart.
DeBlase had no specific symbolism in mind when he designed the flag. He once said, &quot;I will leave it to the viewer to interpret the colors and symbols.&quot;

DeBlase first presented the flag at International Mr. Leather (IML) on May 28, 1989. He considered the flag to be a first draft and expected the community would suggest changes to the design. While some community members wanted a say in the final design, the majority embraced DeBlase&#x27;s original design as-is. To this day, the flag has not undergone any significant revisions.In June 1989, the flag was used by the leather contingent in a Portland, Oregon pride parade, which was its first appearance at a pride parade.

By 1990, IML had incorporated the flag&#x27;s design into the sash awarded to IML contest winners.

In 1991, Melbourne Leather Men became the first club to incorporate the design elements of the leather pride flag into their club colors.

On December 12, 2000, NLA Florida presented a suggested pledge of allegiance to the leather pride flag at its holiday party in Fort Lauderdale, which reads, &quot;I pledge allegiance to the Leather Pride flag, and the union of Leather people for which it stands, with safety, sanity and consent for all.&quot;

For the 24th annual Folsom Street Fair, held September 30, 2007, the official poster artwork was a controversial photo featuring well-known LGBT and BDSM community members in festive and fetish attire including Sister Roma &quot;as players in an innovative version of the culturally iconographic&quot; &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, complete with table draped with the leather pride flag and &quot;cluttered with sex toys, whips, and various (BDSM) restraints&quot;. The image by FredAlert was used on the official event guide and produced as collector&#x27;s posters that were displayed throughout the city as advertising for the event.

In 2010 DeBlase was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

==Significance==
Although the flag is common in the gay leather community, it is not an exclusively gay symbol, but rather for the entire leather community and fetish subcultures.

In 2019, the Schwules Museum remarked on the flag&#x27;s impact:The Leather Pride flag is at the beginning of a long line of similar flags, marking a turning point in the history of the mostly gay leather and BDSM movements: moving away from secret signs and symbols (hanky cloths, for example) to more obvious and public visibility, both in the gay scene and society in general.
== Notable flags ==

=== Original flag (Chicago) ===
One of the three original flags that DeBlase assembled was donated to the Leather Archives &amp; Museum (LA&amp;M), where it is on public display. LA&amp;M also holds DeBlase&#x27;s papers.
=== Twin Cities Pride (Minnesota) ===
Since 1998, the Twin Cities Pride parade in Minnesota has featured a &quot;curb-to-curb and a block long&quot; leather pride flag measuring approximately 75 x 50 feet. The first such flag was donated to LA&amp;M in 2008.

=== San Francisco Armory ===
In 2006, fetish pornography studio Kink.com bought the San Francisco Armory building. The company flew the leather pride flag atop the armory and featured imagery of the flag atop the armory in the intro to many of its videos.

=== Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District (San Francisco) ===
The leather pride flag is featured throughout San Francisco&#x27;s Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District. The San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, which opened in 2017, features the flag as well as metal bootprints honoring DeBlase, among other important members of the city&#x27;s leather community. Since 2023, a 20 x 30 foot leather pride flag has flown 80 feet high above Eagle Plaza (adjacent to the San Francisco Eagle).

== Variations ==
Although Tony DeBlase is quoted as saying the design of the leather pride flag, which he created, is copyrighted in the U.S. (as well as all countries where the Berne Convention standards apply), copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been produced as a tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce their exclusive rights.

Nevertheless, variations on the original leather pride flag have been created. On September 18, 1990, Clive Platman (Mr. Australia &quot;Drummer&quot;) presented Tony DeBlase with an Australian version of the flag, incorporating the southern cross featured on the flag of Australia, with the original design of the leather pride flag. On October 11, 1991, at the opening ceremonies of Living in Leather, a Canadian version of the leather pride flag was presented, which added to the original flag&#x27;s design a row of red maple leaves running horizontally through the white stripe.

Leather &amp; Grace, a (now defunct) organization of Unitarian Universalist kinksters, founded in 2011, combined a red flaming chalice with the stripes of the leather pride flag for their logo.
The BDSM rights flag, designed by Tanos, a Master from the United Kingdom, is partially loosely based on the design of the leather pride flag and also includes a version of the BDSM Emblem (but not similar enough to fall within Steve Quagmyr&#x27;s specific copyright claims for the Emblem). The BDSM rights flag is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include BDSM practices deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.

<doc id="838743" wikidata="Q1607373" url="?curid=838743" title="Vidhu Vinod Chopra">
<text>Vidhu Vinod Chopra (born 5 September 1952) is an Indian film director, producer, screenwriter and editor. He is the recipient of several accolades, including four National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards. He is known for directing films such as the crime drama &quot;Parinda&quot; (1989), the patriotic romantic drama &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; (1994), the action drama &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; (2000) and the biographical drama &quot;12th Fail&quot; (2023). He is also known for producing the &quot;Munna Bhai film series&quot;, &quot;3 Idiots&quot; (2009), &quot;PK&quot; (2014), and &quot;Sanju&quot; (2018) under his banner Vinod Chopra Films.

== Early life ==
Chopra was born and grew up in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India to a Punjabi Hindu family. His father was D. N. Chopra and veteran filmmaker Ramanand Sagar was his half-brother. His brother, Vir K. Chopra, was a scholar of Indian politics and worked as a producer. His parents were originally from Peshawar, British India. His mother was Shanti Devi Mahalakshmi, who left Kashmir, due to the Kashmir conflict in 1990. He dedicated his film &quot;Shikara&quot; to his mother, which was based on the same. He studied film direction at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.

== Career ==
Chopra&#x27;s first student short film, &quot;Murder at Monkey Hill&quot; (1976), won the National Film Award for Best Short Experimental Film and the Guru Dutt Memorial Award for Best Student Film.

This was followed by a short documentary highlighting the plight of India&#x27;s destitute children, called &quot;An Encounter with Faces&quot; (1976), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Film in 1979. It also won the Grand Prix at the Tampere Film Festival in 1980.

&quot;Sazaye Maut&quot;, his first full-length feature film, was an adaptation of his previous short, &quot;Murder at Monkey Hill&quot;. It starred Naseeruddin Shah, Radha Saluja and Dilip Dhawan. Vanraj Bhatia composed the music for the film. 

He founded his own production company, Vinod Chopra Films, in 1985. Since then, the company has gone on to produce major Bollywood films, and is currently one of the biggest and most successful film production houses in India.

For , his next directorial venture, Chopra assembled a cast featuring some of the finest acting talent in India. Shabana Azmi, Amol Palekar, Naseeruddin Shah and Pankaj Kapoor, among others, appeared in prominent roles. An inventive meta thriller set in Kashmir, remains one of the notable Indian films in the genre.

His next directorial, the crime drama (1989), proved to be a landmark film in Hindi cinema. It expanded the orbit of the crime drama and the vocabulary of images used in Hindi films while garnering widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards. Several modern Indian filmmakers have expressed their admiration for and drawn inspiration from Chopra&#x27;s film.

Chopra&#x27;s next film, &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; (1994), was a patriotic romantic drama set during the decline of the British Raj. With Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala in lead roles, it was also the last film to have its music composed by the legendary R. D. Burman. Burman received a Filmfare Award for Best Music Director and the film won a total of nine awards at the 40th Filmfare Awards. His following two films, &quot;Kareeb&quot; and &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot;, were also critically and commercially successful.

Chopra then produced 5 films with filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani for 5 films: &quot;Munna Bhai MBBS&quot;, &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot;, &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, &quot;PK&quot;, and &quot;Sanju&quot;. The first 3, which Chopra also co wrote, each won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, and &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot; also won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay. They were all also very commercially successful, with &quot;3 Idiots&quot; and &quot;PK&quot; becoming the highest grossing Indian films of all time in India and worldwide, also breaking into East Asian markets. He also wrote and produced &quot;Parineeta&quot;, &quot;Ferrari Ki Sawaari&quot;, and &quot;Wazir&quot;.

However, Chopra&#x27;s next directorials after 2000 were not as successful. His 2007 film &quot;&quot; was a financial disappointment. He also made his Hollywood directorial debut in 2015 with the film &quot;Broken Horses&quot;, a remake of his own film Parinda. However, it received a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 22%, and was a commercial disaster, only making Rs. 60 lakh in its opening weekend. His 2020 release &quot;Shikara&quot; was a romantic drama about the Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus. It became his lowest grossing film since Khamosh.

Chopra then saw a return to success with his 2023 release, the biopic &quot;12th Fail&quot;. Despite a low opening day box office, due to great reviews and word of mouth, it became a financial hit, grossing 70 crores on a 20 crore budget. It then won 5 Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Director, Screenplay, and Editing for Chopra.

<text>Yash Raj Chopra (27 September 1932 21 October 2012) was an Indian film director and film producer who worked in Hindi cinema. The founding chairman of the film production and distribution company Yash Raj Films, Chopra was the recipient of several awards, including 6 National Film Awards and 8 Filmfare Awards. He is considered among the best Hindi filmmakers, particularly known and admired for his romantic films with strong female leads. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honoured him with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2001, and the Padma Bhushan in 2005. In 2006, British Academy of Film and Television Arts presented him with a lifetime membership, making him the first Indian to receive the honour.

Chopra began his career as an assistant director to I. S. Johar and his elder brother, B.R. Chopra. He made his directorial debut with &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot; in 1959, a melodrama about illegitimacy, and followed it with the social drama &quot;Dharmputra&quot; (1961). Chopra rose to prominence after directing the critically and commercially successful family drama &quot;Waqt&quot; (1965), which pioneered the concept of ensemble casts in Bollywood. In 1970, he founded his own production company, Yash Raj Films, whose first production was &quot;Daag: A Poem of Love&quot; (1973), a successful melodrama about polygamy. His success continued in the seventies, with some of Indian cinema&#x27;s most successful and iconic films, including the action-thriller &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), which established Amitabh Bachchan as a leading actor in Bollywood; the ensemble musical romantic drama &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; (1976) and the ensemble family drama &quot;Trishul&quot; (1978).

Chopra collaborated with Sridevi in two of what has been considered to be his finest films; the romantic musical &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989), which became instrumental in ending the era of violent films in Bollywood and rejuvenating the romantic musical genre, and the intergenerational musical romantic drama &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991), considered by critics and Chopra himself to be his best work, but underperformed at the domestic box-office, although bringing major profits overseas. After helming the critically-panned &quot;Parampara&quot; (1993), Chopra directed the musical psychological thriller &quot;Darr&quot; (1993), the first of his collaborations with Shahrukh Khan. Chopra directed three more romantic films, all starring Khan; &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004) and &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; (2012), before announcing his retirement from direction in 2012. He died of dengue fever during &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot;″s production in 2012. He is considered one of the all-time best directors in Bollywood industry.

== Early life ==

Chopra was born on 27 September 1932 in Lahore, Punjab Province, British India into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. His father was an accountant in the PWD division of the British Punjab administration. He was the youngest of eight children, the oldest of whom was almost 30 years his senior. The eminent film-maker B. R. Chopra is one of his brothers, and Yash Johar is his sister&#x27;s husband, thus making him the uncle of Karan Johar and Ravi Chopra.

Chopra was largely brought up in the Lahore house of his second brother, B. R. Chopra, then a film journalist. Chopra studied at Doaba College Jalandhar and originally sought to pursue a career in engineering. He later moved to Ludhiana, East Punjab (in India) after the Partition of India.

Like many other Punjabi Hindu families, who were associated with the Arya Samaj movement, in his youth Chopra was a member of the &quot;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&quot;, later in his life he would recall that he didn&#x27;t see it as a Hindu nationalist organization but as a club of boy-scouts with emphasis on physical training as well mental health, through kabbadi and yoga.

His passion for film-making led him to travel to Bombay, where he initially worked as an assistant director to I. S. Johar, and then for his director-producer brother, B. R. Chopra, while another brother, Dharam Chopra, worked as his cameraman.

== Career==
=== Early career (1959–1970) ===
Chopra received his first directorial opportunity in 1959 with the social drama &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot;, produced by his elder brother B.R. Chopra and starring Mala Sinha, Rajendra Kumar and Nanda. The film revolved around a Muslim bringing up an &quot;illegitimate&quot; Hindu child. The film was well received by critics and became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year. Encouraged by their success, the Chopras made another hard-hitting social drama, &quot;Dharmputra&quot; (1961). It was one of the first films to depict the Partition of India and Hindu fundamentalism. The film marked the debut of Shashi Kapoor in a fully fledged role and was awarded with the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.

Chopra&#x27;s collaboration with his brother continued in the form of the 1965 film &quot;Waqt&quot;, which featured an ensemble cast including Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Sadhana, Balraj Sahni, Madan Puri, Sharmila Tagore, Achala Sachdev and Rehman. The film became a critical and commercial success. It is acknowledged as a &quot;found film&quot; of the &quot;lost-and-found&quot; genre. Setting many other trends, it was one of Indian cinema&#x27;s first multi-starrers, a mode which became increasingly popular among the producers during the 1970s. It also began the now-obligatory style of depicting wealth and social class. Chopra received his first Filmfare Award for Best Director for the film.

In 1969, Chopra directed two films produced by his brother. The first was &quot;Aadmi Aur Insaan&quot;, which featured Dharmendra and Saira Banu in the lead roles. He directed &quot;Ittefaq&quot; (1969), a mystery thriller film based on a Gujarati play, depicting the events of a single night, with Rajesh Khanna and Nanda in the lead roles. Shot in a month and on a low budget, the film was deemed unusual by critics. Despite a being a slow starter, it eventually became a hit and won Chopra his second Filmfare Award for Best Director.

=== Formation of Yash Raj Films, continued success, setback and resurgence (1971–1992) ===

 His first independently-produced film, &quot;Daag: A Poem of Love&quot; (1973), a melodrama about polygamy, starring Rajesh Khanna, Sharmila Tagore and Raakhee was a blockbuster and won Chopra his third Filmfare Award for Best Director.

He directed a number of cult classics starring Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan, and scripted by Salim–Javed, notably &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) and &quot;Trishul&quot; (1978), which were major critical and commercial successes and remain popular even today. These films set the trend for the late-&#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, establishing Bachchan as the &quot;angry young man&quot;. Chopra produced, directed and scripted two more films starring the duo. Unlike his earlier action-oriented films, these were musical romantic dramas: (1976), co-starring Waheeda Rehman, Raakhee, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, followed by &quot;Silsila&quot; (1981), co-starring Jaya Bachchan, Rekha and Sanjeev Kumar. Chopra suggested Javed Akhtar to become a lyricist, starting from this film. He also directed the duo in the action drama &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; (1979), based on the Chasnala mining disaster. The film emerged a box office hit and received several Filmfare Award nominations.

The 1980s marked a professional setback in Chopra&#x27;s career, as several films he directed and produced in that period failed to leave a mark at the Indian box-office. His film &quot;Mashaal&quot; (1984) was his first collaboration with the legendary actor, Dilip Kumar. The action-oriented film, which was based on the well-known Marathi play titled &quot;Ashroonchi Zhali Phule&quot;, received critical acclaim, but fared only average at the box-office. A year later, he made &quot;Faasle&quot;, a romantic drama starring Sunil Dutt, Rekha, Rohan Kapoor and Farah, which proved to be a critical and commercial disaster at the box-office. He and critics consider it his worst film. &quot;Vijay&quot; (1988) was also a box-office failure. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and was dubbed a remake of &quot;Trishul&quot;.

Chopra&#x27;s lean phase ended in 1989 with the highly-successful romantic musical &quot;Chandni&quot;, a film with all the hallmarks of what has come to be known as the &quot;Yash Chopra style&quot;: heroine-oriented, romantic, emotional, depicting the lifestyle of the elite, with melodious music used in songs picturized in foreign locations. It marked the first collaboration between Chopra and Sridevi. The huge success of its soundtrack was instrumental in ending the era of violence in Bollywood films and bringing back music into Hindi films. After a string of critically and commercially films, the success of &quot;Chandni&quot; consolidated Sridevi&#x27;s position as the top female Bollywood star of the era. Though it was not the first time Chopra shot a film in Switzerland, the extensive scenes shot there made it a popular tourist destination for Indians. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment for 1989, in addition to earning Chopra his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.&quot;&quot;

He followed it with &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991) an intergenerational musical romantic drama starring frequent collaborators Sridevi and Anil Kapoor. The film received widespread critical acclaim, had exceptional music, and was one of the biggest Bollywood hits in the overseas market; however, it was a flop in India due to its controversial storyline. The film won five Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film, and earned Chopra his ninth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. Over the years, &quot;Lamhe&quot; has been hailed as a cult classic; it is regarded as a modern masterpiece and possibly his finest film to date. It was featured in &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of All-Time Great Indian films. It has been cited by Chopra as his personal favourite of his films.

In 1992, Chopra directed &quot;Parampara&quot;. Despite an all-star cast of Ramya Krishnan, Aamir Khan, Raveena Tandon, Sunil Dutt, Anupam Kher, Vinod Khanna, Ashwini Bhave and Saif Ali Khan (in his film debut), the film was a commercial failure and was panned by critics for its weak storyline and soundtrack, although Chopra&#x27;s direction was commended.

=== Later career (1993–2012) ===

In 1993, Chopra directed the newcomer Shahrukh Khan along with Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol in the musical psychological thriller &quot;Darr&quot;. The film depicted the story of an obsessed lover (Khan) and the lengths to which he goes to pursue a woman (Chawla) who is already happily engaged to another man (Deol). The film was a runaway success and is now considered a cult classic. &quot;Darr&quot; emerged as one of the highest-grossing Hindi films of 1993. It also established Khan as a bankable star and earned Chopra the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, in addition to his tenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

In 1995, Chopra launched the television production house &quot;Metavision&quot;. This company produced a singing reality show &quot;Meri Awaaz Suno&quot; (1995–1997), a talk show &quot;Meri Pasand&quot; (1995–1996), and a telefilm &quot;Humko Ishq Ne Mara&quot; (1997).

In 1997, Chopra directed, produced and co-wrote the musical romantic drama &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot;, starring yet again Shahrukh Khan in a love quadrangle with Madhuri Dixit, Karisma Kapoor and Akshay Kumar. It was the first Bollywood film to be shot in Germany. The film became the highest grosser for the year and won several awards, including 8 Filmfare Awards (including an eleventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director for Chopra) and 3 National Film Awards, including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Chopra then took a sabbatical from directing and focused solely on producing films for over 7 years.

In 2004, he returned to direction with the epic love saga &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;. Starring Shahrukh Khan again, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukerji in lead roles, the film was the biggest hit of 2004 in both domestic and overseas markets, with a worldwide gross of over 940 million and was screened at the Berlin Film Festival to high critical appreciation. The film which narrated the star-crossed love story of an Indian air-force officer Veer Pratap Singh (Khan) and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Hayaat Khan (Zinta) was highly appreciated by critics. Rama Sharma from &quot;The Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;Giving love its due, Chopra has understandably linked the script to the life of a common man. The pace is exacting. Drawing from the best of the two countries, the story is made more colorful by a spray of the Punjabi culture—be it celebrating Lohri in India or visiting a dargah in Pakistan. He has handled the script cleverly. Whenever the pace begins to slacken, he introduces a new character and a twist.&quot; &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; won 4 Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film, and earned Chopra a record-setting twelfth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. The film also won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.

In September 2012, in a special interview with actor Shahrukh Khan on the occasion of his 80th birthday, Chopra announced that &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; (2012) would be his last directorial venture and that he would opt to focus on his production company and his personal life. For the shoot of the last remaining song in &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan,&quot; director Yash Chopra wanted to shoot a scene with a sari-clad Katrina Kaif romancing Shahrukh Khan in the lush meadows of the Swiss Alps. But his illness, caused by a bout of dengue, stymied the plan for the song, which would have reflected his trademark directorial style.

=== Frequent collaborations ===

Chopra was known to often cast the same actors in his films, his most famous collaborations being with Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjeev Kumar, Madan Puri, Amrish Puri, Prem Chopra, Nirupa Roy, Aruna Irani, Bindu, Manmohan Krishna, Poonam Dhillon, Parikshit Sahni, Shashi Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, Neetu Singh, Raakhee, Rajesh Khanna, Sunil Dutt, Anil Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Hema Malini, Anupam Kher, Iftekhar, Achala Sachdev, Vikas Anand and more recently, Shahrukh Khan.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
In 1970, Chopra married Pamela Singh and together they have two sons Aditya Chopra and Uday Chopra, born in 1971 and 1973, respectively. Aditya Chopra is also a film director and producer and holds the position of chairman and managing director of Yash Raj Films, while Uday is an assistant director turned actor who made his acting debut in 2000 in his brother&#x27;s directorial, &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;. Uday is currently the Director – Yash Raj Films, CEO – YRF Entertainment.

=== Religion ===
Chopra was born into an Arya Samaji family, a Hindu reformist movement noted for pushing social reforms, and in her book on Chopra Rachel Dwyer would say it had an influence at many levels: at a personal level, Chopra would refuse to identify as a Khatri, as it&#x27;d appear casteist; when it comes to his filmmaking style, the Chopra film clan in general would make movies containing a message of social change. 

== Death ==

On 13 October 2012, Chopra was diagnosed with dengue fever and was admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra, Mumbai. On 21 October, Yash Chopra succumbed to death following multiple organ failure. He was 80 years of age. The Chautha ceremony for Yash Chopra was held on 25 October 2012 at Yash Raj Films studio. Yash Chopra&#x27;s final rites took place at Pawan Hans crematorium on 22 October 2012.

<text>Cath Maige Tuired (modern spelling: Cath Maighe Tuireadh; ) is the name of two saga texts of the Mythological Cycle of Irish mythology. It refers to two separate battles in Connacht: the first in the territory of Conmhaícne Cúile Tuireadh near Cong, County Mayo, the second near Lough Arrow in County Sligo. The two texts tell of battles fought by the Tuatha Dé Danann, the first against the Fir Bolg, and the second against the Fomorians.

Maigh Tuireadh is typically anglicised as Moytura or Moytirra.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cath&quot; is an Old Irish word meaning &quot;battle, combat&quot;. &quot;Mag&quot; is an earlier spelling of &quot;maigh&quot;, meaning &quot;plain&quot;. Ellis suggests that &quot;tuired&quot; (&quot;tuireadh&quot; in modern spelling) means &quot;pillars&quot; or &quot;towers&quot;, but the Royal Irish Academy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Irish Language&quot; translates &quot;tuiredh&quot; as &quot;a lament&quot;. 

==The First Battle of Mag Tuired==
The first text, sometimes called &quot;Cét-chath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;The First Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;) or &quot;Cath Maighe Tuireadh Cunga&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Mag Tuired Conga&quot;) or &quot;Cath Maighe Tuireadh Theas&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Southern Mag Tuired&quot;), relates how the Tuatha Dé Danann took Ireland from the Fir Bolg, who then inhabited the island. It begins with the children of Nemed, an earlier group of inhabitants of Ireland, leaving for Greece to escape their oppression by the Fomorians. A group of Nemed&#x27;s descendants, the Fir Bolg, return to Ireland and conquer it, occupying it for thirty years until the coming of the Tuatha Dé Danann, another group of Nemed&#x27;s descendants.

The Tuatha Dé Danann, led by their king, Nuada, come to Ireland in three hundred ships from the islands of the north. Their arrival is foreseen in a dream by the Fir Bolg king, Eochaid mac Eirc. When they land, they burn their ships. Negotiations begin between Sreng, the champion of the Fir Bolg, and Bres of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and Bres demands that the Fir Bolg either give battle or cede half of Ireland to them. The Fir Bolg choose battle. After a delay to prepare weapons, they met at the Pass of Balgatan, and the battle rages for four days. Nuada encounters Sreng, and with one swing of his sword Sreng cuts off Nuada&#x27;s right hand. However, the Tuatha Dé Danann gain the ascendancy. A truce is called, and the Fir Bolg are given three options: leave Ireland, share the land with the Tuatha Dé Danann, or continue the battle. They choose to fight. Sreng challenges Nuada to single combat. Nuada accepts on the condition that Sreng ties up one arm to make the combat fair, but Sreng rejects this condition. The Tuatha Dé Danann then decide to offer the Fir Bolg one of the provinces of Ireland. Sreng chooses Cóiced Ol nEchmacht, and the two sides make peace.

Dian Cecht, the god of physicians, made an artificial hand of silver for Nuada, and Nuada was named Nuada Airgetlám (&quot;Nuada of the Silver Hand&quot;). However, the goddess Brigid had told the Tuatha Dé Danann that no-one with a blemish can rule them, and, having lost a hand, the Tuatha Dé Danann had to choose another king. They chose Bres, son of Elatha, king of the Fomorians or the Children of Domnu. Seven years later Bres dies after taking a drink while hunting, and Nuada, having had his arm replaced, is restored.

The First Battle is distinguished from the Second as the Battle of Muigh Tuiredh Conga or the Battle of Southern Moytura.

==The Second Battle of Mag Tuired==
The second text of this name, also known as &quot;Cath Dédenach Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;The Last Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;), &quot;Cath Tánaiste Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;The Second Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;), and &quot;Cath Maighe Tuireadh Thúaidh&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Northern Mag Tuired&quot;), tells how the Tuatha Dé Danann, having conquered Ireland, fall under the oppression of the Fomorians, and then fight a battle to free themselves from this oppression. It expands on references to the battle in &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; and the Irish Annals, and is one of the richest sources of tales of the former Irish gods. It is found in a 16th-century manuscript, but is believed to be a composite work compiled in the 12th century from 9th century material.

It begins with a brief account of the first battle, the loss of Nuada&#x27;s arm, and his replacement as king by Bres, and then tells how Bres was conceived from a union between Ériu of the Tuatha Dé Danann and Elatha of the Fomorians. Because of his ancestry Bres oppressed the Tuatha Dé Danann, making the noblest of them do menial work, imposing heavy tribute, and failing to show the level of hospitality expected of a king. He is deposed as king, and Nuada, who has had his arm replaced with one of silver by the physician Dian Cecht (whose son Miach caused flesh to grow over it), is restored. Bres appeals for assistance from the Fomorians to take back the kingship, and although his father Elatha refuses, another Fomorian leader, Balor of the Evil Eye, agrees to help him and raises a huge army. Meanwhile, Lugh, another product of a Tuatha Dé Danann and Fomorian union, arrives at Nuada&#x27;s court, and, after impressing the king with his many talents, is given command of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Nuada is killed by Balor in the battle, but Lugh, Balor&#x27;s grandson, kills the Fomorian leader with his sling, smashing his deadly eye through the back of his head where it wreaks havoc on the Fomorian ranks. Bres is found alive in the aftermath of the battle, and is spared on the condition that he teach the Tuatha Dé Danann how to plough, sow and reap. Finally, Lugh, the Dagda and Ogma rescue the Dagda&#x27;s harp, Uaithne, which had been captured by the retreating Fomorians.

==Adaptations==
* Pádraic Colum adapted &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; into the play &quot;Moytura: A Play for Dancers&quot;, first performed during the 1963 Dublin Theatre Festival (24 September–6 October 1963).

<doc id="838751" wikidata="Q3401588" url="?curid=838751" title="Prem Chopra">
<text>Prem Chopra (born 23 September 1935) is an Indian actor in Hindi films. He has acted in 380 films over a span of over 60 years. He has 3 children (Rakita, Prerna, and Punita), and 7 grandchildren (Sanchi, Khyana, Veer, Risha, Vaaryan, &amp; Vihaan).

==Life and education==
Chopra, the third of six children of Ranveerlal and Rooprani Chopra, a Punjabi Hindu family, was born on 23 September 1935, in Lahore. After the partition of India, his family moved to Shimla, where he was brought up. He has studied in S.D. Senior Secondary School, Shimla. His father desired for him to be a doctor or an Indian Administrative Services Officer.

Chopra completed his schooling and college in Shimla after his father, who was a government servant, got transferred there. He graduated from Panjab University. He took part in college dramatics enthusiastically. At his father&#x27;s insistence, he completed his graduation and then went to Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Soon after he made his debut film, his mother was diagnosed with mouth cancer and she died, leaving his then nine-year-old sister Anju to be looked after by his father and his four other brothers. The brothers had given a warning to their respective wives that only if their sister is happy, would they be happy and Prem considers his sister to be his first daughter. Noted writer-director Lekh Tandon brought the proposal of Uma for marriage to Prem. Uma was the younger sister of the siblings Krishna Kapoor (wife of Raj Kapoor), Prem Nath and Rajendranath. The couple have three daughters, Rakita, Punita and Prerna Chopra. Rakita is married to film publicity designer Rahul Nanda, the son of author and screenwriter Gulshan Nanda. Punita owns a preschool called Wind Chimes in Bandra, suburban Mumbai, and is married to singer and television actor Vikas Bhalla. Prerna is married to Bollywood actor Sharman Joshi. Chopra resides in a duplex apartment in Pali Hill, Bandra in Mumbai.

He became estranged from two of his four brothers in the late 1980s. Chopra had bought a bungalow in 1980 in Delhi, which was jointly owned by him and his father, and his father and one brother used to stay there. Chopra had gotten his brother a job in Delhi and made him stay at the bungalow. But his father, a day before his death, was made to sign a will favouring one of his brothers, taking away Chopra&#x27;s rights to the bungalow. Later, an income tax raid happened in that same house, and his brother said in the raid that Chopra had given them the bungalow, but the house still was in name of Prem Chopra. Chopra had two other houses in Mumbai as well, which were sold off cheaply by his other brothers without telling him, as they needed the money.

His biography titled &quot;Prem Naam Hai Mera, Prem Chopra&quot;, written by his daughter Rakita Nanda, was released in April 2014.

==Career==

===Beginnings (1960–1967)===
In Simla, Chopra developed an interest in acting as he had begun to take part in many plays in his college days. Despite stiff opposition from his parents, he managed to go to Bombay to pursue his dream of acting in Bollywood films. In his initial days he stayed at guest houses in Colaba, Mumbai. He started visiting film studios to display his portfolio: The response was not encouraging.

To survive in the fast life of Bombay, he took up a job with &quot;The Times of India&quot; while trying to gain a foothold in the film industry. He looked after circulation of the paper in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar and was required to tour 20 days a month. Chopra used to cut his touring time by calling the agents to come and meet him at the station so that he could quickly return. This way a tour that would normally take 20 days would get completed in 12, and he would spend the rest of the time going from one studio to the other. While travelling by the suburban train one day, a stranger accosted him and asked if he was interested in joining films. Chopra nodded in agreement and went with that stranger to Ranjit Studios where the producers of Chaudhary Karnail Singh were in search of a hero. Jagjit Sethi, a Punjabi producer, gave him a break as the hero of the established star Jabeen Jalil in &quot;Chaudhary Karnail Singh&quot;, a Punjabi film. His debut film was a Hindu-Muslim romantic love story set against the backdrop of Indo-Pak partition and it turned out to be a big hit. The film won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Punjabi. He was paid Rs 2500 for his debut film.

During his stint with the &quot;Times of India&quot;, he worked in Punjabi films including &quot;Sapani&quot; and Hindi films such as &quot;Woh Kaun Thi?&quot;, &quot;Shaheed&quot;, &quot;Main Shaadi Karne Chala&quot; and &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot;. Prem did not consider acting as a full-time profession in the early 1960s, but he kept trying to get roles in films due to his passion for acting. Among his early films, he played Sukhdev in &quot;Shaheed&quot;, one of his rare positive leading roles. Prem had done four movies before &quot;Woh Kaun Thi?&quot;, a box office hit of 1964, had been released. On the sets of &quot;Woh Kaun Thi?&quot; which had Manoj Kumar as lead hero, Prem met Manoj for the first time. Manoj offered Prem a positive role in &quot;Shaheed&quot;, for which Manoj was the presenter. During the shooting of &quot;Main Shadi Karne Chala&quot; someone suggested that he become a villain. He continued working with The Times of India when he was already a part of box office hits like &quot;Nishan&quot;, &quot;Sikandar E Azam&quot; in 1965 and &quot;Sagaai, Mera Saaya&quot; in 1966. After &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; and &quot;Upkaar&quot;, he was flooded with films as a villain.

After &quot;Upkaar&quot; in 1967, he left The Times of India to concentrate solely on acting.

===Established actor (1969–1995)===
Since 1967, he has been a leading villain in Hindi films and his peak period as main villain was from 1967 to 1995. In the 1970s he got plum roles as villains often with Sujit Kumar and Ranjeet. In a few films he played secondary villain to villainous characters of Ajit, Madan Puri, Pran, Prem Nath, Jeevan in the 1970s and 1980s and to Amrish Puri and Amjad Khan in the late 1980s.

In the critically acclaimed comedy film &quot;Hulchul&quot; (1971), a remake of &quot;Anubavam Pudhumai&quot;, he played the lead hero in this suspense thriller. He played the main lead in the 1970 box office hit small-budget comedy film &quot;Samaj Ko Badal Dalo&quot; as a lead hero, and was paired opposite Telugu film actresses Kanchana and Sharada. The song sung by Rafi and picturised on Prem Chopra – &quot;Tum Apni Saheli Ko Itna Bata Do Ki Usse Koi Pyar Karne Laga Hai&quot; from this 1970 film and the song &quot;Rah Mein Kaliya&quot; – a song sung by Kishore Kumar and performed on-screen by Prem Chopra in the film &quot;Nafrat&quot; (1973), a box office flop, continues to be popular. The dialogue &quot;Prem naam hai mera, Prem Chopra&quot; (My name is Prem, Prem Chopra) from the film &quot;Bobby&quot; has been very popular. Another famous Prem Chopra dialogue is from the film &quot;Souten&quot; – &quot;Main wo bala hoon jo sheshay se pathar ko todte hai&quot;, which closely translates to &quot;I am that trouble which crushes stones with glass&quot;. Another dialogue from &quot;Souten&quot; was – &quot;Jinke Ghar Sheeshe Ke Hote Hain Woh Batti Bhujakar Kapde Badalte Hai&quot;. &quot;Main jo aag lagata hoon use boojhana bhi jaanta hoon&quot; from .

He was the regular in villainous roles in the films with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role from 1969 to 1991 from &quot;Doli&quot; (1969) till &quot;Ghar Parivar&quot; (1991). The duo of Prem and Rajesh Khanna acted in 19 films together and 15 of them were box-office hits, and they were very close friends in real life till Khanna&#x27;s death. Prem quoted in an interview &quot;Rajesh Khanna and I were considered a lucky pair and distributors used to tell Rajesh Khanna that we don&#x27;t care who your heroine is, all we want to know is whether Prem Chopra is in the film.&quot; He also mouthed dialogues in the song &quot;Aaj Pila Dey Saathi Apni&quot; sung by Mahendra Kapoor from the film &quot;Doli&quot; (1969). He also mouthed dialogues in the song &quot;Lo Mera Pyar Lelo&quot; from &quot;Nafrat&quot; in 1973 with Asha Bhosle and &quot;Kab Se Ye Dil Hai Pyaasa&quot; from &quot;Mera Muqaddar&quot; in 1988.

He played son to villainous character of actor Ajit in films like &quot;Azaad&quot;, &quot;Chhupa Rustom&quot;, &quot;Jugnu&quot; and co-starred with him in &quot;Des Pardes&quot;, &quot;Ram Balram&quot; and . In the late 80s, he played second fiddle to Amrish Puri only in a few films such as &quot;Awaaz&quot;, &quot;Shahenshah&quot; and . Amrish Puri had played Prem Chopra&#x27;s henchman in &quot;Dostana&quot;, &quot;Immaan Dharam&quot; and a minuscule role in &quot;Naseeb&quot;. Otherwise in the majority of the films from 1969 to 1991 – Prem Chopra was the main villain. In fact, in Rajesh Khanna&#x27;s films from 1969 to 1991, Prem Chopra was always the main villain and was never given a henchman&#x27;s role except in &quot;Awaaz&quot;. He was main villain in all films starring Manoj Kumar from &quot;Upkar&quot; (1967) to &quot;Santosh&quot; (1989).

He was paired opposite actress Bindu regularly in films such as &quot;Lagan&quot; (1971), , &quot;Do Raaste&quot;, &quot;Daag&quot;, &quot;Chhupa Rustam&quot;, &quot;Phandebaaz&quot;, &quot;Tyaag&quot;, &quot;Nafrat&quot;, &quot;Gehri Chaal&quot; and &quot;Daastan&quot;.

Unlike other villains, Chopra&#x27;s on-screen evil didn&#x27;t rely on gizmos, his characters didn&#x27;t rely on henchmen to do the dirty work and he never needed wicked names. Some of his famous dialogues from the 1990s include – &quot;Sharafat aur imaandaari ka certificate ye duniya sirf unhe deti hai jinke paas daulat hoti hai&quot; from &quot;Aag Ka Gola&quot; (1990), &quot;Bhains poonch uthayegi to gaana to nahi gayegi, gobar hi degi&quot; from (1990), &quot;Tu Madhuri se thodi kum aur Mandakini se thodi zyada hai&quot; from (1992), &quot;Rajneeti ki bhains ke liye daulat ki lathi ki zaroorat hoti hai&quot; from &quot;Khiladi&quot; (1992), &quot;Kar bhala to ho bhala&quot; from &quot;Raja Babu&quot; (1994) and &quot;Nanga nahayega kya aur nichodega kya&quot; from &quot;Dulhe Raja&quot; (1998).

===Late career (1996–present)===
After 1996, he appeared as a villain in very few films. He took up positive character roles in 1996 and started getting more positive roles in 2007. His screen space was reduced in the films after 2007.

Prem Chopra considers that his best roles were in &quot;Shaheed&quot; (1965), &quot;Upkaar&quot; (1967), &quot;Purab Aur Pashchim&quot;, &quot;Do Raaste&quot; (1969), &quot;Kati Patang&quot; (1970), &quot;Do Anjaane&quot; (1976), &quot;Jaadu Tona&quot; (1977), &quot;Kala Sona&quot;, &quot;Dostana&quot; (1980), &quot;Kranti&quot; (1981), &quot; Jaanwar&quot;(1982),&quot;Oonche Log&quot; (1985), &quot;Indira&quot; (1989), &quot;Phool Bane Angaarey&quot; (1991), &quot;Bewaffa Se Waffa&quot; and the 19 films with Rajesh Khanna. He considers that his best performances in positive roles came in &quot;Sikander-e-Azam&quot;, &quot;Kunwari&quot;, &quot;Shaheed&quot;, &quot;Jaadu Tona&quot; and &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot;. He disclosed in an interview that &quot;My films with Rajesh Khanna are very special to me. Right from &quot;Doli&quot; then &quot;Do Raaste&quot;, &quot;Kati Patang&quot;, &quot;Daag&quot;, &quot;Ajnabee&quot;, &quot;Prem Nagar&quot;, &quot;Maha Chor&quot;, &quot;Mehbooba&quot;, &quot;Tyaag&quot;, &quot;Bebus&quot;, &quot;Aanchal&quot;, &quot;Jaanwar&quot;, &quot;Souten&quot;, &quot;Maqsad&quot;, &quot;Awaaz&quot;, &quot;Shatru&quot;, &quot;Oonche Log&quot;, &quot;Waapsi&quot; and &quot;Ghar Parivaar&quot;. 15 of 17 released were hits. Each of those films showed different shades of my personality in villainous role.&quot; When asked how he could continue so long in a cinematic career, he said &quot;Although I came to be a hero, my films as a leading man flopped. Which was good in a way because a whole new world opened in front of me. There were so many more roles I could do. When I established myself as a villain it could continue for years.&quot;

<doc id="838768" wikidata="Q4473627" url="?curid=838768" title="Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby">
<text>The Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) was a cancelled plan for a NASA-led exploratory mission designed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, that planned to send a spacecraft to encounter an asteroid, and then to rendezvous with a comet and fly alongside it for nearly three years. The project was eventually canceled when it went over budget; most of the money still left was redirected to its twin spacecraft, &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot;, destined for Saturn, so it could survive Congressional budget cutbacks. Most of CRAF&#x27;s scientific objectives were later accomplished by the smaller NASA spacecraft &quot;Stardust&quot; and Deep Impact, and by ESA&#x27;s flagship &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission.

==Overview==
Designed to be the first of the planned Mariner Mark II series of spacecraft, CRAF was to closely examine a comet during a part of its orbit around the Sun. It was to launch a heavily instrumented penetrator/lander into the comet&#x27;s nucleus to measure temperatures and chemical composition. CRAF&#x27;s other instruments would collect data on the comet&#x27;s nucleus, its coma, and its 
dust and ion cloud and tail. CRAF was also to provide the first close-up look at how a comet&#x27;s coma and its tail of dust and ions form. CRAF and Cassini missions were a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as well as the United States Air Force and the United States Department of Energy.

CRAF was to be launched aboard a Titan IV-Centaur rocket in August 1995, but as of February 1991 the launch date was swapped with Cassini and CRAF&#x27;s launch was moved back to February 1996. The new launch profile included a Venus gravity assist, that added eight months to the planned flight time but offered an increase in payload and better alternatives if the February 1996 launch window were missed. The trajectory would carry CRAF out to the asteroid belt, where a propulsion maneuver would send the spacecraft back toward Earth for a gravity assist boost. CRAF would fly past the Earth in July 1997 to take up its final flight path. By using gravity assist, NASA can launch spacecraft aboard rockets that have less thrust than would be needed for a direct flight.

The spacecraft was to encounter an asteroid named 449 Hamburga in January 1998 en route to the comet. CRAF would take photographs and deploy other scientific measurements during the encounter period. Asteroid 449 Hamburga is about in diameter and is thought to be a carbonaceous type asteroid.

CRAF&#x27;s planned cometary target was Comet Kopff. This was named for August Kopff, who discovered it on August 22, 1906, during an observing session at Koenigstuhl Observatory near Heidelberg, Germany.

Ninety-four years after Kopff&#x27;s discovery, CRAF would arrive at the point with Comet Kopff — in August 2000. Comet and spacecraft would be at the distance of Jupiter&#x27;s orbit, and 850 days before closest approach to the Sun, or perihelion. CRAF would fire its penetrator/lander at the comet in August 2001, then would continue to fly beside Kopff. The spacecraft would take data for a total of two and two-thirds years, until about 109 days after they pass closest to the Sun and are outward bound again. It was to be the first time a spacecraft would have flown in formation with a comet, though a U.S. spacecraft, International Cometary Explorer (ICE), flew by Comet Giacobini-Zinner in 1985, spacecraft from several countries encountered Comet Halley in 1986, and the Giotto spacecraft flew past Comet Grigg-Skjellerup in 1992.

The comet rendezvous would allow study of matter that scientists think is the original, relatively unchanged material left behind when a cloud of dust and gas collapsed to form the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists believe comets now reside in a distant region of the Solar System called the Oort cloud. Current theory holds that gravitational nudges from stars in the Sun&#x27;s neighborhood send some comets from the Oort cloud falling toward the Sun.

The CRAF spacecraft would fly extremely close to the comet&#x27;s nucleus, within . The close-up exploration would take place before the coma and tail begin to build, it would observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. Later the spacecraft would move in and out through the coma and down the tail to study their properties and the complex processes occurring in them, and to collect samples of dust for detailed analysis on board the spacecraft.

In December 2002 the spacecraft and the comet would make their closest approach to the Sun. They would then head outward again toward aphelion near Jupiter&#x27;s orbit. On March 31, 2003, the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby, first primary mission of Mariner Mark II, would end. At that time the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission, with the second Mariner Mark II spacecraft, would be in its Saturnian-tour phase.

==Spacecraft design==
Mariner Mark II class spacecraft developed for NASA by JPL were a new design approach advocated by NASA&#x27;s Solar System Exploration Committee and were intended for flights in the 1990s to the outer planets and primitive bodies, such as comets and asteroids.

CRAF was to be the first Mariner Mark II mission. The second mission, called Saturn Orbiter Titan Probe or SOTP (later &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot;), was a Saturn orbiter with a probe designed to plunge into the atmosphere of the ringed planet&#x27;s largest satellite, Titan. CRAF and SOTP were to use identical Mariner Mark II spacecraft, but each was to carry unique science instruments.

===Instrumentation===
All of the phenomena associated with comets were to be examined by CRAF&#x27;s instruments. And because of the long duration of the planned rendezvous — almost three years — it was expected to fill in many of the major gaps in scientific understanding of the strange objects.

The mission&#x27;s scientific payload was selected in October 1986. It was to include:

*Cameras to photograph the nucleus, coma and tail, and changes that occur as Kopff orbits the Sun. Photos also would help scientists determine the comet&#x27;s size and structure, the location of its poles, its rotation rate and geological structure.
*A surface penetrator-lander to be fired into Kopff&#x27;s nucleus. The instruments aboard the penetrator-lander would collect a sample of cometary ices, study how they change when heated, and perform a chemical analysis of the gases released from the ice. The penetrator would bury its tip, which will contain a gamma-ray spectrometer measuring abundances of as many as 20 chemical elements, up to one meter (three feet) below the comet&#x27;s surface. The penetrator was to carry accelerometers to determine Kopff&#x27;s surface strength and its resistance to puncture, and thermometers to measure temperatures beneath the surface. The penetrator/lander would radio its findings to the spacecraft, which will then relay them to Earth.
* Mass spectrometers to study composition of gases released by the nucleus and the cloud of plasma (ionized gas) surrounding the nucleus.
* Dust counters, collectors and analyzers to capture samples of the comet&#x27;s dust and study them on board. The information would help scientists determine the chemical elements that make up the dust and ice. In addition, the mass, size, shape and composition of individual dust grains will be measured.
* A visual and infrared mapping spectrometer to study chemical composition of the coma and the surface of the nucleus as they change with time.
* A magnetometer and a plasma-wave analyzer to measure interactions between the coma and electrically charged particles streaming from the Sun. The magnetometer was also to measure the comet&#x27;s intrinsic magnetic field, if it has one.

<doc id="838771" wikidata="Q3043193" url="?curid=838771" title="Kamatari Fujiwara">
<text>was a Japanese stage and film actor who appeared in over 200 films between 1933 and 1984. In addition to regular appearances in the films of Akira Kurosawa, he worked for directors such as Mikio Naruse, Yasujirō Ozu, Heinosuke Gosho and others.

==Early life and career==
Fujiwara was born on 15 January 1905 in Tokyo, Japan. Fujiwara had initially focused on music before he became known as a comic actor After performing in Asakusa operas, a popular form of opera during the Taishō era until its decline after the Great Kantō earthquake, he joined Ken&#x27;ichi Enomoto&#x27;s New Casino Folies. Enomoto&#x27;s troupe performed satirical stage shows in an era often associated with the term or &quot;Erotic Grotesque Nonsense&quot; era.

Fujiwara gave his film debut in the 1933 film &quot;Ongaku kigeki – Horoyui jinsei&quot; (lit. &quot;Musical comedy – Intoxicated life&quot;), the first production of the P.C.L. studios (later Toho). Most of Fujiwara&#x27;s later films were Toho productions. He married actress Sadako Sawamura in 1936 (divorced in 1946). In the late 1930s, Fujiwara found himself in trouble with the nationalist government. The authorities were pushing for artists and high profile individuals to change their names to the traditional spelling, and he was under official censure to do so. Despite this, he kept his name.

==Post-war career==
Fujiwara&#x27;s shomin persona always was that of a real-life person. Generally he played the role of an ordinary subject-citizen: petty, conservative, mediocre, far from being handsome or rich. Over time he made this his specialty.

He made his first appearance in an Akira Kurosawa film in the 1952 &quot;Ikiru&quot;, playing the role of Senkichi, and became a long-time member of Kurosawa&#x27;s company of actors until his death. Other films with Kurosawa include &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; and &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. In addition to Kurosawa, Fujiwara regularly appeared in the films of Mikio Naruse, with whom he had worked since the mid-1930s in films like &quot;Wife! Be Like a Rose!&quot;, and had roles in Heinosuke Gosho&#x27;s &quot;An Inn at Osaka&quot; and Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Twilight&quot;. He also started appearing on TV in the 1950s, including the series &quot;Ayu no uta&quot;. 

In 1981, Fujiwara received the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 4th Class. His final film role was in Juzo Itami&#x27;s &quot;The Funeral&quot;. He died in 1985 at the age of 80.

==Legacy==
The peasant duo in Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, played by Minoru Chiaki and Fujiwara, has repeatedly been cited as inspiration for the robot characters C-3PO and R2-D2 in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

<text>Litoměřice (; ) is a town in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

The town is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Litoměřice.

==Administrative division==
Litoměřice consists of four municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Litoměřice-Město (1,503)
*Pokratice (4,436)
*Předměstí (17,483)
*Za nemocnicí (10)
==Geography==

Litoměřice is located about south of Ústí nad Labem and northwest of Prague. The northwestern half of the municipal territory lies in the Central Bohemian Uplands, the southeastern half lies in the Lower Ohře Table, on the edge of the Polabí lowlands. The highest point, located in the northern tip of the territory, is at above sea level. The town is situated on the right (northern) bank of the Elbe River, at its confluence with the Ohře, which flows from the south.

==History==
===Early history===
The settlement of Litoměřice has a deep history of Paleolithic cultures as well as large Celtic settlements of the La Tène culture, which did not survive the incoming Germanic attacks. The area was later settled by Germanic tribes, when Litoměřice first appeared on Ptolemy&#x27;s world map in the 2nd century under the name of Nomisterium. The Germanic tribes later migrated west and those remaining mingled with the incoming Slavs. The earliest evidence of the Slavic settlement comes from the 8th century.

In the 9th and 10th century, Litoměřice fell under the control of the Přemyslid dynasty. Přemyslids built here an early medieval fortress, one of the most important Přemyslid centres in Czech lands. The area was settled by the Czech tribe of Litoměřici, after which the town was named. In 1057, the Litomeřice Chapter was founded by Duke Spytihněv II, and it is the oldest written evidence of the existence of the town.

A royal-town status was granted in 1219 by King Ottokar I. At the beginning of the 13th century, Litoměřice was an important political, cultural and economic centre.

===15th–19th centuries===
The population suffered during the 15th century Hussite Wars. After the Protestant tensions with the Catholics that triggered the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Protestants&#x27; defeat in the Battle of White Mountain, the surviving population of the town was forced to accept Catholicism or face property confiscation and the obligation to leave the kingdom. In this way, the town became a Catholic bishop&#x27;s residency in 1655. As a result, the Czech Protestant population shrank and the town became largely germanized.

In the 18th century, many Baroque building, which are today cultural monuments, were built. However the prosperity of the town suffered from the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years&#x27; War.

===20th century===

In 1918, Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia became constituent parts of the newly created Czechoslovakia), along with a large border area inhabited predominantly by Sudeten Germans. Local Germans tried to join German Austria (which in turn aimed to join post-war Weimar Republic), but Czechoslovak troops prevented this. Known under the informal name of the Sudetenland, the region became the subject of political controversy in the following years. Czechs settled there again, but remained a minority. In 1938, after the Munich Agreement, German troops occupied the Sudetenland (and all the rest of Czech lands a few months later). The Czech population, which had grown to about 5,000 people, had to leave again.

Jews from Litoměřice were forced to flee to the Protectorate or were deported during the Holocaust in the Sudetenland. From March 1944 to May 1945, Leitmeritz concentration camp was located west of the town. 18,000 prisoners passed through the camp and were forced to work mostly on excavating underground factories (Richard I and II) under Radobýl. 4,500 died.

In the final stages of World War II, German troops retreated to escape the advancing Red Army. The Czech resistance took control of the castle on 27 April 1945, and after a few days they started negotiations with the German commander about the terms of his surrender. The Wehrmacht capitulated in the night after 8 May, but German troops fled on 9 May, just before Soviet troops entered the town on 10 May 1945. Most of the German population of the town was expelled by the Beneš decrees in August 1945, along with about 2.5 million other former Czechoslovak citizens of German ethnicity from the country.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
There are no large industrial enterprises located in Litoměřice. The largest employer is the hospital.

Litoměřice is known for viticulture and wine-making. It is the centre of the Litoměřická wine sub-region. The existence of vineyards is already documented in the first written mention of Litoměřice from 1057.

==Transport==
The I/15 road from Most to Česká Lípa passes through the town.

Litoměřice is served by three train stations. The station Litoměřice město is located on the Ústí nad Labem–Kolín line. The stations Litoměřice horní nádraží and Litoměřice Cihelna are located on the lines Most–Litoměřice and Česká Lípa–Postoloprty.

==Religion==
The town is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Litoměřice (part of Archdiocese of Prague), the 4th oldest (and 3rd still existing) Catholic diocese on present Czech territory.

==Culture==

North Bohemian Gallery of Fine Arts is based close the main square. Extensive collection spans from 13th century to contemporary art with numerous other exhibitions during the year. On the Mírové Square is also the Gallery and Museum of Litoměřice diocese.

==Sights==
Since 1978, the historic centre of Litoměřice has been an urban monument reservation. The protected territory is delimited by remains of town walls. About of town walls is preserved to this day. Originally they had four town gates, none of them is preserved. Part of the town fortifications was Litoměřice Castle. Today it contains an exposition of Czech viticulture.

Its core form Mírové Square, a large square with an area of about 2 hectares. Most of the houses on the square are in the Gothic style. The Old Town Hall building on the square is the oldest Renaissance building in the town. Today, the building serves as a regional museum. Other sights on the square include the &quot;Chalice house&quot; (new town hall with a lookout tower in the shape of chalice), &quot;Dům u černého orla&quot; (&quot;Black Eagle House&quot;; one of the most significant Renaissance houses), and Museum of Crystal Touch.

There are several valuable sacral buildings in Litoměřice. On the main square, there is the All Saints Church. Its existence was firstly mentioned in 1235. Originally it belonged to the town fortification. It has a high bell tower. The Baroque Saint Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral at the Dómské Square was built in place of an older Romanesque basilica in the years 1664–1668. It has a high tower open to the public. The interior is almost completely authentic with main and six side altars and a lot of original paintings. Right next to the dome is a bishop&#x27;s residence built in 1683–1701 by Giulio Broggio.

There is also the Jesuit Church of the Annunciation. It is a massive Baroque church built by Giulio and Octavio Broggio in 1701–1731.

<text>Rocky Michael Chopra (born 23 December 1983) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker.

A product of the Newcastle United youth system, he spent six years at the club without managing to secure a regular first team place, instead spending time on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest, and Barnsley. He was sold to Cardiff City for £500,000 in June 2006, and won a place on the PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2006–07 season. He then made a £5 million move to Premier League side Sunderland in July 2007, before returning to Cardiff on a loan deal that was made permanent in July 2009 for £3 million. He again was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009–10 campaign, before being sold on to Ipswich Town for £1 million in June 2011. He joined Blackpool on a free transfer in July 2013, before moving to the Indian Super League with the Kerala Blasters for the inaugural 2014 season. Chopra signed for Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic in March 2015, playing for the side for a year before being released in March 2016. He returned to India to play for the Kerala Blasters again before retiring. As of 2022 Michael has since come back out of retirement to play with West Allotment Celtic.

He has represented England at the under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels. In 2006, he scored what was then the fastest goal by a substitute in Premier League history, scoring after being on the pitch for 15 seconds. A gambling addiction made him fall in severe debt and he had to seek professional help to overcome his addiction.

==Club career==
===Newcastle United===
Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, Chopra attended Gosforth High School in Newcastle, and owing to his goal-scoring exploits there, and later with the Montagu Boys&#x27; Club, was recruited to the Newcastle United academy in July 1993. Being an unused substitute for Newcastle in a Premier League match against Charlton Athletic in October 2002, Chopra signed a three-year contract with the club on 30 October.

Chopra made his professional debut on 6 November, at St James&#x27; Park against Everton in the League Cup. Coming on as a substitute for Lomana LuaLua, he missed a penalty kick in the shootout, sending Everton to the round of 16. He made his UEFA Champions League debut in December 2002 against Barcelona. Coming on as a substitute for Lualua, in the final minutes of the match, Newcastle was handed a 3–1 defeat.

Further playing once for the club against Bayer Leverkusen, Chopra was loaned to second-tier club Watford for five matches on 25 March 2003. During his short loan spell, he scored five goals in as many matches, which included four goals against Burnley. Being behind Alan Shearer, Craig Bellamy, Shola Ameobi and LuaLua in the pecking order, Watford manager Ray Lewington expressed his desire to re-sign him on loan for the next season. He said that Chopra &quot;had an experience he wouldn&#x27;t have believed a month ago having played in an FA Cup semi-final.&quot; On 11 May 2003, Chopra made his Premier League debut as the season ended with a 1–1 draw at West Bromwich Albion, he again replaced LuaLua with eight minutes remaining. In September of the same year, the BBC reported that Indian club Mohun Bagan was interested in signing him.

Failing to find a goal in the 2003–04 season, Newcastle loaned Chopra to Nottingham Forest for a month in February 2004. He failed to find the net, as he ended the season playing eleven times without scoring. At the start of the 2004–05 season, he was loaned for a month to League One club Barnsley in August. Making his debut against Hull City, he would score his first goal for Barnsley against Hartlepool United, opening a 1–1 draw at Victoria Park. Scoring a total of five goals, his loan was extended in November till the end of the season. In the rest of the season, Chopra scored twelve times – including two hat-tricks, one against Peterborough United and another against Huddersfield Town. New Barnsley boss Andy Ritchie intended to sign Chopra in the summer to play alongside Paul Hayes, but was unsuccessful.

Chopra began the 2005–06 season back in Newcastle&#x27;s first team, scoring his first senior goal for Newcastle in the 3–1 away win to Slovak side Dubnica on 17 July in UEFA Intertoto Cup. Making his second start for Newcastle, he opened the scoring in the fourth minute of the match. In the second leg of the match, he suffered concussion, with Sky Sports reporting that he would miss the next game against Spanish club Deportivo de La Coruña. Nevertheless, he played in that match where he &quot;slid home Charles N&#x27;Zogbia&#x27;s cross at the far post&quot;. In a Tyne–Wear derby against Sunderland on 17 April 2006, Chopra scored his only Premier League goal and the fastest by a substitute – finding the net after coming on fifteen seconds earlier. Later in that season Chopra injured his knee ligaments, which he claimed to be the &quot;worst injury&quot; he ever had.

===Cardiff City===
After becoming frustrated at his failure to make an impact at Newcastle, Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for £500,000. On his decision to leave Newcastle, Chopra stated that he had shown loyalty to the club and expressed his desire to receive the same loyalty from the club. He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future. During the season, Chopra scored 22 goals in 44 matches. He helped the club remain top of the Championship throughout September, earning the Championship Player of the month for September. He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season (an annual award given to a set of 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football).

===Sunderland===

In July 2007, newly promoted Premier League side Sunderland agreed a deal worth up to £5 million, activating a release clause, to sign Chopra on a four-year contract. His Geordie roots and high price-tag caused unrest among some Sunderland fans. He scored on his debut for the &quot;Black Cats&quot; on the opening day of the 2007–08 season at the Stadium of Light, coming on as a substitute late in the second half and scored the winning goal against Tottenham Hotspur in injury time. He scored in the next game at Birmingham City, but then went 15 games without scoring before he converted a penalty at Reading on 23 December. He went on to score the only goal of a 1–0 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park, before he scored his sixth and final goal of the season in Sunderland&#x27;s 3–2 win over Tees–Wear derby rivals Middlesbrough, finishing as the second highest scorer at the club, being just one goal behind Kenwyne Jones. After missing the initial matches for &quot;personal problems&quot;, he scored two goals in his second game of the 2008–09 season as Sunderland beat Middlesbrough 2–0 on 20 September.

With the arrivals of Djibril Cissé and El-Hadji Diouf, Chopra found his playing time to be limited. So he rejoined Cardiff City in November on a two-month loan. Chopra made his debut against Queens Park Rangers playing the entire ninety minutes of the 1–0 defeat. In the next match against Crystal Palace, he found his first goal. Chopra converted a 31st-minute penalty the saw Cardiff winning the match 2–1. Scoring five goals in this spell, he was recalled from loan by the new Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia to the squad, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing that he was &quot;excited&quot; to return to the squad. Chopra rejoined Cardiff on loan in February 2009 for the rest of the season, with the transfer becoming permanent at the end of the season. Cardiff chairman Peter Ridsdale said that Chopra was &quot;over the moon&quot; about the transfer. During his second loan spell at the club, he found the net four times.

===Return to Cardiff===
Chopra completed a permanent move on 1 July following the opening of the transfer window for a fee of £3 million. The transfer smashed the club&#x27;s transfer record which was previously held by the £1.75 million signing of Peter Thorne from Stoke City in 2001. He scored on his debut, netting the first and third goals in a 4–0 victory over Scunthorpe United. Chopra then would score in consecutive matches against Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. In the post-match ceremony, manager Dave Jones commented, &quot;Chopra is on fire, he&#x27;s scored seven goals already and he&#x27;s shown he will get the goals if he gets the supply&quot;. Chopra finished the season with a total of 21 goals, including a four-goal haul against Derby County. For a second time, he was included in the PFA Team of the Year.

After the season, &quot;Goal.com&quot; reported that Ipswich Town had lodged a £3 million bid to secure Chopra&#x27;s services. Though it was increased, he continued the next season with Cardiff City. In the 2010–11 season, he suffered a hamstring injury during a match against Barnsley on 23 April 2011 ruling him out of action for 10 to 12 weeks. A statement released by the club confirmed the blow, speculating that they would be required to finish the season without him However, he would return to feature in both the legs of the Championship play-offs against Reading. In the second leg, he was near to scoring, only for his shot to be deflected by Reading captain Matt Mills.

===Ipswich Town===
On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned a three-year deal with Ipswich Town signing for an undisclosed fee, which was reported by &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot; to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed that he was the type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two matches against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.

===Blackpool===
Though he was close to signing with Barnsley, Chopra signed for Blackpool in July 2013. &quot;Wales Online&quot; wrote that he joined the club to regain his &quot;goal touch&quot;. He said that the Blackpool move was a fresh start for him. He also expressed his confidence of scoring goals playing alongside the two wingers – Tom Ince and Matt Phillips. In January of the following year, he was fined for a tweet in which he criticised the club&#x27;s training schedules. During his time with the side, he made 20 appearances but failed to score in any of them.

===Kerala Blasters===
In August 2014, Chopra confirmed his participation in the inaugural season of the Indian Super League. He said that he felt honoured to &quot;involved in this new era&quot;. He was drafted by Kerala Blasters which was managed by David James. In an interview, he said that he felt honoured to &quot;play for a team that is owned by Sachin Tendulkar&quot;. He made his debut in the first match against NorthEast United, coming as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat, with &quot;The Times of India&quot; commenting that he &quot;looked sharp&quot;. His time in India was cut short by an injury, which he suffered in a training for a match against Atlético de Kolkata. &quot;Goal.com&quot; criticized him for his poor &quot;fitness level&quot; and wrote that he never &quot;impressed in the competition and failed to find the back of the net&quot;. Nevertheless, he played the 120 minutes of the semifinal against Chennaiyin, and also started the final against the Kolkatan side where he managed two shots on goal. He ended the season playing nine times without scoring.

Reflecting on his stint in first season of Indian Super League, Chopra admitted that ISL turned out to be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said: &quot;I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I thought it was going to be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.

===Alloa Athletic===
On 17 March 2015, Chopra signed for Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic for the rest of the season. On that very day, he made his debut against Rangers. On 2 May 2015, he scored his first goal for Alloa when he scored from six yards out in a league match against Cowdenbeath. Four days later, he scored his second goal for the club, as he opened the scoring in a 2–0 victory against Brechin City in the relegation play-offs. Chopra was released by Alloa due to injury in March 2016, exactly one year after he signed for the club.

===Return to Kerala Blasters===
On 7 August 2016, Chopra made a return to Kerala Blasters after not being retained by them in the second edition of the Indian Super League.

To show that his injury prone ankle would hold up to the rigours of the league and not affect the club&#x27;s bid to bounce back from a poor finish in the previous season, Chopra had a three-week training stint with Pune outfit DSK Shivajians before joining the Blasters.

On 14 October 2016, he scored his first goal for Kerala Blasters, the only goal in a 1–0 win, playing at home against Mumbai City.

===West Allotment Celtic===
On 27 June 2022, Chopra signed for Northern League Division One side West Allotment Celtic.

==International career==
Chopra has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels. He played in the 2000 UEFA European Under-16 Championship and the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship.

Born and raised in England, Chopra is eligible to play for India through his father. In November 2010, Chopra entered into talks over acquiring an Indian passport in order to represent India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. However, without an Indian passport (though he carries an Overseas Citizenship of India), and the Indian government&#x27;s refusal to change its stance on dual citizenship, Chopra cannot play for India without first renouncing his British citizenship. In August 2014, Chopra stated that he wanted to play for India at international level, and was willing to renounce his British citizenship to do so.

== Coaching career ==
Chopra retired from football in 2016, going on to work as a football agent in Amsterdam. In July 2017, it was reported that Chopra had enrolled on an AIFF D-License coaching course.

==Personal life==
Chopra appeared in &quot;OK!&quot; magazine in October 2007 to announce he had become engaged to Heather Swan, and that they were expecting their first child. On 15 February 2008, their son, Sebastian Rocco Thomas Chopra, weighing 6 lb 10 oz was born. In July, it was reported that the couple had split only weeks after their £250,000 wedding, but they later reconciled as she vowed to &quot;stand by him&quot; as he entered rehab for his gambling addiction, which included a spell at the Sporting Chance clinic. In September 2008 the police were called to Chopra&#x27;s home in response to a domestic abuse call. In 2009, Chopra was publicly dumped by his wife on Facebook. He was re-admitted to the same clinic for three weeks in October 2011. In December 2011, Ipswich Town gave Chopra a £250,000 loan to help pay off his gambling debts.

In December 2011, Chopra and his father were involved in a cocaine drugs trial in Newcastle upon Tyne crown court. On 4 October 2012, Chopra was one of three footballers among a group charged by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) over an investigation into &quot;suspicious betting activity&quot;. The allegations focus on horses being laid to lose on betting exchanges. On 25 January 2013, he was found guilty of this offence and given a 10-year ban from racing by the BHA.

<doc id="838790" wikidata="Q17011691" url="?curid=838790" title="Munsee-Delaware Nation">
<text>Munsee-Delaware Nation (Munsee: Nalahii Lunaapewaak, &quot;meaning: Lenapes from the Upstream&quot;, in contrast with The Lenape at Moraviantown, referred to as &quot;Downstrean Lenapes&quot;) is a Lenape First Nations band government located west of St. Thomas, in southwest Ontario, Canada. 

Known previously as the Munsee of the Thames, their land base is the Munsee-Delaware Nation 1 reserve, with the unincorporated community of Muncey, west from the Oneida Nation of the Thames, as their main community. The reserve is splintered into several non-contiguous areas, made up of individual lots within the Chippewas of the Thames reserve. As of January 2014, their registered population was 612 people, though only 148 lived on their own reserve.

==History==
Members of the Munsee branch of the Lenape nation arrived in the area in the 18th century. John Graves Simcoe, the lieutenant governor, encouraged the Munsee to settle there although Chippewa were already established there. In 1819 the Chippewa of the Thames reserve was established, and in 1840 the Munsee and the Chippewa finally reached an agreement to share the land. In 1967 the Munsee portion became part of the current reserve, which was established by Order in Council.

==Demographics==
The Munsee-Delaware First Nation had a registered population of 524 in April 2004, of whom 163 lived on the reserve. By January 2011, the nation had a total registered population of 555, of whom 145 lived on the reserve.

==Governance==
Munsee-Delaware Nation&#x27;s Chief and Council are elected officials who serve a two (2) year term of office. Elections are governed by their own Band Custom Election Code. Chief and Council are directly accountable to the band membership for the success of the Nation and the conduct of its affairs and for carrying out the community&#x27;s mission and vision.

The history of Munsee-Delaware Nation elected Chief and Council are:

*2014 / 2016 Term - Chief Roger Thomas, Head Councillor Aaron Dolson Jr., Councillor Ryan Peters, Councillor Rose Snake, Councillor Candy Thomas
*2012 / 2014 Term - Chief Patrick Waddilove, Head Councillor Rose Snake, Councillor Frank Cooper, Councillor Dean Snake, Councillor Leander Snake
*Bi-election August 3, 2013 - Chief Roger Thomas
*2010 / 2012 Term - Chief Patrick Waddilove, Head Councillor Rose Snake, Councillor -

<text>The Member of Parliament for [[Ogmore (UK Parliament constituency)|Ogmore]] in Bridgend County Borough, Sir Raymond Powell, of the Labour Party died on 7 December 2001.

The by-election to fill the seat was held on 14 February 2002. It would be the only British parliamentary by-election held in that year. Labour faced no realistic challenge in this very safe seat and retained it easily, with only Plaid Cymru making progress from their 2001 result. The Socialist Labour Party, who had not previously stood, achieved a good result for a minor party and retained their deposit.
