<text>Eliza Maud &quot;Elsie&quot; Inglis (16 August 1864 – 26 November 1917) was a Scottish medical doctor, surgeon, teacher, suffragist, and founder of the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals. She was the first woman to hold the Serbian Order of the White Eagle.

==Early life and education==
Inglis was born on 16 August 1864, in the hill station town of Naini Tal, British India. Inglis had eight siblings and was the second daughter and third youngest. Her parents were Harriet Lowes Thompson and John Forbes David Inglis (1820–1894), a magistrate who worked in the Indian civil service as Chief Commissioner of Oudh through the East India Company, as did her maternal grandfather. Inglis&#x27;s parents considered the education of a daughter as important as that of a son, and also had them schooled in India. Elsie and her sister Eva had 40 dolls which she used to treat for &#x27;spots&#x27; (measles) she had painted on.

Inglis&#x27;s father was religious and used his position in India to &quot;encourage native economic development, spoke out against infanticide and promoted female education.&quot; Inglis&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Rev Henry Simson of Chapel of Garioch in Aberdeenshire. She was a cousin to the gynaecologist Sir Henry Simson, as well as fellow female medical pioneer Grace Cadell.

Inglis&#x27;s father retired (when aged 56) from the East India Company to return to Edinburgh, via Tasmania, where some of her older siblings settled. Inglis went on to a private education in Edinburgh (where she had led a successful demand by the schoolgirls to use private gardens in Charlotte Square) and finishing school in Paris. Inglis&#x27;s decision to study medicine was delayed by nursing her mother, during her last illness (scarlet fever) and her death in 1885, when she felt obliged to stay in Edinburgh with her father.

In 1887, the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women was opened by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake and Inglis started her studies there. In reaction to Jex-Blake&#x27;s methods, and after two fellow students Grace and Georgina Cadell were expelled, Inglis and her father founded the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women, under the auspices of the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women, whose sponsors included Sir William Muir, a friend of her father from India, now Principal of the University of Edinburgh. Inglis&#x27;s sponsors also arranged clinical training for female students under Sir William MacEwen at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

In 1892, she obtained the Triple Qualification, becoming a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. She was concerned at the low standard of care and lack of specialisation in the needs of female patients, and so obtained a post at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson&#x27;s pioneering New Hospital for Women in London, and then at the Rotunda in Dublin, a leading maternity hospital. Inglis gained her MBChM qualification in 1899, from the University of Edinburgh, after it opened its medical courses to women. Her return to Edinburgh to start this course had coincided with nursing her father in his final illness before he died on 4 March 1894, aged 73. Inglis at the time noted that &#x27;he did not believe that death was the stopping-place, but that one would go on growing and learning through all eternity&#x27;.

Inglis later acknowledged that &#x27;whatever I am, whatever I have done – I owe it all to my father&#x27;.

==Career==
===Medical practice===
Inglis returned to Edinburgh in 1894, completed her medical degree and became a lecturer in gynaecology at the Medical College for Women and then set up a medical practice with Jessie MacLaren MacGregor, who had been a fellow student. Considering that women and children&#x27;s medicine was under resourced, they opened a maternity hospital, named &quot;The Hospice&quot;, for poor women alongside a midwifery resource and training centre, initially in George Square. The Hospice was then provided with an accident and general service as well as maternity, with an operating theatre and eight beds, in new premises at 219 High Street, on the Royal Mile, close to Cockburn Street, and was the forerunner of the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital. In 1913, Inglis travelled across to the USA (Michigan) to visit and learn from a new type of maternity hospital.

Inglis often waived the fees owed to her and would pay for her patients to recuperate by the sea-side, with polio being a particular childhood illness she was concerned with. Inglis was a consultant at Bruntsfield Hospital, a nearby hospital for women and children, and the Hospice merged with them in 1910.

Inglis&#x27;s surgical skills were recognised by colleagues as &quot;she was quiet, calm, and collected, and never at a loss, skilful in her manipulations, and able to cope with any emergency.&quot;

Inglis lived and was in a relationship for some time with Flora Murray, a fellow doctor and suffragette.

=== Suffrage movement ===

Her dissatisfaction with the standard of medical care available to women led her to political activism through the suffrage movement. She was the secretary of the Edinburgh National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage in the 1890s, supported by her father, and while she was working toward her medical degree.

Inglis worked closely with Millicent Fawcett, the leader of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (the NUWSS), speaking at events all over the country. By 1906, &quot;Elsie Inglis was to the Scottish groups what Mrs. Fawcett was to the English; when they too formed themselves that year into a Federation, it was Elsie who became its secretary.&quot; From the early years of the Scottish Federation of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, Inglis was honorary secretary from 1906 and continued in this role right up to 1914.

Inglis spoke in support of suffrage in 1907 with Chrystal MacMillan and Alice Low as fellow speakers, at a NUWSS meeting in Edinburgh&#x27;s Café Oak Hall. Jessie Scott from New Zealand, where women already had the vote was also a guest speaker.

A century later, in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Lucy Inglis (a relative) noted Inglis had said &#x27;fate had placed her in the van of a great movement&#x27; and was a &#x27;keen fighter&#x27;. Inglis&#x27;s personal style was described by fellow suffragist Sarah Mair as &#x27;courteous, sweet-voiced&#x27; with &#x27;the eyes of a seer&#x27;, a &#x27;radiant smile&#x27; when her lips were not &#x27;firmly closed with a fixity of purpose such as would warn off unwarrantable opposition or objections...&#x27;

===First World War===
Although she had already had turned 50 at the start of the conflict, it was during the First World War that she made her mark. Despite government resistance, Inglis established the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals for Foreign Service Committee, an organisation funded by the women&#x27;s suffrage movement to provide all female staffed relief hospitals for the Allied war effort, including doctors and technical staff (paid) and others including nurses and transport staff and others as volunteers.

Inglis wanted a neutral name in order to attract &quot;wide support from men and women&quot;. but was able to use her connections to the suffrage movement to raise money for what became the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals (SWH). Inglis approached the Scottish Red Cross to help with funding, but the head of the Scottish Red Cross, Sir George Beatson denied Inglis&#x27; request stating that the Red Cross was in the hands of the War Office and he could have &quot;nothing to say to a hospital staffed by women.&quot; To start the project, &quot;she opened a fund with £100 of her own money.&quot; Milicent Fawcett, of NUWSS took up the cause and invited Inglis to speak about the SWH in London, and by the next month, Inglis had her first £1,000. The goal was £50,000. Collection boxes had the NUWSS logo in small print, one is held in the National Museum of Scotland.

The organisation was active in sending eventually 14 teams to Belgium, France, Serbia and Russia.

When Inglis approached the Royal Army Medical Corps to offer them a ready-made medical unit staffed by qualified women, the War Office told her, &quot;my good lady, go home and sit still.&quot; It was, instead, the French government that took up her offer and established a unit in France and then she led her own unit in Serbia. Inglis was involved in all aspects of the organisation of this service down to the colours of the uniform, &#x27;a hodden grey, with Gordon tartan facings&#x27;. The French hospital was based at the Abbey of Royaumont and was run by Frances Ivens from January 1915 to March 1919. Inglis had initially offered a 100-bed hospital but it grew to hold 600 beds as it coped with the severity of battles, including that on the Somme.

Inglis went with the teams sent to Serbia, to work in improving hygiene which reduced typhus and other epidemics there. On her journey, she was to enjoy a last peaceful day of sunshine and starlight on the voyage. The typhus outbreak in Serbia affected the hospital, and eventually took the lives of four of the SWH staff, including Nurse Louisa Jordan, after whom the coronavirus pandemic hospital in Glasgow was named in 2020. Four SWH units in Serbia were established but in 1915 Inglis was captured, when the Austro-Hungarian and German forces took over the region, as she had stayed behind with others to repatriate the wounded. Inglis was taken prisoner when at Krushevatz (Kruševac) Hospital in Serbia. Inglis and others were repatriated via neutral Switzerland in February 1916, but upon reaching Scotland, she at once began organising funds for a Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospital team in Russia. She headed the Scots team when it left in August 1916 for Odessa, Russia. She had appointed two fellow Scottish suffragists, Mary H. J. Henderson as administrator, and Evelina Haverfield as commandant for the new unit. The two SWH units were overcome in the chaos of a retreat with Inglis travelling via Dobruja to Braila, on the Danube with the people in flight, including families, doctors, soldiers and a Romanian officer who had been in Glasgow and knew &quot;British &quot;custims&quot;&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;). The Scottish women&#x27;s journeys and challenging experiences in Serbia were shared by her administrator, Henderson in national and local press and in fundraising talks once she returned home. Inglis was said, in the chaos, to think of her homeland &#x27;there, quiet, strong and invincible, behind everything and everyone&#x27;.

At Braila with just six other doctors, only one surgeon, Inglis and team were treating 11,000 wounded soldiers and sailors. A letter in tribute to Inglis, in the name of &quot;The Russian Citizen Soldiers&quot; was written at Easter to &quot;express our sincere gratitude for all the care and attention bestowed on us, and we bow low before the tireless and wonderful work of yourself and your personnel, which we see every day directed towards the good of the soldiers allied to your country&quot;. Inglis got the news that her nephew was shot in the head and blinded on the day that she was leaving for Reni (Ukraine). She questioned the eternal battle of good and evil referred to in wartime, when she wrote to her sister expressing her sorrow for her nephew, ending with &quot;we are just here in it, and whatever we lose, it is for the right we are standing...it is all terrible and awful, and I don&#x27;t believe we can disentangle it all in our minds just now. The only thing is just to go on doing our bit.&quot;

Inglis, &quot;an indomitable little figure&quot; lasted another summer in Russia, before she too was forced to return in poor health to the United Kingdom, dying almost on arrival, suffering from bowel cancer. On her final journey, she was seen to stand on deck saying a farewell to each of the Serb officers being evacuated &quot;in quiet dignity.&quot;

==Death and legacy==


Inglis died on 26 November 1917, the day after she arrived back in Britain, with her sisters at her bedside at the Station Hotel, Newcastle upon Tyne.

Inglis&#x27;s body lay in state at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, and her funeral there on 29 November was attended by both British and Serbian royalty. The service included the &#x27;Hallelujah Chorus&#x27; and the Last Post played by the buglers of the Royal Scots. The streets were lined with people as her coffin went through Edinburgh to be buried at the Dean Cemetery. &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper wrote that it was an &quot;occasion of an impressive public tribute&quot;. Winston Churchill said of Inglis and her nurses &quot;they will shine in history.&quot;

In London, a subsequent memorial service, attended by members of the royal families of Britain and Serbia, was held at St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Westminster, the Anglican parish church of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

Inglis is buried in the north section of Dean Cemetery, on a corner north of the central path. Her parents, John Forbes David Inglis (1820–1894) and Harriet Lowes Thompson (1827–1885), as well as her cousin, Sir Henry Simson, lie nearby in the same cemetery.

A memorial fountain was erected in Inglis&#x27;s memory in Mladenovac, Serbia, commemorating her work for the country. A plaque marking her pre-war surgery from 1898 to 1914 was erected at 8 Walker Street, Edinburgh. A portrait of her is included in the mural of heroic women by Walter P. Starmer unveiled in 1921 in the church of St Jude-on-the-Hill in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London. In 1922 a large tablet to her memory (sculpted by Pilkington Jackson) was erected in the north aisle of St Giles Cathedral, in Edinburgh.

Her main physical memorial was the building of the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital in 1925 which was operational until 1988. Many Edinburgh children were born there during the 20th century. It was closed by the National Health Service in 1988 and sold off. Part of it is now an old people&#x27;s home, part is private housing, and parts are demolished; it is no longer recognisable as a hospital. At its closure there were public protests that a new maternity unit should also be named after Inglis, which has not yet happened (2020). A small plaque to Elsie Inglis exists near the south-west corner at the entrance to Holyrood Park.

A nursing career development scheme in NHS Lothian is called &quot;&#x27;the Elsies&quot;&#x27;.

Inglis was commemorated on a new series of banknotes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in 2009; her image appeared on the new issue of £50 notes. In March 2015, the British Residence in Belgrade was renamed &quot;&#x27;Elsie Inglis House&quot;&#x27; in recognition of her work in the country. The ceremony was conducted by the President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic and the UK Ambassador Denis Keefe said&quot;Elsie Inglis was one of the first women in Scotland who had finished high education and was a pioneer of medicine. She fought energetically against prejudice, for social and political emancipation of women in Britain. She was also a tireless volunteer, courageous organiser of the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals and a dedicated humanitarian. Unfortunately, Elsie Inglis didn&#x27;t live long enough to see the triumph of some of her ideas, but she has had a tremendous influence on social trends in our country. In Scotland she became a doctor, in Serbia she became a saint.&quot;In 2020 it was noted that Serbia&#x27;s first palliative care hospice will also be named after Elsie Inglis.

In November 2017, a memorial plaque to Elsie Inglis and 15 women who died as a result of their service to the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals was set in Edinburgh Central Library.

Inglis&#x27;s name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

The Women&#x27;s Roll of Honour plaque in York Minster also includes Inglis&#x27; name.

Inglis&#x27;s younger sister Eva Helen Shaw McLaren wrote her biography &quot;Elsie Inglis, The Woman With the Torch&quot; in 1920, and in 2009 a coloured illustrated edition was published, a reference is to Florence Nightingale known as &#x27;The Lady of the Lamp&#x27;. The Project Gutenberg has published the former book.

In Eva&#x27;s papers was found an unpublished manuscript novel by Inglis, &#x27;The Story of a Modern Woman&#x27;, whose heroine, Hildeguard Forrest, may be seen as autobiographical in part, and in a boating accident the narrator says &#x27;in a sudden flash...[she] suddenly realised she wasn&#x27;t a coward&#x27;.

Inglis was described as one of the &#x27;greatest-ever&#x27; Scottish women, &#x27;a great role model and someone young Scots can be proud of&#x27;. A journalist called unsuccessfully on the Scottish Ministers to name Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Hospital for Children and Young People after Elsie Inglis.

Sir Winston Churchill wrote of the SWH: &#x27;No body of women has won a higher reputation in the Great War...their work, lit up by the fame of Dr. Inglis, will shine in history&#x27;.

===Statue===
The Lord Provost of Edinburgh launched a plan to make a permanent memorial to Inglis in the city in November 2021. There are more than 43 statues of men in Edinburgh city centre but only two statues of women, and on the Royal Mile itself (the site for Elsie&#x27;s statue) there are twelve statues of men, and Elsie&#x27;s will be the first statue of a woman. There was a campaign to raise the £47,500 funding for the memorial statue, virtual tours (through a QR code on the statue) and other ways to commemorate &quot;a truly revered and treasured figure in Edinburgh&#x27;s history&quot;.

As part of this campaign, an event was held by Girlguiding Scotland on 5 March 2022, in the Meadows in Edinburgh. This event was a sponsored &#x27;sit still&#x27;, with lots of activities sitting still, such as badge making, first aid and making a shelter from sticks. At this event, there was also a bespoke Elsie Inglis bus tour, provided by Edinburgh Bus Tours, that visited areas linked to Elsie Inglis around Edinburgh. This event was to raise funds for the memorial statue for Elsie, raise awareness and inspire the people of Girlguiding Scotland to do anything they put their mind to. Girlguiding Scotland also created an Elsie Inglis Challenge Pack. Girlguiding Scotland also created an accompanying badge for when members complete some activities from the Challenge Pack.

By May 2022, this crowd-funding drive by Thea Laurie and Fiona Garwood, raised £50,000, by engaging politicians and organisations and public figures like author, Sara Sheridan, tennis coach Judy Murray, scientist Linda Bauld and MSP Jenni Minto, as well as the Lord Provost. They said &#x27;&quot;Dr Inglis is the perfect representative for women in Edinburgh. Her achievements in philanthropy and her efforts during World War One are just exceptional. She was a woman who would not be told to sit still and know her place.&quot; It will be built on the site of her first hospital at 219 High Street, Edinburgh. A competition for the design of the statue was launched, but on 17 October 2022 the charity&#x27;s trustees announced that they had decided to cancel the contest and award the commission to Alexander Stoddart, the King&#x27;s Sculptor in Ordinary. The announcement was met with criticism, and the trustees &#x27;paused&#x27; the process to reflect on feedback and to consider their options.
=== Commemorative Stamp ===
In December 2015, the British Embassy in Serbia partnered with the Serbia Post to launch a series of six stamps commemorating &quot;British Heroines of the First World War in Serbia&quot;. Dr Elsie Inglis was included in the series along with Captain Flora Sandes, Evelina Haverfield, Dr Elizabeth Ross, Dr Katherine MacPhail, and Dr Isabel Emslie Hutton.

==Awards and honours==
In April 1916, Inglis became the first woman to be awarded the Order of the White Eagle (First class) by the Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia at a ceremony in London. She had previously been awarded the Order of Saint Sava (III class). Her name appears on the screens commemorating the 1,513 women who lost their lives in the First World War as part of the Five Sisters window in York Minster.

== Further information ==
Mary H. J. Henderson, who had helped set up the hospitals and also served with Inglis in Russia, wrote a poem &quot;&#x27;In Memoriam: Elsie Maud Inglis&quot;&#x27;, Henderson&#x27;s poem described Inglis as a heroine.

Gary Mill&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;My Good Lady&quot; is a dramatised account of Inglis&#x27;s service with the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals for Foreign Service in the Balkans during World War 1.

<doc id="842059" wikidata="Q4006775" url="?curid=842059" title="Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union">
<text>There was systematic political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, based on the interpretation of political opposition or dissent as a psychiatric problem. It was called &quot;psychopathological mechanisms&quot; of dissent.

During the leadership of General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, psychiatry was used to disable and remove from society political opponents (&quot;dissidents&quot;) who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted the official dogma. The term &quot;philosophical intoxication&quot;, for instance, was widely applied to the mental disorders diagnosed when people disagreed with the country&#x27;s Communist leaders and, by referring to the writings of the Founding Fathers of Marxism–Leninism—Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin—made them the target of criticism.

Article 58-10 of the Stalin-era Criminal Code, &quot;Anti-Soviet agitation&quot;, was to a considerable degree preserved in the new 1958 RSFSR Criminal Code as Article 70 &quot;Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda&quot;. In 1967, a weaker law, Article 190-1 &quot;Dissemination of fabrications known to be false, which defame the Soviet political and social system&quot;, was added to the RSFSR Criminal Code. These laws were frequently applied in conjunction with the system of diagnosis for mental illness, developed by academician Andrei Snezhnevsky. Together, they established a framework within which non-standard beliefs could easily be defined as a criminal offence and the basis, subsequently, for a psychiatric diagnosis.

== Applying the diagnosis ==
The &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; political behavior of some individuals – being outspoken in their opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, and writing critical books – were defined simultaneously as criminal acts (e.g., a violation of Articles 70 or 190–1), symptoms of mental illness (e.g., &quot;delusion of reformism&quot;), and susceptible to a ready-made diagnosis (e.g., &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;). Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;.

The psychiatric incarceration of certain individuals was prompted by their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities. In accordance with the doctrine of state atheism, the religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, was considered to be a form of mental illness that required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosis, in order to discredit dissidence as the product of unhealthy minds and to avoid the embarrassment caused by public trials. Highly classified government documents that became available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.

According to the &quot;Commentary&quot; to the post-Soviet &quot;Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care&quot;, individuals forced to undergo treatment in Soviet psychiatric medical institutions were entitled to rehabilitation in accordance with the established procedure and could claim compensation. The Russian Federation acknowledged that before 1991 psychiatry had been used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of &quot;political psychiatry.&quot;

The political abuse of psychiatry in Russia has continued, nevertheless, since the fall of the Soviet Union, and human rights activists may still face the threat of a psychiatric diagnosis for their legitimate civic and political activities.

== Background ==

=== Definitions ===

Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society. It entails the exculpation and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria. Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms &quot;Soviet political psychiatry&quot; or &quot;punitive psychiatry&quot; to refer to this phenomenon.

In his book &quot;Punitive Medicine&quot; (1979) Alexander Podrabinek defined the term &quot;punitive medicine&quot;, which is identified with &quot;punitive psychiatry,&quot; as &quot;a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means.&quot; Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to serve the diktats of power. Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.

As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman wrote in their joint &quot;A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters&quot;, &quot;the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent... as a psychiatric problem.&quot;

=== An inherent capacity for abuse ===
The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.

In the period from the 1960s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.

In the Soviet Union, dissidents were often confined in psychiatric wards commonly called &quot;psikhushkas&quot;. &quot;Psikhushka&quot; is the Russian ironic diminutive for &quot;psychiatric hospital&quot;. One of the first penal &quot;psikhushkas&quot; was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of Kazan. In 1939, it was transferred to the control of the NKVD (the secret police and precursor of the KGB) on the orders of Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the NKVD. International human rights defenders such as Walter Reich have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in &quot;Psikhushka&quot; hospitals diagnosed schizophrenia in political dissenters. Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.

=== Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev ===

As early as 1948, the Soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime.

Punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from the Stalin era, however, according to Alexander Etkind. The Gulag, or Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, was an effective instrument of political repression. There was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and more expensive psychiatric substitute. The abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of the later Soviet era. From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, the structure of the USSR mental health service conformed to the double standard in society, being represented by two distinct systems which co-existed peacefully for the most part, despite periodic conflicts between them:
# system one was that of punitive psychiatry. It directly served the authorities and those in power, and was headed by the Moscow Institute for Forensic Psychiatry named in honour of Vladimir Serbsky;
# system two was made up of elite, psychotherapeutically oriented clinics. It was headed by the Leningrad Psychoneurological Institute named in memory of Vladimir Bekhterev.
The hundreds of hospitals in the provinces combined elements of both systems.

If someone was mentally ill then, they were sent to psychiatric hospitals and confined there until they died. If their mental health was uncertain but they were not constantly unwell, they and their &quot;kharakteristika&quot; [testimonial from employers, the Party and other Soviet institutions] were sent to a labour camp or to be shot. When allusions to socialist legality started to be made, it was decided to prosecute such people. Soon it became apparent that putting people who gave anti-Soviet speeches on trial only made matters worse for the regime. Such individuals were no longer tried in court. Instead they were given a psychiatric examination and declared insane.

== The Joint Session, October 1951 ==

In the 1950s, the psychiatrists of the Soviet Union turned themselves into the medical arm of the Gulag State. A precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in the Soviet Union, the &quot;Joint Session&quot; of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Neurological and Psychiatric Association took place from 10 to 15 October 1951. The event was dedicated, supposedly, to the great Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, and alleged that several of the USSR&#x27;s leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of the time (among them Grunya Sukhareva, Vasily Gilyarovsky, Raisa Golant, Aleksandr Shmaryan, and Mikhail Gurevich) were guilty of practicing &quot;anti-Pavlovian, anti-Marxist, idealistic [and] reactionary&quot; science, and this was damaging to Soviet psychiatry.

During the Joint Session, these eminent psychiatrists, motivated by fear, had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous and they also had to promise to conform to &quot;Pavlovian&quot; doctrines. These public declarations of obedience proved insufficient. In the closing speech, Andrei Snezhnevsky, the lead author of the Session&#x27;s policy report, stated that the accused psychiatrists &quot;have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions&quot;, thereby causing &quot;grave damage to the Soviet psychiatric research and practice&quot;. The vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them of &quot;diligently worshipping the dirty source of American pseudo-science&quot;. Those who articulated these accusations at the Joint Session – among them Irina Strelchuk, Vasily Banshchikov, Oleg Kerbikov, and Snezhnevsky – were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions. Not surprisingly, many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after the session.

The Joint Session also had a negative impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions. In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison. The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel. The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come. Pseudo-science took control.

Following a previous joint session of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (28 June–4 July 1950) and the 10-15 October 1951 joint session of the Presidium of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists, Snezhnevky&#x27;s school was given the leading role. The 1950 decision to give monopoly over psychiatry to the Pavlovian school of Snezhnevsky was one of the crucial factors in the rise of political psychiatry. The Soviet doctors, under the incentive of Snezhnevsky, devised a &quot;Pavlovian theory of schizophrenia&quot; and increasingly applied this diagnostic category to political dissidents.

== &quot;Sluggish schizophrenia&quot; ==

Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. It was the diagnosis of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; that was most prominently used in cases of dissidents. Sluggish schizophrenia as one of the new diagnostic categories was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system. According to the Global Initiative on Psychiatry chief executive Robert van Voren, the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the conception that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally sick since there was no other logical rationale why one would oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world. The diagnosis &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;, a longstanding concept further developed by the Moscow School of Psychiatry and particularly by its chief Snezhnevsky, furnished a very handy framework for explaining this behavior.

The weight of scholarly opinion holds that the psychiatrists who played the primary role in the development of this diagnostic concept were following directives from the Communist Party and the Soviet secret service, or KGB, and were well aware of the political uses to which it would be put. Nevertheless, for many Soviet psychiatrists &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; appeared to be a logical explanation to apply to the behavior of critics of the regime who, in their opposition, seemed willing to jeopardize their happiness, family, and career for a reformist conviction or ideal that was so apparently divergent from the prevailing social and political orthodoxy.

Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria. A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of psychopathy, hypochondria, depersonalization or anxiety were central to it. Symptoms referred to as part of the &quot;negative axis&quot; included pessimism, poor social adaptation, and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms&quot;. According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye. Thereby patients with non-psychotic mental disorders, or even persons who were not mentally sick, could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia. Along with paranoia, sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters. As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, schizophrenia was held to be much more prevalent than previously considered, for the illness might present with comparatively slight symptoms, and might only progress afterwards. As a consequence, schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries, as &quot;the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia&quot; reported in 1973. The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow. In particular, the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense. Their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character. The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society. Thereby, sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as &quot;reform delusions&quot;, &quot;perseverance&quot;, and &quot;struggle for the truth&quot;. As Viktor Styazhkin reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient &quot;develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an academy of human happiness, and many other projects for the benefit of mankind&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which contained ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred critique of the political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct. Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.

On the covert orders of the KGB, thousands of social and political reformers—Soviet &quot;dissidents&quot;—were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;, a disease fabricated by Snezhnevsky and &quot;Moscow school&quot; of psychiatry. American psychiatrist Alan A. Stone stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry aimed at Snezhnevsky personally, because he was essentially responsible for the Soviet concept of schizophrenia with a &quot;sluggish type&quot; manifestation by &quot;reformerism&quot; including other symptoms. One can readily apply this diagnostic scheme to dissenters. Snezhnevsky was long attacked in the West as an exemplar of psychiatric abuse in the USSR. The leading critics implied that Snezhnevsky had designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia and this diagnosis to make political dissent into a mental disease. He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis which could be bent for political purposes, and he himself diagnosed or was involved in a series of famous dissident cases, and, in dozens of cases, he personally signed a commission decision on legal insanity of mentally healthy dissidents including Vladimir Bukovsky, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Leonid Plyushch, Mikola Plakhotnyuk, and Pyotr Grigorenko.

== Beginning of the trend toward mass abuse ==

=== From Khrushchev to Andropov ===
The campaign to declare political opponents mentally sick and to commit dissenters to mental hospitals began in the late 1950s and early 1960s. As Vladimir Bukovsky commented on the emergence of the political abuse of psychiatry, Nikita Khrushchev reckoned that it was impossible for people in a socialist society to have an anti-socialist consciousness. Whenever manifestations of dissidence could not be justified as a provocation of world imperialism or a legacy of the past, they were self-evidently the product of mental disease. In a speech published in the &quot;Pravda&quot; daily newspaper on 24 May 1959, Khrushchev said:

The now available evidence supports the conclusion that the system of political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by the KGB to rid the USSR of undesirable elements. According to several available documents and a message by a former general of the Fifth (dissident) Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB to Robert van Voren, political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.

Andropov was in charge of the wide-ranging deployment of psychiatric repression from the moment he was appointed to head the KGB. He became KGB Chairman on 18 May 1967. On 3 July 1967, he made a proposal to establish a Fifth Directorate (ideological counterintelligence) within the KGB to deal with internal political opposition to the Soviet regime. The Directorate was set up at the end of July and took charge of KGB files on all Soviet dissidents, including Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In 1968, KGB Chairman Andropov issued a departmental order &quot;On the tasks of State security agencies in combating the ideological sabotage by the adversary&quot;, calling for the KGB to struggle against dissidents and their imperialist masters. His aim was &quot;the destruction of dissent in all its forms&quot; and he insisted that the positions of the capitalist countries on human rights, and their criticisms of the Soviet Union and its own politics of human rights from these positions, was just one part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the Soviet state&#x27;s foundation. Similar ideas can be found in the 1983 book &quot;Speeches and Writings&quot; by Andropov published when he had become General Secretary of the CPSU:
=== Implementation and the legal framework ===
On 29 April 1969, Andropov submitted an elaborate plan to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to set up a network of mental hospitals that would defend the &quot;Soviet Government and the socialist order&quot; from dissenters. To persuade his fellow Politburo members of the risk posed by the mentally ill, Andropov circulated a report from the Krasnodar Region. A secret resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers was adopted. Andropov&#x27;s proposal to use psychiatry for struggle against dissenters was adopted and implemented.

In 1929, the USSR had 70 psychiatric hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935, this had increased to 102 psychiatric hospitals and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric beds in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974, the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion in the number of psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.

On 15 May 1969, a Soviet Government decree (No. 345–209) was issued &quot;On measures for preventing dangerous behavior (acts) on the part of mentally ill persons.&quot; This decree confirmed the practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists. Soviet psychiatrists were told whom they should examine and were assured that they might detain these individuals with the help of the police or entrap them into coming to the hospital. The psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers. Doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting the individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution.

By the end of the 1950s, confinement to a psychiatric institution had become the most commonly used method of punishing leaders of the political opposition. In the 1960s and 1970s, the trials of dissenters and their referral for &quot;treatment&quot; to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals under MVD control and oversight came out into the open, and the world learned of a wave of &quot;psychiatric terror&quot; which was flatly denied by those in charge of the Serbsky Institute. The bulk of psychiatric repression spans the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. As CPSU General Secretary, from November 1982 to February 1984, Yury Andropov demonstrated little patience with domestic dissafection and continued the Brezhnev Era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals.

== Examination and hospitalization ==
Political dissidents were usually charged under Articles 70 (agitation and propaganda against the Soviet state) and 190-1 (dissemination of false fabrications defaming the Soviet state and social system) of the RSFSR Criminal Code. Forensic psychiatrists were asked to examine offenders whose mental state was considered abnormal by the investigating officers.

In almost every case, dissidents were examined at the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry in Moscow, where persons being prosecuted in court for committing political crimes were subjected to a forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation. Once certified, the accused and convicted were sent for involuntary treatment to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals controlled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

The accused had no right of appeal. The right was given to their relatives or other interested persons but they were not allowed to nominate psychiatrists to take part in the evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally credible before the law.

According to dissident poet Naum Korzhavin, the atmosphere at the Serbsky Institute in Moscow altered almost overnight when Daniil Lunts took over as head of the Fourth Department (otherwise known as the Political Department). Previously, psychiatric departments were regarded as a &#x27;refuge&#x27; against being dispatched to the Gulag. Now that policy altered. The first reports of dissenters being hospitalized on non-medical grounds date from the early 1960s, not long after Georgy Morozov was appointed director of the Serbsky Institute. Both Morozov and Lunts were personally involved in numerous well-known cases and were notorious abusers of psychiatry for political purposes. Most prisoners, in Viktor Nekipelov&#x27;s words, characterized Daniil Lunts as &quot;no better than the criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on the prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.&quot;

A well-documented practice was the use of psychiatric hospitals as temporary prisons during the two or three weeks around the 7 November (October Revolution) Day and May Day celebrations, to isolate &quot;socially dangerous&quot; persons who otherwise might protest in public or manifest other deviant behavior.

== Struggle against abuse ==

In the 1960s, a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced in the course of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City (1971), Hawaii (1977), Vienna (1983) and Athens (1989). The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.

== Classification of the victims ==
Upon analysis of over 200 well-authenticated cases covering the period 1962–1976, Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway developed a classification of the victims of Soviet psychiatric abuse. They were classified as:
# advocates of human rights or democratization;
# nationalists;
# would-be emigrants;
# religious believers;
# citizens inconvenient to the authorities.
The advocates of human rights and democratization, according to Bloch and Reddaway, made up about half the dissidents repressed by means of psychiatry. Nationalists made up about one-tenth of the dissident population dealt with psychiatrically. Would-be emigrants constituted about one-fifth of dissidents victimized by means of psychiatry. People detained only because of their religious activity made up about fifteen per cent of dissident-patients. Citizens inconvenient to the authorities because of their &quot;obdurate&quot; complaints about bureaucratic excesses and abuses accounted for about five per cent of dissidents subject to psychiatric abuse.

== Incomplete figures ==
In 1985, Peter Reddaway and Sidney Bloch provided documented data on some five hundred cases in their book &quot;Soviet Psychiatric Abuse&quot;.

=== True scale of repression ===

On basis of the available data and materials accumulated in the archives of the International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry, one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons. From 1994 to 1995, an investigative commission of Moscow psychiatrists explored the records of five prison psychiatric hospitals in Russia and discovered about two thousand cases of political abuse of psychiatry in these hospitals alone. In 2004, Anatoly Prokopenko said he was surprised at the facts obtained by him from the official classified top secret documents by the Central Committee of the CPSU, by the KGB, and MVD. According to his calculations based on what he found in the documents, about 15,000 people were confined for political crimes in the psychiatric prison hospitals under the control of the MVD. In 2005, referring to the Archives of the CPSU Central Committee and the records of the three Special Psychiatrial Hospitals — Sychyovskaya, Leningrad and Chernyakhovsk hospitals — to which human rights activists gained access in 1991, Prokopenko concluded that psychiatry had been used as punitive measure against about 20,000 people for purely political reasons. This was only a small part of the total picture, Prokopenko said. The data on the total number of people who had been held in all sixteen prison hospitals and in the 1,500 &quot;open&quot; psychiatric hospitals remains unknown because parts of the archives of the prison psychiatric hospitals and hospitals in general are classified and inaccessible. The figure of fifteen or twenty thousand political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals run by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was first put forward by Prokopenko in the 1997 book &quot;Mad Psychiatry&quot; (&quot;Безумная психиатрия&quot;), which was republished in 2005.

An indication of the extent of the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR is provided by Semyon Gluzman&#x27;s calculation that the percentage of &quot;the mentally ill&quot; among those accused of so-called anti-Soviet activities proved many times higher than among criminal offenders. The attention paid to political prisoners by Soviet psychiatrists was more than 40 times greater than their attention to ordinary criminal offenders. This derives from the following comparison: 1–2% of all the forensic psychiatric examinations carried out by the Serbsky Institute targeted those accused of anti-Soviet activities; convicted dissidents in penal institutions made up 0.05% of the total number of convicts; 1–2% is 40 times greater than 0.05%.

According to Viktor Luneyev, the struggle against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We do not know how many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment of the total number of repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).

=== Concealment of the data ===

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, the scale of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: the contents of the main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin&#x27;s time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.

Anatoly Sobchak, the former Mayor of Saint Petersburg, wrote:
In Ukraine, a study of the origins of the political abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years on the basis of the State archives. A total of 60 people were again examined. All were citizens of Ukraine, convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on the territory of Ukraine. Not one of them, it turned out, was in need of any psychiatric treatment.

From 1993 to 1995, a presidential decree on measures to prevent future abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, at the request of Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.

The report on political abuse of psychiatry prepared at the request of the commission by Gushansky with the aid of Prokopenko lay unclaimed and even the &quot;Independent Psychiatric Journal&quot; (Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal) would not publish it. The Moscow Research Center for Human Rights headed by Boris Altshuler and Alexey Smirnov and the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia whose president is Yuri Savenko were asked by Gushansky to publish the materials and archival documents on punitive psychiatry but showed no interest in doing so. Publishing such documents is dictated by present-day needs and by how far it is feared that psychiatry could again be abused for non-medical purposes.

In its 2000 report, the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression included only the following four phrases about the political abuse of psychiatry:
In the 1988 and 1989, about two million people were removed from the psychiatric registry at the request of Western psychiatrists. It was one of their conditions for the re-admission of Soviet psychiatrists to the World Psychiatric Association. Yury Savenko has provided different figures in different publications: about one million, up to one and a half million, about one and a half million people removed from the psychiatric registry. Mikhail Buyanov provided the figure of over two million people removed from the psychiatric registry.

== Theoretical analysis ==
In 1990, &quot;Psychiatric Bulletin of the Royal College of Psychiatrists&quot; published the article &quot;Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?&quot; by Russian psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin. It contains analysis of the abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which the existence of a system of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR can easily be demonstrated. As Koryagin wrote, in a dictatorial State with a totalitarian regime, such as the USSR, the laws have at all times served not the purpose of self-regulation of the life of society but have been one of the major levers by which to manipulate the behavior of subjects. Every Soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as the aim, but as a means to achieve the rulers&#x27; objectives. From the perspective of state pragmatism, a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society, using up the state&#x27;s material means without recompense and not producing anything, and even potentially capable of inflicting harm. Therefore, the Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients&#x27; life. It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them. A person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on the psychiatrists&#x27; will. Practically anybody could undergo psychiatric examination on the most senseless grounds and the issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights. It was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in the country.

According to American psychiatrist Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did not have any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient&#x27;s consent or dissent mattered not. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.

According to Yuri Savenko, the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia (the IPA), punitive psychiatry arises on the basis of the interference of three main factors:
# The ideologizing of science, its breakaway from the achievements of world psychiatry, the party orientation of Soviet forensic psychiatry.
# The lack of legal basis.
# The total nationalization of mental health service.
Their interaction system is principally sociological: the presence of the Penal Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination. Thus, it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease.

According to Larry Gostin, the root cause of the problem was the State itself. The definition of danger was radically extended by the Soviet criminal system to cover &quot;political&quot; as well as customary physical types of &quot;danger&quot;. As Bloch and Reddaway note, there are no objective reliable criteria to determine whether the person&#x27;s behavior will be dangerous, and approaches to the definition of dangerousness greatly differ among psychiatrists.

Richard Bonnie, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Law, mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state as one of the most substantial lessons from the period.

According to Norman Sartorius, a former president of the World Psychiatric Association, political abuse of psychiatry in the former Soviet Union was facilitated by the fact that the national classification included categories that could be employed to label dissenters, who could then be forcibly incarcerated and kept in psychiatric hospitals for &quot;treatment&quot;. Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the DSM-5 task force, has a similar opinion that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was sustained by the existence of a classification developed in the Soviet Union and used to organize psychiatric treatment and care. In this classification, there were categories with diagnoses that could be given to political dissenters and led to the harmful involuntary medication.

According to Moscow psychiatrist Alexander Danilin, the so-called &quot;nosological&quot; approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Snezhnevsky boils down to the ability to make the only diagnosis, schizophrenia; psychiatry is not science but such a system of opinions and people by the thousands are falling victims to these opinions—millions of lives were crippled by virtue of the concept &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; introduced some time once by an academician Snezhnevsky, whom Danilin called a state criminal.

St Petersburg academic psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky&#x27;s school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky&#x27;s hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky&#x27;s concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. However, Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.

According to American psychiatrist Walter Reich, the misdiagnoses of dissidents resulted from some characteristics of Soviet psychiatry that were distortions of standard psychiatric logic, theory, and practice.

According to Semyon Gluzman, abuse of psychiatry to suppress dissent is based on condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state. Psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence. Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian. Such psychiatry is forced to serve the two differently directed principles: care and treatment of mentally ill citizens, on the one hand, and psychiatric repression of people showing political or ideological dissent, on the other hand. In the conditions of the totalitarian state, independent-minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear, but these few people cannot change the situation in which thousands of others, who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of the state, will sincerely believe that the uninhibited, free thinking of a citizen is a symptom of madness. Gluzman specifies the following six premises for the unintentional participation of doctors in abuses:
# The specificity, in the totalitarian state, of the psychiatric paradigm tightly sealed from foreign influences.
# The lack of legal conscience in most citizens including doctors.
# Disregard for fundamental human rights on the part of the lawmaker and law enforcement agencies.
# Declaratory nature or the absence of legislative acts that regulate providing psychiatric care in the country. The USSR, for example, adopted such an act only in 1988.
# The absolute state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally gives rise to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of the doctor is based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient&#x27;s consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).
# The fact, in psychiatric hospitals, of frustratingly bad conditions, which refer primarily to the poverty of health care and inevitably lead to the dehumanization of the personnel including doctors.
Gluzman says that there, of course, may be a different approach to the issue expressed by Michel Foucault.
According to Michael Perlin, Foucault in his book &quot;Madness and Civilization&quot; documented the history of using institutional psychiatry as a political tool, researched the expanded use of the public hospitals in the 17th century in France and came to the conclusion that &quot;confinement [was an] answer to an economic crisis... reduction of wages, unemployment, scarcity of coin&quot; and, by the 18th century, the psychiatric hospitals satisfied &quot;the indissociably economic and moral demand for confinement.&quot;

In 1977, British psychiatrist David Cooper asked Foucault the same question which Claude Bourdet had formerly asked Viktor Fainberg during a press conference given by Fainberg and Leonid Plyushch: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, why do they use psychiatry? Foucault answered it was not a question of a &quot;distortion&quot; of the use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project. In the discussion &quot;Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison&quot;, Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and &quot;condensation&quot; of psychiatry&#x27;s &quot;inheritance&quot;, an &quot;intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function.&quot; Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system. In the discussion with Jean Laplanche and Robert Badinter, Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880—1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: &quot;The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it&#x27;s because he himself is upset&quot;. This led to the twofold conclusions. First, &quot;the judicial apparatus is no longer useful.&quot; The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters no better than the criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus. And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed. Second, &quot;We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him.&quot; Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic. In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies. However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union became one of the most common but by no means exceptional cases.

According to American psychiatrist Jonas Robitscher, psychiatry has been playing a part in controlling deviant behavior for three hundred years. Vagrants, &quot;originals,&quot; eccentrics, and homeless wanderers who did little harm but were vexatious to the society they lived in were, and sometimes still are, confined to psychiatric hospitals or deprived of their legal rights. Some critics of psychiatry consider the practice as a political use of psychiatry and regard psychiatry as promoting timeserving.

As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is difficult for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident&#x27;s poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.

An example of the low threshold is a point of Donetsk psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man&#x27;s social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth. In Pekhterev&#x27;s words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements. They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself. The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being. The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being as public one. They bite the society&#x27;s hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society. Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding &quot;public well-being&quot; as personal one. The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place. The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members. After reading the book &quot;Institute of Fools&quot; by Viktor Nekipelov, Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.

According to the response by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev in his article condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in a certain sense &quot;on holiday&quot; in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the &quot;gates of hell&quot; from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the &quot;treatment&quot; (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.

According to Fedor Kondratev, an expert of the Serbsky Center and supporter of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s, those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 (&quot;anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda&quot;), 190-1 (&quot;dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system&quot;) made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes. It was they who began to be searched for &quot;psychopathological mechanisms&quot; and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization as a result of the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the &quot;exclusively scientific&quot; concept of Marxism–Leninism. This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization. In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave &quot;in a different way than others do&quot; not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience. It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for &quot;psychopathological mechanisms&quot; of his dissent. Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer compulsory treatment &quot;for it&quot; in special psychiatric hospitals. What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their &quot;psychopathological mechanisms&quot;, but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks. Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, with regard to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not to take into account an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.

As Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko notes, the use of punitive psychiatry allowed of avoiding the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can be based on a preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.

German psychiatrist Hanfried Helmchen says the uncertainty of diagnosis is prone to other than medical influence, e.g., political influence, as was the case with Soviet dissenters who were stifled by a psychiatric diagnosis, especially that of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia,&quot; in order to take them away from society in special psychiatric hospitals.

According to Russian psychologist Dmitry Leontev, punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union was based on the assumption that only a madman can go against public dogma and seek for truth and justice.

K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: &quot;An important vulnerability factor, therefore, for the abuse of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends.&quot; The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power. Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone&#x27;s being deprived of property, liberty, or life. For instance, plastic surgeon&#x27;s classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient&#x27;s consent, therefore, there &quot;cannot&quot; be any political abuse of plastic surgery. The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment. What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians &quot;diagnosing&quot; the person&#x27;s condition an &quot;illness,&quot; &quot;declaring&quot; the intervention they impose on the victim a &quot;treatment,&quot; and legislators and judges &quot;legitimating&quot; these categorizations as &quot;illnesses&quot; and &quot;treatments.&quot; In the same way, physician-eugenicists advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons as a form of treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power. Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy. Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike. Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been &quot;dissidents.&quot; It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed. Before the American Civil War, dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery. In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to &quot;reform&quot; Marxism or emigrate to escape from it. As Szasz put it, &quot;the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the &quot;abuse&quot; of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use.&quot; The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the &quot;Therapeutic State&quot;, a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed (&quot;cured&quot;) through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.

As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, psychiatric power in practically all societies expands on the grounds of public safety, which, in the view of the leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence. According to Gwen Adshead, a British forensic psychotherapist at the Broadmoor Hospital, the question is what is meant by the word &quot;abnormal.&quot; Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as &quot;socially inappropriate.&quot; If that is the case, social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual&#x27;s personal problem, not a social matter.

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is the only medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence for the benefit of the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.

Vladimir Bukovsky, well known for his struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization did not have an end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years. &quot;Once they pump you with drugs, they can forget about you&quot;, he said and added, &quot;I saw people who basically were asleep for years.&quot;

US President Ronald Reagan attributed the view that the &quot;brutal treatment of Soviet dissidents was due to bureaucratic inertia.&quot;

== Residual problems ==
In the opinion of the Moscow Helsinki Group chairwoman Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When the psychiatric profession is discredited in one part of the world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely when it was abused to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.

As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today subjective position of a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence is related to the primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient&#x27;s right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.

The psychiatrist became a scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels. He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into confidence in the secrets of one&#x27;s soul and is asked to provide only medications. Psychiatric labels, or stigmas, have spread so widely that there is no such thing as the media that does not call a disliked person &quot;schizo&quot; and does not generalize psychiatric assessments to phenomena of public life. The word &quot;psikhushka&quot; entered everyday vocabulary. All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public. Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague. Vilnius psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion. Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, and you do not behave in that way. In 2007, Alexander Dugin, a professor at the Moscow State University and adviser to State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin, presented opponents of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s policy as mentally ill by saying, &quot;There are no longer opponents of Putin&#x27;s policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination.&quot; In &quot;The Moscow Regional Psychiatric Newspaper&quot; of 2012, psychiatrist Dilya Enikeyeva in violation of medical privacy and ethics publicized the diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder, which she in absentia gave Kseniya Sobchak, a Russian TV anchor and a member of political opposition, and stated that Sobchak was harmful to society.

Robert van Voren noted that after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it became apparent that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).

According to Robert van Voren, although for several years, especially after the implosion of the USSR and during the first years of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.

Throughout the post-communist period, the pharmaceutical industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform. Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.

At the turn of the century, the psychiatric reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But when it became clear that even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.

In 2005, the Russian Federation had one of the highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe&#x27;s list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need to increase the number of places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.

At his press conference in 2008, Semyon Gluzman said that the surplus in Ukraine of hospitals for inpatient treatment of the mentally ill was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children&#x27;s unit alone were more than in the whole of Great Britain. In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry. There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law. But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country. The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients. They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors. Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with red flags, portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: &quot;Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!&quot; Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system. But in general, it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists. The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless &quot;chronic patients&quot; unable to live on their own. And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert. That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications. A similar pattern is in internats. A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses. They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, &quot;halfway houses&quot;. Ukraine does not have anything like that.

In the Soviet times, mental hospitals were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, a human rights activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who have been living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.

Traditional values have largely endured attempts by Western institutions to impose a positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, in spite of the removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, in 2014 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region viewed it as an illness, and up to three-quarters viewed it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. In a 2013 inverview with TV Rain, Russia&#x27;s chief psychiatrist, Zurab Kekelidze, said that Homosexuality was continuously defined as a mental disorder by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005, when its president, Savenko, expressed his surprise at the proposal by the executive committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry. At the time he attributed this reclassification to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, called it antipsychiatric, and stated that the reasoning behind it was ideological, social and liberal rather than scientific. Savenko later changed his mind about homosexuality, and in a 2014 joint paper with Alexei Perekhov he stated that those who continue to advocate for classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder exhibit a Soviet mentality.

In 1994, a conference concerning the political abuse of psychiatry was attended by representatives from several former Soviet Republics including Russia, Belarus, the Baltics, the Caucasus, and some of the Central Asian Republics. Dainius Puras made a report on the situation within the Lithuanian Psychiatric Association, where discussion had been held but no resolution had been passed. Yuri Nuller talked over how in Russia the wind direction was gradually changing and the systematic political abuse of psychiatry was again being denied and degraded as an issue of &quot;hyperdiagnosis&quot; or &quot;scientific disagreement.&quot; Among the proponents of this revisionist view was Tatyana Dmitrieva, Director of the Serbsky Institute and a close friend of the key architects of &quot;political psychiatry.&quot;

In the early 1990s, she spoke the required words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and suppression of the human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution. Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper &quot;Chas Pik&quot; within the country. However, in her 2001 book &quot;Aliyans Prava i Milosediya&quot; (&quot;The Alliance of Law and Mercy&quot;), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries. Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and bloodshed and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime. In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of &quot;punitive psychiatry&quot; had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute. After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared &quot;patient&quot; Vladimir Bukovsky, who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly &quot;psychopathic&quot;.

While speaking of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that &quot;practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past.&quot; Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: &quot;Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It&#x27;s an organ of power.&quot; According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there. She says we have a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.

In his article of 2002, Alan A. Stone, who as a member of team had examined Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted that it was time for psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone&#x27;s words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.

Robert van Voren also says Russian psychiatry is now being headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry that was in the late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kyiv.

Many of the current leaders of Russian psychiatry, especially those who were related to the establishment in Soviet period, have resiled from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes. Among such leaders who did so is Aleksandr Tiganov, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of its Mental Health Research Center, and the chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. In 2011, when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority, Tiganov answered, &quot;These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry.&quot; According to Tiganov, it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison, but it is not true, he honestly did his medical duty. The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; he says what was attributed to Snesnevsky was that he recognized the healthy as the ill, it did not happen and is pure slander, it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person.

In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of the leading staff members of the Serbsky Center, strongly degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill. In his opinion, &quot;now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people.&quot; In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, &quot;Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know... Who? Bukovsky? I talked with him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so.&quot; In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it &quot;has never been used for political persecution.&quot; Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov&#x27;s words, &quot;are not very mentally healthy.&quot;

Russian psychiatrist Fedor Kondratev not only denied accusations that he was ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception of the existence of Soviet-era &quot;punitive psychiatry&quot; was nothing more than: &quot;the fantasy [vymysel] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [previously] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends.&quot; He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War. As Alexander Podrabinek writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public&#x27;s indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion. In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under Russian Civil Code Article 152 on protecting one&#x27;s honor, dignity and business reputation. According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions. The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia. As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, after the fall of the communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities, no matter how the doctors, if one may call them so, try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.

In 2004, Savenko stated that the passed law on the state expert activity and the introduction of the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is the only one in the country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.

According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of the main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center to get in touch over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have turned out to be a considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients&#x27; rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.

On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the State Duma a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts&#x27; findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.

On 15 June 2009, the working group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center Tatyana Dmitrieva sent the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports. The reason put forward for the proposal was that the appeals against the expert reports were allegedly filed &quot;without regard for the scope of the case&quot; and that one must appeal against the expert report &quot;only together with the sentence.&quot; In other words, according to Yuri Savenko, all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of the fact that they were infiltrated into the sentence. That is cynicism of administrative resources, cynicism of power, he says.

The draft of the application to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper &quot;Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation&quot; by Yelena Shchukina and Sergey Shishkov focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the expert report without regard for the scope of the evaluated case. While talking about appealing against &quot;the reports&quot;, the authors of the paper, according to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the &quot;parallel&quot; examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case. Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.

According to the warning made in 2010 by Yuri Savenko at the same Congress, prof. Anatoly Smulevich, author of the monographs &quot;Problema Paranoyi&quot; (&quot;The Problem of Paranoia&quot;) (1972) and &quot;Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya&quot; (&quot;Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia&quot;) (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;, again began to play the same role he played before. Recently, under his influence therapists began to widely use antidepressants and antipsychotics but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists. This situation has opened up a huge new market for pharmaceutical firms, with their unlimited capabilities, and the flow of the mentally ill to internists. Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one&#x27;s appearance and entire lifestyle.

According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky&#x27;s school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment. In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in &quot;Psychiatry. National Manual&quot; edited by Tatyana Dmitrieva, Valery Krasnov, Nikolai Neznanov, Valentin Semke, and Alexander Tiganov. In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform. As Russian sociologist Alexander Tarasov notes, you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as Anatoly Chubais or German Gref can be occupied with reforming in our country; and you are suffering from &quot;syndrome of litigiousness&quot; if in addition you wrote to the capital city complaints, which can be written only by a reviewing authority or lawyer.

According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking. For example, in some regions of Russia, 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane. In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.

In April 1995, the State Duma considered the first draft of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts&#x27; medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book &quot;Punitive Medicine&quot;, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one&#x27;s marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.

The topics vary from the taste of the cabbage served for supper to the meaning of life and Russia&#x27;s destiny. The poem was translated into English by Harry Thomas.

<text>A motor glider is a fixed-wing aircraft that can be flown with or without engine power. The FAI Gliding Commission Sporting Code definition is: a fixed-wing aerodyne equipped with a means of propulsion (MoP), capable of sustained soaring flight without thrust from the means of propulsion. 

==History==

In 1935, an occasional or auxiliary motor that could be retracted was suggested by Sir John Carden. 
This was incorporated into the Carden-Baynes Auxiliary that first flew on 8 August of the same year.
A later version of the Budig glider was powered.

==Categories==
Most motor gliders are equipped with a propeller, which may be fixed, feathered (e.g. AMS-Flight Carat), or retractable. However jet engine-powered motorgliders are now available from some manufacturers, some of which are intended for use only as &quot;sustainer&quot; engines, i.e. for sustaining gliding flight rather than as self-launching aircraft.

===Sustainer motor gliders===
Sustainer motor gliders must be launched like an unpowered glider, but can climb slowly to extend a flight once the engine is deployed and started. They generally do not have an alternator or starter motor, so the engine is started by &quot;wind-milling&quot; the propeller in flight. The propeller may be a rigid 2-blade design, or may have more than two blades that fold at the hub when the engine is retracted. The propeller hub is usually attached directly to the crankshaft, but there is at least one example of a sustainer with a belt reduction drive, the DG-1000T.

The smaller sustainer engines are usually not equipped with a throttle, but instead have a cable to open decompression valves in each cylinder to allow the engine to turn freely for starting. Sustainer engines are typically two-stroke two-cylinder air-cooled engines in the range of 18–30 hp (14–22 kW). They are lighter in weight, and simpler to operate than self-launching powerplants.

===Self-launching motor gliders===

Self-launching retractable propeller motor gliders have sufficient thrust and initial climb rate to take off without assistance, or they may be launched as with a conventional glider. The engines also have a starter motor and a large battery to allow the engine to be started on the ground, and an alternator to recharge the battery. A two-blade propeller is typically coupled to the engine via a belt reduction drive. In older designs, the propeller alignment must be checked by the pilot using a mirror, before it is retracted into the fuselage; however in current production gliders, propeller alignment is fully automatic.

Another solution is the single-blade propeller that offers the advantage of a smaller opening in the fuselage to retract the engine.

Internal combustion engines can benefit from mounting in the fuselage, rather than on the propeller mast. This allows them to be connected to a larger muffler for reduced noise when operating, something which is mostly relevant to European operation. It also allows the belt tension to be relieved when the engine is retracted to extend the life of the belt and bearings. The drawback of this arrangement is that engines fixed low in fuselages are more difficult to pre-flight and service, and highly stressed power transmission belts should not be bent or twisted.

Self-launching engines are equipped with a throttle that allows the engine power to be adjusted for ground operations. Self-launching engines are typically in the range of 50–60 hp (38–45 kW). The higher engine output power requires liquid cooling with a separate radiator mounted on the propeller mast. Engines commonly used are two-stroke piston engines, or Wankel rotary engines.

===Touring motor gliders===

Motor with fixed or full feathering propellers are generally classified as Touring Motor Gliders (TMGs). TMGs can take off and cruise like an airplane or soar with power off, like a glider.

They are fitted with front-mounted engines, similar to a small airplane. The large wingspans of TMGs provide a moderate gliding performance, not as good as that of unpowered gliders. However TMGs are more efficient than conventional light aircraft.

Most TMGs are designed with engines of 80 to and typically cruise (under power) at 85–. Most have fuel tanks capable of holding between 50 and 100 liters (13 to 26 US gallons) of fuel, giving a range under power of up to 450 nautical miles (approximately 830 kilometers). Modern TMGs like the Phoenix Air Phoenix are capable of higher speeds and longer range under power.

Some TMGs are equipped with folding wings to allow them to fit in standard small airplane T-hangars. Tow hooks are unnecessary, since aircraft with self-launch ability do not require access to winch or tow plane for launching like a conventional glider.

Some TMGs, like the Europa or the Phoenix, can also be supplied with interchangeable wings or wingtips so that they can be flown as a standard touring aircraft as well as a TMG.

The landing gear configuration on TMGs usually incorporates two fixed main wheels, allowing it to be taxied on the ground without a wing walker. While some TMGs have only one main wheel, with auxiliary trolley wheels on the wings for taxiing, it is becoming more common to find them being manufactured with tricycle and conventional (two fixed main wheels – i.e. a &quot;tail-dragger&quot;) landing gear configurations.

Since the additional drag of the stopped propeller and landing gear reduces their gliding performance, TMGs are seldom used in competition.

==Motor configurations==

===Retractable propeller===

The retractable propeller is usually mounted on a mast that rotates up and forward out of the fuselage, aft of the cockpit and wing carry-through structure. The fuselage has engine bay doors that open and close automatically, similar to landing gear doors. The engine may be near the top or bottom of the mast, and newer designs have the engine fixed in the fuselage to reduce noise and drag.

Unlike TMGs, most gliders with retractable propellers are also fitted with a tow-hook for aero-towing or ground launch. They have a single-axle retractable main wheel on the fuselage like most unpowered gliders, so they do require assistance during ground operations. The two-stroke engines commonly used are not efficient at reduced power for level cruising flight, and instead must use a &quot;saw-tooth&quot; flight profile where the glider climbs at full power, then glides with the propeller retracted.

===Cross-over===
On the Stemme S10, the propeller folds into the nose cone, and is connected to the rear-mounted engine with a drive shaft. It also has two retractable main wheels, allowing it to be taxied without assistance, and to soar with low drag. These features make it a cross-over between the touring and retractable propeller motor gliders. It does not have a tow-hook, so it must self-launch. The S10-VT variant has a two-position variable-pitch propeller and a turbocharger on the engine, which allows the aircraft to cruise at altitudes up to 30,000 feet (9,000 m).

On the AMS Carat, the propeller folds forward, pointing straight ahead like a spear.

===Electric===
Although most motor gliders have gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines, a number of electric-powered self-launchers have been developed including the Lange Antares 20E and 23E, Schempp-Hirth Arcus E, Schleicher AS 34Me, Pipistrel Taurus Electro G2, Silent 2 Targa LE (Lithium Electric), and the closely related Air Energy AE1 Silent, Yuneec Apis 2, Yuneec EViva, Alpaero Exel, Aériane Swift, Electravia and Alatus AL12. Some types use a pylon behind the cockpit to extend a propeller. 11 different types, from 7 manufacturers, such as the Alisport Silent 2 Electro, use the front electric sustainer (FES) system with a folding propeller in the nose.

Advantages of electric power over gasoline include:
* Faster and more reliable transition from gliding to powered flight, as the time and risk required to start and warm up an internal combustion engine is eliminated. For example, the Antares 20E transitions from gliding to powered flight in under 12 seconds. With a FES system maximum power can be available in 1–2 seconds.
* For types that use a pylon, lower drag and sink rate are achieved with the pylon extended and the motor not running, as there is no radiator as required to cool a gasoline engine. For FES systems, the drag from the folded propeller in the nose is negligible if the engine does not start. For safe operation, the &quot;Engine out and not running&quot; performance is used to plan in-air restarts in the event of a problem (even for electrics). The reduced sink-rate of electric-powered motor-gliders &quot;engine out and not running&quot; allows a lower altitude for a safe in-air restart.
* For types that use a pylon, belt reduction drive and associated reliability issues are eliminated. As an electric motor can turn at a lower RPM than typical gasoline engines, it can be mounted at the top of the mast without a reduction system, eliminating belt-drive issues.
* Greatly reduced noise, allowing take-off from locations where other powered aircraft are not permitted.
Disadvantages of current electric powered motor-gliders as compared to gasoline include:
* Reduced range or climb altitude, as the energy stored per unit weight for available batteries is less than gasoline.
* Gliders with pylon-mounted electric motors are slightly heavier than those with gasoline engines due to the batteries. An FES system weighs about the same as a two-stroke engine.
* Increased cost. While electric motors are comparably inexpensive, low-weight batteries suitable for motor-gliders are a little more expensive than gasoline engines.

Electric sustainer systems (with power to sustain flight but not self-launch) are optional for the Schempp-Hirth Ventus-3, HPH Shark and ESAG LAK-17B. These three all use the FES as used for self-launching lighter gliders, such as the Alisport Silent 2.

===Jet===

The first production self-launching motor glider fitted with a jet engine was the Caproni Vizzola Calif. The jet engine was mounted inside the fuselage behind the wing, with fixed intake and exhaust ducts coupled to the outside air stream for engine operation. Since then a new generation of jets have been offered for the Schempp-Hirth Ventus 2, Jonker JS-1 Revelation and the HpH 304, all featuring sustainer jet engines.

Other self-launching types include the experimental LET L-13TJ Blaník, a version of the Alisport Silent Club and a version of the TeST TST-14 Bonus.

==Use of engines in self-launching sailplanes==

The engine cannot always be relied upon to start in flight, so the pilot must allow for this possibility. The generally accepted practice is to get in position for landing at a suitable airport, or off-airport out-landing field, before extending the propeller and attempting an engine start. This allows for a safe landing in the event that the engine cannot be started in time.

In soaring competitions, starting the engine is usually scored the same as an out-landing in an unpowered glider. To detect the use of the engine, GNSS Flight Recorders used in motor gliders must have a noise sensor that allows recording the sound level along with position and altitude. In many competitions, the rules require that the pilot start the engine at the beginning of the flight, before starting the task, to ensure an engine start later in the flight will be detected.
Gliders without an engine are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for an engine-start, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. So, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine to extend a flight if conditions will no longer support soaring, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider&#x27;s trailer.

The presence of an engine can increase the safety of gliding, as a powerplant increases the ability of the pilot to avoid storms and off-airport landings. An opposing view is that motor gliders are against the spirit of the sport, and, more importantly, that they sometimes give pilots a false sense of security.

Touring motor gliders are seldom used in competition, but they can be useful in training for cross-country flights. After take-off, the engine is switched off, and the trainee flies the aircraft as a glider. Landings in unfamiliar fields can be practiced while the motor idles. If the trainee chooses an inappropriate field, or misjudges the approach, the instructor can apply power and climb away safely.

==Licenses or certificates==
In Europe, powered gliders are categorized into gliders with retractable propellers/engines, which can be flown with an ordinary glider pilot license (GPL), and touring motor gliders (TMG), which require a license extension to the standard GPL. In the United Kingdom, where gliding is regulated by the British Gliding Association, pilots of self-sustaining gliders, like those of pure gliders, do not have to be licensed with the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.

In South Africa, Touring Motor Glider (TMG) is an independent National Pilots License category under Recreation Aviation, Part 62, subpart 17.

In the United States, a private glider pilot certificate allows the pilot to fly unpowered gliders, self-launching motor gliders (including touring motor gliders and gliders with retractable engines or propellers), and sustainer motor gliders. An instructor must provide instruction and sign the logbook of the pilot to authorize the launch method, which may be by airplane towing, ground launch (winches, bungee, auto tow), or, in the case of a suitable motor glider, by self-launching. In the US, motor gliders are classified as gliders, and may be operated by a glider pilot without the medical certificate required to operate an airplane.

In the United States, a powered glider may be certified for up to two occupants, up to 850 kg maximum weight, and with a maximum ratio of weight to wing span squared of 3 kg/m2. Similar requirements exist in European JAA/EASA regulations, at a maximum weight of 750 kg.

In Canada, a glider pilot license allows the pilot to fly unpowered gliders. For self-launching motor gliders (including motor gliders and gliders with retractable engines or propellers), and sustainer motor gliders an aeroplane permit or licence is required. An instructor must provide instruction and sign the logbook of the pilot to authorize the pilot to carry passengers.

<text>Forest Ray Moulton (April 29, 1872 – December 7, 1952) was an American astronomer. He was the brother of Harold G. Moulton, a noted economist.

==Biography==

He was born in Le Roy, Michigan, and was educated at Albion College. After graduating in 1894 (A.B.), he performed his graduate studies at the University of Chicago and gained a Ph.D. in 1899. At the University of Chicago he was associate in astronomy (1898–1900), instructor (1900–03), assistant professor (1903–08), associate professor (1908–12), and professor after 1912.

He is noted for being a proponent, along with Thomas Chamberlin, of the Chamberlin–Moulton planetesimal hypothesis that the planets coalesced from smaller bodies they termed planetesimals. Their hypothesis called for the close passage of another star to trigger this condensation, a concept that has since fallen out of favor.

In the first decades of the twentieth century, some additional small satellites were discovered to be in orbit around Jupiter. Dr. Moulton proposed that these were actually gravitationally-captured planetesimals. This theory has become well-accepted among astronomers.

Moulton was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1910, the American Philosophical Society in 1916, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1919.

The crater Moulton on the Moon, the Adams–Moulton methods for solving differential equations and the Moulton plane in geometry are named after him.

Moulton was a critic of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

He was in charge of ballistics at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland during World War I.

According to Craig A. Stephenson:
==Connection to Hidden Figures==

In September of 1960, Katherine Johnson used Moulton’s book, An Introduction to Celestial Mechanics, to assist her in calculating how John Glenn would return safely to Earth after his orbital flight.
This was depicted in the 2016 movie, Hidden Figures.
==Selected publications==

He became an associate editor of the &quot;Transactions of the American Mathematical Society&quot; in 1907 and a research associate of the Carnegie Institution in 1908. He served for several terms as secretary of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and edited more than twenty AAAS symposia. Besides various contributions to mathematical and astronomical journals he was the author of: 
* &quot;An Introduction to Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1902; second, revised edition, 1914)
* &quot;An Introduction to Astronomy&quot; (1906; 2nd, revised edition, 1916)
* &quot;Descriptive Astronomy&quot; (1912)
* &quot;Periodic Orbits&quot; (1920)
* &quot;New Methods in Exterior Ballistics&quot; (1926)
* &quot;Differential Equations&quot; (1930)
* &quot;Astronomy&quot; (1931)
* &quot;Consider the Heavens&quot; (1935)

<text>A fluoropolymer is a fluorocarbon-based polymer with multiple carbon–fluorine bonds. It is characterized by a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. The best known fluoropolymer is polytetrafluoroethylene under the brand name &quot;Teflon,&quot; trademarked by the DuPont Company.

==History==

In 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene (DuPont brand name Teflon) was discovered by accident by a recently hired DuPont Ph.D., Roy J. Plunkett. While working with tetrafluoroethylene gas to develop refrigerants, he noticed that a previously pressurized cylinder had no pressure remaining. In dissecting the cylinder, he found a mass of white solid in a quantity similar to that of the tetrafluoroethylene gas. It was determined that this material was a new-to-the-world polymer. Tests showed the substance was resistant to corrosion from most acids, bases and solvents and had better high temperature stability than any other plastic. By early 1941, a crash program was making substantial quantities of PTFE for the Manhattan Project.

==Properties==
Fluoropolymers share the properties of fluorocarbons in that they are not as susceptible to the van der Waals force as hydrocarbons. This contributes to their non-stick and friction reducing properties. Also, they are stable due to the stability multiple carbon–fluorine bonds add to a chemical compound. Fluoropolymers may be mechanically characterized as thermosets or thermoplastics. Fluoropolymers can be homopolymers or Copolymer. 

==Examples of monomers used to prepare fluoropolymers==
* Perfluorocycloalkene (PFCA)
* Ethylene (Ethene, E)
* Vinyl fluoride (fluoroethylene) (VF1)
* Vinylidene fluoride (1,1-difluoroethylene) (VDF or VF2)
* Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE)
* Chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE)
* Propylene (Propene, P)
* Hexafluoropropylene (HFP)
* Perfluoropropylvinylether (PPVE)
* Perfluoromethylvinylether (PMVE)

<doc id="842094" wikidata="Q2313318" url="?curid=842094" title="Battle of Chengpu">
<text>The Battle of Chengpu took place in 632 BC between the State of Jin and the State of Chu and its allies during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. It was the first major battle in the protracted conflict between the states of the Yellow River valley, and the states of the Yangtze River valley. The Jin victory confirmed the hegemony of Duke Wen and checked Chu ambitions in the north for a period.

== Background ==
Following the death of Duke Huan of Qi in 643 BC, the state of Chu steadily extended its influence northward, absorbing half a dozen smaller states as its satellites. In 636 BC, Chong&#x27;er, a ducal prince of Jin, after nineteen years in exile traveling throughout numerous states, came to power as Duke Wen of Jin with the help of Duke Mu of Qin. Duke Wen assumed a position of leadership among the states and instituted numerous domestic reforms.

In the years leading up to 632 BC, conflict between Jin and Chu became increasingly public and was characterized by frequent shifts in alliances between the various small states that lay in a narrow band of land between the two larger states.

King Cheng of Chu attacked the State of Song, the ally of Jin most accessible from the south, in the winter of 633 BCE. In retaliation, an expeditionary force under Duke Wen marched south in the spring of the following year and occupied the States of Wey and Cao, both satellites of Chu. The two sides sought out alliances in the following months. The States of Shen, Xi, Chen and Cai, all immediately contiguous to Chu, sided with King Cheng, as well as the more distant State of Lu.

==Prelude==
As promised by Duke Wen to King Cheng during his exile in Chu, the Jin army retired &quot;three days march&quot; () (45 km) before camping on the plain of Chengpu on the border of Wey and Cao, awaiting a decisive battle. The retirement also linked the Jin forces up with Qi and Qin reinforcements.

Only the central force of the Chu under Prime Minister Ziyu () was made up entirely of Chu troops. The left wing under Zixi incorporated soldiers from Chu&#x27;s close satellites Shen and Xi. The right wing under Zishang comprised completely a separate detachment from the armies of Chen and Cai, perhaps numbering around a third of the entire force.

The Jin force was expanded before the expedition from two armies into three: the upper, the central and the lower; these three were then regrouped into wings before the battle: the upper army at the right wing under commander Hu Mao and vice-commander Hu Yan, lower at left under Luan Zhi and vice Xu Chen, central remained at center under Xian Zhen and vice Xi Zhen. Duke Wen did not direct or engage in the fighting.

==Battle==
On the fourth day of the fourth month of 632 BC, the rival forces met.

The battle commenced with the advance of both wings of the Jin army. The Chu right wing was reckoned to be the weakest and Xu Chen, commander of the Jin left wing, attacked. Xu Chen dressed his chariot horses with tiger skins to panic the Chu horses and launched an urgent, vigorous assault on the Chu right wing. The attack was rapidly successful, scattering and demolishing the enemy wing completely.

The Jin left then became a holding force, fixing the Chu center and preventing it from attacking the Jin centre or aiding the Chu left wing, since in either case the Jin left would have taken it in the flank and rear. Meanwhile, Hu Mao&#x27;s Jin right wing had skirmished with the enemy, faked a retreat and carried with them the two great banners of the Jin commander-in-chief himself. The Chu left, made up of levies from the states of Shen and Xi, thought that the Jin right wing had lost and Ziyue ordered a pursuit. A contingent of chariots under Luan Zhi swept in front and dragged tree branches to raise a dust cloud and thereby obscure the movements of Hu Mao&#x27;s men who were circling and reforming.

The Jin left aided by the Jin center continued to maintain their positions against the Chu center. Though the Jin centre was temporarily disordered by an intense whirlwind, it was effective in preventing the Chu center from supporting its left wing. As the Chu left advanced, it was caught in the flank by Duke Wen&#x27;s bodyguards, composed of the sons of noble clansmen and sons of his close followers, as well as the Song contingent. Meanwhile, the entire force of the Jin right wing completed its re-circling and was supported on its right by Luan Zhi&#x27;s chariots to join the assault. The Chu left was completely destroyed. Seeing both his wings enveloped, Ziyu ordered a general retreat, which turned into rout when it was discovered that the Chu camp and train in the rear had been captured during the battle by the Qi and Qin contingents, which had been sent to occupy it via a flanking march.

== Evaluation ==
The Battle of Chengpu was one of the biggest battles of the Spring and Autumn period and the most detailed in the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. Nevertheless, the location of the battle remains obscure: two inconclusive possibilities are the vicinity of Chenliu, Henan and the southwest area of Juancheng County, Shandong. After returning to the north, Duke Wen was recognized by the King of Zhou as first among the feudal lords. A multi-state conference at Jiantu in 631 BC headed by Duke Wen confirmed their support for the Zhou royal family and swore a covenant of alliance. The battle, however, was not effective in the long term in restricting the power of Chu.

<text>Johan Ludwig Mowinckel(22 October 1870 – 30 September 1943) was a Norwegian statesman, shipping magnate and philanthropist. He served as the prime minister of Norway during three separate terms.

==Biography==
Johan Ludwig Mowinckel was born in Bergen, Norway. His parents were Johan Anton Wilhelm Mohr Mowinckel (1843–1918) and Edvardine Magdalene Margrethe Müller (1851–71). His father was a merchant and a member of one of Bergen&#x27;s old merchant families.
He was educated at University of Oslo, graduating in 1889. After graduation, he traveled abroad to Bremen and London to better learn the business of shipping. In 1893 he returned to Bergen and joined the offices of Christian Michelsen. In 1912, he became the founder and principal in the joint-stock shipping company, A/S J. Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi. He was also involved in founding the Norwegian America Line.

==Political career==
Mowinckel entered public service in Bergen where he became Chairman of the local branch of the Liberal Party (&quot;Bergens Venstreforening&quot;) . He was elected to the Bergen City Council in 1899 and subsequently mayor of Bergen 1902-1906 and 1911–1913. In 1906, he became Member of Parliament (&quot;Storting&quot;) for the Liberal party representing Bergen during 1906-1909 and 1913–1918. He became President of the Storting in 1916. He was voted out of office in the 1918 elections.

During the period between World War I and 1935 he remained active in national politics. In 1921 Mowinckel was re-elected to the Storting. He served as Minister of Trade in 1921-1922 and Foreign Minister in 1922–1923. Mowinckel was Norway&#x27;s Prime Minister during three periods in office; 1924–1926, 1928-1931 and 1933–1935. These were all periods dominated by economic and fiscal crisis. In 1930 Mowinckel initiated the Oslo Convention on customs cooperation between Norway, Denmark and the Benelux countries, to prevent higher customs walls.

In 1925 he became a member of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Mowinckel took the initiative during the Oslo Convention (&quot;Oslokonvensjonen&quot;) of 1930 to encourage free trade between the nations of the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union and Nordic countries, anticipating postwar efforts toward the formation of the European Union. He also took an active interest in the League of Nations, serving on the council and becoming president in 1933. In September 1933, Ukrainian public figures appealed to Johan Ludwig Mowinckel as the Head of the Council of the League of Nations with the request to consider the question of the man-made famine in Ukraine (Milena Rudnytska, Oleksander Shulhyn, Ukrainian Public Committee for Saving Ukraine. Also, Margery Corbett Ashby, the head of International Women&#x27;s Alliance, appealed to him. He kept his word - he included the issue of the Holodomor to the 76th session of the Council of the League of Nations in spite of the resistance of the representatives of some European countries. The discussion of the causes and circumstances of the famine in Ukraine lasted for several hours, but the resolution was not adopted. The delegations of France and Great Britain were against it. He explained his decision by the fact that the &quot;lives of millions&quot; dead of starvation did not allow him to remain silent. He was personally acquainted with Norwegian traveler and public figure Fridtjof Nansen, who in 1932-1933 organized the aid to the Ukrainian farmers. On 20 October 1933, M. Danko, the correspondent of Lviv newspaper &quot;Dilo,&quot; wrote that Mowinckel &quot;will remain in the history of the Ukrainian struggles in Europe.&quot; Children from the Ukrainian community of Czech town of Poděbrady (Czechoslovakia) thanked Johan Ludwig Mowinckel for his humanistic position regarding the protection of the starving people in Ukraine. On 16 November 1933, he sent a warm response with the gratitude for the attention. He condemned the menace of Nazi philosophy, and when Germany overran Norway in 1940 he followed the Norwegian Government-in-exile to London.

In 1942, Johan Ludwig Mowinckel came to the United States and was engaged with Nortraship, the state-owned Norwegian shipping company during World War II. He died on 30 September 1943 in New York City.

==Legacy==
Posthumously, a new library building at the University of Bergen was dedicated to Johan Ludvig Mowinckel and had its official opening ceremony, in the presence of King Olav V, on 13 September 1961.


Movinkel spread awareness about the Holodomor in Soviet Ukraine during the early 30’s. Acknowledged in this editorialized poster below.

<text>Joseph Moxon (8 August 1627 – February 1691), hydrographer to Charles II, was an English printer specialising in mathematical books and maps, a maker of globes and mathematical instruments, and mathematical lexicographer. He produced the first English-language dictionary devoted to mathematics, the first detailed instructional manual for printers, and the first English-language how-to books for tradesmen. In November 1678, he became the first tradesman to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Life==
Joseph Moxon was born on 8 August 1627 in Wakefield, Yorkshire. Around 1638, at an age between 9 and 11, he accompanied his father, James Moxon, to Delft and Rotterdam where James was printing English Bibles. It was at this time that Moxon learned the basics of printing.

==Printer==
After the First English Civil War the family returned to London and Moxon and his older brother, James, started a printing business which specialized in the publication of Puritan texts, with the notable exception of &quot;A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing or Colouring of Mapps and Prints&quot; of 1647 which was produced for Thomas Jenner, a seller of maps.

In 1652, Moxon visited Amsterdam and commissioned the engraving of globe-printing plates, and by the end of the year was selling large celestial and terrestrial globes in a new business venture. He specialised in the printing of maps and charts, and in the production of globes, and mathematical instruments made of paper.

Moxon&#x27;s &quot;Mechanick exercises&quot; was published in parts between 1677 and 1684. It was completed in two volumes: the first giving instructions on metalworking, woodworking, brick-laying and sundial-construction; and the second (issued 1683–1684) providing a detailed series of instructions for printers, including typefounding, composition, press-work etc., which have given printing historians much (probably idealised) information on the working practices of hand-press period printing-houses.

==Hydrographer==
In January 1662, he was appointed hydrographer to the King, despite his Puritan background. His shop at this time was on Ludgate Hill; afterwards, in 1683, it was &quot;on the west side of Fleet Ditch&quot;, but always &quot;at the sign of Atlas&quot;. 

Moxon theorized that the Arctic was ice free, and warmed by twenty-four hours of sunlight in the summer. He also speculated that Arctic ice was created near land, and that if one sailed far enough northwards, one would be free of northern land masses and, subsequently, ice.

These views led him to believe that the Northwest Passage would be found by sailing near the North Pole. These views later influenced Daines Barrington and Samuel Engel, whose refinement of Moxon&#x27;s ideas would influence Captain Cook&#x27;s Third Voyage in search of the Northwest Passage.

==Death==
When Moxon died in 1691 his estate and business was carried on by his son, mapmaker, engraver and instrument-maker James Moxon.

<doc id="842109" wikidata="Q651059" url="?curid=842109" title="Felix Andries Vening Meinesz">
<text>Felix Andries Vening Meinesz (30 July 1887 – 10 August 1966) was a Dutch geophysicist and geodesist. He is known for his invention of a precise method for measuring gravity (gravimetry). Thanks to his invention, it became possible to measure gravity at sea, which led him to the discovery of gravity anomalies above the ocean floor. He later attributed these anomalies to continental drift. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society.

== Biography ==
Vening Meinesz&#x27;s father, Sjoerd Anne Vening Meinesz, was mayor, first of Rotterdam, then of Amsterdam. Felix was born in The Hague and grew up in a protected environment. In 1910 he graduated in civil engineering in Delft. The same year he started working for the Dutch gravity survey. In 1915 he wrote his dissertation on the defects of the gravimeters used at that time.

Vening Meinesz then designed a new gravimeter, which the KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) built. The apparatus has two pendula of the same size hanging in a frame but moving in opposite phases. With mirrors and lightbeams the difference in amplitude of the two pendula is captured on a film. Vening Meinesz had discovered that horizontal accelerations (as by waves on a boat) had no influence on the difference in amplitude between the two pendula. The recorded difference then is the amplitude of a theoretical, undisturbed pendulum. Now it became possible to measure gravity more accurately. Vening Meinesz started with measuring gravity all over the Netherlands, for which a network of 51 monitoring stations was created. This became a success, which encouraged him to do measurements at sea. A perfected gravimeter, hanging in a &quot;swing&quot;, was designed. The experiment was successful.

Now measuring gravity at sea had become possible. Between 1923 and 1929, the tall (over 2 metres) Vening Meinesz embarked in small submarines for some uncomfortable expeditions. His goal was to establish the exact shape of the geoid and the Earth. When his expedition with the submarine HNLMS K XVIII was made into a movie in 1935, Vening Meinesz became a hero of the Dutch cinema public. Besides, his research was in the international scientific spotlight. In 1927 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1927 he became a part-time professor in geodesy, cartography and geophysics at Utrecht University, and in 1937 he became professor at the Delft University of Technology as well. He was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1936, and several other major geology prizes in later years.

In World War II, Vening Meinesz was involved in the Dutch resistance. After the war he could take up his tasks as a professor again. From 1945 to 1951 he was the director of the KNMI. From 1948 to 1951, Vening Meinesz was President of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. He retired in 1957, and died in Amersfoort in 1966.

==Research and discoveries==
The vast amounts of data that his expeditions yielded were analyzed and discussed together with other leading Dutch Earth scientists of the time, J.H.F. Umbgrove, B.G. Escher and Ph.H. Kuenen. The results were published in 1948. An important result was the discovery of elongated belts of negative gravity anomalies along the oceanic trenches, along with a large circular anomaly that became known as the Indian Ocean Geoid Low. The mean gravity force appeared to be the same on land and at sea, which was in agreement with the principle of isostasy. Vening Meinesz was especially intrigued by the oceanic trenches. The coexistence of active volcanism, large negative gravity anomalies and the sudden difference in terrain elevation could only be explained by assuming the Earth&#x27;s crust was somehow pushed together at these places. As a geophysicist, he was prejudiced that the crust was too rigid to deform at that scale in such a way. His discoveries could be explained only with the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1950s.

==Submarine expeditions==
Vening Meinesz measured the gravity field of the Earth with his pendulum apparatus on board several submarines. The following expeditions are described in his publications, &quot;Gravity Expeditions at Sea&quot;:

Vol 1: 1923–1930
* HNLMS K II (1923)
* HNLMS K XI (1925)
* HNLMS K XIII (1926–1927)

* HNLMS O 16 (1937)
* HNLMS O 12 (1937)
* HNLMS O 13 (1938)
* HNLMS O 19 (1939)

Vening Meinesz was not on board during expeditions after 1939. His experiments were performed by his students.
Vol V: 1948–1958
* HNLMS O 24 (1948–1949)
* HNLMS Tijgerhaai (1951)
* HNLMS Walrus (1957)
* HNLMS Vos (1955)
* HNLMS Zeeleeuw (1956)
* HNLMS Fret (1957)

== Legacy ==
Named after him are:
* a gravimeter, an apparatus to measure gravity
* a mathematical function used in geodesy
* a medal of the European Geophysical Society/European Geosciences Union

<text>NonStop is a series of server computers introduced to market in 1976 by Tandem Computers Inc., beginning with the NonStop product line. It was followed by the Tandem Integrity NonStop line of lock-step fault-tolerant computers, now defunct (not to be confused with the later and much different Hewlett-Packard Integrity product line extension). The original NonStop product line is currently offered by Hewlett Packard Enterprise since Hewlett-Packard Company&#x27;s split in 2015. Because NonStop systems are based on an integrated hardware/software stack, Tandem and later HPE also developed the NonStop OS operating system for them.

NonStop systems are, to an extent, self-healing. To circumvent single points of failure, they are equipped with almost all redundant components. When a mainline component fails, the system automatically falls back to the backup.

These systems can be used by banks, stock exchanges, payment applications, retail companies, energy and utility services, healthcare organizations, manufacturers, telecommunication providers, transportation, and other enterprises requiring extremely high uptime.

==History==
Originally introduced in 1976 by Tandem Computers Inc., the line was later owned by Compaq (from 1997), Hewlett-Packard Company (from 2003) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (since 2015). In 2005, the HP Integrity &quot;NonStop i&quot; (or TNS/E) servers, based on Intel Itanium microprocessors, was introduced. In 2014, the first &quot;NonStop X&quot; (or TNS/X) systems, based on Intel x86-64 processors, were introduced. Sales of the Itanium-based systems ended in July 2020.

Early NonStop applications had to be specifically coded for fault tolerance. That requirement was removed in 1983 with the introduction of the Transaction Monitoring Facility (TMF), along with Pathway transaction management software and SCOBOL applications (or, later, NonStop Tuxedo transaction management software), which handles the various aspects of fault tolerance on the system level.

==Software==
NonStop OS is a message-based operating system designed for fault tolerance. It works with process pairs and ensures that backup processes on redundant CPUs take over in case of a process or CPU failure. Data integrity is maintained during those takeovers; no transactions or data are lost or corrupted.

The operating system as a whole is branded NonStop OS and includes the Guardian layer, which is a low-level component of the operating system and the Open System Services (OSS) personality which runs atop this layer, which implements a Unix-like interface for other components of the OS to use.

The operating system and application are both designed to support the fault tolerant hardware. The operating system continually monitors the status of all components, switching control as necessary to maintain operations. There are also features designed into the software that allow programs to be written as continuously available programs. That is accomplished using a pair of processes where one process performs all the primary processing and the other serves as a &quot;hot backup&quot;, receiving updates to data whenever the primary reaches a critical point in processing. Should the primary stop, the backup steps in to resume execution using the current transaction.

The systems support relational database management systems like NonStop SQL and hierarchical databases such as Enscribe.

Languages supported include Java, C, C++, COBOL, SCOBOL (Screen COBOL), Transaction Application Language (TAL), etc. It uses the scripting and job control language TACL (Tandem Advanced Command Language), and is written in TAL and C.

==Hardware==

The HPE Integrity NonStop computers are a line of fault-tolerant, message-based server computers based on the Intel Xeon processor platform, and optimized for transaction processing. Average availability levels of 99.999% have been observed. NonStop systems feature a massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture and provide linear scalability. Each CPU runs its own copy of the OS, and systems can be expanded up to over 4000 CPUs. This is a shared-nothing architecture — a &quot;share nothing&quot; arrangement also known as loosely coupled multiprocessing.

Due to the integrated hardware/software stack and a single system image for even the largest configurations, system management requirements for NonStop systems are rather low. In most deployments there is just a single production server, not a complex server farm.

Most customers also have a backup server in a remote location for IT disaster recovery. There are standard products to keep the data of the production and the backup server in sync, for example, HPE&#x27;s Remote Database Facility (RDF), hence there is fast takeover and little to no data loss also in a disaster situation with the production server being disabled or destroyed.

HP also developed a data warehouse and business intelligence server line, HP Neoview, based on the NonStop line. It acted as a database server, providing NonStop OS and NonStop SQL, but lacked the transaction processing functionality of the original NonStop systems. The line was retired, and no longer marketed, as of 24 January 2011.

<doc id="842117" wikidata="Q600703" url="?curid=842117" title="Communist Party of Sri Lanka">
<text>The Communist Party of Sri Lanka (; ) is a communist party in Sri Lanka. In the 2004 legislative election, the party was part of the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance that won 45.6% of the popular vote and 105 out of 225 seats.

== History ==
The CPSL was founded as the Communist Party of Ceylon in 1943 and was a continuation of the United Socialist Party. The USP had been formed out of the Marxist–Leninist wing of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. The USP was proscribed by the colonial authorities.

The USP and then the CPC was initially led by Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe.

In 1952 Wickremesinghe&#x27;s wife, the English-born Doreen Young Wickremasinghe, a former leader of the Suriya-Mal Movement, was elected to the Sri Lankan parliament.

In 1963 the Communist Party, Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna formed the United Left Front (1963). The ULF broke down in 1964 when the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike offered ministerial posts to LSSP and the CP.

In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 1900.

In 1968, the CP joined the LSSP and the SLFP in the United Front. In the 1970 government, Pieter Keuneman became Minister of Housing and Construction and B. Y. Tudawe, Deputy Minister of Education. However, one faction of the party, led by S. A. Wickremasinghe and Indika Gunawardena, maintained a line of critical support for the government.

After the general election of 1977, for the first time in half a century, the CPSL found itself without parliamentary representation, receiving about 2% of the vote. However, after a subsequent election petition, Sarath Muttetuwegama was elected to the Kalawana seat in a by-election.

Later CPSL joined the People&#x27;s Alliance, the front led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. When SLFP shelved the PA and formed the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance together with Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ahead of the 2004 elections, CPSL and LSSP initially stayed out. They did, however, sign a memorandum with the UPFA at a later stage and contested the elections on the UPFA platform. CPSL does not, however, consider itself a member of UPFA.

The CPSL had one member of parliament in 2004, party general secretary D.E.W. Gunasekara. Gunasekara contested the Sri Lankan parliament speaker election but lost by a handful of votes. Gunasekara was then sworn in as the Minister for Constitutional Affairs.

During the 2020 Parliamentary elections, the CPSL put forward two candidates, Mahesh Almedia in Colombo and Weerasumana Weerasinghe in Matara, under the SLPP&#x27;s Pohottuwa symbol. Dr G. Weerasinghe was nominated for the party&#x27;s National List. Weerasumana was the only candidate to successfully enter Parliament with 77,968 preferential votes.

Gunasekera stepped down as General Secretary of the CPSL on 30 August 2020. Dr G. Weerasinghe was unanimously elected as the new General Secretary by the Central Committee.

==Party organization==
The youth wing of CPSL is the Communist Youth Federation. CYF is a member organization of 
the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

==Allegations==

The CPSL and other Leftist parties were framed by the J R Jayawardane government for instigating 1983 Black July pogroms against the Tamil people. The party was banned and leaders including D.E.W. Gunasekera were imprisoned for over a year. The ban was lifted due to the lack of evidence for the charges and intervention from the Soviet embassy. The ban on the JVP and NSSP stayed the same.

==Publications==
&quot;Aththa&quot; (Truth) is the CPSL&#x27;s flagship Sinhala newspaper, which was renowned for its high standard of journalism, progressive editorials and Sinhala prose.

The English organ of the CPSL was the &quot;Forward&quot; weekly.

<text>Oribi Gorge is a canyon in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 35 kilometres north-west of Port Shepstone, which itself is 120 km south of Durban. Oribi Gorge, cut by the Mzimkulwana River, is the eastern gorge of two gorges that cut through the Oribi Flats (flat sugarcane farmlands) of KwaZulu-Natal. The western gorge was formed by the Mzimkulu River. The gorge is approximately deep, and almost wide at its widest.
Erosion by these rivers have carved out nearly of spectacular kloofs and crags, covered with subtropical vegetation. In the gorge, the dense forest on the sandstone slopes is home to various small mammals, while the large leguaans excavate their burrows along the riverbanks.

At the base of the cliffs of both gorges the basement rocks are part of the Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Province, which is over 1000 million years old. The cliffs themselves are formed by Msikaba formation sandstones deposited by fluvial environment about 365 million years ago. Downstream from the gorges, is a large surface mine producing cement from a limestone deposit. The road through Oribi Gorge was built by Italian prisoners of war.

Oribi Gorge derives its name from the &quot;oribi&quot;, a small antelope that lives in the gorges.

== Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve ==

Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve is a park located along the bottom of the Oribi Gorge at the confluence of the Mzimkulu River and Mximkulwana River, being approximately long, and wide at its widest point. It was proclaimed a protected state forest in 1950.

== Animals ==
In addition to the oribi and monitor lizards, vertebrates include bushbuck, duiker, reedbuck, vervet monkeys, Samango monkeys, various frogs and turtles.

<doc id="842122" wikidata="Q4536469" url="?curid=842122" title="Transaction Language 1">
<text>Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used management protocol in telecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is widely used to manage optical (SONET) and broadband access infrastructure in North America. TL1 is used in the input and output messages that pass between Operations Support Systems (OSSs) and Network Elements (NEs). Operations domains such as surveillance, memory administration, and access and testing define and use TL1 messages to accomplish specific functions between the OS and the NE. TL1 is defined in Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) Generic Requirements document GR-831-CORE.

== History ==
TL1 was developed by Bellcore in 1984 as a standard man-machine language to manage network elements for the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). It is based on Z.300 series man machine language standards. TL1 was designed as a standard protocol readable by machines as well as humans to replace the diverse ASCII based protocols used by different Network Element (NE) vendors. It is extensible to incorporate vendor specific commands.

Telcordia OSSs such as NMA (Network Monitoring and Analysis) used TL1 as the element management (EMS) protocol. This drove network element vendors to implement TL1 in their devices.

== Language overview ==

=== TL1 Messages ===
The TL1 language consists of a set of messages. There are 4 kinds of messages:
# &quot;Input message&quot; - This is the command sent by the user or the OSS.
# &quot;Output/Response message&quot; - This is reply sent by the NE(Network Element) in response to an input message.
# &quot;Acknowledgment message&quot; - This is an acknowledgment of the receipt of a TL1 input message and is sent if the response message will be delayed by more than 2 seconds.
# &quot;Autonomous message&quot; - These are asynchronous messages (usually events or alarms) sent by the NE.

=== TL1 message structure ===
TL1 messages follow a fixed structure, and all commands must conform to it. However, the commands themselves are extensible and new commands can be added by NE vendors.

These are some of the message components:
* Target identifier (TID) &amp; Source identifier (SID) - TID/SID is a unique name assigned to each NE. TID is used to route the message to an NE, SID is used to identify the source of an autonomous message.
* Access identifier (AID) - AID identifies an entity within an NE.
* Correlation tag (CTAG) &amp; Autonomous correlation tag (ATAG) - CTAG/ATAG are numbers used to correlate messages.

An NE address consists of two types of parameters, routing and access. The maintenance functions can be grouped into the following six categories:

* Alarm Surveillance (AS) − Messages of events or conditions (e.g., carrier group alarms, threshold violations).
* Performance Monitoring (PM) − Generated performance data (e.g., number of errored seconds, number of slips).
* Failure Identification (FI) − Mechanisms within the NE to detect and isolate equipment and facility troubles.
* Recovery and Control (RC) − Maintenance purposes. This includes Maintenance State Control, Loopbacks, External Device Control, Initialization, Emergency Reconfiguration, and Process Inhibit and Termination.
* Maintenance Measurement (MM) − to be used for overall assessment of the NE maintenance process.
* Memory Backup (MB) − To/from non-volatile memory within the NE.

GR-833 provides detailed descriptions of commands and responses in the TL1 format.

<text>Tadworth is a large suburban village in Surrey, England in the south-east of the Epsom Downs, part of the North Downs. It forms part of the Borough of Reigate and Banstead. At the 2011 census, Tadworth (and Walton-on-the-Hill) had a population of 7,123

==History==

===Neolithic and Roman period in Britain===
On a small farm to the north-west, South Tadworth Farm, directly at the top of the westward-facing Langley Vale and south of the Epsom Downs Racecourse, is an Iron Age &quot;Banjo enclosure&quot;, a term used by archaeologists for a distinctive type of prehistoric settlement. They were mostly constructed and used during the Middle Iron Age (400–100 BC), although some remained in use up to the time of the Roman Conquest (43 AD).

There are three more rectangular enclosures, which may be mentioned here as being connected in all probability with the settlement of which this villa was part, though they are actually over the border of Banstead parish. Two of these are south of the two windmills south of Tadworth. They are well-marked, nearly square enclosures, with a mound and ditch and gateways to the east or southeast. They are east of the road from Betchworth to Banstead. 

The third is west of the road, and very close to Walton village; but though on land known commonly as Walton Heath, is actually on the Banstead side of the boundary. It is larger than the others, less well-preserved, and with a gateway to the north-west. Roman tiles may be found in or near all three. These enclosures have been commonly referred to as the &#x27;Roman Camps&#x27; on Walton Heath, but it is not obvious that they were camps.

===Dark and Middle Ages===
Tadworth appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Tadeorde&quot; and &quot;Tadorne&quot;. It was held partly by Halsart from William de Braiose and partly by Radulf (Ralph) from the Bishop of Bayeux. Its domesday assets were: 2 hides. It had 5 ploughs, woodland worth 4 hogs. It rendered £3 15s 0d. Manorialism operated for the ensuing centuries.

During this period the listed mills were erected in the south.

====North Tadworth Manor====
In 1273 John and James, sons of William Haunsard lord of North Tadworth Manor, gave a carucate of land, 2 acres of pasture, 12 acres of wood, and 20s. rent in North Tadworth and Little Bookham to the Priory of St Mary Overy — they held until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
However, in 1524 they gave it with the rectory of Banstead to William Coltson and Richard Moys and Elizabeth his wife for a term of forty years, which was widened to complete ownership in effect by Henry VIII. From the Crown to Thomas Walson and Robert Moys, eventually the manor was given up to the latter entirely and stayed in his family until his grandson Henry who held court in 1648. At Henry Moys&#x27; death the manor passed to his five sisters and co-heirs. In 1659 of the owners finally released their income and rights to Christopher Buckle of Burgh (Burgh Heath, see Domesday section for example in Kingswood). Only in 1663 did he acquire the remaining fifth. Since that time North Tadworth has been held as part of the manor of Burgh in Banstead parish.

====South Tadworth Manor====
No Charter, Assize Roll, Patent Roll or other manuscript has been found to explain how the Merton Priory came by the manor of South Tadworth, in Domesday &quot;Tadeorde&quot;, but the priory gained it around the same time when the priory gained Banstead Manor; for they held it in 1291. As with the other manor, this manor was held by a priory until Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries. Henry VIII wanted this land as his own so attached it to the wide, not all joined up, honour of Hampton Court. In 1553 Edward VI granted it in fee to Edward Harendon, also seen as Herrenden, whose children relinquished it from one to the other by fine. 

In 1631–32 Thomas Grymes acquired it leaving it to his son who became Sir George Grymes; in the English Civil War Robert Wilson acquired and conveyed it to Leonard Wessel [sic] in 1694, who held the manor for ten years during which time he rebuilt in into today&#x27;s Grade I listed Queen Anne building, children&#x27;s home and charity headquarters, Tadworth Court. Later an Act of Parliament enabled a fee tail to be cleared off to sell the manor for lack of descendants of John Fleetwood who earlier acquired it, selling it to William Mabbot. Mabbot died at Tadworth Court in 1764, having devised his property to his wife, Lady Rhoda Delves and daughter Rhoda, who with Edward Beaver sold the Court to Sir Henry Harpur in 1773. Robert Hudson and later his widow held from 1808 to c. 1860 followed by Lord Chief Justice Sir Charles Russell, created later first Baron Russell of Killowen and held from 1900 by C. D. Morton.

====Rectory Manors of Banstead====
These were held by St Mary Overie Priory until the dissolution and at various times included the above two manors and the manor of Southmerfield.

In 1732 Edward Fulham, son and heir of Anne daughter and eventually heir of Robert Wayth, sold his fifth share to Christopher Buckle. After this time the entire rectory descended with the advowson (right to call a vicar), and the Earl of Egmont is the present impropriator of the great tithes with the exception of those in South Tadworth, which apparently passed out of the hands of the owner of the rectory in 1551. Theoretically therefore chancel repair liability can apply to those lay impropriators who acquired the land of the South Tadworth manor of 1551 and of the 1911 Earl of Egmont&#x27;s Banstead Manor in the village of Banstead which he bought in 1847.

===Post Reformation===
During this period South Tadworth manor&#x27;s purchasing Lord of the Manor, Leonard Wessels rebuilt the manor on its site and renamed it Tadworth Court in 1700.

===Post Industrial Revolution===
In 1848, the publisher Samuel Lewis described the place only under Banstead, where the living was a perpetual curacy and &quot;A place of worship for dissenters in Tadworth&quot;; much of the proverbial &quot;Banstead Mutton pasture&quot; was at that time being replaced by tilled fields. The great tithes were commuted for £393, the vicarial lesser tithes for £300, and a rent-charge of £201. 5. 9. was payable to the trustees of Newport Grammar School; the glebe (of Banstead) consisted of 6½ acres.

In 1874 a school board was formed for Banstead, Tadworth, and Kingswood, and in 1875 Tadworth and Kingswood School was opened by the board, now Kingswood Primary School.

Still in 1911 topographer and historian H. E. Malden describes Tadworth in detail but summarises it as &quot;Tadworth is a hamlet on the Reigate road, included now in the ecclesiastical district of Kingswood&quot;. However, by that date there was &quot;a Baptist chapel at Tadworth&quot;.

The British Transport Police&#x27;s training headquarters was located at a site between Tadworth and Walton-on-the-Hill until it was closed in 2010. The Dog Section Training School which shared the site was relocated to Keston at this time, to the same location as the Metropolitan Police Dog Training School.

==Geography==
Neighbouring settlements include Walton-on-the-Hill, Kingswood, Epsom, Burgh Heath, Banstead, Reigate. Tadworth lay within the Copthorne hundred, an administrative division devised by the Saxons and later adopted by the Normans.

There are no watercourses draining the area as the chalk easily absorbs water on the Downs. The Tattenham Corner Branch Line forms a deep, curved cutting running past gardens in the centre of the village as it turns to the racecourse to the north, and arrives from a tunnel immediately south of the Tadworth Roundabout preserving the gently wooded heath there.

The village adjoins in its north-west corner the top of Langley Vale, topped by the Iron Age enclosure in South Tadworth Farm. Epsom Downs Racecourse is home to The Derby and forms a contiguous development with &quot;the Tattenhams&quot;, a ward consisting of: the neighbourhoods of Great Tattenhams in the north by Nork, Banstead; Little Tattenhams and Tattenham Corner, see Tattenham Corner.

===Elevation, geology and soil===
The entire village sits on top of the North Downs and, taken as a whole, slopes very gradually from the north from 180m AOD in the south to 151m AOD at the top of Langley Vale (Downsway Close/Kingswood Road). Tadworth is roughly rectangular and is under a mile broad as it has historically been taken to include Banstead Heath to the south, on which it was placed.

Its geology is that of the North Downs (see Surrey – Geology); as to soil, Chipstead, Banstead and Tadworth have the first free-draining, slightly acid loamy soil that tops the wider downs to Guildford and is found around Dorking; it is seen further along the Hog&#x27;s Back along its northern side as well in Surrey.

==Local government==
Surrey County Council elected every four years, has one representative; Mrs Rebecca Paul (Conservative Party)

Three councillors sit on Reigate and Banstead borough council, who are:
==Landmarks==
===The Children&#x27;s Trust===
The Children&#x27;s Trust, Tadworth a national charity providing special care for severely disabled children and rehabilitation to children with acquired brain injuries. This is housed in Tadworth Court. Tadworth Court is a grand Grade I listed building and was built at the height of Queen Anne style architecture in the very early 18th century — namely here in 1700 for Leonard Wessels, Lord of the Manor of Banstead.

===The Water Tower===
Tower House, Tower Road, Tadworth. This building was constructed in 1898 and provided water from the springs of the Sutton District Water Company in Sutton. This enabled substantial development to take place locally. The tower was decommissioned in the early 20th century in favour of one at Colley Hill. The tower has been a prominent landmark on the edge of the heath and now is a domestic residence.

==Demography==
At the 2001 Census Tadworth had a population of 9,522 in 3,792 households.

== Religious buildings ==
The Church of the Good Shepherd is the local Anglican church, which celebrated its centenary in 2012. It is open daily and has a church hall.

St. John the Evangelist is the local Roman Catholic church for the area. It is a modern church and parish, being built and created in the mid-twentieth century.

== Sport ==
Tadworth has a Non-League football club Banstead Athletic F.C. who play at Merland Rise.

Tadworth Athletic Club is Tadworth&#x27;s local running club with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. Formed in 1981, they train on local roads in the winter and on the Downs in the summer every Tuesday evening. The teams participate in the Surrey Cross-Country League and the Surrey Road Running League. The men&#x27;s team, led by David Williamson, won the Surrey Road League in 2012. Each January, the club organises the Tadworth Ten race that attracts hundreds of runners. It starts and ends at Epsom Downs Racecourse and passes through Tadworth and Walton-on-the-Hill.

Tadworth Cricket Club is situated opposite the Duke&#x27;s Head Pub, on the south-east side of the B2032. It has picturesque grounds surrounded by woodland. The club was founded in 1903, and at that time the club was originally based at a site some 400 yards north of where it is currently situated. It is not known exactly when the club moved to its present site, but it is believed to be before World War I. The &#x27;Green&#x27; was substantially smaller then and lacked a pavilion.

In 1951 the club members built a new pavilion near the present site. The pavilion, along with the whole of the clubs&#x27; records and ground equipment, were destroyed by fire. The new pavilion was opened by Alf Gover (formerly of Surrey CCC and England) during Tadworth Village week in 1993. During the summer months, cricket is played at the ground by members of the Club.

==Culture and community==

=== Shops and services ===
The village has two, or possibly three, small shopping areas. The largest is around the station, approximately in the centre of the Tadworth area. There is another towards the south of the area, nearer to Walton Heath, and a third, known locally as Shelvers Hill, to the north, near to Epsom Downs. The shops in these areas include a butcher&#x27;s shop, fishmonger and game dealer, baker, greengrocer and delicatessen. 

There are also two estate agents, a travel agent, an off licence, a gift shop, several restaurants and two newsagents/general stores. Services include one bank, a post office, a medical centre, a dentist, an optician, tyre specialist and a vet&#x27;s surgery. There are three public houses situated to the south-east of the village centre, along the B2032 Dorking Road, these being the Blue Anchor, the Duke&#x27;s Head and Inn on the Green.

International film actress Betty Stockfeld died in Tadworth on 27 January 1966.

<text>Miruts Yifter (, affectionately known as &quot;Yifter the Shifter&quot;, 15 May 1944 – 22 December 2016) was an Ethiopian long-distance runner and winner of two gold medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics. His date of birth is often given as 15 May 1944, though there is some uncertainty about this. His name is also sometimes spelled as Muruse Yefter.

==Early life==
Born in Zalambessa, Tigray, Ethiopia, Miruts spent the early part of his youth working in different factories and as a carriage driver. His talent as a long-distance runner was noticed when he joined the Ethiopian Air Force.

==Running career==
Miruts was called to the Ethiopian national team for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, but he made his Olympic debut four years later in Munich Olympics where he won a bronze medal in 10,000 metres. However, he arrived too late to compete in the 5,000 metres final.

In the 1973 All-Africa Games he won one gold medal (10,000 m) and one silver (5,000 m). At the 1st African Championships in 1979 he won two gold medals (5,000 and 10,000 metres).

Miruts was unable to participate in the 1976 Summer Olympics because his nation boycotted the event. Four years later in Moscow, Miruts made up for his disappointments by winning gold in both the 10,000 m and 5,000 m events. In the final of the 10,000 m he sprinted into the lead 300 m from the finish and won by ten metres. Five days later, in the 5,000 m final, Miruts was boxed in during the last lap. But with 300 m to go, his Ethiopian teammate, Mohamed Kedir, stepped aside and Miruts again sprinted to victory. Due to his abrupt acceleration when executing his kick towards the finish, Miruts acquired the nickname &quot;Yifter the Shifter.&quot;

At Coamo, Puerto Rico on 6 February 1977, Miruts ran a World Best for the half-marathon of 1:02:57.

At the Moscow Olympics, part of the mystery surrounding Miruts was the question of his age, which was reported to be between 33 and 42. Miruts refused to give a definitive answer, telling reporters:

&quot;Men may steal my chickens; men may steal my sheep. But no man can steal my age.&quot;

The most common versions of his date of birth are 1 January 1938 or 15 May 1944 (see IAAF Profile).

Miruts continued competing into the early 1980s, running on Ethiopia&#x27;s gold medal winning team at the 1982 and 1983 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.

==Death==

Miruts died aged 72 on 22 December 2016 in Toronto, Ontario, where he had lived since 2000. According to family members, he had been suffering from respiratory problems.

He was buried in Addis Ababa, in the Holy Trinity Cathedral cemetery.

<text>Ilog, officially the Municipality of Ilog, is a municipality in the province of Negros Occidental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 59,855 people.

Ilog is from Bacolod.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ilog&quot; (or &quot;Ylog&quot;, Tagalog for &quot;river&quot;) was recommended by a Tagalog guide of the Spaniards because the place was entirely surrounded by the longest river on the whole Negros Island, the Hilabangan River.

== History ==
Founded by the Augustinian friars Gerónimo Marín and Francisco Bustos on May 16, 1584, it was the first capital of the historical military district/province of Negros in the late 18th century. The first inhabitants of Ilog are mostly migrants from Panay island.

==Geography==

===Barangays===
Ilog is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Andulauan
* Balicotoc
* Bocana
* Calubang
* Canlamay
* Consuelo
* Dancalan
* Delicioso
* Galicia
* Manalad
* Pinggot
* Barangay I (Poblacion)
* Barangay II (Poblacion)

==Tourism==
The Kisi-Kisi Festival is celebrated every 25 March. “Kisi-kisi” is a Hiligaynon term for the fast movement of crustaceans such as fish, prawns, crabs and shrimps that is abundant in the municipality. The main attraction of the festival is the Kisi-Kisi streetdancing parade competition among barangays that pays tribute to its rich marine resources. The town fiesta also honors the Señor Santo Niño as their patron saint, that is why, before the dance parade a re-enactment of Sinulog is staged to show how their village was saved from the Moro pirates. Another exciting event to look forward to during the opening day of the Kisi-Kisi Festival is the &quot;eat-all-you-can oysters&quot; (referred by tourists as Ilog Talaba Festival) which is open to all visitors. Freshly steamed oysters are served on a long bamboo table for those who would like to savor the seafood. Kisi-Kisi was started by Councilor Mark G. Vargas to help promote Ilog&#x27;s tourism.

In 2018, Ilog celebrated the annual Kisi-Kisi fiesta from March 20 to 25 showcasing giant oysters including crustacean seafood like fish, crabs, shrimps, and prawns.

On March 23, 2024, the 18th edition of the Talaba Festival featured the famous eat-all-you-can steamed 3,000 kilograms of oysters placed on a half-kilometer-long bamboo table and served free to visitors and residents. Bong Go and Phillip Salvador upon invitation of Mercedes Alvarez and Mayor John Paul Alvarez, also joined the residents in the annual fiesta.

==Climate==

==Demographics==
===Languages===
Hiligaynon is the major language of the town, with differences in tone and accent from the Hiligaynon used in Metro Bacolod. Cebuano is also spoken due to Ilog’s proximity to Negros Oriental. Tagalog and English are widely taught. 

===Religion===
Majority of the people are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church and the Philippine Independent Church.

<doc id="842134" wikidata="Q222463" url="?curid=842134" title="Prahok">
<text>Prahok (; , ) is a salted and fermented fish paste (usually of mudfish) used in Cambodian cuisine as a seasoning or a condiment. It originated as a way of preserving fish during the time of the year when fresh fish was not available in abundant supply. Because of its saltiness and strong flavor, it was used as an addition to many meals in Cambodian cuisine, including soups and sauces.

A Cambodian saying goes, &quot;No &quot;prahok&quot;, no salt,&quot; referring to a dish lacking in flavour, highlighting its essentiality in Cambodian cuisine. 

&quot;Prahok&quot; has a strong and distinct odor reminiscent of Limburger or ripe Camembert, which has earned it the nickname &quot;Cambodian cheese&quot;. &quot;Prahok&quot; is usually eaten as a main course with white rice and vegetables such as yardlong beans, cucumbers, winged beans and a variety of eggplants.

&quot;Prahok&quot; is sometimes distributed as a donation to victims of flood or drought by charities and other organizations.

==Varieties and production==
&quot;Prahok&quot; is made with various fish and methods of fermentation. Fish used include snakeheads (&quot;Channa&quot; spp.) and moonlight gourami (&quot;Trichogaster microlepis&quot;). 

&quot;Prahok&quot; is obtained by crushing or grinding fresh fish after de-scaling, gutting and cleaning them. After the fish is crushed, it is left in the sun for a full day, then salted. The &quot;prahok&quot; is fermented in large clay jars covered with a lid made of woven bamboo strips. The prahok can be eaten after only 20 days of fermentation, but the best quality prahok is left to ferment for up to three years.

== &quot;Prahok&quot; dishes ==

&quot;Prahok&quot; can be prepared and served in several different ways. Below are dishes where prahok is the main component.

===Sautéed &quot;prahok&quot;===
&quot;Prahok chien&quot; ( ) It is usually mixed with meat (usually beef or pork) and chilli peppers. It can also be eaten as a dip, accompanied by vegetables like cucumbers or eggplants, and rice.

===Covered &quot;prahok&quot;===
&quot;Prahok kab&quot; ( ) or &quot;prahok ang&quot; ( ), types of &quot;prahok&quot; that are covered with banana leaves and left to cook under pieces of rock beneath a fire or over the coals.

===Raw &quot;prahok&quot;===
&quot;Prahok chhau&quot; ( ) is a type of &quot;prahok&quot; can be used to make a paste with lemon grass, lime juice, fresh peppers, and eggplant eaten with (usually cooked rare) beef steak. Also, this is the type of &quot;prahok&quot; preferably used as a dipping paste for vegetables and fruits.

== Chemical composition ==
Early fermentation &quot;prahok&quot; contains 334 g/kg of protein, which decreases to 248–249 g/kg after one month due to proteolysis. The predominant amino acids in &quot;prahok&quot; are glutamic acid (1.49–2.93 g/kg), alanine (1.75–2.9 g/kg), valine (1.23–1.83 g/kg), leucine (2.27–3.40 g/kg), and lysine (1.13–3.67 g/kg). Unlike &quot;kapi&quot; and &quot;teuk trey&quot;, &quot;prahok&quot; does not contain a high concentration of aspartic acid. The most common organic acids in &quot;prahok&quot; are acetic acid (2.29–7.24 g/kg), lactic acid (0.39–1.14 g/kg) and succinic acid (0.30–1.26 g/kg).

The early fermentation &quot;prahok&quot; has a high content of crude fat (151 g/kg), which drops significantly (to 1.7–10.7 g/kg) after degutting in later stages. Due to the decomposition of fish bone and other structures by microorganisms during the fermentation &quot;prahok&quot; has a greater content of calcium and phosphorus than the fresh fish used.

<text>Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber (17 January 1739 – 10 December 1810), often styled J.C.D. von Schreber, was a German naturalist.

==Career==
Schreber was appointed professor of&quot; materia medica&quot; at the University of Erlangen in 1769.

In 1774, he began writing a multivolume set of books entitled &quot;Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen&quot;, which focused on the mammals of the world. Many of the animals included were given a scientific name for the first time, following the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus. From 1791 until his death in 1810, he was the president of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1787. In April 1795, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Numerous honors were bestowed on him, including the office of an imperial count palatine.

Schreber also wrote on entomology, notably &quot;Schreberi Novae Species Insectorvm&quot;. His herbarium collection has been preserved in the Botanische Staatssammlung München since 1813.

<doc id="842144" wikidata="Q6857669" url="?curid=842144" title="Military history of the Three Kingdoms">
<text>The military history of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period encompasses roughly a century&#x27;s worth of prolonged warfare and disorder in Chinese history. After the assassination of General-in-chief He Jin in September 189, the administrative structures of the Han government became increasingly irrelevant. By the time of death of Cao Cao, the most successful warlord of North China, in 220, the Han empire was divided between the three rival states of Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu. Due to the ensuing turmoil, the competing powers of the Three Kingdoms era found no shortage of willing recruits for their armies, although press-ganging as well as forcible enlistment of prisoners from defeated armies still occurred. Following four centuries of rule under the Han dynasty, the Three Kingdoms brought about a new era of conflict in China that shifted institutions in favor of a more permanent and selective system of military recruitment. This ultimately included the creation of a hereditary military class as well as increasing reliance on non-Chinese cavalry forces and the end of universal conscription.

==Organization==

===Recruitment and organization===
As the Han dynasty fell into disarray after the Yellow Turban Rebellion, its system of conscription and checks on military leadership broke down, giving local leaders the autonomy to recruit their own personal armies. At the heart of each army was a group of trusted Companions (親近 &quot;qinjin&quot;) consisting of family members, close friends and clansmen hired by whatever means was available to their lord. Cao Cao&#x27;s earliest commanders who formed the nucleus of his army were all clansmen (Cao Xiu, Cao Zhen, Cao Chun). There was no need for conscription as the conflicts of the late Han dynasty created willing recruits who sought protection under a strong army. This type of soldier, characterized by a lack of loyalty to state or nation, primarily concerned with survival, made up the majority of the army outside of the leader&#x27;s close following. Due to the lack of loyalty among common troops, acts of heroism and courage were particularly emphasized among commanders who were expected to lead from the front. A typical example of this type of commander would be Dian Wei, a former local bully noted for his great strength, appetite, and his choice of weaponry, two halberds of immense weight, who served under Cao Cao. In 195, he personally led a group of volunteers clad in double armour (兩鎧 &quot;liang kai&quot;) against Lü Bu&#x27;s forces while his liege made his escape. He was promoted to colonel of the bodyguard unit known as the Tiger Warriors and later met his death against Zhang Xiu in 197. While echoes of Han organization continued through the formal titles of military structure, in effect the wars of the Three Kingdoms were fought between armies of bands led by individuals selected by dint of violence and charisma.

===Training===
Military training programs for the general populace in the inner provinces were mostly discontinued after 30 AD to reduce the risk of rebellion. The total number of professional soldiers in standing armies in the Eastern Han, including all the smaller groups, amounted to approximately 20,000 soldiers. Expeditions and campaigns relied upon tens of thousands of troops from local militia armies and non-Chinese auxiliaries, supplemented by professional and semi-professional troops. The men in the inner provinces of the empire could be called to serve during emergencies or serve in local militias to fight against bandits, but these men received no formal training or regular exercise. On the other hand, men of the frontier provinces were liable for conscription and military service as before. This had a negative impact on the performance of the Han army, as noted by Ying Shao, who remarked that &quot;sending [such] men into battle without training is just throwing them away&quot;. The majority of soldiers recruited during the early stages of the Three Kingdoms period were thus &quot;neither disciplined nor well trained in the use of arms&quot;. Formations and drill still existed, but these were the exceptions rather than the norm, and there is no evidence of troops engaging in a regular training system or large scale exercises. Most commanders favored simple rather than complex formations and maneuvers. An example of a formation and drill that did exist is Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Eight Formation Plan, which included different configurations named after Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Clouds. It is not clear what these designations mean, but the Eight Formation Plan was traditionally a square formation composed of nine divisions in three sections, used extensively by Zhuge Liang during his northern expeditions as well as for military training. The lack of training severely constrained the kind of orders a commander could give for his troops to follow. As a consequence of the limited tactical flexibility at their disposal, the majority of battles were carried out in one of two ways: a head on charge by elite shock troops followed by the loosely organized army of incoherent and disparately trained and equipped soldiers, or ambush and surprise the enemy before they could even respond and cause them to rout.

The training that the privileged elite received was far greater in extent compared to that of the common soldier. For example, Cao Cao&#x27;s son, Cao Pi, started his military education in early childhood. He began training in archery at the age of five, started learning how to ride a horse at the age of six, and could both ride and shoot a target at a hundred paces by the time he was eight. Horse archery was also practiced in Shu Han, which fielded a &quot;Flying Army&quot; of mounted archers.

===Hereditary troops===
In contrast to the military hierarchy of the Han dynasty, leadership of a unit in the Three Kingdoms was functionally hereditary as long as the successor was loyal to his liege and proved militarily competent. When the commander died, a male member of his family inherited control of his troops, and when a soldier died one of his male relatives inherited his position in the unit. By the end of the Three Kingdoms, the term &quot;buqu&quot; (部曲) had come to designate the institution of hereditary military leadership. Both &quot;bu&quot; and &quot;qu&quot;, meaning battalions and companies, were originally units of military organization during the Han. Under Cao Cao, a more systematic form of hereditary soldiery was implemented through &quot;military families&quot; (士家 &quot;shijia&quot;) which later became &quot;hereditary troops&quot; (世兵 &quot;shibing&quot;). As their name implies, able male members born into military families served for life, and when they could no longer serve because of illness or death, their sons or close family members replaced them. Their families lived at the capital and other major centers where they could be used by the government as hostages to ensure the loyalty of their soldiers. They were also forbidden from marrying into non-military families in order to prevent their offspring from exiting the system, thus creating a closed community of military households. Although commoners could still be called up in times of urgent need, the rise of government mandated military communities under Cao Wei and the demobilization of local levies under the Jin dynasty, had by and large, replaced the universal conscription of the Han.

===Tuntian===
Tuntian, often rendered as &quot;[military] agricultural colonies,&quot; were self-sustaining farming communities created for the purpose of providing food for the military. Generally consisting of displaced peoples, refugees, and bandits, tenants of a tuntian were expected to protect themselves in times of emergencies and in return were exempt from corvée labour. Unlike the tuntian system of the Han dynasty, which was generally hands off, the tuntian policy of the Three Kingdoms era was to directly provide them with supplies and material assistance. The policy of tuntian was implemented primarily by Cao Cao, Tao Qian, and Gongsun Zan.

==Equipment==


Armies of the Three Kingdoms era used largely the same equipment as the Han dynasty since it directly follows the end of the Han. There were however some minor differences and developments such as the increasing prevalence of armoured cavalry. In one battle, the warlord Cao Cao boasted that with only ten sets of horse armour he had faced an enemy with three hundred sets. The horse armour may however have just been partial frontal barding. Mounting stirrups were already in use, possibly as early as the Han dynasty, but full riding stirrups would not appear until the 4th century. References to &quot;dark armour&quot; (&quot;xuan kai&quot; or &quot;xuan jia&quot; 玄鎧/玄甲) and &quot;brilliant armour&quot; also began to appear in the 3rd century. This is probably in reference to the association of high quality steel with black ferrous material.

Weapons were largely the same as well, although there was more focus on idiosyncratic weapons wielded by particularly noteworthy individuals. For example, one man named Chen An apparently wielded a great sword over two meters in length and Sun Quan&#x27;s wife had over a hundred female attendants armed with daos. Trends in warfare that had already been underway during the Eastern Han continued to gain momentum. By the end of the Three Kingdoms, the single edged dao, with its thicker and more durable dull side, had overtaken the straight double-edged jian as the primary close combat weapon. The more expensive, lighter, and less durable jian entered the domain of court dancers, officials, and expert warriors. While halberds were still used during the period, long spears and lances (similar to pikes) re-rose in prominence over halberds for infantry and cavalry forces. This was believed to have been the result of the long spear and lances&#x27; simpler construction, the adoption of long spears and lances by heavy cavalry to strike infantrymen, and the adoption of tighter infantry formations with less room for swinging and hooking [of halberds] in response to the greater threat by cavalry. Soldiers in the northeast specialized in long spears. After the Han dynasty, the crossbow gradually faded in importance until it made a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.

References to &quot;great shields&quot; occur in their usage on the front line to protect spearmen and crossbowmen. Shields were also commonly paired with the single edged dao and used among cavalrymen. Descriptions of the Battle of Guandu mention that Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers employed shield cover above their heads each time they moved out into the open due to oppressive arrow fire from Yuan Shao&#x27;s wooden towers.

Although Zhuge Liang is often credited with the invention of the repeating crossbow, this is actually due to a mistranslation confusing it with the multiple bolt crossbow. The source actually says Zhuge invented a multiple bolt crossbow that could shoot ten iron bolts simultaneously, each 20 cm long.

===Dark armour===
A report in 231 AD mentions the capture of 5,000 suits of &quot;dark armour&quot; (&quot;xuan kai&quot; or &quot;xuan jia&quot; 玄鎧/玄甲) and 3,100 crossbows. Dark armour appears in Han texts as well, but only as the attire worn by honor guards at funeral processions. The only known trait about dark armour is that it reflected the sun&#x27;s rays. This probably means dark armour was made of high quality steel, which was often associated with black ferrous material.

===Brilliant armour===
Cao Zhi mentioned three different kinds of armour, two of which were variants of &quot;brilliant&quot; armour:

Brilliant armour was made of decarburized steel, which shines blue-black when polished, giving it its name. Chen Lin described brilliant armour in the following manner:

===Wheel catapult===
Ma Jun, a military engineer serving under Cao Wei, devised a siege weapon which threw large stones using a wheel. This device consisted of a drum wheel attached with a curved knife. When rotated, the stones which hung on the wheel would be cut loose by the knife and launched. It is not clear how well this device worked in practice. Successful tests with roof tiles instead of stones are mentioned, but according to Liang Jieming, this contraption never made it past the testing phase and could not have been possible with the technology available at the time.

===Special weapons===
The historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms attributes a number of fictional weapons, often with special names, to certain individuals. Examples include Liu Bei&#x27;s &quot;Paired Winding Swords&quot; (雙股劍), Guan Yu&#x27;s &quot;Green Dragon Crescent Blade&quot; (青龍偃月刀), Zhang Fei&#x27;s &quot;Eighteen chi Serpent Lance&quot; (丈八蛇矛), Zhao Yun&#x27;s &quot;Blue Steel Sword&quot; (青釭劍), Cao Cao&#x27;s &quot;Sword of Heaven&quot; (倚天劍), Sun Jian&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Ingot Blade&quot; (古錠刀), Cheng Pu&#x27;s &quot;Ironspine Serpent Lance&quot; (鐵脊蛇矛), and Lü Bu&#x27;s &quot;Fangtianhua Ji&quot; (方天畫戟), otherwise known as the &quot;Sky Piercer&quot; or &quot;Sky Piercing Halberd&quot;. While these are completely fictional, the Records of the Three Kingdoms do mention weapons unique to individuals on at least two occasions: Dian Wei&#x27;s double halberd which weighed 20 kg and Gongsun Zan&#x27;s two-bladed spear.

==Single combat==
The Records of the Three Kingdoms and Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms contain two instances of single combat between generals. In 192, after Dong Zhuo had been murdered, Li Jue and Guo Si formed an army to oust Wang Yun and Lü Bu from Chang&#x27;an. When Guo Si approached the city from the north, Lü Bu opened the gate and offered to settle the matter by single combat. Guo Si agreed and engaged with Lü Bu, who pierced Guo Si with his lance. Guo Si&#x27;s men came forth, saving their general, and both sides withdrew. Another instance of individual combat occurred between Taishi Ci, then serving under Liu Yao, and Sun Ce. Taishi Ci was on a mission accompanied by only a single horseman when he met Sun Ce, who had 13 other men with him. Taishi Ci charged at Sun Ce and the two sides clashed in single combat. Sun Ce pierced Taishi&#x27;s horse and managed to grab hold of his halberd while Taishi removed Sun&#x27;s helmet. When their respective reinforcements showed up, they disengaged and the duel came to an end.

Combat between generals and officers during battle is also mentioned by the Records. In 197 Yan Xing, an officer of Han Sui, engaged with Ma Chao and nearly killed him when his spear broke and pierced Ma Chao&#x27;s neck. In 200 Yan Liang, a general of Yuan Shao, was slain by Guan Yu, then serving under Cao Cao, during the Battle of Boma. In 214 Zhang Liao charged Sun Quan&#x27;s army with only 800 men and reportedly killed ten soldiers and two officers. He then broke through the enemy ramparts and challenged Sun Quan to a duel, to which he declined.

==Three Kingdoms==
===Cao Wei===

Cao Wei was founded by Cao Pi in 220 and was usurped by Sima Yan&#x27;s Jin dynasty in 266.

====Cao Cao====

Cao Cao was the son of Cao Song, whose original surname was Xiahou but took the name of Cao as a child when he was adopted by the eunuch Cao Teng. During his childhood Cao Cao studied the &quot;Art of War&quot; and was fond of hawking and hunting with dogs. He was also considered a troublemaker and local thug in his town. At one point in his youth, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao raided a wedding. Cao Cao kidnapped the bride and directed the pursuers toward Yuan Shao. Xu Shao foretold that Cao Cao would be &quot;a good servant in time of peace, a dangerous chieftain in time of trouble&quot;.

In the 170s Cao Cao became a chief of police in Luoyang and made a name for himself as a strict enforcer of the law. He was eventually implicated and dismissed from his post in 178.

Cao Cao took part in suppressing the Yellow Turban rebellion in 184 as a Commandant of Cavalry. He was then appointed Chancellor of Jinan Commandery, where he set about removing officials under the influence of the imperial family. Cao Cao became afraid of the enemies he had made at court so he left his post.

In 188, Cao Cao became a colonel of the Army of the Western Garden. When Dong Zhuo seized power in 189, Cao Cao fled to Chenliu Commandery, where he sold his family estates and raised troops to join Yuan Shao and the Campaign against Dong Zhuo. Irritated by Yuan Shao&#x27;s lack of action, Cao Cao advanced into He&#x27;nan Commandery only to suffer defeat at the Battle of Xingyang.

Cao Cao raised more troops in Yang Province. In 191 he became Administrator of Dong Commandery for defeating the bandit chieftain Bo Rao. When Liu Dai, the Inspector of Yan Province, died in 192 while dealing with the Yellow Turbans from Qing Province, Cao Cao succeeded him. By the end of the year Cao Cao had negotiated the surrender of the rebels, who augmented his army with 30,000 additional soldiers, known collectively as the Qingzhou Troops (青州兵).

In 193 Cao Cao drove away Yuan Shu to the south. At this time however, his father Cao Song and brother Cao De were killed by some of the rogue troops of Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province. Cao Cao invaded Xu Province in retaliation massacring hundreds of thousands of civilians on his first campaign, but in 194 while on his second campaign against Tao Qian his former friend Zhang Miao raised the flag of rebellion in Yan Province. With the aid of Lü Bu, the rebels dealt several defeats to Cao Cao, taking most of the province. Eventually the tide turned on them and Cao Cao regained his territories. Zhang Miao&#x27;s family was destroyed while Lü Bu fled to Xu Province.

In 196 Cao Cao took control of the imperial court and moved it to Xu city. In 197 Cao Cao came into conflict with Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao. However he retreated due to news of a potential raid by Yuan Shao. In 198 Liu Bei took refuge with Cao Cao and requested his aid against Lü Bu. Cao Cao laid siege to Lü Bu in Xiapi Commandery and killed him that winter, taking control of Xu Province. Liu Bei rebelled and was driven away. Yuan Shao crossed the Yellow River with a large army in the spring of 200 but was too slow to mobilize. In the winter Cao Cao led a raiding party behind enemy lines and destroyed their supply train at the Battle of Guandu, causing Yuan Shao&#x27;s army to disintegrate. Meanwhile, Liu Bei had been making trouble in Ru&#x27;nan Commandery with the bandit Gong Du. With Yuan Shao no longer posing a threat, Cao Cao returned to deal with Liu Bei, driving him away to take refuge with Liu Biao.

In the summer of 202, Yuan Shao died, leaving his territory to his sons. They fought among themselves and fell prey to Cao Cao&#x27;s advances. By 205 he had ousted Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang from their southern territories. Over the next two years he brought Ji Province and southern Bing Province under his control. In the summer of 207 Cao Cao made a roundabout trip north and defeated the Wuhuan at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. They fled to Gongsun Kang in Liaodong Commandery, but he beheaded them and delivered their heads to Cao Cao.

As Cao Cao prepared to campaign south in 208, Liu Biao died. His son Liu Zong surrendered while Liu Bei fled further south. Cao Cao followed and defeated Liu Bei at the Battle of Changban. Seizing the naval base at Jiangling, Cao Cao moved his new river fleet downstream. His confrontation with Liu Bei and the Sun Quan&#x27;s general Zhou Yu culminated in defeat and the destruction of his fleet at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Failing to cross the Changjiang, Cao Cao retreated north.

In 211 Cao Cao moved west against Zhang Lu and in doing so also drew the ire of Ma Chao and Han Sui. They were outmaneuvered and defeated at the Battle of Tong Pass. In 212 Cao Cao left Xiahou Yuan behind to continue the northwestern campaign while he returned east to attack Sun Quan across the Huai River. The invasion force reached the banks of the Changjiang but failed to break the enemy defenses. Cao Cao returned to Ye City in 213.

In 215 Cao Cao eliminated Zhang Lu and occupied Hanzhong Commandery. Cao Cao attacked Sun Quan again in 217 after Sun Quan&#x27;s failed attack in 215. However he was never able to make it past the Changjiang defenses but was able to gain Sun Quan&#x27;s nominal surrender. In the spring of 219, his general Xiahou Yuan was killed at the Battle of Mount Dingjun and Cao Cao lost his position in Hanzhong Commandery. Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu also defeated Yu Jin&#x27;s fores in Nanyang Commandery and laid siege to Cao Ren in Fancheng. However he was unable to take the city and was himself killed when Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lü Meng who took advantage of the situation and attacked him from behind. Cao Cao died soon afterward on 15 March, 220. He was succeeded by his son Cao Pi.

Although primarily known as a military leader, Cao Cao also compiled a commentary on the &quot;Art of War&quot; and was a renowned poet and player of the game of weiqi. His two most famous poems, &quot;Though the Tortoise Lives Long&quot; and &quot;Short Song Style&quot; were written during and right before the battles of White Wolf Mountain and Red Cliff.

====Later history====

On 11 December, 220, Cao Pi deposed the last Han emperor and proclaimed himself Emperor of Cao Wei. During his reign Cao Pi alienated his brothers Cao Zhang and Cao Zhi. Cao Pi deeply distrusted his close kin and reduced their powers out of suspicion of their loyalty. Cao Pi died in 226 and was succeeded by his son Cao Rui. Although Cao Rui was twenty years old, he was nonetheless appointed a regency council by his father prior to his death. By 236, three members of the regency council had died, leaving Sima Yi as the primary leader of Cao Wei. Before this time, Shu Han launch attacks on the Wei borders and in 229, Zhuge Liang occupied Wudu Commandery. He was, however, unable to make any further gains during his battles against Sima Yi and died in 234. In 238 Sima Yi annexed the Gongsun state in the northwest. This was followed by a campaign into Goguryeo in 244 and 245. Cao Rui died in 239 and was succeeded by his adopted son Cao Fang, who fell under the regency of Cao Shuang and Sima Yi.

In 249 Sima Yi killed Cao Shuang and seized power in Wei. He died two years later and was succeeded by his son Sima Shi. Cao Fang tried to retake power for himself in 254 but failed and was replaced by his cousin, Cao Mao. Sima Shi died in 255 and was succeeded by his brother Sima Zhao. In 260 Cao Mao, like his cousin, attempted to seize control of the state, but failed and died in the process. In 264 Sima Zhao conquered Shu Han, eliminating one of the Three Kingdoms. He died the following year and was succeeded by his son Sima Yan. On 8 February 266, Sima Yan deposed the last emperor of Wei, Cao Huan, and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Jin dynasty.

Sima Yan went on to annex the southern state of Eastern Wu in 280, putting an end to the period of the Three Kingdoms.

===Shu Han===
Shu Han was founded by Liu Bei in 221 and was conquered by Cao Wei in 263.

====Liu Bei====

Liu Bei was a very distant descendant of Emperor Jing of Han. His father Liu Hong died when he was still very young and his mother made a living by selling straw sandals. In 175 Liu Bei was sent to study at the Taixue of Luoyang, where he became friends with Gongsun Zan. Liu Bei had very little interest in books but had a knack for fighting and inspired many young men to join him. With the support of two merchants, Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang, Liu Bei was able to create a sizable following including his long time friends Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in 184 Liu Bei led his troops against them under various commanders. He did well in both campaigns but was only rewarded with a very low position in the imperial service. He abandoned his post when an officer tried to reduce his position and joined Guanqiu Yi on an expedition against rebels in Danyang Commandery. For his service in that expedition he was rewarded with the post of assistant magistrate in a county in Pingyuan Commandery. When the anti-Dong Zhuo coalition formed, Liu Bei raised troops in their service, but soon afterwards left to join his friend Gongsun Zan in the north.

Liu Bei assisted Gongsun Zan against his rival Yuan Shao in 191 and was given the post of magistrate in Pingyuan Commandery. His post didn&#x27;t last long as Yuan Shao dealt a devastating blow to Gongsun Zan in 192 and Liu Bei was forced to move east to Qi Commandery. When Tao Qian of Xu Province offered him 4,000 troops and a post in Pei Commandery, Liu Bei accepted. Tao Qian died in 194 and Liu Bei succeeded him as Governor of Xu Province. In 196 Yuan Shu invaded from the south and fought Liu Bei for a month at a stalemate. During this time however, Liu Bei had lost Xiapi Commandery due to Zhang Fei killing its Chancellor allowing Lü Bu, who was at the time taking refuge in the province, to attack Liu Bei and forced him to surrender. Having defeated Liu Bei and taken control of Xu Province, Lü Bu drove away Yuan Shu&#x27;s army. Though he was defeated, Liu Bei still retained Pei Commandery. When Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei again, Lü Bu prevented his advance out of fear that Yuan Shu would become too powerful. Liu Bei continued to recruit troops until 198 when he intercepted a trade convoy from Lü Bu. Lü Bu&#x27;s officers Gao Shun and Zhang Liao retaliated, taking Pei Commandery and forcing Liu Bei to flee to Cao Cao. Cao Cao sent an army under Xiahou Dun to assist Liu Bei against Lü Bu. In the autumn their army was defeated by Gao Shun. When Cao Cao joined them in the winter, they successfully laid siege to Lü Bu in Xiapi Commandery and killed him the following year.

In 199 Liu Bei was sent to intercept Yuan Shu from making contact with Yuan Shao. When Liu Bei reached Xu Province, he rebelled, killing the Inspector Che Zhou. Cao Cao&#x27;s initial attempt to suppress him ended in failure but the second one in 200 succeeded. Liu Bei abandoned his family and Guan Yu, who were captured, and fled to Yuan Shao in Qing Province. He was sent to Ru&#x27;nan Commandery to assist the bandit Gong Du but suffered defeat at the hands of Cao Cao&#x27;s officer Cao Ren.He was however able to defeat and kill Cao Cao&#x27;s officer Cai Yang. Yuan Shao&#x27;s army was defeated in 200 at the Battle of Guandu and Liu Bei was forced to take refuge with Liu Biao in Jing Province.

Stationed on the northern frontier of Jing Province, in 202 Liu Bei achieved victory against Xiahou Dun and Yu Jin at the Battle of Bowang. After that Cao Cao became preoccupied with the north while Liu Bei was recalled to court. During his stay with Liu Biao, Liu Bei recruited Zhuge Liang, who would later become the leading military figure of Shu Han. In the autumn of 208 Liu Biao died and Cao Cao moved to invade. Liu Biao&#x27;s son Liu Zong chose to surrender. Liu Bei led his followers south to the Changjiang where they were heavily defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of Changban in Nan Commandery. While Cao Cao occupied the naval base at Jiangling, Liu Bei retreated to the southeast towards Xiakou, and Zhou Yu, general of Sun Quan to the east, came upriver with a sizable army. Having augmented his main army with Jing Province&#x27;s fleet, Cao Cao continued his advance in the winter against Zhou Yu and Liu Bei&#x27;s forces arrayed on the east bank of the Changjiang. Despite his superior numbers, Cao Cao was defeated at the Battle of Red Cliffs and his fleet was destroyed by a deployment of fire ships by Sun Quan&#x27;s officer, Huang Gai. In the winter of 208-209 Liu Bei has conquered most of southern Jing while Zhou Yu had captured Jiangling thus ending any hope Cao Cao had of obtaining area across the Changjiang.

After Liu Qi died in 208, Liu Bei became the Governor of Jing Province. Zhou Yu died in 210 and his successor Lu Su convinced Sun Quan to &quot;lend&quot;(give) Liu Bei Nan Commandery. In 211 Liu Zhang invited Liu Bei to Yi Province as an ally. In 212 Liu Bei betrayed Liu Zhang and attacked him, waging a two-year war that ended in Liu Zhang&#x27;s surrender and Liu Bei&#x27;s conquest of Yi Province. In 215 Sun Quan demanded that Liu Bei give him all of southern Jing Province that Liu Bei had obtained. When Liu Bei denied his demands, Sun Quan sent an invasion force commanded by Lü Meng and Lu Su and Liu Bei sent Guan Yu to confront the two in response while he gathers troops for an inevitable battle. A settlement was eventual reached, dividing southern Jing along the Xiang River. In 217 Liu Bei invaded Hanzhong Commandery, which was then under the control of Cao Cao, and solidified his gains in 219 by achieving a decisive victory over the Cao army and killing Xiahou Yuan.

In the autumn of 219, Liu Bei proclaimed himself King of Hanzhong at a coronation ceremony in Mianyang, and established a court in Chengdu. Liu Bei&#x27;s general, Guan Yu, besieged Fan city, in modern Xiangfan, but Cao Cao&#x27;s cousin Cao Ren held out and Cao Cao&#x27;s officer Xu Huang came to his rescue and drove Guan Yu away from Fan Castle. In the winter while Guan Yu was fighting against Cao Ren an offensive by Lü Meng into Nan Commandery ruined Guan Yu&#x27;s position and he was killed by Lü Meng upon his capture. Sun Quan thus had seized southern Jing Province.

On 15 May 221, Liu Bei proclaimed himself emperor. He then attacked Sun Quan through the Three Gorges and into the middle Changjiang. The following year Lu Xun destroyed Liu Bei&#x27;s line of camps and forced him to retreat to Baidi Castle with heavy losses. Liu Bei fell ill soon after the battle and upon Sun Quan being under attack by the forces of Cao Pi the two reformed their alliance. Liu Bei died in the summer of 223 and was succeeded by his son Liu Shan, though the government was effectively under the control of Zhuge Liang as a part of Liu Bei&#x27;s dying request.

====Liu Shan====
Liu Shan was only 17 years old when his father died and lacked the ability to lead so Zhuge Liang became de facto head of state. In 224 and 225 Zhuge Liang embarked on a Southern Campaign which brought at least nominal submission from chieftains in the south of Yi Province. In the north Zhuge Liang made several attempts to break through the Qinling range, managing to occupy Wudu Commandery in 229. However he was unable to press farther north in his conflicts with Sima Yi and died in 234. Unlike the Sun and Cao regimes, Shu Han never managed to create anything more than an ad hoc warlord regime, probably because its leaders were not native to the region. In 264 Shu Han was conquered by Sima Zhao, the de facto ruler of Cao Wei, whose son Sima Yan would go on to depose the Cao sovereign on 8 February 266, and proclaim himself emperor of the Jin dynasty.

===Eastern Wu===
Eastern Wu, also known as Sun Wu, was founded by Sun Quan in 229 and was conquered by the Jin dynasty in 280.

====Sun Jian====
The twins Sun Jian and Sun Qiang were born in 155 AD to an undistinguished merchant family based in the county of Fuchun, Wu Commandery, Yang province. Although his family was of no great importance, they were purportedly descendants of the military strategist Sun Zi, who is traditionally credited with the authorship of &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Whether the claimed ancestry is true or not, Sun Jian&#x27;s family played little role in the affairs of the Han dynasty, and next to nothing is known about Sun Jian&#x27;s obscure lineage.

As a youth, Sun Jian was described as unusual in appearance, kind, intelligent, but fond of odd behavior. At the young age of 16 he was appointed a junior civil officer in the county administration. Sun Jian first made a name for himself at the age of 17 when he went on a trip with his father to Qiantang. During the trip they heard of a band of pirates led by Hu Yu robbing nearby travelers. Sun Jian wanted to attack them while his father wanted nothing to do with the pirates. Even so, Sun Jian set out to confront the pirates. He climbed onto a hill overlooking their camp and waved his sword as if directing soldiers to attack. The pirates thought Sun Jian was part of a government force so they fled. Sun Jian chased after them and took one head as proof of his success. Thereafter, he was promoted to Commandant.

In 172, Sun Jian was appointed Major of troops in Wu Commandery to put down Xu Chang&#x27;s rebellion in Kuaiji Commandery. Sun Jian&#x27;s success against the rebels drew the attention of Zang Min, who was in overall command of local forces. With Zang Min&#x27;s recommendation, Sun Jian became Assistant in the county of Yandu, Guangling Commandery. For the next ten years he remained an official in Xu Province, where he gained a sizable following, and was well liked by those around him:

When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in 184, Sun Jian was called up by Zhu Jun in Kuaiji Commandery, and appointed Associate Major. None could stand against him. Sun Jian constantly led at the forefront of his troops, being the first to scale the walls of Wancheng, dealing the last great blow to the Yellow Turbans. After the Yellow Turbans&#x27; defeat, Sun Jian was transferred over to the west to deal with the Liang Province rebellion. During his time there, he came to butt heads with Dong Zhuo, who felt that Sun Jian was a good commander but lacked quality troops.

In 186, Sun Jian returned to the capital and in 187 was promoted to Grand Administrator of Changsha Commandery. As Grand Administrator, Sun Jian destroyed the local rebels Ou Xing, Zhou Chao, and Guo Shi, even aiding neighboring commanderies, much to the consternation of his clerical officers:

For his service in defeating the rebels, Sun Jian was enfeoffed as Marquis of Wucheng, the highest noble rank attainable for a man outside of the imperial family.

When Dong Zhuo seized power at Luoyang in 189, Sun Jian joined Yuan Shu and the anti-Dong Zhuo coalition. When Sun Jian passed by Jing Province, he killed its Inspector Wang Rui as well as the Administrator of Nanyang Commandery, Zhang Zhi, and took over their troops. Sun Jian took the lead in the allied offensive but was defeated by Xu Rong in 191. After recovering from his losses, Sun Jian defeated Hu Zhen and captured the capital of Luoyang. Defending the devastated city however was unfeasible, so he retreated with the Imperial Seal in tow, and passed it down to Yuan Shu. While Sun Jian was attacking Luoyang, the alliance had already broken up, and Yuan Shao&#x27;s general Zhou Yu (Renming) attacked his base camp. Sun Jian returned and drove back Zhou Yu&#x27;s army. Yuan Shu then sent him against Liu Biao in Jing Province, where Sun Jian died at the age of 37 in a skirmish near Xiangyang.

====Sun Ce====
Sun Ce, son of Sun Jian, was 16 years old when his father died. His cousin, Sun Ben, whose father Sun Qiang had died in 175, took over his personal following and served under Yuan Shu. When Yuan Shu was driven to Jiujiang Commandery in 193, Sun Ce was given commission and sent south with some of his father&#x27;s former troops. Sun Ce was defeated by Zu Lang and returned north the following year. He was granted another thousand troops and sent to take Lujiang Commandery from Lu Kang. Although successful in his endeavor, he was not promoted as was promised by Yuan Shu. In 195 he was sent against Liu Yao in Yang Province. Sun Ce quickly took over the region and pushed Liu Yao to Yuzhang Commandery. By 197 when Yuan Shao declared himself emperor, Sun Ce had become the dominant power in Yang Province, so he rejected his former allegiance and allied himself to Cao Cao. In 198 Sun Ce invaded Lujiang Commandery and defeated Liu Xun and Huang Zu. In 200 the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery surrendered. At this point Yan Baihu and Xu Gong rebelled, so Sun Ce returned east, killing Xu Gong. Before he could deal with Yan Baihu however, Sun Ce was ambushed and killed by Xu Gong&#x27;s retainers. He was 26 at the time of death.

====Sun Quan====


Sun Quan succeeded his elder brother and spent the next two years studying. In 203 Sun Quan attacked and destroyed Huang Zu&#x27;s fleet. In 204 he dealt with a rebellion in Danyang Commandery which killed his brother Sun Yi. In 205 his officer He Qi began expanding into modern Fujian and by 208 a full commandery had been created in the area. The attack on Huang Zu renewed in 207 and Sun Quan&#x27;s forces successfully defeated and killed him in 208 at the Battle of Jiangxia.

Liu Biao died that year and his son Liu Zong surrendered to Cao Cao. As Liu Bei and Liu Qi fled south, Cao Cao requested Sun Quan&#x27;s support, but Sun Quan decided to resist the northern encroachment instead and sent his generals Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu to support Liu Bei&#x27;s cohort. Despite Cao Cao&#x27;s overwhelming numerical superiority, his forces failed to cross the Changjiang and were defeated at the Battle of Red Cliff by an attack of fire ships from Sun Quan&#x27;s officer Huang Gai. Cao Ren managed to hold onto Jiangling for another year before retreating north.

Liu Qi died soon afterwards and Jing Province was split between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. While Sun Quan&#x27;s forces were preparing to launch an invasion of Yi Province ruled by Liu Zhang, his general Zhou Yu fell ill and died in 209. Zhou Yu&#x27;s successor Lu Su convinced Sun Quan to let Liu Bei &quot;borrow&quot; Nan Commandery in order to stabilize the situation on the western frontier. Meanwhile, Sun Quan established his capital at Jianye, in modern Nanjing. Sun Quan&#x27;s attempts to capture territory north of the Changjiang ended in failure both in 208 and in 215. However, when he demanded the &quot;return&quot; of Nan Commandery from Liu Bei in 215, and was denied, Sun Quan moved west and occupied the commanderies of Jiangxia, Changsha, and Guiyang.

In 217 Cao Cao made a major attack on the south. Despite failing to achieve any real gains, Cao Cao stationed a substantial army in the area, threatening Sun Quan&#x27;s territory forcing Sun Quan to act as a figurative subordinate to Cao Cao. In 219 Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lü Meng attacked Guan Yu&#x27;s position in Jing Province on advice from Sima Yi during Guan Yu&#x27;s attack on Fan Castle. Guan Yu was caught off guard and killed while the southern province fell under Sun Quan&#x27;s control. Liu Bei retaliated in 221 but failed to make any headway and the invasion was defeated by Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun. In 226 Sun Quan launched attacks towards the south and annexed Jiaozhou. In 229, Sun Quan declared himself emperor of Eastern Wu, creating the last of the Three Kingdoms.

For the next 20 years, Sun Quan conducted several military campaigns in the north as well as an expedition to Yizhou in 230, but nothing ever came of these ventures. Noted for his longevity, Sun Quan was nevertheless unsuccessful as a military commander in comparison to his peers Liu Bei and Cao Cao. He died in 252 and was succeeded by his son Sun Liang.

====Demise====
After the death of Sun Quan, the dynasty became paralyzed by infighting. Sun Liang assassinated his guardian Zhuge Ke under the influence of a distant relative Sun Jun. When Sun Jun died in 256, he was succeeded by his cousin Sun Lin. In 258 Sun Liang sought to rid himself of his overseers but failed and was dethroned. He was replaced by Sun Xiu, sixth son of Sun Quan, then 22 years old. Sun Xiu staged a coup against Sun Lin and seized power for himself. Sun Xiu died in 264 and was succeeded by Sun Hao. However, by this time he could do little to stop the might of the Jin dynasty, which had just recently conquered Shu Han. Eastern Wu would itself be conquered in 280.

==Major warlords==


===Dong Zhuo, Li Jue, and Guo Si===
Dong Zhuo and his brother Dong Min were born to Dong Junya (hailing from Lintao, Longxi Commandery) in Yingchuan Commandery. As a youth, Dong Zhuo was reputed to possess immense strength and to carry two bows at each side. In 165 he became a major under Zhang Huan. For his service in defeating Qiang rebels, Dong Zhuo was promoted through the imperial ranks until he became Administrator of Hedong Commandery in the early 180s. In the summer of 184, Dong Zhuo was dispatched to take over overall operations against the Yellow Turban Rebellion, however he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and dismissed in the autumn. Dong Zhuo was then dispatched as a subordinate general under Zhang Wen against the Liang Province rebellion. In late 185, Dong Zhuo and Bao Hong defeated the Liang rebels at Meiyang in Youfufeng Commandery. However, when they gave chase to the rebel forces, they were surrounded and forced to fight their way out. Dong Zhuo disguised his army as fishermen to escape the enemy forces. When they passed by, Dong Zhuo had his men destroy the river dam, blocking the enemy&#x27;s path, and securing their retreat. Dong Zhuo refused to obey a summons from Zhang Wen, whose staff officer Sun Jian recommended he execute Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo later served in the imperial army against another group of rebel forces laying siege to Chencang in Youfufeng Commandery. The commanding general Huangfu Song defeated the rebels without heeding any of the advice Dong Zhuo gave him. It was said that Dong Zhuo was arrogant and insubordinate.

In 189, Emperor Ling of Han died. General-in-Chief He Jin called on Dong Zhuo to support his elimination of the eunuchs from power. However, by the time he reached Luoyang, He Jin had already been killed by the eunuchs, who were in turn killed by the guards. On 25 September, 189, Dong Zhuo took possession of the emperor Liu Bian and his brother Liu Xie, establishing his puppet regime in Luoyang. On 28 September he forced Liu Bian to abdicate in favor of his brother Liu Xie. Then he killed Liu Bian a few days later. In the spring of 190 the governors in the east formed a coalition and led a Campaign against Dong Zhuo. Pressured by the enemy alliance, Dong Zhuo moved the court west to Chang&#x27;an in the summer after plundering Luoyang. In the spring of 191 Luoyang was captured by Yuan Shu&#x27;s general Sun Jian. On 22 May, 192, Dong Zhuo was killed by Wang Yun and Lü Bu, who were soon overthrown by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s former officers, Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou.

In 194 there was a brief war with Ma Teng and Han Sui who were defeated by Guo Si and Fan Chou. In 195 Li Jue killed Fan Chou and took over his troops. Guo Si turned on Li Jue and infighting between them went on for months until a ceasefire was called. In the confusion of the conflict, the emperor was able to escape Chang&#x27;an and fled east with the help of several supporters. The emperor reached Luoyang in 196 and was then taken to Yingchuan Commandery by Cao Cao. In 197 Guo Si was killed by his officer Wu Xi. In 198 a local warlord Duan Wei killed Li Jue.

===Gongsun Du, Kang, Gong, and Yuan===
Gongsun Du was born in Xiangping (Liaoyang, Liaoning). In his early years, Du&#x27;s father fled to Xuantu Commandery, where Du became an office runner. Du attracted the support of the governor Gongsun Yu, whose daughter he eventually married. He rose up the ranks of officialdom in Ji Province until he became regional inspector.

Gongsun Du was appointed Administrator of Liaodong Commandery by Dong Zhuo in 189 on the recommendation of Xu Rong. As a result of his lowly origins, Du harbored an intense hatred for the elite landowning class. Once he became administrator, Du carried out his vendetta against the wealthy by publicly flogging to death the Magistrate of Xiangping and extirpating the gentry. Du dominated the northeast and expanded into the territory of Goguryeo and the Wuhuan. When Cao Cao attempted to bestow titles upon Du, he rejected them and proclaimed himself king. Du died in 204 and was succeeded by his son, Gongsun Kang. In 204 Kang expanded into Goguryeo and created Daifang Commandery. When the Wuhuan were defeated by Cao Cao in 207, Yuan Shang, Yuan Xi, and the Wuhuan leaders Louban and Supuyan fled to Kang. Kang killed them and sent their heads to Cao Cao. In 208, Kang sent aid to Balgi in support of his claim to the Goguryeo throne. Accounts differ on whether or not Balgi succeeded. The 12th century &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; says he was defeated by Gyesu, younger brother of Sansang of Goguryeo, whereas Chinese records say that the invasion won, conquering territory where Balgi was settled. Regardless, in 209 Kang invaded Goguryeo again, took some territory and Goguryeo was forced to move its capital further east. Kang died in 220 when his children were too young to rule, so his brother Gongsun Gong succeeded him. Gong maintained his independence, albeit while accepting titles issued by Cao Pi. Gong became ill and was replaced by his nephew Gongsun Yuan in 228. Yuan ruled independently until Sima Yi invaded in 238 and annexed his territory.

===Gongsun Zan===
Gongsun Zan was born to a family of high officials and received education from Lu Zhi and Liu Kuan, in the process becoming friends with Liu Bei. He took office as a local officer in Liaoxi Commandery, where the administrator was so impressed with his appearance and booming voice that he gave his daughter to him in marriage. Later on, Zan became assistant magistrate of a county in Liaodong Commandery and made a name for himself fighting the Wuhuan and Xianbei. He was particularly known for leading a unit of mounted archers who only rode white horses. It was said that he was so well known among the Xianbei that they used his image for target practice. Despite Zan&#x27;s success in halting Xianbei raids on Han territory, he was dismissed for losing a large portion of his men in an attack against numerically superior forces. Zan was eventually reappointed and given command of Wuhuan auxiliaries in 187 to deal with the Liang Province rebellion. For his service he was promoted to Commandant of Cavalry and went on to defeat the rebels Zhang Ju, Zhang Chun, and the Wuhuan chieftain Qiuliju in 188. However Qiuliju escaped and surrendered to the governor of You Province, Liu Yu. Liu Yu was rewarded with rank and enfeoffment, making Zan resentful of him.

When Dong Zhuo took power, he made Gongsun Zan a general in charge of Ji county in Guangyang Commandery under Liu Yu, who became Grand Marshal. In 191 Zan defeated a group of Yellow Turbans moving north from the Shandong Peninsula. His cousin Gongsun Yue died at the hands of Yuan Shao while on a mission to Yuan Shu, making the two enemies. He then seized a part of Ji Province but was badly defeated the next year. Recouping his losses, Zan defeated an invasion by Cui Juye and sent Tian Kai to invade Qing Province, which was also defeated. In 193 a truce was arranged, but Yuan Shao&#x27;s ally Liu Yu attacked Zan anyway, and was defeated and killed. In 195 insurgents led by Xianyu Fu and Yan Rou removed Zan from power with the assistance of Yuan Shao&#x27;s troops. Zan retreated to Yi city where he secluded himself with his harem. He managed to repulse one attack by Qu Yi before Yuan Shao brought his main army in 198 and laid siege to the city. Zan sent his son Xu to seek aid from Zhang Yan, leader of the Heishan bandits. However by the time reinforcements arrived, Yuan Shao&#x27;s sappers had already breached Zan&#x27;s fortifications and Zan killed himself and his family rather than surrender. Gongsun Xu was later killed by the Chuge tribe of the Xiongnu.

===Kong Rong===
Kong Rong was a descendant of Confucius born in 153 to a minor government official, Kong Zhou, in Lu Commandery. As the sixth child Kong Rong showed great wit and harbored aspirations beyond his age. In 169, the reformist Zhang Jian fled the court in fear of the eunuchs and sought refuge at the Kong estate. Kong Rong hid him from the authorities until he left, but they came back later and arrested Kong Rong as well as his brother Kong Bao. Kong Bao claimed responsibility, arguing that Zhang Jian initially sought his aid while his brother only acted as the agent. He was executed.

In the late 170s, Kong Rong joined the offices of Yang Ci, from which position he fought the influence of the palace eunuchs. In 184, Kong Rong sought an audience with He Jin, who gave him employment in the Imperial Censorate. Kong Rong resigned from his position on grounds of disagreements with the head of the Censorate, Zhao She. Later he became General of the Household in charge of the palace guards.

When Dong Zhuo took power in 189, Kong Rong opposed the deposition of Liu Bian. As a result, Kong Rong was demoted and sent to deal with Beihai Commandery, which was experiencing serious troubles with banditry. As Chancellor of Beihai Commandery, Kong Rong sought to restore order by settling the people and building schools. However he was criticized as pretentious and ineffectual, having done little to deal with the Yellow Turbans and local bandits. In 193 he was attacked by the bandit leader Guan Hai. Kong Rong sent his subordinate Taishi Ci to seek aid from Liu Bei. Liu Bei sent a relief force and scattered the bandit army. In 196 Yuan Shao&#x27;s son Yuan Tan attacked Beihai Commandery, but Kong Rong had made no preparations, and instead spent his time in literary pursuits. When Yuan Tan captured Beihai Commandery, Kong Rong fled to Cao Cao, who made him Court Architect. Kong Rong constantly demeaned Cao Cao&#x27;s achievements and made fun of him but was tolerated due to his popularity at court. In 208 Kong Rong finally went too far and was killed for ridiculing Cao Cao in a self-righteous manner. His son and daughter were also executed.

===Liu Biao===
Liu Biao, a distant descendant of Emperor Jing of Han, was born in 142 in Shanyang Commandery. As a child, he studied under the Administrator of Nanyang Commandery, Wang Chang. In the 160s, Liu Biao joined the reformist faction at the Taixue of Luoyang. As a result, he was ousted from office in 169. When the Great Proscription came to an end in 184, Liu Biao was reinstated as a clerk in the offices of General-in-Chief He Jin.

In 190, Sun Jian killed Wang Rui, the Inspector of Jing Province. Liu Biao was appointed the new Inspector of Jing Province, but Yuan Shu was already in control of Nanyang Commandery, so he went further south and set up base in Xiangyang. He was attacked by Sun Jian in 191, but Sun Jian died almost immediately after in a skirmish. In the late 190s a rebellion by Zhang Xiu disrupted Liu Biao&#x27;s territory until Zhang Xiu died in 200. He gave refuge to Liu Bei, who urged him to attack Cao Cao in 207, but Liu Biao declined. In 208 Liu Biao was invaded by Cao Cao in the north and Sun Quan in the south. Liu Biao died that autumn and his son Liu Zong surrendered to Cao Cao.

===Liu Yan and Liu Zhang===
Liu Yan was a descendant of Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing of Han. Seeking to distance himself from the turmoil at the capital, Liu Yan sought and received appointment as Governor of Yi Province in 188. He set his headquarters at Mianzhu in Guanghan Commandery. Soon after he raised troops in the name of Dong Zhuo and appointed the sect leaders Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu as officers. They were sent to attack Su Gu, the Administrator of Hanzhong Commandery, who defied Liu Yan. After Su Gu was defeated, Zhang Lu took Hanzhong Commandery for himself and eliminated Zhang Xiu. Liu Yan recruited troops from migrants and refugees from Central China, creating a unit known as the Dongzhou Troops (東州兵 &quot;dongzhoubing&quot;). The Administrator of Jianwei Commandery, Ren Qi and loyalist Jia Long attacked Liu Yan in 191, but they were defeated and killed. After moving his capital to Luo city, also in Guanghan, Liu Yan formed an alliance with Ma Teng in 194 and attacked Li Jue&#x27;s regime in Chang&#x27;an. The campaign ended in failure and Liu Yan&#x27;s sons Fan and Dan died in the attempt. Liu Yan died the same year after having moved his capital to Chengdu in Shu Commandery, where his son Liu Zhang succeeded him.

Liu Zhang put down an insurrection caused by Hu Mao, an agent of the Chang&#x27;an regime. In 200 Zhang Lu openly defied Liu Zhang, who in retaliation killed Zhang Lu&#x27;s mother, who had been staying at his court as hostage. Zhang Lu invaded Liu Zhang&#x27;s territory, occupying northern Ba Commandery. A follower of Liu Zhang also rebelled at this time due to grievances with the Dongzhou Troops, but he was defeated and killed. After Cao Cao&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208, Liu Zhang formed an alliance with Liu Bei. When Cao Cao&#x27;s general Zhong Yao was sent against Zhang Lu in 211, Liu Zhang invited Liu Bei to Guanghan hoping that someone from the same imperial clan would help him. Liu Bei spent the next year complaining about the lack of supplies, then turned on Liu Zhang, killed his officers, and waged war on him. By 214 Liu Bei&#x27;s forces had advanced to Chengdu, where a siege lasting several weeks occurred before Liu Zhang surrendered. Liu Zhang was exiled to Jing Province where he eventually entered the court of Sun Quan when his general Lü Meng defeated Guan Yu in 219.

===Lü Bu===
Lü Bu killed his patron Ding Yuan at the request of Dong Zhuo and became his bodyguard. In 190 Lü Bu was sent to plunder the tombs of Luoyang. His behavior was unruly and disruptive to his unit, causing his commander Hu Zhen to suffer defeat at the hands of Sun Jian. Lü Bu was also defeated and driven from Luoyang. Conflict between Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu soon came to a head and in 192 Lü Bu conspired with Wang Yun to kill Dong Zhuo. After ambushing and killing Dong Zhuo, Wang Yun&#x27;s government was toppled by Li Jue in less than a month and Lü Bu was forced to flee to Yuan Shu but was turned away because of the unruly behavior of his men. Next Lü Bu visited Zhang Yang and then left when Li Jue offered a price for his head. In 193 he participated in Yuan Shao&#x27;s campaign against the Black Mountain bandits. Once again the brutality of his men caused consternation and Yuan Shao sent Lü Bu back to Luoyang and ordered his escort to kill Lü Bu. Lü Bu managed to avoid assassination and fled. In 194 Lü Bu joined Zhang Chao and Zhang Miao&#x27;s rebellion against Cao Cao in Yan Province. While initially successful, the rebel forces failed to take Puyang in Dong Commandery, and the tide turned against them. By the summer of 195 Lü Bu was forced to flee again, this time to Liu Bei in Xu Province. In 196 Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei. Lü Bu switched sides, capturing Liu Bei&#x27;s assets in Xiapi Commandery, and taking his surrender. After defeating Liu Bei, Lü Bu turned on Yuan Shu and drove back his army. The defeated Liu Bei later fled to Cao Cao, who in 198 sent Xiahou Dun to assist Liu Bei against Lü Bu. Lü Bu was unable to coordinate his commanders, who acted separately, and was driven back to Xiapi Commandery where his officers eventually betrayed him, opening the gates for the opposing army. When Lü Bu tried to persuade Cao Cao to accept him as a subordinate, Liu Bei argued against it. Lü Bu was strangled to death.

===Shi Xie===
Shi Xie was born to Shi Ci in Cangwu Commandery in the year 137. He attended the Taixue in Luoyang before returning home upon his father&#x27;s death and took up the post of Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery in the 180s.

After the Administrator Zhu Fu was killed in 190, Shi Xie and his brothers Yi, Wei, and Wu took full control of Jiaozhou. He ruled from his capital Long Biên (Luy Lâu) in modern Hanoi and brought prosperity to the region, taking in many refugees from the north. His brothers Yi, Wei, and Wu administered the commanderies of Hepu, Jiuzhen, and Nanhai respectively.

In 192, the southernmost district of Rinan Commandery, Xianglin, broke away and became the Kingdom of Lâm Ấp, otherwise known as Champa. Aside from this incident, Shi Xie&#x27;s realm was relatively secluded from the state of endemic warfare and turmoil to the north. He provided support to the general Zhang Jin, situated in Cangwu and Yulin commanderies, in his conflicts with Liu Biao from 196 to 205, but stopped after the general&#x27;s death. Shi Xie played no further role in the military affairs of the warlord states.

When Shi Wu died in 200, the Shi family lost control of the Pearl River region, but Shi Xie contented himself with ruling the reduced portion of Jiaozhi. Shi Xie was well disposed towards the northern warlords and acquiesced to Sun Quan&#x27;s chosen Inspector of Jiaozhi, Bu Zhi, who visited Nanhai Commandery in 211. Shi Xie then sent his son Xin to Sun Quan as hostage in 217. Reduced to only Jiaozhi Commandery, Shi Xie died in 226 at the age of 90. His son Shi Hui was given the post of prefect in Jiuzhen Commandery while Chen Shi became prefect of Jiaozhi Commandery. At this point Sun Quan&#x27;s agent, Lü Dai, decided to split Jiaozhou in half with the northern portion (Guangzhou) assigned to himself and the southern half, the new Jiaozhou, to Dai Liang. Shi Hui refused to let Dai Liang into the province and decided to rebel. His officials opposed him in rebelling against Sun Quan and laid siege to him in his capital, however they were unable to breach the city gates and were eventually forced to make peace. Lü Dai contacted Shi Hui&#x27;s cousin and sent him with an offer of clemency on the condition that Shi Hui surrender peacefully. Shi Hui accepted the offer and together with his brothers and sons surrendered. Lü Dai reneged on his promise and beheaded them all, after which he abolished the two provinces, once again merging them together into Jiaozhou.

After Shi Xie&#x27;s death, the southern frontier continued to be viewed as an area of barbarians in the Han imagination. When Xue Zong visited the south in 231, he described the place in the following manner:

Shi Xie is primarily remembered today in Vietnam as Sĩ Nhiếp, the father of education and Buddhism, which he patronized greatly during his reign. He was credited with compiling a dictionary of Classical Chinese terms explained in vernacular Vietnamese language several centuries later. According to Stephen O&#x27;Harrow, Shi Xie was &quot;the first Vietnamese.&quot;

===Yuan Shao, Shang, Xi, and Tan===

Yuan Shao was born to a highly distinguished official family who had held office as one of the Three Ducal Ministers, the three highest posts below emperor, for three generations. The exact circumstances of Yuan Shao&#x27;s birth and lineage are not clear but it&#x27;s said that he was the son of Yuan Feng by a concubine, who then chose to adopt the lineage of his uncle Yuan Cheng (who lacked an heir). This was a source of contention between Shao and his half brother Yuan Shu, who was the son of Feng and his chief wife, making him senior to Shao within the Feng family. However, because Shao was adopted into the family of Feng&#x27;s elder brother Cheng, he became the senior cousin, and higher up in the Yuan hierarchy than Shu. Envious of Shao&#x27;s greater prestige and popularity, Shu referred to him as &quot;our family slave&quot; and claimed that Shao was not a true member of the Yuan clan.

Yuan Shao grew to be a handsome young man and a popular leader among his peers in Luoyang. At some point, he and Cao Cao raided a wedding, but after Cao Cao kidnapped the bride, he directed the pursuers to Shao. In the late 160s, Shao, then in his 20s, aided the reformist faction in escaping persecution by the eunuchs. After that he received appointment as a county magistrate in Dong Commandery. He then left office for six years to mourn the death of his adoptive mother and father. Upon returning to Luoyang, Shao entered the service of the Imperial Censorate, and rose through the ranks until he became a colonel in the Army of the Western Garden by 188.

Following the death of Emperor Ling of Han in 189, Yuan Shao urged He Jin to destroy the eunuchs. When He Jin was killed, Shao led a massacre of the eunuchs. After Dong Zhuo came to power, Shao fled east and formed a coalition army to embark on a Campaign against Dong Zhuo. Based in Suanzao in Chenliu Commandery, the coalition army met with little success throughout 190, so in 191 Shao took over Ji Province from Han Fu. When the coalition dissolved, Shao sent men against Yuan Shu&#x27;s officer Sun Jian in Yingchuan Commandery. Gongsun Zan attacked Shao but was defeated at Jie Bridge between Julu and Qinghe commanderies. Shao set his capital at the city of Ye (Hebei) in Wei Commandery. In 193 Shao attacked the Black Mountain bandits and forced them into hiding. In 195, Zang Hong rebelled against Shao but was defeated and sentenced to death. Shao&#x27;s follower Chen Rong criticized him of dishonorable conduct and was executed as well. With the support of the Wuhuan, he made the final attack on Gongsun Zan in 198 and eliminated him the beginning of next year. In 199 Shao became hostile to Cao Cao and moved against him. His army moved too slow however and in early winter of 200, Cao Cao destroyed two of his supply trains at the Battle of Guandu. His army scattered and fled. Shao became ill and died in 202. He was succeeded by his son Yuan Shang.

Cao Cao attacked in the autumn. By the summer of 203 Yuan Shang had been defeated and driven back to Ye, however Cao Cao decided to withdraw at this point. Shang came into open conflict with his brother Yuan Tan, who fled east. In 204 Shang besieged his brother at Pingyuan Commandery but Cao Cao moved against him at Ye and forced him to flee to Zhongshan Commandery where Tan attacked him. Shang fled again to his other brother Yuan Xi in You Province while Cao Cao attacked Tan at Nanpi in Bohai Commandery and killed him. In 205 Shang and Xi were ejected from their territory by mutineers and fled to the Wuhuan under Tadun, but Tadun was defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. They fled for the last time, this time to Gongsun Kang, who killed them and sent their heads to Cao Cao.

===Yuan Shu===
Yuan Shu was born to a highly distinguished official family who had held office as one of the Three Ducal Ministers, the three highest posts below emperor, for three generations. Despite acquiring a respectful reputation for himself and later becoming General of the Household Rapid as Tigers, Yuan Shu was ultimately overshadowed by his more popular and successful half-brother Yuan Shao.

Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao urged He Jin to kill the eunuchs at Luoyang. When Dong Zhuo took over, Yuan Shu fled to Nanyang Commandery. His army took part in the Campaign against Dong Zhuo under Sun Jian&#x27;s command, but when Sun Jian returned from Luoyang, Yuan Shao became hostile and sent Zhou Ang against him. Yuan Shu allied with Gongsun Zan while his half brother allied with Liu Biao. Sun Jian soon died in a skirmish while on campaign against Liu Biao so Yuan Shu withdrew east to Chenliu Commandery where he was driven away as well by Cao Cao in 193. He then retreated to Shouchun in Jiujiang Commandery. The next year Yuan Shu sent Wu Jing against Governor of Yang Province, Liu Yao, with the extra help of Sun Ce in 195. In 196 Yuan Shu defeated Liu Bei in Xu Province with the aid of Lü Bu, who then changed sides and forced Yuan Shu&#x27;s forces back to Shouchun. In 197 Yuan Shu declared himself emperor of the Zhong dynasty, which made everybody hate him. Sun Ce abandoned him while Cao Cao seized territory north of the Huai River. His fledgling dynasty was left in ruin and in 199 Yuan Shu attempted to escape to Qing Province, but was driven back to Shouchun, where he died outside the city. His family fled to Liu Xun, Administrator of Lujiang Commandery. Liu Xun later fled to Cao Cao when Sun Ce captured his capital. He was executed for extortion and corruption at a later date.

===Zhang Lu===
Zhang Lu was the head of a Daoist movement known as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. in 190 Liu Yan, Governor of Yi Province, sent Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu (not related) against the rebellious Administrator of Hanzhong Commandery, Su Gu. Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu killed Su Gu and took the territory for themselves. Zhang Lu killed Zhang Xiu and established a theocracy with religious Libationers as the primary civil authority. He preached confession of sins and the use of charms to cure illness. Minor wrongdoers were forced to become public servants who provided refreshments for travelers on the road. Alcohol was banned. In 200 Zhang Lu moved against Liu Zhang and seized northern Ba Commandery. His mother, who had been kept as a captive by Liu Zhang, was killed. In 214 Zhang Lu provided Ma Chao with some troops but when Ma Chao asked for more, he refused, after which Ma Chao turned to Liu Bei. In 215 Cao Cao attacked Zhang Lu. After his brother Zhang Wei was defeated, Zhang Lu fled to the Zong and Banshun natives for protection but they surrendered to Cao Cao and Zhang Lu was forced to submit as well. Cao Cao treated him well and his family was given honored positions at court. Zhang Lu died in Ye city in 216.

===Zhang Yang===
Born in Yunzhong Commandery, Zhang Yang was noted for his courage and fighting skills. He served as Assistant Officer for Military Affairs in Bing Province before joining the Army of the Western Garden as an acting major in 188.

In 189, General-in-Chief He Jin sent Zhang Yang to attack the hill bandits in Shangdang Commandery, however He Jin died later that year and Dong Zhuo seized power at the capital. Zhang Yang tried to seize Shangdang Commandery for himself. While he failed to oust the commandery&#x27;s Administrator, he managed to gather several thousand followers while plundering the local counties. When the coalition against Dong Zhuo formed, he attempted to join it, but his partner the wandering Xiongnu mercenary Yufuluo forced him to attack Yuan Shao instead. They were defeated at the city of Ye. After that Zhang Yang received commission from Dong Zhuo as Administrator of Henei Commandery, so he based himself at Yewang across the Yellow River from Luoyang. In 192 and 193 he gave refuge to Lü Bu. When Cao Cao attacked Lü Bu at Xiapi in 198, Zhang Yang attempted to strike Cao Cao from the rear, but was killed by his own officer Yang Chou, who held a grudge against Lü Bu. After he defected to Cao Cao, Yang Chou was in turn killed by another officer Sui Gu who then attempted to seek help from Yuan Shao. He was defeated the following year by Cao Cao&#x27;s officers Shi Huan and Cao Ren

==Minor warlords==

===Gao Gan===
Born to Gao Gong in Chenliu Commandery, Gao Gan was a nephew of Yuan Shao. He played an instrumental role in convincing Han Fu to hand over Ji Province to Yuan Shao in 191. As reward, Yuan Shao made Gao Gan Governor of Bing Province. In 202, Gao Gan joined the Southern Xiongnu chanyu Huchuquan in attacking Hedong Commandery. They were defeated and Huchuquan surrendered to Cao Cao&#x27;s officer Zhong Yao. Gao Gan surrendered to Cao Cao in 204 but felt unsatisfied with his new position as Inspector of Bing Province. In 205, Gao Gao seized Shangdang Commandery and invaded Hedong Commandery. Gao Gan failed to take Ye and was driven back. In 206, Cao Cao personally led an attack on Gao Gao, forcing him to flee to the Xiongnu and then to the south in Jing Province, where he was captured and killed.

===Han Fu===
Han Fu was appointed Governor of Ji Province in 189. While he nominally participated in the Campaign against Dong Zhuo, he stayed at the city of Ye. After the coalition broke up, he became hostile to Yuan Shao in 191 and denied him supplies. Using his family connections, Yuan Shao intimidated Han Fu into handing over his position to him. After doing so, Han Fu&#x27;s family was constantly harassed until they fled to Zhang Miao. He eventually killed himself.

===Liu Chong===

Liu Chong, otherwise known as Prince Min of Chen, was the son of Liu Cheng. In 173, Liu Chong and former Chancellor Wei Yin offered sacrifices to Huang–Lao for good fortune, but the practice was seen as reprehensible by the senior officials. The official Shi Qian accused Wei Yin and Liu Chong of impiety. An official inquiry was carried out which resulted in the arrest of both Shi Qian and Wei Yin. They were both executed and no further investigation of Liu Chong occurred. Liu Chong was said to be a fine shot with the crossbow and had written a treatise on the weapon called the &quot;Nushe bifa&quot;. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in 184, he raised several thousand archers and brought them to the capital where his presence quelled any unrest. In 190, he formed an alliance with Dong Zhuo and styled himself General Who Supports Han while his Chancellor Luo Jun maintained his territory in Chen Commandery. When Yuan Shu&#x27;s request for supplies was denied by Luo Jun in 197, he sent assassins who killed both Luo Jun and Liu Chong.

===Liu Yao===
Liu Yao, son of Liu Yu and nephew of Liu Chong, was born in 157 in Donglai Commandery. At the age of 18 he saved his uncle Liu Wei from a kidnapping. He became a county magistrate in Liang but resigned because he disapproved of the favor shown by the Chancellor to eunuchs. Liu Yao then served as an Assistant Officer in Qing Province and in the clerical bureau at the capital, but refused an invitation to join the Censorate.

In the 190s Liu Yao established himself in Danyang Commandery while his officer Zhu Hao held Yuzhang Commandery. In 195 Sun Ce defeated Liu Yao&#x27;s forces and forced him to flee to Yuzhang Commandery, where Ze Rong had previously seized power. He eliminated Ze Rong but otherwise played no role in external affairs until 198 when he died. His family entered the court of Sun Ce and were treated well.

===Liu Yu===
Liu Yu, son of Liu Shu, held local office his county and became a magistrate in Donghai Commandery. It was said that his virtue protected the county from a plague of locusts. He was promoted to Inspector of You Province, where he wore the local clothing of fur and felt. His government was praised by the people and he received regular tribute from the non-Chinese. In 184, he was sent as Chancellor to Ganling, where his record of humane rule settled the hotbed of Yellow Turban discontent. In 188, he was sent back to You Province. As Governor, he persuaded the Wuhuan chieftain Qiuliju to surrender and murdered the rebel Zhang Chun. Yuan Shao suggested that he be made regent instead of Dong Zhuo or even take the throne for himself, but Liu Yu declined. Under Liu Yu&#x27;s governorship, You Province prospered as a result of policies encouraging silk production, market trading, and production of salt and iron. The province&#x27;s prosperity and low grain prices attracted many southern refugees. In 191 Liu Yu allied with Yuan Shao, and Gongsun Zan with Yuan Shu. In 193 Liu Yu attempted to oust Gongsun Zan, who had built a fortified camp within the walls of his capital in Guangyang Commandery, but failed. Gongsun Zan counterattacked, driving him from the city. Liu Yu was captured a few days later and executed.

Lu Kang was born in 125 to an influential local family of Kuaiji Commandery. He served as an officer under the Administrator Li Su, who was later executed for his cowardice. Lu Kang escorted the Administrator&#x27;s body home to carry out a full mourning, for which he gained a reputation for loyalty. He went on to become a magistrate in Bohai Commandery and ended the military levy there and governed the territory through honest and generous government. In 185, Lu Kang protested the extravagance and corruption involved in the rebuilding of palaces in Luoyang and as a result was dismissed for a time before he became a consultant at the capital. In 188, he became Administrator of Lujiang Commandery in 188. He put down the rebel chieftain Huang Rang and continued to send reports and tribute to the capital even as the Han dynasty fell apart. In 193, Yuan Shu asked Lu Kang for supplies and was refused. Yuan sent Sun Ce against Lu Kang, who surrendered after a two-year siege, in 195. Lu Kang died a month later.

In 193 he entered a loose alliance with Yuan Shu and Gongsun Zan, but that winter Tao Qian&#x27;s soldiers killed Cao Song, Cao Cao&#x27;s father. In retaliation Cao Cao brought the full force of his army down on him, ravaging Pengcheng and Xiapi commanderies. Tao Qian fled to Donghai Commandery in 194 and received the aid of Tian Kai and Liu Bei, but died from illness soon afterwards.

===Wang Lang===

He served as a gentleman cadet and county magistrate in Pengcheng Commandery. He left office when his patron Yang Ci died and refused invitations from the capital. In 191, Wang Lang became Headquarters Officer to Tao Qian. Tao Qian made Wang Lang the Administrator of Kuaiji Commandery, where Wang Lang established a luxurious court, which recorded one of the earliest local histories of China. In 196, Sun Ce invaded Wang Lang&#x27;s territory and forced him to surrender, but Wang Lang refused to serve him. Two years later Wang Lang was allowed to leave for Cao Cao&#x27;s court, where he would eventually rise to the position of Excellency under the rule of Cao Pi in 220. During his career he campaigned against the use of mutilation as a punishment and argued for the importance of education as a means to reduce the need for severe punishments. Wang Lang died in 228, leaving a collection of memorials and commentaries on the classics.

===Zhang Meng===
Zhang Meng was the Administrator of Wuwei Commandery. In 206 Zhang Meng killed the Inspector Handan Shang and promised to pay retribution to anyone who attended to his corpse. An Assistant Officer loyal to Handan Shang carried out the mourning rites and went to Zhang Meng&#x27;s residence to seek revenge for his superior. Recognizing his great sense of loyalty, Zhang Meng decided not to put him to death, and let Pang Yu leave for Jiuquan Commandery. In 210 Zhang Meng was defeated by Han Sui.

===Zhu Jun===
Zhu Jun&#x27;s father died when he was very young. His mother raised him working as a silk seller. After working as a clerk in his local county office, Zhu Jun joined the commandery staff, where he spent almost 20 years before becoming Registrar to the Administrator Yin Duan. In 173, Yin Duan was reported by provincial authorities for failing to defeat the rebel Xu Chang, but Zhu Jun intercepted the letter, resulting in a reduced sentence for Yin Duan. Zhu Jun went on to become a magistrate in Donghai Commandery before he was sent to Jiaozhi in 181 as Inspector to deal with a rebellion by Liang Long. He raised 5,000 troops from his home in Kuaiji Commandery and defeated the rebellion within a matter of weeks. Zhu Jun was recalled to the capital and promoted to Counsellor Remonstrant. In 184, Zhu Jun and Huangfu Song were sent to deal with the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the south. They experienced some setbacks but managed to pacify Yingchuan, Runan, and Chen commanderies by autumn. Zhu Jun then moved to Nanyang Commandery and defeated the rebels there through deception. In 185, he was promoted again but left office when his mother died. He returned to the capital at some point and took up a number of posts.

When Dong Zhuo seized power in 189, he wanted to make Zhu Jun his chief assistant, but Zhu Jun refused in protest of moving the capital to Chang&#x27;an. Dong Zhuo left Zhu Jun in charge of Luoyang after he headed west for Chang&#x27;an. Zhu Jun defected to the coalition forces and moved south in 191 to Jing Province. In the following year, he was defeated by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s commanders Guo Si and Li Jue. He returned to the imperial court after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s assassination and served until 195 when he was taken captive by Guo Si, who had by then broken out in open conflict with Li Jue. Zhu Jun fell ill and died soon after. He was noted for being filial and generous to his peers.

==Former rebels==
===Han Sui===
Han Sui was born to an influential family in Jincheng Commandery. His father held appointment at the capital and in 178, Han Sui followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a Reporting Officer at Luoyang. During his stay at the capital, he became friends with Cao Cao, and was instrumental in urging General-in-Chief He Jin to eliminate the eunuchs. However He Jin was reluctant and after some time Han Sui returned to his homeland in the west, where he became Assistant Officer of Liang Province.

In 184, Han Sui and his colleague Bian Zhang joined Beigong Boyu in the Liang Province rebellion. Together they attacked Chang&#x27;an in 185 and 188/189. After their first failure to take Chang&#x27;an, Han Sui killed Beigong Boyu and seized command himself with Wang Guo as a figurehead. They failed to take Chang&#x27;an again in 189. Wang Guo was deposed and the rebel forces split up into three groups: Han Sui in Jincheng Commandery, Ma Teng in Longxi Commandery, and Song Jian on the upper Yellow River. He initially supported Dong Zhuo and his successor Li Jue, but turned on them in 194 when he joined Ma Teng in attacking Chang&#x27;an. They were defeated at Changping Slope northwest of Chang&#x27;an and Han Sui was forced to withdraw to Youfufeng Commandery. Han Sui fell out with Ma Teng, possibly due to the machinations of Cao Cao&#x27;s agent Zhong Yao, and they began to skirmish with Ma Teng taking the heavier losses, causing him to join Cao Cao. In 210 Han Sui defeated Zhang Meng in Wuwei Commandery. In 211 Cao Cao sent troops against Zhang Lu. Believing that this was a preliminary attack on themselves, Han Sui and Ma Chao forged an alliance and confronted the enemy troops with initial success, driving them away. Later, Cao Cao personally led an army against the western alliance. When the three armies met at Huayin, Han Sui attempted to negotiate with Cao Cao and talked of the old days when they were friends at Luoyang, but Cao Cao&#x27;s replies were mixed. The two sides agreed on a day to do battle. Han Sui and Ma Chao were defeated and forced to retreat. In 214 Xiahou Yuan drove Han Sui from Hanyang Commandery. Han Sui&#x27;s officer Yan Xing rebelled against him and defected to Cao Cao. Han Sui died in 215 at the age of 70.

===Ma Teng and Ma Chao===
Ma Teng&#x27;s family claimed descent from the famed general Ma Yuan, but his father was quite poor while his mother was of Qiang origin. Ma Teng grew to be quite tall at eight chi in height (185 cm). He made a living cutting firewood before joining the militia against the Liang Province rebellion.

Ma Teng rose to major under Inspector Geng Bi until Geng Bi was killed by mutineers in 187. Ma Teng then joined the mutineers, styling himself a general under the command of Wang Guo. After Wang Guo was defeated in 189, Ma Teng set himself up as an independent ruler in Longxi Commandery. When Dong Zhuo retreated to Chang&#x27;an, he persuaded Ma Teng and Han Sui to assist him against the other warlords. Ma Teng continued his allegiance to the Chang&#x27;an regime for a time even after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death and usurpation by Li Jue. In 194, he betrayed Li Jue and attacked Chang&#x27;an with the aid of Han Sui and supporters in Luoyang. Ma Teng and Han Sui were defeated at Changping Slope northwest of Chang&#x27;an and he retreated to Liang Province. Around 197 Ma Teng began to quarrel with Han Sui and their forces engaged in battle with Ma Teng losing the exchange. His son Ma Chao was wounded in battle by Yan Xing while his wife and other sons were also lost, forcing him to retreat to Youfufeng Commandery. He threw in his lot with Cao Cao in 202, sending Ma Chao to fight Yuan Shao&#x27;s officer Guo Yuan in Hedong Commandery, and in 205 he himself campaigned against Sun Quan&#x27;s officer Zhang Cheng. In 208 Ma Teng was enfeoffed but kept hostage in Ye while his son Ma Chao succeeded him in Liang Province. In 211 Ma Chao and Han Sui became hostile to Cao Cao. Ma Teng was killed the next year.

Ma Chao and Han Sui were defeated by Cao Cao at Huayin and retreated west. In 213 Ma Chao made an alliance with the Qiang and Di people as well as Zhang Lu. He then seized Hanyang Commandery. In the autumn an uprising by Yang Fu and Jiang Xu defeated Ma Chao and forced him to take refuge with Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu provided Ma Chao with troops to make an attempt to re-establish himself in Liang Province, but Ma Chao was defeated by Xiahou Yuan. Realizing that Zhang Lu would not provide him with any more troops, Ma Chao joined Liu Bei, who made him a general. Under Liu Bei, Ma Chao campaigned against Cao Cao in Wudu Commandery in 217 but failed to make any headway. Ma Chao died in 222.

===Song Jian===
Song Jian led an uprising in Liang Province in 184. After 185 he returned to his home county of Fuhan and declared himself King of the Sources of the River Who Will Pacify Han. In the winter of 214 Cao Cao&#x27;s general Xiahou Yuan attacked Fuhan and killed Song Jian and his officers.

===Gan Ning===
Gan Ning was the leader of an influential vigilante bandit group in Ba Commandery known for their expertise with bows and crossbows. Gan Ning treated local officials who aided him generously but plundered the territories of those who did not. Later he abandoned his life as a youxia and studied philosophy.

When Liu Yan, the Governor of Yi Province, died in 194, his son Liu Zhang refused to hand over the province to the court appointed Inspector, Hu Mao. Gan Ning aided Hu Mao in his conflict with Liu Zhang but they were defeated. Gan Ning fled with 800 followers to Liu Biao and then Huang Zu, who treated him with disdain due to his past history as a bandit. At the Battle of Xiakou in 203, Huang Zu&#x27;s fleet was defeated in an attack by Sun Quan, and he himself was nearly captured until Gan Ning killed the enemy general, Ling Cao, with an arrow. Despite being saved by Gan Ning, Huang Zu continued to treat his savior coldly and refused to bestow upon him any rewards or promotions. He even tried to induce Gang Ning&#x27;s men to abandon him.

In 207, Gan Ning was assigned to an eastern border post with the help of a sympathetic officer, Su Fei. From there he crossed over the border and defected to Sun Quan, where he found better terms of service. When Huang Zu was destroyed by Sun Quan in the following year, Gan Ning spoke in favor of Su Fei, saving his life. Gan Ning participated in several following campaigns, notably at the Battle of Yiling where he held off Cao Ren&#x27;s forces long enough for reinforcements to arrive despite being outnumbered five to one. In 215, he maintained the rearguard when Sun Quan was defeated at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, saving his lord&#x27;s life. In 217, he took a small raiding party into Cao Cao&#x27;s main camp at the Battle of Ruxu and decimated the enemy forces. Gan Ning died in 220.

===Gong Du===

===White Tiger Yan===
Yan Baihu, or &quot;White Tiger Yan&quot;, was a bandit leader of possibly Shanyue origins. When Sun Ce came to Wu Commandery in 195, Yan Baihu gave refuge to the displaced Xu Gong and threatened the flank of Sun Ce&#x27;s army. However Sun Ce paid him no attention and the two avoided any altercations. In 197, Cao Cao&#x27;s agent Chen Yu provoked Yan into rebellion. Sun Ce sent Lü Fan to drive out Chen Yu while he himself attacked Yan. The defeated Yan fled south to join Xu Zhao but died soon afterwards. Remnants of Yan&#x27;s band joined Xu Gong in 200 to threaten Sun Ce&#x27;s rear as he attacked Huang Zu in the west. Sun Ce decided to retreat and finish off the bandits once and for all, only to fall into an ambush and die at their hands.

===Yang Feng===
Yang Feng was a leader of the Bobo bandit group in Xihe Commandery. He joined Li Jue but rebelled against him in 195. In 196 Yang Feng aided Emperor Xian of Han in escaping the capital. Dong Zhao approached Yang Feng on behalf of Cao Cao and convinced him to let the emperor travel to Xu city. Later Yang Feng tried to interfere in the move and was defeated by Cao Cao in battle, after which he fled to Yuan Shu. In 197 Yang Feng rebelled against Yuan Shu in support of Lü Bu, however Lü Bu did not come to his aid and Yang Feng was forced to flee to Liu Bei. Liu Bei invited him to a banquet, at which he was bound and killed.

===Zhang Yan===
Zhang Yan, originally Chu Yan, was the leader of a bandit group in the Taihang Mountains in 184. At some point he joined another bandit, Oxhorn Zhang, but Zhang was fatally wounded in a raid and died soon afterwards. His last act was to transfer his men over to Chu Yan, who took the name of Zhang to honor his patron. Zhang Yan went on to create a bandit confederacy known as the Black Mountain bandits that ravaged the neighboring commanderies of Changshan, Zhao, Zhongshan, Shangdang, and Henei. In 190 Zhang Yan had a loose alliance with Gongsun Zan against Yuan Shao. In 193 Yuan Shao attacked the Black Mountain bandits, forcing them off the southern hills and into the mountains. When Yuan Shao made his final attack on Gongsun Zan in 199, Zhang Yan tried to save him but failed. Zhang Yan surrendered to Cao Cao when he took over Ji Province in 205. He was made a general as well as a marquis.

===Zheng Jiang===
A woman bandit active in Dongping Commandery about 210. Apparently her appearance was foretold in a dream of Liu Zhen, one of Cao Cao&#x27;s staff, where she was represented by a snake with four legs. She was defeated soon after. It is not clear in the text if she was a single person or two women named Zheng and Jiang.

===Zu Lang===
Zu Lang was a local leader who defeated Sun Ce in a skirmish in 194 and then driven into the southern hills by Wu Jing, Sun Ce&#x27;s maternal uncle. He was eventually captured but Sun Ce showed him no ill will and recruited him into his staff.

==Yellow Turbans==
Zhang Rao, Guan Hai, He Man, He Yi, Huang Shao, Liu Pi, Xu He, and Sima Ju were leaders of the Yellow Turbans during the early 190s. They had substantial followings numbering in the tens of thousands.

In 192, Zhang Rao defeated Kong Rong&#x27;s forces.

In 193, Guan Hai besieged Kong Rong but was defeated by Liu Bei.

In 196, Cao Cao took to the field against the other Yellow Turbans and defeated Huang Shao, after which He Man and He Yi surrendered.

In 200, Liu Pi supported Yuan Shao&#x27;s invasion from the north by plundering the region around Cao Cao&#x27;s headquarters at Xu city. He was later joined by Liu Bei, whom Yuan Shao sent to assist him, but they were defeated by Cao Ren. Liu Pi was killed.

In 206, Sima Ju and Xu He attacked a number of cities in Qing Province. Cao Cao sent Xiahou Yuan, Zang Ba, and Lü Qian with a large force to deal with them. After several engagements and heavy casualties on both sides, the two Yellow Turban rebels were killed.

==Non-Han actors==
===Champa===
The Cham people in Xianglin, the southernmost district of Rinan Commandery, broke away and became the Kingdom of Lâm Ấp (Champa) in 192.

In 248, Lâm Ấp seized Rinan Commandery. Due to the ensuing turmoil in Jiuzhen Commandery involving Lady Triệu, Eastern Wu was unable to retaliate.

===Di===
The Di (氐; not to be confused with the Northern &quot;Di&quot; (狄)) were a farming people related to the Qiang living in what is now eastern Gansu Province. Many of the Di tribes had become vassals to the Han dynasty since the 2nd century BC and maintained a relatively peaceful relationship for the most part. However, the Di began to frequently rebel during and after the fall of Han.

In the 210s, the Di tribes such as the ones led by Agui (阿貴) and Qianwan (千萬) allied themselves with the northwestern warlords, Ma Chao, Han Sui and Zhang Lu. After they were defeated, many of the Di came under the control of Cao Cao. Their homeland soon became a frontier between the Cao Wei and Shu Han, and the Di tribes often vacillated their allegiance between the two sides. In 219, Cao Cao, looking to deter them from allying with Liu Bei, had 50,000 of the Di people relocated north to the commanderies along the Wei River. During the northern expeditions of Zhuge Liang and Jiang Wei, winning and maintaining the support of the Di tribes, along with the Qiang and other ethnic minorities in the region, became a strategic objective for both Wei and Shu Han. The Di also joined the Xianbei, Tufa Shujineng when he rebelled against the Western Jin dynasty between 270 and 280.

The Di went on to form three of the later Sixteen Kingdoms: Cheng-Han (304-347), Former Qin (351-394) and Later Liang (386-403).

===Goguryeo===
The Korean kingdom of Goguryeo was invaded by Gongsun Kang in 204, resulting in the Daifang Commandery. In 208, Kang sent aid to Balgi in support of his claim to the Goguryeo throne. According to the 12th century chronicle &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, the invasion was defeated by Gyesu, younger brother of Sansang of Goguryeo. However this is not reported in the Chinese records, which state that the invasion was a success and Balgi was settled in conquered territory. K.H.J. Gardiner says that this is because the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; sought to reverse the reality of defeat in a number of instances and questioned both the existence of Gyesu and his victory. Gongsun Kang took some territory and Goguryeo was forced to move its capital further east. Goguryeo re-established in its former territory and established dominance over the tribes at the mouth of the Yalu River sometime before 233. In 238, Goguryeo allied with Cao Wei to overthrow the Liaodong regime. Goguryeo raided the Xuantu Commandery in 242. In retaliation, Cao Wei invaded Goguryeo from 244 to 245. The Wei general Guanqiu Jian sacked the Goguryeo capital of Hwando, sent its king fleeing, and broke the tributary relationships between Goguryeo and the other tribes of Korea that formed much of Goguryeo&#x27;s economy. Although the king evaded capture and eventually settled in a new capital, Goguryeo was reduced to such insignificance that for half a century there was no mention of the state in Chinese historical texts.

=== Lushuihu ===
The Lushuihu, literally meaning &quot;Black River Barbarians&quot;, was an ethnic group that resided around the area of modern-day Gansu. Their exact origin is still debated by scholars today, with one theory stating that they were a branch of the Xiongnu, while another suggests that they were descendants of the Lesser Yuezhi that intermingled with the Qiang people. In 222, their leaders, Zhiyuanduo (治元多) and Yijiianjiqie (伊健妓妾) rebelled in the Hexi Corridor but was swiftly defeated by Cao Wei forces. The Lushuihu later founded the one of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Northern Liang (397–439).

===Nanman===
====Banshun and Zong====

The Banshun, also known as the Bandun Man, which literally means &quot;board shield barbarians&quot;, were a native people of Ba Commandery, Yi Province, who often served as elite troops in the Han army against other peoples such as the Qiang and the natives of Wuling Commandery. They rebelled in 179 due to unrest caused by the Yellow Turban Rebellion, but when amnesty was issued by Cao Qian in 182, the rebellion was ended. There was another brief uprising in 188 but it amounted to nothing. Related to the Banshun were the neighboring Zong people, who became interested in the mysticism of the Celestial Master Zhang Lu and moved north to the border of his territory. When Cao Cao attacked Zhang Lu in the summer of 215, he fled to Duhu of the Cong and Fuhu of the Banshun for refuge. However Duhu and Fuhu surrendered to Cao Cao in the autumn and received appointment, with Zhang Lu following in the winter. In 219 Liu Bei&#x27;s officer Huang Quan attacked them and drove several non-Chinese groups north into Cao Cao&#x27;s territory. In the north, the Zong people mingled with the local Di people and became known as the Ba-Di, which later found one of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Cheng-Han (304-347)

====Gaoding====
Gaoding was a powerful chieftain in Yuexi Commandery. In 218 he led an attack on Jianwei Commandery but was repelled by the Administrator Li Yan. He caused trouble again in 223 and was killed in Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Southern Campaign two years later.

====Meng Huo====

Meng Huo was a local leader of the Nanman mentioned in &quot;Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Pei Songzhi. In 225, Meng Huo rebelled with Yong Kai. He was captured by Zhuge Liang seven times before he surrendered. Meng Huo&#x27;s role was greatly expanded upon in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in which he is portrayed as the king of the Nanman and husband to Lady Zhurong, a descendant of the God of Fire. In the &quot;Romance&quot;, Meng Huo was described riding a red horse, wearing a golden inlaid headdress, a belt with a clasp in the image of a lion’s face, boots with pointed toes that were green, and a pair of swords chased with pine amber at his waist. Later he rode into battle on a red ox, wearing rhinoceros armour while wielding shield and sword. He enlisted the aid of his fellow kings Wutugu, who commanded an army of 30,000 invincible rattan armour troops, and Mulu, who rode a white elephant and deployed wild beasts in battle. Although his allies were defeated by Zhuge Liang&#x27;s anachronistic gunpowder weapons and killed, Meng Huo was repeatedly captured and released until he surrendered and became a local administrator.

====Yong Kai====
Yong Kai was a powerful chieftain in Yizhou Commandery. In 215, Yong Kai killed the Administrator Zheng Ang and defected to Sun Quan. Sun Quan named Yong Kai Administrator of Yongchang Commandery but actually distrusted him and ordered his officers to keep him out of that territory. In 223, Yong Kai captured the Administrator Zhang Yi and sent him to Sun Quan. In 225, Yong Kai was killed by another chieftain, Gao Ding.

=== Qiang ===
The Qiang referred to groups of western pastoral nomads that lived in areas of present-day Gansu and Qinghai. Since the Western Han dynasty, the Qiang had been migrating into the Guanzhong region to practice agriculture, especially so as their ally, the Xiongnu empire, began to decline. They had a troubled relationship with the Han; though they were occasionally allowed to resettle, they also suffered oppression at the hands of the local Chinese administrators, leading to rebellions that drained the Han military and economy. In 156 AD, the general, Duan Jiong led an extermination campaign against the Qiang, massacring a great number of their people.

Despite the setback, the Qiang were nonetheless the main instigator of the Liang Province rebellion in 184, signalling the downfall of the Han dynasty. Unlike their previous rebellions, they allied themselves with the Chinese warlords in the northwest such as Ma Teng and Han Sui. Ma Teng himself was a half-Qiang through his mother, and he and his family had been living among the Qiang tribes. As the rebellion progressed, the Qiang seemed to have quietly withdrew from the conflict, allowing the local Han rebels to take the reins. In 211, the Qiang aided Ma Teng&#x27;s son, Ma Chao in his war against Cao Cao, but were eventually brought under the latter&#x27;s control after he conquered the region.

With northwestern China as a target of expansion for the Shu Han, one of the main objectives during the northern expeditions of Zhuge Liang and Jiang Wei was to win over the Qiang tribes living in Cao Wei territory. Jiang Wei&#x27;s earlier expeditions saw Qiang chieftains like Ehe (餓何) and Shaoge (燒戈) rebelling in support of Shu Han, but they were all suppressed by Wei forces led by Guo Huai. The Qiang also fought as soldiers for both Cao Wei and Shu Han. After the fall of Shu Han, many of them later joined the Xianbei chieftain, Tufa Shujineng in his rebellion against the Western Jin dynasty from 270 to 280.

The Qiang continued to form a significant portion of the population in the northwest after the Three Kingdoms. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, the Qiang founded the Later Qin dynasty (384–417).

===Shanyue===
The Shanyue &quot;Mountain Yue&quot; were a group of Austro-Asiatic people related to the Vietnamese who lived in the mountain regions of modern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Fujian. In 203, they rebelled against Sun Quan&#x27;s rule and were defeated by the generals Lü Fan, Cheng Pu, and Taishi Ci. In 217, Sun Quan appointed Lu Xun supreme commander of an army to suppress martial activities by the Shanyue in Guiji (modern Shaoxing). Captured Shanyue tribesmen were recruited into the army. In 234, Zhuge Ke was made governor of Danyang. Under his governorship, the region was cleansed of the Shanyue through systematic destruction of their settlements. Captured tribesmen were used as front line fodder in the army. The remaining population was resettled in lowlands and many became tenant farmers for Chinese landowners.

===Vietnamese===
During the early phase of the Three Kingdoms era, there was a unrest across the Jiaozhi circuit (modern-day Guangdong, Guangxi and northern Vietnam) led by the Wuhu chief Liang Long and his rebellion attracted the Lac Viet and all other ethnic groups in Southern Han China, but was suppressed in 184. After a century and a half of close imperial supervision and repression, Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen enjoyed a period of autonomy from 187 to 226. In 177 Shi Xie became the prefect of Jiaozhi (Jiaozhou (modern Vietnam and Guangzhou)), is primarily remembered today in Vietnam as Sĩ Nhiếp, the father of education and a great patron of Buddhism. He relocated Jiaozhi’s capital back to Luy Lâu, the river market town Zhao Tuo had founded in 179 BC, which soon became celebrated for its trading prosperity. Shi Xie stayed out of the northern wars for the most part and later willingly submitted to Eastern Wu. According to Stephen O&#x27;Harrow, Shi Xie was essentially &quot;the first Vietnamese.&quot; Buddhism became the predominant religion the Lac people. During Shi Xie&#x27;s reign, the Lac people&#x27;s customs had been slightly altered and sinicized by Xie.

The south’s trade and treasure attracted imperial power. After Shi Xie’s death in 226, the Wu court at Nanjing reasserted direct Chinese control over Jiaozhi. An army of three thousand set out from Nanhai Commandery and sailed up the Red River. The Wu general summoned Xie’s son, Shi Hui, with his five brothers and sons, and beheaded them all. Having conquered Jiaozhi, Wu forces also stormed Jiuzhen, killing or capturing ten thousand people, along with surviving members of Shi Xie’s family In 231, the Wu court had to send another general to Jiuzhen to “exterminate and pacify the barbarous Yuè” there. In 248, the people of Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen commanderies rebelled. A Lạc Việt woman named Lady Triệu in Jiuzhen led a rebellion, followed by a hundred Lac chieftains led fifty thousand families in her revolt. Eastern Wu sent Lu Yin to deal with the rebels. He defeated her and put her to death.

In 255–56, the Vietnamese monk Đạo Thanh coauthored one of the first translations of the Mahayana sutra entitled The Saddharmapandarika (V. Pháp Hoa Tam Muội), or Lotus of Good Faith.

In 263, Viet &quot;barbarians&quot; people in Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen under Lã Hưng once again revolted against the Eastern Wu. The rebels handed the region over to Cao Wei (succeeded by the Jin dynasty in 266), which had recently conquered Shu Han. Wei sent former Shu officials and generals to govern the region, and in 268, they held off a large Wu counteroffensive. In 269, Wu launched another counteroffensive and eventually retook Jiaozhi’s ports and main towns by 271.

===Wuhuan===
The Wuhuan, a people similar to the Xianbei, were a loose confederation of nomads that had been subservient to larger and stronger neighboring powers for most of their existence. In 168 the Wuhuan established some degree of independence under their own leaders. The largest of these groups were led by Nanlou in Shanggu, Qiuliju in Liaoxi, Supuyan in the Dependent State of Liaodong, and Wuyan in Youbeiping. In 187 Qiuliju joined the rebellion of Zhang Chun. Following the defeat of Zhang Chun in 188, Qiuliju attacked Gongsun Zan but was defeated. In 190 he surrendered to Liu Yu and died in 193. Qiuliju&#x27;s son Louban was too young to succeed him so his cousin Tadun became acting guardian. In 195 Tadun, Nanlou and Supuyan supported Yuan Shao against Gongsun Zan. In 207 Tadun was defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain and died in battle. After their defeat many of the Wuhuan surrendered to Cao Cao and served as part of Cao Cao&#x27;s cavalry forces. Louban and Supuyan fled to Gongsun Kang, who killed them.

Cao Cao divided the Wuhuan into three groups situated in Dai Commandery. The chieftains Nengchendi and Pufulu continued to cause trouble until 218 when Cao Zhang destroyed the last remnants of their power for good. The Wuhuan gradually lost their cultural identity as they assimilated with the Han Chinese, Xianbei and other surrounding ethnic groups. Nonetheless, they continued to appear in history up to the end of the 4th century, albeit their name had become a term for generic or miscellaneous &quot;hu&quot; (雜胡; &quot;zahu&quot;) tribes with Donghu backgrounds.

===Wuqi===
The Wuqi &quot;Five Gorges&quot; barbarians were a mountain people who lived in Wuling Commandery. In 221, Liu Bei bribed their leader Shamoke into supporting his war against Sun Quan, however the invasion failed and Shamoke was killed in a counterattack by Lu Xun the following year.

===Xianbei===
The Xianbei killed the Northern Xiongnu chanyu Youliu in 87 and rose to power in the wake of the Northern Chanyu&#x27;s defeat by the Han at the Battle of the Altai Mountains in 89. By 156, the Xianbei were unified under a chieftain, Tanshihuai. Their loose confederacy lacked the organization of the Xiongnu but was highly aggressive until Tanshihuai&#x27;s death in 181. Tanshihuai&#x27;s son Helian lacked his father&#x27;s abilities and was killed in a raid on Beidi near the end of Emperor Ling of Han&#x27;s reign. Helian&#x27;s brother Kuitou succeeded him, but when Helian&#x27;s son Qianman came of age, he challenged his uncle to succession, destroying the last vestiges of unity among the Xianbei. By 190, the Xianbei had split into various groups, notably with Kuitou ruling in Inner Mongolia, Kebineng (軻比能) in northern Shanxi, and Suli (素利) and Mijia (彌加) in northern Liaodong. In 205, Kuitou&#x27;s brothers Budugen and Fuluohan succeeded him. After Cao Cao defeated the Wuhuan at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207, Budugen, Fuluohan and many other Xianbei chieftains paid tribute to him. In 218, Fuluohan met with the Wuhuan chieftain Nengchendi (能臣氐) to form an alliance, but Nengchendi double crossed him and called in Kebineng, who killed Fuluohan. Budugen went to the court of Cao Wei in 224 to ask for assistance against Kebineng, but he eventually betrayed them and allied with Kebineng in 233. Kebineng killed Budugen soon afterwards.

Kebineng was from a minor Xianbei tribe. He rose to power west of Dai Commandery by taking in a number of Chinese refugees, who helped him drill his soldiers and make weapons. After the defeat of the Wuhuan in 207, he also sent tribute to Cao Cao, and even provided assistance against the rebel Tian Yin. In 218 he allied himself to the Wuhuan rebel Nengchendi but they were heavily defeated and forced back across the frontier by Cao Zhang. In 220 he acknowledged Cao Pi as emperor of Cao Wei. Eventually he turned on the Wei for frustrating his advances on another Xianbei chieftain, Suli. Kebineng conducted raids on Cao Wei before he was killed in 235, after which his confederacy disintegrated.

The decline of the Wuhuan in the northeast encouraged the Xianbei tribes to move inwards and fill in the power vacuum, with some of them becoming vassals to the Wei and Jin courts. In 258, the Tuoba settled in the abandoned city of Shengle, north of the Yin Mountains. To the east of them, the Yuwen tribe settled between the Luan River and Liucheng, while the Murong tribe were allowed to move deeper into Liaodong after they assisted Sima Yi in his campaign against Gongsun Yuan in 238. Unlike the Xianbei of the steppe, the Duan was founded within the Chinese border by a Xianbei ex-slave of the Wuhuan, and rose to prominence in Liaoxi.

Other Xianbei tribes opted to migrate westward and settled around the Hexi Corridor. An offshoot of the Murong tribe moved into northern Qinghai and mixed with the native Qiang people, becoming known as the Tuyuhun, while the Qifu tribe settled around the Yellow River in the Longxi basin. A branch of the Tuoba, the Tufa tribe roamed the Hexi Corridor, and in 270, their chieftain, Tufa Shujineng, led a rebellion against the Jin dynasty with the Xianbei, Qiang, and other tribal peoples living in northwestern China. The rebels killed a handful of the generals sent to defeat them, and in 279, they were even able to capture Liang province. That year, Jin sent the general, Ma Long and finally quelled the rebellion in 280.

The Xianbei that migrated into China during this period went on to play an important role in Chinese history. They founded five of the short lived Sixteen Kingdoms: Former Yan (337–370), Later Yan (384–409), Western Qin (385–431), Southern Liang (397–414), and Southern Yan (398–410). They also established the Northern Wei (386–535), and the subsequent Northern Dynasties were all either founded by the Xianbei or heavily influenced by them.

===Xiongnu===
==== Southern Xiongnu ====
By the time of the Three Kingdoms period the Xiongnu had already ceased to be a major power. Due to infighting, the Xiongnu empire was divided into north and south in the 1st century; the northern branch, known as the Northern Xiongnu, had their last stand as a steppe empire in 89 when Dou Xian led an army of 45,000 and decisively defeated them at the Battle of the Altai Mountains. The southern branch, known as the Southern Xiongnu, continued to exist as a Han puppet state in Bing Province, where they served as auxiliaries to defend the frontiers. The Xiongnu Empire of the steppe was replaced by a loose confederation of disorganized Xianbei tribes, who were nonetheless highly aggressive and proved problematic to their southern neighbors. 

In 188, just as the situation in Luoyang was about to boil over, the Southern Xiongnu were also experiencing their own power struggle. The chanyu Qiangqu had been sending his tribesmen to aid the Han against the Yellow Turbans and Zhang Chun, and many among the Southern Xiongnu were alarmed by how frequent they were being mobilized. At the same time, the Xiuchuge people had rebelled against the Han in the Hetao region, invading Xihe Commandery and killing the Inspector of Bing. Thus, Southern Xiongnu rebels, led by the Xiluo clan of the Right Division, allied with the Xiuchuge and killed Qiangqu. When the Han court appointed his son Yufuluo to succeed him, the rebels refused to acknowledge his rule by expelling him and installing a marquis of the Xubu clan.

Yufuluo fled to the Han court but found no support after the death of Emperor Ling of Han in 189. When Yufuluo returned to Bing, he was denied entry by the rebels, so he acted as a wandering mercenary around Hedong Commandery, east of the Fen River while still claiming the title of chanyu. After he died in 195, his brother, Huchuquan succeeded him. Around this time, their uncle, Qubei notably provided military support for Emperor Xian of Han in his escape from Chang&#x27;an to Luoyang, and later escorted him to Cao Cao at Xuchang in 196. Huchuquan came to serve under Yuan Shang in 202 and was defeated by Cao Cao&#x27;s officer Zhong Yao, after which he surrendered.

Meanwhile, when the marquis of Xubu died in 189, his followers decided to retire the chanyu position and installed an elderly king as the nominal head of state. Among the rebel faction, the Xiuchuge, also known as the Chuge, were particular active in the conflict during the fall of Han. They became allies with the Heishan bandits of the Taihang Mountains before eventually retreating west as Cao Cao and Yuan Shao established their power in the north. The Xiuchuge were finally defeated at Gaoping County (高平縣; present-day Guyuan, Ningxia) by Cao Cao&#x27;s general, Xiahou Yuan, in 214.

==== Five Divisions ====
In 216, Cao Cao detained Huchuquan at Ye as an honoured prisoner. A number of commanderies in Bing province such as Shuofang and Yunzhong had to be abolished due to their remoteness and the hostile local tribes. Instead, Cao Cao had the last vestiges of the Southern Xiongnu rearranged into the Five Divisions and resettled them around Taiyuan Commandery, where they were supervised by Qubei. The nominal title of chanyu remained with Huchuquan until his death, after which no new chanyu was proclaimed. Under Qubei, the Five Divisions clashed with the migrating Tuoba-Xianbei to the north of them. After his death, his sons were initially not allowed to inherit his position.

During the Jiaping era (249–254), the Commander of the Left Division, Liu Bao unified the Five Divisions and was building up his military force. The Wei general, Deng Ai brought the matter to the court, who gradually redivided Liu Bao&#x27;s forces into five and had him send his son, Liu Yuan, as a hostage in Luoyang. Qubei&#x27;s son, Liu Meng was also given a honorary title among the Five Divisions and was stationed at Yanmen Pass. However, in 271, Liu Meng rebelled and left the Great Wall. He later returned to invade Bing, but was swiftly defeated and killed in early 272.

During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, Liu Yuan founded the Han-Zhao dynasty (304–329), while a line of Qubei&#x27;s descendants, the Tiefu clan, founded the Helian Xia dynasty (407–431). Shi Le, the founder of the Jie-led Later Zhao dynasty (319–351), descended from one of the Southern Xiongnu tribes, the Qiangqu (羌渠). The Northern Liang dynasty (397–439), whose ruling family were Lushuihu, is sometimes classed in historiography as a Xiongnu state.

<doc id="842153" wikidata="Q114391" url="?curid=842153" title="Congo red">
<text>Congo red is an organic compound, the sodium salt of 3,3′-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl)bis(4-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid). It is an azo dye. Congo red is water-soluble, yielding a red colloidal solution; its solubility is greater in organic solvents. The use of Congo red in the textile industry has long been abandoned, primarily because of its carcinogenic properties, but it is still used for histological staining.

== History ==
Congo red was first synthesized in 1883 by Paul Böttiger, who had been employed at Friedrich Bayer Company in Elberfeld, Germany. He was looking for textile dyes that did not require a mordant step. The company which had a right of first refusal to his inventions was not interested in this bright red color, so he filed the patent under his own name and sold it to the AGFA company of Berlin. AGFA marketed the dye under the name &quot;Congo red&quot;, a catchy name in Germany at the time of the 1884 Berlin West Africa Conference, an important event in the Colonisation of Africa. The dye was a major commercial success for AGFA. In the following years, for the same reason, other dyes were marketed using the &quot;Congo&quot; name: Congo rubine, Congo corinth, brilliant Congo, Congo orange, Congo brown, and Congo blue. Once of economic significance, Congo red has fallen into disuse as have all benzidine-derived dyes, owing to their carcinogenic activity. 

It is prepared by azo coupling of the bis(diazonium) derivative of benzidine with naphthionic acid.

Congo blue, however, is in widespread international use, in gel sheet form, as a filter to place in front of theatrical, motion picture, television, church, and live event lighting instruments. It is sold under the item name &quot;181 Congo Blue&quot; by Lee Filters. It emits a deep rich saturated blue color with elements of red. Depending upon the color temperature of the source lamp, the light from a lighting instrument with a Congo Blue filter reflected from a white surface can vary from very saturated blue to purple or violet. The manufacturer reports that fluorescent light through a Congo Blue filter gives the appearance of black light. Congo Blue filters are frequently used at live music concerts at an angle from behind musicians to cross back-light with a &quot;warm&quot; color gel like yellow, straw, gold, orange, or magenta, from an opposing angle, for a very dramatic effect. Another use of Congo Blue filters by lighting technicians, is to cut a small strip from the gel sheet, which the technician looks through to make brightness adjustments to a video monitor displaying a standard color bar chart. The Congo Blue filter effectively removes the color from chart and shows the separate bars only in terms of their differing incremental brightness levels. This allows the technician to adjust the monitor to show a full and correct range of brightnesses.
== Behavior in solution ==

Due to a color change from blue to red at pH 3.0–5.2, Congo red can be used as a pH indicator. Since this color change is an approximate inverse of that of litmus, it can be used with litmus paper in a simple parlor trick: add a drop or two of Congo red to both an acid solution and a base solution. Dipping red litmus paper in the red solution will turn it blue, while dipping blue litmus paper in the blue solution will turn it red. This property gives Congo red a metachromatic property as a dye, both in strongly acidic solutions and with strongly acidophilic tissue.

Congo red has a propensity to aggregate in aqueous and organic solutions. The proposed mechanisms suggest hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic rings of the dye molecules, leading to a π–π stacking phenomenon. Although these aggregates are present under various sizes and shapes, the &quot;ribbon-like micelles&quot; of a few molecules seem to be the predominant form (even if the &quot;micelle&quot; term is not an entirely appropriate name for it). This aggregation phenomenon is more prevalent in high Congo red concentrations, at high salinity and/or low pH.

== Diagnostic use ==

In histology and microscopy, Congo red is used for staining in amyloidosis, and for the cell walls of plants and fungi, and for the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Apple-green birefringence of Congo red stained preparations under polarized light is indicative of the presence of amyloid fibrils. Additionally, Congo red is used for the diagnostics of the &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot; serotype 2a, where the dye binds the bacterium&#x27;s unique lipopolysaccharide structure.
Furthermore, Congo red may also be used to induce expression of the type III secretion system of &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot;, bringing about the secretion of IpaB and IpaC, which form translocation pores within host cell membrane, allowing effector proteins to pass through and alter the host cell&#x27;s biochemistry. The dye can also be used in flow cytometry experiments for the detection of &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;, &quot;Naegleria&quot; and other amoebal cysts.
In confocal microscopy, Congo red can be used as a stable fluorescent stain.

<text>Skulker was an ARIA Award-nominated rock band from Sydney that formed in 1994. After two albums, the group parted ways in 2005.

==History==
The group&#x27;s original members met at Cheltenham Girls High School in northern Sydney in 1994 and decided to form a band. The original line-up consisted of Greer Skinner on lead vocals and guitar, Annette Harada on bass guitar, Naomi &quot;Batti&quot; Battah on guitar and occasional lead vocals and drummer Angela Blackshaw.

After an initial period establishing itself on the Sydney live circuit the band came to the attention of independent label Chatterbox Records and in 2000 Skulker released the album &quot;Too Fat for Tahiti&quot;. The title was apparently inspired by the band being rejected for a gig as a house band at a resort in Tahiti because they were &quot;too fat&quot;.

&quot;Too Fat for Tahiti&quot; spawned the singles &quot;Hëj&quot; and &quot;Naughty&quot; which received considerable support from the national youth radio station Triple J and both were voted into the network&#x27;s annual listeners&#x27; poll, the Triple J Hottest 100, 2000, at number 50 and 80 respectively. The album was subsequently nominated for ARIA Award for Best Independent Release and Best New Live Act at the Australian Music Awards.

In 2003, the band released their second studio album, &quot;The Double Life&quot;.
A free download-only single &quot;Rock Nugget&quot; was released. It was downloaded over 20,000 times and received high rotation on Triple J.
The band also played alongside one of their major music influences, Veruca Salt, in Sydney&#x27;s The Metro Theatre in July that year. The band released the singles &quot;Coming Home&quot; and &quot;In Your Arms&quot; and played the Big Day Out tour in 2004. Early 2004 also found the band opening for Pink in Sydney and Newcastle and touring nationally supporting The Superjesus.

At this point Batti decided to depart the band and moved to Canada to pursue other interests. Following the replacement of Batti with new guitarist Gregory Boulting, Skulker toured the east coast of Australia and recorded extensive demos of new material that have never been released. The band members have since decided to go their own ways and pursue further interests.

<text>William Wilson DL (28 June 1913 – 18 August 2010), was a British Labour Party politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for constituencies in Coventry from 1964 to 1983. He was the chairman of the British-Soviet Friendship Society from 1977 to 1983.

Wilson was educated at Coventry Technical College and Birmingham University. He served in the British Army during World War II in North Africa, Italy and Greece, rising to the rank of sergeant. After the war he qualified as a solicitor and made several unsuccessful attempts to win the Warwick and Leamington constituency in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959, before being successful in 1964 in Coventry South, which he represented (later as Coventry South East) until retiring from Parliament in 1983. He also was a Warwickshire County Councillor from 1958, being leader of the Labour Group in the 1960s and from 1972 to 1993.

Wilson was responsible for piloting the Divorce Reform Act 1969 through Parliament which changed the basis for divorce procedures from the old concept of matrimonial offences to that of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

<text>The is a large mountain ridge in the Scottish Highlands, marking the northern edge of Glen Coe. It stretches east–west for several miles and includes two Munro summits: Sgùrr nam Fiannaidh at 967 m (3,175 ft) high, and Meall Dearg at 952 m (3,124 ft) high. The ridge is very rocky and the route along it requires scrambling ability. The slopes to each side are extremely dangerous, with steep grass-and-scree slopes hiding even steeper slopes which end in cliffs on both north and south sides of the ridge.

==Climbing==

The Aonach Eagach is usually regarded as the most difficult horizontal &#x27;scrambling&#x27; ridge in mainland Scotland, though it vies with Liathach (and, in winter, An Teallach) for this title. In his book &quot;Scrambles in Lochaber&quot;, local climber Noel Williams warns that there are no other ridges in the area that are &quot;so narrow and so difficult to escape from once committed. Some sections are extremely exposed. This makes it a difficult outing to grade, because the technical difficulties are not great&quot;. Williams settled on grade 2, implying it is easier than the (optional) grade 2/3 approach scramble up A&#x27;Chailleach, but added a further warning (in bold type) that &quot;there are no safe descents on the south side of the ridge&quot;.

The Aonach Eagach is normally tackled from the Glen Coe (south) side in an east–west traverse. The best parking for this scrambling route is located just off the A82 at grid reference NN 17335674. From Allt-na-reigh near the head of Glen Coe a good path ascends Am Bodach (a subsidiary Munro top) and continues westwards along the ridge to the first Munro proper, Meall Dearg.

From here the summit of Sgorr nam Fiannaidh lies only two kilometres to the west, but a number of pinnacles must be scrambled over, and it is not uncommon for parties to take more than two hours to cross this short distance. There are a couple of sections where the use of a rope may prove prudent.

In winter, the ridge is a fine expedition, though considerably harder than in summer (Scottish Winter Grade I/II), and many parties will go roped for some sections. Because of the short winter days, benightment on the ridge or its approaches is also not infrequent.

Competent summer scramblers have plenty of time to reverse the ridge and descend Am Bodach, saving a walk back up the glen.

From Sgorr nam Fiannaidh, the most direct descent is to head south by southwest, down a steep zig-zag path leading by the side of Clachaig gully. This &#x27;path&#x27; is exceptionally steep and extremely loose in places, and has many small rock steps; it approaches close to the main gully in several places and so is potentially dangerous (fatal accidents have occurred here). A gentler alternative is to continue along the ridge, until reaching the bealach between Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and the Pap of Glencoe. From here a track heads down the hillside, ending on the road just outside Glencoe village. It is also possible to retreat approximately 200 m east from the summit of Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and descend directly down the scree slope to Loch Achtriochtan, taking care to avoid being drawn into gullies further down. This descent also requires care, particularly near the top, but is still far safer than the Clachaig Gully descent.

Alternatively, the two Munros may be climbed individually by simply descending by the route of ascent. However it is for the traverse that the Aonach Eagach is best known.

=== Incidents ===
Hill walkers are urged to use caution when attempting Aonach Eagach, and fatalities on the route are not unknown.

* In summer 2009, two experienced hill walkers were fatally injured in separate incidents after falling into the Clachaig Gully along the ridge.
* In September 2014, experienced hill walker Lisa MacDermid fell nearly 492 while hiking the ridge when she was fatally injured.
* In July 2016, a hill walker from Aberdeen fell while walking the Aonach Eagach ridge.
* In August 2017, experienced fell runner Stuart Thompson fell 20 to 30m to his death in the Clachaig Gully on the western end on Aonach Eagach.
* In 2022, a body found in the Clachaig Gully was confirmed to be 57-year-old Alan Taylor who went missing from the Dundee area in September 2021.
* In August 2023, two climbers and their mountain guide were killed while attempting to traverse Aonach Eagach.

==Devil&#x27;s Staircase==
A path known as the Devil&#x27;s Staircase crosses the range about 6 km east of Meall Dearg. Today, as part of the West Highland Way, it is used primarily by walkers and mountain bikers travelling between Kinlochleven and Glencoe.

The Devil&#x27;s Staircase was given its name by the soldiers who were part of the road building programme of General Wade, because of the difficulties of carrying building materials up that stretch of the road. Later, however, the road lived up to its name when workers building the Blackwater Dam chose to travel to the Kings House Hotel after they had been paid, rather than walking down to Kinlochleven. The journey to the pub often proved to be more difficult than they realised and on the return trip, after a few drinks on a cold winter&#x27;s night, the devil often &quot;claimed his own&quot;.

In 1692, the path was the approach route for the (apparently delayed) troops coming from Kinlochleven to provide reinforcements for the Massacre of Glencoe.

<text>Marion Ross (born Marian Ellen Ross; October 25, 1928) is an American actress. Her best-known role is that of Marion Cunningham on the ABC television sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, on which she starred from 1974 to 1984 and for which she received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Before her success on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Ross appeared in a variety of film roles, appearing in &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954), &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958), &quot;Some Came Running&quot; (1958), &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959), and &quot;Honky&quot; (1971), as well as several minor television roles, one of which was on television&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (1954). She was also twice nominated successively in 1992 and 1993 for the Primetime Emmy Award for her performance on the CBS television comedy-drama &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; and later netted another Emmy nomination (her fifth and last) in 1999 for a two-episode appearance on the popular CBS drama &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. Ross also starred in the high-profile, long-anticipated sequel to &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), &quot;The Evening Star&quot; (1996), in a turn for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, as well as both a nomination and win for a Lone Star Film and Television Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Since the 1990s, Ross has been known for voice-over work on animated television series, including &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, among others, and recurring roles on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; and guest appearances.

==Early life==
Marian Ellen Ross was born on October 25, 1928 in Watertown, Carver County, Minnesota, the middle child of Gordon and Ellen Alicia (née Hamilton) Ross, natives of Saskatchewan, Canada. She had an elder sister, Alicia, and a younger brother, Gordon. She lived in Waconia, then moved to Willmar, and eventually to Albert Lea, Minnesota.

At the age of 13, she changed the spelling of her name from &quot;Marian&quot; to &quot;Marion&quot;, as she thought it had a &quot;more pleasing appearance&quot; and would look better on a theatrical program and a theater&#x27;s marquee. After completing her sophomore year in high school, she moved to Minneapolis, studying drama at the MacPhail Center for Music and attending Southwest High School. A year later, her family moved to San Diego, California when she was 16 years old. She graduated from Point Loma High School in San Diego. She earned her undergraduate degree from San Diego State University.

==Career==

===Early film and television roles: 1953–1973===
Ross made her 1953 film debut in &quot;Forever Female&quot;, starring Ginger Rogers and William Holden. She found steady work in film, appearing in &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954), &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), &quot;Lizzie&quot; (1957), &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958), &quot;Some Came Running&quot; (1958), and &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959). She also appeared in &quot;&quot; (1970), &quot;Honky&quot; (1971), and &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (1977).

Ross&#x27; career on television also began in 1953, when she played the Irish maid on the series &quot;Life with Father&quot; for two years. In 1954, she appeared as Ginny Thorpe on &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, and in 1958, she appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot; as Mary Williams. In 1959, she appeared as a teacher Miss McGinnis on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. She appeared on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot; (1956 episode), &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason (The Case of the Romantic Rogue)&quot;, &quot;Buckskin&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (The Special One), &quot;Thriller (U.S. TV series)&quot; (The Prisoner in the Mirror), &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot; (two episodes as Diane Warren), &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;Night Court&quot;.

In the 1961–62 television season, she played Gertrude Berg&#x27;s daughter on the CBS sitcom &quot;Mrs. G. Goes to College&quot; as well as starred as a mail order bride on &quot;Rawhide&quot;. Ross had an uncredited and non-speaking role as one of the hapless passengers on board Trans Global Flight #2 in &quot;Airport&quot; (1970). In 1970, she also played a computer scientist in the sci-fi thriller &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Happy Days&quot; success and roles thereafter: 1974–1995===

Ross&#x27; best known role is on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, which aired for 11 seasons on ABC, from 1974 to 1984, having to appear in almost every episode of the series, with the exception of 2. She portrayed matriarch Marion Cunningham, mother of Richie, Joanie, and (briefly) Chuck. She received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for her work on the show in 1979 and 1984. Ross later reprised Marion Cunningham on the spin-off series &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot; and on &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Between 1978 and 1986, she appeared as different characters on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In the final (#9) 1986–87 television season, Ross became a series regular, playing Emily Haywood, who was the love interest of Captain Stubing, played by Gavin MacLeod. She later starred in the short-lived, critically acclaimed comedy-drama &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1991 to 1993. The series won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award following its first season. Ross also appeared on the game show &quot;Password Plus&quot; in 1979.

===Recent roles: 1996–2021===

In 1996, Ross starred as housekeeper Rosie Dunlop (played originally by Betty R. King in the preceding 1983 film), opposite Shirley MacLaine in &quot;The Evening Star&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;. Despite panning the film, New York Times critic Janet Maslin enthused that, &quot;Marion Ross does a warm, sturdy job as the devoted housekeeper who has been kept too long under Aurora&#x27;s wing.&quot; She was nominated for a 1997 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, as well as going on to win the 1997 Lone Star Film and Television Award for Best Supporting Actress for that very same turn.

Ross had a recurring role on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; as a homeless woman and was in the final two episodes of the series. Additionally, she played a secretly ill mother in &quot;The Cat&quot;, an episode of &quot;Early Edition&quot; that first aired in April 1997. She had recurring roles as Drew Carey&#x27;s mother on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; (during one episode of which she was referred to as her &quot;Happy Days&quot; character Mrs. Cunningham, a deliberate error for a contest the show was running); as mean grandmother Bernice Forman on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;; and as Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore and Marilyn Gilmore on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. She also frequently appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. During the 1990s, Ross became active in voice-over work. She voiced Grandma SquarePants on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and Mrs. Lopart on &quot;Handy Manny&quot;. She also guest-starred on &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;Generator Rex&quot;, and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

In 2007, Ross appeared in &quot;Music Within&quot;. In 2007 and 2010, she played Ida Holden on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;. In June 2008, the Albert Lea Civic Theater in Albert Lea, Minnesota, changed its name to the Marion Ross Performing Arts Center. That year, Ross played Aunt Lucille in the film &quot;Superhero Movie&quot;, and in 2009 she appeared in a guest spot on &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;.

In 2010, Ross guest-starred on &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and appeared in the Cartoon Network television film &quot;Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster&quot; as Mrs. Trowburg. In 2013, she guest-starred on both &quot;Major Crimes&quot; and &quot;The Middle&quot;, and in 2014 on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. In September 2015, she began making brief appearances on MeTV to share her memories of her &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-stars. In 2020, Ross played Mrs. Genzinger in the Hallmark Christmas television movie &quot;Signed Sealed Delivered For Christmas&quot;. In 2021, Ross retired from acting, but continued to make several small appearances in various online projects. In 2024, she returned to &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, reprising her role as Grandma SquarePants in the season 14 episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Laugh&quot;.

==&quot;Happy Days&quot; lawsuit==
In April 2011, Ross learned of a &quot;Happy Days&quot;-themed casino machine that used her image. In response, she, Erin Moran, Don Most, Anson Williams, and the estate of Tom Bosley filed a $10 million lawsuit against Paramount, claiming they had not been paid for merchandising revenue. In July 2012, the lawsuit was settled, with each actor receiving a payment of $65,000 and CBS promising to honor the terms of their contracts.

<text>Françoise Paulette Louise Dorléac (; 21 March 194226 June 1967) was a French actress. She was the elder sister of Catherine Deneuve, with whom she starred in the 1967 musical, &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot;. Her other films include Philippe de Broca&#x27;s movie &quot;That Man from Rio&quot;, François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Soft Skin&quot;, Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;, and Val Guest&#x27;s &quot;Where the Spies Are&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early films===
Dorléac was the daughter of screen actors Maurice Dorléac and Renée Simonot. Slim, fair and blonde, she modeled for Dior and then made her film debut in &quot;The Wolves in the Sheepfold&quot; (1960), directed by Hervé Bromberger. She went on to appear in &quot;The Door Slams&quot; (1960) with Dany Saval and her sister Catherine Deneuve. Dorléac had a small role in &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; (1961) with Anna Karina for director Michel Deville, &quot;The Girl with the Golden Eyes&quot; (1961) with Marie Laforêt, &quot;All the Gold in the World&quot; (1961) with Bourvil, and &quot;Adorable Liar&quot; (1961) from director Deville.

Dorléac was Jean-Pierre Cassel&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;The Dance&quot; (1962) and had one of the leads in a TV movie, &quot;Les trois chapeaux claques&quot; (1962), directed by Jean-Pierre Marchand.

She was reunited with Cassel in &quot;&quot; (1962) and was one of many stars of the television movie &quot;Teuf-teuf&quot; (1963).

===French stardom===
Dorléac leapt to international stardom with the female lead in &quot;That Man from Rio&quot; (1964) starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and directed by Philippe de Broca. She followed it with &quot;The Soft Skin&quot; (1964) directed by François Truffaut.

She was in &quot;The Gentle Art of Seduction&quot; (1964) with Belmondo and Jean-Paul Brialy, with her sister in a support part. Dorléac was one of several French stars in &quot;Circle of Love&quot; (1964) directed by Roger Vadim, and appeared in a TV show, &quot;Les petites demoiselles&quot; (1964), directed by Deville and starring De Broca. She also appeared in the comedy films, &quot;Arsène Lupin contre Arsène Lupin&quot; (1962) opposite Jean-Claude Brialy, and &quot;Male Hunt&quot; (1964), with Belmondo and her sister.

===International career===

&quot;That Man from Rio&quot; and &quot;Soft Skin&quot; were seen widely internationally and Dorléac received an offer to play the female lead in an expensive Hollywood financed epic, &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1965). She was David Niven&#x27;s love interest in a spy film at MGM, &quot;Where the Spies Are&quot; (1966).

Dorléac appeared as the adulterous wife in Roman Polanski&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966), shot in Britain. She returned to France to star in a TV adaption of the Prosper Mérimée novel &quot;Julie de Chaverny ou la Double Méprise&quot; (1966) directed by Marchand. Then she joined Gene Kelly and her sister Catherine, who was a cinematic star by this time, playing starstruck singing twins in &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967), an homage to Hollywood musicals.

Her final film role was the female lead in &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967) opposite Michael Caine, who played spy Harry Palmer.

==Private life==
Dorléac&#x27;s parents were protective of her and her siblings, and well into adulthood she shared a bunk bed with her sister Catherine Deneuve in the family home, to which she regularly returned, according to Roger Vadim.

In December 1960, she met future co-star Jean-Pierre Cassel at the Épi-Club, a fashionable Montparnasse nightclub where she danced and partied with her younger sister, who also met Vadim there through mutual acquaintances. Cassel wrote in his 2004 autobiography that Dorléac had been the &quot;love of his youth.”

She was briefly the companion of François Truffaut in 1964, during and after the filming of the film &quot;La Peau Douce.&quot; This affair quickly turned into a friendship between the actress and the director, who affectionately called her “Raspberry.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Libération&quot;, Guy Bedos, who also appears in &quot;Ce Soir ou Jamais&quot; by Michel Deville, evokes his missing relatives and significant others including her: &quot;I had a fiancée, Françoise Dorléac. Since her death, I can no longer pass in front of the Louvre without seeing her.”

Later she lived in an apartment at 159, boulevard Murat, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, just opposite the building where she grew up and where her parents lived.

==Death==
Dorléac was on the brink of international stardom when she died in a traffic accident on 26 June 1967, aged 25. She lost control of her rented Renault 10 and hit a signpost ten kilometres from Nice at the Villeneuve-Loubet exit of the autoroute La Provençale. The car flipped over in a field and burst into flames. Dorléac had been en route to Nice Airport after vacationing with Deneuve at Saint-Tropez and was afraid of missing her flight. She was pinned under the steering wheel and was seen struggling to get out of the car, but was unable to unbuckle her seat belt and open the door. Police later identified her body only from the fragment of a cheque book, a diary, and her driver&#x27;s licence.

<text>Shafrira Goldwasser (; born 1959) is an Israeli-American computer scientist. A winner of the Turing Award in 2012, she is the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; a professor of mathematical sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science; the director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California, Berkeley; and co-founder and chief scientist of Duality Technologies.

==Education and early life==
Born in New York City, Goldwasser obtained her bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1979 in mathematics and science from Carnegie Mellon. She continued her studies in computer science at Berkeley, receiving a master&#x27;s degree in 1981 and a PhD in 1984. While at Berkeley, she and her doctoral advisor, Manuel Blum, would propose the Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem.

==Career and research==
Goldwasser joined MIT in 1983, and in 1997 became the first holder of the RSA Professorship. She became a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science, concurrent to her professorship at MIT, in 1993. She is a member of the theory of computation group at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In 2005, Goldwasser was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to cryptography, number theory, and complexity theory, and their applications to privacy and security, and in 2006, Berkeley awarded her its Computer Science Distinguished Alumni Award.

Goldwasser was a co-recipient of the 2012 Turing Award for &quot;revolutionizing the science of cryptography&quot;.

Since November 2016, Goldwasser has been the chief scientist and co-founder of Duality Technologies, a US-based start-up which offers secure data analytics using advanced cryptographic techniques. She is also a scientific advisor for several technology startups in the security area, including QED-it, specializing in the Zero Knowledge Blockchain, and Algorand, a pure proof-of-stake blockchain.

On January 1, 2018, she became the director of Berkeley&#x27;s Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing.

Goldwasser&#x27;s research areas include computational complexity theory, cryptography and computational number theory. 
She is the co-inventor of probabilistic encryption, which set up and achieved the gold standard for security for data encryption.

Goldwasser is a co-inventor of zero-knowledge proofs, which probabilistically and interactively demonstrate the validity of an assertion without conveying any additional knowledge, and are a key tool in the design of cryptographic protocols. Her work in complexity theory includes the classification of approximation problems, showing that some problems in NP remain hard even when only an approximate solution is needed, and pioneering methods for delegating computations to untrusted servers. Her work in number theory includes the invention with Joe Kilian of primality proving using elliptic curves. Goldwasser is also a lead on Project CETI, an interdisciplinary initiative for translating the communication of sperm whales.

===Awards and honors===
Goldwasser was awarded the 2012 Turing Award along with Silvio Micali for their work in the field of cryptography.

Goldwasser has twice won the Gödel Prize in theoretical computer science: first in 1993 (for &quot;The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems&quot;), and again in 2001 (for &quot;Interactive Proofs and the Hardness of Approximating Cliques&quot;). Other awards include the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award (1996) for outstanding young computer professional of the year and the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics (1998) for outstanding mathematical contributions to cryptography. In 2001 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 2002 she gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing. In 2004 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2005 to the National Academy of Engineering. She was selected as an IACR Fellow in 2007. Goldwasser received the 2008–2009 Athena Lecturer Award of the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s Committee on Women in Computing. She is the recipient of The Franklin Institute&#x27;s 2010 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science. She received the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award in 2011.
She received the 2018 Frontier of Knowledge award together with Micali, Rivest and Shamir.

Goldwasser was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2017. In July 2017, she was a plenary lecturer in the Mathematical Congress of the Americas.

In 2018, Goldwasser was awarded an honorary degree by her alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University. In June 2019 Goldwasser was awarded an honorary doctorate of science by the University of Oxford.

Goldwasser is featured in the Notable Women in Computing cards. She won the Suffrage Science award in 2016. She was on the Mathematical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2020. She was awarded the 2021 L’Oréal-UNESCO for Women in Science Award in Computer Science.

==Personal life==
Goldwasser is married to fellow computer scientist Nir Shavit, with whom she has two sons.

<text>José Maria Ferreira de Castro (24 May 1898 – 29 June 1974) was a Portuguese writer and journalist. Ferreira de Castro had a long career in journalism, and considered his fiction writing to be an extension of his documentary reporting; in that regard, he is considered to be one of the fathers of contemporary Portuguese social-realist (or neorealist) fiction, a forerunner of socially committed literature about the rural and working classes later further established by Alves Redol, and more than once a nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Ferreira de Castro was part of the group of noted public intellectuals that were opposed to the authoritarian &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime; despite his participation in almost every peaceful action directed against the regime, his national and international recognition as an acclaimed novelist meant he was never a victim of excessively violent repression, such as prison, torture or loss of political rights.

==Life==
The eldest son of José Eustáquio Ferreira de Castro, a poor peasant, and Maria Rosa Soares de Castro, he lost his father at the age of 8. At 12 years old, he decided to emigrate with the intention of supporting his family. On January 7, 1911, he embarked on the steamship &quot;Jerôme&quot; bound for Belém do Pará, in Brazil. There, he would publish his first novel, &quot;Criminoso por Ambição&quot;, in 1916.

Later, for four years, he lived in the rubber plantation of Paraíso, in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, on the banks of the Madeira River. After leaving Paraíso, he lived in precarious conditions, having to resort to jobs such as pasting posters, or as a deckhand on Amazonian ships.

Later, in Portugal, he was editor of the newspaper &quot;O Século&quot;, director of the newspaper &quot;O Diabo&quot; and contributor to the magazines &quot;O Domingo Ilustrado&quot; (1925-1927), &quot;Renovação&quot; (1925-1926), and &quot;Ilustração&quot; (started in 1926). While working for &quot;O Século&quot; he penned vibrant chronicles, such as his purposeful arrest in Limoeiro Jail to witness the lives of prisoners in Portuguese prisons, or his exclusive Dublin interview of Éamon de Valera, leader of Sinn Fein, in 1930.

In 1930, he published &quot;A Selva&quot;, the work that earned him recognition on an international level, including his nomination to the Nobel Prize in Literature. The book received positive reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, introduced him to Hollywood and allowed him to join the French Pen Club. At that time, his wife, Diana de Liz, died. The novel is dedicated to her.

After the death of his wife, Ferreira de Castro left for England by boat, in the company of the writer Assis Esperança. He fell ill, diagnosed with sepsis, but was treated by the doctor and art historian Reynaldo dos Santos. As a result of his profound state of mourning, in December 1931, Ferreira de Castro unsuccessfully attempted suicide. He travelled to Madeira for his convalescence, where he wrote the novel &quot;Eternidade&quot; (1933), on the theme of the obsession with death.

He was also famous for his travel literature, namely his book &quot;A Volta ao Mundo&quot;, recounting his travels around the world in the outset of World War II.
==Death==
He suffered a stroke and died shortly after the Carnation Revolution, which he welcomed enthusiastically, having marched on the historic first demonstrations of the International Workers&#x27; Day the week that followed the revolution. His remains were buried, following his express wishes, on the Sintra Mountains, by a winding lane that goes up to the Castle of the Moors.

The Ferreira de Castro Museum is in Sintra, where he wrote many of his novels.

<doc id="842181" wikidata="Q282837" url="?curid=842181" title="Strigil">
<text>The strigil (Latin: strigilis) or stlengis (, probably a loanword from the Pre-Greek substrate) is a tool for the cleansing of the body by scraping off dirt, perspiration, and oil that was applied before bathing in Ancient Greek and Roman cultures. In these cultures the strigil was primarily used by men, specifically male athletes; however, in Etruscan culture there is evidence of strigils being used by both sexes. The standard design is a curved blade with a handle, all of which is made of metal.

Strigils were commonly used by individuals who were engaging in vigorous activities, in which they accumulated large amounts of dirt and sweat on their bodies. The people who used the strigil included athletes, the wealthy, soldiers, and more. However, wealthy or prestigious individuals often had slaves to wield the strigils and clean their bodies, rather than doing it themselves.

Strigils were not only significant in a practical sense, but culturally as well. They are often found in tombs or burials, in some cases along with a bottle of oil.

==Representations==

===Timeline===
Strigils were not used in the earlier ages of Greek history. This is supported by Homer’s poems, which state that oil was applied after bathing and was not removed. Furthermore, strigils are not mentioned in literature until the later portion of the fifth century BC. As early as the sixth century BC, however, representations of strigils can be found on vases. By the fourth century BC, strigils are depicted in other types of artwork, such as skyphoi and statues. 

In Book 23 of the Iliad, during the funeral games for Patroclus, Homer describes the athletes using strigils to clean themselves after physical contests. This is one of the earliest literary references to the strigil in Greek culture, illustrating its use in the context of athletic events, which were an important part of Greek social and religious life.
Implications for the Timeline
Strigil in the Iliad: The mention of the strigil in the Iliad suggests that the tool was already in use during the time period that Homer describes (the Mycenaean period, if we follow traditional dating). However, since the Iliad was composed much later, it reflects the practices and cultural elements of Homer&#x27;s own time (the 8th century BC), not necessarily the exact customs of the Bronze Age Greeks.

Cultural Continuity: The use of the strigil in the Iliad indicates that this tool was part of a long-standing tradition in Greek culture, dating back to at least the early 1st millennium BC, if not earlier. This continuity also explains how the practice could be transmitted to the Etruscans during their period of close interaction with the Greeks.

===Cultural depictions===
As stated above, strigils are represented throughout Greek, Roman, and Etruscan cultures in varying ways. Strigils were often depicted alongside olive oil and an athlete. The Croatian Apoxyomenos is a statue that displays the use of a strigil by an athlete. Strigils were also represented on some sarcophagi, such as the marble strigil sarcophagus of a Greek physician, which has elaborate S-shaped curves on it to symbolize strigils.

One source offers an alternative portrayal of strigils, &quot;a secondary meaning for the word stlengis, strigil, is wreath or tiara.&quot; To support the claim that a strigil may have been viewed as a tiara or wreath, there was a fifth-century grave that had a strigil across the forehead of a corpse.

====Burials and tombs====

Strigils were significant beyond merely being tools for cleansing; they were also a common offering given to the deceased during burial. For instance, three graves from Greece in the third century BC, which contained adult males, all had iron strigils. 

In the excavation of another third century BC tomb, which contained an Etruscan woman, there was an inscribed silver strigil along with a mirror. Strigils were commonly found in the tombs of Etruscan women, and it seemed to be an essential part of women’s bathing equipment. The inscribed silver strigil of the Etruscan tomb has two inscriptions on the handle: One being śuthina, an inscription found on numerous objects in the tomb. While the other, more significant inscription is a monogram, R:M, which reads as Ra:Mu. The monogram is speculated to be the beginning of the Etruscan woman’s name.

In 2018, archaeologists discovered in Assos many strigils. Some of the strigils found were iron, but most were made of bronze.

===Composition and design===
As is obvious from the strigils found in the previously discussed tombs, strigils could differ in the type of metal used, design, etc., depending on the status of the individual it belonged to, time period, and other relevant factors. The typical metals used for strigils were bronze and iron.
Some other variations of strigils are as follows: Hippias, an ancient Greek sophist who created his own strigil, made it in a unique way which allowed for sweat to drain through a small channel. Literature from Plutarch states that Spartans used reeds at times instead of the typical metal strigils.

<doc id="842182" wikidata="Q192486" url="?curid=842182" title="Kings of Leon">
<text>Kings of Leon is an American rock band formed in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, in 1999. The band includes brothers Caleb, Nathan, and Jared Followill and their cousin Matthew Followill.

The band&#x27;s early music was a blend of Southern rock and garage rock with blues influences, but it has evolved throughout the years to include a variety of music genres and a more alternative rock-based sound. Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine top 40 singles and two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band&#x27;s albums at the time peaked in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, &quot;Because of the Times&quot;, reached No. 1.

After the release of &quot;Only by the Night&quot; in September 2008, the band achieved chart success in the United States. The singles &quot;Sex on Fire&quot;, &quot;Use Somebody&quot;, and &quot;Notion&quot; all peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album was their first platinum-selling album in the United States, and the best-selling album of 2008 in Australia, being certified platinum nine times. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Come Around Sundown&quot;, was released on October 18, 2010. Their sixth album, &quot;Mechanical Bull&quot;, was released on September 24, 2013. The seventh studio album, &quot;Walls&quot;, was released on October 14, 2016. Their eighth studio album, &quot;When You See Yourself&quot;, was released on March 5, 2021. Their ninth studio album, &quot;Can We Please Have Fun&quot;, was released on May 10, 2024. The group has won 4 Grammy Awards from 12 nominations, including Record of the Year for &quot;Use Somebody&quot; in 2010.

==History==
===Early years: 1999–2002===
The three Followill brothers (Matthew is their cousin) grew up in Oklahoma and Tennessee with their father, Ivan Leon Followill, a United Pentecostal Church preacher, and their mother, Betty-Ann. Nathan was born in Oklahoma, and Jared and Caleb were born in and around Memphis, Tennessee. Jared attended Mount Juliet High School, while Matthew was born and raised in Mississippi. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;While Ivan preached at churches and tent revivals throughout Oklahoma and the Deep South, his boys attended services and were occasionally enlisted to &quot;bang on some drums&quot;. They were either home-schooled by their mother, or enrolled in small parochial schools at this time. Except for a five-year period when they settled in Jackson, Tennessee, the Followills&#x27; childhoods were spent driving through the southern United States in a purple 1988 Oldsmobile, camping for a week or two wherever Ivan was scheduled to preach.

When the boys&#x27; father resigned from preaching and their parents divorced in 1997, Nathan and Caleb relocated to outside Nashville and originally embraced country music. While there, they met songwriter Angelo Petraglia, who helped the siblings hone their songwriting skills and introduced them to the musical influences of Thin Lizzy, the Rolling Stones and the Clash in particular. Jared, who had briefly attended public school, was more influenced by the music of the Pixies and the Velvet Underground. When he and their cousin Matthew also moved to Nashville in 1999, Kings of Leon was formed. They named the band after their grandfather Leon, who died in January 2014. The band stated during a concert in Dublin in 2017 that they had done a DNA test and were found to be 25% Irish.

===Signing and first EP: 2002–2003===
By 2002, Nathan and Caleb had received interest from a number of music labels and eventually signed with RCA Records, which initially insisted on putting a band together for the two of them. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, however, Nathan outlined how they told RCA, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to be Evan and Jaron. We&#x27;re going to buy our little brother a bass, he&#x27;s a freshman in high school. Caleb will teach himself the guitar, Matthew played guitar when he was 10 and I&#x27;ll play the drums. They said, &#x27;All right, we&#x27;ll come down in one month and see you guys. Later in the interview Caleb admitted to the brothers &quot;kidnapping&quot; their cousin Matthew from his hometown in Mississippi for him to join the band. They told his mother that he was only going to be staying for a week but never allowed him to return home. &quot;We locked ourselves in the basement with an ounce of marijuana and literally spent a month down there. My mom would bring us food down&quot;, added Nathan. &quot;And at the end of that month the label people came and we had &#x27;Molly&#x27;s Chambers&#x27;, &#x27;California Waiting&#x27;, &#x27;Wicker Chair&#x27;, and &#x27;Holy Roller Novocaine&#x27;.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first record, an EP entitled &quot;Holy Roller Novocaine&quot;, was released on February 18, 2003. At this stage, Jared was only 16 years old and had not yet learned to play the bass. The release of &quot;Holy Roller Novocaine&quot; gave Kings of Leon a significant amount of exposure, receiving a 4/5 star rating from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. All of the songs released on the EP were co-written by Angelo Petraglia, who also produced the record, and four of the five songs would later be released on &quot;Youth and Young Manhood&quot;. The versions of &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and &quot;California Waiting&quot; on the EP differ from their album versions, however, with the first having a more tense riff and different vocal style than the same track off &quot;Youth and Young Manhood&quot;, the second being recorded in a rush to finish the EP. The EP also contains the song &quot;Wicker Chair&quot;, while a track called &quot;Andrea&quot; was discarded before its release. In addition, three songs from &quot;Holy Roller Novocaine&quot; were used in the Farrelly brothers film &quot;Stuck on You&quot; with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear: &quot;California Waiting&quot;, &quot;Molly&#x27;s Chambers&quot; and &quot;Holy Roller Novocaine&quot;.

===First albums and critical recognition: 2003–2006===

The Followills&#x27; debut album, &quot;Youth and Young Manhood&quot;, was released in the UK in July 2003 and in the United States that August. The album was recorded between Sound City Studios in Los Angeles and Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California. It was produced by Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, the band&#x27;s retro-chic look and blend of Southern boogie and gritty garage rock inspired comparisons to both Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Strokes. The album became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where &quot;NME&quot; declared it &quot;one of the best debut albums of the last 10 years&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the band as &quot;the kind of authentic, hairy rebels the Rolling Stones longed to be&quot;. The album still failed to make any significant impact in the US, where reviews were generally lukewarm and the modern rock audience was generally uninterested. In the United States, &quot;Youth and Young Manhood&quot; sold only 100,000 copies, compared with the 750,000 copies it moved abroad.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Aha Shake Heartbreak&quot;, was released in the UK in October 2004 and in the United States in February 2005. Building on the Southern-infused garage rock of their first album, the album broadened the band&#x27;s domestic and international audience. The album was again produced by Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns. &quot;The Bucket&quot;, &quot;Four Kicks&quot;, and &quot;King of the Rodeo&quot; were all released as singles, with &quot;The Bucket&quot; rising into the Top 20 in Britain. &quot;Taper Jean Girl&quot; was also used in the 2007 film &quot;Disturbia&quot; and the film &quot;Cloverfield&quot; in 2008. The band garnered accolades from several of their rock peers, including Elvis Costello, and also toured with U2, Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006.

===&quot;Because of the Times&quot; and &quot;Only by the Night&quot;: 2006–2010===

The band&#x27;s third album was titled &quot;Because of the Times&quot; and was released on April 2, 2007, in the UK, and a day later in the United States. The album release was preceded by the single &quot;On Call&quot;, which became a hit in both the UK and Ireland. The album debuted at number one in both UK and Ireland album charts and entered the European charts at number 25, selling approximately 70,000 copies in its first week of release. Although it was lauded by some critics, others found the album inferior to their previous efforts.

In 2008, Kings of Leon released its fourth studio album, &quot;Only by the Night&quot;, produced by Jacquire King and Angelo Petraglia on September 19, which subsequently entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and remained there for one more week. &quot;Only by the Night&quot; also had two single-week stints as the UK number one album in 2009, one directly after the BRIT Awards. In the United States, the album reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Reception to the album was the most polarized yet, with the British press granting the album glowing reviews, while in the United States, reactions to the album were more mixed. The album was officially named as the UK&#x27;s third-biggest-selling album of 2008 and the biggest-selling album of 2008 in Australia. &quot;Sex on Fire&quot; was the first single released for download in the UK on September 8. The song became the band&#x27;s most successful as it peaked at number one in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. They won Best International Band and Best International Album at the Brit Awards in 2009, where they also performed &quot;Use Somebody&quot; live. Kings of Leon also performed on March 14, 2009, at Sound Relief, a benefit concert, for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The song &quot;Crawl&quot; from this album was released as a free download on the band&#x27;s website on July 28. The third and fourth singles were &quot;Revelry&quot;, which peaked at number 19 in New Zealand, and &quot;Notion&quot;, which peaked at number 24 in Belgium. &quot;Only by the Night&quot; was certified Platinum in the United States by the RIAA for selling one million copies in less than a year after its release. In 2008, Kings of Leon headlined the Glastonbury Music Festival, and in 2009, the band headlined a number of music festivals, including Reading &amp; Leeds, Rock Werchter, Oxegen, T in the Park, Gurtenfestival and Open&#x27;er Festival in Poland, Europe, along with Sasquatch, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits in the United States.

The band released its first DVD, &quot;Live at the O2 London, England&quot;, on November 10, 2009. It was released on Blu-ray Disc on November 24, 2009. The footage was filmed in London&#x27;s O2 Arena on June 30, 2009, when the band performed a 22-song set in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 18,000 people. In an interview with Billboard.com, drummer Nathan stated, &quot;England is really the first place we broke [...] We figured what better place to make a live DVD than where the fans have been the craziest for the longest.&quot; The show featured songs from the four first of the band&#x27;s albums, and Nathan continued by saying, &quot;We just put the cameras in the back of our minds and acted like they weren&#x27;t even there.&quot;

In 2009 Kings of Leon founded Serpents and Snakes Records, a record label including such bands as the Features, Snowden, Turbo Fruits, and the Weeks.

On January 31, 2010, Kings of Leon took home the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Song for &quot;Use Somebody&quot; at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards.

===&quot;Come Around Sundown&quot;: 2010–2011===
The band&#x27;s fifth album, called &quot;Come Around Sundown&quot;, was released on October 18, 2010, in the UK, and October 19, 2010, in the US. It was recorded in Nashville and New York between February and June 2010 with Jacquire King and Angelo Petraglia once more at the helm. Following the release of &quot;Come Around Sundown&quot; in Australia, the band released all the tracks from the new album on their website.

In June 2010, the band embarked on a tour visiting more than 50 cities in North America and Europe. The tour dates ran from June 5 to September 23. In June they headlined the Slane Castle festival in Ireland, while they were informed of the death of their uncle Cleo. On July 27, 2011, during a concert in Dallas, Texas, singer Caleb Followill appeared to be heavily intoxicated and slurred incomprehensibly between songs, often rambling about nothing. He left the stage, claiming he was going to vomit, drink a beer and return to play three more songs. He never returned, causing the rest of the band to apologize to the crowd and end the concert abruptly. On August 1, 2011, the band announced through their website that the remainder of their US tour would be canceled with no reschedules due to dates they already had scheduled.

===Hiatus and &quot;Mechanical Bull&quot;: 2011–2014===
On October 31, 2011, the band announced that after the conclusion of their Australian tour in November that they would be going on hiatus. Nathan stated that the band&#x27;s hiatus should not take any longer than six months.

On August 22, 2012, Jared and Nick Brown from Mona released their song &quot;No Tell&quot; under the name Smoke &amp; Jackal. On August 23, 2012, when asked if it was the end of Kings of Leon with Smoke &amp; Jackal announced, Jared said &quot;Not even close. Working on album six very soon&quot;. Kings of Leon bassist Jared Followill confirmed that the band had finished recording their sixth LP, which was reported by &quot;NME&quot; to be released in September. The album title &quot;Mechanical Bull&quot; was revealed on June 7, and the album was released on September 24. The album&#x27;s first single, entitled &quot;Supersoaker&quot;, was released on July 17, 2013. The second single &quot;Wait for Me&quot; was released in the United Kingdom in August 2013 and debuted at number 31 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Last Mile Home&quot;, a song originally from the deluxe version of &quot;Mechanical Bull&quot;, had a stripped-down version written for the soundtrack of the film &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Walls&quot;: 2016–2019===
Following their New Year&#x27;s Eve show in Nashville, Nathan Followill said that the band was aiming to release its seventh album in 2016: &quot;We&#x27;ve already started pre-production in our studio for the next record, but the main thing on the calendar for 2016 is getting the record finished. And then the whole press machine kicks up and doing press for the record.&quot; Caleb added: &quot;We enjoy this part of the process. Obviously there&#x27;s a lot of work that goes into it and it can get stressful at times, but we&#x27;re all in a good place and we&#x27;re having fun with it and we&#x27;re all excited to do something new.&quot; The album was stated to be likely to be recorded in Los Angeles, with Caleb saying the band were looking for inspiration: &quot;We might just try to get a little change of scenery. Our first two albums we recorded in L.A., so we&#x27;re going to try to go back and see if it inspires us,&quot; he said. &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t, we always have a studio at home, so we can always come back.&quot;
In August, the band announced that the album title would be &quot;Walls&quot; (acronym for &quot;We Are Like Love Songs&quot;), and that it would be released October 14, 2016. The first single from the album, &quot;Waste a Moment&quot;, was released on September 9, 2016. The album went on to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. &quot;Walls&quot; moved 77,000 album units by the end of the week ending October 20.

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of &quot;Only by the Night&quot;, the band released a never-before-seen video containing behind the scenes footage of the recording of the album, serving as a video for &quot;Frontier City&quot;, which was originally a B-side to the album. Later that year, marking the 15th anniversary of &quot;Aha Shake Heartbreak&quot;, the song &quot;Where Nobody Knows&quot;, another B-side, was made available digitally for the first time.

===&quot;When You See Yourself&quot;: 2020–2023===
On March 31, 2020, the band released a live acoustic recording of its first new song in more than three years, &quot;Going Nowhere&quot;—later renamed &quot;Supermarket&quot; and be included on their eighth studio album &quot;When You See Yourself&quot;—through YouTube and various social media platforms. On January 1, 2021, the band teased the song &quot;The Bandit&quot; on Instagram, and subsequently posted five more teasers of new songs. The name of the album was announced on January 7, 2021, and the album was released on March 5, 2021. On the same day, the band released the album&#x27;s two lead singles; &quot;The Bandit&quot; and &quot;100,000 People&quot;. Like its predecessor the album was produced by Markus Dravs.

The band became the first to sell a newly-released album in the form of a non-fungible token, a type of cryptocurrency that contains unique assets such as music and art. The release came in the form of three different types of tokens for three separate packages in a series called &quot;NFT Yourself&quot;. They contained a special album package, a live show package, and an audiovisual package. The tokens were developed and hosted by YellowHeart, a ticketing platform employing blockchain technology. The album was the first NFT to be displayed at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. The band&#x27;s NFT also became the first to be launched to outer space on Inspiration4, the all-civilian space exploration, which was auctioned as a charity campaign.

===Going independent and &quot;Can We Please Have Fun&quot;: 2024–present===
Kings of Leon announced their ninth studio album &quot;Can We Please Have Fun&quot; on February 22, 2024. It was released on May 10, 2024, by LoveTap Records and Capitol Records, their first for those labels. The lead single, &quot;Mustang&quot;, was released the same day as the album&#x27;s announcement, followed by &quot;Splitscreen&quot; on March 29th and &quot;Nothing To Do&quot; on April 19th.

==In other media==
In early April 2011, an 87-minute film directed by Stephen C. Mitchell documenting the band members&#x27; lives was shown at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival in New York, called &quot;Talihina Sky&quot;, the name of an early Kings of Leon track. The Tribeca premiere was followed by scheduling a hometown premiere at the deadCENTER Film Festival in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on June 8, 2011.

The European premiere was hosted at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on June 25 and was followed by an interview session with the band. UK distributor Revolver Entertainment streamed the movie and interview session to 150 UK cinemas for a &quot;One Night Only&quot; live screening event. RCA Records later announced that the film would be released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on November 1, 2011.

Kings of Leon are mentioned in the Bedroom Philosopher&#x27;s song &quot;Northcote (So Hungover)&quot; as inspirational icons: &quot;Riding around on the 86, so hungover / Gonna go down to Pony, pretend I&#x27;m in Kings of Leon&quot;, and depicted in the music video.

Caleb, Nathan, and Jared Followill made a guest appearance in the &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; episode &quot;The High School Reunion&quot; (season 7, episode 12). The episode mocks the Fox musical-comedy &quot;Glee&quot;, which itself is set in a high school. The members of Kings of Leon dislike &quot;Glee&quot; and refused to let them use their music, and as fans of &quot;Sunny&quot;, asked to make a guest appearance.

In 2016 the Northern Ireland national football team made a historic run into the finals of the UEFA European Championships – branded as EURO 16 and held in France. The country’s first-ever goal and victory at the tournament came against Ukraine on 16 June in a 0–2 victory held at Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Lyon. The group of players that competed at the tournament have since been referred to in Northern Irish media as ‘The Kings of Lyon’.

Lana Del Rey mentions the band in the song &quot;White Dress&quot; from her 2021 album &quot;Chemtrails over the Country Club&quot;.

The cover of the &quot;Mechanical Bull&quot; album appears in the 2021 video game &quot;Life Is Strange: True Colors&quot; and the characters listen to the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Matter&quot;.

The band was selected to play as part of the festivities of the 2021 NFL draft at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.

<text>Degrees of general hardness (dGH or °GH) is a unit of water hardness, specifically of general hardness. General hardness is a measure of the concentration of divalent metal ions such as calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) per volume of water. Specifically, 1 dGH is defined as 10 milligrams (mg) of calcium oxide (CaO) per litre of water. Since CaO has a molar mass of 56.08 g/mol, 1 dGH is equivalent to 0.17832 mmol per litre of elemental calcium and/or magnesium ions.

In water testing hardness is often measured in parts per million (ppm), where one part per million is defined as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. Consequently, 1 dGH corresponds to 10 ppm CaO but 17.848 ppm CaCO3 which has a molar mass of 100.09 g/mol.

<text>Saïd Aouita (; born November 2, 1959) is a former Moroccan track and field athlete. He is the only athlete in history to have won a medal in each of the 800 meters and 5000 meters at the Olympic games. He won the 5000 meters at the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1987 World Championships in Athletics, as well as the 3000 meters at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships. He is a former world record holder over 1500 metres (3:29.46), 2000 m (4:50.81), 3000 m (7:29.45), and twice at 5000 m (13:00.40 and 12:58.39).

==Early life and education==
Saïd Aouita was born on November 2, 1959, in Kenitra, a coastal Moroccan city. Nine years later, he moved along with his family to Fes due to the nature of his father&#x27;s work. As a child he spent most of his time playing football and wanted to be a great footballer; however, his outstanding skills in running made his coaches foresee a great future in track and field.

Aouita has a Bachelor of Science degree in Management and master&#x27;s degree in Business Administration. He is pursuing a doctorate in Sport Management and Leadership.

==Running career==
Aouita had his first start towards stardom at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics held in Helsinki. He contested the 1500 m and finished third in the final, taking the bronze medal, after the pace slowed in the last 1000 meters and then finished with a sprint.

In 1984, Aouita decided to run the 5000 m at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Antonio Leitão from Portugal ran in first for the majority of the race. Aouita stayed behind Leitão and then sprinted past him on the last lap to win.

In 1985, Aouita ran two world records: first in 5000 m (13:00.40) in Oslo on 27 July, then in 1500 m (3:29.46) on 23 August.

In 1986 he missed setting the world record in the 3000 m by 0.44 of a second.
In 1987, Aouita&#x27;s main objective was to excel in the world championship held in Rome and break records. First, he broke the 2000 m world record with a time of 4:50.81 in Paris and only six days later, he surprised the world by breaking his own world record for 5000 m, becoming the first man to go under 13 minutes, with a time of 12:58.39 minutes. For the 1987 World Championships in Athletics, Aouita decided just to contest the 5000 m. In the 5000 m final, John Ngugi from Kenya set a fair pace, but by no means fast. Aouita, always in control of the race, made his move just before the bell, leading a mass sprint for the finish that he won in 13:26.44.

In 1988, at the 1988 Summer Olympics, he attempted to race in the 800 m and 1500 m but had a hamstring injury which made him finish third in 800 m and withdraw from the 1500 m although he had qualified for the semi-final. In spite of that his bronze medal made him the only athlete in history to combine medals at both 800 m and 5000 m.
In 1989, Aouita won the 3000 m at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest. Later that year, he broke the world record for the same distance in Köln, Germany with the time of 7:29.45 and thus, he was the first man in history to go under 7:30:00.

Aouita was a versatile middle and long distance runner, excelling at distances between 800 m and 10,000 m during the eighties. He raced and won against the Olympic champions Joaquim Cruz (800 m), Peter Rono (1500 m), John Ngugi (5000 m) and Alberto Cova (10000 m) over their respective main distances. Between September 1983 and September 1990 he won 115 of his 119 races. The defeats were against world champion Steve Cram over 1500 m, Olympic bronze medalist Alessandro Lambruschini over 3000 m steeplechase, Olympic champions Joaquim Cruz and Paul Ereng over 800 m and world champion Yobes Ondieki over 5000 m.

In the early nineties, Aouita underwent surgery on his leg, after which his doctors advised him to put an end to his career as an athlete for his health. After a set of failures in a number of races he decided to retire from athletics.

==Personal life==
Said Aouita married Khadija Skhir in 1983, one year before the 1984 Olympic Games. Together they have four children: one son, Adil, and three daughters; Soukaina, Sarah, and Zeena.

After his athletics career ended, Aouita worked with mixed success as a consultant for numerous sport institutions, as Technical National Manager in Morocco, and National Distance Coach in Australia thanks not only to his fruitful field experience, but also to his academic competences. Now, Aouita is working as Senior Analyst for Al Jazeera Sports channel. Aouita also has a sports clothing company which was established in 2009.

Aouita is featured on an Azerbaijani postage stamp.

He lives in Orlando, Florida.

<text>Römerstein is a municipality in Baden-Württemberg, Germany; three formerly independent villages (Böhringen, Donnstetten, Zainingen) and two hamlets (Strohweiler and Aglishardt) were merged in 1975. Administration seat is Böhringen.

The community is located on the Swabian Alb, in the northeastern corner of the district of Reutlingen. The community is named after the Römerstein, the highest hill of the region at 875 m. 

==Geography==
The municipality is located about 22 kilometers east of Reutlingen on the plateau of the Swabian Alb at an altitude of 803 m above sea level. NN (Rathaus Donnstetten). Römerstein reaches an elevation of 874 m above sea level at its highest point.

The municipality is bordered by Lenningen (Esslingen district) Wiesensteig (Göppingen District), Westerheim, Laichingen (both Alb-Donau-Kreis), Gutsbezirk Münsingen, Bad Urach and grave Stetten (all district Reutlingen).

==Municipality arrangement==
The community consists of the previously independent municipalities Böhringen, Donnstetten and Zainingen. The former municipalities Donnstetten and Zainingen today form localities within the definition of Baden-Württemberg municipal code with independent local councils and mayors. Böhringen includes the village of Böhringen, the hamlet of Strohweiler, and the homestead Aglishardt. Donnstetten includes the village of Donnstetten and the &quot;Haus Römersteinhäuser&quot;, an observation tower erected in 1912 on the Römerstein. Zainingen consists only the village of the same name.

In the municipality of Römerstein are several traces of former places which no longer exist; in the territory of the village Böhringen the 1487 as &quot;Fischenhusen&quot;, and probably in Aglishardt &quot;Fischhausen&quot;, &quot;zu dem Gaiswyler&quot; mentioned in 1454, &quot;Gölenbrunnen&quot;, &quot;Hofen&quot;, two places mentioned in 1275: &quot;Ichenhusen&quot; and &quot;Horgenloch&quot;, &quot;Katzensteig&quot;, mentioned around 1192 as &quot;Cazcensteige&quot;, &quot;Oberwiler&quot; mentioned in 1454 as &quot;Oberweiler&quot;, &quot;Vohenhausen&quot; mentioned in 1345 as &quot;uf Vohenhusen&quot;, and &quot;Zimmerbuch&quot;, mentioned in 1204 as &quot;Zimberbuch&quot; and in 1299 as &quot;Zymberbuch&quot;. In the territory of the village Donnstetten are the two deserted villages of &quot;Beuren&quot;, attested by a toponym, and &quot;Roter Hof&quot;

==History==
Presumably the settlement was in the Roman settlement back Clarenna. The identification of the Roman town Clarenna which is passed down through the Peutingertafel is, with the archaeological finds in Donnstetten very likely, but not absolutely certain.
Main article: Castle Donnstetten
The municipality Römerstein originated during the Baden-Württemberg district reform on 1 January 1975 as a merger of the formerly independent municipalities Böhringen (with thatched hamlets and Aglishardt) Donnstetten and Zainingen. The entire current community area was formerly part of the district of Münsingen and came with its resolution 1973 the district of Reutlingen .

<text>Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business (1985) is a book by educator Neil Postman. It has been translated into eight languages and sold some 200,000 copies worldwide. In 2005, Postman&#x27;s son Andrew reissued the book in a 20th anniversary edition.

==Origins==

The book&#x27;s origins are rooted in a talk Postman gave to the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1984, in which he was a participant in a panel on George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and the contemporary world. In the introduction to &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot;, Postman said that the contemporary world was better reflected by Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, whose public was oppressed by their addiction to amusement, rather than by Orwell&#x27;s work, where they were oppressed by state violence.

==Summary==
Postman distinguishes the Orwellian vision of the future, in which totalitarian governments seize individual rights, from that offered by Aldous Huxley in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; where people medicate themselves into bliss, thereby voluntarily sacrificing their rights. Drawing an analogy with the latter scenario, Postman sees television&#x27;s entertainment value as a present-day &quot;soma&quot;, the fictitious pleasure drug in &quot;Brave New World&quot;, by means of which the citizens&#x27; rights are exchanged for consumers&#x27; entertainment.

The essential premise of the book, which Postman extends to the rest of his argument(s), is that &quot;form excludes the content&quot;, that is, a particular medium can only sustain a particular level of ideas. Thus rational argument, integral to print typography, is against by the medium of television for this reason. Owing to this shortcoming, politics and religion are diluted, and &quot;news of the day&quot; becomes a packaged commodity. Television de-emphasizes the quality of information in favor of satisfying the far-reaching needs of entertainment, by which information is encumbered and to which it is subordinate.

Postman asserts the presentation of television news is a form of entertainment programming; arguing that the inclusion of theme music, the interruption of commercials, and &quot;talking hairdos&quot; bear witness that televised news cannot readily be taken seriously. Postman further examines the differences between written speech, which he argues reached its prime in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and the forms of televisual communication, which rely mostly on visual images to &quot;sell&quot; lifestyles. He argues that, owing to this change in public discourse, politics has ceased to be about a candidate&#x27;s ideas and solutions, but whether he comes across favorably on television. Television, he notes, has introduced the phrase &quot;now this&quot;, which implies a &quot;complete absence&quot; of connection between the separate topics the phrase ostensibly connects. Larry Gonick used this phrase to conclude his &quot;Cartoon Guide to (Non)Communication&quot;, instead of the traditional &quot;the end&quot;.

Postman refers to the inability to act upon much of the so-called information from televised sources as the information-action ratio. He contends that &quot;television is altering the meaning of &#x27;being informed&#x27; by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing&quot;.

Drawing on the ideas of media scholar Marshall McLuhan – altering McLuhan&#x27;s aphorism &quot;the medium is the message&quot; to &quot;the medium is the metaphor&quot; – he describes how oral, literate, and televisual cultures radically differ in the processing and prioritization of information; he argues that each medium is appropriate for a different kind of knowledge. The faculties requisite for rational inquiry are simply weakened by televised viewing. Accordingly, reading, a prime example cited by Postman, exacts intense intellectual involvement, at once interactive and dialectical; whereas television only requires passive involvement.

Postman argues that commercial television has become derivative of advertising. Moreover, modern television commercials are not &quot;a series of testable, logically ordered assertions&quot; rationalizing consumer decisions, but &quot;is a drama—a mythology, if you will—of handsome people&quot; being driven to &quot;near ecstasy by their good fortune&quot; of possessing advertised goods or services. &quot;The truth or falsity of an advertiser&#x27;s claim is simply not an issue&quot; because more often than not &quot;no claims are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the drama.&quot; Because commercial television is programmed according to ratings, its content is determined by commercial feasibility, not critical acumen. Television in its present state, he says, does not satisfy the conditions for honest intellectual involvement and rational argument.

He repeatedly states that the eighteenth century, the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, was the pinnacle for rational argument. Only in the printed word, he states, could complicated truths be rationally conveyed. Postman gives a striking example: many of the first fifteen U.S. presidents could probably have walked down the street without being recognized by the average citizen, yet all these men would have been quickly known by their written words. However, the reverse is true today. The names of presidents or even famous preachers, lawyers, and scientists call up visual images, typically television images, but few, if any, of their words come to mind. The few that do almost exclusively consist of carefully chosen soundbites. Postman mentions Ronald Reagan, and comments upon Reagan&#x27;s abilities as an entertainer.

==In popular culture==

Roger Waters&#x27; 1992 album &quot;Amused to Death&quot; is named after Postman&#x27;s book, and is in part inspired by and deals with some of the same subject matter. In &quot;The End of Education&quot;, Postman remarked that the album&#x27;s reference to his work,

Postman&#x27;s concept of the &quot;information-action ratio&quot; was referenced in the Arctic Monkeys song &quot;Four Out of Five&quot; off the band&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino&quot;, where the Information Action Ratio is the name of a fictional taqueria on the moon.

In a 2019 interview with Kjersti Flaa, comic and actor Zach Galifianakis references &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; with the line &quot;you will stop hearing the term &#x27;big brother&#x27; because we will do it to ourselves.&quot; Galifianakis employed the quotation in response to a question the interviewer asked about whether or not he uses social media, to which he replied with a denunciation of the negative effects of the internet on society in general.

<doc id="842198" wikidata="Q643327" url="?curid=842198" title="Purchase order">
<text>A purchase order, often abbreviated to PO, is a commercial document issued by a buyer to a seller, indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services required. It is used to control the purchasing of products and services from external suppliers. Purchase orders can be an essential part of enterprise resource planning system orders.
An indent is a purchase order often placed through an agent (indent agent) under specified conditions of sale.
The issue of a purchase order does not itself form a contract. If no prior contract exists, then it is the acceptance of the order by the seller that forms a contract between the buyer and seller.
== Overview ==
Purchase orders allow buyers to clearly and openly communicate with the sellers to maintain transparency. They may also help a purchasing agent to manage incoming orders and pending orders. Sellers are also protected by the use of purchase orders, in case of a buyer&#x27;s refusal to pay for goods or services.
Purchase orders provide benefits in that they streamline the purchasing process in a standard procedure. Commercial lenders or financial institutions may provide financial assistance on the basis of purchase orders. There are various trade finance facilities that almost every financial institution allows business people to use against purchase orders such as:
# Before shipment credit facility
# Post shipment credit facility
# Trade finance facility
# Foreign bill purchase credit facility
# Bill retirement credit facility
# Order confirmation
# Followup
The purpose of purchase orders is to procure materials for direct consumption or for stock, procure services, fulfil customer requirements using external resources, or procure a material that is required in production from an internal source (long-distance intra-plant stock transfers). They may also place once-only procurement transactions and optimize purchasing by taking full advantage of negotiated conditions or for optimal utilisation of existing resource capacities.
Creating a purchase order is typically the first step of the purchase-to-pay process in an ERP system. Purchase orders may require a SKU code.

Many organisations encourage staff to use a purchasing card (or procurement card) for low value purchases instead of issuing a purchase order.

Future business scenarios anticipate a reduced role for purchase orders or even their full elimination, leaving organizations with a smaller and more strategic procurement function than in the past. Kai Nowosel and Kris Timmermans of consultants Accenture ask why purchase orders and invoices are needed when digital systems can deliver goods confirmations and authorize funds, and suggest that digital functionality and supply analytics will change the landscape for purchase orders and processes &quot;in the coming years&quot;.

== Legal ==
Although a typical purchase order may not be worded as a contract (in fact most contain little more than a list of the goods or services the buyer desires to purchase, along with price, payment terms, and shipping instructions), the purchase order is a specially regarded instrument regulated by the Uniform Commercial Code or other similar law which establishes a purchase order as a contract by its nature. Yet despite the nature of the purchase order as a contract, it is common to accompany the acceptance of a purchase order with a legal document such as the terms and conditions of sale, which establish specific or additional legal conditions of the contract.
The US Federal Acquisition Regulation states that purchase orders should generally be issued on a fixed-price basis, but provision is also made for unpriced purchase orders to be issued where &quot;it is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the purchase order&quot;.
In the UK, the Office of Government Commerce noted with concern in 2010 that &quot;contracting authorities [were] not always raising purchase orders&quot;, and that where they were used, invoices were not always being reconciled to purchase orders before payment. Some organisations operate a &quot;No PO, no pay&quot; policy, which means that invoices which do not refer to a purchase order number will be returned to the supplier unpaid. The City of London Corporation, for example, operates such a policy.

== Formats ==
===Electronic===
Many purchase orders are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over the Internet. It is common for electronic purchase orders to be used to buy goods or services of any type online.
There are many names for Electronic Purchase Orders. It is sometimes known as: E-Procurement, E-Purchasing, E-Purchase Requisition. These terms are normally all referring to Electronic Purchase Orders.

===Non-electronic===
The record of purchase order in most business firms are still on paper and thus there is a need for proper purchase order format. Many users wish to have professional formatting for purchase orders for several reasons. A company may wish to have a strong understanding of purchase transactions or to know the basic requirements of purchase order. It may also make it part of business documentation, which makes the process easier while keeping record of all transactions and to have good impression on the client or customer.

==Planned purchase order==
The term &quot;planned purchase order&quot; (PPO) is used to refer to a buyer&#x27;s commitment to purchase goods or services from a single supplier on a long term basis, with individual purchase orders specifying the quantities required from time to time.

== Purchase order request==

A purchase order request or purchase requisition is a request sent internally within a company to obtain purchased goods and services, including stock. The request is a document which tells the purchasing department or manager exactly what items and services are requested, the quantity, source and associated costs.
A Purchase Requisition Form (PRF) is filled out prior to purchasing goods as a form of tangible authorisation. Purchase request forms are often used in smaller business who do not have a computer-based system. However, many computer (included web-based solution) systems are available on the market that can facilitate the capture of purchase request information. Purchase order requests can also be passed to the purchasing department via a management information system.
A PRF may contain budget and purchase values to make the individual aware of the annual and remaining budget before a purchase is made. Such a system is there to guarantee that goods and services are purchased with the consent of the line manager and that a sufficient budget is available.

== Purchase Order Finance (or PO Finance) ==
[edit source]
The term &quot;purchase order finance&quot; (PO finance) is used to refer to a type of financing that helps buyers to receive financing help from another entity to prepay the cost of goods (and sometimes services). This takes the form of a loan or purchase agreement that can be with or without recourse, depending upon the structure of the deal. There are very few purchase order finance companies, as the market is small, niche, and rarely advertise. Oftentimes, PO finance companies will work alongside factoring or accounts receivables finance companies to provide a complete financing package. Factoring companies like LSQ, Riviera Funding, and Triumph, among others, work with companies like King Trade or PayMeFaster to achieve the combined package of PO financing and receivables financing (factoring). 

Many transactions are between a Client company that is selling to a large Buyer, and buying from a Supplier in Asia, South America, or Europe. An example would be that Client buys goods from Supplier at $500 per item and sells to Buyer for $600 per item. In this case, the PO finance company would help by paying for (financing) the goods from the Supplier at $500, those ship to the Client, then the Buyer. 30-60-90-120 days later, the Buyer and would pay the PO finance company at $600 per item. The PO finance company would then pay down their loan and remit the balance to Client.

<text>Antoine Alexandre Brutus Bussy (29 May 1794 – 1 February 1882) was a French chemist who primarily studied pharmaceuticals. He, alongside Friedrich Wöhler, first isolated beryllium.

== Education ==
Antoine Bussy entered the École Polytechnique in 1813, and there followed the courses delivered by Pierre Robiquet, the great French chemist who was to make decisive breakthroughs in bio-chemistry (he isolated the first amino-acid ever identified, asparagin, in 1805–1806), in industrial dyes (he isolated and identified alizarin, the most famous and first modern industrial red dye) and the pick-up of modern medication (he isolated, identified and started mass production of codeine, 1832). Robiquet tutored Antoine Bussy in his career as a chemist researcher and in his private career as pharmacist as well. In 1828 Bussy published a preliminary notice of a new method of preparing magnesium by heating magnesium chloride and potassium in a glass tube. When the potassium chloride was washed out, small globules of magnesium remained.

<text>An invoice, bill, tab, or bill of costs is a commercial document that includes an itemized list of goods or services furnished by a seller to a buyer relating to a sale transaction, that usually specifies the price and terms of sale., quantities, and agreed-upon prices and terms of sale for products or services the seller had provided the buyer.

Payment terms are usually stated on the invoice. These may specify that the buyer has a maximum number of days to pay and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date. The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice. To avoid confusion and consequent unnecessary communications from buyer to seller, some sellers clearly state in large and capital letters on an invoice whether it has already been paid.

From a seller&#x27;s point of view, an invoice is a &quot;sales invoice&quot;. From a buyer&#x27;s point of view, an invoice is a &quot;purchase invoice&quot;. The document indicates the buyer and seller, but the term &quot;invoice&quot; indicates money is owed &quot;or&quot; owing.

==History==
Invoices appear as one of the very earliest manifestations of written records in ancient Mesopotamia. The practice of invoicing can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Around 5,000 years ago, merchants in Mesopotamia used cuneiform script on clay tablets to document trade transactions, including details such as quantities, prices, and the parties involved. These records functioned as contracts and receipts. In ancient Egypt, transactions and tax records were documented on papyrus scrolls, serving as an early method of financial record-keeping. The invention of paper in China around AD 105 facilitated advancements in documentation, eventually spreading to the Middle East and Europe.

During the Middle Ages, European merchants began using handwritten invoices to detail sales transactions, often recording information such as dates, descriptions of goods, quantities and prices. The printing press was introduced in the 15th century that enabled the production of standardized invoice forms, contributing to more consistent financial documentation.

By the 19th century, printed invoices became widespread, with businesses incorporating elements such as company names, addresses, and logos. The 20th and 21st centuries saw the transition to digital and automated invoicing systems, further improving efficiency and record-keeping practices.

==Format==

The typical format of an invoice starts with a header prominently featuring the term &quot;Invoice&quot;. This is usually followed by information needed to establish the context of the transactions such as the name, address, and contact information of the parties involved (e.g. buyer and seller) and important dates such as when payment must be received. The main body of the invoice provides an itemized list of goods or services rendered, specifying descriptions, unit prices, quantities, and total prices for each line item. Additional financial elements like taxes, shipping charges, and discounts are separately enumerated and added to the subtotal to calculate the grand total amount due. The invoice often concludes with standardized elements or other information not included in the pre-body. This structured format serves various functions, including billing, accounting, auditing, and, in cases of disagreement, legal evidence for dispute resolution.

Header

* The word &quot;Invoice&quot;
* Seller&#x27;s logo
* Invoice Number
* Seller&#x27;s and Buyer&#x27;s Contact Information
* Invoice Date
* Payment Due Date
* Shipping Information
* Date of sending or delivery of the goods or service;
* Credit Terms
* Purchase-order number (or similar tracking numbers requested by the buyer to be mentioned on the invoice);

Body

* List of Goods/Services
* Description of the product(s);
* Unit price(s) of the product(s), if relevant;
* Subtotal
* Tax amounts, if relevant (e.g., GST or VAT);
* Discounts
* Shipping Charges
* Total Amount Due

Footer

* Payment details (such as indicating one or more acceptable methods of payment, and details about charges for late payments, etc.);
* Credit Terms
* Tax or company registration details of the seller, if relevant, e.g. ABN for Australian businesses or VAT number for businesses in the EU;
* Advanced details (including vehicle no, LR no., LR date, mode of transport, net weight, gross weight, tare weight, out time, freight type, driver name, drive contact no. etc.)

In countries where wire transfer is the preferred method of settling debts, the printed bill will contain the bank account number of the creditor and usually a reference code to be passed along with the transaction identifying the payer.

The European Union requires a VAT (value-added tax) identification number for official VAT invoices, which all VAT-registered businesses are required to issue to their customers. In the UK, this number may be omitted on invoices if the words &quot;this is not a VAT invoice&quot; are present on the invoice. Such an invoice is called a pro-forma invoice, and is not an adequate substitute for a full VAT invoice for VAT-registered customers.

In Canada, the registration number for GST purposes must be furnished for all supplies over $30 made by a registered supplier in order to claim input tax credits.

Recommendations about invoices used in international trade are also provided by the UNECE Committee on Trade, which involves a more detailed description of the logistics aspect of merchandise and, therefore may be convenient for international logistics and customs procedures.

==Variations==
There are different types of invoices:
* Pro forma invoice – In foreign trade, a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is a document that states a commitment from the seller to provide specified goods to the buyer at specific prices. It is often used to declare value for customs. It is not an actual invoice, and thus the seller does not record a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice as an account receivable and the buyer does not record a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice as an account payable. A &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is not issued by the seller until the seller and buyer have agreed to the terms of the order. In a few cases, a &quot;pro forma&quot; invoice is issued to request advance payments from the buyer, either to allow production to start or for security of the goods produced.
* Credit memo - If the buyer returns the goods, the seller usually issues a credit memo for the same or lower amount than the invoice, and then refunds the money to the buyer, or the buyer can apply that credit memo to another invoice.
* Commercial invoice - a customs declaration form used in international trade that describes the parties involved in the shipping transaction, the goods being transported, and the value of the goods. It is the primary document used by customs, and must meet specific customs requirements, such as the Harmonized System number and the country of manufacture. It is used to calculate tariffs.
* Debit memo - When a company fails to pay or short-pays an invoice, it is common practice to issue a &quot;debit memo&quot; for the balance and any late fees owed. In function, debit memos are identical to invoices.
* Self-billing invoice - A &quot;self billing invoice&quot; is used when a buyer issues the invoice to themselves (e.g. according to the consumption levels he is taking out of a vendor-managed inventory stock). The buyer (i.e. the issuer) should treat the invoice as an account payable and the seller should treat it as an account receivable. If there is tax on the sale, e.g. VAT or GST, then the buyer and seller may need to adjust their tax accounts in accordance with tax legislation. Under Article 224 of the EU VAT Directive, self-billing processes may only be used &quot;if there is a prior agreement between the two parties and provided that a procedure exists for the acceptance of each invoice&quot; by the supplier. A Self-Billing Agreement will usually provide for the supplier not to issue their own sales invoices as well.
* Evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) - ERS is a process of paying for goods and services from a packing slip rather than from a separate invoice document. The payee uses data in the packing slip to apply for the payments. &quot;In an ERS transaction, the supplier ships goods based upon an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN), and the purchaser, upon receipt, confirms the existence of a corresponding purchase order or contract, verifies the identity and quantity of the goods, and then pays the supplier.&quot;
* Timesheet - Invoices for hourly services issued by businesses such as lawyers and consultants often pull data from a . A timesheet invoice may also be generated by Operated equipment rental companies where the invoice will be a combination of timesheet based charges and equipment rental charges.
* Statement - A periodic customer statement includes opening balance, invoices, payments, credit memos, debit memos, and ending balance for the customer&#x27;s account during a specified period. A monthly statement can be used as a summary invoice to request a single payment for accrued monthly charges.
* Progress billing used to obtain partial payment on extended contracts, particularly in the construction industry (see Schedule of values)
* Collective Invoicing is also known as monthly invoicing in Japan. Japanese businesses tend to have many orders with small amounts because of the outsourcing system (Keiretsu), or of demands for less inventory control (Kanban). To save the administration work, invoicing is normally processed on monthly basis.
* Continuation Invoicing or Recurring Invoicing is standard within the equipment rental industry, including tool rental. A recurring invoice is one generated on a cyclical basis during the lifetime of a rental contract. For example, if you rent an excavator from 1 January to 15 April, on a calendar monthly arrears billing cycle, you would expect to receive an invoice at the end of January, another at the end of February, another at the end of March and a final Off-rent invoice would be generated at the point when the asset is returned. The same principle would be adopted if you were invoiced in advance, or if you were invoiced on a specific day of the month.
* Electronic Invoicing is not necessarily the same as EDI invoicing. Electronic invoicing in its widest sense embraces EDI as well as XML invoice messages as well as other formats such as Acrobat/PDF. Historically, formats such as PDF were not included in the wider definition of an electronic invoice because they were not machine readable and the process benefits of an electronic message could not be achieved. However, as data extraction techniques have evolved and as environmental concerns have begun to dominate the business case for the implementation of electronic invoicing, other formats are now incorporated into the wider definition.

==Electronic==

Some invoices are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over the Internet. It is still common for electronic remittance or invoicing to be printed in order to maintain paper records. Standards for electronic invoicing vary widely from country to country. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards such as the United Nation&#x27;s EDIFACT standard include message encoding guidelines for electronic invoices. The EDIFACT is followed up in the UN/CEFACT ebXML syntax cross industry invoice.

===EDIFACT===
The United Nations standard for electronic invoices (&quot;INVOIC&quot;) includes standard codes for transmitting header information (common to the entire invoice) and codes for transmitting details for each of the line items (products or services). The &quot;INVOIC&quot; standard can also be used to transmit credit and debit memos.

In the European Union legislation was passed in 2010 in the form of directive 2010/45/EU to facilitate the growth of Electronic Invoicing across all its member states. This legislation caters for varying VAT and inter-country invoicing requirements within the EU, in addition to legislating for the authenticity and integrity of invoices being sent electronically. It is estimated that in 2011 alone roughly 5 million EU businesses will have sent Electronic Invoices.

===Open Application Group Integration Specification from OAGi===
The XML message format for electronic invoices has been used since the inception of XML in 1998. Open Application Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) has included an invoice since 2001. The Open Applications Group (OAGi) has a working relationship with UN/CEFACT where OAGi and its members participate in defining many of the Technology and Methodology specifications. OAGi also includes support for these Technology and Methodology specifications within OAGIS.

===CEFACT and UBL===

There are two XML-based standards currently being developed. One is the cross industry invoice under development by the United Nations standards body UN/CEFACT and the other is Universal Business Language (UBL) which is issued by Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Implementations of invoices based on UBL are common, most importantly in the public sector in Denmark as it was the first country where the use of UBL was mandated by law for all invoices in the public sector. Further implementations are underway in the Scandinavian countries as result of the North European Subset project. Implementations are also underway in Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands (UBL 2.0) and with the European Commission itself.

The NES work has been transferred to European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the standards body of the European Union), workshop CEN/BII, for public procurement in Europe. The result of that work is PEPPOL. There UBL procurement documents are implemented between various European countries.

An agreement was made between UBL and UN/CEFACT for convergence of the two XML messages standards with the objective of merging the two standards into one before end of 2009, including the provision of an upgrade path for implementations started in either standard.

===ISDOC===
ISDOC is a standard that was developed in the Czech Republic as a universal format for electronic invoices. On 16 October 2008, 14 companies and the Czech government signed a declaration to use this format within one year in their products.

===E-invoicing===
After implantation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, concept of e-invoicing has been introduced for businesses with a turnover of more than Rs 5 crore from 1 August 2023. Now reporting of Business to Business (B2B) invoices for notified category of taxpayer. As of 2022, Business to Consumer (B2C) invoices are exempt from e-invoicing.

==Payment==
Organizations purchasing goods and services usually have a process in place for approving payment of invoices based on an employee&#x27;s confirmation that the goods or services have been received.

Typically, when paying an invoice, a remittance advice will be sent to the supplier to inform them their invoice has been paid.

Non-payment and late payment of invoices is estimated to be the cause of 25% of corporate bankruptcies. To mitigate this, the European Commission has introduced the Late Payment Directive that sets a limit on businesses to settle their invoices within 60 days.

<text>The Breeders&#x27; Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf is a Weight for Age Thoroughbred horse race on turf for fillies and mares, three years old and up. It is held annually at a different racetrack in the United States as part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships.

The race is run at either or , depending on the turf course configuration at the Breeders&#x27; Cup host track. For tracks which can accommodate either distance (Belmont, Woodbine, and Santa Anita ), it is run at miles. The 2015 edition at Keeneland was conducted at miles because that track&#x27;s turf course configuration does not allow for the two regular distances to be conducted on it. For the same reason, the 2017 edition at Del Mar was held at a distance of miles.

== Automatic berths ==
Beginning in 2007, the Breeders&#x27; Cup developed the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge, a series of races in each division that allotted automatic qualifying bids to winners of defined races. Each of the fourteen divisions has multiple qualifying races. Note though that one horse may win multiple challenge races, while other challenge winners will not be entered in the Breeders&#x27; Cup for a variety of reasons such as injury or travel considerations.

In the Filly &amp; Mare Turf division, runners are limited to 14 and there are up to nine automatic berths. The 2022 &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; races were:
# the Paddock Stakes, a Group 1 race run in January at Kenilworth race course in South Africa
# the Victoria Mile, a Grade 1 race run in May at Tokyo Racecourse in Japan
# the Gran Premio Pamplona, a Group 1 run in June at Hipódromo de Monterrico in Peru 
# the Beverly D. Stakes, a Grade 1 race run in August at Churchill Downs in Kentucky
# the Yorkshire Oaks, a Group 1 race run in August at York Racecourse in England
# the Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes, a Grade 1 race at Saratoga Race Course in New York
# the Matron Stakes, a Group 1 race run in September at Leopardstown in Ireland 
# the Rodeo Drive Stakes, a Grade 1 race run in October at Santa Anita Park in California
# the Prix de l&#x27;Opéra, a Group 1 race run in October at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France

<doc id="842210" wikidata="Q978936" url="?curid=842210" title="Vaal Dam">
<text>The Vaal Dam in South Africa was constructed in 1938 and lies 77 km south of OR Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg. The lake behind the dam wall has a surface area of about and is 47 meters deep. The Vaal Dam lies on the Vaal River, which is one of South Africa&#x27;s strongest-flowing rivers. Other rivers flowing into the dam are the Wilge River, Molspruit and Grootspruit. It has over of shoreline and is South Africa&#x27;s second biggest dam by area and the fourth largest by volume.

==History==
The construction of Vaal Dam started during the depression of the early thirties and the dam was completed in 1938 with a wall height of above lowest foundation and a full supply capacity of . The dam is a concrete gravity structure with an earthfill section on the right flank. It was built as a joint venture by Rand Water and the Department of Irrigation (now known as the Department of Water Affairs).

The dam was subsequently raised in the early fifties to a height of which increased the capacity to . A second raising took place in 1985 when the wall was raised by a further to above lowest foundation. The capacity of the dam is currently and a further or 26% can be stored temporarily for flood attenuation.

The flood attenuation properties of the dam were severely tested in February 1996 when the largest flood ever recorded at the Vaal Dam site was experienced. An inflow of over was measured into the Vaal Dam which was already at full capacity due to good rains and it was only through the expert management of the Hydrology staff at DWAF that the maximum flood released from the dam was limited to . Flows above would have caused serious damage downstream of Vaal Dam and the situation during the 1996 flood became extremely tense as the storage in the reservoir peaked at 118.5% of Full Supply Capacity on 19 February 1996 i.e. only of flood absorption capacity remained before the full inflow would have been released causing massive damage.

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project feeds water into the system by gravity contributing to a stable supply of water to the people and industrial complex of Gauteng. This water is piped from Lesotho into the Liebenbergsvlei and Wilge Rivers.

The Sterkfontein Dam forms part of the Tugela-Vaal water transfer scheme for the interbasin transfer of water from the Thukela River in KwaZulu-Natal to boost the levels in the Vaal River System. Water from the Sterkfontein Dam is released once the Vaal Dam drops to below 16%.

The dam has its own island some long. The island was used as a secret meeting place by the apartheid government but now hosts the annual Round the Island Yacht race, a Guinness Book of World Records title of the largest inland yacht race.

On 4 May 1948 BOAC introduced Short Solent flying boats on the UK (Southampton) to South Africa (Vaaldam) service. The small village of Deneysville was used as a stop-over point by the old BOAC flying boats.

==Water sports==
The Vaal Dam is a fishing venue for freshwater carp and catfish. Its shores are filled with anglers throughout the year.

Many world class water sport events are held here including the annual &quot;Round The Island&quot; yacht race organized by Lake Deneys Yacht Club— a race that has been in the Guinness Book of Records for being the &quot;Most Yachts in an Inland Yacht Race in the World&quot;, in which 389 craft crossed the finish line. This race has entered the Guinness Book of Records for the most boats in an inland yacht race. Several large events take place here including Keelboat Week and the Bayshore 200 km jetski race, and now the Bayshore Marina Vaal Dam Treasure Hunt. Lake Deneys Yacht Club and Pennant Nine Yacht Club partnered the organisation of a fleet which participated in the inaugural 2014 and second 2015 international &quot;Bart&#x27;s Bash&quot;.

Three provinces make up the Dam&#x27;s shoreline - the Free State has the longest stretch, Mpumalanga has a beautiful and relatively unspoilt shoreline, while the most despoiled by far is that of Gauteng. The dam was commissioned in 1939, has a capacity of , and a surface area of , the dam wall is high. Due to the large lake size reservoir there is a problem with evaporation, see Sterkfontein Dam for more details.

Deneysville is the largest town on the Vaal Dam and provides a shopping centre for the Dam. There are three yacht clubs and two marinas.

==Nature==
The main angling fish species of the Vaal dam are barbel, common carp, mirror carp, grass carp, smallmouth yellowfish, largemouth yellowfish and mudfish. Egyptian geese and blacksmith lapwing are abundant shore birds, and Caspian terns also occur in large numbers. The greater flamingo is a regular wading bird, with lesser flamingo present in lower numbers, and vagrant openbills have been seen. A few dozen fish eagles are present, while osprey occurs sparsely.

<doc id="842212" wikidata="Q164067" url="?curid=842212" title="Herzog Zwei">
<text>(; ) is a real-time strategy video game developed by Technosoft and published by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis. An early real-time strategy game, it predates the genre-popularizing &quot;Dune II&quot;. It was released first in Japan in 1989 and worldwide in 1990. It is the sequel to &quot;Herzog&quot;, which was available on the Japanese MSX and PC-8801 personal computers.

&quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft&#x27;s own &quot;Thunder Force&quot; series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy. It has been cited as an inspiration to the developers of &quot;Warcraft&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Dune II&quot;, and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; and is also considered a precursor to the MOBA genre.

==Gameplay==
The player directly pilots a flying, transforming mech, similar to the variable fighter depicted in &quot;Macross&quot;. It is a multi-role vehicle suited for utility and combat. Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed. Tactical re-deployment (mission reassignment, vehicle repair) involves a great deal of micromanagement, due to the required involvement of the mech.

Both the player&#x27;s ground forces and the mech have finite fuel and ammunition. A prolonged engagement requires considerable micromanagement, as vehicles will not auto-repair, and the fragile combat-supply vehicles have a limited radius of service.

With a total of eight different types of land units to purchase, the player can determine the composition of his army. Each combat vehicle type represents a tradeoff between speed, anti-air, ground-attack, and cost. Units are assigned mission orders from a menu selection: &quot;fight from a fixed position&quot;, &quot;patrol this area&quot;, &quot;fight in fixed radius&quot; and &quot;go to/attack/occupy intermediate base&quot;. New orders can only be issued during the airlift, and every time a unit&#x27;s mission orders are reassigned, a cost is incurred.

In addition to the player&#x27;s main base, there are nine permanent outposts scattered across the battlefield. These indestructible buildings are the only production resources on the battlefield. Once under a player&#x27;s control, an outpost generates additional revenue (for purchase of units) and serves as a remote base of operations (repair/refuel, pick up delivery of purchased unit). A key strategy is to capture as many outposts as possible or deny enemy use through nuisance actions.

&quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; supports both single-player mode against the AI, as well as a two-player multiplayer mode. In single-player, the entire screen is devoted to the human-player&#x27;s field of view. The game partially offsets the AI&#x27;s inherent weakness by increasing the armor and offensive damage of computer player side with each advancing level.

== Reception ==
&quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; was not a huge commercial success, due to its lack of marketing, relatively early release on the Genesis platform, and non-arcade genre on what was considered an arcade game console. Upon its 1990 release in North America, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the game a rating of 4.25 out of 10, based on four individual reviewer scores of 4, 6, 4, and 3.

The Mega Drive version&#x27;s reception in Europe was generally more positive. In the United Kingdom, in the April 1990 issue of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, reviewer Paul Glancey gave the game an 82% score. He described it as &quot;a game of conquest between two commanders in real time&quot; and stated that what &quot;sets it apart from other strategy games is that everything happens in real time. Both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken so you have to think on the move or die&quot;. He noted that the command icons are &quot;fairly easy to grasp&quot; and concluded that it is a game that helps establish the Mega Drive as a &quot;real&quot; computer rather than &quot;a machine for immobilized arcade players&quot;. Warren Lapworth reviewed the game in the March 1990 issue of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; magazine, giving the game a 75% score. He described it as an &quot;unusual product&quot; and stated that &quot;whether it&#x27;s intended to get strategists to consider buying the console or to broaden the horizons of trigger-happy lunatics, I don&#x27;t know. Either way, it&#x27;s quite refreshing and can be quite addictive in two-player mode, fierce rivalry developing between friends&quot;. In France, the game was reviewed in the November 1990 issue of &quot;Joystick&quot; magazine, where reviewer JM Destroy gave the game a 78% score. The game was particularly well received in Germany, where it was known as &quot;Herzog 2&quot;; &quot;Power Play&quot; magazine gave it an 80% score in its April 1990 issue, and &quot;Play Time&quot; gave it an 85% score in its June 1991 issue.

=== Retrospective coverage ===
Retrospective reviews have been very positive. David Filip of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave the game a score of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as &quot;one of the first&quot; and &quot;one of the best&quot; strategy video games on home consoles and as &quot;a fine cure for those days when you want a different kind of RTS to control&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 1999 scored it 9.75 out of 10, making it the magazine&#x27;s highest-rated Genesis game. Daniel Thomas of &quot;Sega-16&quot; gave it a score of 10 out of 10 in 2004, describing it as &quot;very probably the finest video game you&#x27;ve never played&quot; and as the Genesis console&#x27;s &quot;finest hour&quot;. Lawrence Wright of &quot;Insomnia&quot; gave the game a score of 5 out of 5 stars in 2008. GameSpot users have given &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; an average score of 8.8 out of 10 as of 2009.

It is often found on several &quot;best of...&quot; lists of video games, owing to its precedence in the real-time strategy genre, as well to the increasing understanding of finer points of its mechanics. It was featured in the &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot; list of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, in the November 1997 issue which ranked it at #43, and in the January 2002 issue which ranked it #52. The September 1996 issue of &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it the 31st best game of all time, and the February 1999 issue ranked it 39th best in both cases arguing that the strategic concept and level design were aped by more high-profile games like &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. It has been featured in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, in the 2003 list which ranked it at #62, and in the 2005 list which ranked it #95. In 2003, GameSpy listed the game as one of the 25 most underrated games of all time. 1UP.com included the game in its &quot;Essential 50&quot; list of &quot;The Most Important Games Ever Made&quot;. The U.S. game release packaging art was executed by veteran San Francisco game box illustrator Marc Ericksen, who had previously done the art for its sister game &quot;Thunder Force II&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The game concept of a central command and fighting vehicle directing other friendly units to attack remote enemy base appeared in past games, such as Sir Tech&#x27;s 1984 game &quot;Rescue Raiders&quot;. However, Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com states that the 1988 game &quot;Modem Wars&quot; was possibly &quot;[t]he closest predecessor&quot; to &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, but that it &quot;was fairly primitive and abstract by comparison&quot;, that earlier such games lacked the ability to construct units or manage resources which made them &quot;much more tactical than strategic&quot;, and that the slower processors made the ticks &quot;so long that the games were practically turn based&quot;. &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; (1997) and its spiritual successor &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; also inherit the concept of a large robotic command vehicle which is used to construct and command an army. Conversely, &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; and &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; are controlled in a similar fashion to traditional real-time strategy games; unlike in &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, the command vehicle in those games is mainly nothing more than a particularly powerful and versatile unit.

The producers of &quot;Dune II&quot; acknowledge &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; as an influence, as do the producers of &quot;Warcraft&quot; (1994), &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; (1995), &quot;StarCraft&quot; (1998), &quot;War of the Ring&quot; (2003), and &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; (2009). &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; is considered a predecessor to the MOBA subgenre, also known as action RTS, though a key difference is that &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; has a fully customizable command unit with role-playing video game elements that the player has full control over, while commanding an army to go into battle with rather than mindless drones that respawn at set intervals. The 2014 battle arena game &quot;AirMech&quot; is also inspired by &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;.

&quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; was re-released on Nintendo Switch as the final entry in the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; line of rereleases in Japan on August 27, 2020. It has online multiplayer, an interactive tutorial mode, widescreen with extra HUD support, difficulty options, and the ability to save replays.

&quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; was re-released for the Sega Genesis Mini 2 on October 27, 2022.

<doc id="842214" wikidata="Q1463932" url="?curid=842214" title="Mole people">
<text>In the United States, the term mole people (also called tunnel people or tunnel dwellers) is sometimes used to describe homeless people living under large cities in abandoned subway, railroad, flood, sewage tunnels, and heating shafts.

==In documentary film and non-fiction==
&quot;Dark Days&quot;, a 2000 documentary feature film by British filmmaker Marc Singer, follows a group of people living in an abandoned section of the New York City Subway, in the area called Freedom Tunnel. Anthropologist Teun Voeten&#x27;s book &quot;Tunnel People&quot; is also about the inhabitants of the Freedom Tunnel, where Voeten lived for five months.

Jennifer Toth&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City&quot;, written while she was an intern at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was promoted as a true account of travels in the tunnels and interviews with tunnel dwellers. The book helped canonize the image of the mole people as an ordered society living literally under people&#x27;s feet. However, few claims in her book have been verified, and it includes inaccurate geographical information, numerous factual errors, and an apparent reliance on largely unprovable statements. The strongest criticism came from New York City Subway historian Joseph Brennan, who declared, &quot;Every fact in this book that I can verify independently is wrong.&quot; Cecil Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; contacted Toth in 2004, and noted the large amount of unverifiability in her stories, while declaring that the book&#x27;s accounts seemed to be truthful. A later article, after contact with Brennan, was more skeptical of Toth&#x27;s truthfulness.

==Cities==
Other journalists have focused on the underground homeless in New York City as well. Photographer Margaret Morton made the photo book &quot;The Tunnel&quot;. Filmmaker Marc Singer made the documentary &quot;Dark Days&quot; in the year 2000, and a similar documentary, &quot;Voices in the Tunnels&quot;, was released in 2008. In 2010, Teun Voeten published &quot;Tunnel People&quot;.

===Las Vegas===
Media accounts have reported &quot;mole people&quot; living underneath other cities as well. In the Las Vegas Valley, it is estimated a thousand homeless people find shelter in the storm drains underneath the city for protection from extreme temperatures that exceeded in summer of 2024, while dropping below in winter.

According to media reports, the people living in the tunnels underneath Las Vegas have managed to furnish their &quot;rooms&quot;. In one ABC News report from 2009, a couple, who had been living in the tunnels for five years, had furnished their home with a bed, bookcase and even a makeshift shower. The tunnels are prone to flooding, which can be extremely dangerous for the tunnel&#x27;s residents. Most lose their belongings regularly, and there have been some reported deaths.

Many tunnel inhabitants have been turned away from the limited charities in Las Vegas. Matt O&#x27;Brien, a local author who spent nearly five years exploring life beneath the city to write the book &quot;Beneath the Neon&quot;, founded the Shine A Light Foundation to help the homeless people taking refuge in the tunnels. The charity helps tunnel residents by providing supplies, such as underwear, bottled water, and food.

According to the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, the valley has about of flood control channels and tunnels, and about of those are underground.

<text>The ACAZ T.1 and T.2, very similar to each other, were the first Belgian all-metal aircraft, flown in 1924. They were single-engined touring monoplanes which seated two. Only two were built.
==Development==

The first example of ACAZ&#x27;s all-metal two-seater tourer, registered as the ACAZ T.1 &quot;O-BAFK&quot;, was first flown in early 1924. It was the first Belgian all-metal aircraft. Its trials went well and on 21 June it was flown to Brussels to take part in the &quot;Concours des avions de tourisme&quot; (touring aircraft contest) but in low cloud it collided with a tree and crashed; happily, there were no deaths.

There is little detail recorded specifically on the T.1 apart from a photograph but its replacement, the ACAZ T.2, was noted as &quot;du même type&quot; (of the same type). It had made several successful flights by mid-July, just a few weeks after the crash of the T.1, though it was only registered as &quot;O-BAFM&quot; on 19 December 1924.

==Design==

The T.1 and T.2 were designed by Alfred Renard and Emile Allard. Each had a thick profile, two part, cantilever, high wing which could be rapidly detached for transport. In plan the wing was basically rectangular but with rounded leading edges at the tips. The wing was mounted with slight dihedral; its thickness was constant over most of the span but decreased over the outer parts, where its ailerons extended aft beyond the trailing edge.

The engine was a Anzani 6, a six-cylinder radial engine mounted uncowled on the nose with its fuel tank behind a firewall. The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section apart from a slightly shaped roof and was built around frames and longerons with sheet metal covering. The enclosed cabin, which held two sitting side-by-side, was under the wing and had both forward and side glazing. The fuselage frame in the cabin region was strengthened; access was via a side door. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a tailplane of the same plan as the wings, mounted on top of the fuselage. It carried broad, straight-edged elevators with a deep cut-out for movement of the tall, round-tipped rudder which was hinged from a small, triangular fin.

The fixed undercarriage had mainwheels with stub-axles on short, rigid duralumin tubes from the lower fuselage, giving a track of only . The tailskid was designed to double-up as a forward hook for transport as a trailer.

==Operational history==

Though &quot;O-BAFM&quot; remained on the registrar until 1933 there are few, if any, records of its activities in the French aviation press. No more T.2s were built, as no customers could be found.

<text>An elastomer is a polymer with viscoelasticity (i.e. both viscosity and elasticity) and with weak intermolecular forces, generally low Young&#x27;s modulus (E) and high failure strain compared with other materials. The term, a portmanteau of &quot;elastic polymer&quot;, is often used interchangeably with &quot;rubber&quot;, although the latter is preferred when referring to vulcanisates. Each of the monomers which link to form the polymer is usually a compound of several elements among carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and silicon. Elastomers are amorphous polymers maintained above their glass transition temperature, so that considerable molecular reconformation is feasible without breaking of covalent bonds. At ambient temperatures, such rubbers are thus relatively compliant (E ≈ 3 MPa) and deformable.


Rubber-like solids with elastic properties are called elastomers. Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak intermolecular bonds, which permit the polymers to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses.

Elastomers are usually thermosets (requiring vulcanization) but may also be thermoplastic (see thermoplastic elastomer). The long polymer chains cross-link during curing (i.e., vulcanizing). The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a &#x27;spaghetti and meatball&#x27; structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent cross-linkages ensure that the elastomer will return to its original configuration when the stress is removed.

Crosslinking most likely occurs in an equilibrated polymer without any solvent. The free energy expression derived from the Neohookean model of rubber elasticity is in terms of free energy change due to deformation per unit volume of the sample. The strand concentration, v, is the number of strands over the volume which does not depend on the overall size and shape of the elastomer. Beta relates the end-to-end distance of polymer strands across crosslinks over polymers that obey random walk statistics.

formula_1

formula_2

In the specific case of shear deformation, the elastomer besides abiding to the simplest model of rubber elasticity is also incompressible. For pure shear we relate the shear strain, to the extension ratios lambdas. Pure shear is a two-dimensional stress state making lambda equal to 1, reducing the energy strain function above to:

formula_3

To get shear stress, then the energy strain function is differentiated with respect to shear strain to get the shear modulus, G, times the shear strain:

formula_4 

Shear stress is then proportional to the shear strain even at large strains. Notice how a low shear modulus correlates to a low deformation strain energy density and vice versa. Shearing deformation in elastomers, require less energy to change shape than volume.

<text>Pâté ( , , ) is a forcemeat. Originally, the dish was cooked in a pastry case; in more recent times it is more usually cooked without pastry in a terrine. Various ingredients are used, which may include meat from pork, poultry, fish or beef; fat; vegetables; herbs; spices; wine; and brandy.

==History and etymology==
Both the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) date the term back to the 12th century. The former gives the original meaning as a &quot;culinary preparation consisting of minced meat or fish surrounded by dough and baked in the oven&quot;; the OED&#x27;s definition is &quot;a pie or pastry usually filled with finely minced meat, fish, vegetables, etc.&quot; The French words (pastry) and are both derived from the Latin meaning paste or dough (as is the English &quot;pastry&quot;). By the 19th century the pastry case was often dispensed with. According to &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;, when there is a pastry case the dish is and when there is not, and the mixture is cooked in a dish (called a ), it is , often abbreviated to or , terms used interchangeably in both French and English usage. A patty is a similar dish, and its name comes from a 19th-century English corruption of the French word pâté.

Pâté was known to the Romans, who generally made it with pork, although other main ingredients might include marinated and spiced birds&#x27; tongues. In the Middle Ages, there were numerous recipes for (meats – pork, poultry, game or fish – cooked in pastry).

Tinned pâté, being shelf-stable, has sometimes been included in military rations, for, among others, the French Armed Forces, whose rations have included tinned pâté for more than 100 years.

== Varieties ==
There are numerous varieties of French pâtés or terrines, including:
==Parfait==
Chicken liver is a subtype of pâté. Instead of first cooking the livers in butter, for a they are initially pureéd when raw and then passed through a sieve or put in a blender before being mixed with, typically, eggs, fortified wine, shallots, thyme, garlic and cognac and cooked in a until set. This allows for a smoother texture.

==Other countries==
In Central and Eastern Europe, pâté from liver is very popular and it is commonly known as &quot;pashtet&quot; (, &quot;pâté&quot;, ). Liver from other animals (such as cow) can also be used. The liver is first cooked (boiled or fried) and mixed with butter or fat and seasonings such as fresh or fried onions, carrots, spices, and herbs. It can be further cooked (usually baked), but most often used without any other preparation. In Russia, the pâté is served on a plate or in a bowl, and is typically moulded into the shapes of animals, such as hedgehogs.

In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, a similar recipe is known as chopped liver, with schmaltz used instead of butter and hard-boiled eggs frequently added. Another common type of pâté in Jewish cuisine, also popular in Russia and Ukraine, is , or &quot;gehakte herring&quot; (chopped herring). In Vietnamese cuisine, pâté is commonly used on &quot;baguette&quot;-type sandwiches.

<text>Florbela Espanca (; born , ) was a Portuguese poet. She is known for her passionate and feminist poetry. Fernando Pessoa later said she was his &quot;twin soul&quot;.

==Early life==
Born Flor Bela d&#x27;Alma da Conceição on 8 December 1894 in Vila Viçosa, Portugal, Espanca was the daughter of Antónia da Conceição Lobo who worked as a housemaid for Espanca&#x27;s father, João Maria Espanca, a photographer and businessman. Her father&#x27;s wife, Mariana do Carmo Inglesa Espanca, who was unable to have her own children, agreed for Espanca to live in their home, where she was raised from birth by both her father&#x27;s wife and her biological mother, who was 15 years old when Espanca was born. Since her parents weren&#x27;t married, when Espanca was baptized on 20 June 1895, she was christened as Flor Bela Lobo, the daughter of Antónia Lobo and an unknown father. Her father, whom Espanca referred to in a poem as &quot;dear Daddy of my soul&quot;, officially claimed paternity in 1949, 19 years after Espanca&#x27;s death.

Espanca&#x27;s full brother, Apeles Espanca, was born in 1897 and was also baptized as the child of an unknown father. In 1903, Espanca wrote her earliest known poem, &quot;A Vida e a Morte&quot; (Life and Death), when she was 8 years old. In 1908, her mother died at the age of 29 with &quot;neurosis&quot; recorded as her official cause of death. A few months after her mother&#x27;s death, Espanca became one of the first female students to enroll in the Liceu André de Gouveia, a traditionally male school in Évora, Portugal.

==Later life and career==

In 1913, Espanca failed a final examination and dropped out of school, and on her 19th birthday, she married Alberto Moutinho, a longtime friend and classmate. Espanca and Moutinho moved to Redondo, Portugal, where they both worked as teachers. Espanca taught French, English, geography, and history and Moutinho taught science. In 1915, due to financial difficulties, they moved in with Espanca&#x27;s father in Évora and continued teaching. From 1915 to 1917, she collected all of her poems into a work entitled &quot;O livro D&#x27;ele&quot; (His book) that she dedicated to her brother.

In 1916, Espanca re-enrolled in secondary school at the Liceu de Évora. After graduating in 1917, she and Moutinho moved to Lisbon so Espanca could attend the University of Lisbon, where she was one of seven women, out of a total of 313 students, enrolled in the School of Law. Six months later, Espanca had a miscarriage and took a temporary break from university in order to recover in the southern region of Algarve, away from the capital city of Lisbon. She had another miscarriage in 1919 and around the same time, Espanca began to show the first serious symptoms of mental illness. Later that same year, &quot;Livro de Mágoas&quot; (The Book of Sorrows) was published. In 1921 Espanca and Moutinho divorced, which exposed her to significant social prejudice.

She was remarried in 1922 to António Guimarães. Espanca had another miscarriage in 1923 and Guimarães filed for divorce a few months later. &quot;Livro de Soror Saudade&quot; (Sister Saudade&#x27;s Book) was published the same year. In 1925 she was married for a third time to Mário Lage, a doctor who had treated her for a long time. In the sonnet, &quot;Amar&quot; (Love), which was published in her last book, &quot;Charneca em Flor&quot; (Heath in Bloom), Espanca expressed a &quot;consuming desire to satisfy her need to love freely as a woman and her inability to channel that love into a socially acceptable, exclusive, monogamous mode,&quot; which according to Thomas Braga, was a revolutionary statement for Portuguese love sonnets.

Espanca&#x27;s brother died in an airplane accident (some believe he committed suicide, due to his fiancée&#x27;s death), which deeply affected her. His death inspired the writing of &quot;As Máscaras do Destino&quot; (The Masks of Destiny). After being diagnosed with pulmonary edema, Espanca starting keeping a diary and twice attempted suicide shortly before the completion of &quot;Charneca em Flor&quot;.

==Death and posthumous publications==
Espanca died by suicide on 8 December 1930, her 36th birthday, from an overdose of barbiturates. &quot;Charneca em Flor&quot; was published a month later in January 1931. In 1931, &quot;Reliquiare&quot;, a title given by the Italian professor Guido Battelli, was published with the poems she wrote on a further version of &quot;Charneca em Flor&quot;. A bilingual anthology of poems by Espanca was published as &quot;This Sorrow that Lifts Me Up&quot; in 2022, with translations by Simon Park and illustrations by Margarida Fleming.

<text>Affirming Catholicism, sometimes referred to as AffCath, is a movement operating in several provinces of the Anglican Communion, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and the United States. 

In the US the movement is known as Affirming Anglican Catholicism (AAC). The movement represents a liberal strand of Anglo-Catholicism and is particularly noted for holding that Anglo-Catholic belief and practice is compatible with the ordination of women. It also generally supports ordination into the threefold ministry (bishops, priests, deacons) regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

The movement was formalised on 9 June 1990 at St Alban&#x27;s Church, Holborn, in London by a number of Anglo-Catholic clergy in the Diocese of London who had been marginalised within, or expelled from, existing Anglo-Catholic groups because of their support for women&#x27;s ordination to the priesthood. It developed a theological stance which was staunchly liberal in matters of inclusivity but traditionally Catholic in matters of liturgy and the centrality and theology of the sacraments whilst believing that traditional restrictions on who may receive them should be re-examined.

In North America, AAC has ties with the Society of Catholic Priests; in the UK, AffCath is a partner organisation of Inclusive Church.

==Membership and support==
Prominent supporters include Rowan Williams, former archbishop of Canterbury; as well as Jeffrey John, former Dean of St Albans and former bishop suffragan-designate of Reading; both of whom have served on the executive committee of British and Irish Affirming Catholicism. In North America, bishops involved in AAC include Frank Griswold, former presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church; Andrew Hutchison, former primate of the Anglican Church of Canada; and Victoria Matthews, a bishop in Canada and New Zealand.
===Presidents===
The president of Affirming Catholicism is a bishop who acts as a figurehead for the movement.

*?–2011: David Stancliffe, Bishop of Salisbury
*2011–2014: Michael Perham, Bishop of Gloucester
*2015–present: Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of York

===Chairpersons===
Affirming Catholicism is governed by a board of directors and headed by a chairperson.

*1996 to ? John B. Gaskell
*2004–2007: Richard Jenkins
*2008–2012: Jonathan Clark
*2012–2018: Rosemarie Mallett

<doc id="842233" wikidata="Q4817908" url="?curid=842233" title="Tom Shales">
<text>Thomas William Shales (November 3, 1944 – January 13, 2024) was an American writer and television critic. 

He was a television critic for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 1977 to 2010, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1988. Shales also wrote a column for the television news trade publication &quot;NewsPro&quot;, published by Crain Communications.

==Early life and career==
Thomas William Shales was born in Elgin, Illinois, on November 3, 1944, to Clyde Shales (who had once been Elgin&#x27;s mayor) and Hulda Shales, and graduated from Elgin High School in 1962. He attended Elgin Community College before transferring to American University in Washington, D.C., where he earned a degree in journalism and was editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, &quot;The Eagle&quot;, for the 1966–1967 academic year, as well as the paper&#x27;s movie critic.

Shales&#x27;s first professional job was with radio station WRMN/WRMN-FM in Elgin at the age of 18. He served as the station&#x27;s disc jockey, local news reporter, writer and announcer, on both the AM and FM bands. He later worked with Voice of America as a producer of broadcasts to the Far East.

==Career==
Shales worked as entertainment editor at the &quot;D.C. Examiner&quot;, a tabloid newspaper, from 1968 to 1971. He joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a writer in the Style section in 1972, was named chief television critic in July 1977, and was appointed TV editor in June 1979. His reviews were syndicated in newspapers nationwide. By 2006, his combined income from his salary and his syndication earnings neared $400,000 a year.

Shales was known for his withering putdowns of shows he disliked, and was nicknamed &quot;Terrible Tom&quot; and &quot;the Terror of the Tube&quot;. His blunt style could polarize; &quot;Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994&quot; wrote: &quot;Forget the middle ground, Shales either loves it or hates it – and his reviews of TV shows and personalities are often unabashed paroxysms of that love or hate... Like the medium he covers, Shales turns out fast-paced and amusing fare that often lacks depth&quot;. His influence was such that shows he panned would sometimes include unflattering references to him as inside jokes. Shales called such barbs &quot;a TV critic&#x27;s only shot at immortality&quot;. 

His influence also extended to other critics. &quot;Daily Herald&quot; film critic Dann Gire who founded and served as president of the Chicago Film Critics Association, described him as setting a standard with writing that was &quot;incredibly funny, creative, inventive and smart&quot; and with a style more akin to a barroom discussion with readers than a lecture.

In 1988, Shales received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism for his work at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, including his coverage of the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings. From 1998 to 1999, he was a frequent film critic for &quot;Morning Edition&quot; on National Public Radio. He was a guest co-host on the television show &quot;Roger Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; after the death of Gene Siskel. Shales was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1991 to 1996.

In 2006, Shales ceased to be a staff writer for the &quot;Post&quot; and went on contract, where he remained until 2010, when he was laid off entirely by the newspaper. From 2012 to 2014, he wrote a column for RogerEbert.com.

===Books===
Shales published four books, including two he co-wrote with James Andrew Miller. In 2002, Shales and Miller published &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live&quot;, which covers the history of the sketch-comedy variety show, and provides a behind-the-scenes look at its stars and production process. The book was re-released in 2015 to coincide with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The updated edition contained over 100 pages of new material. 

In 2011, Shales and Miller published their second book together, &quot;Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN&quot;, which chronicles the history of the network ESPN from its infancy in 1979 through 2010. In 2015, Focus Features optioned the book to adapt it into a film.

==Death==
Shales died from COVID-19 and kidney failure at a hospital in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 13, 2024, at the age of 79.

<doc id="842236" wikidata="Q7826794" url="?curid=842236" title="Torque density">
<text>Torque density is a measure of the torque-carrying capability of a mechanical component. It is the ratio of torque capability to volume and is expressed in units of torque per volume.

Torque density is a system property since it depends on the design of each element of the component being examined and their interconnection.

While torque is a Pseudovector, volume only by definition exists in three Euclidean dimensions, must always be positive, and never can be negative.

==Examples and uses==

Torque density of magnetic gearboxes, wind turbines, magnetic trains, and mechanical trains are used to compare the energy efficiency of machines; 150 kilo-Newtons per cubic meter per stage is considered the highest attainable as of 2024.

Torque density is useful during the concept evaluation stage of mechanical designs, especially in power train design problems. Typically, it will be one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept. For example, in the upgrade of a drive train for a set of rolls in a rolling mill, space is often dictated by the configuration of current components. There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced. The relative torque densities of the devices may be an important determinant for which design is ultimately selected, although it will often compete with other factors such as cost, ease of maintenance, time to install, operating costs and potential failure modes.

==Units==
In SI units, torque density is expressed in joules per cubic metre or equivalently newton-metres per cubic metre.

Although dimensionally equivalent to the pascal, that is usually not used for this purpose.

Small amounts can be expressed in newton-millimetres per cubic millimetre. 

In U.S. customary units, torque density is expressed in foot-pounds force per cubic foot, or inch-pounds force per cubic inch or ounce-force inches per cubic inch.

<text>The ACAZ C.2, &quot;Ateliers de Construction Aeronautique de Zeebruge&quot;, was a prototype Belgian biplane fighter aircraft built in the 1920s.

==Design and development==
Built entirely of Duralumin metal, it was an advanced design at the time of its first flight in 1926, but although evaluated by the Belgian Air Force, no orders were placed. Of conventional biplane construction, the C.2, registered as &quot;O-BAFX&quot;, later &quot;OO-AFX&quot;, incorporated one unique feature - all four of its wings were identical and interchangeable. The aircraft also included space for cameras, allowing it to be used for photo-reconnaissance.

==Operational history==
Flown early in 1926 and evaluated by the Belgian &quot;Aéronautique&quot; &quot;Militaire&quot;, the C.2 tandem two-seat fighter-reconnaissance biplane was built by the &quot;Ateliers de Construction Aéronautique de Zeebrugge&quot; (A.C.A.Z.). Of all-metal construction, the C.2 was powered by a 450 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Ha 12-cylinder liquid-cooled engine, and an interesting feature was the interchangeability of all four main wing panels. The pilot and observer/gunner were seated in tandem and armament consisted of a single fixed forward-firing synchronized 7.7-mm Vickers machine gun and two Lewis guns of similar caliber on a flexible mount. No production order for the C.2 was placed by the &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;, and, on 03/09/1928, the sole prototype was employed for an attempt to fly to the Belgian Congo, this ending in a forced landing in France. The Aircraft was written off on 01/25/1933.

<text>Jennifer Ninel Toth (born August 15, 1967) is an American journalist and writer.

==Early life and education==
Toth was born in London to American parents Robert and Paula Toth. Her father was a national security correspondent for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and later a senior associate at the Pew Research Center, while her mother was a lawyer and special advocate for the state of Maryland. Toth grew up in Moscow and Chevy Chase, Maryland. She received her undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis before graduating from Columbia University with an M.A. in journalism.

==Career==
From 1990 to 1992, Toth worked as a journalist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in Washington, D.C. and New York, and afterwards for the Raleigh &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot;. Toth is married to Craig Whitlock, a journalist and national-security correspondent for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;.

In 1993, she published her study entitled &quot;The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City&quot;, featuring interviews with some dwellers of the &quot;Freedom Tunnel.&quot; Her life was threatened by one of the mole people whom she befriended, who thought she witnessed him killing a crack addict. She consequently fled New York City. The book, published by Chicago Review Press, became a worldwide best-seller, translated into Japanese, German, Italian, Spanish and Turkish.

Jim Dwyer, the author of &quot;Subway Lives&quot;, presented an influential review of &quot;The Mole People&quot; for the &quot;Washington&quot; Post on 25 October 1993. &quot;The wilder stories are overshadowed by the far simpler and far more touching portraits Toth presents of injured people struggling for dignity and tenderness,&quot; Dwyer wrote. &quot;Having aimed high, having strode beneath New York with a can of Mace from her father, and with a heart and head ready to listen, she has brought back a book of stories that no one else has told—a book that is honest and above all, loving, to people who are nobody&#x27;s friends. We should all do so well.&quot;

In 1997, Toth published &quot;Orphans of the Living: Stories of America&#x27;s Children in Foster Care&quot;, a book narrating the life stories of five young adults from North Carolina, California and Illinois who overcame heavy odds to survive their childhood in foster care. Publishers Weekly called it an &quot;eloquent and harrowing study,&quot; and &quot;an excellent expose of a system that hurts those it is charged to help.&quot;

Five years later, Toth released another narrative about a young man, &quot;What Happened to Johnnie Jordan: The Story of a Child Turning Violent,&quot; that once again pierced the secrecy surrounding foster care and juvenile services, this time in Toledo, Ohio. In its review, The New Yorker wrote: &quot;In accounts of dysfunctional families, children are often the victims of violence; here, though, a child is both victim and perpetrator. The child in question is Johnnie Jordan, a fifteen-year-old Ohioan who brutally murdered his foster mother in 1996, hacking her to death with a hatchet and then setting her on fire. Through a series of interviews with Jordan, his foster father, and others within the child-welfare system, Toth constructs an agonizing portrait of a boy who was repeatedly abused from a very young age and repeatedly failed by the system responsible for protecting him.&quot;

==Controversy==
Cecil Adams&#x27; &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, a widely read question and answer column, devoted two columns to the &quot;Mole People&quot; dispute. The first, published on 9 January 2004 after contact with Toth, noted the large amount of unverifiability in Toth&#x27;s stories while declaring that the book&#x27;s accounts seemed to be truthful. The second, published on 9 March 2004 after contact with Joseph Brennan, was more skeptical.

Documentation of the individuals and locations described in &quot;The Mole People&quot; have been repeatedly catalogued in a variety of other media, from photographer Margaret Morton&#x27;s &quot;The Tunnel&quot; (Yale University Press: 1995) to the &quot;New York Times&quot; to the &quot;Jerry Springer Show,&quot; which featured one of the main characters, Bernard Isaacs, the self-proclaimed Lord of the Tunnels.

<doc id="842245" wikidata="Q3078710" url="?curid=842245" title="Forward in Faith">
<text>Forward in Faith (FiF) is an organisation operating in the Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church. It represents a traditionalist strand of Anglo-Catholicism and is characterised by its opposition to the ordination of women to the priesthood and episcopate. It also takes a traditionalist line on other matters of doctrine. Credo Cymru is its counterpart in Wales. Forward in Faith North America (FIFNA) operates in the U.S.

==History==
FiF was formed in 1992 in response to approval by the General Synod of the Church of England of the ordination of women to the priesthood, initially an umbrella body for a number of Catholically oriented societies and campaigning groups. It became a membership organisation in 1994 and was registered as a charity in 1996. The traditionalist group in the Scottish Episcopal Church joined forces with Forward in Faith in 1997. Credo Cymru, the traditionalist body in the Church in Wales, established formal links with Forward in Faith in 2003; the two remain separate organisations.

For its first two decades, Forward in Faith&#x27;s main role was to campaign for provision by the Church of England for those of its members who would be unwilling to receive the ministry of women priests and the bishops who ordained them.

In 2000, FIF held a Mass to mark the turn of the millennium which filled the 10,000-capacity London Arena. The Eucharist was concelebrated by the Archbishop of York, David Hope, with more than 35 other bishops and 750 priests, and the preacher was the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres.

&quot;Consecrated Women&quot; (Canterbury Press, 2004), the report of a Forward in Faith working party, was published as a contribution to the debate on women in the episcopate. Its theological section was later republished, together with other material, in &quot;Fathers in God?&quot; (Canterbury Press, 2015).

Following the ordination of women to the episcopate, Forward in Faith&#x27;s main role is as the democratically structured membership organisation and registered charity which supports, finances and administers The Society under the patronage of S. Wilfrid and S. Hilda.

Especially in its early years, Forward in Faith had a number of Evangelical members, but today its membership is overwhelmingly Anglo-Catholic.

===Relations with the Roman Catholic Church===
In 2009, there were reports that Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vienna, had met with the Forward in Faith chairman, John Broadhurst, Anglican Bishop of Fulham, at the suggestion of the Pope.

On 20 October 2009, in a document called , the Holy See announced that its intention to create personal ordinariates for groups of former Anglicans within the Roman Catholic Church similar to the existing military ordinariates in that their jurisdiction is exercised on a personal basis rather than a territorial basis, as is the case with normal dioceses.

In October 2010, John Broadhurst announced his intention to join the Roman Catholic Church, although he said that he would not at that point resign as Chairman of Forward in Faith, saying &quot;it is not a Church of England organisation&quot;. He resigned from the position in November 2010 before being received into the Roman Catholic Church.

==Constitution==

Forward in Faith&#x27;s constitution is approved and amended by its national assembly, which elects the organisation&#x27;s officers and policy-making council. The executive committee (consisting of the officers and members elected or approved by the council) are the trustees of the charity. The organisation has branches in most Church of England dioceses.

==Leadership==

Chairman:
* John Broadhurst (to 2010); left when he became a Roman Catholic in 2010
* Jonathan Baker (2010 to 2014)
* Tony Robinson (2014 to 2023)
* Paul Thomas (2023 to present)

Director:
* Stephen Parkinson (1993 to 2012)
* Colin Podmore (2013 to 2020)
* Thomas Middleton (2020 to present)

==Forward in Faith North America==
Forward in Faith North America (FIFNA) is a separate organisation which is not structurally linked with Forward in Faith. It views itself to be the successor organisation to Coalition for the Apostolic Ministry, founded in the 1970s, the Evangelical and Catholic Mission, founded in 1976, and the Episcopal Synod of America, founded in 1989. FIFNA itself was founded in 1999.

FIFNA operates across the U.S. within several churches in the Anglican tradition, including the Reformed Episcopal Church, the Anglican Church in North America, the Diocese of the Holy Cross, the Anglican Mission in the Americas, the Anglican Province of America, the Anglican Church in America, and the Episcopal Church (United States).

FIFNA describes itself as:

a fellowship of Bishops, Clergy, Laity, Parishes, and Religious Orders who embrace the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who uphold the Evangelical Faith and Catholic Order which is the inheritance of the Anglican Way, and who work, pray and give for the reform and renewal of the Church. We are a teaching organism with a mission of teaching the catholic faith as received, practiced and passed on in the Anglican Communion.

<text>Aquilino Gomes Ribeiro, (; 13 September 1885 – 27 May 1963, Lisbon), was a Portuguese writer and diplomat. He is generally considered to be one of the great Portuguese novelists of the 20th century. In 1960, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature; having been nominated by the Sociedade Portuguesa de Escritores.

==Biography==
Born in Carregal de Tabosa, Sernancelhe, the natural son of Joaquim Francisco Ribeiro, a priest, and Mariana do Rosário Gomes, he had three older siblings: Maria do Rosário, Melchior and Joaquim. He was originally destined for the priesthood, but became involved with the Portuguese Republican Party in opposition to the Royal House of Braganza.

Although he did not participate directly, he was involved in the Lisbon Regicide and knew the plan and the assassins, as he stated in his work &quot;&quot;Um escritor confessa-se”&quot; (A Writer Confesses). Between 1908 and 1914, he lived between Paris and Berlin, cities where he broadened his horizons enormously.

In 1914, he returned to Portugal, after the start of World War I. By then, the Portuguese First Republic had been established.

He was later involved in opposition to António de Oliveira Salazar and the Estado Novo, whose government had moved to censor or ban several of his books.

He was married twice: in 1913 to Grete Tiedemann (ca. 1890-1927), a German, by whom he had a son, Aníbal Aquilino Fritz Tiedeman Ribeiro in 1914; then, in 1929, to Jerónima Dantas Machado, daughter of the deposed President of Portugal Bernardino Machado, by whom he had a son Aquilino Ribeiro Machado, in 1930, who became the 60th Mayor of Lisbon (1977–1979).

<text>Cassini Regio (adjective &quot;Cassinian&quot; ) is the enigmatic dark area that covers the leading half of Saturn&#x27;s moon Iapetus. It is named after Giovanni Cassini, the discoverer of Iapetus; &#x27;Regio&#x27; is a term used in planetary geology for a large area that is strongly differentiated in colour or albedo from its surroundings. The brighter half of Iapetus is composed of the Roncevaux Terra and the Saragossa Terra.

The nature of the material that caused the extensive discoloration of Cassini Regio is not known, but it appears to be quite thin. It may be the result of cryovolcanism, a spattering of material from outer moons, or residue left by the sublimation of brighter ice.

In December 2004 an image taken by the NASA &quot;Cassini&quot; probe revealed that a long ridge of high mountains runs down the centre of Cassini Regio, almost perfectly following Iapetus&#x27;s equator. The origin of this extremely unusual feature is as yet unknown.

&quot;Cassini&quot; completed a flyby of Iapetus in September 2007, and the images it has transmitted are helping to clarify the nature of Cassini Regio. For more details, see the main article on Iapetus.

<text>Roncevaux Terra is the name given to the northern part of the highly reflective side of Saturn&#x27;s moon Iapetus. The southern half of this side is named &quot;Saragossa Terra&quot;. The other half of Iapetus, named Cassini Regio, is extremely dark. It is believed that Roncevaux Terra&#x27;s colour is the underlying colour of Iapetus, while Cassini Regio was formed either by a substance that has covered up the brighter ice of the rest of the moon, or by a residue left from the sublimation of Roncevaux-type water ice.

Roncevaux Terra is named after the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, subject of the French epic poem the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, after whose characters the surface features of Iapetus are named.

<doc id="842268" wikidata="Q942417" url="?curid=842268" title="O-ring">
<text>An O-ring, also known as a packing or a toric joint, is a mechanical gasket in the shape of a torus; it is a loop of elastomer with a round cross-section, designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts, forming a seal at the interface.

The O-ring may be used in static applications or in dynamic applications where there is relative motion between the parts and the O-ring. Dynamic examples include rotating pump shafts and hydraulic cylinder pistons. Static applications of O-rings may include fluid or gas sealing applications in which: (1) the O-ring is compressed resulting in zero clearance, (2) the O-ring material is vulcanized solid such that it is impermeable to the fluid or gas, and (3) the O-ring material is resistant to degradation by the fluid or gas. The wide range of potential liquids and gases that need to be sealed has necessitated the development of a wide range of O-ring materials.

O-rings are one of the most common seals used in machine design because they are inexpensive, easy to make, reliable, and have simple mounting requirements. They have been tested to seal up to of pressure. The maximum recommended pressure of an O-ring seal depends on the seal hardness, material, cross-sectional diameter, and radial clearance.

==Manufacturing==
O-rings can be produced by extrusion, injection molding, pressure molding, or transfer molding.

==History==
The first patent for the O-ring is dated May 12, 1896, as a Swedish patent. J. O. Lundberg, the inventor of the O-ring, received the patent. The US patent for the O-ring was filed in 1937 by a then 72-year-old Danish-born machinist, Niels Christensen. In his previously filed application in 1933, resulting in Patent 2115383, he opens by saying, &quot;This invention relates to new and useful improvements in hydraulic brakes and more particularly to an improved seal for the pistons of power conveying cylinders.&quot; He describes &quot;a circular section ring... made of solid rubber or rubber composition&quot;, and explains, &quot;this sliding or partial rolling of the ring... kneads or works the material of the ring to keep it alive and pliable without deleterious effects of scuffing which are caused by purely static sliding of rubber upon a surface. By this slight turning or kneading action, the life of the ring is prolonged.&quot; His application filed in 1937 says that it &quot;is a continuation-in-part of my copending application Serial No. 704,463 for Hydraulic brakes, filed December 29, 1933, now U. S. Patent No. 2,115,383 granted April 26, 1938&quot;.

Soon after migrating to the United States in 1891, he patented an air brake system for streetcars (trams). Despite his legal efforts, the patents were passed from company to company until they ended up at Westinghouse. During World War II, the US government commandeered the O-ring patent as a critical war-related item and gave the right to manufacture to other organizations. Christensen received a lump sum payment of US$75,000 for his efforts. Litigation resulted in a $100,000 payment to his heirs in 1971, 19 years after his death.

==Theory and design==
O-rings are available in various metric and inch standard sizes. Sizes are specified by the inside diameter and the cross section diameter (thickness). In the US the most common standard inch sizes are per SAE AS568C specification (e.g. AS568-214). ISO 3601-1:2012 contains the most commonly used standard sizes, both inch and metric, worldwide. The UK also has standards sizes known as BS sizes, typically ranging from BS001 to BS932. Several other size specifications also exist.

===Typical applications===
Successful O-ring joint design requires a rigid mechanical mounting that applies a predictable deformation to the O-ring. This introduces a calculated mechanical stress at the O-ring contacting surfaces. As long as the pressure of the fluid being contained does not exceed the contact stress of the O-ring, leaking cannot occur. The pressure of the contained fluid transfers through the essentially incompressible O-ring material, and the contact stress rises with increasing pressure. For this reason, an O-ring can easily seal high pressure as long as it does not fail mechanically. The most common failure is extrusion through the mating parts.

The seal is designed to have a point contact between the O-ring and sealing faces. This allows a high local stress, able to contain high pressure, without exceeding the yield stress of the O-ring body. The flexible nature of O-ring materials accommodates imperfections in the mounting parts. But it is still important to maintain good surface finish of those mating parts, especially at low temperatures where the seal rubber reaches its glass transition temperature and becomes increasingly inflexible and glassy. Surface finish is also especially important in dynamic applications. A surface finish that is too rough will abrade the surface of the O-ring, and a surface that is too smooth will not allow the seal to be adequately lubricated by a fluid film.

===Vacuum applications===
In vacuum applications, the permeability of the material renders the point contacts unusable. Instead, higher mounting forces are used and the ring fills the whole groove. Also, round back-up rings are used to save the ring from excessive deformation.

Because the ring is subject to the ambient pressure and the partial pressure of gases only at the seal, their gradients will be steep near the seal and shallow in the bulk (opposite to the gradient of the contact stress (&quot;See Vacuum flange#KF.2FQF.&quot;) High-vacuum systems below 10−9 Torr use copper or nickel O-rings. Also, vacuum systems that have to be immersed in liquid nitrogen use indium O-rings, because rubber becomes hard and brittle at low temperatures.

===High temperature applications===
In some high-temperature applications, O-rings may need to be mounted in a tangentially compressed state, to compensate for the Gow-Joule effect.

==Sizes==
O-rings come in a variety of sizes. Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Aerospace Standard 568 (AS568) specifies the inside diameters, cross-sections, tolerances, and size identification codes (dash numbers) for O-rings used in sealing applications and for straight thread tube fitting boss gaskets. British Standard (BS) which are imperial sizes or metric sizes.
Typical dimensions of an O-ring are internal dimension (id), outer dimension (od), and thickness / cross section (cs)

Metric O-rings are usually defined by the internal dimension x the cross section. Typical part number for a metric O-ring - ID x CS [material &amp; shore hardness] 2x1N70=defines this O-ring as 2mm id with 1mm cross section made from Nitrile rubber which is 70Sh. BS O-rings are defined by a standard reference.

The World&#x27;s Largest O-ring was produced in a successful Guinness World Record attempt by Trelleborg Sealing Solutions Tewkesbury partnered with a group of 20 students from Tewkesbury School. The O-ring once finished and placed around the Medieval Tewkesbury Abbey had a circumference, an approximately inner diameter, and a cross section of .

==Material==

O-ring selection is based on chemical compatibility, application temperature, sealing pressure, lubrication requirements, durometer, size, and cost.

Synthetic rubbers - Thermosets:
* Butadiene rubber (BR)
* Butyl rubber (IIR)
* Chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM)
* Epichlorohydrin rubber (ECH, ECO)
* Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM): good resistance to hot water and steam, detergents, caustic potash solutions, sodium hydroxide solutions, silicone oils and greases, many polar solvents, and many diluted acids and chemicals. Special formulations are excellent for use with glycol-based brake fluids. Unsuitable for use with mineral oil products: lubricants, oils, or fuels. Peroxide-cured compounds are suitable for higher temperatures.
* Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR)
* Fluoroelastomer (FKM): noted for their very high resistance to heat and a wide variety of chemicals. Other key benefits include excellent resistance to aging and ozone, very low gas permeability, and the fact that the materials are self-extinguishing. Standard FKM materials have excellent resistance to mineral oils and greases, aliphatic, aromatic, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels, non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD), and many organic solvents and chemicals. Generally not resistant to hot water, steam, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids, and low molecular weight organic acids. In addition to the standard FKM materials, a number of specialty materials with different monomer compositions and fluorine content (65% to 71%) are available that offer improved chemical or temperature resistance and/or better low temperature performance.
* Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN, Buna-N): a common material for o-rings because of its good mechanical properties, its resistance to lubricants and greases, and its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are determined by the acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited resistance to oils and fuels. As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the resistance to oils and fuels improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance, and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based lubricants and greases, many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils and greases, and water to about . NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high aromatic content, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids, and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD). NBR also has low resistance to ozone, weathering, and aging. HNBR has considerable improvement of the resistance to heat, ozone, and aging, and gives it good mechanical properties.
* Perfluoroelastomer (FFKM)
* Polyacrylate rubber (ACM)
* Polychloroprene (neoprene) (CR)
* Polyisoprene (IR)
* Polysulfide rubber (PSR)
* Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
* Sanifluor (FEPM)
* Silicone rubber (SiR): noted for their ability to be used over a wide temperature range and for excellent resistance to ozone, weathering, and aging. Compared with most other sealing elastomers, the physical properties of silicones are poor. Generally, silicone materials are physiologically harmless so they are commonly used by the food and drug industries. Standard silicones are resistant to water up to , aliphatic engine and transmission oils, and animal and plant oils and fats. Silicones are generally not resistant to fuels, aromatic mineral oils, steam (short term to is possible), silicone oils and greases, acids, or alkalis. Fluorosilicone elastomers are far more resistant to oils and fuels. The temperature range of applications is somewhat more restricted.
* Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR)

Thermoplastics:
* Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) styrenics
* Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) LDPE, HDPE, LLDPE, ULDPE
* Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polyether, polyester: Polyurethanes differ from classic elastomers in that they have much better mechanical properties. In particular they have a high resistance to abrasion, wear, and extrusion, a high tensile strength, and excellent tear resistance. Polyurethanes are generally resistant to aging and ozone, mineral oils and greases, silicone oils and greases, nonflammable hydraulic fluids HFA &amp; HFB, water up to , and aliphatic hydrocarbons.
* Thermoplastic etheresterelastomers (TEEEs) copolyesters
* Thermoplastic polyamide (PEBA) Polyamides
* Melt Processible Rubber (MPR)
* Thermoplastic Vulcanizate (TPV)

Chemical compatibility:
* Air, – Silicone

* Chlorine Water – Viton (FKM)
* Gasoline – Buna-N or Viton (FKM)
* Hydraulic Oil (Petroleum Base, Industrial) – Buna-N
* Hydraulic Oils (Synthetic Base) – Viton
* Water – EPDM
* Motor Oils – Buna-N

==Other seals==
Although the O-ring was originally so named because of its circular cross section, there are now variations in cross-section design. The shape can have different profiles, such as an x-shaped profile, commonly called the X-ring, Q-ring, or by the trademarked name Quad Ring. When squeezed upon installation, they seal with 4 contact surfaces—2 small contact surfaces on the top and bottom. This contrasts with the standard O-ring&#x27;s comparatively larger single contact surfaces top and bottom. X-rings are most commonly used in reciprocating applications, where they provide reduced running and breakout friction and reduced risk of spiraling when compared to O-rings.

There are also rings with a square profile, commonly called square-cuts, lathe cuts, tabular cut, or square rings. When O-rings were selling at a premium because of the novelty, lack of efficient manufacturing processes, and high labor content, square rings were introduced as an economical substitution for O-rings. The square ring is typically manufactured by molding an elastomer sleeve which is then lathe-cut. This style of seal is sometimes less expensive to manufacture with certain materials and molding technologies (compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding), especially in low volumes. The physical sealing performance of square rings in static applications is superior to that of O-rings, however in dynamic applications it is inferior to that of O-rings. Square rings are usually used only in dynamic applications as energizers in cap seal assemblies. Square rings can also be more difficult to install than O-rings.

Similar devices with a non-round cross-sections are called seals, packings, or gaskets. See also Washer (hardware).

Automotive cylinder heads are typically sealed by flat gaskets faced with copper.

Knife edges pressed into copper gaskets are used for high vacuum.

Elastomers or soft metals that solidify in place are used as seals.

==Failure modes==
O-ring materials may be subjected to high or low temperatures, chemical attack, vibration, abrasion, and movement. Elastomers are selected according to the situation.

There are O-ring materials which can tolerate temperatures as low as or as high as . At the low end, nearly all engineering materials become rigid and fail to seal; at the high end, the materials often burn or decompose. Chemical attack can degrade the material, start brittle cracks or cause it to swell. For example, NBR seals can crack when exposed to ozone gas at very low concentrations, unless protected. Swelling by contact with a low viscosity fluid causes an increase in dimensions, and also lowers the tensile strength of the rubber. Other failures can be caused by using the wrong size of ring for a specific recess, which may cause extrusion of the rubber.

Elastomers are sensitive to ionizing radiation. In typical applications, O-rings are well-protected from less-penetrating radiation such as ultraviolet and soft X-rays, but more-penetrating radiation such as neutrons may cause rapid deterioration. In such environments, soft metal seals are used.

There are a few common reasons for O-ring failure:
#Installation damageThis is caused by improper installation of the O-ring.
#Spiral failureFound on long-stroke piston seals and – to a lesser degree – on rod seals. The seal gets &quot;hung up&quot; at one point on its diameter (against the cylinder wall) and slides and rolls at the same time. This twists the O-ring as the sealed device is cycled and finally causes a series of deep spiral cuts (typically at a 45-degree angle) on the surface of the seal.
#Explosive decompressionAn O-ring embolism, also called gas expansion rupture, occurs when high pressure gas becomes trapped inside the elastomeric seal element. This expansion causes blisters and ruptures on the surface of the seal.

==Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster==

The failure of an O-ring seal was determined to be the cause of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster on January 28, 1986. A crucial factor was cold weather prior to the launch. This was famously demonstrated on television by Caltech physics professor Richard Feynman, when he placed a small O-ring into ice-cold water, and subsequently showed its loss of flexibility before an investigative committee.

The material of the failed O-ring was FKM, which was specified by the shuttle motor contractor, Morton-Thiokol. When an O-ring is cooled below its glass transition temperature Tg, it loses its elasticity and becomes brittle. More importantly, when an O-ring is cooled near (but not beyond) its Tg, the cold O-ring, once compressed, will take longer than normal to return to its original shape. O-rings (and all other seals) work by producing positive pressure against a surface, thereby preventing leaks. On the night before the launch, exceedingly low air temperatures were recorded. Due to this, NASA technicians performed an inspection; the ambient temperature was within launch parameters, and the launch sequence was allowed to proceed. However, the temperature of the rubber O-rings remained significantly lower than that of the surrounding air. During his investigation of the launch footage, Feynman observed a small out-gassing event from the Solid Rocket Booster at the joint between two segments in the moments immediately preceding the disaster. This was blamed on a failed O-ring seal. The escaping high-temperature gas impinged upon the external tank, and the entire vehicle was destroyed as a result.

Since the accident, rubber production companies have enacted changes. Many O-rings now come with batch and cure-date coding, as is done in medicine production, to precisely track and control distribution. For aerospace and military applications, O-rings are usually individually packaged and labeled with the material, cure date, and batch information. O-rings can, if needed, be recalled off the shelf. Furthermore, O-rings and other seals are routinely batch-tested for quality control by the manufacturers, and often undergo quality assurance testing several more times by the distributor and ultimate end-users.

As for the boosters themselves, NASA and Morton-Thiokol redesigned them with a new joint design, which now incorporated three O-rings instead of two, with the joints themselves having onboard heaters that can be turned on when temperatures drop below . No O-ring issues have occurred since &quot;Challenger&quot;, and they did not play a role in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster of 2003.

<text>The ORACLE or &quot;Oak Ridge Automatic Computer and Logical Engine&quot;, an early computer built by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was based on the IAS architecture developed by John von Neumann.

== Summary ==

The &quot;Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review&quot; states:

[Oak Ridge National] Laboratory engineers assisted Argonne [National Laboratory] during the early 1950s in design and fabrication of the Oak Ridge Automatic Computer and Logical Engine. Its name was selected with reference to a lyrical acronym from Greek mythology—ORACLE, defined as &#x27;a shrine in which a deity reveals hidden knowledge.&#x27;

Assembled before the development of transistors and microchips, the ORACLE was a large scientific digital computer that used vacuum tubes. It had an original storage capacity of 1024 words of 40 bits each (later doubled to 2048 words). The computer also contained a magnetic-tape auxiliary memory and an on-line cathode-tube plotter, a recorder, and a typewriter. Operational in 1954, for a time the ORACLE had the fastest speed and largest data storage capacity of any computer in the world. Problems that would have required two mathematicians with electric calculators three years to solve could be done on the ORACLE in 20 minutes.

[Alston] Householder and the Mathematics Panel used the ORACLE to analyze radiation and shielding problems. In 1957, Hezz Stringfield and Ward Foster, both of the Budget Office, also adopted the ORACLE for more mundane but equally important tasks—annual budgeting and monthly financial accounting. As one of the last &#x27;homemade computers,&#x27; the ORACLE became obsolete by the 1960s. The Laboratory then purchased or leased its mainframe computers from commercial suppliers. From the initial applications of the ORACLE to nuclear aircraft problems, computer enthusiasm spread like lightning throughout the Laboratory, and in time, use of the machines became common in all the Laboratory&#x27;s divisions.
ORACLE was operational (passed acceptance test) in 1953, and replaced the USAF-Fairchild Computer (or &quot;SPEC&quot; - Special Purpose Electronic Computer).

As with all computers of its era, the ORACLE computer was a one-of-a-kind machine that could not exchange programs with other computers (even other IAS machines). It used vacuum tubes, transistors, and diodes. It used a Williams tube for 2048 words of memory. Its addition time was 70 microseconds, the multiplication time was 370-590 microseconds, and the division time was 590 microseconds. These times include the storage access time, which was about 62 microseconds.

The ORACLE pre-dated input from disks and the use of punch cards with computers; it used paper tape for input and breakage of the tape was a frequent problem.

<text>Alessandro Tassoni (28 September 156525 April 1635) was an Italian poet and writer, from Modena, best known as the author of the mock-heroic poem &quot;La secchia rapita&quot; (&quot;The Rape of the Pail&quot;, or &quot;The stolen bucket&quot;).

== Life ==
He was born in Modena, to a noble family, from Bernardino Tassoni and Sigismonda Pellicciari. Having lost both parents at an early age, he was raised by the maternal grandfather, Giovanni Pellicciari. It was with Giovanni that, according to tradition, he first visited the bucket, which was later to inspire his major work, in the belfry of Modena&#x27;s Cathedral.

At the age of 13, Alessandro Tassoni was taught Greek and Latin by Lazzaro Labadini, a professor of Literature at the University.

He then became a law student, attending university in Modena, then in Bologna, Pisa and Ferrara, where he eventually graduated. He appears to have been a rowdy youth, living for some time in Nonantola, from where he was expelled in 1595, due to several incidents in which Tassoni had been involved as a member of a local street gang.

In 1597, he began his service for the cardinal Ascanio Colonna whom he followed to Spain. 
In 1589 he was elected to the Accademia della Crusca. In 1603, he was back in Italy and moved to Rome.

In 1612 he published anonymously the booklet &quot;Le Filippiche&quot; in which he attacked the Spanish domination of parts of the Italian peninsula. Though he always denied having written it (probably for fear of Spanish retaliation), the work became famous enough to ingratiate Tassoni to the Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, who, in 1618 hired him in Turin with the title of &quot;first secretary&quot;.

After this, Tassoni was with the cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi in 1626 and served under Francesco I d&#x27;Este, duke of Modena, in 1635.

He died in Modena. His fellow citizens remembered his life and work with a statue that can still be seen in front of the town symbol, the Ghirlandina.

== Work ==
Besides the above-mentioned &quot;Filippiche&quot;, Tassoni is known for other works, some of poetry and some of literary criticism. The latter includes the (&quot;Diverse meditations by Alessandro Tassoni&quot;), and (1609), a piece of criticism showing independence of traditional views. However, Tassoni is best known as the author of the mock-heroic poem &quot;La secchia rapita&quot; (&quot;The Rape of the Pail&quot;, or &quot;The stolen bucket&quot;); it is by virtue of this work that he is remembered as Modena&#x27;s poet laureate.

=== &quot;La secchia rapita&quot; ===

&quot;La secchia rapita&quot; was written by Tassoni between 1614 and 1615 and first published in Paris in 1622. It was not to be published in Italy until Tassoni modified it slightly to accommodate the censorship of the Catholic Church. Tassoni paid for the first Italian edition, bearing his own name, in 1624 (the poem had been previously circulated under the pseudonym of &quot;Aldrovinci Melisone&quot;). The final edition was published in 1630.

The poem is loosely based on a war originating from the battle of Zappolino fought between Modena and Bologna in 1325. Most of the events reported in the poem are completely fictitious, even incorporating in the war the battle of Fossalta which had been fought almost a hundred years before. The central episode, in which the Modenese steal a bucket from their rivals, is not reported by the main contemporary historians, however a bucket, purported to be that very trophy, has been on display, in the basement of the Torre della Ghirlandina, from the times of the battle to present.

In the poem, the theft of the bucket results in the eruption of an extremely complicated war, where even the Olympian gods take part (this is in the tradition of classical poems such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad) and is eventually resolved by the intervention of the Pope.

The narration is dotted by references to situations and persons contemporary to the author, and with farcical appearances such as the &quot;Conte di Culagna&quot; (Count of Ass-land) probably the best known character of the book. In the third chapter of the poem, armies from all over the country arrive to take part in the war, and the Conte of Culagna makes his first appearance:
(*)The feathers recall the peacock and its vanity, the horns are the traditional symbol of the cuckold.

&quot;La secchia rapita&quot; was immensely popular both in Italy and abroad. While Marino&#x27;s influence was fading, Tassoni&#x27;s comic poem opened the way for the works of his epigones: &quot;L&#x27;Eneide travestita&quot; (1634), a parody by Giovanni Battista Lalli, imitated in the &quot;Virgile travesti&quot; by Paul Scarron, &quot;Il Malmantile racquistato&quot; by Lorenzo Lippi (1676) and several others.

<text>The Rotax Max 125 Engine is a two-stroke engine designed by Rotax, part of Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP), to provide cost-effective but high speed kart racing. Built in Austria, the engine is liquid cooled, equipped with a balance shaft, integrated water pump, electric starter and centrifugal clutch. Its combination of onboard electric starter and centrifugal clutch simplifies its operation. This concept is called TaG (Touch-and-go).

The Rotax Max was introduced to karting in 1998, easy to use and very reliable, it almost immediately began to gain market share from other slower or more expensive classes. The engine is offered in different performance configurations.

== Engine versions ==
There are several different versions of the engine. The original has a power valve and produces around , and is used by racers aged 15 or older. The DD2 is another fully powered version which has two gears and is direct drive in that the axle goes through the engine without need for a chain.

125 MAX EVO &quot;base&quot; configuration:
* at 11,500 rpm
*Maximum rpm 14,800 rpm.
* recommended as of 14 years (13 years if the driver turns 14 in the season) 
* has a cylinder with exhaust valve

125 Junior MAX configuration: 
* at 8,500 rpm
*Maximum rpm 14,800 rpm
* recommended as of 12 years (11 years if the driver turns 12 in the season) 
* has a cylinder without exhaust valve

125 Mini MAX engine configuration:
* at 8,500 rpm
*Maximum rpm 12,500 rpm
* recommended for children from 10 to 13 years
* has a cylinder without exhaust valve, and intake and exhaust restrictors

125 Micro MAX engine configuration:
* at 6,500 rpm
*Maximum rpm 12,000 rpm
* recommended for kids from 8 to 10 years

<text>is a form of Japanese street theater and storytelling that was popular during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the postwar period in Japan until the advent of television during the mid-20th century. were performed by a (&quot; narrator&quot;) who travelled to street corners with sets of illustrated boards that they placed in a miniature stage-like device and narrated the story by changing each image.

 has its earliest origins in Japanese Buddhist temples, where Buddhist monks from the 8th century onward used (&quot;picture scrolls&quot;) as pictorial aids for recounting their history of the monasteries, an early combination of picture and text to convey a story.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The exact origins of during the 20th century are unknown, appearing &quot;like the wind on a street corner&quot; in the Shitamachi section of Tokyo around 1930. It is believed, however, that has deep roots in Japan&#x27;s (&quot;pictorial storytelling&quot;) art history, which can be traced back to the 12th-century scrolls, such as the (&quot;Frolicking Critters&quot;), attributed to the priest Toba Sōjō (1053–1140). The scroll depicts anthropomorphised animal caricatures that satirise society during this period but has no text, making it a pictorial aid to a story. It can therefore be considered a direct precursor of .

During the Edo period (1603–1868), visual and performing arts flourished, particularly through the proliferation of ukiyo-e (&quot;pictures of the floating world&quot;). once again became popular during the later 18th century as storytellers began to set up on street corners with an unrolled scroll hanging from a pole. In the Meiji period (1868–1912), (&quot;stand-up pictures&quot;), similar to those in the Edo period, were told by performers who manipulated flat paper cutouts of figures mounted on wooden poles (similar to the shadow puppets of Indonesia and Malaysia). The Zen priest Nishimura is also credited to have used these pictures during sermons to entertain children. Another form of was the Japanese-modified stereoscope imported from the Netherlands. Much smaller in size, six engravings of landscapes and everyday scenes would be placed one behind the other on top of the device and lowered when required so that the viewer, who looked at them through a lens, could experience the illusion of space created by this device. The artistic and technological developments of the Edo and Meiji periods can be linked to the establishment of .

=== Golden age ===
, cartoons, and comics became substantially popular during the Great Depression of the 1930s and after the Japanese surrender to the Allied Forces in August 1945 at the end of the Second World War. This period is known as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of in Japan. produced and narrated over this period give insight into the minds of the people who lived through such a tumultuous period in history. Contrary to the hardships imposed by the Depression, in 1933 there were 2,500 in Tokyo alone, who performed ten times a day for audiences of up to thirty children, equalling a total of one million children a day. The Depression years were the most prosperous and vibrant for : with 1.5 million unemployed in Tokyo in 1930, it provided a great job opportunity for many people.

The early postwar period was particularly hard on the citizens of Japan who wanted to rebuild their lives in a rapidly changing environment. Comics became popular in newspapers and magazines, depicting scenes of everyday life injected with humour. A strong publishing industry emerged from the demand for comics, but outside of this industry, the desire for cheap entertainment further stimulated the demand for . Five million children and adults were entertained across Japan daily during the postwar period.
The (&quot;street-corner storyteller&quot;) parked their bicycle at a familiar intersection and banged their (&quot;clapping sticks&quot;) together to announce their presence and create anticipation for the show. When the audience arrived they would sell sweets to the children as a fee for the show, which was their main source of income. They would then unfold a , a miniature wooden proscenium which held the illustrated boards for the narrator to change as he narrated (and provided sound effects for) the unscripted story. True artists only used hand-painted original art, not the mass-produced kind found in schools or for other communication purposes.

 (dealers) were sought to commission and rent artwork to narrators for a small fee. The creation of these boards was similar to that of an American comic book company, with each person separately doing the colouring of a panel. The principal illustrator would make pencil sketches that were then done over with thick brushes of India ink. Watercolour paint was then applied to delineate the background and foreground, an opaque tempera paint was then added on top and lastly a coat of lacquer to give it shine and protect it from the elements. A mix of &quot;trashy pop culture&quot; and fine artistry, blended the traditional linear style of Japanese painting with the heavy chiaroscuro of Western painting, contrasting light and dark to give the figures depth and dynamism.

There were a variety of popular stories and themes in , which are now seen in contemporary manga and anime, including one of the first illustrated costume superheroes in the world, (&quot;Golden Bat&quot;) in 1931, superheroes with secret identities like Prince Ganma (whose alter ego was a street urchin) and the popular genre of or &quot;drama pictures&quot;. Many prolific manga artists, like Shigeru Mizuki and Sanpei Shirato, were once artists before the medium went out of vogue in 1953.
 was also utilized as a source of communication to the masses, an &quot;evening news&quot; for adults during the Second World War and the Allied Occupation (1945–1953). There are theories about the acceptance of drawing as a means to communicate in Asian nations more so than in Western nations which can be linked to the different printing technologies utilized in each regions histories. In the West, text and image eventually became separated because of the Gutenberg method of moveable type. It was much easier to employ woodblock printing to depict the complex characters of the Japanese language. Such use was often related to propaganda.

=== Decline ===
The popularity of declined at the end of the Allied Occupation and the introduction of television, known originally as (&quot;electric &quot;) in 1953. With television bringing larger access to a variety of entertainment, many artists and narrators lost their work, with the former turning to drawing , bringing new talent and narrative to this growing genre. Although this Japanese art form has largely disappeared, its significance and contributions have allowed to be attributed as an origin for manga.

==Modern usage==
As part of the Toyota Production System, boards are used as a visual control for performing audits within a manufacturing process. A series of cards are placed on a board and selected at random or according to schedule by supervisors and managers of the area. This ensures safety and cleanliness of the workplace is maintained and that quality checks are being performed.

, storytelling was being conducted as part of an ongoing campaign to promote world peace. Maki Saji (a Buddhist nun) created a based on the story of one of the many children, Sadako Sasaki, who suffered as a result of the atomic bomb raid on Hiroshima in 1945. In May 2010, she was a delegate at a Meeting of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the United Nations in New York, where she performed to promote a world in harmony and free of nuclear arms. 

A number of manga and anime have been produced that borrow from or call back to tropes and presentation. These include , an manga by Suehiro Maruo based around the titular character archetype, and , an anime that uses a style to tell myths and urban legends. Additionally, some older works that would later become popular manga or anime, such as &quot;GeGeGe no Kitaro&quot;, originally started as programs.

<doc id="842294" wikidata="Q1931492" url="?curid=842294" title="Rancid (1993 album)">
<text>Rancid is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid. It was released on May 10, 1993, through Epitaph Records.

It is the only album to feature the band as a trio (guitarist/vocalist Lars Frederiksen would later join the band for the album&#x27;s supporting tour), as well as one of three albums not to be produced by Brett Gurewitz (the others being &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; and &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;). However, Gurewitz provided backing vocals on the album.

It was also the second of three self-titled releases, the others being the group&#x27;s debut extended play (1992) and its fifth studio album (2000). This album has been dubbed &quot;Rancid Rancid.&quot;
Until 2017&#x27;s &quot;Trouble Maker&quot;, this was the only Rancid album not to feature their iconic logo on the cover. In 2019, the Brooklyn Vegan ranked the album as their 6th best album.

==Reception==
Mike DaRonco of AllMusic stated &quot;This is where it all starts. Without any reminiscing about their former band, Operation Ivy, Matt Freeman (bass) and Tim Armstrong (guitar/vocals) blast through their debut without any hints of ska or blatant Clash plagiarizing. On the contrary, this album rips through 15 tracks of high-energy punk that&#x27;s accompanied by heavy bass leads and Armstrong&#x27;s permanently slurred vocals. And to top it all off, the lyrical content deals with urban blight and the lifestyle of being a public nuisance. With this trademark sound, Rancid provide the perfect soundtrack for any car chase that includes massive property damage; is it a wonder MTV wouldn&#x27;t touch this?&quot;

==Track listing==

* &quot;Union Blood&quot;, the album&#x27;s fifteenth track, is a hidden track and not mentioned on the back cover.
* &quot;Get Out of My Way&quot;, the album&#x27;s final song, is a cover, originally performed by The Uptones.
* The album insert thanks Lars Frederiksen, who joined the band prior to &quot;Rancid&quot;&#x27;s release. As such, out of respect to what they had done before him and so not as to take any credit for it, he does not appear in the liner notes for the album.
* The album thanks Billie Joe Armstrong and his band Green Day. Billie Joe Armstrong would later co-write the song &quot;Radio&quot;, which is featured on Rancid&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;.
* The album also thanks Buzz Osborne and Lori Black of the Melvins.
* The album also thanks The Offspring and NOFX, who were both labelmates with Rancid and would tour and achieve success together.
* Bad Religion members Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley make a guest appearance on the album. Brett is the owner of the album&#x27;s label Epitaph and would produce and engineer their later albums.
* The album thanks Tom Radner, Tony &quot;Blue Shorts&quot; Villis, and Robb Flynn and his band Machine Head as Rob Machinehead. Rancid was also thanked in the booklet of Machine Head&#x27;s 1994 debut &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot;.
* The tracks &quot;Adina&quot; and &quot;The Bottle&quot; were featured in the Adam Rifkin film &quot;The Chase&quot; in 1994.

<text>King Mswati II (c. 1820 – August 1868), also known as Mswati and Mavuso III, was the king of Eswatini between 1840 and 1868. He was also the eponym of Eswatini. Mswati is considered to be one of the greatest fighting kings of Eswatini. 

Under his kingship, the territorial boundaries of Eswatini were greatly increased. Mswati was the son of Sobhuza I and Tsandzile Ndwandwe (known as &quot;LaZidze&quot;) who after ruling as Queen Mother became Queen Regent after the death of her son. After the death of Sobhuza, Mswati inherited an area which extended as far as present day Barberton in the north and included the Nomahasha district in the Portuguese territory of Mozambique. 

Mswati&#x27;s military power, initially suppressed by infighting with his brothers Fokoti, Somcuba and Malambule who supported the kingship of Sidubela, to whom they had already given custody of royal cattle, was increased in the late 1850s and thereafter. When Mswati&#x27;s armies attacked organized forces of other Bantu tribes or nations, the goal was initially plunder in the form of cattle and captives, rather than incorporation into one political unit. During this period the arrival of Trekboers, in what would become the Transvaal republic, marked the first contact between Swazis and European settlers. Mswati greatly extended the boundaries of the Swazi territory beyond that of the present state with military outposts and royal villages outposts such as Embhuleni, on the upper Komati River at the foot of the Mkhingoma Mountains in Badplaas, Mekemeke near the Mbayiyane Mountains, situated east of Mantibovu (Low&#x27;s Creek) and Malelane in Nkomazi. The death of Mswati II in August 1868 ended the era of Swazi conquest, territorial expansion and resulted in unification of various people into one nation.

==Early life==
Ingwenyama Mswati II was born as a son of Somhlolo or Sobhuza I and Queen Tsandzile Ndwandwe, the daughter of Zwide Ndwandwe, the leader of the powerful Ndwandwe clan south of the Pongola River. The Swazi clans under the leadership of Sobhuza I were constantly in conflict with the Ndwandwe&#x27;s. As a result, Sobhuza made an offer to marry one of the daughters of Zwide and establish peace with his neighbors. This culminated in a party being sent to the Ndwandwe capital and Tsandzile was chosen as the wife to bear the successor to Sobhuza. Mswati&#x27;s early life after the death of Sobhuza was marked by disputes over the kingship with his brothers. As a result of this Mswati and his mother were installed in their positions before either of them was properly prepared. 
Such circumstances during his early life are sometimes considered to have predisposed him to be fierce and decisive later in his rule. When Mswati ascended to the throne, his predecessor left him a country claimed to be reaching modern day Barberton in the north, Carolina in the west, Pongola River in the south and Lubombo Mountains in the east.

==Kingship==

After succeeding his father in 1850, King Mswati II commenced a career of large-scale raids and adventure. He selected, as his hunting ground, the prosperous tribal lands of the various groups to the north of Eswatini. He became rich and his crack regiments, such as the Nyatsi, Umbhula and the Malalane, brought terror to African homes as far afield as Zimbabwe and Mozambique. His crack regiments were used more importantly against &quot;emakhandzambili&quot; chiefs in Swazi territory and others outside Eswatini. The foothills of the Drakensberg, westwards from Malelane and Low&#x27;s Creek to the Barberton mountain land, were occupied by Mbayi, also known as the Maseko people, who were held in subjection by, but were not incorporated with, the people of AbakaNgcamane Maseko . They were driven out of this area in 1852 by the Swazi regiments. They fled north and occupied the area between the Crocodile and Sabie Rivers. King Mswati 2nd also used his force to influence political events in the Gaza kingdom, east of the Lubombo mountains. He also defended his country against Zulu encroachment with great determination.

Mswati built a line of military outposts from west to east along the &#x27;Little Crocodile River&#x27; (Kaap River). At each outpost he stationed some of his regiments to watch and stop the Bapedi returning to their old haunts. The posts were Mbhuleni, on the upper Komati River, at the foot of the Mkhingoma Mountains, south of Badplaas, where Ngcina Matsebula was the indvuna, and Nandzi LaMagadlela Khumalo the Nkhosikati (chieftainess), and at Mekemeke, just east of the Mbayiyane mountains (Three Sisters), situated east of Mantibovu (Low&#x27;s Creek), where Mekemeke Lanyandza III was the chieftainess and Mhlahlo Vilakati the indvuna. Mekemeke is situated high up on the eastern side of the Mbayiyane mountains, from where the drift in the Crocodile River near Malelane could be observed should the Mbayi return to the area. Mswati moved his administrative capital and military posts to Hhohho, on the northern bank of the Mlumati River and continued his attacks on the various tribes, which include the Bapedi, the Baphalaborwa, the Lobedu near Duiwelskloof, the Venda of Zoutpansberg and as far afield as the Great Zimbabwe and the plains of Mozambique. A. T. Bryant writes that in this way Mswati gradually extended borders, increased his subjects and added to the wealth and strength of his kingdom. It is clear that he had a formidable army and Bryant calls him &quot; &#x27;a veritable Shaka of the north&#x27; &quot;. The indvuna of Hhohho was Matsafeni Mdluli fourth, brother of Labotsibeni, who later became the mother of Ngwane V. Matsafeni moved to the Nelspruit area in 1888 and H. L. Hall named the station Mataffin, 5 km west of Nelspruit, after him. Malambule who was Mswati&#x27;s half-brother, held the reins of government until the young Mswati became king of Eswatini in 1840. Malambule appropriated and hid some of the royal cattle for himself, colluding with his brother Fokoti to commit an act that was tantamount to treason. When Mswati found out about the cattle, he sent his men to punish Malambule. Malambule fled with his brothers Fokoti, Sidubela and Ndlela to the south of the country to seek refuge among the Kunene clan. They later fled to Zululand when Mswati sent his regiments to attack this clan for giving protection to the refugees.

The disruption of rival kingdoms magnified Mswati&#x27;s power and distant tribesmen sought his protection. King Mswati 2nd established loyal groups in sparsely populated chiefdoms under their own leadership, and in others, he placed royal princes and trusted commoners. These new groups and the immigrants became known as &quot;Emafikamuva&quot; ( &quot;those who arrived after&quot; ).

==Later life==

Mswati died at his royal residence at Hhohho in August, 1865, aged about forty. He was buried at the royal burial hill at Mbilaneni, next to his father and great-grandfather. The death of Mswati II ended the era of Swazi conquest, territorial expansion and unification of various peoples into one nation. Mswati&#x27;s successor was the eleven-year-old Ludvonga. He died in 1874 without any children and Mbandzeni became the new King in June 1875. He was known as Dlamini IV (1875-1889). Ludvonga&#x27;s older half brother Mabhedla was regarded as a threat to the crown prince and had to flee from Eswatini. He fled Eswatini in approximately 1872 or 1873 and lived for a while on the farm Stonehaven, some 8 km northwest of Low&#x27;s Creek, before moving on until he settled at the Leolo mountains, near Steelpoort, west of Burgersfort. He died in 1895 and is buried on the Leolo mountains.

<text>Dane Jeffrey Cook (born March 18, 1972) is an American stand-up comedian and film actor. He is known for his use of observational, often vulgar, and sometimes dark comedy. He released six comedy albums: &quot;Harmful If Swallowed&quot; (2003), &quot;Retaliation&quot; (2005), &quot;Vicious Circle&quot; (2006), &quot;Rough Around the Edges: Live from Madison Square Garden&quot; (2007), and &quot;Isolated Incident&quot; (2009).

He is one of the first comedians to use a personal webpage and Myspace to build a large fan base,
and in 2006 was described as &quot;alarmingly popular&quot;. 
Cook starred in numerous films such as &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; (2006), &quot;Good Luck Chuck&quot; (2007), and &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot; (2008). He also acted in &quot;Mystery Men&quot; (1999), &quot;Waiting...&quot; (2005), &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot; (2007), &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot; (2007) and provided the lead voice role in the 2013 animated sports comedy film &quot;Planes&quot;, and its 2014 sequel &quot;&quot; as Dusty Crophopper. 

He was the second comedian (after Andrew Dice Clay) to sell out Madison Square Garden&#x27;s large arena space. In 2006, &quot;Retaliation&quot; became the highest-charting comedy album in 28 years and went platinum. He performed an HBO special in late 2006, &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, a straight-to-DVD special titled &quot;Rough Around The Edges&quot; (which is included in the album of the same name), and a Comedy Central special in 2009 titled &quot;Isolated Incident&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Cook was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the second son of Donna Jean (née Ford; died 2006) and George F. Cook (died 2007). He has an older half-brother, Darryl, and five sisters. He grew up in a Catholic family of Irish descent.

Cook has described himself as having been &quot;pretty quiet, pretty introverted, shy&quot; as a child, although he was a &quot;wild child&quot; at home. He overcame his shyness in his junior year of high school, when he began acting and doing stand-up comedy. After graduating from high school, he studied graphic design in college as a back-up plan, in case he did not achieve success in comedy. He now designs all of his merchandise, including the cover of his album, &quot;Harmful If Swallowed&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
In 1990, Cook began performing stand-up in comedy clubs.

On October 30, 1992, Cook and a group of local emerging improv/sketch comedians were scheduled to appear at the Boston Garden as part of local radio station WBCN&#x27;s &quot;Rock of Boston&quot; music concert. Although they anticipated appearing earlier in the lineup, they were scheduled to perform between popular band Spin Doctors and the final headline act Phish, making them somewhat nervous but determined to do well. Moments after they took the stage however, the crowd, neither expecting nor appreciating a comedy act at this late stage in the evening&#x27;s program and impatient for Phish to go on, expressed their displeasure by throwing their shoes at the stage. Robert Kelly, also on stage as a member of the comedy group, pleaded with the audience to settle down and let them perform their act; the crowd instead escalated to throwing lighters. Sustaining minor injuries, Cook and the comedy group left the stage. Cook described the incident – as well as how dejected he felt and his resulting determination to someday return to the Boston Garden and perform successfully someday – as part of a web series for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; entitled &quot;Worst I Ever Bombed&quot;.

=== Stand-up ===
==== 1990s ====
In 1994, Cook moved to New York City and began performing. Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, where he still lives today. His big break came in 1998 when he appeared on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Premium Blend&quot;. In 2000, Cook did a half-hour special on &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot;. Since then his special has won the Comedy Central Stand-up showdown twice in a row.

==== 2000s ====
In 2003, Cook released his first CD/DVD, &quot;Harmful If Swallowed&quot;. He signed a contract with Comedy Central Records. The album is certified platinum. He released his second CD/DVD in 2005, entitled &quot;Retaliation&quot;. This album went double platinum and made Cook the first comic in 27 years to have an album in the top 5 on the Billboard charts after Steve Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Wild and Crazy Guy&quot; moved as high as #2 in late 1978. He performed at the MTV Video Music Awards, and then afterwards he joined Snoop Dogg in presenting the award for Best New Artist.

On April 15, 2005, Cook performed his first HBO Special entitled &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;. &quot;Vicious Circle&quot; was filmed &quot;in the round&quot; at the TD Garden. The same year, Cook shot two pilot episodes for his own sitcom, &quot;Cooked&quot;. The sitcom was not picked up and the two pilot episodes were later released on DVD as the &quot;Lost Pilot&quot;. That same year, he embarked on a 30-day, 20-show college tour called Tourgasm with his longtime friends Robert Kelly, Gary Gulman, and Jay Davis. The tour was filmed and was later made into a 9-episode documentary on HBO.

On December 3, 2005, Cook hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;). He would then go on to host the premiere of season 32 of &quot;SNL&quot; a year later. The same year Cook launched his own company, &quot;Superfinger Entertainment&quot;, in order to produce his own albums and videos.

In 2006, Cook headlined for Dave Attell&#x27;s Insomniac Tour and hosted the 2006 Teen Choice Awards alongside Jessica Simpson. The following year he won the award for Best Comedian. On November 12, 2007, Cook became the second comic to sell out Madison Square Garden&#x27;s large arena space after Andrew Dice Clay accomplished this feat in 1990. He did two sold-out shows in one night. The show was filmed and would later be put onto a DVD to be sold on Cook&#x27;s third comedy album. Cook won the Big Entertainer Award at the VH1 Big in &#x27;06 Awards, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot Comic of the Year. The following day, November 13, 2007, he released his third CD/DVD entitled &quot;Rough Around The Edges&quot;, which was filmed live at Madison Square Garden in New York City. During that time, he embarked on his first arena tour.

On April 10, 2007, Cook broke the Laugh Factory&#x27;s endurance record (previously held by Richard Pryor) by performing on stage for three hours and 50 minutes. Dave Chappelle would break the record five days later by performing for six hours and seven minutes. Chappelle beat that record on December 3, 2007, by performing for six hours and twelve minutes. On January 1, 2008, Cook broke Chappelle&#x27;s record, by performing on stage for seven hours.

From May 23, 2008, to May 25, 2008, Cook reunited with Robert Kelly and Al Del Bene for three shows at The Coliseum in Caesars Palace. From May 29-June 4, 2008, the trio went to Iraq to perform for the troops. Del Bene was the Emcee, Kelly was the feature, and Cook was the headliner.

He finished his fourth album, &quot;Isolated Incident&quot;; a performance which aired on Comedy Central on May 17, 2009, with the release of the record following two days later. He kicked off that tour at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut, on April 25, 2009. This album was the last as part of Cook&#x27;s four-record deal with Comedy Central Records. The new album was performed at Laugh Factory in Hollywood, which is considered to be Cook&#x27;s home base, where he goes to work on new material. He released the DVD version of &quot;Isolated Incident&quot; in November 2009.

==== 2010s ====
In 2012, Cook caused a minor controversy when a joke he made in a comedy club about the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting was recorded and made the headlines.He later apologized on Twitter: &quot;I am devastated by the recent tragedy in Colorado &amp; did not mean to make light of what happened. I made a bad judgment call with my material last night &amp; regret making a joke at such a sensitive time. My heart goes out to all of the families &amp; friends of the victims.&quot;

In 2014, Showtime aired Cook&#x27;s &quot;Troublemaker&quot; special.

In September 2016 Cook headlined with Sebastian Maniscalco at the Oddball Comedy Festival in Dallas, Texas, and the Oddball Comedy &amp; Curiosity Festival in Irvine, California. He also toured Canada in November at the annual &quot;Just For Laughs&quot; comedy festival.

In May 2018 he performed at Hard Rock Rocksino in Northfield Park, Ohio.

At the end of 2018 Cook announced the &quot;Tell It Like It is&quot; Tour, his first full-scale stand-up tour since &quot;Under Oath&quot; in 2013. The tour began in February 2019 in Huntington, New York and concluded in November in Los Angeles, California.

=== Film ===

=== Stage ===

On November 18, 2010, it was announced that both Cook and Josh Hamilton would be starring in Neil LaBute&#x27;s 2011 Broadway production of &quot;Fat Pig&quot;; however, before the show began it was postponed for financial reasons.

In 2012, he played Franz Liebkind in the Hollywood Bowl production of &quot;The Producers&quot;.

=== Television ===
His first TV role was playing a quarterback named Kyle on the 1995 ABC comedy &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;, which starred Marie Osmond, Betty White and Ashley Johnson.

In October 2005, during an interview with Jay Leno on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, actress Charlize Theron leaned forward and allowed Cook to kiss her backside.

In May 2012, it was announced that Cook would be starring in the new NBC comedy &quot;Next Caller&quot;. On October 12, 2012, the show was canceled prior to its airing after filming four out of six episodes.

== Comedic style ==
Cook&#x27;s style is principally &quot;long-form storytelling&quot; and &quot;multipurpose phrases&quot;. Cook says his onstage persona is a combination of the personalities of his mom, Donna, and his dad, George. &quot;My mother is like a Looney Tunes cartoon. She&#x27;s wiggly ... She has the ability to tongue in cheek a lot, and do it in a way where she&#x27;s being physical. My dad is the polar opposite. He always had a little &#x27;what the fuck&#x27; in his voice. Even if he knew nothing about what he was talking about, he could sell it. So I looked at these two extremely funny people and created a style of comedy from absorbing their actions.&quot;

He explains: 

=== Reception ===
One reviewer noted that Cook attracted a young, growing audience through colorful observations and high-energy performances.

Commentators in a variety of media sources have characterized Dane Cook&#x27;s humor as unfunny. Comedian Ron White has criticized Dane Cook for his lack of real material and for his inflated ego, saying: &quot;[He] does not make me laugh, at all, in any way, shape or form.&quot; When asked about his opinion of Cook on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, comedian Nick DiPaolo said &quot;he doesn&#x27;t make me laugh, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s not funny.&quot; On Boston radio station WBCN, Dane Cook was named by radio show Toucher and Rich to a tournament of the top 16 &quot;Worst Comedians&quot; and, based on listener voting, was voted the &quot;Worst Comedian&quot; of all. In the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot;, Elie Zwiebel and co-author Jesse Bean wrote that &quot;he&#x27;s managed to become one of the most overrated comics ever&quot; and that his act is &quot;boringly stagnant&quot;. In an interview with Jason Tanamor of Zoiks! Online, Tanamor asked Cook why he was so despised. Cook stated that he&#x27;d had conversations with his therapist, attributing some of the negativity to his alpha demeanor. Add to that, Cook&#x27;s highly successful career. &quot;Unfortunately, what you find is, you know in your graduating class with the guys you came up with, there&#x27;s going to be some dudes in front of you that don&#x27;t want you catching up, and there&#x27;s going to be some guys behind you that maybe they&#x27;ve never had an opportunity. That, coupled with, like you said, reaching the Billboard charts with &#x27;Retaliation&#x27; and a lot of people going, &#x27;Who the fuck does he think he is?&#x27;

Jim Breuer talked about Cook&#x27;s reputation within the comedy industry, saying: &quot;Everyone kills this guy ... Not one comedian comes on [my Sirius radio show] and says &#x27;I&#x27;m so happy for him&#x27;, which is weird. ... They can&#x27;t stand this poor guy.&quot; Breuer went on to say that he personally thinks Cook is a &quot;tremendous performer&quot;.

Paul Provenza said that he was not a fan of his earlier work, but &quot;...caught a couple of Dane Cook shows at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, and he was fantastic&quot;, and became a fan because he felt he had &quot;matured&quot;.

=== Accusations of plagiarism ===
Comedian Joe Rogan claimed that Cook performed a bit on an episode of &quot;Premium Blend&quot; that Rogan had developed on &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Dead Someday&quot;, and claimed to have performed the routine earlier in clubs with Cook present. In 2010, Rogan had Cook as a guest on his podcast, telling him that he was a &quot;good dude&quot; and that he was &quot;...glad we put all that shit past and hung out...I think you are doing some awesome shit.&quot; Cook replied: &quot;That means the world hearing that from you, Joe ... You&#x27;ve got a lot of integrity and I&#x27;ve always had a lot of respect for you.&quot;

There was also widespread Internet discussion regarding three bits from Cook&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Retaliation&quot;, and similar bits from comic Louis C.K.&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Live in Houston&quot;. In 2011, Cook played himself in an episode of &quot;Louie&quot;, scripted by C.K., centering on a fictional encounter between the two comics during which they discuss the controversy. In an interview in 2012, Louis C.K. defended Cook, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t think he stole from me knowingly... I think he sort of got some of my jokes in his head and got sloppy. He&#x27;s a good guy and not capable of maleficence.&quot;

Cook&#x27;s half-brother, Darryl McCauley, served as his business manager until 2008, when Cook discovered that McCauley and his wife Erika had embezzled at least $12 million from him. They were charged with embezzlement and larceny in 2010, and pleaded guilty. Darryl was sentenced to six years in prison and 16 years of probation, and Erika was sentenced to three years in prison and 13 years of probation. Both were ordered to pay restitution to Cook.

Cook says he has never had a drink of alcohol or done drugs.

In 2017, Cook began dating fitness instructor Kelsi Taylor, who is 26 years his junior. They became engaged on July 13, 2022. The couple married on September 23, 2023, in an intimate ceremony at a private estate in O&#x27;ahu, Hawaii.

The municipal unit Ermioni also contains the communities Iliokastro (7 km north of Ermioni) and Thermisia (7 km east of Ermioni). It is 10 km east of Kranidi,17,27 km southwest of Porto Cheli 22 km southwest of Galatas and 44 km southeast of Nafplio. Ermioni is connected to Piraeus by ferry.

==History==

The place has been continuously inhabited, at least since the times of Homer. Long before classical times ancient Hermione was settled by Dryopians. During the classic era it was well known for its shipbuilders and also for the production of porphyra, a very important red dye. This dye was used for the colouring of the uniforms of many armies including that of Alexander the Great. It controlled a wider region named Hermionis.

Pausanias described the major temples and buildings, various festivities and sport games of the town. According to Pausanias, Ermioni was also the home of a temple of the goddess Hestia: 
:&quot;[At Hermione in Argolis :] Passing into the sanctuary of Hestia, we see no image, but only an altar, and they sacrifice to Hestia upon it.&quot; This was exceptional, as Hestia normally did not have temples but was worshipped in the prytaneum of each city, and a sanctuary of the goddess was therefore something highly unusual—Pausanias himself mentions only two (the other one in Sparta).

During the Ottoman Era it was still known for ship building and its naval abilities, which played a significant role in the Greek revolution of 1821.
