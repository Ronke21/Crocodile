<text>Lester Keith Piggott (5 November 1935 – 29 May 2022) was an English professional jockey and horse trainer. With 4,493 career flat racing wins in Britain, including a record nine Epsom Derby victories, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest flat racing jockeys of all time and the originator of a much-imitated style. Popularly called &quot;The Long Fellow&quot;, he was known for his competitive personality, restricting his weight and, on occasion, not sparing the whip, such as in the 1972 Derby. Piggott was convicted of tax fraud in 1987 and sentenced to three years in prison, but served just over a year.

==Early life==
Piggott was born in Wantage, Berkshire, to a family that could trace its roots as jockeys and trainers back to the 18th century. The Piggotts were a Cheshire farming family who from the 1870s ran the Crown Inn in Nantwich for over 30 years. Piggott&#x27;s grandfather, Ernest Piggott (1878–1967), rode three Grand National winners, in 1912, 1918 and 1919, and was married to a sister of the jockeys Mornington Cannon and Kempton Cannon, who both rode winners of the Derby, in 1899 and 1904, respectively. He was also three-times British jump racing Champion Jockey (in 1910, 1913 and 1915), and owned a racehorse stable at the Old Manor in Letcombe Regis (now in Oxfordshire). 

Lester Piggott&#x27;s father, (Ernest) Keith Piggott (1904–1993), was a successful National Hunt jockey and trainer, winning the Champion Hurdle as a jockey in 1939 and the Grand National as a trainer in 1963 with Ayala, becoming the British jump racing Champion Trainer of the 1962–63 season. He owned a training stable at South Bank in Lambourn, where Lester Piggott lived until 1954. Lester Piggott was a cousin, through his mother Lilian Iris Rickaby, jockeys Bill and Fred Rickaby. Fred was British flat racing Champion Apprentice in 1931 and 1932.

==Career==
Piggott began racing horses from his father&#x27;s stable when he was ten years old and won his first race in 1948, aged twelve, on a horse called The Chase, at Haydock Park. Piggott was known for his quiet demeanour. He described his mother as wisely playing down his success, while his father rarely gave advice unless there had been a particular mistake. By his teens a sensation in the racing world, he rode his first winner of The Derby on Never Say Die in 1954, aged eighteen, and went on to win eight more, on Crepello (1957), St. Paddy (1960), Sir Ivor (1968), Nijinsky (1970), Roberto (1972), Empery (1976), The Minstrel (1977) and Teenoso (1983). He was stable jockey to Noel Murless and later to Vincent O&#x27;Brien and had a glittering career of unparalleled success. Known as the &quot;housewives&#x27; favourite&quot;, Piggott had legions of followers and did much to expand the popularity of horse racing beyond its narrow, class-based origins.

Famously tall for a flat jockey (), hence his nickname of &quot;The Long Fellow&quot;, Piggott struggled to keep his weight down and for most of his career rode at . He pioneered a new style of race-riding that was subsequently widely adopted by colleagues at home and abroad and enabled him to become Champion Jockey eleven times. He also rode over hurdles early in his career.
In 1980, his relationship with the Sangster–O&#x27;Brien combination came to an end and he was appointed stable jockey to Noel Murless&#x27;s son-in-law Henry Cecil, the British flat racing Champion Trainer, at Murless&#x27;s old stables, Warren Place. He was again champion jockey in 1981 and 1982.

In late 1983, a dispute arose as to whether Piggott had reneged on an agreement to ride Daniel Wildenstein&#x27;s All Along in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe for Patrick Louis Biancone when Piggott stated he had agreed to ride the previous year&#x27;s Arc third Awaasif and could only ride All Along if that horse did not run. All Along was ridden instead by Walter Swinburn, with Wildenstein refusing to allow Piggott to ride any more of his horses. It was costly for Piggott, as All Along won the Arc and a string of other international races in an autumn campaign that ended with her being named U.S. Horse of the Year. As Wildenstein was one of Cecil&#x27;s principal owners, this placed a strain on the relationship and, in 1984, Cecil and Piggott split, with Steve Cauthen taking over at Warren Place.

In 1985, Piggott rode freelance, with big wins including the Prix de Diane for André Fabre aboard Lypharita, the 2000 Guineas Stakes for Michael Stoute on Shadeed and the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and Irish Champion Stakes for Luca Cumani on Commanche Run.

With 4,493 career wins on the Flat in Britain and approximately 5,300 worldwide, including a record nine Epsom Derby victories, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest flat racing jockeys of all time. Piggott&#x27;s 30 Classic wins in Britain came from 25 individual horses.

Of his great winners, Piggott regarded Sir Ivor as the easiest to ride.

==Later life==
Piggott retired as a jockey at the end of the 1985 flat season and became a trainer. His Eve Lodge stables in Newmarket in Suffolk, housed 97 horses and sent out 34 winners. His burgeoning new career as a trainer was ended when he was convicted of tax fraud and jailed. He was stripped of his appointment as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), which had been awarded in 1975. He served 366 days in prison. According to Piggott, a commonly held belief that he was prosecuted after using an undeclared bank account, to make a final settlement of his tax liabilities, is a myth.

Piggott resumed his career as a jockey in 1990, at the age of 55, and won the Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile on Royal Academy within ten days of his return. He rode another Classic winner, Rodrigo de Triano, in the 1992 2000 Guineas. His last win in Britain was in October 1994 and he officially retired in 1995; his last British ride was in the November Handicap on 5 November 1994, but he rode abroad through the winter of 1994–95, winning the Black Opal Stakes on Zadok in Canberra on 5 March 1995 before deciding not to return for the 1995 British Flat turf season.

Piggott lived near Newmarket for the entire duration of his career. He later emigrated to Bursinel, Switzerland, where he continued to reside with his partner and family friend Lady Barbara FitzGerald, then the 55-year-old wife of Lord John FitzGerald, though legally he was still married to his wife Susan. In 2004, he published the book &quot;Lester&#x27;s Derbys&quot;.

On 15 May 2007, Piggott was admitted to intensive care in a hospital in Geneva, following a recurrence of a previous heart problem. His wife stated that this illness was not life-threatening and that he was recovering in intensive care as a precaution. He attended Royal Ascot in June 2007 and the Epsom Derby in June 2008 where he tipped the winner, New Approach, during a BBC television interview. He was also present for the 2009 Cheltenham Gold Cup where he presented a trophy to jockey Tony McCoy.

In 2014 the Eve Lodge Stables training yard and complex, which included four semi-detached, two-bedroom bungalows and which could house up to 100 horses, was put on the market for £1.25 million.

==Personal life==
Piggott was married to Susan Armstrong. They married at St. Mark&#x27;s church, North Audley Street, London, in 1960. Her father, Sam Armstrong, and her brother, Robert Armstrong, were both racehorse trainers. They had two daughters, Maureen, an ex-eventer (married to Derby-winning trainer William Haggas) and Tracy (a sports presenter on Irish television station RTÉ). He also had a son, Jamie, also a jockey, from a relationship with Anna Ludlow.

Piggott was partially deaf and had a minor speech impediment. He was also known for his dry wit, despite a reputation for being taciturn. For example, when asked by a reporter, after Karabas had won the 1969 Washington International, when he thought he would win, Piggott replied &quot;about two weeks ago&quot;. Allegedly when asked by a stable employee for a £1 gratuity, Piggott motioned to the employee to speak into his &quot;good ear&quot;, at which point the employee increased the request to £2. Piggott responded with &quot;try the other ear again&quot;. On being asked by a young girl serving him with ice cream if he was soul singer Wilson Pickett, he said &quot;yes&quot;.

==Death==
Piggott died in hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, on 29 May 2022, at the age of 86.

==Recognition==
The annual jockey awards The Lesters, inaugurated in 1990, are named in his honour. In 1999, the &quot;Racing Post&quot; ranked Piggott as second in their list of the Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century, behind Gordon Richards. In 2021, Piggott was, along with Frankel, one of the first two entries in the British Champions Series Hall of Fame.

==In popular culture==
The British music band James recorded a song named &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; on their 1993 album &quot;Laid&quot;. The outro on the original 12&quot; of &quot;Sit Down&quot; (1989) also featured a falsetto voice singing the jockey&#x27;s name. The 1990 Van Morrison song &quot;In the Days Before Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; also mentions Piggott by name: &quot;When we let, then we bet / On Lester Piggott when we met [ten to one] / And we let the goldfish go&quot;.

Piggott was frequently caricatured on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, in which he was portrayed as having mumbling diction, voiced by Enn Reitel. 

In 1991, during a period in which Queen Elizabeth II faced public pressure to pay taxes, the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; showed a cover picture of her talking on a telephone, asking for Lester Piggott.

<text>The Irish Republican Socialist Party or IRSP () is a minor communist, Marxist–Leninist and Irish republican party in Ireland. It is often referred to as the &quot;political wing&quot; of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) paramilitary group. The party&#x27;s youth wing is the Republican Socialist Youth Movement (RSYM). It was founded by former members of &#x27;Official&#x27; Sinn Féin in 1974 during the Troubles, but claims the legacy of the Irish Socialist Republican Party of 1896–1904. The party opposes the Good Friday Agreement and the European Union.

==History==
===1970s===

The Irish Republican Socialist Party was founded at a meeting on 8 December 1974 in the Spa Hotel in Lucan, near Dublin, by former members of Workers&#x27; Party (aka &#x27;Official&#x27; Sinn Féin), headed by Seamus Costello. He had been expelled from the Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) following a court-martial, and from Official Sinn Féin on the same basis. Along with other activists, he was dissatisfied with the group&#x27;s tactics and policies, especially on the issues surrounding the 1972 OIRA ceasefire and his growing belief that the emerging conflict was sectarian. According to the IRSP, 80 people were in attendance. A paramilitary wing, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), was founded the same day, although its existence was intended to be kept hidden until such a time that the INLA could operate effectively. Costello was elected as the party&#x27;s first chairperson and the Army&#x27;s first chief of staff. Together, the IRSP and the INLA were referred to as the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM).

Former Unity MP for Mid-Ulster Bernadette McAliskey served on the executive of the IRSP. In December 1975 she resigned following the failure of a motion to be passed which would have brought the INLA under the control of the IRSP (executive committee). This led to the resignation of half the , which weakened the party. Tony Gregory, a future Dublin TD, was also a member for a short time.

In one of the first of the INLA&#x27;s armed operations, Billy McMillen, commanding officer of the OIRA Belfast Battalion, was murdered by INLA member Gerard Steenson.

On 5 October 1977, Costello was shot dead in his car by a man armed with a shotgun. His supporters blamed the Official IRA for the killing.

The party&#x27;s poor showing in the 1977 Irish general election, resignations, and the assassination of Costello, weakened the organisation.

===1980s===
In 1980, several IRSP and INLA members—including John Turnley, Miriam Daly, Ronnie Bunting and Noel Little—were killed by Ulster loyalist paramilitaries, most prominently the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). The IRSP have contended that the killings were a result of collusion between loyalists and security forces, even suspecting that some of the killings were carried out by the SAS with responsibility attributed to the UDA.

Three members of the INLA and IRSP died in the 1981 Irish hunger strike in HM Prison Maze, also known as Long Kesh: Patsy O&#x27;Hara, Kevin Lynch, and Michael Devine.

In 1987, the IRSP and INLA came under attack from the Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation (IPLO), an organisation founded by Gerard Steenson, Jimmy Brown and Martin &#x27;Rook&#x27; O&#x27;Prey, consisting of people who had resigned or been expelled from the INLA. A political wing, the Republican Socialist Collective (RSC), was also formed by Brown. The IPLO&#x27;s initial aim was to destroy the IRSM and replace it with their organisation. Five members of the INLA and IRSP were killed by the IPLO, including leaders Ta Power and John O&#x27;Reilly. The INLA retaliated with several killings of their own. After the INLA killed the IPLO&#x27;s leader, Steenson, a truce was reached. Although severely damaged by the IPLO&#x27;s attacks, the INLA continued to exist. The IPLO, which was heavily involved in drug dealing, was forcibly disbanded by the Provisional IRA in a large scale operation in 1992.

===Recent history===
In the 2000s and 2010s, the IRSP has been involved in campaigns and political protests, mainly around Belfast and Derry but also in of parts of the Republic of Ireland as well. Some of these protests included anti-austerity protests, the Right2Water campaign against water charges, opposition to welfare reform and introduction of universal credit, and supporting striking nurses.

In November 2016, after a number of raids on members of the party&#x27;s homes, the IRSP issued a warning saying the PSNI were &quot;playing with fire&quot;. IRSP&#x27;s Lower Falls representative Michael Kelly claimed that &quot;British security forces risk bringing serious conflict onto the streets&quot; and said that &quot;The Irish Republican Socialist Party has been in existence for over 40 years, in that time we have never tolerated attacks on our membership from any quarter,&quot; The comments drew criticism from UUP MLA Doug Beattie and SDLP Alex Attwood.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the IRSP launched Republican Socialist Aid, which aimed to distribute PPE to healthcare and essential workers in communities across Ireland at risk of exposure to the virus.

In September 2020 the IRSP started a &#x27;Drop The Rents&#x27; campaign, requesting landlords and letting agencies in North Belfast and West Belfast to lower their rent prices to local housing benefit levels and protesting against landlords and letting agencies that would not and that issued threats of eviction. The campaign has achieved some level of success.

During the East Wall protests in November 2022, the IRSP opposed the housing of 380 refugees due to the absence of notice given to residents about the move prior to arrival and the feasibility of using the housing there for a large number of refugees. They said the residents were not opposed to refugees, just the lack of notice and uncertainty of feasibility. This differed to the majority of other groups who opposed any housing of refugees, regardless of notice.

==Elections==
In May 1981, party members Gerry Kelly and Sean Flynn won two seats on the Belfast City Council in a joint campaign with the People&#x27;s Democracy party. Neither councillor served a full term, with one going on the run after being implicated during the supergrass trials.

In June 1981, the IRSP ran two candidates, Kevin Lynch and Tony O&#x27;Hara (brother of Patsy O&#x27;Hara), in the Irish parliamentary election as Independent Anti H-Block candidates. Neither candidate won, but Lynch received 3,337 votes (7.63%) and came within 300 votes of winning a seat in Waterford, while O&#x27;Hara received 3,034 votes (6.49%) in Dublin West. In 1982, party member Brigid Makowski won a seat on the Shannon Town Commission.

The IRSP put forward five candidates in the 2011 Northern Ireland local elections, its first foray into electoral politics in almost 30 years. They failed to secure any seats. Candidate Paul Gallagher of Strabane missed out on a seat by just a single vote. He was originally elected but after a requested recount by the SDLP his election was overturned.

The IRSP has explained its lack of participation in elections as due to &quot;very limited&quot; resources.

In 2022 for the first time the IRSP fielded candidates for the Northern Ireland Assembly election. Initially their candidates were rejected by the Electoral Commission, but this was eventually corrected. Candidates were fielded in Belfast West (1,103 first preference votes, 2.5%) and Foyle (766 first preference votes, 1.6%).


==Policies and ideology==
The IRSP are Marxist–Leninist and Irish republican, seeking the establishment of an all-Ireland &quot;worker&#x27;s republic&quot;. As of 2009, the IRSP stated that their objective will only be achieved exclusively through peaceful and political means, and in 2018 they launched the &#x27;Yes For Unity&#x27; campaign, to campaign for a Border Poll on Irish Unity.

The IRSP claim the legacy of Connolly and say their policies are of the same tradition of Connolly. The IRSP also see their own modern policies as the &quot;logical development in the twenty-first century of the programme established under Connolly’s leadership by the Irish Socialist Republican Party&quot;.

===Physical force Irish republicanism===

The IRSP opposes both the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Peace Process, The party supports a &#x27;No First Strike&#x27; policy, allowing people to see the perceived failure of the peace process for themselves without taking military actions.

As of 11 October 2009, the INLA has ordered an end to the armed struggle, because unlike during the Troubles, the current political stance in Ulster allows the IRSP to contest fairly in new campaigns and local elections, as mentioned in their 2009 statement. INLA admitted to &quot;faults and grievous errors&quot; in their prosecution of the armed struggle, stating that &quot;innocent people were killed and injured&quot; and offering &quot;as revolutionaries&quot; a &quot;sincere and heartfelt apology&quot;.

===European Union===
The IRSP supports greater strengthening of Ireland&#x27;s independence, and although understanding the benefits brought through European Union (EU) membership, it also notes the incompatibility of EU membership with the need for a socialist society. Consequently, the IRSP supports moves towards greater co-operation between European socialist political organisations.

The IRSP supported Brexit and supports the Republic of Ireland leaving the European Union.

===NATO and Russia===
During the Russo-Ukrainian War, the IRSP publicly declared their support for the Russian-backed separatists of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic. It blamed NATO rather than Russia for the conflict. On 25 February 2022, one day after Russia invaded Ukraine, the party re-affirmed its support for the Republics in a social media post in which they called Ukraine a &quot;Nazi regime&quot; and a &quot;NATO puppet&quot;. It included a picture of IRSP members posing in front of Free Derry Corner with the flags of the Soviet Union and the Donetsk Republic. This was condemned by local SDLP councillors. The party boasted about the INLA&#x27;s bombing of a radar station on Mount Gabriel, County Cork in 1982, which it said was used by NATO. In August 2022, IRSP members and Russian nationalists staged a protest against the Ukrainian military, outside Dublin&#x27;s General Post Office. The Irish security services believe the Russian government were involved in organizing the protest. IRSP members have publicly supported Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, and the INLA have been accused of receiving &quot;dark money&quot; from the Russian state.

===Broad Front===
The IRSP supports the formation of what it calls the &quot;Broad Front&quot; which would bring together all Irish &quot;anti-imperialist forces&quot; to bring about a United Ireland. This would be formed on the basis of the following demands:

* The United Kingdom must formally renounce all claims of sovereignty in Ireland
* All British forces in Northern Ireland must be withdrawn, all republican and socialist prisoners must be released, a general amnesty must be granted to republicans for offences committed by them during the Troubles and &quot;repressive legislation&quot; must be replaced by a bill of rights
* The United Kingdom &quot;must also agree to compensate the Irish People for the exploitation which has already occurred&quot;

===Policing===
The IRSP is in favour of an All-Ireland, democratically controlled, unarmed police force.

The IRSP views the reforming of the RUC into the PSNI as a cosmetic exercise and strongly opposes &#x27;political policing&#x27; by the PSNI. They demand an immediate cessation of the activities of MI5 in the North and calls for their expulsion from Ireland.

The IRSP does not believe that there is an ‘independent’ judiciary, or an objective judicial system, and that the judiciary both North and South presides over the laws which were enacted by partitionist governments and representing the interests of the ruling class.

===Abstentionism===
The IRSP are not abstentionist in principle, but they would support abstentionism in certain situations for tactical reasons.

The IRSP will also consider contesting any particular election on the basis of a thorough analysis of the conditions prevailing at the time. 

===Housing===
IRSP believes that the right to a home is a fundamental human right and that the state has a responsibility to deal with homelessness.

===Abortion===
The party&#x27;s policy on abortion is that it should be legalised, available on demand and free of charge.

==Publications==
&quot;The Starry Plough&quot; () is the official newsletter (initially a newspaper, then a magazine) of the party. In 2006 it proclaimed on its website that &quot;The Starry Plough is the only paper that stands firmly against British rule and for the destruction of capitalism in Ireland.&quot;

The name of the paper is taken from the flag of the same name. The decision to use the name &quot;the Starry Plough&quot; was inspired by a newspaper produced by Official Sinn Féin in Derry City in the early 1970s. Produced by the local branch of Official Sinn Féin in Derry, it was edited by Jackie Ward (who went on to edit &quot;The United Irishman&quot;) and Joe Sweeney (who sided with the IRSP following the split with the Officials). The suggestion for the IRSP newspaper was made by Derry members to the IRSP Ard Comhairle in early 1975. The Irish translation An Camchéachta was provided by Mairin Bean Ui Chionnaith, an Irish-language scholar and republican.

The first edition of the new (IRSP) &quot;The Starry Plough&quot; was published in April 1975 under the editorship of Mick Ahern. It included details of the first IRSP public meeting (Dublin, 12 February), an editorial on the IRSP, an interview with Seamus Costello, Easter Rising commemoration notices and a statement from the National Executive of the IRSP.

Subsequent editors included Osgur Breatnach, James Daly, Mary Reid, Seamus Ruddy and (again) Mick Ahern. Important contributors have included Bernadette McAliskey, Tom Hayes, Ite Ni Chionnaith, Eamonn McCann, Niall Leonach, Redmond O&#x27;Hanlon, Gerry Lawless, Siobhan Molloy, and London SWP cartoonist Phil Evans.

==Membership==
Party members are often referred to as the &quot;Irps&quot; (pronounced &quot;Erps&quot;). In the late 1970s, Divis Flats in west Belfast became colloquially known as &quot;the planet of the Irps&quot; (a reference to the IRSP and the film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;).

==International representation==
The party is represented in North America by the Irish Republican Socialist Committees of North America.

<text>Steve Cauthen (born May 1, 1960) is a retired American jockey.

In 1977 he became the first jockey to win over $6 million in a year working with agent Lenny Goodman, and in 1978 he became the youngest jockey to win the U. S. Triple Crown. Cauthen is the only jockey ever named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsman of the Year.

After riding for a few years in the United States, he began racing in Europe. He is the only jockey to have won both the Kentucky Derby and the Epsom Derby.

==Background==
Cauthen, the son of a trainer and a farrier, grew up in Walton, Kentucky, around horses, which (along with his small size) made race-riding a logical career choice.

==Racing career==
===North America===
He rode his first race on May 12, 1976, at Churchill Downs at age 16; he finished last, riding King of Swat. He rode his first winner (Red Pipe) less than a week later, at River Downs. He was the nation&#x27;s leader in race wins in 1977 with 487. In only his second year of riding, he became the first jockey to win $6 million in a single season, passing that mark in December 1977.

In 1978 he became the youngest jockey to ever win the U. S. Triple Crown, riding Affirmed, and he was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsman of the Year.

He had increasing problems making weight and moved to the UK, where jockey weights were higher.

===Europe===
A June 16, 1985, feature story in the &quot;New York Times&quot; titled &quot;Cauthen&#x27;s Success Amazes Britain&quot; said &quot;Cauthen was lured to Britain by Robert Sangster.&quot; Quoting &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Richard Baerlein, a respected racing correspondent for more than 50 years in England, as saying that &quot;He&#x27;s matured into the perfect jockey.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; story also reported that &quot;Henry Cecil signed Cauthen to replace Piggott as the main jockey for his powerful stable.&quot;

In his first race in the UK in April 1979 Cauthen rode Marquee Universal to victory at Salisbury.

Steve Cauthen was British Champion Jockey three times, and won English classic races ten times, including the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby twice, and the St Leger three times. In 1985 he won three Classics riding Oh So Sharp. In 1989 he rode European Horse of the Year Old Vic to victory in the French Derby and the Irish Derby. In 1991 he won the Italian Derby on Hailsham.

==Retirement==
After he finished his riding career, Cauthen returned to Kentucky and bought a stud farm. He participated in Prince Edward of the United Kingdom&#x27;s 1987 charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;.

In 1999, the Racing Post ranked Cauthen as eighth in their list of the Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century.

Cauthen and his wife, Amy settled back in Walton and have three daughters.

<text>Gillette Alexander Elvgren (March 15, 1914 – February 29, 1980)
was an American painter of pin-up models, advertising and illustration. Best known for his pin-up paintings for Brown &amp; Bigelow, Elvgren studied at the American Academy of Art. He was strongly influenced by the early &quot;pretty girl&quot; illustrators, such as Charles Dana Gibson, Andrew Loomis, and Howard Chandler Christy. Other influences included the Brandywine School founded by Howard Pyle.

==Biography==
Elvgren was born in 1914 in St. Paul, Minnesota, where attended University High School. After graduation, he first studied at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts before transferring to the American Academy of Art in Chicago, where he graduated in 1936. Elvgren then joined the stable of artists at Stevens and Gross, Chicago&#x27;s most prestigious advertising agency. He became a protégé of the artist Haddon Sundblom.

In 1937, Gil began painting calendar pin-ups for Louis F. Dow, one of America&#x27;s leading publishing companies, during which time he created about 60 works on 28 × 22 in canvas and distinguished them with a printed signature. Many of his pin-ups were reproduced as nose art on military aircraft during World War II. Circa 1944, Elvgren was approached by Brown and Bigelow, a firm that still dominates the field in producing calendars and advertising specialties. He was associated with Brown &amp; Bigelow from 1945 to 1972. At Brown &amp; Bigelow Elvgren began working with 30 inch x 24 inch canvases, a format that he would use for the next 30 years, and signed his work in cursive.

Elvgren was a commercial success. He lived in various locations, and was active from the 1930s to 1970s. In 1951 he began painting in a studio in his home, then in Winnetka, Illinois, using an assistant to set up lighting, build props and scenes, photograph sets, and prepare his paints. His clients ranged from Brown and Bigelow and Coca-Cola to General Electric and Sealy Mattress Company. During the 1940s and 1950s he illustrated stories for many magazines, such as &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;. Among the models Elvgren painted were Myrna Hansen, Donna Reed, Barbara Hale, Arlene Dahl, Lola Albright and Kim Novak.

==Personal life==
In 1933, Elvgren married Janet Cummins, his high school sweetheart. They lived in Chicago before settling in Siesta Key, Florida in 1940. They had three children together.

Elvgren died of cancer in Florida on February 29, 1980.

<text>The Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery (, sometimes romanized as &quot;Wuchih&quot;) is Taiwan&#x27;s most prominent military cemetery. The cemetery is located on Wuzhi Mountain () at an elevation of in Xizhi, New Taipei City and borders Taipei City&#x27;s Neihu District and Yangmingshan National Park. The cemetery has a wide open view ranging from the Taipei 101 over at Taipei&#x27;s Xinyi District to the Keelung Harbor.

==History==

General Chiang Wei-kuo, the adopted son of Chiang Kai-shek, conceived and designed the cemetery. Prior to the construction of the cemetery, the land was used as a golf course. Planning for the cemetery started in April 1980, with construction starting on March 20, 1981; the cemetery opened on March 29, 1982.

A four-story columbarium named the Memorial Palace () was opened on January 20, 2002 after two years of construction. It has a total capacity of 19,537 niches on the four named floors:

# 

==Issues==

===Capacity===
Although the cemetery has nearly 226 hectares total area, the terrain and building codes restrict interment to only 78 ha of the land. , the cemetery, which has 9,236 grave plots, is nearly full; further deceased military officials will need to be cremated and their ashes stored in the columbarium.

===Chiang family===
In 2004, Chiang Fang-liang made a request to inter the bodies of Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo at Wuzhi. However, the plan did not receive universal support from the Chiang family, and despite the completion of their tombs at Wuzhi, Chiang Kai-shek and his son remain at Cihu and Touliao, respectively.

<doc id="805374" wikidata="Q2857020" url="?curid=805374" title="Diminished seventh chord">
<text>The diminished seventh chord is a four-note chord (a seventh chord) composed of a root note, together with a minor third, a diminished fifth, and a diminished seventh above the root: (1, 3, 5, 7). For example, the diminished seventh chord built on B, commonly written as B7, has pitches B-D-F-A:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&#x27; { 1 } }
&lt;/score&gt;

The chord consists of a diminished triad plus the diminished seventh above the root. These four notes form a stack of three intervals which are all minor thirds. Since stacking yet another minor third returns to the root note, the four inversions of a diminished seventh chord are symmetrical. The integer notation is {0, 3, 6, 9}.

Since the diminished seventh interval is enharmonically equivalent to a major sixth, the chord is enharmonically equivalent to (1, 3, 5, 6).

The diminished seventh chord occurs as a leading-tone seventh chord in the harmonic minor scale. It typically has dominant function and contains two diminished fifths, which often resolve inwards.

The chord notation for the diminished seventh chord (assuming root C) is Cdim7 or C7 (or Cm65 for the enharmonic variant). The notation Cdim or C normally denotes a (three-note) diminished triad, but some jazz charts or other music literature may intend for these to denote the four-note diminished seventh chord instead.

François-Joseph Fétis tuned the chord 10:12:14:17 (17-limit tuning).

==Analysis==
Music theorists have struggled over the centuries to explain the meaning and function of diminished seventh chords. Currently, two approaches are generally used. 

The less complex method treats the leading tone as the root of the chord and the other chord members as the third, fifth, and seventh of the chord, the same way other seventh chords are analyzed.

The other method is to analyze the chord as an &quot;incomplete dominant ninth&quot;, that is a ninth chord with its root on the dominant, whose root is missing or implied. A vii7 chord in the minor key (for example, in C minor, B–D–F–A) occurs naturally in the harmonic minor scale and is equivalent to the dominant 79 chord (G–B–D–F–A) without its root. 

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; {
 &lt;\parenthesize g b d f aes&gt;1 \bar &quot;||&quot;
}
&lt;/score&gt;

This was already proposed by Arnold Schoenberg, and Walter Piston championed this analysis. Jazz guitarist Sal Salvador, and other jazz theorists, also advocated this view, rewriting chord charts to reflect this and supplying the &quot;missing&quot; root as part of their bass lines. The dominant ninth theory was questioned by Heinrich Schenker. He explained that although there is a kinship between all univalent chords rising out of the fifth degree, the dominant ninth chord is not a real chord formation.

Jean-Philippe Rameau explained the diminished seventh chord as a dominant seventh chord whose supposed fundamental bass is borrowed from the sixth degree in minor, raised a semitone producing a stack of minor thirds. Thus, in C, the dominant seventh is G7 (G–B–D–F) and the sixth degree borrowed from the minor scale produces A–B–D–F. 

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; {
 &lt;g b d f&gt;1 &lt;aes b d f&gt; \bar &quot;||&quot;
}
&lt;/score&gt;

In his &quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot;, he observed that three minor thirds and an augmented second make up a chord where the augmented second is such that &quot;the ear is not offended&quot; by it. He may have been talking of the augmented second in quarter-comma meantone, a tuning he favored, which is close to the just septimal minor third of 7:6.
==Function==

=== Most common functions ===

The most common form of the diminished seventh chord is that rooted on the leading tone – for example, in the key of C, the chord (B–D–F–A) – so its other constituents are the , , and (flat submediant) scale degrees. These notes occur naturally in the harmonic minor scale. But this chord also appears in major keys, especially after the time of J.S. Bach, where it is borrowed from the parallel minor.

The chord possesses a dominant function when rooted on the leading tone (otherwise it doesn&#x27;t, but can serve other functions - see below), and this is most straightforwardly shown when the root of a dominant seventh chord is omitted. The remaining third, fifth and seventh of that chord form a diminished triad (whose new root is the third of the former chord), to which a diminished seventh can be added. Thus, in C (major or minor), a dominant seventh chord consisting of G–B–D–F can be replaced by a diminished seventh chord B–D–F–A.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\omit Score.TimeSignature
 \relative c&quot; {
 &lt;g b d f&gt;1 \bar &quot;||&quot;
}
&lt;/score&gt;

In jazz harmony, a combination of the dominant seventh chord with its substitute diminished seventh (with G in the bass and A simultaneously in an upper voice) yields the seven flat-9 chord, which intensifies the dominant function of either a diminished seventh or dominant seventh chord. Other transformations of this kind facilitate a variety of substitutions and modulations: any of the four notes in a diminished seventh chord are &quot;raised&quot; by a semitone, that raised note is then the flat-seventh of a half-diminished seventh chord. Similarly, if any of the four notes in the diminished seventh chord are &quot;lowered&quot; by a semitone, that lowered note is then the root of a dominant seventh chord.

Diminished seventh chords may also be rooted on scale degrees other than the leading-tone, either as secondary function chords temporarily borrowed from other keys, or as appoggiatura chords: a chord rooted on the raised second scale degree (D–F–A–C in the key of C) acts as an appoggiatura to the tonic (C major) chord, and one rooted on the raised sixth scale degree (A–C–E–G in C major) acts as an appoggiatura to the dominant (G major) chord. Such chords however, having no leading tone in relation to the chords to which they resolve, cannot properly have a dominant function. They are therefore referred to commonly as &quot;non-dominant diminished seventh chords&quot; or &quot;common tone diminished seventh chords&quot; (see below).

In jazz, the diminished seventh chord is often based on the scale degree (the flat mediant) and acts as a passing chord between the mediant triad (or first-inversion tonic triad) and the supertonic triad: in C major, this would be the chord progression E minor – E diminished – D minor. The chord, &quot;plays no role in... jazz.&quot; The passing chord is used widely in Brazilian music such as choro, samba and bossa nova.

=== Other functions ===

Another common use of the chord is as a &quot;sharpened subdominant with diminished seventh&quot; chord. This is represented by the Roman notation iv7, but in classical music is more correctly represented as vii7/V, being a very common way for a composer to approach the dominant of any key. In the key of C, this is Fdim7. It is also a common chord in jazz and ragtime music. A common traditional jazz or Dixieland progression is IV–iv7–V7 (in C major: F–F7–G7). Another common usage of iv7 is often found in Gospel music and jazz progressions such as in the song &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;:

:In C: | C C/E | F Fdim7 | C/G A7 | Dm7 G7 |

One variant of the supertonic seventh chord is the &quot;supertonic diminished seventh&quot; with the raised supertonic, which is enharmonically equivalent to the lowered third (in C: D = E). It may be used as a dominant substitute.

A diminished seventh chord may function as a &quot;common-tone diminished seventh chord&quot;. In this role, a diminished seventh chord resolves to a major or dominant seventh chord whose root is one of the notes of the diminished seventh chord (common tone), the most common being the raised supertonic seventh, which resolves to the tonic in major keys (–I, shown below) and the raised submediant, which resolves to dominant triad or seventh in major keys (–V, shown right), with the altered tones resolving upward by half step in both cases.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\omit Score.TimeSignature
\relative c&#x27; { 
 &lt;dis a&#x27; c fis&gt;1_\markup { \concat { &quot;♯ii&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;o7&quot; \hspace #4 &quot;I&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;6&quot; } } &lt;e g c g&#x27;&gt; \bar &quot;||&quot;
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The ct7 chord, whose function, &quot;is simply one of embellishment,&quot; most often spelled when embellishing I or when embellishing V, is distinguished from the vii7/V chord by common tone chords resolving to I or I while vii7/V resolves to V or I. They may be confused, due to enharmonic equivalency, but resolution is a better indicator of function than spelling. In C:

:ct7/I = d7 = D–F–A–C
:vii7/V = f7 = F–A–C–E (= D)

The diminished chord may also resolve through lowering two of the chord tones producing a supertonic seventh chord (ii7) that may lead to a conventional cadence:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/4)
\omit Score.TimeSignature

}
&lt;/score&gt;

==Expressive potential==
During the Baroque era (1600–1750), European composers became aware of the expressive potential of the diminished seventh chord. In operas and other dramatic works, the chord was frequently used to heighten the sense of passion, anger, danger or mystery. One famous example can be found in J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot; (1737), in which he sets verses from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 27, verses 20–21: &quot;But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The governor [Pilate] answered and said unto them, &#x27;Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you?&#x27; They said, &#x27;Barabbas&#x27;.&quot; Bach sets the text so that the angry multitude&#x27;s harsh reply on the word &quot;Barabbam&quot; is a diminished seventh chord:

&lt;/score&gt;

After Bach, diminished sevenths featured regularly in music to evoke the uncanny or a sense of impending danger. A powerful diminished seventh chord heralds the resurrection of the murdered Commendatore in the final scene of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1787). The dead man&#x27;s statue comes to life and takes the Don down to Hell in one of the most chilling episodes in the entire operatic repertoire (Listen):

In the early years of the 19th century, composers used the diminished seventh with increasing frequency. In &quot;Die Stadt&quot;, one of his darkest and most melancholy songs from &quot;Schwanengesang&quot; (1828), Franz Schubert conjures &quot;the pianistic elaboration of a diminished seventh over an octave tremolo&quot; to convey the sinister rippling of the oars as the protagonist is rowed across a lake towards the town where his lost beloved once lived. According to Edward T. Cone, &quot;This famous arpeggiation seems to arise from nowhere to create an atmospheric prelude... and it dies away to nothing in a postlude.&quot; The song ends on the diminished seventh chord; there is no resolution, &quot;the dissonance is terminal&quot;:

The operas of Carl Maria von Weber, particularly &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; and &quot;Euryanthe&quot;, featured many passages using this chord. The Wolf&#x27;s Glen scene in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821) is an example. According to his early biographer, Alexander Wheelock Thayer, Ludwig van Beethoven spoke disparagingly of the &#x27;accumulation of diminished seventh chords&#x27; in &quot;Euryanthe&quot; (1823). 

Beethoven was himself rather fond of the chord and was well aware of its dramatic potential. Perhaps the clearest instance of the diminished seventh&#x27;s power to evoke mystery and terror can be found in the passage linking the two final movements of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonata, Op. 57 (1806). The placid conclusion of the andante movement is interrupted first by a slowly rolled diminished seventh arpeggio played &quot;pianissimo&quot;, followed by the same chord played an octave above in a sharp, stabbing &quot;fortissimo&quot;.

The final movement of Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; reflects the influence of Weber in its copious use of diminished seventh chords to evoke the spooky atmosphere of a Witch&#x27;s Sabbath: &quot;a sinister gathering of spectres, monsters and weird, infernal mocking creatures&quot;:

By the end of the 19th century, composers had used the diminished seventh so much that it became a cliché of musical expression and consequently lost much its power to shock and thrill. By the turn of the 20th century, many musicians were getting weary of it. In his &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; (1911), Arnold Schoenberg wrote:

==Symmetry==

Because a diminished seventh chord is composed of three stacked minor thirds which evenly divide the chromatic scale, it is symmetrical and its four inversions are composed of the same pitch classes. Understanding what inversion a given diminished seventh chord is written in (and thus finding its root) depends on its enharmonic spelling. For example, Gdim7 (G–B–D–F) is enharmonically equivalent to three other inverted diminished chords with roots on the other three pitches in the chord: 

# Bdim7 (A–B–D–F)
# Ddim7 (A–C–D–F)
# Fdim7 (A–C–E–F)

Nineteenth-century composers in particular often make use of this enharmonic to use these chords for modulations. Percy Goetschius calls it the &quot;enharmonic chord.&quot;

Given the symmetry of the chord (and ignoring enharmonic spelling), it follows that there are only three distinct diminished seventh chords (as opposed to twelve), each a conflation of four enharmonic equivalents. Using Piston&#x27;s incomplete-ninth analysis discussed above, a single diminished seventh chord, without enharmonic change, is capable of the following analyses: V, V/ii, V/III (in minor), V/iii (in major), V/iv, V/V, V/VI (in minor), V/vi (in major), V/VII (in minor). Since the chord may be enharmonically written in four different ways without changing the sound, the above can be multiplied by four, yielding a total of forty-eight possible interpretations. More conservatively, each assumed root may be used as a dominant, tonic, or supertonic, giving twelve possibilities.

The octatonic scale (or diminished scale), a symmetric scale, may be conceived of as two interlocking diminished seventh chords, which may be rearranged into the alpha chord.

<doc id="805401" wikidata="Q725507" url="?curid=805401" title="Sterling Holloway">
<text>Sterling Price Holloway Jr. (January 14, 1905 – November 22, 1992) was an American actor who appeared in over 100 films and 40 television shows. He did voice acting for The Walt Disney Company, playing Mr. Stork in &quot;Dumbo&quot;, Adult Flower in &quot;Bambi&quot;, the Cheshire Cat in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Kaa in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Roquefort the Mouse in &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, and the title character in &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, among many others.

==Early life==
Born in Cedartown, Georgia, on January 14, 1905, Holloway was named after his father, Sterling Price Holloway, who, in turn, was named after a prominent Confederate general, Sterling &quot;Pap&quot; Price. His mother was Rebecca DeHaven Boothby. He had a younger brother named Boothby. The family owned a grocery store in Cedartown, where his father served as mayor in 1912. After graduating from Georgia Military Academy in 1920 at the age of fifteen, he left Georgia for New York City, where he attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. While there, he befriended actor Spencer Tracy, whom he considered one of his favorite working colleagues.

==Career==

===Films and shorts===

In his late teens, Holloway toured with the stock company of &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot;, performing in one-nighters across much of the American West before returning to New York where he accepted small walk-on parts from the Theatre Guild and appeared in the Rodgers and Hart revue &quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot; in the mid-1920s. A talented singer, he introduced &quot;Manhattan&quot; in 1925 and the following year sang &quot;Mountain Greenery&quot;.

He moved to Hollywood in 1926 to begin a film career that lasted almost 50 years. His bushy red hair and foggy distinctive voice meant that he almost always appeared in comedies. His first film was &quot;The Battling Kangaroo&quot; (1926), a silent picture. Over the following decades, Holloway would appear with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Lon Chaney Jr., Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, and John Carradine. In 1942, during World War II, Holloway enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 37 and was assigned to the Special Services. He helped develop a show called &quot;Hey Rookie&quot;, which ran for nine months and raised $350,000 for the Army Relief Fund. In 1945, Holloway played the role of a medic assigned to an infantry platoon in the critically acclaimed film &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot;. Between 1946 and 1947, he played the comic sidekick in five Gene Autry Westerns.

===With Walt Disney===
Walt Disney originally considered Holloway for the voice of Sleepy in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), but chose Pinto Colvig instead. Holloway&#x27;s voice work in animated films began with &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), as the voice of Mr. Stork. Holloway was the voice of the adult Flower in &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), the narrator of the Antarctic penguin sequence in &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944) and the narrator in the &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; sequence of &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; (1946). He was the voice of the Cheshire Cat in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951); the narrator in &quot;The Little House&quot; (1952), &quot;Susie the Little Blue Coupe&quot; (1952), &quot;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&quot; (1952), and &quot;Goliath II&quot; (1960); Amos Mouse from &quot;Ben and Me&quot; (1953)&quot;;&quot; Kaa the snake in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967); and Roquefort the mouse in &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970). He is perhaps best remembered as the voice of Winnie the Pooh in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; featurettes through 1977. He was honored as a Disney Legend in 1991, the first person to receive the award in the voice category. His final role was Hobe Carpenter, a friendly moonshiner who helps Harley Thomas (David Carradine) in &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; (1977). A majority of his roles were inherited by voice actor Jim Cummings following his death.

===Radio and recordings===
Holloway acted on many radio programs, including &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Suspense,&quot; &quot;Lux Radio Theater,&quot; and &quot;The Shadow.&quot; In the late 1940s, he could be heard in various roles on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. His voice retained a touch of its Southern drawl and was instantly recognizable. Holloway was chosen to narrate many children&#x27;s records, including &quot;Uncle Remus Stories&quot; (Decca), &quot;Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes&quot; (Disneyland Records), &quot;Walt Disney Presents Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Just So Stories&quot; (Disneyland Records) and &quot;Peter And The Wolf&quot; (RCA Victor).

===Television===
Holloway easily made the transition from radio to television. He appeared on the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; as &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot;, an eccentric inventor, and played a recurring role on &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;. He guest-starred on Fred Waring&#x27;s CBS television program in the 1950s and appeared on &quot;Circus Boy&quot; as a hot air balloonist. Some other series on which he performed include &quot;Five Fingers&quot; (episode &quot;The Temple of the Swinging Doll&quot;), &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; (&quot;The Jinx&quot;), &quot;Hazel&quot;, &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s in the Box&quot;), &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Donald O&#x27;Connor Show&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;F Troop&quot;, and &quot;Moonlighting&quot;.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Holloway had live parts in two of &quot;The Bell System Science Series&quot; educational films, and a voice part in a third.

During the 1970s, Holloway did commercial voice-overs for Purina Puppy Chow dog food and sang their familiar jingle, &quot;Puppy Chow/For a full year/Till he&#x27;s full-grown!&quot; He also provided the voice for Woodsy Owl in several 1970s and 1980s United States Forest Service commercials. He auditioned for the well-known comic book character Garfield in 1982, but lost to Lorenzo Music. He provided voice-over work for the 1984 commercial of Libby&#x27;s baked beans.

==Personal life and death==
Holloway was a registered Republican and supported the candidacy of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election. In addition, Holloway adhered to Methodism. Throughout his life, Holloway remained a bachelor. He once said this was because he felt lacking in nothing and did not wish to disturb his pattern of life. He adopted a son, Richard Holloway.

Fellow &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; cast member Hal Smith (who originated the character Owl) had taken over the role of Winnie the Pooh for the 1981 short &quot;Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons&quot;. Holloway was given the chance to return to the role for &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; but, at 83 years old, could no longer perform the voice as he had in the past; Jim Cummings took over the role as well as most of Holloway&#x27;s other voice roles, including Kaa in &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;. Holloway died of a cardiac arrest at the Good Samaritan Hospital on November 22, 1992. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

===Art collection===

Holloway was an avid art collector, important in the early careers of many local Los Angeles area artists such as Edward Kienholz and Billy Al Bengston. His large, eclectic, and mostly contemporary collection was sold off piecemeal prior to his death due to his failing health. The collection was a central element in his life outside of his work, building his home on a hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Laguna Beach, California to serve primarily as a gallery in which to display his collection. His instructions to his architect, Paul Sterling Hoag, were that it should be the home &quot;primarily for his paintings and sculpture and only secondarily for himself.&quot; The design of the house included unique elements such as large built-in flat file drawers to hold prints and other unmounted works from his collection as well as features specifically designated for certain notable artworks, such as the commissioned revolving wooden sunshade panels made by Robert Cremean which faced the setting sun, and sculptured front doors by John Mason. The whole layout of the house was optimized for the appreciation of the displayed works of art, more similar to the design of a gallery than a home.

<text>Mount Collie is a mountain in Yoho National Park, located on the western boundary of the Wapta Icefield in Canada. The mountain was named in 1897 by Charles S. Thompson after J. Norman Collie, an accomplished mountaineer and early explorer of the Canadian Rockies.

==Geology==

Mount Collie is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Collie is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<text>Bitter Lake is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, named after its most notable feature, Bitter Lake. It was a mostly natural forest of Douglas-fir and Western Redcedar, inhabited by Native Americans, until the late 19th century. Development especially picked up when the Seattle-to-Everett Interurban streetcar reached the lake in 1906. A sawmill operated in the area until 1913, when most of the trees had been cut down.

==Geography==
To its east, across Aurora Avenue N., is the neighborhood of Haller Lake; to its west, across Greenwood Avenue N., is Broadview; to its north, across N. 145th Street, is the city of Shoreline; and to its south is Greenwood. N. 130th Street is often considered its southern boundary, although some place it further south, at N. 125th Street, N. 115th Street, or even N. 105th Street.

==History==

Bitter Lake played a more prominent role in Seattle at mid-20th century when it was not yet officially part of the city. From May 24, 1930 to 1961, it was home to Playland, one of several amusement parks built by the Washington Amusement Company. It was purchased a year after it opened by Carl E. Phare, a designer and builder of roller coasters, who designed The Dipper, a roller coaster with of track and a maximum altitude of . Other notable attractions included The Canals of Venice, of darkness that may have been Seattle&#x27;s most famous makeout spot for two generations, and a hardwood floor dance pavilion. During the Great Depression, it was home to dance marathons and flagpole sitting contests.

The amusement park, with parking for 12,000 cars, closed at the end of the 1961 season, under three economic pressures: the rise of television, the rising value of its lakefront real estate, and the impending Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle world&#x27;s fair), which would dwarf a relatively small amusement park on the edge of town.

Part of the site of Playland is now the R.H. Thomson Elementary School; the Bitter Lake Community Center sits near the onetime site of the Dipper.

==Parks and recreation==
The neighborhood is home to Bitter Lake Park. A $2.5 million renovation began in 2023 to its restrooms and for the installation of new playground equipment that would bring the park into compliance with various codes for safety and accessibility.

<doc id="805455" wikidata="Q539451" url="?curid=805455" title="Daisy Fellowes">
<text>Daisy Fellowes (&quot;née&quot; Marguerite Séverine Philippine Decazes de Glücksberg; 29 April 1890 – 13 December 1962) was a prominent French socialite, acclaimed beauty, minor novelist and poet, Paris editor of American &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, fashion icon, and an heiress to the Singer sewing machine fortune.

==Parents and childhood==
Born in Paris, France, she was the only daughter of Isabelle-Blanche Singer (1869–1896) and Jean Élie Octave Louis Sévère Amanien Decazes de Glücksberg (1864–1912), 3rd Duke Decazes and Duke of Glücksberg. Her maternal grandfather was Isaac Singer, the American sewing machine pioneer. After her mother&#x27;s suicide, she and her siblings were largely raised by their maternal aunt, Winnaretta Singer (Princess Edmond de Polignac), a noted patron of the arts, particularly music.

==First marriage==
Her first husband, whom she married on 10 May 1910 in Paris, was Jean Amédée Marie Anatole de Broglie, Prince de Broglie (born in Paris on 27 January 1886). He reportedly died of influenza on 20 February 1918 while serving with the French Army in Mascara, Algeria, though there was gossip that he actually committed suicide as a result of his homosexuality having been exposed.

Their country estate was Compton Beauchamp House in Oxfordshire, where they raised three daughters: 
* Princess Emmeline Isabelle Edmée Séverine de Broglie (Neuilly, 16 February 1911 – Onez, Switzerland, 10 September 1986). Married to Marie Alexandre William Alvar de Biaudos, Comte de Castéja (Paris, 6 April 1907 – Paris, 6 July 1983) in Neuilly, 8 November 1932. Accused of collaboration during World War II, Emmeline de Castéja spent five months in the prison at Fresnes, France. 
* Princess Isabelle Marguerite Jeanne Pauline de Broglie (Lamorlaye, 27 July 1912 – Geneva, 18 July 1960). Married to Olivier Charles Humbert Marie, Marquis de La Moussaye (La Poterie, 26 Mars 1908 – Paris, 20 October 1988) in Neuilly, 3 June 1931. Divorced in Paris, 13 April 1945. Isabelle de La Moussaye was a novelist. 
* Princess Jacqueline Marguerite de Broglie (Paris, 5 January 1918 – Crans-Montana, Valais 26 February 1965). Married to Alfred Ignaz Maria Kraus (Sarajevo, 28 November 1908–) in Neuilly, France, 6 October 1941. Divorced in Münster, 3 February 1958. After her husband—a Siemens electronics senior manager who served as a counter-espionage agent with the Abwehr— was accused of betraying members of the French Resistance during World War II to protect his wife, also a member of the Resistance, Jacqueline Kraus had her head shaved as punishment. 

Of her Broglie children, the notoriously caustic Fellowes once said, &quot;The eldest, Emmeline, is like my first husband only a great deal more masculine; the second, Isabelle, is like me without guts; [and] the third, Jacqueline, was the result of a horrible man called Lischmann ...&quot;

==Second marriage==
Her second husband, whom she married on 9 August 1919 in London, was The Hon. Reginald Ailwyn Fellowes (1884–1953), of Donnington Grove. He was a banker, cousin of Winston Churchill and the son of William Fellowes, 2nd Baron de Ramsey.

They had one child, Rosamond Daisy Fellowes (1921–1998). She married her first husband in 1941 (divorced 1945), Captain James Gladstone, and had one son, James Reginald (born 1943). She married her second husband in 1953 (divorced), Tadeusz Maria Wiszniewski (1917–2005); they had one daughter, Diana Marguerite Mary Wiszniewska (born 1953).

==Affairs==
Among Fellowes&#x27;s lovers was Duff Cooper, the British ambassador to France. She also attempted to seduce Winston Churchill, but failed, shortly before marrying his cousin Reginald Fellowes.

==Literary works==
Fellowes wrote several novels and at least one epic poem. Her best-known work is &quot;Les dimanches de la comtesse de Narbonne&quot; (1931, published in English as &quot;Sundays&quot;). She also wrote the novel &quot;Cats in the Isle of Man&quot;.

==Status as fashion icon==
She was known as one of the most daring fashion plates of the 20th century, arguably the most important patron of the surrealist couturier Elsa Schiaparelli. She was also a friend of the jeweller Suzanne Belperron, and she was a longtime customer of the jeweller Cartier.

==Death==
Daisy Fellowes died on 13 December 1962 at her &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; in Paris at number 69, rue de Lille.

<doc id="805465" wikidata="Q1367446" url="?curid=805465" title="A-003">
<text>A-003 was the fourth abort test of the Apollo spacecraft. This particular flight is notable because during the abort test flight, an actual abort situation occurred, and further proved the Apollo launch escape system (LES). The CM was successfully pulled away from the malfunctioning Little Joe booster and it landed safely under parachutes.

==Objectives==
Apollo mission A-003 was the fourth mission to demonstrate the abort capability of the Apollo launch escape system. The purpose of this flight was to demonstrate launch escape vehicle performance at an altitude approximating the upper limit for the canard subsystem.

The launch vehicle was similar to the one used for mission A-002 except that the propulsion system consisted of six Algol motors. The uncrewed flight test vehicle consisted of an Apollo boilerplate command and service module (BP-22) and a launch escape system similar to the one used on the previous mission. The command module Earth landing system configuration was refined to be more nearly like that of the planned production system, and a forward heat shield jettisoning system was provided.

==Flight==

The test vehicle was launched on May 19, 1965, at 6:01:04 a.m. M.S.T. (13:01:04 UTC). Within 2.5 seconds after lift-off, a launch malfunction caused the vehicle to go out of control. The launch vehicle entered into a roll which caused it to break up before second-stage ignition, and a low-altitude abort was initiated instead of the planned high-altitude abort. The launch escape system canard surfaces deployed and survived the severe environment. The high roll rates (approximately 260 degrees per second at the time of canard deployment) induced by the launch vehicle malfunction stabilized the launch escape vehicle in a tower-forward attitude, which overcame the destabilizing effect of the canards. Post-flight simulations verified the ineffectiveness of the canards at the high roll rate, but showed that canards would be effective at the 20 degree per second roll rate limit of the Saturn emergency detection system.

All spacecraft systems operated satisfactorily. The command module forward heat shield was protected by the hard portion of the boost protective cover and was jettisoned satisfactorily in an apex-forward attitude at low altitude. The soft portion of the boost protective cover remained intact until tower jettison. At tower jettison, part of the cover stayed with the command module for a short time although the rest of the cover moved away with the tower. The hard portion of the boost protective cover remained intact until ground impact. Both drogue parachutes inflated, even under the severe conditions that existed; that is, command module apex forward and rolling. The command module was effectively stabilized and oriented for deployment of the main parachutes.

Because of the early launch vehicle breakup, the desired altitude of 120,000 feet (36.6 km) was not achieved. However, the spacecraft did demonstrate a successful low-altitude abort at 12,400 ft (3.8 km) from a rapidly rolling (approximately 335 degrees per second) launch vehicle. The Mach number, dynamic pressure, and altitude at the time of abort were similar to Saturn IB or Saturn V launch trajectory conditions.

==Boilerplate location==
The BP-22 boilerplate is on display at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.

<text>is a Buddhist temple in Ukyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. In 811 Kūkai is said to have founded a temple, then Honen altered it to the present Nenbutsuji. Situated high on a hill overlooking the city from the northwest, it sits in an area where since the Heian period people abandoned the bodies of the dead, exposing them to the wind and rain. Now, some eight thousand Buddhist statuettes, which had been scattered around Adashino then collected about 1903, memorialize the souls of the dead. During its well-known &#x27;sento kuyo&#x27; ceremony dedicated to the spirits of the dead on the evenings of 23 and 24 August, about ten thousand stone statues are lit up with candles.

In its name, &quot;Adashino&quot; is a place name; &quot;Nenbutsu&quot; refers to a mantra (recitation of a buddha&#x27;s name).

<doc id="805496" wikidata="Q329316" url="?curid=805496" title="The Black Cauldron (film)">
<text>The Black Cauldron is a 1985 American animated dark fantasy adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions in association with Silver Screen Partners II and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the first two books in &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; by Lloyd Alexander, a series of five novels that are in turn based on Welsh mythology.

Set in the mythical land of Prydain during the Early Middle Ages, the film centers on a wicked emperor known as the Horned King, who hopes to secure an ancient magical cauldron that will aid him in his desire to conquer the world. He is opposed by young swineherder Taran, the young Princess Eilonwy, the harp-playing bard Fflewddur Fflam, and a friendly wild creature named Gurgi, who seek to destroy the cauldron to prevent the Horned King from ruling the world.

The film is directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich, who had directed Disney&#x27;s previous animated film &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981), and was the first Disney animated film to be recorded in Dolby Stereo. Disney acquired the film rights to the books in 1973 with production beginning in 1980 to be set for a Christmas 1984 release. Several scenes, in particular the film&#x27;s climax, were found to be disturbing to children during a test screening. The newly appointed Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered the scenes to be cut, which caused its release to be delayed to 1985. It features the ensemble voice cast of Grant Bardsley, Susan Sheridan, Freddie Jones, Nigel Hawthorne, Arthur Malet, John Byner, Lindsay Rich, Brandon Call, Gregory Levinson, Eda Reiss Merin, Adele Maus-Morey, Billie Hayes, Phil Fondacaro, Peter Renaday, James Almanzar, Wayne Allwine, Steve Hale, Phil Nibbelink, Jack Laing, and John Hurt, with John Huston serving as the narrator for the prologue.

It was the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating, as well as the first Disney animated film to feature computer-generated imagery. &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was distributed theatrically through Buena Vista Distribution on July 24, 1985. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Being the most expensive animated film ever made at the time, it was a box-office bomb, grossing just $21.3 million against a budget of $44 million, putting the future of Disney&#x27;s animation department in jeopardy. Because of its commercial failure, Disney did not release the film on home media until 1997. It has since gained a cult following.

== Plot ==

In the land of Prydain, Taran, a teenage &quot;assistant pig-keeper&quot; on the farm of Caer Dallben, home of Dallben the Enchanter, dreams of becoming a famous warrior. Dallben learns that the evil Horned King is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which can create an invincible army of undead warriors known as the Cauldron-Born. Dallben fears that the Horned King might use his pig, Hen Wen, who has oracular powers, to locate the cauldron. He directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety, but the pig is captured by Gwythaints, the Horned King&#x27;s wyvern-like creatures.

Taran follows them to the Horned King&#x27;s castle and meets the pestering badger-like creature, Gurgi, who wants to be his friend. Taran helps Hen Wen escape but is captured and thrown into the dungeon. Another captive named Princess Eilonwy frees him. In the catacombs, Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king. Taran arms himself with the king&#x27;s sword, which contains magic that allows him to fight the Horned King&#x27;s minions. Along with a third prisoner, comical bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape and are found by Gurgi. The Horned King sends the Gwythaints to capture Taran and his friends.

Following Hen Wen&#x27;s trail, the group stumbles into the underground kingdom of the Fair Folk, who have Hen Wen under their protection. When the kindly King Eidilleg reveals the cauldron&#x27;s location, Taran decides to destroy it. Eidilleg&#x27;s obnoxious right-hand man Doli is assigned to lead the friends to the Marshes of Morva while the Fair Folk escort Hen Wen back to Dallben. At Morva, they learn the cauldron is held by three witches—leader Orddu, greedy Orgoch, and benevolent Orwen. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran&#x27;s sword and he reluctantly agrees. The witches then reveal the cauldron is indestructible, and its power can only be broken when someone willingly climbs into it, which will kill them. Taran feels foolish for trading the sword for nothing but his companions show their belief in him. They are captured by the Horned King&#x27;s minions and Gurgi flees. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world.

Gurgi, deciding not to abandon his friends this time, rescues them. Taran decides to jump into the cauldron to save everyone, but Gurgi jumps in instead, killing the Cauldron-born as well as himself. The cauldron begins consuming anything within its vicinity. Taran is confronted by the Horned King, who attempts to sacrifice him to the Cauldron. Before he can succeed, the Horned King is dragged into the Cauldron and violently ripped apart, which destroys the castle.

The three witches arrive to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. Taran has realized Gurgi&#x27;s true friendship, and asks them to revive his friend in exchange for the cauldron, choosing to give up his sword. The witches honor the request and Gurgi is resurrected, much to everyone&#x27;s joy. Taran and Eilonwy kiss and the four friends journey back home to Dallben. Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In 1964, Lloyd Alexander began publishing his five-volume series &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;, with the first installment titled &quot;The Book of Three&quot;. According to Joe Hale, Lenore Duckwall, the wife of production manager Don Duckwall, had read the books and suggested an adaptation to her husband. Don Duckwall then showed the books to Wolfgang &quot;Woolie&quot; Reitherman, who agreed to adapt the series into an animated film. Hale further noted, &quot;The [Disney] Studio pictures at that time were not appealing to teenagers, who were the bulk of the audience in the theaters ... They wanted to make a PG-rated picture that would attract an older audience.&quot; Walt Disney Productions optioned Alexander&#x27;s five-volume series in 1971. Pre-production work began in 1973 when the film rights to Alexander&#x27;s books were finally obtained. According to Ollie Johnston, he and Frank Thomas supported the film adaptation, and that if it had been done properly, it might have been &quot;as good as &quot;Snow White&quot;&quot;. Because of the numerous storylines, and with over thirty characters in the original series, several story artists and animators worked on the film&#x27;s development throughout the 1970s.

When &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977) was completed, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was tentatively scheduled to be released in 1980. Veteran artist Mel Shaw created preliminary conceptual pastel sketches, which future Disney president and CEO Ron Miller considered to be too advanced for the newly-hired animators. Therefore, by August 1978, the studio had pushed its release date back to Christmas 1984 due to their inability to animate realistic human characters; its original release date was later assumed by &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981). During its development limbo, storyboard artist Vance Gerry drew panels of beat storyboards that outlined the plot, action, and locations. Having established the three principal characters, Gerry adapted the Horned King into a big-bellied Viking who had a red beard, fiery temper, and wore a steel helmet with two large horns. Meanwhile, Miller hired Rosemary Anne Sisson as they desired an experienced British screenwriter for the film.

Animator John Musker was the film&#x27;s initial director, having been offered the position by production head Tom Wilhite. As director, Musker was assigned to expand several sequences in the first act, but they were eventually deemed too comedic. Musker explained, &quot;...the older people I was working with didn&#x27;t like any of my ideas.&quot; When production on &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981) had wrapped, several feature animation directors Art Stevens, Richard Rich, Ted Berman, and Dave Michener became involved in &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;. When Miller decided too many people were involved, he decided Stevens was not appropriate to supervise the project so he contacted Joe Hale, who was a longtime layout artist at Disney Studios, to serve as producer. Hale, who had finished animation special effects work on &quot;The Watcher in the Woods&quot; (1980), initially declined the offer due to his friendship with Art Stevens, and wanting to continue working on live-action projects. Miller replied regardless of his involvement or not, Stevens would be replaced. After a reconsideration, Hale accepted the offer.

With Hale as producer, actual production on &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; officially began in 1980. He discarded visual character artwork submitted by Tim Burton, and along with Rich and Berman, they desired a &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959)–styled visual approach. Both directors brought Milt Kahl out of retirement to create new character designs for Taran, Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, and the other principal characters. Hale and the story team (including two story artists David Jonas and Al Wilson that he added) heavily revised the film, by which they capsulized the stories of the first two books. They also made some considerable changes, which led to Sisson&#x27;s departure as she developed creative differences with Hale and the directors.

Musker and Ron Clements, also citing creative differences, were removed from the project and began development on &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986). Displeased with Gerry&#x27;s concept for the Horned King, Hale turned the Horned King into a thin creature donning a hood and carrying a spectral presence with shadowed face and glowing red eyes. His role was then expanded into a composite villain of several characters from the books. Taran and Eilonwy eventually acquired elements of the past designs and costumes of earlier Disney characters, especially the latter, who was drawn to resemble Princess Aurora.

===Casting===
According to Musker, Gary Burghoff of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; fame had auditioned as Gurgi. He tried numerous vocal iterations since Ted Berman had no idea how the character should sound. After three hours, the directors grew frustrated and Burghoff, who had refused to leave, was thrown out of the studio. By 1982, John Byner, an impressionist, had been cast in the part. After Byner was shown the character concepts for Gurgi, he felt inspired to add a &quot;child&#x27;s inflection&quot; when creating the voice.

In January 1981, Hayley Mills stated she was being considered for the voice of Eilonwy. That same year, Mills hosted an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World&quot;, in which she met with Hale and the directors to discuss the part. The role eventually went to Susan Sheridan. According to Sheridan, she recorded the voice on three separate trips to the Disney studios. In a 1983 Disney Channel special titled &quot;Backstage at Disney&quot;, Hale stated that Jonathan Winters was voicing King Eidilleg. The role eventually went to Arthur Malet.

=== Test-screening and editing ===
Shortly before the film&#x27;s initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening for the rough cut of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was held at the studio&#x27;s private theater in Burbank, California. After the film, particularly the climactic &quot;cauldron-born&quot; sequence, proved to be too intense and disturbing for the children in the audience, the newly appointed Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered certain scenes from &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; be cut, as a result of the length and the fear that their nature would alienate children. Since animated films were generally edited in storyboard form using Leica reels (later known as animatics: storyboards shot sequentially and set to temporary audio tracks), producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenberg&#x27;s demands. Katzenberg responded by having the film brought into an edit bay and editing the film himself.

Informed of what Katzenberg was doing by Hale, the newly appointed Disney CEO Michael Eisner called Katzenberg in the editing room and convinced him to stop. Though he did what Eisner insisted, Katzenberg requested that the film be modified, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked.

The film was ultimately cut by twelve minutes, with existing scenes rewritten and reanimated for continuity. Many of the deleted scenes involved extended character interactions, but other edits involved violent content, including the undead &quot;Cauldron-Born&quot;, who are used as the Horned King&#x27;s army in the film&#x27;s final act. While most of the scenes were seamlessly removed from the film, the Cauldron-Born sequence contains rather recognizable lapses because the removal of the scenes of the Cauldron-Born mauling the henchmen, as well as one of them being dissolved by the mist, creates a jump in the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

=== Animation ===
Invented by David W. Spencer from the studio&#x27;s still camera department, the animation photo transfer process (APT) was first used for &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; which would enhance the technology by which the rough animation would be processed onto celluloid. First, the rough animation would be photographed onto high-contrast lithographic film, and the resulting negative would be copied onto the plastic cel sheets that would transfer lines and the colors which eventually eliminated the hand-inking process. However, as the APT-transferred line art would fade off of the cels over time, most of the film&#x27;s animation was done using the xerographic process, which had been used by Disney since the late 1950s. Spencer would win a technical Academy Award for this process, but the computer would soon render the APT process obsolete.

&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; is notable for being Disney&#x27;s first animated feature film to incorporate computer-generated imagery in its animation for bubbles, a boat, a floating orb of light, and the cauldron itself. Though &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was released a year before &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, both films were in production simultaneously for some time and the computer graphics for the latter were done first. When producer Joe Hale heard about what was being done, the possibilities made him excited and he made the crew from &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; project create some computer animation for his own film. For other effects, animator Don Paul used live action footage of dry ice mists to create the steam and smoke coming out of the cauldron.

The film was the last Disney animated film to be completed at the original Animation Building of the Walt Disney Studios (Walt Disney Productions) in Burbank, California. The animation department was moved to the Air Way facility in nearby Glendale in December 1984, and following corporate restructuring, eventually returned to the Burbank studio in the mid-1990s at a new facility.

== Soundtrack ==

Unlike most other Disney animated films, the film did only contain the musical score instead of having any lyrics because there was a lot a talk during the film instead of singing. The score which is composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein; he used the ondes Martenot to build upon the dark mood of Prydain, an instrument he used in &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983) and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984).

Due to last minute revisions, much of Bernstein&#x27;s score was cut from the film. In its minority, the score was re-recorded for the album original release by Varèse Sarabande in 1985, with the composer conducting the Utah Symphony Orchestra. The album soon fell out of print and many of the film&#x27;s tracks did not resurface until a bootleg copy entitled &quot;Taran&quot; was supplied to soundtrack specialty outlets in 1986. The film tracks received their premiere release in 2012 as part of Intrada Records&#x27; partnership with Walt Disney Records to issue several Disney film soundtracks.

== Release ==
For its initial release, the film became the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association. It was also presented in Super Technirama 70—the first since &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;—and Dolby Stereo 70mm six-track surround sound. The film&#x27;s initial theatrical release was accompanied by the Donald Duck short &quot;Chips Ahoy&quot;.

The film was re-released in 1990 in selected markets under the title &quot;Taran and the Magic Cauldron&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was released in North America on July 24, 1985. While officially budgeted by Disney executives at $25 million, the film&#x27;s production manager, Don Hahn, said in his documentary, &quot;Waking Sleeping Beauty&quot;, that it cost $44 million to produce the film, making it the most expensive animated film ever made at the time. The film grossed $21.3 million domestically, putting the future of the animation department in jeopardy and earning it the nickname &quot;the film that almost killed Disney&quot;. The film was not only outgrossed by &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, an animated feature with a significantly lower budget, but also by a rerelease of the studios&#x27; own &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;. Unlike most animated Disney features, it was not rereleased to theaters every seven years. It was also not distributed on home video until thirteen years after its theatrical run. The film was however more successful outside North America, notably in France, where it had 3,074,481 admissions and was the fifth most attended film of the year.

== Reception and legacy ==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . The critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Ambitious but flawed, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; is technically brilliant as usual, but lacks the compelling characters of other Disney animated classics.&quot; On Metacritic, the film had a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising the film as &quot;a rip-roaring tale of swords and sorcery, evil and revenge, magic and pluck and luck... And it takes us on a journey through a kingdom of some of the more memorable characters in any recent Disney film.&quot; He noted how &quot;involving&quot; the story was, and felt &quot;the key to the movie is in the richness of the characterizations, and the two best characters, I think, are the Horned King and a fuzzy little creature named Gurgi.&quot;

Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;highly dimensional sound track, with its opulent Elmer Bernstein score and excellent vocal performances, is a technological work of art. But it is the animation itself with some of the best work the studio has produced since Walt Disney&#x27;s death in 1966 that dazzles the viewer.&quot; He felt that if &quot;its script and direction were equal to the animation, &quot;Cauldron&quot; would be a masterpiece to rank with &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, instead of the frustrating, beautiful, exciting and ultimately unsatisfying film that it is.&quot;

Walter Goodman, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the animation and John Hurt&#x27;s performance, but believed &quot;[p]eople old enough to recall their delight at earlier feature animations, no doubt burnished by memory, are not of course the audience at which &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; is aimed. Nor, apparently, is it aimed at youngsters who have had a taste of more sophisticated animation of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; breed of movies.&quot;

London&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine deemed it &quot;a major disappointment&quot;, adding that &quot;the charm, characterization and sheer good humor&quot; found in previous Disney efforts &quot;are sadly absent&quot;.

Charles Champlin, also from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; lacks &quot;the simplicity and the clarity of great fairy tales, or the child-sized wonder of Margery Sharp&#x27;s stories that became &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, the last really successful Disney animated feature. One wonderful chase in the old riotously inventive slapstick tradition and two minor comic figures suggest the pleasures that can result when the inventing animators have a fertile ground to start from. But a lot of the way the film seems to be dutifully following a rather cumbersome and not overly attractive story.&quot;

Jeffrey Katzenberg, then-chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, was dismayed by the product and the animators believed that it lacked &quot;the humor, pathos, and the fantasy which had been so strong in Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s work. The story had been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and it was heartbreaking to see such wonderful material wasted.&quot;

Lloyd Alexander, the author of the books on which the film was based, had a more complicated reaction to the film:
First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable. I had fun watching it. What I would hope is that anyone who sees the movie would certainly enjoy it, but I&#x27;d also hope that they&#x27;d actually read the book. The book is quite different. It&#x27;s a very powerful, very moving story, and I think people would find a lot more depth in the book.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was first released on VHS in the United Kingdom in 1997, and in the United States on August 4, 1998, as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection&quot;, in a pan-and-scan transfer, 13 years after its theatrical release. The film received a DVD release with a 2.20:1 non-anamorphic widescreen transfer in 2000, as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection&quot; line, featuring an art gallery, a new game &quot;The Quest for the Black Cauldron&quot;, and the 1952 Donald Duck short &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;. In 2008, Disney announced a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD release of the film to be released in 2009, but was re-advertised as a &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; and released on September 14, 2010, in the US and UK. It contained the original 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, the new &quot;Witch&#x27;s Challenge&quot; game, an unfinished deleted scene, and all of the features from the 2000 DVD release.

In November 2019, the film was released in 4K for the launch of Disney+. On May 4, 2021, the film was released on Blu-ray exclusively through Disney Movie Club.

=== Theme parks ===
Costumed versions of the characters from the film have made occasional appearances at the Disney Parks and Resorts mostly in Fantasyland.

In 1986, the eatery Lancer&#x27;s Inn at Walt Disney World, was renamed Gurgi&#x27;s Munchings and Crunchings. Eventually, in 1993 it was closed and then remodeled into Lumiere&#x27;s Kitchen, The Village Fry Shoppe, and currently The Friar&#x27;s Nook.

On July 11, 1986, Tokyo Disneyland opened Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour, a walk-through attraction in which the Horned King makes an appearance. The attraction was in operation until 2006. To tie in with the attraction&#x27;s opening, a 14-day special event and castle show &quot;The Mystery of Cinderella Castle&quot; was featured on the Cinderella Castle Forecourt Stage, featuring Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy, with Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, and Maleficent from &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. During the battle against Maleficent&#x27;s forces by Goofy, Donald, Phillip, and Aurora, a cameo appearance is made by Creeper with other Disney villains.

=== Video games ===

The video game &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was designed by Al Lowe of Sierra On-Line and released in 1986. It was made shortly after the first &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; game, and it resembles that adventure in many ways. Along with &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.

The world-building video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; includes Taran, Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi and the Horned King as playable characters, and attractions based on the Horned King&#x27;s Castle and Fairfolk Whirlpool, as well as some establishments and decorations based on the film.

=== In other media ===
Like other Disney animated characters, the characters of the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. During the episode &quot;House of Magic&quot;, Daisy Duck uses the Black Cauldron for a magic show, although with disastrous results.

The plot of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; has a major focus on the direct-to-video anthology film &quot;Once Upon a Halloween&quot;, showing several scenes as flashbacks. In said film it is also mentioned that one of the cauldrons that belonged to the Witches of Morva is now the property of the Evil Queen (from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;).

Along with other Walt Disney Animation Studios characters, the main characters of the film have cameo appearances in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

== Related future project ==
In 2016, Walt Disney Pictures had re-acquired the film rights to &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;, on which the animated feature film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was based, with the intention to adapt the book series into a live-action feature film series. The project was in early development at the Walt Disney Studios with no director, producer, or screenwriter attached yet. Since then, there have been no further reports about the project.

<text>Richard Rafe Champion de Crespigny (born 1936), also known by his Chinese name Zhang Leifu (), is an Australian sinologist and historian. He is an adjunct professor in the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University. He specialises in the history, geography, and literature of the Han dynasty, particularly the translation and historiography of material concerning the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period.

==Family==
The son of Richard Geoffrey Champion de Crespigny, (1907-1966), and Kathleen Cavenagh Champion de Crespigny (1908-2013), née Cudmore, Richard Rafe Champion de Crespigny was born in Adelaide in 1936. He married Christa Boltz in Turner, Australian Capital Territory on 19 May 1959.

== Education ==
De Crespigny received his tertiary education at the University of Cambridge (B.A. Honours History 1957; M.A. History 1961) and the Australian National University (B.A. Honours Chinese 1962; M.A. Oriental Studies Honours 1964; PhD Far Eastern History 1968).

During his early years as a scholar and academic, de Crespigny benefited from the guidance of Geoffrey Elton and sinologists such as Hans Bielenstein, Otto van der Sprenkel, Fang Chao-ying, Liu Ts&#x27;un-yan, and Göran Malmqvist, and he developed an interest in the late Han dynasty through the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. His doctoral dissertation of 1968 on the development of the Chinese empire in the south and the origins of the Three Kingdoms state of Eastern Wu has provided the basis for much of his later work.

== Publications ==

De Crespigny&#x27;s publications include &quot;China: The Land and its People&quot; (Melbourne, 1971); &quot;China This Century&quot; (Melbourne 1975; 2nd Edition Hong Kong 1992), both discussions of modern China. His most significant works, however, are those concerned with the Later Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. Among these are &quot;Northern Frontier: The Policies and Strategy of the Later Han Empire&quot; (Canberra, 1984); while &quot;Emperor Huan and Emperor Ling&quot; and &quot;To Establish Peace&quot; (Canberra, 1996) provide an annotated translation of the chronicle for the years 157 to 189 (chapters 54 to 59) and 189 to 220 (chapters 59 to 69) from the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; of Sima Guang respectively. He has also published more than twenty articles in Australia and overseas.

&quot;Generals of the South&quot;, published in 1990, narrates the rise of the Sun clan and the formation of the Three Kingdoms tripartite. It builds on the broad range of his translation experience and is telling about his historical interests. Like &quot;Northern Frontier&quot;, the work focuses on strategies, campaigns, and personalities. The approach owes a great deal to the narrative tradition of the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; but &quot;Generals of the South&quot; also discusses the population and development of southern China from the second century AD. In dealing with the military defence of the south via the boundary of the Yangtze River, it presents the best discussion of the Battle of Red Cliffs and early Chinese riverine warfare available in English. The work also provides an important prelude to further research into the political and cultural divisions of the Northern and Southern dynasties.

In 2007, &quot;A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms 23–220 AD&quot; was published by Brill as a companion to Michael Loewe&#x27;s biographical dictionary dealing with the Qin, Former Han, and Xin periods 221 BC – 24 AD (Brill 2000).

De Crespigny&#x27;s more recent publications include &quot;Imperial Warlord&quot;, a biography of Cao Cao (Brill 2010), which was awarded the Stanislas Julien Prize for 2011 by the French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In 2016 Brill published &quot;Fire over Luoyang&quot;, a narrative and analytical history of Later Han. He was brought on as a consultant for the Creative Assembly strategy video game &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot; (released 2019).

== Associations and appointments ==

He has also been President of the Chinese Studies Association of Australia, a Fellow of the Oriental Society of Australasia, a vice-president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs; and a member of the Asian Studies Association of Australia, the Historical Association (UK) and the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia.

<doc id="805527" wikidata="Q609761" url="?curid=805527" title="Little tinamou">
<text>The little tinamou (Crypturellus soui) is a species of tinamou. It is found in Central and South America, as well as on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.

==Etymology==
&quot;Crypturellus&quot; is formed from three Latin or Greek words. &quot;kruptos&quot; meaning covered or hidden, &quot;oura&quot; meaning tail, and &quot;ellus&quot; meaning diminutive. Therefore, &quot;Crypturellus&quot; means small hidden tail.

==Taxonomy==
The little tinamou is one of 21 species in the genus &quot;Crypturellus&quot;, the most species-rich genus of tinamous. All tinamous are in the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also palaeognaths, a group that includes the more widely known flightless ratites such as ostriches and emus. Unlike the ratites, though, tinamous can fly, although in general they are not strong fliers. All palaeognaths evolved from flying ancestors.

===Subspecies===
* &quot;C. s. meserythrus&quot; occurs in southern Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and northern and eastern Nicaragua.
* &quot;C. s. modestus&quot; occurs in Costa Rica and western Panama.
* &quot;C. s. capnodes&quot; occurs in the lowlands of northwestern Panama.
* &quot;C. s. poliocephalus&quot; occurs in Pacific coastal Panama; Veraguas, Herrera, Los Santos, Coclé, and western Panamá Provinces.
* &quot;C. s. caucae&quot; occurs in the Magdalena River valley of north central Colombia.
* &quot;C. s. harterti&quot; occurs on the Pacific slope of Colombia and Ecuador.
* &quot;C. s. mustelinus&quot; occurs in northeastern Colombia and extreme northwestern Venezuela.
* &quot;C. s. caquetae&quot; occurs in southeastern Colombia; Meta Department, Caquetá, Vaupés, and Guaviare Departments.
* &quot;C. s. nigriceps&quot; occurs in eastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru.
* &quot;C. s. soui&quot; occurs in eastern Colombia, eastern and southern Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and northeastern Brazil.
* &quot;C. s. albigularis&quot; occurs in eastern and northern Brazil.
* &quot;C. s. inconspicuus&quot; occurs in northern Bolivia and central and eastern Peru.
* &quot;C. s. andrei&quot; occurs in Trinidad and northern Venezuela; Falcón, Yaracuy, Carabobo, Aragua, Vargas, Miranda, northern Anzoátegui, Sucre, Monagas States, and the Venezuelan Capital District
* &quot;C. s. panamensis&quot; occurs on both coasts of Panama and the Pearl Islands of Panama (an ancient introduction).

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a resident breeder in tropical lowland forests, rivers-edge forests, lowland evergreen forest, secondary forest, and lowland shrublands at an altitude of . They are also fairly successful utilizing cleared forests and plantations or farmed land. 

==Behavior==

Little tinamou are shy, secretive, and pair-solitary animals. Despite their abundance, they are rarely sighted. In the field, they are detected by sound more often than sight. The whistle call is a soft, descending whinny (also a series of single notes, tempo increasing at end) produced by both sexes. They eat seeds, berries, and some insects. They can fly but will run unless flight is necessary. They are highly territorial and will attack when encroached upon if the intruding bird is not their mate. There is evidence that they will maintain the same territory for years.

===Breeding===
The breeding season of the little tinamou ranges from May to October. Nests are a small depression in forest floor, sometimes lined with a few leaves at the base of a tree or in dense brush. Females perform courtship behavior and eggs are incubated by males. Male nest attendance is strong, up to 14 days without leaving the nest in one study. They typically lay two glossy dark-purple eggs (up to three have been observed). The size of the egg is approximately . Young are precocial, and begin pecking the ground on the first day. They can run almost as soon as they hatch. By weeks 3–4 they are capable of full flight. Egg laying begins at one year old.

==Description==
The little tinamou is approximately long and weighs . Although it looks similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, it is unrelated to those groups. It has an unbarred sooty-brown plumage which transitions to grey on the head. The foreneck is whitish. While the underside of both male and female is cinnamon buff, the female is a lighter shade. The legs can be grey, olive, or yellow. Both male and female are almost tailess.

==Conservation==
The IUCN list the little tinamou as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

<doc id="805586" wikidata="Q486236" url="?curid=805586" title="Anarchism in Spain">
<text>Anarchism in Spain has historically gained some support and influence, especially before Francisco Franco&#x27;s victory in the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, when it played an active political role and is considered the end of the golden age of classical anarchism.

There were several variants of anarchism in Spain, namely expropriative anarchism in the period leading up to the conflict, the peasant anarchism in the countryside of Andalusia; urban anarcho-syndicalism in Catalonia, particularly its capital Barcelona; and what is sometimes called &quot;pure&quot; anarchism in other cities such as Zaragoza. However, these were complementary trajectories and had many ideological similarities. Early on, the success of the anarchist movement was sporadic. Anarchists would organize a strike and ranks would swell. Usually, repression by police reduced the numbers again, but at the same time further radicalized many strikers. This cycle helped lead to an era of mutual violence at the beginning of the 20th century in which armed anarchists and , armed men paid by company owners, were both responsible for political assassinations.

In the 20th century, this violence began to fade, and the movement gained speed with the rise of anarcho-syndicalism and the creation of the huge libertarian trade union, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). General strikes became common, and large portions of the Spanish working class adopted anarchist ideas. There also emerged a small individualist anarchist movement based on publications such as and . The (FAI) was created as a purely anarchist association, with the intention of keeping the CNT focused on the principles of anarchism.

Anarchists played a central role in the fight against Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. At the same time, a far-reaching social revolution spread throughout Spain, where land and factories were collectivized and controlled by the workers. All remaining social reforms ended in 1939 with the victory of Franco, who had thousands of anarchists executed. Resistance to his rule never entirely died, with resilient militants participating in acts of sabotage and other direct action after the war, and making several attempts on the ruler&#x27;s life. Their legacy remains important to this day, particularly to anarchists who look at their achievements as a historical precedent of anarchism&#x27;s validity.

== History ==
=== Beginning ===
The closest thing to a radical movement in 19th century Spain was found amongst the followers of the ideas laid out by the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Mutualism had a considerable influence on the Spanish cooperativist movement, which advocated for a peaceful and gradualist approach to defeating capitalism, as well as the federalist movement, which envisioned a society of local municipalities joining together and coordinating without any need for a centralized government. The most influential proponent of mutualism in Spain was the federal republican Francesc Pi i Margall (named, upon his death, &quot;the wisest of the federalists, almost an anarchist&quot; by anarchist thinker Ricardo Mella), who in his book wrote that &quot;every man who has power over another is a tyrant&quot; and called for the &quot;division and subdivision of power&quot;. Another disciple of Proudhon was Ramón de la Sagra, who founded the world&#x27;s first anarchist journal , which was published for a brief time in Galicia. Mutualism subsequently gained widespread popularity throughout Spain, becoming the dominant tendency within the Spanish federal republican movement by the 1860s. It was around this time that the revolutionary socialist ideas of Mikhail Bakunin, based in collectivism, a focus on direct action and a militant anti-clericalism, also began to rise to prominence in Spain.

The earliest successful attempt to introduce anarchism to the Spanish masses was undertaken by a middle-aged Italian revolutionary named Giuseppe Fanelli. An early partisan of the Young Italy movement, during the Italian Revolution Fanelli had given up his career to participate in the Risorgimento under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini. After the proclamation of the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1861, Fanelli was elected to the Italian Parliament as part of Mazzini&#x27;s far-left coalition, before meeting Bakunin and becoming an anarchist. 

Following the Glorious Revolution and the beginning of the in 1868, the new Provisional Government declared the right to freedom of association, allowing Spanish workers&#x27; societies to begin re-emerging from the secrecy that they had previously lived under. Bakunin took this as an opportunity to sponsor Fanelli on a journey to Spain in order to recruit members for the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA), an international organization that aimed to unify groups working for the benefit of the working class. Arriving in Barcelona on a shoestring budget, Fanelli met with and borrowed money from Élie Reclus, in order to finance his trip to Madrid, where he met with the owner of the federal republican newspaper and was put in touch with a group of radical workers.
Fanelli spoke in French and Italian, so those present could only understand bits of what he was saying, except for one man, Tomás González Morago, who knew French. Nevertheless, Fanelli was able to convey his libertarian and anti-capitalist ideas to the audience. Anselmo Lorenzo gave an account of his oratory: &quot;His voice had a metallic tone and was susceptible to all the inflexions appropriate to what he was saying, passing rapidly from accents of anger and menace against tyrants and exploiters to take on those of suffering, regret and consolation...we could understand his expressive mimicry and follow his speech.&quot;

As a result, all the workers that were present at the meeting declared themselves in support of the International and Fanelli subsequently extended his stay in the city, holding &quot;propaganda sessions&quot; with the nascent anarchist adherents - paying particular attention to Anselmo Lorenzo. On January 24, 1869, Fanelli held his last meeting with the anarchist workers of Madrid, in which they declared the establishment of the Madrid section of the IWA. Fanelli explained his decision to leave Spain was so that the anarchists there could develop themselves and their groups &quot;by their own efforts, with their own values,&quot; in order to maintain spontaneity, plurality and individuality within the workers&#x27; movement. The anarchists of the Madrid section subsequently began to spread their ideas by holding meetings, giving speeches, and publishing their newspaper . By 1870, the Madrid chapter of the International had gained roughly 2,000 members.

Fanelli then returned to Barcelona where he held another meeting, attracting a number of more radical students such as Rafael Farga i Pellicer to the idea of anarchism, which subsequently gained a much larger following in Barcelona, already a bastion of proletarian rebellion, Luddism, and trade unionism. In May 1869, Farga i Pellicer spearheaded the establishment of the Barcelona section of the IWA, which began to advocate for socialism within the structures that had already been set up by the 1868 Barcelona Workers&#x27; Congress. The IWA&#x27;s influence was thereby extended to a number of workers&#x27; societies and the federal republican newspaper &quot;La Federación&quot;, quickly bringing thousands of workers under the anarchist banner. Farga i Pellicer even went on to participate in the International&#x27;s Basel Congress as a delegate for the Spanish sections, where he joined Bakunin&#x27;s &quot;International Alliance of Socialist Democracy&quot;.

Anarchism had soon taken root throughout Spain, in villages and in cities, and in scores of autonomous organizations. Many of the rural were already anarchic in structure prior to the spread of &quot;anarchist&quot; ideas. In February 1870, the Madrid section of the IWA published in a call for all Spanish sections to convene a national workers&#x27; congress, which was eventually decided would be held in Barcelona.
On June 18, 1870, the First Spanish Workers&#x27; Congress convened at the , where delegates from 150 workers&#x27; associations met, along with thousands of common workers observing (&quot;occupying every seat, filling the hallways, and spilling out beyond the entrance&quot;. The agenda was closely guided by the anarchists around Rafael Farga i Pellicer, who opened the congress with a declaration against the state and proposed an distinctly anarchist program for the Spanish Regional Federation of the IWA (, FRE-AIT). Despite the clear dominance of anarchism within the Congress, there also existed three other main tendencies: the &quot;associatarians&quot; that were interested in the cultivation of cooperatives, the &quot;politicians&quot; that wanted to mobilize workers to participate in elections, and the &quot;pure-and-simple&quot; trade unionists that were focused on immediate workplace struggles. There was a particularly sharp conflict between the anarchists, who advocated for abstentionism and direct action, and the &quot;politicians&quot;, during which congress took a line of compromise regarding electoralism: allowing individual members to participate in elections if they wished, but also committing itself officially to abstentionism and anti-statism. Congress also adopted a &quot;dual structure&quot; for the FRE-AIT whereby workers would be organized into both trade unions based on their profession and local federations based on their location, which could then federate together from the bottom-up, laying an anti-bureaucratic and decentralist foundation for syndicalism in Spain. 

=== Early turmoil of 1873–1900 ===

During the Cantonal rebellion, several independent cantons rose against the First Spanish Republic. Anarchism had a considerable influence in this series of insurrections especially in the Canton of Cartagena, which was the only canton to last more than a few days.

The anarchist idea was propagated by many periodicals like started by Fermín Salvochea. Salvochea is considered one of the earliest pioneers in the propagation and organization along anarchist lines.

=== Rise of the CNT ===
The anarchist movement lacked a stable national organization in its early years. Anarchist Juan Gómez Casas discusses the evolution of anarchist organization before the creation of the CNT: &quot;After a period of dispersion, the Federation of Workers of the Spanish Region disappeared, to be replaced by the Anarchist Organization of the Spanish Region... This organization then changed, in 1890, into the Solidarity and Assistance Pact, which was itself dissolved in 1896 because of repressive legislation against anarchism and broke into many nuclei and autonomous workers&#x27; societies... The scattered remains of the FRE gave rise to in 1907, the immediate antecedent of the [CNT].&quot;

=== Prelude to revolution ===

An uprising took place in December 1933. Aside from a prison break in Barcelona, no gains were made by revolutionaries before the police quelled the revolt in Catalonia and most of the rest of the country. Zaragoza saw ephemeral insurrection in the form of street fighting and the occupation of certain buildings.

=== Individualist anarchism ===
Spanish individualist anarchism was influenced by American individualist anarchism but it was mainly connected to the French currents. At the start of the 20th century people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as , , , , , , and . The most influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Émile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, Esperanto, anationalism, anarcho-naturism and free love were present as philosophies and practices within Spanish individualist anarchist circles. Later Armand and Ryner started publishing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand&#x27;s concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual.

Historian Xavier Diez wrote on the subject in . deals with free love thought in . Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Giménez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation.

In the 1930s, Miguel Giménez Igualada edited the individualist anarchist magazine , in which many works of Han Ryner and Émile Armand appeared, and also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist magazine . In his youth he engaged in illegalist activities. Igualada&#x27;s thought was deeply influenced by Stirner, of which he was the main popularizer in Spain through his writings.

=== Anarchist presence in the Spanish Civil War ===
The most effective anarchist unit in the Civil War was the Durruti Column, led by militant Buenaventura Durruti. It was the only anarchist unit which managed to gain respect from otherwise fiercely hostile political opponents. In a section of her memoirs which otherwise lambastes the anarchists, Dolores Ibárruri states: &quot;The war developed with minimal participation from the anarchists in its fundamental operations. One exception was Durruti...&quot; (&quot;Memorias de Dolores Ibarruri&quot;, p. 382). The column began with 3,000 troops, but at its peak was made up of about 8,000 men. They had a difficult time getting arms from a fearful Republican government, so Durruti and his men compensated by seizing unused arms from government stockpiles. Durruti&#x27;s death on November 20, 1936, weakened the Column in spirit and tactical ability; they were eventually incorporated, by decree, into the regular army. Over a quarter of the population of Barcelona attended Durruti&#x27;s funeral. It is still uncertain how Durruti died; modern historians tend to agree that it was an accident, perhaps a malfunction with his own gun or a result of friendly fire, but widespread rumors at the time claimed treachery by his men; anarchists tended to claim that he died heroically and was shot by a fascist sniper. Given the widespread repression against Anarchists by the Soviets, which included torture and summary executions, it is also possible that it was a USSR plot.

==== CNT–FAI collaboration with government during the war ====

During the Spanish Civil War, many anarchists outside of Spain criticized the CNT leadership for entering into government and compromising with communist elements on the Republican side. Those in Spain felt that this was a temporary adjustment, and that once Franco was defeated, they would continue in their libertarian ways. There was also concern with the growing power of authoritarian communists within the government. Montseny later explained: &quot;At that time we only saw the reality of the situation created for us: the communists in the government and ourselves outside, the manifold possibilities, and all our achievements endangered.&quot;

=== Franco years ===

When Francisco Franco took power in 1939, he had tens of thousands of political dissidents executed. The total number of politically motivated killings between 1939 and 1943 is estimated to be around 200,000.

<text>Super K Productions was a 1960s American recording production company under Buddah Records, headed by producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz, whose groups specialized in bubblegum pop. Their biggest successes were The Ohio Express, The 1910 Fruitgum Company, Crazy Elephant and The Music Explosion. Super K also had its own label of the same name in 1969, operated under Buddah Records, but it did not last as the bubblegum genre had already started to decline in popularity.

Not a company to depend on double-sided hits, many (but not all) Super K-produced singles were pressed with B-sides of either tracks recorded backwards or studio group instrumentals. This method was also employed earlier by producers Phil Spector and Joe Meek as a way of pointing a radio DJ to the &quot;right&quot; side of the singles.

In the 1970&#x27;s, they had a small Recording Studio and Production office in Great Neck, NY, on East Shore Drive, just north of Northern Blvd. on Long Island.

<text>Kerry Park is a small public park and viewpoint on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, Washington, United States. It overlooks Downtown Seattle and is located along West Highland Drive between 2nd Avenue West and 3rd Avenue West. The park&#x27;s view is considered to offer the most iconic views of the city skyline, with the Space Needle prominent at the center, Elliott Bay to the west, and Mount Rainier in the background.

== Description and history ==
The park encompasses and includes a railing and several benches facing south towards the skyline. A stairway on the west end of the park connects below to West Prospect Street and the Bayview-Kinnear Park, which has a small playground. Kerry Park is named after the couple lumberman and business magnate Albert S. Kerry and his wife Katharine. They lived nearby, and donated the land to the city in 1927 &quot;so that all who stop here may enjoy [its] view.&quot;

At the center of Kerry Park is &quot;Changing Form&quot;, a steel sculpture by artist Doris Totten Chase that stands high and was installed in 1971 with donations from Kerry&#x27;s children. The sculpture is hollow and is popular as a play area for children and as a framing device for photographers. That view from Kerry Park encompasses downtown Seattle, Elliott Bay, the West Seattle peninsula, Bainbridge Island, and Mount Rainier.

The view from the park is often used as the backdrop for television news segments on Seattle, as well as other media depictions of the city. Kerry Park was also featured in the opening credits of the 1999 film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, and in &quot;Frasier&quot; as the view from the titular character&#x27;s apartment.

<text>The rufous-vented chachalaca (Ortalis ruficauda) is a member of an ancient group of birds of the family Cracidae, which are related to the Australasian mound builders. It inhabits northeast Colombia and northern Venezuela where it is called guacharaca, and the island of Tobago in Trinidad and Tobago where it is known as the cocrico and is one of the country&#x27;s two national birds (being featured on the country&#x27;s coat of arms). It is also found on Bequia and Union Island in the Grenadines where it may have been introduced.

==Habitat==
The rufous-vented chachalaca is a largely arboreal species found in forest and woodland, but it is also found in more open dry scrubby areas. This combined with relatively low hunting pressure, make it far less vulnerable than larger members of the family, notably curassows.

==Description==
These are medium-sized birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys, with small heads, long strong legs and a long broad tail. They are typically 53–58 cm long; the female weighs 540g and the larger male 640g. They have fairly dull plumage, dark brown above and paler below. The head is grey, and the brown tail is tipped rufous or white depending on race.

==Call==
As other chachalacas, the rufous-vented chachalaca is a very noisy species, preferring to execute their vocal feats at dawn. The male&#x27;s call is a loud low &quot;ka-ka-rooki-rooki-ka&quot;, answered by the female&#x27;s high-pitched &quot;watch-a-lak&quot;, which they often repeat several times in a row, in precise synchronization.

==Breeding and behaviour==
The species is a social bird, often seen in family groups. It walks along branches seeking the fruit (such as mangoes, berries and those from the &quot;Euterpe&quot; palm), leaves and seeds on which it feeds. It is an able flyer that can even take off and fly vertically, but does not usually fly long distances. The twig nest is built low in a tree, and three or four large white eggs are laid. The female incubates them alone.

==Subspecies==

There are two subspecies:
* &quot;O. r. ruficauda&quot; (Jardine, 1847) - northeast Colombia to northern Venezuela, also Tobago and Isla Margarita
* &quot;O. r. ruficrissa&quot; (Sclater and Salvin, 1870) - northern Colombia and northwest Venezuela

<text>A-004 was the sixth and final test of the Apollo launch escape vehicle and the first flight of a Block I production-type Apollo Command/Service Module.

==Objectives==

Mission A-004 was uncrewed and was conducted to demonstrate that 
# The launch escape vehicle would satisfactorily orient and stabilize itself in the proper attitude after being subjected to a high rate of tumbling during the powered phase of an abort
# The escape vehicle would maintain its structural integrity under test conditions in which the command module structure was loaded to the design limit.

The launch vehicle was the fifth and final Little Joe II flown. The propulsion system consisted of four Algol and five Recruit rocket motors. The attitude control system was similar to the one used on mission A-003 except that the reaction control system was deleted and the vehicle was provided with the capability of responding to a radio-transmitted pitch up command. The 
pitch up maneuver was required to help initiate tumbling of the launch vehicle. The spacecraft for this mission consisted of a modified Block I command and service module (Block I production model 002), and a modified Block I launch escape system (airframe 002). The center of gravity and thrust vector were changed to assure that power-on tumbling would be attained after abort initiation. The Earth landing system was essentially the same as that used during Pad Abort Test 2.

==Flight==

The vehicle was launched on January 20, 1966, at 8:17:01 a.m. MST (15:17:01 UTC) after several postponements due to technical difficulties and adverse weather conditions. The pitch up maneuver was commanded from the ground when telemetry showed that the desired altitude and velocity conditions had been reached. The planned abort was automatically initiated 2.9 seconds later. The launch escape vehicle tumbled immediately after abort initiation. Pitch and yaw rates reached peak values of 160 degrees per second, and roll rates reached a peak of minus 70 degrees per second. The launch escape system canard surfaces deployed at the proper time and stabilized the command module with the aft heat shield forward after the escape vehicle had tumbled about four times. Tower jettison and operation of the Earth landing systems were normal, and the command module landed about 113,620 feet (34.6 km) from the launch pad after having reached a maximum altitude of 78,180 feet (23.8 km) above mean sea level.

All systems performed satisfactorily, and the dynamic loads and structural response values were within the design limits and predicted values. Although a structural loading value of primary interest was not achieved (local differential pressure between the interior and exterior of the command module wall), all test objectives were satisfied.

== Boilerplate location==
The boilerplate spacecraft is currently on display at the Cradle of Aviation Museum, Garden City, New York.

<doc id="805625" wikidata="Q5495995" url="?curid=805625" title="Fred Newman (philosopher)">
<text>Frederick Delano Newman (June 17, 1935 – July 3, 2011) was an American psychotherapist and left-wing political activist.

Newman and Lois Holzman created a therapeutic modality, Social Therapy. Newman insisted &quot;that there was nothing wrong with psychotherapists having sex with patients&quot;.

Along with Lenora Fulani, Newman controlled several socialist and progressive political, therapy, and dramatic collective groups across the USA. These groups promoted &quot;friendosexuality&quot;, which encouraged members to sleep with each other. Newman strongly objected to the classification of these groups as a &quot;cult&quot;, and argued that &quot;there is no such thing as a cult&quot;.

Because Newman&#x27;s organizations frequently changed names, followers of Newman have been called Newmanites or the Newman Tendency.

== Personal life ==
Newman was born in 1935 in The Bronx of New York City. Newman grew up in a working-class neighborhood. He served in the US Army, including a stint in Korea. Then, he attended the City College of New York under the GI Bill. In 1962, he earned a Ph.D. in analytic philosophy and in foundations of mathematics from Stanford University. Newman taught at several colleges and universities in the 1960s, including the City College of New York, Knox College, Case Western Reserve University, and Antioch College.

Newman was twice married and divorced. He had two children, Donald Newman and Elizabeth Newman. He died at his home in Manhattan on July 3 2011, aged 76, was survived by his two life partners, Gabrielle L. Kurlander and Jacqueline Salit, in what Ms. Salit described as an &quot;unconventional family of choice&quot;. 

== Therapeutic theories and work ==
Newman and his primary collaborator, Lois Holzman, challenged what they described as the &quot;hoax/myth of psychology,&quot; the various components of which were termed &quot;destructive pieces of pseudoscience.&quot; In its place, they argued for a theory called &quot;social therapy&quot;.

=== Social therapy ===

Social therapy is characterized as &quot;revolution for non-revolutionaries.&quot; In addition to Marx, it uses the insights of Vygotsky and Wittgenstein. It seeks to enlist &quot;patients&quot; in the collective work of constructing new environments that challenge the commodification of emotionality, and re-ignite human development.

&quot;The Practice of Method&quot;, is the seminal written work on &quot;social therapy&quot;, the first published formulation by Newman and his colleagues of a Marxist approach to therapy. Social therapy came, in later years, to be influenced by other thinkers (notably Vygotsky and Wittgenstein) and other therapeutic approaches (notably cognitive behavioral therapy). &quot;The Practice of Method&quot; exposes the roots of social therapy. It is the beginning of a continuing investigation of method in the study of human growth and development, to which Newman (together with his chief collaborator, Lois Holzman) returns again and again in his later work.

&quot;Undecidable Emotions (What is Social Therapy? And How Is it Revolutionary?)&quot; (Newman, 2003, &quot;Journal of Constructivist Psychology&quot;) seeks to illuminate a revolutionary approach to group therapy by an appeal to – of all things – twentieth century discoveries in science and mathematical logic.

&quot;All Power to the Developing&#x27;&quot; (Newman &amp; Holzman, 2003, &quot;Annual Review of Critical Psychology&quot;) examines the two Marxist notions, class struggle (&quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;) and revolutionary activity (&quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot;). 

=== Marxism, influences, and views ===
Newman considered himself a Marxist, a philosophy that he incorporated into his therapeutic approach in an attempt to address the alienating effects of societal institutions on human development. In his earliest statement of his attempt to develop a Marxist approach to emotional problems, Newman wrote in 1974:

Proletarian or revolutionary psychotherapy is a journey which begins with the rejection of our inadequacy and ends in the acceptance of our smallness; it is the overthrow of the rulers of the mind by the workers of the mind.

Later, Newman incorporated other influences, including the 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and Aleksey Leontyev and Sergei Rubinshtein&#x27;s activity theory, and the work of early Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky.

=== Playwriting, theater, and social therapy ===
Newman was a cofounder (1983), artistic director (1989–2005), and playwright-in-residence of the Castillo Theatre in New York. The theater, named for the Guatemalan poet Otto René Castillo, has served as the primary venue for the production of the 30 plays that Newman wrote since the 1980s, four of which were written for and performed at annual conventions of the American Psychological Association from 1996 onwards. Newman described the Castillo Theatre as a &quot;sister&quot; organization to his social therapy clinics and institutes, where he also used Vygotsky&#x27;s methodological approach. Writing in 2000 in &quot;New Therapist,&quot; Newman and Holzman discussed the Vygotskian thread that linked the sister organizations:

The entire enterprise - human life and its study - is a search for method. Performance social therapeutics, the name we use to describe our Marxian-based, dialectical practice, originated in our group therapy but is also the basis for a continuously emergent development community.

We coined the term tool-and-result methodology for Vygotsky&#x27;s (and our) practice of method in order to distinguish it from the instrumental tool for result methodology that characterizes the natural and social sciences (Newman and Holzman, 1993). Our community building and the projects that comprise it - the East Side Institute for Short Term Psychotherapy, the East Side Center for Social Therapy and affiliated centers in other cities, the Castillo Theatre, the All Stars Talent Show Network, the Development School for Youth, etc. - are practices of this methodology.

The Castillo and its parent charity, the All Stars Project, Inc., supported Newman&#x27;s therapeutic endeavors, such as a number of supplementary education programs for youth, including the Joseph A. Forgione Development School for Youth.

On December 6, 2005, Newman announced his retirement as the Castillo&#x27;s artistic director in the wake of controversy over a six-part series the previous month on NY1 News (a cable television news channel). In a letter to the All Stars Project&#x27;s Board of Directors, Newman explained that he did not &quot;want any of the controversy associated with my views and opinions to create unnecessary difficulties for the All Stars Project.&quot; The cable program contained segments of an interview in which Newman discussed his longstanding opposition to having his therapeutic approach being governed by the American Psychological Association&#x27;s ethical guidelines, notably those prohibiting sexual relations with patients.

=== Anti-semitism allegations ===
Some of Newman&#x27;s plays have been cited as examples of alleged anti-Semitism by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which Newman described as &quot;politically motivated&quot;. In his play &quot;No Room for Zion&quot; (1989), Newman recounts the transition in his own Bronx Jewish community from primarily working class to increasingly middle class and upwardly mobile, rapidly losing its identity as an immigrant community tied to traditional ideals (represented by the Rabbi Zion of the play&#x27;s title). In the play, Newman goes on to present his view of the postwar shifts in Jewish political alignments, both domestically and internationally:

From the West Bank to the West Side of Manhattan, international Jewry was being forced to face its written-in-blood deal with the capitalist devil. In exchange for an unstable assimilation, Jews under the leadership of Zionism would &quot;do-unto-others-what-others-had-done-unto-them.&quot; The others to be done unto? People of color. The doing? Ghettoization and genocide. The Jew, the dirty Jew, once the ultimate victim of capitalism&#x27;s soul, fascism, would become a victimizer on behalf of capitalism, a self-righteous dehumanizer and murderer of people of color, a racist bigot whom in the language of Zionism changed the meaning of &quot;Never Again&quot; from &quot;Never Again for anyone&quot; to &quot;Never again for us – and let the devil take everyone else.

The ADL also criticized the Newman&#x27;s 2004 play, &quot;Crown Heights&quot;, which was based on the 1991 riots sparked by the accidental death of a black child who was struck and killed by the motorcade of a prominent local rabbi. The ADL claimed that the production &quot;distorts history and refuels hatred.&quot; One reviewer considered the production to be one that &quot;seeks to unite the city&#x27;s diverse youth and heal some of the wounds of past racial violence.&quot;

== Political organizations ==

=== Centers for Change ===
Newman founded the collective Centers for Change (CFC) in the late 1960s after the student strikes at Columbia University. CFC was dedicated to 1960s-style, radical community organizing and the practice of Newman&#x27;s evolving form of psychotherapy, which he would term around 1974 &quot;proletarian therapy&quot; and later &quot;Social Therapy.&quot; CFC briefly merged with Lyndon LaRouche&#x27;s National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC) in 1974, but a few months, the alliance fell apart, an event that Newman attributed to LaRouche&#x27;s increasingly &quot;paranoid&quot; and &quot;authoritarian&quot; direction and to the NCLC&#x27;s &quot;capacity to produce psychosis and to opportunistically manipulate it in the name of socialist politics.&quot;

=== International Workers Party ===
In August 1974, the CFC went on to found the International Workers Party (IWP), a revolutionary party that was explicitly Marxist-Leninist. In the wake of another factional fight in 1976, the IWP publicly disbanded. In 2005, Newman told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the IWP had transformed into a &quot;core collective&quot; that still functions. That claim appears to be consistent with critics who had alleged several years earlier that the organization had never actually disbanded and remained secretly active.

Throughout the late 1970s, Newman and his core of organizers founded or assumed control of a number of small grassroots organizations, including a local branch of the People&#x27;s Party, known as the New York Working People&#x27;s Party; the New York City Unemployed and Welfare Council; and the Labor Community Alliance for Change.

=== New Alliance Party ===
In 1979, Newman became one of the founders of the New Alliance Party (NAP), which was most notable for getting African-American psychologist and activist Lenora Fulani on the ballot in all 50 states during her 1988 presidential campaign, making her the first African-American and the first woman to do so. Newman served primarily as the party&#x27;s tactician and campaign manager. In 1985, Newman ran for Mayor of New York. He also ran for US Senator that year and for New York State Attorney General in 1990.

=== Independence Party of New York ===
After the New Alliance Party was dissolved in 1994, a number of its members and supporters, including Newman and Fulani, joined the Independence Party of New York (IPNY). It had been founded by activists in Rochester, New York in 1991 but became more important in other parts of the state after the rise of Ross Perot&#x27;s Reform Party.

In September 2005, the New York State Executive Committee of the Independence Party, under the leadership of IPNY State Chairman Frank MacKay, voted to remove Fulani and several other members. In a letter proposing the matter for vote, MacKay stated Fulani et al. had created the perception that the IPNY leadership tolerated &quot;bigotry and hatred&quot; and had &quot;continually re-affirmed their disturbing social commentary in the state and national press.&quot;

A later petition by MacKay to have Fulani and Newman, among others, disenrolled from the party was entirely dismissed by the New York Supreme Court in both Brooklyn and Manhattan. Manhattan Justice Emily Jane Goodman wrote that &quot;the statements attributed to Fulani and Newman which many would consider odious and offensive were made by them in 1989 and 1985, respectively, and not in their capacity as Independence Party members or officers in the Party which did not even exist at the time.&quot; Goodman noted the timing of the petition appeared &quot;more political than philosophical.&quot; More to the point, however, the petitioned grounds for disenrollment were ruled invalid because &quot;there are no enunciated standards or requirements for persons registering in the Party.&quot; As a result, Newman and Fulani were not removed.

=== New York City municipal bonds ===
Newman strongly encouraged the Independence Party to support Republican candidate Michael Bloomberg in 2001, 2005, and 2009.

In 2002, the New York City Industrial Development Agency (with agreement by the state) approved an $8.5 million bond to help finance a new headquarters for a youth charity controlled by Newman and Lenora Fulani, Newman&#x27;s chief spokesperson and a prominent Independence Party public figure. The media characterized approval of the bond as a reward from Mayor Bloomberg and as well as an incentive by Governor George Pataki to obtain Newman and Fulani&#x27;s support for his re-election campaign.

In 2003, the Institute for Minority Education of Columbia University&#x27;s Teachers College undertook an evaluation of All Stars programs, which was coordinated and funded by All Stars Project staff and supporters. The 124-page report was based on extensive on-site observation of two of the All Stars programs, which were described as &quot;an exemplary effort in a field that is bursting with creative activity&quot;. The authors noted that they had &quot;not had access to data referable to the impact of these interventions on the short or long term behavioral development of learner participants&quot;. The report made only one brief reference (on page 9) to controversies regarding All Stars staff and volunteers being &quot;involved in various political movements, most centrally Independent [sic] Party politics ... [w]hile sometimes used as a point of attack by unfriendly media, the political networking has given the All Stars Project access to some halls of power that would have otherwise been closed.&quot; The Columbia researchers noted on page 14 of their report praised the political character of the All Stars program: &quot;Although political activism is not an explicit part of the All Stars and the DSY curriculum, it is an outcome of the programs. Young people who are empowered to get what they want are also likely to fight for what they think is right ... [T]he participants and staff of the ASTSN/DSY (All Stars Talent Show Network/Development School for Youth) have developed policy approaches to working with youth that are practical, efficient, and successful. That they have also worked to develop some influence in the halls of power is a tremendous asset to the development of the programs—as well as to the political process, which needs all the direction it can get in developing and implementing policy.&quot;

In 2006, the New York City Industrial Development Agency performed a review of the All Stars pursuant to an All Stars application for a bond. Several Democratic Party officials expressed strong opposition. Critics of the IDA bond, including New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, charged that the All Stars were connected to &quot;leaders who have taken positions that are misogynistic and Anti-Semitic&quot;, and questioned whether Newman and Fulani still ran All Stars, despite their having stepped down from official positions.

Despite public criticisms, the IDA board voted 6 to 4 in favor of approving the bond. All those in favor were mayoral appointees or representatives of ex officio members who were mayoral appointees. All those opposed were representatives of the offices of the Borough Presidents of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens, as well as the office of then-New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr..

After the vote, IDA chairman Joshua J. Sirefman told reporters that, based on the IDA&#x27;s review of the All Stars Project, &quot;[w]e have determined that the organization is in good standing, we found no evidence of misconduct of any kind by the organization, and we established that the project would benefit New York City... We are aware that allegations of wrongdoing by individuals associated with the organization existed a number of years ago.&quot;

In subsequent news coverage, Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the Agency&#x27;s vote to approve the bonds, noting &quot;I don&#x27;t think I heard one argument made that there was something wrong with the All Stars Project and that&#x27;s what we look at.&quot;

== Cult allegations ==

=== Early &quot;therapy cult&quot; allegations ===
In 1977, an article by Dennis King in &quot;Heights and Valley News&quot; alleged Newman was the leader of a &quot;therapy cult&quot;. The &quot;Public Eye&quot; magazine also carried an article in late 1977 making the claim, but it was primarily directed at Lyndon LaRouche&#x27;s NCLC (with which Newman was no longer affiliated).

In 1977, Newman responded that &quot;it is of the greatest importance that the entire community of social scientists insist that there be open and critical discussion and dialogue towards the advancement and development of the human sciences; that as scientists and as professionals we do not quiver and shake under the socio-pathological and essentially anti-communist rampages of a Dennis King or others like him.&quot;

Cult allegations arose again a 1982 article in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;.

When political researcher Chip Berlet became editor of &quot;The Public Eye&quot; magazine in 1984, he announced that the magazine no longer held to that characterization:

As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP, the &quot;Public Eye&quot; no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman&#x27;s political network a cult. We do feel that at one point in its development it was fair to characterize the group as a cult, and we still have strong criticisms of the group&#x27;s organizing style and the relationship between Newman&#x27;s Therapy Institute and his political organizing.

In 1988, a special issue of &quot;Radical America&quot; carried a series of articles and essays alleging manipulation, political deceit, and cult-like practices within the NAP. While Berlet, who had contributed to the issue, noted that Fulani &quot;deserves tremendous credit for apparently gaining ballot status in a majority of states,&quot; the editors concluded that there were &quot;dangerous ... implications&quot; in failing to confront Newman and his groups: &quot;Painful and unpleasant as it is, the time has come to expose the NAP before it discredits the Left – especially among blacks, gays and those exploring progressive politics for the first time.&quot;

A former NAP campaign worker, Loren Redwood, gave a much more critical account of her experiences with the party in a 1989 letter to the editor of &quot;Coming Up!&quot;, a lesbian and gay newspaper published in San Francisco. In the letter, Redwood describes her falling in love with a NAP campaign worker and the difficulties she encountered after joining her lover on the road campaigning for Fulani:

NAP claims to be a multi-racial, black led, woman led, pro gay, political party, an organization which recognizes and fights against racism, sexism, classism and homophobia – but NAP is a lie. NAP is always using the slogan: &quot;the personal is political&quot; and emphasizing the importance of enacting one&#x27;s politics into daily life. But this vision and the way their politics are enacted within the organization and life of those working for them is very much in conflict. As a working class lesbian, I thought I had finally found a political movement which included me. What I found instead was an oppressive, disempowering, misogynistic machine. All my decisions were made for me by someone else. I was told where to go, and who to go with.

I worked seven days a week – 16 to 20 hours a day (I had two days off in 2.5 months). There was an incredible urgency which overrode any personal needs or considerations, an urgency that meant complete self-sacrifice. I realize now how sexist that is. As a woman, I have always been taught that self-sacrifice is good and that I must be willing to give up everything for the greater good for all. Traditionally, this has come in the form of a husband and children; NAP is simply a substitute. I felt totally powerless over my life, forced into a very submissive role where all control of my life belonged to someone else.

In 1989, Newman told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that his critics were &quot;being sectarian and refusing to recognize the extraordinary accomplishments&quot; of Fulani and the NAP leadership.

Interviewed in the &quot;Times&quot; in 1991, Newman described the criticisms as &quot;absurd&quot; and the product of jealousies on the left and claimed that most social therapy clients do not involve themselves in his political activities. In the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; in 1992, Fulani claimed &quot;the entire thing is a lie&quot; and cited what she described as Political Research Associates&#x27; ties to the Democratic Party.

=== Sympathetic therapeutic professionals ===
Some of the cult criticisms have been disputed by some of Newman&#x27;s therapist peers.

According to British psychologist Ian Parker, &quot;Even those [Newman and Holzman] who have been marked by the FBI as a &#x27;cult&#x27; may still be a source of useful radical theory and practice. Like a weed, a cult is something that is growing in the wrong place. We would want to ask &#x27;wrong&#x27; for who, and whether it might sometimes be right for us. We have no desire to line up with the psychological establishment to rule out of the debate those who offer something valuable to anti-racist, feminist or working-class practice.&quot;

=== 2003 interview with John Soderlund ===
Newman (along with Holzman) responded to the ongoing controversy in a 2003 interview with John Söderlund, the editor of &quot;New Therapist&quot;, in a special issue devoted to mind control. In her introduction to the responses, Holzman claimed that the editor&#x27;s questions &quot;have that &#x27;When did you stop beating your wife?&#x27; quality&quot;:

These kinds of attacks are ludicrous in the way that the charge of being a witch was in centuries past. A cult is a made-up thing for which (like the made-up witch) there is no falsifiability. An entire mythology can thus be created, complete with attributes and activities that cannot be proven or disproven. Indeed, that&#x27;s the virtue of such made-up things. They paint a picture that holds you captive.

Söderlund asked about the recent focus of the American Psychological Association on the &quot;potential dangers of mind control.&quot;

Newman replied that he did not quite know what was meant by the term and noted, &quot;The closest association I have to it is what happens between parents and their young children. When children are very young, parents create a very controlled environment where there&#x27;s a great level of dependency on the parents. Gradually, as children come to experience other kinds of institutions (day care, school, etc.) their lived environment becomes less controlled and their dependency lessens.&quot; He explained that he did not think that sort of &quot;totally controlled environment&quot; to be imposable on an adult relationship &quot;outside of the extraordinary circumstances of say, the Manchurian Candidate. I don&#x27;t see how mind control has any applicability to therapy—therapy of any kind—as it&#x27;s a relationship where the clients have control... They pay, they can not show up, etc.&quot; Newman acknowledged that he believed that authoritarian and coercive therapists were likely doing bad therapy, but he did not consider that to be mind control.

Söderlund asked Newman to respond to an anonymous former social therapist&#x27;s statement that the practice has &quot;the criteria of groups which are considered cults: an authoritarian, charismatic leader, black-and-white thinking, repression of individuality, constant drive for fundraising, control of information, lack of tolerance for opposition within the group, etc.&quot;

Newman claimed he did not know what a cult was or even if there was such a thing and that the use of the cult charge is &quot;hostile, mean-spirited, and destructive.&quot; He denied being &quot;authoritarian,&quot; acknowledged the perception that he was &quot;charismatic,&quot; and considered the claim of &quot;black-and-white thinking&quot; to be &quot;antithetical to everything we do&quot; and cited social therapy&#x27;s interactions &quot;with practitioners and theorists across a very wide spectrum of traditions and worldviews.&quot; Newman countered the charge by insisting, &quot;We don&#x27;t repress individuality; we critique it. There is a difference!&quot; Newman commented as well on charges that he &quot;held in contempt&quot; ethical guidelines of professional associations such as the APA: &quot;We don&#x27;t look to the APA, CPA or any other institution for ethical standards,&quot; he replied. &quot;We&#x27;re critical (not contemptuous) of them for being hypocritical and think that depending on them for an ethical standard is ethically unsound.&quot;

=== Newman, et al. vs the FBI ===
FBI documents obtained in 1992 by the Freedom of Information Act showed that during Fulani&#x27;s 1988 campaign for president, it had begun a file that classified her party as a &quot;political cult&quot; that &quot;should be considered armed and dangerous.&quot; As described by investigative reporter Kelvyn Anderson in the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; in 1992, &quot;The 101-page FBI file, freed by an FOIA request, also contains media coverage of Fulani&#x27;s 1988 campaign, memos between FBI field offices on the subject of the New Alliance Party, a letter from an army counterintelligence official about party, and a copy of &quot;Clouds Blur the Rainbow&quot;, a report issued in late 1987 by Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates (PRA). PRA, which studies fringe political groups and intelligence agency abuses, is a prominent critic of the NAP, and its research is frequently used to discredit NAP as a psycho-political cult with totalitarian overtones.&quot;

Newman, Fulani, and the New Alliance Party challenged the FBI in a 1993 lawsuit asserting the FBI &quot;political cult&quot; labeling had violated their constitutional rights. The plaintiffs asserted that the bureau was gathering information from private, third-party organizations to evade federal guidelines prohibiting investigations of political organizations in the absence of evidence of criminal activity. In their suit, Newman et al. argued:

Political intelligence reports like [the ADL&#x27;s 1990 report] &quot;The New Alliance Party&quot; and [PRA&#x27;s] &quot;Clouds Blur the Rainbow&quot;, could not constitutionally be funded by the FBI directly. Organizations like the ADL and PRA engage in political intelligence gathering and political attacks on plaintiffs which the defendants are barred from carrying out directly by the Guidelines. The FBI then distributes the results of those &quot;private&quot; studies to its agents, and gives credibility to the &quot;private&quot; findings by incorporating the reports into files that are then obtained through FOIA by journalists and others

In her ruling on the case, Federal Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled that the &quot;political cult&quot; charge &quot;could not be directly traced to the 1988 FBI investigation&quot; and that &quot;any stigmatization which NAP suffers could be traced to a myriad of statements and publications made by private individuals and organizations, many of which preceded the FBI investigation.

Berlet, while upholding the charge of cultism, was critical of the FBI by noting that its investigation was &quot;not a protection of civil liberties but a smear of a group.&quot;

=== 2004 Presidential election ===
The cult charges appeared again in the 2004 Presidential election, when Newman supported independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader.

&quot;The Nation&quot; magazine, a leading liberal weekly which had supported Nader in 2000, asked, citing Berlet&#x27;s report, &quot;what in the world is Ralph Nader doing in bed with the ultrasectarian cult-racket formerly known as the New Alliance Party?&quot;

In its introduction to an article later that year by political writer Christopher Hitchens, the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; noted, &quot;Democrats are furious that Ralph Nader, whose last presidential bid helped put George W. Bush in office, is running again. Equally dismaying, the author finds, is Nader&#x27;s backing from a crackpot group with ties to Pat Buchanan, Lyndon LaRouche, and Louis Farrakhan.&quot; Echoing Berlet (who had attacked Nader in 2000 for working with figures like conservative industrialist Roger Milliken), Hitchens charged that &quot;[t]he Newman-Fulani group is a fascistic zombie cult outfit.&quot;

Nader came under fire from the ADL that year for his own Middle East views.

=== Later evaluations ===
In 2007, social psychologist and cult survivor Alexandra Stein wrote a dissertation for the University of Minnesota about the Newman &quot;operation&quot;. Arguing that it was a cult, Stein stated that members were recruited by therapy sessions and then controlled with fear. Exhausted by overwork and constant crisis, members clung to the organization and its charismatic leader for safety. According to Stein, a member named Marina Ortiz fled only after the group instructed her to put her son in foster care.

In 2017, Stein summarized Newman&#x27;s &quot;operation&quot; as a &quot;totalist system&quot;:

Gradually, they abandoned outside jobs and worked for the group, often off the books. They shared apartments, attended meetings late into the night, and restricted relationships with outsiders. Instead, many were set up in casual sexual relationships with other followers in a practice called ‘friendosexuality’. They were also assigned a ‘friend’ whose role was to monitor and criticise to keep them in line. Those with money were soon parted from it. Some women in the group were told by Newman to have abortions, and few had children while involved.

<text>Internet fraud is a type of cybercrime fraud or deception which makes use of the Internet and could involve hiding of information or providing incorrect information for the purpose of tricking victims out of money, property, and inheritance. Internet fraud is not considered a single, distinctive crime but covers a range of illegal and illicit actions that are committed in cyberspace. It is differentiated from theft since, in this case, the victim voluntarily and knowingly provides the information, money or property to the perpetrator. It is also distinguished by the way it involves temporally and spatially separated offenders. The most common cybercrimes involving the internet fraud increasingly entail the social engineering, phishing, cryptocurrency frauds, romance scams including the pig butchering scam, etc

In the FBI&#x27;s 2017 Internet Crime Report, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received about 300,000 complaints. Victims lost over $1.4 billion in online fraud in 2017. In a 2018 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and McAfee, cybercrime costs the global economy as much as $600 billion, which translates into 0.8% of global GDP. Online fraud appears in many forms. It ranges from email spam to online scams. Internet fraud can occur even if partly based on the use of Internet services and is mostly or completely based on the use of the Internet.

==Charity fraud==

The scammer poses as a charitable organization soliciting donations to help the victims of a natural disaster, terrorist attack (such as the 9/11 attacks), regional conflict, or epidemic. Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 tsunami were popular targets of scammers perpetrating charity scams; other more timeless scam charities purport to be raising money for cancer, AIDS or Ebola virus research, children&#x27;s orphanages (the scammer pretends to work for the orphanage or a non-profit associated with it), or impersonates charities such as the Red Cross or United Way. In recent years, there have been cases of scams being done by the people who started the charity.

A 2019 example of this was the head of the Long Island Charity, Wafa Abbound. Abbound was found guilty of stealing close to a million dollars. She was charged with bank fraud, money laundering, and embezzling. There are many methods scammers will use. First, they will ask for donations, often linking to online news articles to strengthen their story of a funds drive. The scammer&#x27;s victims are charitable people who believe they are helping a worthy cause and expect nothing in return. Once sent, the money is gone and the scammer often disappears, though many attempts to keep the scam going by asking for a series of payments. The victim may sometimes find themselves in legal trouble after deducting their supposed donations from their income taxes. United States tax law states that charitable donations are only deductible if made to a qualified non-profit organization.

The scammer may tell the victim their donation is deductible and provide all necessary proof of donation, but the information provided by the scammer is fictional, and if audited, the victim faces stiff penalties as a result of the fraud. Though these scams have some of the highest success rates especially following a major disaster and are employed by scammers all over the world, the average loss per victim is less than other fraud schemes. This is because, unlike scams involving a largely expected payoff, the victim is far less likely to borrow money to donate or donate more than they can spare.

==Internet ticket fraud==

A variation of Internet marketing fraud offers tickets to sought-after events such as concerts, shows, and sports events. The tickets are fake or are never delivered. The proliferation of online ticket agencies and the existence of experienced and dishonest ticket resellers has fueled this kind of fraud. Many such scams are run by British ticket touts, though they may base their operations in other countries.

A prime example was the global 2008 Beijing Olympic Games ticket fraud run by US-registered &quot;Xclusive Leisure and Hospitality&quot;, sold through a professionally designed website with the name &quot;Beijing 2008 Ticketing&quot;. On 4 August it was reported that more than A$50 million worth of fake tickets had been sold through the website. On 6 August it was reported that the person behind the scam, which was wholly based outside China, was a British ticket tout, Terance Shepherd.

==Online gift card fraud==

As retailers and other businesses have growing concerns about what they can do about preventing the use of gift cards purchased with stolen credit card numbers, cybercriminals have more recently been focusing on taking advantage of fraudulent gift cards. More specifically, malicious hackers have been trying to get their hands on information pertinent to gift cards that have been issued but not spent. Some of the methods for stealing gift card data include automated bots that launch brute force attacks on retailer systems which store them.

First, hackers will steal gift card data, check the existing balance through a retailer&#x27;s online service, and then attempt to use those funds to purchase goods or to resell on a third party website. In cases where gift cards are resold, the attackers will take the remaining balance in cash, which can also be used as a method of money laundering. This harms the customer gift card experience, the retailer&#x27;s brand perception, and can cost the retailer thousands in revenue. Another way gift card fraud is committed is by stealing a person&#x27;s credit card information to purchase brand new gift cards.

== Social media and fraud ==
People tend to disclose more personal information about themselves (e.g. birthday, e-mail, address, hometown and relationship status) in their social networking profiles. This personally identifiable information could be used by fraudsters to steal users&#x27; identities, and posting this information on social media makes it a lot easier for fraudsters to take control of it.

The problem of authenticity in online reviews is a long-standing and stubborn one. In one famous incident back in 2004, Amazon&#x27;s Canadian site accidentally revealed the true identities of thousands of its previously anonymous U.S. book reviewers. One insight the mistake revealed was that many authors were using fake names in order to give their own books favorable reviews. Also, 72% say positive reviews lead them to trust a business more, while 88% say that in &quot;the right circumstances&quot;, they trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.

While scammers are increasingly taking advantage of the power of social media to conduct criminal activity, astute risk managers and their insurance companies are also finding ways to leverage social media information as a tool to combat insurance fraud. For example, an injured worker was out of work on a worker&#x27;s compensation claim but could not resist playing a contact sport on a local semi-professional sports team. Through social media and internet searches, investigators discovered that the worker was listed on the team roster and was playing very well.

A UK woman was scammed in a &quot;romance fraud&quot; online as per the local police. The woman in her 50s reportedly lost her inheritance worth £320,000 taken over from her parents who later disowned her following the loss. The perpetrator who impersonated as Tim, met the victim on a dating website in 2019 after she lost her husband. He first took £68,000 in the name of customs fees and then asked her to directly pay £200,000 to his translator to secure his contractors and store his equipment, totalling the money lost to £320,000.

==Counterfeit postal money orders==

According to the FBI, on April 26, 2005 Tom Zeller Jr. wrote an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; regarding a surge in the quantity and quality of the forging of U.S. postal money orders, and its use to commit online fraud. Counterfeiters will conduct these scams through emails or chat rooms. If a person is trying to sell or give away an item of theirs, counterfeiters will make them believe that they are related to auction sites such as eBay. As of right now, there is no way to figure out how much money is being taken through these fake orders, the United States Postal Service believes that it is in the millions. The people who are targeted the most are those who are smaller retailers who operate through the internet or everyday people who sell or pay for items on the web. Owing to the lack of rules or warning signs about counterfeiters, more and more people will be affected.

Many companies like UPS and Federal Express have started to collaborate with the United States Postal Service to begin surveilling money postal orders. This way they can spot the real from the fake, however this is easier said then done, so they advocate users to be cautious when making a money postal orders. Arrests have taken place, between 2004 and 2005, 160 counterfeiters were arrested. Many of these arrested were caught in the process of cashing in the money they have stolen. In the United States of America, the penalty for making or using counterfeit postal money orders is up to ten years in jail and/or a $25,000 fine.

== Call Forwarding Fraud ==
Call Forwarding Scam involves a fraudster tricking the victim into dialing a specific phone number, which then reroutes all incoming calls and text messages victim receives to the scammer&#x27;s device. Scammers in-turn intercepts bank messages and OTPs, while the victim remains unaware.

==Purchase fraud==
A fraudster uses the internet to advertise non-existent goods or services. Payment is sent remotely but the goods or services never arrive. The methods these scammers use are they will give these fake products very low prices, they will want to make payments through electronic funds transfers, and they will want to do it right away. Payments will not be conducted through PayPal or credit cards. These services are too secure and will cause issues for the scammers. All of these methods are also ways to figure out on whether or not these are actually scams. Another way to spot the scam is privacy and contact details, information about delivery, terms and conditions, etc, will not be presented.

Scammers will operate from fake stores. They will broadcast the presence of these fake stores through social media. This is done primarily because there are a lot of people who use social media and the number keeps growing every day. These stores will not be up for a long period. The will only stay up for a couple of sales, then they will move on and close the site. Usually, a way to spot these fake stores is to look for online reviews, if they do not have any reviews, they are fake.

<text>The Ohio Express is an American bubblegum pop band formed in Mansfield, Ohio, in 1967. Though marketed as a band, it would be more accurate to say that the name &quot;Ohio Express&quot; served as a brand name used by Jerry Kasenetz&#x27;s and Jeffry Katz&#x27;s Super K Productions to release the music of a number of different musicians and acts. The best known songs of Ohio Express (including their best-scoring single, &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot;) were actually the work of an assemblage of studio musicians working in New York, including singer/songwriter Joey Levine. Other recorded &quot;Ohio Express&quot; work included material recorded by an early group of Joe Walsh, as well as a later single written and sung by Graham Gouldman (which was performed by the four musicians who would later be known as 10cc).

A band previously known as Sir Timothy and the Royals was renamed &quot;The Ohio Express&quot; and hired to promote the singles by appearing at all live performances. This is the same group photographed on the record covers.

==Career==
===Beginnings: The Rare Breed (1966–1967)===
The question of who is the &quot;real&quot; Ohio Express is difficult to answer. The first record credited to The Ohio Express was &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot;, a &quot;Louie Louie&quot; derivation which became a top 40 hit in the US and Canada in late 1967. However, exactly the same record had been issued by the Rare Breed in early 1966 on Attack Records. This failed nationally, though it did see regional chart action in New Hampshire and Utah.

The Rare Breed issued one more single in 1966 on Attack, &quot;Come and Take a Ride in My Boat&quot;, which was a minor chart hit in the US southwest though also failed to chart nationally (the song hit No. 6 a year later for Every Mother&#x27;s Son as &quot;Come On Down to My Boat&quot;). The Rare Breed then apparently had a dispute with Super K Productions and left the company, never to record again.

The band&#x27;s recording of &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Steal&quot; was then re-mixed and re-issued in August 1967 on Cameo Parkway Records, now credited to the Ohio Express (a name to which Super K Productions controlled all rights). The record was a No. 1 single in Columbus, Ohio, by early September and gradually became a hit across Canada and the US through the following months.

The otherwise exhaustively annotated &quot;Nuggets&quot; box set (which includes &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot;) suggests the Rare Breed were from New York or New Jersey, but offers no other data. However, a 2003 interview and a 2009 YouTube post of a performance of &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot; identifies the members of the Rare Breed as John Freno (vocals, guitar), Barry Stolnick (keyboards), Joel Feigenbaum (rhythm guitar), Alexander &quot;Bots&quot; Narbut (vocals, bass) and Tony Cambria (drums), all originally from Brooklyn and the Bronx, New York.

===Sir Timothy and the Royals take over (1967)===
With no group available to promote the single by playing live dates, Super K Productions hired a Mansfield, Ohio band known as Sir Timothy &amp; the Royals and renamed them the Ohio Express. The lineup consisted of Dale Powers (born June 22, 1948; vocals, lead guitar), Doug Grassel (born Douglas Martin Grassel in Mansfield, Ohio; July 5, 1949 – September 21, 2013; rhythm guitar), Dean Kastran (born October 22, 1948; bass), Jim Pfahler (born James William Pfahler in Mansfield, Ohio; August 12, 1948 – March 10, 2003; keyboards) and Tim Corwin (born July 26, 1948; drums). This group toured as the Ohio Express, and their touring commitments (and Ohio home base) made it difficult for them to head into the New York-based Super K offices to record a follow-up single to &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot;. Of the &quot;official&quot; group members, only Dale Powers (lead vocals) appeared on the second single credited to Ohio Express, &quot;Try It&quot;, later covered by the Standells. The single stalled well outside the US Top 40, peaking at No. 83.

The group soon recorded an album called &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot;. It mixed the original Rare Breed title track with tracks recorded by the Ohio Express touring group, as well as tracks recorded by the Super K staff musicians with vocals by Powers. The LP came out on Cameo-Parkway Records of Philadelphia in the autumn of 1967. Unfortunately, the record label went into bankruptcy shortly after that and was purchased by music business mogul Allen Klein, who owns the masters to this day.

Two songs on the &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot; LP, &quot;I Find I Think of You&quot; and &quot;And It&#x27;s True&quot;, were actually recorded by the Kent, Ohio, band the Measles, led by Joe Walsh, later of the James Gang and the Eagles. In addition, the Measles recorded an instrumental version of &quot;And It&#x27;s True&quot; (retitled &quot;Maybe&quot;) which was placed on the B-side of the &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot; single.

=== The Joey Levine years (1968–1969) ===

The Ohio Express then moved to the home label of bubblegum pop, Buddah Records. At the same time, Joey Levine (who had co-written &quot;Try It&quot;) was coming up with new material for the Ohio Express at the behest of Super K Productions. He recorded a demo version of the track &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot; with Super K staff musicians and his own guide vocal for the Ohio Express to record over. However, Buddah head Neil Bogart liked the demo enough that he released the record &quot;as is&quot;, with Levine&#x27;s vocals intact and no input at all from the touring version of the Ohio Express. The song became an international smash hit, peaking at #4 US, #5 UK, #5 Ireland, #7 Australia and #1 Canada. Two months after its issue it had sold over one million copies, and was granted gold disc status by the R.I.A.A. in June 1968.

The success of the Levine-led &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot; set a pattern for the Ohio Express. They released four LPs and a multitude of singles for Buddah between 1968 and 1970, but the &quot;official&quot; group that appeared on album sleeves and at live shows contributed not a single note to their hit singles. For the year following the release of &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot;, all Ohio Express singles were co-written and sung by Levine, with musical accompaniment by anonymous New York session musicians. Under this arrangement, in 1968 and 1969 the group scored three further top 40 hits in the US, Canada and Australia with &quot;Down at Lulu&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Chewy Chewy&quot; and &quot;Mercy&quot;. &quot;Chewy Chewy&quot; was the group&#x27;s second million seller by March 1969. Also around this time, the group name lost the definite article, becoming &quot;Ohio Express&quot; for most releases from this point forward.

There are no known occasions of Levine performing with the &quot;official&quot; Ohio Express quintet, either live or in the studio. The five lads from Ohio, meanwhile, could only be heard on a few of the album tracks. Allegedly, the touring group was not even informed of the existence of &quot;Chewy Chewy&quot;, the new single that had come out under their name — and when fans requested it at a live show, they were consequently unable to play it.

===&quot;Recycled&quot; tracks (1968–1970)===
Super K Productions often recycled tracks from one act to another, issuing exactly the same recording under two different band names. In addition to the Ohio Express hit &quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot; (initially credited to the Rare Breed), fans have noted that various Ohio Express B-sides and album tracks were in fact initially issued and credited to other Super K acts. Examples include the B-side of the &quot;Sausalito&quot; single, &quot;Make Love Not War&quot;, which was originally issued as &quot;Road Runner&quot; by the Music Explosion and the 1970 album track &quot;Shake&quot;, originally issued by Kasenetz Katz Super Circus. As well, &quot;Zig Zag,&quot; the B-side to &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot;, was the instrumental track of 1910 Fruitgum Company&#x27;s &quot;(Poor Old) Mr. Jensen&quot; cut to play backwards.

===The Post-Levine era (1969–1970)===
After five straight singles co-written and sung by Joey Levine (four of which made the US and Canadian Top 40), Levine grew dissatisfied with the amount of money he was receiving from his production deal, and left Super K Productions in early 1969. The company then turned to other hands to write, produce and perform Ohio Express singles. The Ohio touring quintet was not among them.

Buddy Bengert (1949 – February 14, 1998) was added as the new lead singer and keyboardist in 1969.

After Levine left, The Ohio Express never again made the top 40 in North America, although three 1969 singles made the lower reaches of the US and Canadian singles charts. One later minor hit single, &quot;Sausalito (is the Place to Go)&quot; was co-written and sung by Graham Gouldman, and performed by the four musicians who would later make up 10cc. Another late single, &quot;Cowboy Convention&quot;, sneaked into the Australian top 40, peaking at No. 38.

By 1970, with the hits having stopped, the group name Ohio Express was then quietly retired in 1972 (there was a one-shot 1973 Buddah release credited to Ohio Ltd.).

In 1975, Kasanetz and Katz briefly put together a new live band using the name the Ohio Express. The band performed at clubs on Long Island for a short while, and featured John Visconti on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Irv Berner on lead guitar and vocals, Elliot Schwartz on keys and vocals and Angie on bass guitar. Len Napolitano filled in on drums for several performances. In 2017 Irv Berner would go on to help open and manage the Songbirds Guitar Museum in Chattanooga. The guitar museum would close its doors in 2020 due to the Covid Pandemic. Irv would then go on to produce an Emmy Award winning documentary of the museum called &quot;Songbirds&quot; with Director Dagan Beckett and producer David Davidson in 2022.

Years later Tim Corwin revised another version of the band and began performing nationally and overseas. Corwin kept the band active, and filed for a service mark for the name Ohio Express, in 1999 without the consent of the record labels that own the rights to the name with the various master recordings. The Ohio Express recently has performed in Las Vegas, other casinos and most recently (2012) Corwin made an appearance on Cologne Television, performing &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Mansfield guitarist Mike Brumm, joined and remained in the group until the late 2000s.

===The Ohio Express today===
A new touring version of The Ohio Express was convened in the 1980s. Today, a line-up led by original drummer Tim Corwin on lead vocals, John Baker (Lead guitar), Stan Rust (Bass), Bill Hutchman (Drums), Jeff Burgess (Keyboard) and Warren Sawyer (Rhythm guitar and Keyboards) tours the oldies circuit.

On July 23, 1988, the original touring quintet of Powers, Kastran, Grassel, Pfahler and Corwin reunited for a &quot;20 Year Reunion Concert&quot; at the Renaissance Theater in their Mansfield hometown.

Two of the original touring group members have died: keyboardist/vocalist/songwriter Jim Pfahler died on March 10, 2003, at age 54, and rhythm guitarist Doug Grassel died of lung fibrosis on September 21, 2013, at age 64.

Bassist Dean Kastran became a member of national act called The Cyrkle beginning in June 2021. He also plays bass and sings in the Eggerton-Kastran Group (a.k.a., EKG), an acoustic duo with vocalist/guitarist Denny Eggerton, and the five-piece band the Caffiends, both based in Mansfield, Ohio. Dale Powers is now a Christian music evangelist based in Mansfield, Ohio, and founded his own record label as well as website for his ministry. Dean Kastran plays bass in the Race Ministries Band and recorded tracks with Dale on his album of original songs titled &quot;The Journey Within!&quot;.

<text>Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History is a 1989 book on the evolution of Cambrian fauna by Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. The volume made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, was the 1991 winner of the Royal Society&#x27;s Rhone-Poulenc Prize, the American Historical Association&#x27;s Forkosch Award, and was a 1991 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Pulitzer juror Joyce Carol Oates later revealed the non-fiction jury had unanimously recommended the book for the prize, but the selection was rejected by the Pulitzer board. Gould described his later book &quot;Full House&quot; (1996) as a companion volume to &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;.

== Summary ==
Gould&#x27;s thesis in &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; was that contingency plays a major role in the evolutionary history of life. He based his argument on the extraordinarily well preserved fossils of the Burgess Shale, a rich fossil-bearing deposit in Canada&#x27;s Rocky Mountains, dating 505 million years ago. Gould argues that during this period just after the Cambrian explosion there was a greater disparity of anatomical body plans (phyla) than exist today. However most of these phyla left no modern descendants. All of the Burgess animals, Gould argues, were exquisitely adapted to their environment, and there exists little evidence that the survivors were any better adapted than their extinct contemporaries.

Gould proposed that given a chance to &quot;rewind the tape of life&quot; and let it play again, we might find ourselves living in a world populated by descendants of &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; rather than &quot;Pikaia&quot; (the ancestor of all vertebrates, or at least a close relative thereof). Gould stressed that his argument was not based on &quot;randomness&quot; but rather &quot;contingency&quot;, a process by which historical outcomes arise from an unpredictable sequence of antecedent states, where any change in the sequence alters the final result. Because fitness for existing conditions does not guarantee long-term survivalparticularly when conditions change catastrophicallythe survival of many species depends more on luck than conventional features of anatomical superiority. Gould maintains that, &quot;traits that
enhance survival during an extinction do so in ways that are incidental and unrelated to the causes of their evolution in the first place.&quot; Gould earlier coined the term exaptation to describe fortuitously beneficial traits, which are adaptive but arise for reasons other than incremental natural selection.

Gould regarded &quot;Opabinia&quot;an odd creature with five eyes and frontal nozzleas so important to understanding the Cambrian explosion that he wanted to call his book &quot;Homage to Opabinia&quot;. Gould wrote: 

==Reception==

&quot;Wonderful Life&quot; quickly climbed the national bestseller lists within weeks of publication. It stimulated wide discussion regarding the nature of progress and contingency in evolution.

Gould&#x27;s thesis was that if the history of life were replayed over again, human-level intelligence would prove unlikely to ever arise again. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr argued that Gould, &quot;made such contingencies a major theme in &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, and I have come to the conclusion that here he may be largely right.&quot; In his review, the biologist Richard Dawkins wrote that, &quot;The view that he is attackingthat evolution marches inexorably towards a pinnacle such as manhas not been believed for 50 years.&quot;

Biologist John Maynard Smith wrote, &quot;I agree with Gould that evolution is not in general predictable. ... Although I agree with Gould about contingency, I find the problem of progress harder. ... I do think that progress has happened, although I find it hard to define precisely what I mean.&quot; Philosopher Michael Ruse wrote that, &quot;&quot;Wonderful Life&quot; was the best book written by the late Stephen Jay Gould, paleontologist and popular science writer. It is ... a thrilling story that Gould tells in a way that no one else could equal.&quot;

Some of the anatomical reconstructions cited by Gould were soon challenged as being incorrect, most notably Simon Conway Morris&#x27; 1977 reconstruction of &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;. Conway Morris&#x27; reconstruction was, &quot;so peculiar, so hard to imagine as an efficiently working beast&quot; Gould speculated that &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; might be &quot;a complex appendage of a larger creature, still undiscovered.&quot; It was later brought to light by paleontologists Lars Ramskold and Hou Xianguang that Conway Morris&#x27; reconstruction was inverted upside down, and likely belonged to the modern phylum Onychophora.

The ultimate theme of the book is still being debated among evolutionary biologists today.

<text>Wonderful Life (U.S.: Swingers&#x27; Paradise) is a 1964 British film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Cliff Richard, Walter Slezak, Susan Hampshire and The Shadows. It is the third in a series of film musicals starring Richard following &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1961) and &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963). It was written by Peter Myers and Ronald Cass, and choreographed by Gillian Lynne.

==Plot==
Jonnie and his bandmates work as waiters on a travelling ferry. Through a pyrotechnics accident, the power on the ferry cuts off and the group are fired on the spot, stranded on a tiny boat with nothing but their instruments. They float around in the Atlantic Ocean until they reach the Canary Islands.

The group ends up in a sand dune, miserable and confused, wondering what to do next. They are briefly confused by a mirage of a ferry but then decide to set off again in the direction they were originally heading. Jonnie spots a figure on an out-of-control camel and rushes to save her, but discovers that he had accidentally ruined a scene being filmed for a movie. Despite the disruption, director Lloyd Davis offers him a job as a stunt double and gives the rest of Jonnie&#x27;s group jobs as runners.

Later that evening, Jonnie spots a blonde woman sitting at his opposite table reading from a script. Her name is Jenny and she doesn&#x27;t believe that she is a good enough actress to be the leading lady. Jonnie tells her to ignore the cameras and the crew watching her, and imagine that she isn&#x27;t acting. The advice does not help her and Lloyd regrets hiring her.

Jonnie&#x27;s band realise they could cheer everyone up by making the movie a musical, disguising their spare camera behind various objects. The group race through the filming under Lloyd and Jenny&#x27;s noses, filming a musical number by telling Jenny to sing her script along with the music secretly played by Jonnie&#x27;s band hiding behind a wall. They are caught by an eavesdropping Lloyd who threatens to fire them, but Jonnie convinces him not to. Lloyd smugly tells him that he will allow them to continue but not with any of his equipment. Jonnie and his friends decide to film when the actual team is not around to witness, and borrow a camera, but worry about filming the finale without Jenny&#x27;s knowledge. In a restaurant, they discuss their plans and make jokes at Lloyd&#x27;s expense, unaware that Lloyd and Jenny are on an adjacent table. Lloyd, who is revealed as Jenny&#x27;s father, vows to stop them and orders Jenny not to go on set the next day.

Jonnie finds Jenny at the nearest swimming pool and begs her to help them. She agrees, snapping that she never wants to see him again. When filming is over, Lloyd is disappointed that his final cut for the film isn&#x27;t up to his standard and Jonnie isn&#x27;t happy about the musical adaptation either. They decide to join forces and combine their movies, rewriting the tale as a story about two brothers and a princess. It is shown at the movie premiere and the audience&#x27;s reception is positive. Lloyd expresses his gratitude to Jonnie during the applause and tells him that Jenny wants to marry him.

== Film soundtrack ==
A soundtrack album was released in 1964 credited to Cliff Richard with The Shadows.

==Production==
The film was shot, in Techniscope, in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria city in Spain, and the &quot;desert&quot; scenes shot on Maspalomas sand dunes on Gran Canaria island, Canary Islands.

==Reception==

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Saddled with a more than usually imbecilic story, Sidney Furie has still managed to make a likeably bouncy, if not very good film. ... The humour ... is depressingly unfunny; and the musical numbers, with choreography patterned some way after &quot;West Side Story&quot;, are robbed of most of their effect by the fact that they are danced by non-dancing principals, while the real dancers are kept as a background chorus. On the credit side, however, are a genial performance by Walter Slezak, the likeable Cliff Richard, a lively twist number on the beach involving the entire film unit, and especially a lengthy &#x27;potted history of the movies&#x27; ... Like &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;, in fact, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; has more good intentions than accomplishments, but it is kept going by Sidney Furie&#x27;s amiable, unpretentious drive&quot;

=== Box office ===
According to &quot;Kine Weekly&quot;, it was among the ten most popular films of the year at the British box office in 1964. However it was considered a box office disappointment after the first two Richards musicals. Richards claims it took seven years for the movie to go into profit.

<doc id="805646" wikidata="Q1143974" url="?curid=805646" title="Matsumae Castle">
<text>is a castle located in Matsumae in Hokkaidō, Japan, and is the northernmost castle in Japan. The only traditional style Edo period castle in Hokkaidō, it was the chief residence of the &quot;han&quot; (estate) of the Matsumae clan.

==History==
First built in 1606 by &quot;daimyo&quot; Matsumae Yoshihiro under orders from the Tokugawa shogunate, which required his clan to defend the area, and by extension the whole of Japan, from the Ainu &quot;barbarians&quot; to the north. It burned down in 1637 but was rebuilt in 1639. It once controlled all passage through Hokkaidō to the rest of Japan.

The present castle complex, which dates from 1854, was constructed to deter attacks by foreign naval forces. Only the 30-metre-high &quot;tenshu&quot; (main tower) and a gatehouse survived destruction following the Meiji Restoration, which began in 1868. However, the &quot;tenshu&quot; burned down in 1949 and a concrete replica was built in 1960.

Today, all of the castle site is now a public park.

== Festivals ==
Approximately 8,000 cherry trees are planted in Matsumae Park, which is approximately 150,000 m2 around the site of Matsumae Castle. More than 200,000 people visit the Matsumae Sakura Festival every spring to see cherry blossoms.

Since 1984, the &quot;Matsumae Castle Age Festival&quot; has been held in August.

<text>John Charles Fields, FRS, FRSC (May 14, 1863 – August 9, 1932) was a Canadian mathematician and the founder of the Fields Medal for outstanding achievement in mathematics.

==Career==
Born in Hamilton, Canada West, to a leather shop owner, Fields graduated from Hamilton Collegiate Institute in 1880 and the University of Toronto in 1884 before leaving for the United States to study at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Fields received his Ph.D. in 1887. His thesis, entitled &quot;Symbolic Finite Solutions and Solutions by Definite Integrals of the Equation dny/dxn = xmy&quot;, was published in the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot; in 1886.

Fields taught for two years at Johns Hopkins before joining the faculty of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. Disillusioned with the state of mathematical research in North America at the time, he left for Europe in 1891, locating primarily in Berlin, Göttingen and Paris, where he associated with some of the greatest mathematical minds of the time, including Karl Weierstrass, Felix Klein, Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and Max Planck. Fields also began a lifelong friendship with Gösta Mittag-Leffler. He began publishing papers on a new topic, algebraic functions, which would prove to be the most fruitful research field of his career.

Fields returned to Canada in 1902 to lecture at the University of Toronto. Back in the country of his birth, he worked tirelessly to raise the status of mathematics within academic and public circles. He successfully lobbied the Ontario Legislature for an annual research grant of $75,000 for the university and helped establish the National Research Council of Canada, and the Ontario Research Foundation. Fields served as president of the Royal Canadian Institute from 1919 until 1925, during which time he aspired to mold the institute into a leading centre of scientific research, although with mixed success. His efforts, however, were pivotal in making Toronto the location of the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM). He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge, in 1924 at Toronto, and in 1928 at Bologna.

Fields is best known for his development of the Fields Medal, which is considered by some to be the Nobel Prize of mathematics, although there are differences between the awards. First awarded in 1936, the medal was reintroduced in 1950 and has been awarded every four years since. It is awarded to two, three or four mathematicians under the age of 40 who have made important contributions to the field.

Fields began planning the award in the late 1920s but, due to deteriorating health, never saw the implementation of the medal in his lifetime. He died on August 9, 1932, after a three-month illness; in his will, he left $47,000 for the Fields Medal fund. His plan for the Fields medal was completed by J. L. Synge.

==Honours==
Fields was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1907 and of the Royal Society of London in 1913.

The Fields Institute at the University of Toronto was named in his honour.

<text>Don Coscarelli Jr. (born February 17, 1954) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is best known for his work in horror films. His directing credits include the first four films in the &quot;Phantasm&quot; franchise, as well as &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; (1982) and &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; (2002).

== Biography ==
Coscarelli was born to Italian settlers in Libya and raised in Southern California. Although his family was not connected with the motion picture business, he was fascinated with cameras and filmmaking at an early age. Long before he was old enough to attend film school, his short films, made with the help of neighborhood friends in his hometown of Los Alamitos, California , were winning prizes on television.

At the age of 19, Coscarelli became the youngest director to have a feature film distributed by a major studio when he sold his independently produced drama &quot;Jim the World&#x27;s Greatest&quot;, to Universal Pictures. The film was the first collaboration for Coscarelli with actor Lawrence Rory Guy, who went on to achieve horror icon status under the screen name Angus Scrimm. &quot;Jim the World&#x27;s Greatest&quot; was an official selection of the USA Film Festival.

Coscarelli is best known for &quot;Phantasm&quot;, and its sequels. The original &quot;Phantasm&quot; was a worldwide critical and box-office success and won the Special Jury Prize at the Festival du Cinema Fantastique at Avoriaz, France.

Coscarelli also co-wrote (with Paul Pepperman) and directed &quot;The Beastmaster&quot;, which was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as &quot;a surefire audience favorite.&quot; &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; has spawned two sequels and a television series.

Coscarelli was the recipient of the Bram Stoker Award for Best Screenplay for his film &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot;, which he also directed. Based on a short story by Joe R. Lansdale, &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; stars Bruce Campbell, Ossie Davis, and frequent Coscarelli collaborator Reggie Bannister. In addition to being a critical hit, &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; was also a festival favorite, playing prestigious international film festivals like the Toronto International Film Festival, SXSW, Florida Film Festival, Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films, and the Hong Kong International Film festival. At HBO&#x27;s US Comedy Arts Festival, Coscarelli was the recipient of the Best Screenplay Award. At Montreal&#x27;s FantAsia Festival, &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; was the recipient of the Best International Film award.

Coscarelli also directed the premiere episode of the American TV series &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;, titled &quot;Incident On and Off a Mountain Road&quot; and co-wrote the teleplay with Stephen Romano. In 2008, Coscarelli purchased film rights to the horror novel and internet series &quot;John Dies at the End&quot; by David Wong. The film was completed in 2011, and released in 2013.

In 2018, he published his memoir, &quot;True Indie: Life and Death in Filmmaking&quot;.

Coscarelli frequently collaborates with his wife, costume designer Shelley Kay. His daughter is award-winning vegan chef Chloe Coscarelli.

<text>Joaquin Alberto Vargas y Chávez (9 February 1896 – 30 December 1982) was a Peruvian-American painter of pin-up girls. He is often considered one of the most famous of the pin-up artists, and as one of the pioneers of airbrush art. Numerous Vargas paintings have sold and continue to sell for tens of thousands around the world.

==Life and career==
Born in Arequipa, Peru, he was the son of noted Peruvian photographer Max T. Vargas. Alberto Vargas moved to the United States in 1916 after studying art in Europe, particularly in Zurich and Geneva, prior to World War I. While he was in Europe he came upon the French magazine &quot;La Vie Parisienne,&quot; with a cover by Raphael Kirchner, which he said was a great influence on his work.

His early career in New York included work as an artist for the Ziegfeld Follies and for many Hollywood studios. Ziegfeld hung his painting of Olive Thomas at the theater, and she was thought of as one of the earliest Vargas Girls. Vargas&#x27; most famous piece of film work was the poster of the 1933 film &quot;The Sin of Nora Moran&quot;, which portrays a near-naked Zita Johann in a pose of desperation, bearing little resemblance to the real actress. The poster is frequently named one of the greatest movie posters ever made.

Vargas became famous in the 1940s as the creator of iconic World War-II era pin-ups for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine known as &quot;Vargas Girls.&quot; Between 1940 and 1946 Vargas produced 180 paintings for the magazine. The nose art of many American and Allied World War II aircraft was inspired and adapted from these &quot;Esquire&quot; pin-ups, as well as those of George Petty, and other artists.

In 2004, Hugh Hefner, the founder and Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Playboy&quot;, who had previously worked for &quot;Esquire&quot;, wrote: &quot;The US Post Office attempted to put &quot;Esquire&quot; out of business in the 1940s by taking away its second-class mailing permit. The Feds objected, most especially, to the cartoons and the pin-up art of Alberto Vargas. &quot;Esquire&quot; prevailed in the case that went to the Supreme Court, but the magazine dropped the cartoons just to be on the safe side&quot;. A legal dispute with &quot;Esquire&quot; over the use of the name &quot;Varga&quot; resulted in a judgement against Vargas. He struggled financially until 1959 when &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine began to use his work. Over the next 16 years he produced 152 paintings for the magazine. His career flourished and he had major exhibitions of his work all over the world.

Vargas&#x27; artistic work, paintings and color drawings, were periodically featured in issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in the 1960s and 1970s.
The death of his wife Anna Mae in 1974 left him devastated, and he stopped painting. Anna Mae had been his model and business manager, his muse in every way. The publication of his autobiography in 1978 renewed interest in his work and brought him partially out of his self-imposed retirement to do a few works, such as album covers for The Cars (&quot;Candy-O&quot;, 1979) and Bernadette Peters (&quot;Bernardette Peters&quot;, 1980; &quot;Now Playing&quot;, 1981). He died of a stroke on 30 December 1982, at the age of 86.

Many of Vargas&#x27; works from his period with &quot;Esquire&quot; are now held by the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas. It was given those works in 1980 along with a large body of other art from the magazine.

At the December 2003 Christie&#x27;s auction of &quot;Playboy&quot; archives, the 1967 Vargas painting &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; sold for $71,600 ().

His work was typically a combination of watercolor and airbrush. His mastery of the airbrush is acknowledged by the founding of the Vargas Award, awarded annually by &quot;Airbrush Action Magazine&quot;, which was named after him. Despite always using figure models, he often portrayed elegantly dressed, semi-nude to nude women of idealized proportions. Vargas&#x27; artistic trait would be slender fingers and toes, with nails often painted red.

Vargas is widely regarded as one of the finest artists in his genre. He also served as a judge for the Miss Universe beauty contest from 1956 to 1958.

Notable women painted by Vargas include Billie Burke, Ruth Etting, Paulette Goddard, Bessie Love, Irish McCalla, Marilyn Miller, Marilyn Monroe, Nita Naldi, Bernadette Peters, Olive Thomas, Mamie Van Doren, and Candy Moore from The Cars&#x27; &quot;Candy-O&quot; album.

<doc id="805655" wikidata="Q7372655" url="?curid=805655" title="Roy Cazaly">
<text>Roy Cazaly (13 January 1893 – 10 October 1963) was an Australian rules footballer who played for South Melbourne and St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He also represented Victoria and Tasmania in interstate football, and after his retirement as a player, turned to coaching. Known for his ruck work and high-flying marks, he inspired the common catchphrase &quot;Up there, Cazaly!&quot;, which in 1979 became a popular song of the same name, securing his place in Australian folklore.

Cazaly was one of 12 inaugural &quot;Legends&quot; inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

==Family==
Cazaly was born in Albert Park, a suburb of Melbourne, on 13 January 1893. He was the tenth child of English-born James Cazaly and his wife Elizabeth Jemima (née McNee). James Cazaly was a renowned sculler and rower in Melbourne. Just before 6 July 1878 he was eliminated in a semi-final for the sculling championship of Victoria by the eventual victor, Charles A. Messenger. Elizabeth was a midwife and herbalist from Scotland.

==Football==
Cazaly learnt his football at the local state school, quickly becoming its first-choice ruckman. He tried out for VFL side Carlton Football Club in 1910, but quit the club when he injured a shoulder in a reserves match and could not get the Carlton medical staff to treat it.

===St Kilda===
Cazaly crossed to fellow VFL side St Kilda and made his senior debut in 1911 during a players&#x27; strike, when many of St Kilda&#x27;s regular senior players refused to play as a result of a dispute with the club&#x27;s committee over dressing rooms.

One of nine new players in the team, Cazaly played his only First XVIII match for St Kilda against Carlton, at Princes park, on 29 July 1911.

The other new players were: Alby Bowtell, Claude Crowl, Peter Donnelly, Alf Hammond, Otto Opelt, Rowley Smith, Tom Soutar, and Bill Ward – and, including that match, and ignoring Harrie Hattam (16 games), Bert Pierce (41 games), and Bill Woodcock (65 games), the very inexperienced team&#x27;s remaining fifteen players had only played a total of 46 matches.

He played 99 matches with St Kilda.

===South Melbourne===
In 1920, he left St Kilda, signing with South Melbourne. He coached that club in 1922, and won South&#x27;s most consistent player award in 1926.

During the depression of the early 1930s, he worked on the Melbourne waterfront and played with waterside workers in a midweek football competition.

===VFL fame===
Cazaly was famous for his ability to take spectacular marks despite his small stature, and, at South Melbourne, teammates Fred &quot;Skeeter&quot; Fleiter and Mark &quot;Napper&quot; Tandy would simultaneously yell &quot;Up there, Cazzer&quot;, originating the phrase that would become synonymous with Australian rules football. He initially developed his marking ability by jumping at a ball strung up in a shed at his home, and held his breath as he jumped, an action that he believed lifted him higher. He also possessed the capacity to kick a football over 65 metres. In 2009, &quot;The Australian&quot; nominated Cazaly as one of the 25 greatest footballers never to win a Brownlow Medal.

===Post-VFL and coaching career===
In 1928, he played for the South Melbourne Districts Football Club, including in a losing VFL Sub-Districts grand final in 1928.

He departed Victoria at the end of the year and headed for Launceston, Tasmania, before returning in 1931 to coach Preston in the Victorian Football Association (VFA).

His subsequent return to Tasmania was punctuated by short stints as non-playing coach of South Melbourne (in 1937–1938), coach of Camberwell (in 1941, at age 48, he was nominally a non-playing coach, but he did don a guernsey for a few games late in the season), non-playing coach of Hawthorn (in 1942–1943), and as non-playing assistant coach of South Melbourne in 1947.

While coaching Hawthorn, he was reported to have given the club its nickname the &quot;Hawks&quot;, as he saw it as tougher than their original nickname the &quot;Mayblooms&quot;.

==Legacy==
He is known to have played 322 premiership matches (198 in the VFL and 124 in the Tasmanian leagues), and 354 total career senior games (including 14 intrastate matches for the NTFA in Tasmania, and 18 interstate matches, 13 for Victoria and five for Tasmania). If his matches for Preston and Camberwell in the VFA are included, then Cazaly played in 343 premiership matches and 375 total career senior games. Cazaly also played country football for Minyip in 1925, and in a mid-week football competition during the 1930s.

Throughout his career, he stood at just , which is short for a ruckman, although his high leap made up for this, and he was incredibly fit. He retired from competitive football in 1941 at the age of 48. Later, he coached (non-playing) New Town to a number of Tasmanian Football League premierships. 

The famous cry &quot;Up there, Cazaly&quot; was used as a battle cry by Australian forces during World War II.

It is also the name of a famous song, released in 1979 by Mike Brady and the Two-Man Band.

After his retirement from football, Cazaly was involved in many business ventures. In later years he was mainly busy running a successful physiotherapy business in Hobart, which, in the years before his death, has been managed by his son, also called Roy. Roy jr. played for New Town FC after World War II. Cazaly, known for his extraordinary fitness well into his later years, however, the last five years before his death at the age of seventy on 10 October 1963 in Lenah Valley in the suburbs of Hobart he had been in ill health.

Cazaly was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the inaugural twelve &quot;Legends&quot;. Cazalys Stadium in Cairns, Queensland, has been named since 2003 after Roy Cazaly.

<doc id="805665" wikidata="Q459485" url="?curid=805665" title="Nucleoid">
<text>The nucleoid (meaning &quot;nucleus-like&quot;) is an irregularly shaped region within the prokaryotic cell that contains all or most of the genetic material. The chromosome of a typical prokaryote is circular, and its length is very large compared to the cell dimensions, so it needs to be compacted in order to fit. In contrast to the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, it is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Instead, the nucleoid forms by condensation and functional arrangement with the help of chromosomal architectural proteins and RNA molecules as well as DNA supercoiling. The length of a genome widely varies (generally at least a few million base pairs) and a cell may contain multiple copies of it.

There is not yet a high-resolution structure known of a bacterial nucleoid, however key features have been researched in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; as a model organism. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, the chromosomal DNA is on average negatively supercoiled and folded into plectonemic loops, which are confined to different physical regions, and rarely diffuse into each other. These loops spatially organize into megabase-sized regions called macrodomains, within which DNA sites frequently interact, but between which interactions are rare. The condensed and spatially organized DNA forms a helical ellipsoid that is radially confined in the cell. The 3D structure of the DNA in the nucleoid appears to vary depending on conditions and is linked to gene expression so that the nucleoid architecture and gene transcription are tightly interdependent, influencing each other reciprocally.

== Background ==
In many bacteria, the chromosome is a single covalently closed (circular) double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes the genetic information in a (monoploid) form. The size of the DNA varies from 500,000 to several million base pairs (bp) encoding from 500 to several thousand genes depending on the organism. The chromosomal DNA is present in cells in a highly compact, organized form called the nucleoid (meaning &quot;nucleus-like&quot;), which is not encased by a as in eukaryotic cells. The isolated nucleoid contains 80% DNA, 10% protein, and 10% RNA by weight.

The gram-negative bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is a model system for nucleoid research into how chromosomal DNA becomes the nucleoid, the factors involved therein, what is known about its structure, and how some of the DNA structural aspects influence gene expression.

There are two essential aspects of nucleoid formation; condensation of a large DNA into a small cellular space and functional organization of DNA in a three-dimensional form. The haploid circular chromosome in &quot;E. coli&quot; consists of ~ 4.6 x 106 bp. If DNA is relaxed in the , it would have a circumference of ~1.5 millimeters (0.332 nm x 4.6 x 106). However, a large DNA molecule such as the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosomal DNA does not remain a straight rigid molecule in a suspension. Brownian motion will generate curvature and bends in DNA. The maximum length up to which a double-helical DNA remains straight by resisting the bending enforced by Brownian motion is ~50 nm or 150 bp, which is called the persistence length. Thus, pure DNA becomes substantially condensed without any additional factors; at thermal equilibrium, it assumes a random coil form. The random coil of &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosomal DNA would occupy a volume (4/3 π r3) of ~ 523 μm3, calculated from the radius of gyration (&quot;Rg = (√N a)/√6)&quot; where &quot;a&quot; is the Kuhn length (2 x persistence length), and &quot;N&quot; is the number of Kuhn length segments in the DNA (total length of the DNA divided by &quot;a&quot;). Although DNA is already condensed in the random coil form, it still cannot assume the volume of the nucleoid which is less than a micron. Thus, the inherent property of DNA is not sufficient: additional factors must help condense DNA further on the order of ~103 (volume of the random coil divided by the nucleoid volume). The second essential aspect of nucleoid formation is the functional arrangement of DNA. Chromosomal DNA is not only condensed but also functionally organized in a way that is compatible with DNA transaction processes such as , , , and . Almost five decades of research beginning in 1971, has shown that the final form of the nucleoid arises from a hierarchical organization of DNA. At the smallest scale (1 kb or less), nucleoid-associated DNA architectural proteins condense and organize DNA by bending, looping, bridging or wrapping DNA. At a larger scale (10 kb or larger), DNA forms plectonemic loops, a braided form of DNA induced by supercoiling. At the megabase scale, the plectonemic loops coalesce into six spatially organized domains (macrodomains), which are defined by more frequent physical interactions among DNA sites within the same macrodomain than between different macrodomains. Long- and short-range DNA-DNA connections formed within and between the macrodomains contribute to condensation and functional organization. Finally, the nucleoid is a helical ellipsoid with regions of highly condensed DNA at the longitudinal axis.

== Condensation and organization ==
=== Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) ===
In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is condensed in the form of a repeating array of DNA-protein particles called .

A nucleosome consists of ~146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octameric complex of the histone proteins. Although bacteria do not have histones, they possess a group of DNA binding proteins referred to as nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) that are functionally analogous to histones in a broad sense. NAPs are highly abundant and constitute a significant proportion of the protein component of nucleoid.

A distinctive characteristic of NAPs is their ability to bind DNA in both a specific (either sequence- or structure-specific) and non-sequence specific manner. As a result, NAPs are dual function proteins. The specific binding of NAPs is mostly involved in gene-specific , DNA replication, , and . At the peak of their abundance, the number of molecules of many NAPs is several orders of magnitude higher than the number of specific binding sites in the genome. Therefore, it is reasoned that NAPs bind to the chromosomal DNA mostly in the non-sequence specific mode and it is this mode that is crucial for chromosome compaction. Non-sequence specific binding of a NAP may not be completely random; there could be low-sequence specificity and or structural specificity due to sequence-dependent DNA conformation or DNA conformation created by other NAPs.

Although molecular mechanisms of how NAPs condense DNA &quot;in vivo&quot; are not well understood, based on the extensive &quot;in vitro&quot; studies it appears that NAPs participate in chromosome compaction via the following mechanisms: NAPs induce and stabilize bends in DNA, thus aid in DNA condensation by reducing the persistence length. NAPs condense DNA by bridging, wrapping, and bunching that could occur between nearby DNA segments or distant DNA segments of the chromosome. Another mechanism by which NAPs participate in chromosome compaction is by constraining in DNA thus contributing to the topological organization of the chromosome.

There are at least 12 NAPs identified in &quot;E. coli,&quot; the most extensively studied of which are HU, IHF, H-NS, and Fis. Their abundance and DNA binding properties and effect on DNA condensation and organization are summarized in the tables below.

1 Abundance (molecules/cell) data were taken from; The number in the parenthesis is micromolar concentration calculated using the following formula: (number of native functional units/Avogadro number) x (1/cell volume in liter) x 103. Cell volume in liter ( 2 x 10−15) was determined by assuming volume of the &quot;E. coli&quot; cell to be 2 μm3.

1 Binding affinity refers to equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) in molar units (M). ND = not determined

==== HU ====
Histone-like protein from &quot;E. coli&quot; strain U93 (HU) is an evolutionarily conserved protein in bacteria. HU exists in &quot;E. coli&quot; as homo- and heterodimers of two subunits HUα and HUβ sharing 69% amino acid identity. Although it is referred to as a histone-like protein, close functional relatives of HU in eukaryotes are high-mobility group (HMG) proteins, and not histones. HU is a non-sequence specific DNA binding protein. It binds with low-affinity to any linear DNA. However, it preferentially binds with high-affinity to a structurally distorted DNA. Examples of distorted DNA substrates include cruciform DNA, bulged DNA, dsDNA containing a single-stranded break such as , gaps, or . Furthermore, HU specifically binds and stabilizes a protein-mediated DNA loop. In the structurally specific DNA binding mode, HU recognizes a common structural motif defined by bends or kinks created by distortion, whereas it binds to a linear DNA by locking the phosphate backbone. While the high-affinity structurally-specific binding is required for specialized functions of HU such as site-specific recombination, DNA repair, initiation, and gene regulation, it appears that the low-affinity general binding is involved in DNA condensation. In chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing (), HU does not reveal any specific binding events. Instead, it displays a uniform binding across the genome presumably reflecting its mostly weak, non-sequence specific binding, thus masking the high-affinity binding &quot;in vivo&quot;.

In strains lacking HU, the nucleoid is &quot;decondensed&quot;, consistent with a role of HU in DNA compaction. The following &quot;in vitro&quot; studies suggest possible mechanisms of how HU might condense and organize DNA &quot;in vivo&quot;. Not only HU stably binds to distorted DNA with bends, it induces flexible bends even in a linear DNA at less than 100 nM concentration. In contrast, HU shows the opposite architectural effect on DNA at higher physiologically relevant concentrations. It forms rigid nucleoprotein filaments causing the straitening of DNA and not the bending. The filaments can further form a DNA network (DNA bunching) expandable both laterally and medially because of the HU-HU multimerization triggered by the non-sequence-specific DNA binding.

How are these behaviors of HU relevant inside the cell? The formation of filaments requires high-density binding of HU on DNA, one HU dimer per 9-20 bp DNA. But there is only one HU dimer every ~150 bp of the chromosomal DNA based on the estimated abundance of 30,000 HU dimers per cell (4600000 bp /30,000). This indicates that the flexible bends are more likely to occur &quot;in vivo&quot;. The flexible bending would cause condensation due to a reduction in the persistence length of DNA as shown by magnetic tweezers experiments, which allow studying condensation of a single DNA molecule by a DNA binding protein. However, because of the , the rigid filaments and networks could form in some regions in the chromosome. The filament formation alone does not induce condensation, but DNA networking or bunching can substantially contribute to condensation by bringing distant or nearby chromosome segments together.

==== IHF ====
Integration host factor (IHF) is structurally almost identical to HU but behaves differently from HU in many aspects. Unlike HU, which preferentially binds to a structural motif regardless of the sequence, IHF preferentially binds to a specific DNA sequence even though the specificity arises through the sequence-dependent DNA structure and deformability. The specific binding of IHF at cognate sites bends DNA sharply by &gt;160-degree. An occurrence of the cognate sequence motif is about 3000 in the &quot;E. coli&quot; genome. The estimated abundance of IHF in the growth phase is about 6000 dimers per cell. Assuming that one IHF dimer binds to a single motif and nucleoid contains more than one genome equivalent during the exponential growth phase, most of the IHF molecules would occupy specific sites in the genome and likely only condense DNA by inducing sharp bending.

Besides preferential binding to a specific DNA sequence, IHF also binds to DNA in a non-sequence specific manner with the affinities similar to HU. A role of the non-specific binding of IHF in DNA condensation appears to be critical in the stationary phase because the IHF abundance increases by five-fold in the stationary phase and the additional IHF dimers would likely bind the chromosomal DNA non-specifically. Unlike HU, IHF does not form thick rigid filaments at higher concentrations. Instead, its non-specific binding also induces DNA bending albeit the degree of bending is much smaller than that at specific sites and is similar to the flexible bending induced by HU in a linear DNA at low concentrations. &quot;In vitro&quot;, the bending induced by non-specific binding of IHF can cause DNA condensation and promotes the formation of higher-order nucleoprotein complexes depending on the concentrations of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride. The higher-order DNA organization by IHF &quot;in vivo&quot; is as yet unclear.

==== H-NS ====
A distinguishable feature of histone-like or heat-stable nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) from other NAPs is the ability to switch from the homodimeric form at relatively low concentrations (&lt;1 x 10−5 M) to an oligomeric state at higher levels. Because of oligomerization properties, H-NS spreads laterally along AT-rich DNA in a nucleation reaction, where high-affinity sites function as nucleation centers. The spreading of H-NS on DNA results in two opposite outcomes depending on the magnesium concentration in the reaction. At low magnesium concentration (&lt; 2 mM), H-NS forms rigid nucleoprotein filaments whereas it forms inter- and intra-molecular bridges at higher magnesium concentrations (&gt; 5 mM). The formation of rigid filaments results in straightening of DNA with no condensation whereas the bridging causes substantial DNA folding. Analysis of H-NS binding in the genome by assays provided indirect evidence for the spreading of H-NS on DNA &quot;in vivo&quot;. H-NS binds selectively to 458 regions in the genome. Although H-NS has been demonstrated to prefer curved DNA formed by repeated A-tracks in DNA sequences the basis of the selective binding is the presence of a conserved sequence motif found in AT-rich regions. More importantly, the frequent occurrence of the sequence motif within an H-NS binding region that can re-enforce the cooperative protein-protein interactions, and the unusually long length of the binding region are consistent with the spreading of the protein. Whether the filament formation or DNA bridging is prevalent &quot;in vivo&quot; depends on the physiological concentration of magnesium inside the cell. If the magnesium concentration is uniformly low (&lt; 5 mM), H-NS would form rigid nucleoprotein filaments &quot;in vivo&quot;. Alternatively, if there is an uneven distribution of magnesium in the cell, it could promote both DNA bridging and stiffening but in different regions of the nucleoid.

Furthermore, H-NS is best known as a global gene silencer that preferentially inhibits transcription of horizontally transferred genes and it is the rigid filament that leads to gene silencing. Taken together, it appears that the formation of rigid filaments is the most likely outcome of H-NS-DNA interactions &quot;in vivo&quot; that leads to gene silencing but does not induce DNA condensation. Consistently, the absence of H-NS does not change the nucleoid volume. However, it is possible that &quot;E. coli&quot; experiences high-magnesium concentration under some environmental conditions. In such conditions, H-NS can switch from its filament inducing form to the bridge inducing form that contributes to DNA condensation and organization.

==== Fis ====

Factor for Inversion Stimulation (Fis) is a sequence specific DNA binding protein that binds to specific DNA sequences containing a 15-bp symmetric motif. Like IHF, Fis induces DNA bending at cognate sites. The ability to bend DNA is apparent in the structure of Fis homodimer. A Fis homodimer possesses two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs, one from each monomer. An HTH motif typically recognizes the DNA major groove. However, the distance between the DNA recognition helices of the two HTH motifs in the Fis homodimer is 25 Å, that is ~ 8 Å shorter than the pitch of a canonical , indicating that the protein must bend or twist DNA to bind stably. Consistently, the crystal structure of Fis-DNA complexes shows that the distance between the recognition helices remains unchanged whereas DNA curves in the range of 60-75 degree. There are 1464 Fis binding regions distributed across the &quot;E. coli&quot; genome and a binding motif, identified computationally, matches with the known 15-bp motif. Specific binding of Fis at such sites would induce bends in DNA, thus contribute to DNA condensation by reducing persistence length of DNA. Furthermore, many Fis binding sites occur in tandem such as those in the stable RNA promoters, e.g., &quot;P1&quot; promoter of rRNA operon &quot;rrnB&quot;. The coherent bending by Fis at the tandem sites is likely to create a DNA micro-loop that can further contribute to DNA condensation.

Besides high-affinity specific binding to cognate sites, Fis can bind to a random DNA sequence. The non-specific DNA binding is significant because Fis is as abundant as HU in the . Therefore, most of Fis molecules are expected to bind DNA in a non-sequence specific manner. Magnetic tweezers experiments show that this non-specific binding of Fis can contribute to DNA condensation and organization. Fis causes mild condensation of a single DNA molecule at &lt;1 mM, but induces substantial folding through the formation of DNA loops of an average size of ~800 bp at &gt;1 mM. The loops in magnetic tweezers experiments are distinct from the micro-loops created by coherent DNA bending at cognate sites, as they require the formation of high-density DNA-protein complexes achieved by sequence-independent binding. Although, occurrence of such loops &quot;in vivo&quot; remains to be demonstrated, high-density binding of Fis may occur &quot;in vivo&quot; through concerted action of both specific and non-specific binding. The in-tandem occurrence of specific sites might initiate a nucleation reaction similar to that of H-NS, and then non-specific binding would lead to the formation of localized high-density Fis arrays. The bridging between these localized regions can create large DNA loops. Fis is exclusively present in the and not in the . Thus, any role in chromosomal condensation by Fis must be specific to growing cells.

=== Nucleoid-associated RNAs (naRNAs) ===
Early studies examining the effect of RNase A treatment on isolated nucleoids indicated that RNA participated in the stabilization of the nucleoid in the condensed state. Moreover, treatment with RNase A disrupted the DNA fibers into thinner fibers, as observed by an atomic force microscopy of the nucleoid using the “on-substrate lysis procedure”. These findings demonstrated the participation of RNA in the nucleoid structure, but the identity of the RNA molecule(s) remained unknown until recently. Most of the studies on HU focused on its DNA binding. However, HU also binds to and RNA-DNA hybrids with a lower affinity similar to that with a linear dsDNA. Moreover, HU preferentially binds to RNA containing secondary structures and an RNA-DNA hybrid in which the RNA contains a nick or overhang. The binding affinities of HU with these RNA substrates are similar to those with which it binds to distorted DNA. An immunoprecipitation of HU-bound RNA coupled to reverse transcription and microarray (RIP-Chip) study as well as an analysis of RNA from purified intact nucleoids identified nucleoid-associated RNA molecules that interact with HU. Several of them are non-coding RNAs, and one such RNA named naRNA4 (nucleoid-associated RNA 4), is encoded in a repetitive extragenic palindrome (&quot;REP325&quot;). In a strain lacking &quot;REP325&quot;, the nucleoid is decondensed as it is in a strain lacking HU. naRNA4 most likely participate in DNA condensation by connecting DNA segments in the presence of HU. Recent studies provide insights into the molecular mechanism of how naRNA4 establishes DNA-DNA connections. The RNA targets regions of DNA containing cruciform structures and forms an RNA-DNA complex that is critical for establishing DNA-DNA connections. Surprisingly, although HU helps in the formation of the complex, it is not present in the final complex, indicating its potential role as a catalyst (chaperone). The nature of the RNA-DNA complex remains puzzling because the formation of the complex does not involve extensive Watson/Crick base pairing but is sensitive to RNase H, which cleaves RNA in an RNA-DNA hybrid and the complex binds to an antibody specific to RNA-DNA hybrids.

=== Supercoiling ===
Because of its , a double-stranded DNA molecule becomes topologically constrained in the covalently closed circular form which eliminates the rotation of the free ends. The number of times the two strands cross each other in a topologically constrained DNA is called the linking number (Lk), which is equivalent to the number of helical turns or twists in a circular molecule. The Lk of a DNA remains invariant, no matter how the DNA molecule is deformed, as long as neither strand is broken.

The Lk of DNA in the relaxed form is defined as Lk0. For any DNA, Lk0 can be calculated by dividing the length (in bp) of the DNA by the number of bp per helical turn. This is equal to 10.4 bp for the relaxed . Any deviation from Lk0 causes in DNA. A decrease in the linking number (Lk&lt;Lk0) creates negative supercoiling whereas an increase in the linking number (Lk&gt;Lk0) creates positive supercoiling.

The supercoiled state (when Lk is not equal to Lk0) results in a transition in DNA structure that can manifest as a change in the number of twists (negative &lt;10.4 bp/turn, positive &gt;10.4 bp per turn) and/or in the formation of , called supercoils. Thus, Lk is mathematically defined as a sign dependent sum of the two geometric parameters, twist and writhe. A quantitative measure of supercoiling that is independent of the size of DNA molecules is the supercoiling density (σ) where σ =∆Lk/Lk0.

Writhes can adopt two structures; plectoneme and solenoid or toroid. A plectonemic structure arises from the interwinding of the helical axis. Toroidal supercoils originate when DNA forms several spirals, around an axis and not intersecting with each other, like those in a telephone cord. The writhes in the plectonemes form are right- and left-handed in positively or negatively supercoiled DNA, respectively. The handedness of the toroidal supercoils is opposite to those of plectonemes. Both plectonemes and toroidal supercoils can be either in a free form or restrained in a bound form with proteins. The best example of the bound toroidal supercoiling in biology is the eukaryotic nucleosome in which DNA wraps around .

=== Plectonemic supercoils in &quot;E. coli&quot; ===
In most bacteria, DNA is present in supercoiled form. The circular nature of the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome makes it topologically constrained molecule that is mostly negatively supercoiled with an estimated average supercoiling density (σ) of -0.05. In the eukaryotic chromatin, DNA is found mainly in the toroidal form that is restrained and defined by histones through the formation of nucleosomes. In contrast, in the &quot;E. coli&quot; nucleoid, about half of the chromosomal DNA is organized in the form of free, plectonemic supercoils. The remaining DNA is restrained in either the plectonemic form or alternative forms, including but not limited to the toroidal form, by interaction with proteins such as NAPs. Thus, plectonemic supercoils represent effective supercoiling of the &quot;E. coli&quot; genome that is responsible for its condensation and organization. Both plectonemic and toroidal supercoiling aid in DNA condensation. Branching of plectonemic structures provides less DNA condensation than does the toroidal structure. A same size DNA molecule with equal supercoiling densities is more compact in a toroidal form than in a plectonemic form. In addition to condensing DNA, supercoiling aids in DNA organization. It promotes disentanglement of DNA by reducing the probability of catenation. Supercoiling also helps bring two distant sites of DNA in proximity thereby promoting a potential functional interaction between different segments of DNA.

==== Sources of supercoiling in &quot;E. coli&quot; ====
Three factors contribute to generating and maintaining chromosomal DNA supercoiling in &quot;E. coli&quot;: (i) activities of , (ii) the act of , and (iii) NAPs.

===== Topoisomerases =====
 are a particular category of DNA metabolic enzymes that create or remove supercoiling by breaking and then re-ligating DNA strands. &quot;E. coli&quot; possesses four topoisomerases. DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoiling in the presence of ATP and it removes positive supercoiling in the absence of ATP. Across all forms of life, DNA gyrase is the only topoisomerase that can create negative supercoiling and it is because of this unique ability that bacterial genomes possess free negative supercoils; DNA gyrase is found in all bacteria but absent from higher eukaryotes. In contrast, Topo I opposes DNA gyrase by relaxing the negatively supercoiled DNA. There is genetic evidence to suggest that a balance between the opposing activities of DNA gyrase and Topo I are responsible for maintaining a steady-state level of average negative superhelicity in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Both enzymes are essential for &quot;E. coli&quot; survival. A null strain of &quot;topA&quot;, the gene encoding Topo I, survives only because of the presence of suppressor mutations in the genes encoding DNA gyrase. These mutations result in reduced gyrase activity, suggesting that excess negative supercoiling due to the absence of Topo I is compensated by reduced negative supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase. Topo III is dispensable in &quot;E. coli&quot; and is not known to have any role in supercoiling in &quot;E. coli.&quot; The primary function of Topo IV is to resolve sister chromosomes. However, it has been shown to also contribute to the steady-state level of negative supercoiling by relaxing negative supercoiling together with Topo I.

===== Transcription =====
A twin supercoiling domain model proposed by Liu and Wang argued that unwinding of during transcription induces supercoiling in DNA as shown in. According to their model, transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) sliding along DNA forces the DNA to rotate on its helical axis. A hindrance in the free rotation of DNA might arise due to a topological constraint, causing the DNA in front of RNAP to become over-twisted (positively supercoiled) and the DNA behind RNAP would become under-twisted (negatively supercoiled). It has been found that a topological constraint is not needed because RNAP generates sufficient torque that causes supercoiling even in a linear DNA template. If DNA is already negatively supercoiled, this action relaxes existing negative supercoils before causing a buildup of positive supercoils ahead of RNAP and introduces more negative supercoils behind RNAP. In principle, DNA gyrase and Topo I should remove excess positive and negative supercoils respectively but if the RNAP elongation rate exceeds the turnover of the two enzymes, transcription contributes to the steady-state level of supercoiling.

===== Control of supercoiling by NAPs =====
In the eukaryotic chromatin, DNA is rarely present in the free supercoiled form because nucleosomes restrain almost all negative supercoiling through tight binding of DNA to histones. Similarly, in &quot;E. coli&quot;, nucleoprotein complexes formed by NAPs restrain half of the supercoiling density of the nucleoid. In other words, if a NAP dissociates from a , the DNA would adopt the free, plectonemic form. DNA binding of HU, Fis, and H-NS has been experimentally shown to restrain negative supercoiling in a relaxed but topologically constrained DNA. They can do so either by changing the helical pitch of DNA or generating toroidal writhes by DNA bending and wrapping. Alternatively, NAPs can preferentially bind to and stabilize other forms of the underwound DNA such as cruciform structures and branched plectonemes. Fis has been reported to organize branched plectonemes through its binding to cross-over regions and HU preferentially binds to cruciform structures.

NAPs also regulate DNA supercoiling indirectly. Fis can modulate supercoiling by repressing the transcription of the genes encoding DNA gyrase. There is genetic evidence to suggest that HU controls supercoiling levels by stimulating DNA gyrase and reducing the activity of Topo I. In support of the genetic studies, HU was shown to stimulate DNA gyrase-catalyzed decatenation of DNA &quot;in vitro&quot;. It is unclear mechanistically how HU modulates the activities of the gyrase and Topo I. HU might physically interact with DNA gyrase and Topo I or DNA organization activities of HU such as DNA bending may facilitate or inhibit the action of DNA gyrase and Topo I respectively.

==== Plectonemic supercoils organize into multiple topological domains ====
One of the striking features of the nucleoid is that plectonemic supercoils are organized into multiple topological domains. In other words, a single cut in one domain will only relax that domain and not the others. A topological domain forms because of a supercoiling-diffusion barrier. Independent studies employing different methods have reported that the topological domains are variable in size ranging from 10 to 400 kb. A random placement of barriers commonly observed in these studies seems to explain the wide variability in the size of domains.

Although identities of domain barriers remain to be established, possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of the barriers include: (i) A domain barrier could form when a protein with an ability to restrain supercoils simultaneously binds to two distinct sites on the chromosome forming a topologically isolated DNA loop or domain. It has been experimentally demonstrated that protein-mediated looping in supercoiled DNA can create a topological domain. NAPs such as H-NS and Fis are potential candidates, based on their DNA looping abilities and the distribution of their binding sites. (ii) Bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs) also appear as potential candidates for domain barriers. BIMEs are palindromic repeats sequences that are usually found between genes. A BIME has been shown to impede diffusion of supercoiling in a synthetically designed topological cassette inserted in the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome. There are ~600 BIMEs distributed across the genome, possibly dividing the chromosome into 600 topological domains. (iii) Barriers could also result from the attachment of DNA to the cell membrane through a protein which binds to both DNA and membrane or through nascent transcription and the translation of membrane-anchored proteins. (iv) Transcription activity can generate supercoiling-diffusion barriers. An actively transcribing RNAP has been shown to block dissipation of plectonemic supercoils, thereby forming a supercoiling-diffusion barrier.

== Growth-phase dependent nucleoid dynamics ==
The nucleoid reorganizes in stationary phase cells suggesting that the nucleoid structure is highly dynamic, determined by the physiological state of cells. A comparison of high-resolution contact maps of the nucleoid revealed that the long-range contacts in the Ter macrodomain increased in the , compared to the . Furthermore, CID boundaries in the stationary phase were different from those found in the growth phase. Finally, nucleoid morphology undergoes massive transformation during prolonged stationary phase; the nucleoid exhibits ordered, toroidal structures.

Growth-phase specific changes in nucleoid structure could be brought about by a change in levels of nucleoid-associated DNA architectural proteins (the NAPs and the Muk subunits), supercoiling, and transcription activity. The abundance of NAPs and the Muk subunits changes according to the bacterial growth cycle. Fis and the starvation-induced DNA binding protein Dps, another NAP, are almost exclusively present in the growth phase and stationary phase respectively. Fis levels rise upon entry into exponential phase and then rapidly decline while cells are still in the exponential phase, reaching levels that are undetectable in stationary phase. While Fis levels start to decline, levels of Dps start to rise and reach a maximum in the stationary phase. A dramatic transition in the nucleoid structure observed in the prolonged stationary phase has been mainly attributed to Dps. It forms DNA/ assemblies that act to protect the nucleoid from DNA damaging agents present during starvation.

HU, IHF, and H-NS are present in both growth phase and stationary phase. However, their abundance changes significantly such that HU and Fis are the most abundant NAPs in the growth phase, whereas IHF and Dps become the most abundant NAPs in the stationary phase. HUαα is the predominant form in early exponential phase, whereas the heterodimeric form predominates in the stationary phase, with minor amounts of homodimers. This transition has functional consequences regarding nucleoid structure, because the two forms appear to organize and condense DNA differently; both homo- and heterodimers form filaments, but only the homodimer can bring multiple DNA segments together to form a DNA network. The copy number of MukB increases two-fold in stationary phase. An increase in the number of MukB molecules could have influence on the processivity of the MukBEF complex as a DNA loop extruding factor resulting in larger or a greater number of the loops.

Supercoiling can act in a concerted manner with DNA architectural proteins to reorganize the nucleoid. The overall supercoiling level decreases in the stationary phase, and supercoiling exhibits a different pattern at the regional level. Changes in supercoiling can alter the topological organization of the nucleoid. Furthermore, because a chromosomal region of high transcription activity forms a CID boundary, changes in transcription activity during different growth phases could alter the formation of CID boundaries, and thus the spatial organization of the nucleoid. It is possible that changes in CID boundaries observed in the stationary phase could be due to the high expression of a different set of genes in the stationary phase compared to the growth phase.

== Nucleoid structure and gene expression ==
=== NAPs and gene expression ===
The &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome structure and gene expression appear to influence each other reciprocally. On the one hand, a correlation of a CID boundary with high transcription activity indicates that chromosome organization is driven by transcription. On the other hand, the 3D structure of DNA within nucleoid at every scale may be linked to gene expression. First, it has been shown that reorganization of the 3D architecture of the nucleoid in &quot;E. coli&quot; can dynamically modulate cellular transcription pattern. A mutant of HUa made the nucleoid very much condensed by increased positive superhelicity of the chromosomal DNA. Consequently, many genes were repressed, and many quiescent genes were expressed. Besides, there are many specific cases in which protein-mediated local architectural changes alter gene transcription. For example, the formation of rigid nucleoprotein filaments by H-NS blocks RNAP access to the promoter thus prevent gene transcription. Through gene silencing, H-NS acts as a global repressor preferentially inhibiting transcription of horizontally transferred genes. In another example, specific binding of HU at the &quot;gal&quot; operon facilitates the formation of a DNA loop that keeps the &quot;gal&quot; operon repressed in the absence of the inducer. The topologically distinct DNA micro-loop created by coherent bending of DNA by Fis at stable RNA promoters activates transcription. DNA bending by IHF differentially controls transcription from the two tandem promoters of the &quot;ilvGMEDA&quot; operon in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Specific topological changes by NAPs not only regulate gene transcription, but are also involved in other processes such as DNA replication initiation, recombination, and transposition. In contrast to specific gene regulation, how higher-order chromosome structure and its dynamics influences gene expression globally at the molecular level remains to be worked out.

=== DNA supercoiling and gene expression ===
A two-way interconnectedness exists between DNA supercoiling and gene transcription. Negative supercoiling of the promoter region can stimulate transcription by facilitating the promoter melting and by increasing the DNA binding affinity of a protein regulator. Stochastic bursts of transcription appear to be a general characteristic of highly expressed genes, and supercoiling levels of the DNA template contributes to transcriptional bursting. According to the twin supercoiling domain model, transcription of a gene can influence transcription of other nearby genes through a supercoiling relay. One such example is the activation of the &quot;leu-500&quot; promoter. Supercoiling not only mediates gene-specific changes, but it also mediates large-scale changes in gene expression. Topological organization of the nucleoid could allow independent expression of supercoiling-sensitive genes in different topological domains. A genome-scale map of unrestrained supercoiling showed that genomic regions have different steady-state supercoiling densities, indicating that the level of supercoiling differs in individual topological domains. As a result, a change in supercoiling can result in domain-specific gene expression, depending on the level of supercoiling in each domain.

The effect of supercoiling on gene expression can be mediated by NAPs that directly or indirectly influence supercoiling. The effect of HU on gene expression appears to involve a change in supercoiling and perhaps a higher-order DNA organization. A positive correlation between DNA gyrase binding and upregulation of the genes caused by the absence of HU suggests that changes in supercoiling are responsible for differential expression. HU was also found to be responsible for a positional effect on gene expression by insulating transcriptional units by constraining transcription-induced supercoiling. Point mutations in HUa dramatically changed the gene expression profile of &quot;E. coli,&quot; altering its , physiology, and metabolism. As a result, the mutant strain was more invasive of mammalian cells. This dramatic effect was concomitant with nucleoid compaction and increased positive supercoiling. The mutant protein was an octamer, in contrast to the wild-type dimer. It wraps DNA on its surface in a right-handed manner, restraining positive supercoils as opposed to wild-type HU. These studies show that amino acid substitutions in HU can have a dramatic effect on nucleoid structure, that in turn results in significant phenotypic changes.

Since MukB and HU have emerged as critical players in long-range DNA interactions, it will be worthwhile to compare the effect of each of these two proteins on global gene expression. Although HU appears to control gene expression by modulating supercoiling density, the exact molecular mechanism remains unknown and the impact of MukB on gene expression is yet to be analyzed.

== Spatial organization ==

=== Chromosomal interaction domains ===
In recent years, the advent of a molecular method called chromosome conformation capture (3C) has allowed studying a high-resolution spatial organization of chromosomes in both bacteria and eukaryotes. 3C and its version that is coupled with (Hi-C) determine physical proximity, if any, between any two genomic loci in 3D space. A high-resolution contact map of bacterial chromosomes including the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome has revealed that a bacterial chromosome is segmented into many highly self-interacting regions called chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs). CIDs are equivalent to (TADs) observed in many eukaryotic chromosomes, suggesting that the formation of CIDs is a general phenomenon of genome organization. Two characteristics define CIDs or TADs. First, genomic regions of a CID physically interact with each other more frequently than with the genomic regions outside that CID or with those of a neighboring CID. Second, the presence of a boundary between CIDs that prevents physical interactions between genomic regions of two neighboring CIDs.

The &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome was found to consist of 31 CIDs in the growth phase. The size of the CIDs ranged from 40 to ~300 kb. It appears that a supercoiling-diffusion barrier responsible for segregating plectonemic DNA loops into topological domains functions as a CID boundary in &quot;E. coli&quot; and many other bacteria. In other words, the presence of a supercoiling-diffusion barrier defines the formation of CIDs. Findings from the Hi-C probing of chromosomes in &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot;, and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; converge on a model that CIDs form because plectonemic looping together with DNA organization activities of NAPs promotes physical interactions among genomic loci, and a CID boundary consists of a plectoneme-free region (PFR) that prevents these interactions. A PFR is created due to high transcription activity because the helical unwinding of DNA by actively transcribing RNAP restrains plectonemic supercoils. As a result, dissipation of supercoils is also blocked, creating a supercoiling-diffusion barrier. Indirect evidence for this model comes from an observation that CIDs of bacterial chromosomes including the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome display highly transcribed genes at their boundaries, indicating a role of transcription in the formation of a CID boundary. More direct evidence came from a finding that the placement of a highly transcribed gene at a position where no boundary was present created a new CID boundary in the &quot;C. crescentus&quot; chromosome. However, not all CID boundaries correlated with highly transcribed genes in the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome suggesting that other unknown factors are also responsible for the formation of CID boundaries and supercoiling diffusion barriers.

=== Macrodomains ===
Plectonemic DNA loops organized as topological domains or CIDs appear to coalesce further to form large spatially distinct domains called macrodomains (MDs). In &quot;E. coli,&quot; MDs were initially identified as large segments of the genome whose DNA markers localized together (co-localized) in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. A large genomic region (~1-Mb) covering &quot;&quot; (origin of chromosome replication) locus co-localized and was called Ori macrodomain. Likewise, a large genomic region (~1-Mb) covering the replication terminus region (&quot;ter&quot;) co-localized and was called Ter macrodomain. MDs were later identified based on how frequently pairs of lambda &quot;att&quot; sites that were inserted at various distant locations in the chromosome recombined with each other. In this recombination-based method, an MD was defined as a large genomic region whose DNA sites can primarily recombine with each other, but not with those outside of that MD. The recombination-based method confirmed the Ori and Ter MDs that were identified in FISH studies and identified two additional MDs.

The two additional MDs were formed by the additional ~1-Mb regions flanking the Ter and were referred to as Left and Right. These four MDs (Ori, Ter, Left, and Right) composed most of the genome, except for two genomic regions flanking the Ori. These two regions (NS-L and NS-R) were more flexible and non-structured compared to an MD as DNA sites in them recombined with DNA sites located in MDs on both sides. The genetic position of &quot;oriC&quot; appears to dictate the formation of MDs, because repositioning of &quot;oriC&quot; by genetic manipulation results in the reorganization of MDs. For example, genomic regions closest to the &quot;oriC&quot; always behave as an NS regardless of DNA sequence and regions further away always behave as MDs.

The Hi-C technique further confirmed a hierarchical spatial organization of CIDs in the form of macrodomains. In other words, CIDs of a macrodomain physically interacted with each other more frequently than with CIDs of a neighboring macrodomain or with genomic loci outside of that macrodomain. The Hi-C data showed that the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome was partitioning into two distinct domains. The region surrounding &quot;ter&quot; formed an insulated domain that overlapped with the previously identified Ter MD. DNA-DNA contacts in this domain occurred only in the range of up to ~280 kb. The rest of the chromosome formed a single domain whose genomic loci exhibited contacts in the range of &gt;280-kb. While most of the contacts in this domain were restricted to a maximum distance of ~500 kb, there were two loose regions whose genomic loci formed contacts at even greater distances (up to ~1 Mb). These loose regions corresponded to the previously identified flexible and less-structured regions (NS). The boundaries of the insulated domain encompassing &quot;ter&quot; and the two loose regions identified by the Hi-C method segmented the entire chromosome into six regions that correspond with the four MDs and two NS regions defined by recombination-based assays.

==== Proteins that drive macrodomain formation ====

===== MatP =====
A search for protein(s) responsible for macrodomain formation led to identification of Macrodomain Ter protein (MatP). MatP almost exclusively binds in the Ter MD by recognizing a 13-bp motif called the macrodomain &quot;ter&quot; sequence (&quot;matS&quot;). There are 23 &quot;matS&quot; sites present in the Ter domain, on average there is one site every 35-kb. Further evidence of MatP binding in the Ter domain comes from fluorescence imaging of MatP. Discrete MatP foci were observed that co-localized with Ter domain DNA markers. A strong enrichment of signal in the Ter MD also corroborates the preferential binding of MatP to this domain.

MatP condenses DNA in the Ter domain because the lack of MatP increased the distance between two fluorescent DNA markers located 100-kb apart in the Ter domain. Furthermore, MatP is a critical player in insulating the Ter domain from the rest of the chromosome. It promotes DNA-DNA contacts within the Ter domain but prevents contacts between the DNA loci of Ter domain and those of flanking regions. How does MatP condense DNA and promote DNA-DNA contacts? The experimental results are conflicting. MatP can form a DNA loop between two &quot;matS&quot; sites &quot;in vitro&quot; and its DNA looping activity depends on MatP tetramerization. Tetramerization occurs via coiled-coil interactions between two MatP molecules bound to DNA. One obvious model based on &quot;in vitro&quot; results is that MatP promotes DNA-DNA contacts &quot;in vivo&quot; by bridging &quot;matS&quot; sites. However, although MatP connected distant sites in Hi-C studies, it did not specifically connect the &quot;matS&quot; sites. Furthermore, a MatP mutant that was unable to form tetramers behaved like wild-type. These results argue against the &quot;matS&quot; bridging model for Ter organization, leaving the mechanism of MatP action elusive. One possibility is that MatP spreads to nearby DNA segments from its primary &quot;matS&quot; binding site and bridge distant sites via a mechanism that does not depend on the tetramerization.

===== MukBEF =====
MukB belongs to a family of ATPases called (SMCs), which participate in higher-order chromosome organization in eukaryotes. Two MukB monomers associate via continuous antiparallel coiled-coil interaction forming a 100-nm long rigid rod. A flexible hinge region occurs in the middle of the rod. Due to the flexibility of the hinge region, MukB adopts a characteristic V-shape of the SMC family. The non-SMC subunits associating with MukB are MukE and MukF. The association closes the V formation, resulting in large ring-like structures. MukE and MukF are encoded together with MukB in the same operon in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Deletion of either subunit results in the same phenotype suggesting that the MukBEF complex is the functional unit &quot;in vivo&quot;. DNA binding activities of the complex reside in the MukB subunit, whereas MukE and MukF modulate MukB activity.

MukBEF complex, together with Topo IV, is required for decatenation and repositioning of newly replicated &quot;oriC&quot;s. The role of MukBEF is not restricted during DNA replication. It organizes and condenses DNA even in non-replicating cells. The recent high-resolution chromosome conformation map of the MukB-depleted &quot;E. coli&quot; strain reveals that MukB participates in the formation of DNA-DNA interactions on the entire chromosome, except in the Ter domain. How is MukB prevented from acting in the Ter domain? MatP physically interacts with MukB, thus preventing MukB from localizing to the Ter domain. This is evident in the DNA binding of MatP and MukB in the Ter domain. DNA binding of MatP is enriched in the Ter domain, whereas DNA binding of MukB is reduced compared to the rest of the genome. Furthermore, in a strain already lacking MatP, the absence of MukB causes a reduction in DNA contacts throughout the chromosome, including the Ter domain. This result agrees with the view that MatP displaces MukB from the Ter domain.

How does the MukBEF complex function to organize the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome? According to the current view, SMC complexes organize chromosomes by extruding DNA loops. SMC complexes translocate along DNA to extrude loops in a cis-manner (on the same DNA molecule), wherein the size of loops depends on processivity of the complex. SMC complexes from different organisms differ in the mechanism of loop extrusion. Single molecule fluorescence microscopy of MukBEF in &quot;E. coli&quot; suggests that the minimum functional unit &quot;in vivo&quot; is a dimer of dimers. This unit is formed by joining of two ATP-bound MukBEF complexes through MukF-mediated dimerization. MukBEF localizes in the cell as 1-3 clusters that are elongated parallel to the long axis of the cell. Each cluster contains an average ~ 8-10 dimers of dimers. According to the current model, the MukBEF extrudes DNA loops in a “rock-climbing” manner. A dimer of the dimers releases one segment of DNA and capture a new DNA segment without dissociating from the chromosome. Besides DNA looping, a link between negative supercoiling and &quot;in vivo&quot; MukBEF function together with the ability of the MukB subunit to constrain negative supercoils &quot;in vitro&quot; suggests that MukBEF organizes DNA by generating supercoils.

=== Role of NAPs and naRNAs ===
In addition to contributing to the chromosome compaction by bending, bridging, and looping DNA at a smaller scale (~1-kb), NAPs participate in DNA condensation and organization by promoting long-rang DNA-DNA contacts. Two NAPs, Fis and HU, emerged as the key players in promoting long-range DNA-DNA contacts that occur throughout the chromosome. It remains to be studied how DNA organization activities of Fis and HU that are well understood at a smaller scale (~1-kb) results in the formation of long-range DNA-DNA interactions. Nonetheless, some of the HU-mediated DNA interactions require the presence of naRNA4. naRNA4 also participates in making long-range DNA contacts. HU catalyzes some of the contacts, not all, suggesting that RNA participates with other NAPs in forming DNA contacts. HU also appears to act together with MukB to promote long-range DNA-DNA interactions. This view is based on observations that the absence of either HU or MukB caused a reduction in the same DNA-DNA contacts. It is unclear how MukB and HU potentially act together in promoting DNA-DNA interactions. It is possible that the two proteins interact physically. Alternatively, while MukBEF extrudes large DNA loops, HU condenses and organizes those loops.

=== Role of functional relatedness of genes ===
There are reports that functionally-related genes of &quot;E. coli&quot; are physically together in 3-D space within the chromosome even though they are far apart by genetic distance. Spatial proximity of functionally-related genes not only make the biological functions more compartmentalized and efficient but would also contribute to the folding and spatial organization of the nucleoid. A recent study using fluorescent markers for detection of specific DNA loci examined pairwise physical distances between the seven rRNA operons that are genetically separated from each other (by as much as two million bp). It reported that all of the operons, except &quot;rrn&quot;C, were in physical proximity. Surprisingly, 3C-seq studies did not reveal the physical clustering of &quot;rrn&quot; operons, contradicting the results of the fluorescence-based study. Therefore, further investigation is required to resolve these contradicting observations. In another example, GalR, forms an interaction network of GalR binding sites that are scattered across the chromosome. GalR is a transcriptional regulator of the galactose regulon composed of genes encoding enzymes for transport and metabolism of the sugar D-galactose. GalR exists in only one to two foci in cells and can self-assemble into large ordered structures. Therefore, it appears that DNA-bound GalR multimerizes to form long-distance interactions.

== Global shape and structure ==

Conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of chemically fixed &quot;E. coli&quot; cells portrayed the nucleoid as an irregularly shaped organelle. However, wide-field fluorescence imaging of live nucleoids in 3D revealed a discrete, ellipsoid shape. The overlay of a phase-contrast image of the cell and the fluorescent image of the nucleoid showed a close juxtaposition only in the radial dimension along its entire length of the nucleoid to the cell periphery. This finding indicates radial confinement of the nucleoid. A detailed examination of the 3D fluorescence image after cross-sectioning perpendicular to its long axis further revealed two global features of the nucleoid: curvature and longitudinal, high-density regions. Examining the chirality of the centerline of the nucleoid by connecting the center of intensity of each cross-section showed that the overall nucleoid shape is curved. The fluorescence intensity distribution in the cross-sections revealed a density substructure, consisting of curved, high-density regions or bundles at the central core, and low-density regions at the periphery. One implication of the radial confinement is that it determines the curved shape of the nucleoid. According to one model, the nucleoid is forced to bend because it is confined into a cylindrical &quot;E. coli&quot; cell whose radius is smaller than its bendable length (persistence length). This model was supported by observations that removal of the cell wall or inhibition of cell wall synthesis increased the radius of the cell and resulted in a concomitant increase in the helical radius and a decrease in the helical pitch in the nucleoid.

=== Nucleoid-membrane connections ===
An expansion force due to DNA-membrane connections appears to function in opposition to condensation forces to maintain an optimal condensation level of the nucleoid. and electron microscopy studies first indicated the possibility of DNA-membrane connections. There are now several known examples of DNA-membrane connections. Transertion is a mechanism of concurrent transcription, translation, and insertion of nascent membrane proteins that forms transient DNA-membrane contacts. Transertion of two membrane proteins LacY and TetA has been demonstrated to cause the repositioning of chromosomal loci toward the membrane. Another mechanism of nucleoid-membrane connections is through a direct contact between membrane-anchored transcription regulators and their target sites in the chromosome. One example of such as transcription regulator in &quot;E. coli&quot; is CadC. CadC contains a periplasmic sensory domain and a cytoplasmic DNA binding domain. Sensing of an acidic environment by its periplasmic sensory domain stimulates DNA binding activity of CadC, which then activates transcription of its target genes. The membrane-localization of genes regulated by a membrane-anchored transcription regulator is yet to be demonstrated. Nonetheless, activation of target genes in the chromosome by these regulators is expected to result in a nucleoid-membrane contact albeit it would be a dynamic contact. Besides these examples, the chromosome is also specifically anchored to the cell membrane through protein-protein interaction between DNA-bound proteins, e.g., SlmA and MatP, and the divisome. Since membrane-protein encoding genes are distributed throughout the genome, dynamic DNA-membrane contacts through transertion can act as a nucleoid expansion force. This expansion force would function in opposition to condensation forces to maintain an optimal condensation level. The formation of highly condensed nucleoids upon the exposure of &quot;E. coli&quot; cells to chloramphenicol, which blocks translation, provides support for the expansion force of transient DNA-membrane contacts formed through transertion. The round shape of overly-condensed nucleoids after chloramphenicol treatment also suggests a role for transertion-mediated DNA-membrane contacts in defining the ellipsoid shape of the nucleoid.

== Visualization ==
The nucleoid can be clearly visualized on an electron micrograph at very high magnification, where, although its appearance may differ, it is clearly visible against the cytosol. Sometimes even strands of what is thought to be DNA are visible. By staining with the Feulgen stain, which specifically stains DNA, the nucleoid can also be seen under a light microscope. The DNA-intercalating stains DAPI and ethidium bromide are widely used for fluorescence microscopy of nucleoids. It has an irregular shape and is found in prokaryotic cells.

== DNA damage and repair ==
Changes in the structure of the nucleoid of bacteria and archaea are observed after exposure to DNA damaging conditions. The nucleoids of the bacteria &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; both become significantly more compact after UV irradiation. Formation of the compact structure in &quot;E. coli&quot; requires RecA activation through specific RecA-DNA interactions. The RecA protein plays a key role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.

Similar to &quot;B. subtilis&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot; above, exposures of the archaean &quot;Haloferax volcanii&quot; to stresses that damage DNA cause compaction and reorganization of the nucleoid. Compaction depends on the Mre11-Rad50 protein complex that catalyzes an early step in homologous recombinational repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. It has been proposed that nucleoid compaction is part of a DNA damage response that accelerates cell recovery by helping DNA repair proteins to locate targets, and by facilitating the search for intact DNA sequences during homologous recombination.

<text>X-Treme Sports was a Canadian English language category 2 television channel owned by Canwest Media Inc., a division of Canwest Global Communications. X-Treme Sports aired a variety of programming primarily related to extreme sports.

==History==
On November 24, 2000 Global Television Network Inc., a subsidiary of Canwest, was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service called &quot;Extreme Sports&quot;, described as &quot;&quot;featuring the best of &quot;off-beat&quot; sports programming that will give Canadians the opportunity to live vicariously through the ultimate high associated with such extreme pastimes as high altitude sky diving, cliff diving, white water rafting, and mountain climbing.&quot;&quot;

The channel launched on September 7, 2001, as X-Treme Sports.

Amid the mid-2000s financial crisis and a mounting debt load, Canwest announced in September 2008 that it would be shuttering X-Treme Sports, with an expected closing date of October 9, 2008. Through its official statement, Canwest cited low growth potential as the reason for its closing of the service, noting funds would be better directed to other channels with greater growth potential. The channel later closed on October 9 as expected.

In December 2010, Leonard Asper, the former CEO of Canwest by that point after the assets were sold to Postmedia and Shaw, acquired Fight Network through his Syngus Corp. holding company via its Anthem Media Group marking the return of sports television ownership.

==Programming==
Programming on X-Treme Sports primarily focused on extreme sports series, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions, lifestyle, and reality programs. Series primarily focused on the sports within the firm definition of extreme sports, such as motocross, mountain biking, surfing, skateboarding, and snowboarding; however, other forms of extreme, adventure and thrill-seeking sports/activities included MMA, professional wrestling, and slamball.

The following list is a sampling of series aired during its last year of operation:

* 360 Surfing
* Crash Bang Wallop
* Crash Stunt Idiots
* Extreme Championship Wrestling
* Fear Factor
* Fusion TV
* IFL Battleground
* IFL Fight Night
* MMX Treme
* Ouch: That Had To Hurt
* Ride Guide Bike 
* World of Wakeboarding
* X-Sport

<text>QTV (Qualification Test Vehicle) was the first test flight of the Apollo Little Joe II rocket. It was launched in August 1963.

==Objectives==
The Little Joe II Qualification Test Vehicle was launched on its first flight from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, Area # 3. The mission objectives were to prove the Little Joe II rocket&#x27;s capability as an Apollo CSM test vehicle and to determine base pressures and heating on the rocket.

==Flight==

Little Joe II QTV was the first flight of the Little Joe II rockets. It was launched from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on August 28, 1963 from Launch Complex 36, Area number 3. The vehicle payload consisted of a simulated command and service module (rather than a boilerplate spacecraft, as used on later test flights) and an inert launch escape system.

Most objectives were achieved. The lone failure was a malfunction in the destruct system.

<doc id="805676" wikidata="Q1367571" url="?curid=805676" title="Esera Tuaolo">
<text>Esera Tavai Tuaolo (born July 11, 1968), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Aloha&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers.

==Football career==
At Oregon State University, Tuaolo was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He won the Morris Trophy in 1989, which is given to the best defensive lineman in the Pac-10. He was named Pac-10 Conference First-team twice and as a senior he was a finalist for the Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy.

Tuaolo then had a successful career as a nose tackle in the NFL for nine seasons, playing for five NFL teams. The Green Bay Packers drafted him in the 1991 NFL draft in the second round as the 35th overall pick. He played 20 games for the Green Bay Packers from 1991 to 1992, was the first rookie in Packer history to start all 16 games in a season, and was a member of the 1991 all-rookie team. Tuaolo then played 60 games for the Minnesota Vikings from 1992 to 1996; 6 games for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1997; 13 games for the Atlanta Falcons in 1998; and 12 games for the Carolina Panthers in 1999. In his 9-year career he recorded 200 tackles, 12 sacks, and 1 interception, and, in 1998, won the NFC Championship with the Atlanta Falcons before losing in the Super Bowl to the Denver Broncos. During that Super Bowl XXXIII, Tuaolo recorded the last tackle of football legend John Elway.

==Music career==
Tuaolo has entertained a singing career during and after football. While with the Packers, for example, Tuaolo once sang the National Anthem in full pads before a game against the Chicago Bears, and then immediately after started in that game. He has since sung the anthem at professional sporting events, from NFL, MLB, NHL, and NBA games to the opening ceremony of the Gay Games VII, a Olympics-style event. He has also released his own music, such as &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;Another Broken Heart&quot; the latter with Lari White, and has performed at various venues and events in the United States and Europe.

===&quot;The Voice&quot;===
In 2017, he auditioned for season 13 of &quot;The Voice&quot; singing &quot;Rise Up&quot; from Andra Day. Two of the four judges, Jennifer Hudson and Blake Shelton turned their chair. Tuaolo chose to be on Team Blake. In the Battle round, he was paired with Team Blake contestant Rebecca Brunner, both singing &quot;This I Promise You&quot; from NSYNC. Coach Shelton chose Tuaolo to go to the Knockouts round.

In the Knockouts, he confronted Adam Cunningham. Tuaolo sang &quot;Superstar&quot; from Delaney &amp; Bonnie made famous by The Carpenters and also famously covered by Luther Vandross. Coach Shelton opted to keep Tuaolo for the playoff round, eliminating Cunningham from his team.

On the Playoffs broadcast on November 13, 2017, he sang &quot;How Do I Live&quot; from LeAnn Rimes. Blake Shelton, being forced to pick only three of his team&#x27;s six finalists, chose to exclude Tuaolo from his final three, thus eliminating Tuaolo from the competition.

==Personal life==
Tuaolo is of Samoan descent. In 2002, having retired from sports in 1999, Tuaolo announced to the public that he is gay, coming out on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports&quot;. This made him the third former NFL player to come out, after David Kopay and Roy Simmons. Another NFL player, Garrison Hearst, made anti-gay comments when he heard the news, but he later apologized.

Tuaolo met his partner, Mitchell Wherley, at a nightclub in 1995, and the couple hid their relationship from the public. Between Tuaolo&#x27;s retirement from the NFL and coming out as gay, he and Wherley adopted twin infants. a boy and a girl. Tuaolo and Wherley&#x27;s relationship ended in 2007.

Since coming out, Tuaolo has been a strong advocate for the LGBT community. He has worked with the NFL to combat homophobia in the league and is a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Athletics Foundation. Tuaolo has testified at the Minnesota state legislature Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in opposition to an anti-gay marriage bill. He makes and has made appearances on various television programs, including &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show,&quot; &quot;The Tyra Banks Show,&quot; &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, to talk about and combat homophobia. Tuaolo&#x27;s current LGBT advocacy primarily involves speaking at colleges and corporations about the pervasiveness of homophobia and helping organizational leaders create a fair and safe environment for their members and employees. Tuaolo was Grand Marshal of the Chicago Pride Parade in 2004.

Tuaolo&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Alone in the Trenches: My Life As a Gay Man in the NFL&quot;, was released in spring 2006. It details Tuaolo&#x27;s upbringing, and sheds light on how his experiences with poverty, sexuality, and football shaped him.

<doc id="805678" wikidata="Q362948" url="?curid=805678" title="James Mancham">
<text>Sir James Richard Marie Mancham KBE (11 August 1939 – 8 January 2017) was a Seychellois politician who founded the Seychelles Democratic Party and was the first President of Seychelles from 1976 to 1977.

==Political career==

James&#x27;s father, Richard Mancham, a successful businessman, sent James to law school in England. When Britain announced its intention to give independence to the colony, Mancham founded the Democratic Party (S.D.P.), and served as its leader until February 2005. France-Albert René founded an opposition party, the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party (S.P.U.P) with the support of the Soviet Union. As Chief Minister of the colony, Mancham promoted tourism to the Seychelles and arranged for the building of the airport that was to make the Seychelles accessible to the rest of the world. Tourism increased and the economy developed. In 1976, he won the popular vote when the British gave the Seychelles independence. Less than a year later, in June 1977, he was deposed in a coup by Prime Minister France-Albert René, who had the support of Tanzanian-trained revolutionaries and Tanzanian-supplied weapons, while Mancham was attending the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.

Mancham lived in exile in London until April 1992. During this period, he was financially successful in several international business ventures and married Catherine Olsen, an Australian journalist working in London. When he returned to the Seychelles following the lifting of the ban on opposition, he resumed the promotion of tourism to the tropical islands.

He ran for president in July 1993 and finished second behind René with 36.72% of the vote. In March 1998, he ran again, receiving third place and 13.8% of the vote, behind René and Wavel Ramkalawan. He was elected Leader of the Opposition from July 1993 to 1998.

==Personal life and death==

Mancham was born into a wealthy family, the eldest son of Richard and Evelyn (née Tirant) Mancham. He had Chinese ancestry through his father and French ancestry through both his father and his mother.

He married Heather Jean Evans in 1963 and the marriage was dissolved in 1974. One daughter named Caroline and one son named Richard were born from the union. In 1985, he married Australian journalist Catherine Olsen and had one son named Alexander.

Mancham died suddenly on 8 January 2017 of a possible stroke at age 77. He was buried in the State House cemetery next to Seychelles&#x27; last French Administrator, Jean-Baptiste Quéau de Quincy.

==Other activity==

Mancham was the author of a number of books, including &quot;Paradise Raped&quot; about the June 1977 coup d&#x27;état in the Seychelles, &quot;War on America: Seen from the Indian Ocean,&quot; written after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, his autobiography; &quot;Seychelles Global Citizen: The Autobiography of the Founding President&quot;, in 2009,; and &quot;Seychelles: The Saga of a Small Nation Navigating the Cross-Currents of a Big World,&quot; in 2015. Mancham also served on the advisory board of &quot;International Journal on World Peace&quot; and was a member of the World Future Council.

==Awards and honours==

Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

Mancham received the 2010 International Jurist Award at the inauguration of the International Conference of Jurists at the Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, India. Under the theme International Terrorism, the event was jointly organised by the International Council of Jurists, the National Human Rights Commission of India, the All India Bar Association and Indian Council of Jurists. In a welcoming speech Dr. Adish Aggarwala, President of the International Council of Jurists and Chairman of All India Bar Association, said the award for Mancham was to recognise his role in promoting world peace and the pivotal part he played in helping to settle international disputes.

Mancham was also one of the recipients of the Gusi Peace Prize in 2011.

<doc id="805700" wikidata="Q1544810" url="?curid=805700" title="Green's identities">
<text>In mathematics, Green&#x27;s identities are a set of three identities in vector calculus relating the bulk with the boundary of a region on which differential operators act. They are named after the mathematician George Green, who discovered Green&#x27;s theorem.

==Green&#x27;s first identity==
This identity is derived from the divergence theorem applied to the vector field while using an extension of the product rule that : Let and be scalar functions defined on some region , and suppose that is twice continuously differentiable, and is once continuously differentiable. Using the product rule above, but letting , integrate over . Then
formula_1
where is the Laplace operator, is the boundary of region , is the outward pointing unit normal to the surface element and is the oriented surface element.

This theorem is a special case of the divergence theorem, and is essentially the higher dimensional equivalent of integration by parts with and the gradient of replacing and .

Note that Green&#x27;s first identity above is a special case of the more general identity derived from the divergence theorem by substituting ,
formula_2

==Green&#x27;s second identity==
If and are both twice continuously differentiable on , and is once continuously differentiable, one may choose to obtain
formula_3

For the special case of all across , then,
formula_4

In the equation above, is the directional derivative of in the direction of the outward pointing surface normal of the surface element ,
formula_5

Explicitly incorporating this definition in the Green&#x27;s second identity with results in
formula_6

In particular, this demonstrates that the Laplacian is a self-adjoint operator in the inner product for functions vanishing on the boundary so that the right hand side of the above identity is zero.

==Green&#x27;s third identity==
Green&#x27;s third identity derives from the second identity by choosing , where the Green&#x27;s function is taken to be a fundamental solution of the Laplace operator, ∆. This means that:
formula_7

For example, in , a solution has the form
formula_8

Green&#x27;s third identity states that if is a function that is twice continuously differentiable on , then
formula_9

A simplification arises if is itself a harmonic function, i.e. a solution to the Laplace equation. Then and the identity simplifies to
formula_10

The second term in the integral above can be eliminated if is chosen to be the Green&#x27;s function that vanishes on the boundary of (Dirichlet boundary condition),
formula_11

This form is used to construct solutions to Dirichlet boundary condition problems. Solutions for Neumann boundary condition problems may also be simplified, though the Divergence theorem applied to the differential equation defining Green&#x27;s functions shows that the Green&#x27;s function cannot integrate to zero on the boundary, and hence cannot vanish on the boundary. See Green&#x27;s functions for the Laplacian or for a detailed argument, with an alternative.

It can be further verified that the above identity also applies when is a solution to the Helmholtz equation or wave equation and is the appropriate Green&#x27;s function. In such a context, this identity is the mathematical expression of the Huygens principle, and leads to Kirchhoff&#x27;s diffraction formula and other approximations.

==On manifolds==
Green&#x27;s identities hold on a Riemannian manifold. In this setting, the first two are
formula_12
where and are smooth real-valued functions on , is the volume form compatible with the metric, formula_13 is the induced volume form on the boundary of , is the outward oriented unit vector field normal to the boundary, and is the Laplacian.

==Green&#x27;s vector identity==
Green&#x27;s second identity establishes a relationship between second and (the divergence of) first order derivatives of two scalar functions. In differential form
formula_14
where and are two arbitrary twice continuously differentiable scalar fields. This identity is of great importance in physics because continuity equations can thus be established for scalar fields such as mass or energy.

In vector diffraction theory, two versions of Green&#x27;s second identity are introduced.

One variant invokes the divergence of a cross product and states a relationship in terms of the curl-curl of the field
formula_15

This equation can be written in terms of the Laplacians,

formula_16

However, the terms
formula_17
could not be readily written in terms of a divergence.

The other approach introduces bi-vectors, this formulation requires a dyadic Green function. The derivation presented here avoids these problems.

Consider that the scalar fields in Green&#x27;s second identity are the Cartesian components of vector fields, i.e.,
formula_18

Summing up the equation for each component, we obtain
formula_19

The LHS according to the definition of the dot product may be written in vector form as
formula_20

The RHS is a bit more awkward to express in terms of vector operators. Due to the distributivity of the divergence operator over addition, the sum of the divergence is equal to the divergence of the sum, i.e.,
formula_21

Recall the vector identity for the gradient of a dot product,
formula_22
which, written out in vector components is given by

formula_23

This result is similar to what we wish to evince in vector terms &#x27;except&#x27; for the minus sign. Since the differential operators in each term act either over one vector (say formula_24’s) or the other (formula_25’s), the contribution to each term must be
formula_26
formula_27

These results can be rigorously proven to be correct through evaluation of the vector components. Therefore, the RHS can be written in vector form as

formula_28

Putting together these two results, a result analogous to Green&#x27;s theorem for scalar fields is obtained,
Theorem for vector fields: formula_29

The curl of a cross product can be written as
formula_30

Green&#x27;s vector identity can then be rewritten as
formula_31

Since the divergence of a curl is zero, the third term vanishes to yield Green&#x27;s vector identity:
formula_32

With a similar procedure, the Laplacian of the dot product can be expressed in terms of the Laplacians of the factors
formula_33

As a corollary, the awkward terms can now be written in terms of a divergence by comparison with the vector Green equation,
formula_34

This result can be verified by expanding the divergence of a scalar times a vector on the RHS.

<doc id="805705" wikidata="Q8074085" url="?curid=805705" title="Zoobomb">
<text>Zoobomb is a weekly bicycling activity in Portland, Oregon, United States during which participants ride bicycles rapidly downhill in the city&#x27;s West Hills. Zoobomb began in 2002.
Participants carry their bikes on MAX Light Rail to the Washington Park station next to the Oregon Zoo. From there, participants take the elevator to the surface and then ride their bikes down the hills in the vicinity. This process is often repeated several times throughout the night.

==Culture==
There is an emphasis on unusual bicycles, first and foremost the children&#x27;s bicycles or &quot;minibikes,&quot; but extending to tall bikes, swing bikes, choppers, non-functional bicycles, skateboards, longboards, etc.
The Zoobombers are made up of a wide demographic, with a tendency towards young adults. The event is treated in a very lighthearted fashion, including a large amount of socializing between rides. Riders often dress up in costume or decorate their bicycles. Parents have brought their children on rides, and a legally blind person &quot;The Blind Bomber&quot; regularly attends (on a tandem bike, behind a sighted rider). Though not technically a race, there is some prestige in getting down the hill first. However, there is never shame in getting down the hill last, as safety and fun are what is encouraged, not going fast. The participants espouse a &quot;pack it in, pack it out/leave no trace&quot; philosophy in an effort to maintain cleanliness in the areas where they congregate. Zoobomb tries to be a positive force in the community by providing a safe environment to have a good time and to support bicycle advocacy and alternative non-polluting transportation.

==Zoobomb Pile==


Though many riders bring their own bicycles, the participants maintain a &quot;Zoobomb pile&quot;. This is a tower of minibikes anchored to a bicycle rack at the Zoobomb meeting point. These are spare bikes that are used as loaners for would-be Zoobombers who don&#x27;t have their own bike. The pile has become a local landmark.

In March 2009, a new pile was dedicated, in a ceremony attended by Portland mayor Sam Adams. The new pile is located at SW 13th and Burnside.

==Related events==
There are several annual events hosted by Zoobomb organizers and participants, including:
*Zoobomb Century in June
*MiniBikeWinter in February
*Zoobomb Summer Olympics (aka BiffDay) in August
*Alleykitten Invitational

Zoobomb has inspired Hoodbomb, where participants gather at the Timberline Lodge and bomb the course of Timberline Road on Mount Hood.

<text>WHDH (channel 7) is an independent television station in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is owned by Sunbeam Television alongside Cambridge-licensed CW affiliate WLVI (channel 56). WHDH and WLVI share studios at Bulfinch Place (near Bowdoin Square and Government Center) in downtown Boston; through a channel sharing agreement, the two stations transmit using WHDH&#x27;s spectrum from the WHDH-TV tower in Newton, Massachusetts.

From 1982 to 1995, WHDH was Boston&#x27;s CBS affiliate, inheriting the affiliation from its predecessor on channel 7, WNAC-TV. On January 2, 1995, WHDH switched to NBC, after CBS moved to WBZ-TV (channel 4) by virtue of a group-wide affiliation deal with its owner, Westinghouse Broadcasting (CBS and Westinghouse merged that November, making WBZ-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station). On January 1, 2017, after losing NBC&#x27;s affiliation to a newly formed owned-and-operated station, WBTS-LD (channel 8, now Telemundo O&amp;O WYCN-LD in Providence, Rhode Island), WHDH became a news-intensive independent station.

==History==
===WNAC-TV&#x27;s fight for survival and transition (1948–1982)===

The original occupant of the channel 7 allocation in Boston was WNAC-TV, which commenced operations on June 21, 1948, as Boston&#x27;s second commercial station. Originally a CBS affiliate, the station switched to ABC in 1961, but rejoined CBS in 1972.

By 1965, WNAC-TV&#x27;s owner, RKO General, faced numerous investigations into its business and financial practices. Though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) renewed WNAC-TV&#x27;s license in 1969, RKO General lost the license in 1981 after its parent company, General Tire, admitted to a litany of corporate misconduct—which among other things, included the admission that General Tire had committed financial fraud over illegal political contributions and bribes—as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, in the FCC hearings, RKO General had withheld evidence of General Tire&#x27;s misconduct, and had also failed to disclose evidence of accounting errors on its own part. In light of RKO&#x27;s dishonesty, the FCC stripped RKO of the Boston license and the licenses for KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) in Los Angeles and WOR-TV in New York City (now WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey). The FCC had previously conditioned renewal of the latter two stations&#x27; licenses on WNAC-TV&#x27;s renewal. An appeals court partially reversed the ruling, finding that RKO&#x27;s dishonesty alone merited having the WNAC-TV license removed. However, it held that the FCC had overreached in tying the other two license renewals to WNAC-TV&#x27;s renewal, and ordered new hearings.

Though RKO continued to appeal the decision, in late February 1982 the FCC granted the New England Television Corporation (NETV, a merger of two of the original rivals to the station&#x27;s license controlled by Boston grocery magnate David Mugar) a construction permit to build a new station on channel 7. Two months later in April, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear RKO&#x27;s appeal, leaving the firm with no further recourse but to accept the Commission&#x27;s decision and surrender WNAC-TV&#x27;s license. RKO then sold the station&#x27;s non-license physical assets, including its studio on Bulfinch Place and transmitter/tower site in suburban Newton, to NETV. RKO General formally surrendered the WNAC-TV license at midnight on May 21, 1982; the station signed off as WNAC-TV for the final time about an hour later.

===As WNEV-TV (1982–1990)===
NETV took over channel 7 nearly five hours later under a new license, signing on the new WNEV-TV at 5:55 a.m. ET that morning (however, the present WHDH does claim WNAC&#x27;s previous history as its own; a similar situation exists locally with the present-day WCVB and the original WHDH). Behind the imaging theme &quot;There&#x27;s a New Day Dawning&quot;, WNEV-TV dropped WNAC-TV&#x27;s strip-layered &quot;7&quot; logo in favor of a new stylized &quot;SE7EN&quot; logo. However, the new station inherited WNAC-TV&#x27;s CBS affiliation and syndicated program contracts, and most of the former WNAC-TV staff—including news reporter and anchor Mike Taibbi, who signed the station on the air in a brief ceremony prior to WNEV-TV&#x27;s first program, CBS&#x27; &quot;Summer Semester&quot;.

NETV&#x27;s mission from the start was to allocate programming hours to innovative, in-house productions, in much the same way that Boston Broadcasters did when it launched WCVB-TV on channel 5 ten years earlier. Notable productions that premiered early on were &quot;Look&quot; (1982–1984), which began as a two-hour (4 p.m. to 6 p.m.) late afternoon talk and lifestyle show that led into WNEV&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast. Despite a powerful effort at an entertaining and informative program, and praise from critics, &quot;Look&quot; was a ratings failure; for its second year, the show was cut back to an hour and renamed &quot;New England Afternoon&quot; before being dropped. WNEV continued to produce talk programs, first with &quot;Morning/Live&quot; (1984–1987), a half-hour weekday morning talk show hosted by Susan Sikora, and later with the similarly structured &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; (1988), hosted by Matt Lauer. Nancy Merrill, former host of WBZ-TV&#x27;s &quot;People Are Talking&quot;, headlined two talk shows on WNEV, the weekend late night entry &quot;Merrill at Midnight&quot; (1986–87) and the weekday morning program &quot;Nancy Merrill&quot; (1987–88).

NETV also made it an immediate purpose to further diversify the station&#x27;s workforce, both on-air and behind the scenes. Within WNEV&#x27;s first couple of years, there was an increase of news reporters and anchors of color joining the station (notably including anchor Lester Strong and reporter Amalia Barreda). The commitment to diversity extended itself to a series of new public affairs shows that each targeted a specific ethnic group: &quot;Urban Update&quot; (with an African-American focus and which still continues to air on WHDH), &quot;Revista Hispana&quot;, &quot;Asian Focus&quot; and &quot;Jewish Perspective&quot;. Other public affairs and newsmagazines launched by WNEV included a Sunday morning religious affairs program, &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, the weekend talk and advice show &quot;Boston Common&quot;, the Saturday night newsmagazine &quot;Our Times&quot;, and &quot;Studio 7&quot;, which focused on the arts.

In 1987, another of WNEV&#x27;s ambitious efforts premiered, the hour-long live children&#x27;s variety show &quot;Ready to Go&quot;. Featuring Broadway actress/singer Liz Callaway and Scott Reese, who not only hosted but also sang and acted, the program featured an equal mix of entertainment and educational content, along with musical acts and celebrity interviews. The series began as a 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. programming alternative against WBZ and WCVB&#x27;s morning newscasts, before moving to 7 a.m. in September 1989. On March 24, 1990, after only six months at its new time slot, the station cut the series back to once-a-week Saturday broadcasts only, before canceling the show outright in 1991.

In mid-August 1987, WNEV overhauled its on-air image. The station dropped its &quot;SE7EN&quot; identity in favor of a new logo, which consisted of the number &quot;7&quot; made up of seven white dots inside of a blue circle. The logo was introduced as a part of the new station-wide campaign, &quot;We&#x27;re All on the Same Team&quot;, in which the seven dots represented the heads of team members. The dots also had dual usage, as lottery balls, in promotions for &quot;Lottery Live&quot;, the Massachusetts State Lottery drawings which were moving to WNEV late that summer. The campaign was primarily launched as a continued attempt to bolster the station&#x27;s third-place news ratings, and to promote its news-sharing partnership with other TV and radio stations, The New England News Exchange.

===WHDH radio (1990–1992)===
Throughout the 1980s, WNEV-TV frequently partnered with WHDH radio (850 AM, now WEEI) for public events such as Project Bread and the Walk For Hunger, as well as for other initiatives. NETV would eventually purchase WHDH on August 7, 1989. In January 1990, Mugar announced that on March 12 of that year, WNEV would change its call letters to WHDH-TV, in order to correspond with its sister radio operation. The WHDH-TV call sign was previously used by the original occupant of channel 5, under the ownership of the &quot;Boston Herald-Traveler&quot;, from 1957 to 1972. It was Mugar&#x27;s plan to create, once again, a second major television/radio duopoly, primarily in news, to compete with the long-standing combo of WBZ radio and WBZ-TV. Boston Mayor Ray Flynn declared March 12, 1990, as &quot;WHDH Day&quot; in Boston, celebrating the joining of the radio and television stations. On that day, personalities from WHDH-TV spoke as guests on WHDH radio.

The dual operation, which began with much fanfare and leverage, proved to be too costly for Mugar and company. NETV gradually slid into a deficit, prompting cutbacks on in-house programming as well as in the television station&#x27;s news department; the most notable effect being the elimination of WHDH-TV&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast for two years beginning in 1991. With channel 7&#x27;s news ratings in third place, minimal help from CBS (which had been in a ratings slump since the end of the 1987–88 television season) and declining profits, Mugar was eventually prompted to sell the WHDH stations. The radio station was sold to Atlantic Ventures in 1992.

===Sale to Sunbeam===
By 1991, the relationship between majority owner David Mugar and minority owner Robert Kraft had become strained. Kraft, who became owner of the New England Patriots in 1994, exercised an option that forced Mugar to purchase his shares for an estimated $25 million. This, along with the nearly $100 million debt he held from the 1986 buyout and falling advertising revenues left Mugar strapped for cash. On April 22, 1993, David Mugar entered into an agreement to sell WHDH to Miami-based Sunbeam Television, a company led by Worcester native Edmund Ansin. The purchase was completed in late July.

Shortly afterward, Ansin brought in news director Joel Cheatwood from his Miami flagship station WSVN. Cheatwood had become infamous in Miami for his changes to WSVN&#x27;s news operation, which focused on visually intensive, fast-paced newscasts with heavy emphasis on tabloid journalism, particularly covering crime (WSVN—which was an NBC affiliate from its 1956 sign-on until it joined Fox in 1989—adopted the format developed by Cheatwood in order to buoy viewership for its newscasts, which like WHDH, had languished in third place for several years). Cheatwood planned to perform similar changes at WHDH. Cheatwood ultimately adopted a considerably watered-down version of WSVN&#x27;s format (see below), but still retained many of WSVN&#x27;s features, including a faster-paced format, increased use of graphics and visuals, and more on-the-scene reporting. It even adopted WSVN&#x27;s version of the Circle 7 logo. While critics were concerned that WHDH would lose even more viewers if it were to adopt WSVN&#x27;s format entirely, WHDH quickly rebounded to become the number one newscast in Boston for a period.

===As an NBC affiliate (1995–2017)===
In 1994, WBZ-TV&#x27;s owner, Westinghouse Broadcasting entered into a groupwide affiliation deal with CBS, which resulted in three Group W stations that were affiliated with networks other than CBS—NBC affiliates WBZ-TV, and KYW-TV in Philadelphia, and ABC affiliate WJZ-TV in Baltimore—switching to the network. Fox, already associated with Sunbeam through its affiliation with WSVN, considered an affiliation deal with WHDH (even before the Group W announcement, channel 7 had reportedly been considering dropping CBS for Fox); however, on August 2, 1994, WHDH-TV announced that it had agreed to affiliate with NBC instead of Fox, in part citing NBC&#x27;s stronger news and sports programming. Fox ultimately chose to acquire its existing affiliate, WFXT (channel 25). WHDH became Boston&#x27;s NBC affiliate on January 2, 1995, replacing WBZ-TV (which had been with the network for 46 years). The final CBS program to air on channel 7 was the made-for-TV movie &quot;A Father for Charlie&quot; at 9 p.m. Eastern Time on January 1, 1995.

During its time with NBC, channel 7 cleared the network&#x27;s entire programming schedule (an exception was the network&#x27;s early morning newscast at the time of the switch, &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;, which ended on September 6, 1999; its successor, &quot;Early Today&quot;, was carried by WHDH for the remainder of its NBC affiliation). Between 1996 and 1997, WHDH produced a mid-morning weekday newsmagazine for the NBC network called &quot;Real Life&quot;. After the switch to NBC, WHDH became one of the few stations in the country to have had a primary affiliation with all of the Big Three networks. On September 14, 2006, Tribune Broadcasting sold CW affiliate WLVI-TV (channel 56) to Sunbeam Television for $117.3 million. The sale was approved by the FCC in late November of that year, creating Boston&#x27;s second television duopoly (the other one being WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV, channel 38). WLVI moved its operations from its Dorchester studios to WHDH&#x27;s facilities in downtown Boston.

On April 2, 2009, WHDH announced that it would not air &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, when it debuted on NBC in September 2009, electing to replace it with a simulcast of the 10 p.m. newscast that WHDH began producing for WLVI in order to better compete with Fox affiliate WFXT. The network quickly dismissed any move of &quot;Leno&quot; to any time slot other than 10 p.m., stating that WHDH&#x27;s plan was a &quot;flagrant&quot; violation of the station&#x27;s contract with the network and that it would consider moving the NBC affiliation to another Boston area station, either by creating an owned-and-operated station through an &quot;existing broadcast license&quot; in the market owned by NBC or by seeking inquiries from other stations in the market to acquire the affiliation. WHDH began removing all references to the proposed 10 p.m. newscast from its website the next day, and on April 13, 2009, the station announced that it had decided to comply and air &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; instead.

The fears of possible ratings issues with the prime time talk show as the lead-in for its late newscast would become well-realized, as viewership for WHDH&#x27;s 11 p.m. news plunged to third place (a 20% drop from the previous year) during the November 2009 sweeps period. Other &#x27;first-to-last&#x27; drops among NBC affiliates&#x27; newscasts in the 11 p.m. slot and overall affiliate pressure forced the network on January 10, 2010, to pull &quot;Leno&quot; from 10 p.m. starting after the 2010 Winter Olympics and move him back to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in a controversial shake-up of its late night schedule. Although the radio station had dropped the WHDH callsign in 1994, channel 7 retained the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix in its call letters until July 8, 2010.

===Loss of NBC affiliation===
It was reported on August 31, 2015, that NBC Owned Television Stations was considering the possibility of purchasing WHDH; NBCUniversal already had a strong presence in the market through its ownership of New England Cable News (NECN), CSN New England, and Telemundo station WNEU (channel 60), while WHDH&#x27;s NBC affiliation was set to expire at the end of 2016. Meredith Corporation and Nexstar Broadcasting Group were also reportedly interested in purchasing the station. NBCUniversal and Sunbeam denied these rumors. Sunbeam&#x27;s Executive Vice President and former WHDH general manager Chris Wayland, stated that the company &quot;fully [expects]&quot; that it would renew WHDH&#x27;s affiliation. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted a history of hostility between NBC and Sunbeam, including its objection to NBC&#x27;s late-1980s purchase of WTVJ in Miami to displace its own WSVN (which later defected to Fox), and the aforementioned conflicts surrounding &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. On October 1, 2015, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that NBC had considered moving the affiliation to NECN, a cable channel, rather than to an over-the-air channel, although the company declined to comment.

On December 15, 2015, &quot;New England One&quot; reported, citing internal sources, that NBCUniversal had declined to renew its affiliation with WHDH, and was beginning the process of building an English-language news operation at WNEU for its assumption of the affiliation. It also reported that WHDH meteorologist Pete Bouchard, who had left the station around the same time, had been poached by NBC for WNEU. Following the report, Paul Magnes, WHDH&#x27;s vice president and general manager, told the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; that the station still expected the NBC affiliation to be renewed.

Sunbeam owner Ed Ansin subsequently confirmed to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that NBC had informed him in September 2015, that channel 7&#x27;s affiliation would not be renewed, and offered to buy the station for $200 million; however, he said that he would not consider any offers worth less than $500 million, and that any sale of WHDH would also include WLVI. Ansin said that NBC was &quot;trying to steal our station&quot;, and confirmed that the network was threatening to shift its programming to WNEU, but that he still predicted that WHDH would retain its NBC affiliation. Ansin believed that NBCUniversal&#x27;s main motivation for these moves were to create further synergies with WNEU and New England Cable News for the purposes of advertising sales. Initial reports suggested that if WHDH were to lose NBC programming, Sunbeam would move the CW affiliation currently held by WLVI to channel 7. However, Ansin subsequently stated that WHDH would be operated as a news-intensive independent station if the NBC affiliation was lost; additionally, WLVI&#x27;s own affiliation with The CW (a ten-year agreement made in 2006 with then-owner Tribune Broadcasting) was up for renewal in August 2016, and there was a possibility that CBS (who, along with Time Warner, at the time had co-ownership of The CW) could transfer the CW affiliation to WSBK-TV (then-affiliated with MyNetworkTV) if WLVI was unable to renew.

On January 7, 2016, Valari Staab, president of NBC Owned Television Stations, confirmed that NBC would cease its affiliation with WHDH effective January 1, 2017, and that it would launch its owned-and-operated NBC outlet &quot;NBC Boston&quot; that day. Staab did not outright say whether NBC programming would be carried by WNEU, but that NBCUniversal was evaluating options for over-the-air carriage of the new outlet. Prior to the announcement, Ansin told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that he was considering challenging the planned move of NBC from WHDH, arguing that the proposed move would be in violation of conditions imposed by the FCC upon Comcast&#x27;s acquisition of NBC Universal, as the company agreed to maintain the over-the-air availability of NBC, and not use its cable holdings to influence affiliation deals. His position was supported by Senator Edward Markey; a representative of Markey stated that as a &quot;long-time supporter of universal service and free, over-the-air local broadcasting&quot;, he planned to &quot;closely scrutinize the impacts any deal could have on viewers in Massachusetts&quot;.

On March 10, 2016, Sunbeam Television sued Comcast in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, citing violations of antitrust law and the conditions which Comcast agreed to upon its purchase of NBC Universal. Sunbeam argued that because WNEU&#x27;s over-the-air signal radius covers four million fewer residents than WHDH, over-the-air viewers in these areas would have to purchase pay television service in order to maintain access to NBC programming—which would benefit Comcast&#x27;s cable business. Sunbeam also asserted that moving NBC to a company-owned station would &quot;[enable] Comcast to increase its monopoly power in the Boston television market, and the resulting decrease in competition will harm consumers, advertisers and other broadcasters&quot;. On May 16, 2016, the court granted a request of Comcast to dismiss the lawsuit, Judge Richard Stearn stated the loss of over-the-air coverage &quot;may be a matter of public concern, [but] it is not a concern that WHDH has standing to redress&quot;, and that &quot;absent any actionable harm attributable to Comcast, it is simply an indurate consequence of doing business in a competitive and unsentimental marketplace&quot;. WHDH intended to appeal the dismissal, and filed a notice of appeal on June 14, 2016; in a statement, Ansin said that the station believed &quot;the judge got it all wrong, so we are reviewing our options for an appeal&quot;.

On August 16, 2016, Ansin announced that he would no longer pursue the appeal against NBC, arguing that it was unlikely that the appeal would be resolved in his favor. Consequentially, the station officially announced a planned expansion of its news programming, including an expanded morning newscast and a prime time block of news spanning from 9 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., and that the 8 p.m. hour would be filled by syndicated programming. However, station lawyer Michael Gass told the &quot;Boston Business Journal&quot; that channel 7 was still pursuing the appeal, saying that &quot;[t]hey have to prepare to be a non-affiliate and have a plan for doing that even though we continue to believe that Comcast did not honor its obligations to us&quot;, while conceding that it was unlikely that a court would force NBC to remain on WHDH.

On November 1, 2016, NBCUniversal announced that it planned to simulcast &quot;NBC Boston&quot; on both WNEU&#x27;s second digital subchannel and on WBTS-LD (now WYCN-LD), the former WTMU-LP purchased by NBC the previous September. Initially, NBC also leased a subchannel of WMFP to help provide full-market coverage. This agreement ended in 2018 when NBC purchased Nashua, New Hampshire-licensed WYCN-CD (now WBTS-CD), to channel share with full-power PBS member station WGBX-TV, which transmits from Needham. WHDH&#x27;s affiliation formally ended at 3 a.m. ET on January 1, 2017. The final NBC program aired on channel 7 was &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve with Carson Daly&quot;, which began on December 31, 2016, at 11:30 p.m.

==Programming==
===Preempted programming===
As a CBS affiliate, the station preempted programming in moderation, in favor of more locally produced shows. From 1989 to 1990, the station delayed the first hour of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; in favor of the children&#x27;s show &quot;Ready To Go&quot;. In February 1994, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; was dropped and picked up by WABU (channel 68, now WBPX-TV). WHDH then began airing an expanded local morning newscast.

===Special events===
On July 4, 2018, WHDH began to simulcast the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular yearly with Bloomberg Television, returning the event to local television after a one-year absence. It also broadcast &quot;A Boston Pops Salute to Our Heroes&quot;, which was produced in lieu of the 2020 edition of the event due to its cancellation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Lottery===
WNEV/WHDH had exclusive rights to &quot;Lottery Live&quot;, broadcasting the Massachusetts State Lottery games six nights a week from August 31, 1987, to March 6, 1994. Motivated to cultivate an identity to the station that would indirectly help its last-place news ratings, WNEV acquired the lottery from WBZ-TV, which had announced late in 1986 that it would no longer show the games. The arrival of the lottery games was promoted heavily, and went hand-in-hand with the station&#x27;s on-air image change that fall; the new dotted-7 logo that was adopted during that time had a dual meaning, in that the dots were to represent lottery balls.

A contest was held by WNEV in August 1987, just under a month before the games moved to the station, to scout for their own lottery host (Tom Bergeron, who hosted &quot;Lottery Live&quot; on WBZ-TV, did not continue in the role because he remained at that station in other capacities). The auditions were held in front of an audience of 200 at Boston&#x27;s Westin Hotel at Copley Place, in which the finalists were narrowed down to 16. The winner was Lynn-Andrea Waugh, familiarly known as &quot;Andi&quot;, a 29-year-old red-haired model who had no prior on-air experience. Despite being well received by viewers due to her effervescent personality and striking good looks, Ms. Waugh never completely overcame her noticeable nervousness after taking to the air. Waugh abandoned her hosting spot upon the expiration of her contract in August 1988. She was replaced with Dawn Hayes, who had been the runner-up in the lottery host competition. Hayes, who was equally as appealing but with a polished, confident on-air presence, began her long run as host during this era.

During &quot;Lottery Live&quot;″s entire run on channel 7, the daily &quot;Numbers Game&quot; drawing aired at 7:52 p.m. (following the conclusion of the &quot;Double Jeopardy!&quot; round of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;), while the specialty game of the evening (e.g., &quot;Mass Ca$h&quot;) originally aired during the CBS prime time lineup at 9:50 p.m. (retaining the airtime the specialty games had on WBZ). From 1991 until the end of channel 7&#x27;s lottery contract in 1994, the specialty games were moved down to a 7:58 p.m. airtime, following the closing credits of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. Weekend lottery hosts during the channel 7 era included Linda Ward, Linda Frantangela (both prior to 1993) and Jill Stark (1993–94), who all substituted on weekdays as well when Hayes was absent. WNEV/WHDH also aired prime time game show specials produced by the Massachusetts State Lottery, usually a few times a year, that were broadcast either from the station&#x27;s studios at 7 Bulfinch Place or at other public venues across Boston.

The lottery commission saw tremendous growth during this period, increasing its sales to record highs, promoting further advertising and expanding its game roster (&quot;Mass Ca$h&quot;, which launched in 1991, was added to the already successful lineup of &quot;The Numbers Game&quot; and specialty games &quot;Megabuck$&quot; and &quot;Mass Millions&quot;). Channel 7&#x27;s nightly broadcasts of &quot;Lottery Live&quot; and the periodic sweepstakes specials were integral in fielding this success for the lottery; this, combined with &quot;Lottery Live&quot; pulling in high ratings as a part of the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;/&quot;Jeopardy!&quot; hour, which ranked first place in 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. prime access, caused the station to renew the lottery contract for another three years in 1990. After the sale to Sunbeam in 1993, WHDH&#x27;s contract with the lottery was not renewed, despite continued success on the station. Lottery rights were subsequently picked up by WCVB, which began airing the nightly drawings on March 7, 1994. The &quot;Lottery Live&quot; format moved to its third consecutive station, with Dawn Hayes being retained as host by WCVB.

===Sports programming===
WHDH became the primary station for the New England Patriots in 1995, as the Patriots played in the American Football Conference of the NFL, which had a deal with NBC for the network to air AFC games (thus Boston was not as important a market for Fox in regard to getting a VHF affiliate). When the AFC package moved to CBS in 1998, this role was reclaimed by WBZ-TV. From 2006 to 2016, the station aired Patriots games when they were featured on &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; (the station aired the Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl XLIX victory in 2015 and their Super Bowl XLVI appearance in 2012). Also, WHDH aired selected Red Sox games from 1990 to 1993 as a CBS station via that network&#x27;s MLB over-the-air broadcast contract, and again through NBC&#x27;s limited rights to MLB&#x27;s postseason from 1995 to 2000. WNEV/WHDH has also aired Boston Celtics games, first via CBS&#x27; broadcast contract with the NBA from 1982 to 1990 (continuing what WNAC-TV had aired since 1973; their NBA Finals victories in 1984 and 1986 were aired on WNEV), and again through NBC from 1995 to 2002. From 2006 to 2016, the station also aired Boston Bruins games via the &quot;NHL on NBC&quot;, including their victory in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.

Between 1992 and 2016, WHDH aired a total of twelve Olympic Games; the first two events in 1992 and 1994 were aired while the station was affiliated with CBS, with the remaining ten games airing while the station was affiliated with NBC (WBZ-TV aired its last Olympic broadcast in 1998).

In 2025, WHDH reached an agreement to air four Boston Red Sox spring training games during the 2025 season. The games will stream on NESN 360.

===News operation===

WHDH presently broadcasts 73½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week, with 12 hours each weekday, 6½ hours on Saturdays, and seven hours on Sundays. In regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the fourth-highest newscast output of any broadcast television station in the entire United States, behind Los Angeles CW owned-and-operated station KTLA (channel 5), which broadcasts 94 hours, 20 minutes of local newscasts per week; Indianapolis CW affiliate WISH-TV (channel 8), which broadcasts 76 hours of locally produced newscasts and programs each week; and Phoenix independent KTVK (channel 3), which broadcasts 74 hours of local newscasts per week. In addition, the station produces &quot;Urban Update&quot;, a discussion program focusing on issues affecting the area&#x27;s Black community, and &quot;Honda Sports Xtra&quot;, a weekly half-hour sports highlight program. The station operates a Bell LongRanger 206L news helicopter entitled &quot;Sky 7&quot;. The station&#x27;s weather radar is presented on-air as &quot;Storm Scan Doppler&quot; with a signal coming from the radar at the National Weather Service local forecast office in Taunton.

====Media partnerships====
The station, in partnership with MetroNetworks, launched the TrafficTracker truck during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Boston. With traffic reporter Marshall Hook behind the wheel of one of the station&#x27;s live vehicles, WHDH became the only station in the market to produce live traffic reports from the road. The station continues to use the TrafficTracker during snowstorms, including the December 13, 2007, storm that resulted in paralyzing commutes that, in some cases, exceeded seven hours.

The station maintains NBC-era resource coverage agreements with other regional stations. WHDH shares its resources with WJAR, the NBC affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island, for news coverage of southeastern Massachusetts. WWLP, the NBC affiliate in Springfield, shares its resources with WHDH for news coverage of western areas of the state.

====News department history====
=====1982–1993=====
WNAC-TV had spent the better part of its history as the lowest-rated major-network affiliate in Boston, and one of the weakest large-market CBS affiliates in the country. When New England Television began operating the station, it embarked on a massive attempt to bring channel 7 out of the ratings basement. David Mugar and company soon announced the infamous &quot;dream team&quot; of newscasters, headed by Tom Ellis and Robin Young. Ellis had previously maintained WBZ-TV&#x27;s dominance in the news market, and then helped WCVB reach #1 in the ratings during his tenure there from 1978 to 1982. Young, on the other hand, had no hard news experience but was well-known to Boston viewers as former co-host of &quot;Evening Magazine&quot;. The new partnership, as well as the completely restructured news department as a whole, received heavy promotion in the months leading to the official launch of the finalized WNEV news product (accompanied by a launch image campaign, &quot;There&#x27;s A New Day Dawning&quot;). The newsroom facility, built feverishly over the summer of 1982, was cited by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; as being the most technologically advanced out of all three network stations in the market. There was considerable reporting on the high salaries (a total of roughly $1 million a year) the new station was offering Ellis and Young. On the night of Ellis and Young&#x27;s debut, September 13, 1982, WNEV beat WCVB and WBZ in the evening news ratings. The curiosity of Boston viewers only lasted a week in large numbers; the following week, channel 7 crumbled back to a distant third.

WNEV&#x27;s news department underwent more shakeups, both in talent and identity, due to ongoing sagging ratings. WNEV&#x27;s inaugural station manager, Winthrop &quot;Win&quot; Baker, and his news director Bill Applegate were both fired in May 1983. Replacing Baker was former WBZ-TV programming head Sy Yanoff, whom Mugar had the utmost confidence in given his track record at channel 4 (both Ellis and Young had worked for Yanoff at separate times, years earlier, at channel 4; this was a major factor in him taking the job). Yanoff quickly brought former WBZ-TV news director Jeff Rosser to the same post at channel 7, with a five-year contract. Over the summer, the two fired quite a few of the 1982 &quot;dream team&quot; hires, in an effort to strengthen and better utilize the talents that worked. The largest issue they faced was the public perception that Young and Ellis were a mismatched anchor team. Young, whose informal presence began to contrast severely with the seriousness of Ellis, was offered new avenues at WNEV by Yanoff so that the station could boast a more balanced, serious lead anchor team. Although she had stated in the spring of 1983 that she was at the anchor desk for the long haul, Young made a move with Yanoff and Mugar that July which granted her airtime on WNEV for prime time specials produced through her private production company, Young Visions. Young decided that leaving the news department would allow her more time to focus on these specials, as well as the availability to be an all-purpose station personality.

During that summer, as Young geared up to vacate her anchor position, Yanoff and Rosser named four possible successors, including KNXT reporter Terry Murphy (later of &quot;Hard Copy&quot; fame) and WNEV&#x27;s own reporter Diane Willis, who had been among the station&#x27;s new hires the previous year. Willis was selected for the position in early September, and began anchoring with Tom Ellis that same month. Young, meanwhile, went on to host her prime time specials and events until 1987.

In the spring of 1984, NETV moved its on-air news look away from the changes made only two years prior, taking away the anchoring desk from the newsroom and utilizing a backdrop allowing chroma keys and CGI graphics to be placed. WNEV also began a network of regional news bureaus known as the &quot;New England News Exchange&quot;, in which WNEV consulted with other stations (such as WCSH-TV in Portland, WLBZ-TV in Bangor, WFSB in Hartford, WLNE-TV in Providence and WMUR-TV in Manchester) and print media throughout the region to create a high-powered electronic news gathering organization. Despite a continued massive influx of capital and marketing (including a highly financed promotional campaign employing the refrain &quot;Feel Good About That&quot;), and more positive reviews of the station&#x27;s newscasts following the appointment of Willis as lead anchor, WNEV still failed to take the competition by storm.

In the spring of 1986, Yanoff and Rosser announced that they would try a second lead anchor team for the weeknight 11 p.m. newscasts in the fall. They planned to keep Ellis and Willis on at 6 p.m., while giving the 11 p.m. slot to weekend anchor/reporter Kate Sullivan and Dave Wright, an incoming newsman hired away from ATV in the Canadian Maritimes. However, when Rosser had a meeting with Willis for what was supposed to be her contract renewal, he was told by her that instead, she would be leaving to become a professor of journalism at Northeastern University. Willis and Rosser publicly announced her resignation in July, and Willis assured the staff that her decision to leave WNEV was isolated from her soon-to-be decreased air time. Ellis, on the other hand, was unhappy about his reduction, feeling that he was no longer being considered the station&#x27;s principal anchor. Yanoff and Rosser attempted to come to agreeable terms with Ellis, with two proposed plans—to either pair him with Kate Sullivan or Dave Wright, or to find him another replacement female anchor. It was purported that WNEV was even in discussions with by-then-former NBC anchor Linda Ellerbee for her to become Ellis&#x27; co-anchor. The anchor replacement and Wright-Ellis pairing ideas were ultimately nixed (by the 1980s, the idea of two men anchoring together was passe), with Sullivan and Wright taking over both the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts in September. Ellis was demoted to reporter, a move that ultimately led to his exit from the station altogether in early December 1986.

In August 1987, numerous changes occurred when R.D. Sahl, who had been WNEV&#x27;s noon anchor on weekdays, joined Kate Sullivan as her new partner on weeknights (Sahl had filled in for Wright on numerous occasions during 1986 and 1987, and heavily in the summer of 1987 when Wright was recovering from a heart attack). At the same time, WNEV became the first Boston station to launch a 5 p.m. newscast, which was anchored by Dave Wright and Diana Williams. The &quot;Live at Five&quot; hour of the news was a cross between the informality of WBZ&#x27;s competing &quot;Live on 4&quot; and WNEV&#x27;s regular newscasts, without the lifestyle and specialty features seen on &quot;Live on 4&quot;. However, there was a unique twist. Wright, who had created the &quot;Live at Five&quot; format at ATV (where he had hosted it from 1982 to 1986), brought the concept to WNEV, which had him and Williams walking around a special newsroom set sans an anchor desk as they presented stories. Featured reporters were seated at assignment desks on the set, as they contributed to the fray and chatted with Wright and Williams. The format soared in the ratings, a true accomplishment long labored by NETV. Ultimately, the news program&#x27;s producers started feuding, and Wright, who felt caught in the middle, resigned from WNEV in May 1988. Just prior to Wright&#x27;s departure, Jeff Rosser had left the station at the close of his contract, and arriving in his place was former WCVB news director Jim Thistle. By September 1988, the &quot;Live at Five&quot; format was dropped (as it remained the intellectual property of ATV), and the 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. block was restructured as a more conventional newscast, anchored by Williams and Lester Strong. After Williams departed for WABC-TV in 1990 (where she remains to this day), Strong anchored with new arrival Edye Tarbox in the 5 p.m. hour.
Besides the locally prominent journalists who attempted to leverage WNEV&#x27;s news, a few future national talents had brief stints at the station in the 1980s. Bill O&#x27;Reilly, long before his national exposure on &quot;Inside Edition&quot; and Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, co-anchored &quot;NEWSE7EN Weekend&quot; in 1982–83. Soon after, O&#x27;Reilly also became the host of the station&#x27;s weekday afternoon talk/lifestyle program, &quot;New England Afternoon&quot; (which replaced the ill-fated two-hour magazine show &quot;Look&quot;, canceled after its first season). His successor on the weekend newscast was Paula Zahn, since a newswoman of many television networks, who co-anchored with Lester Strong from 1983 to 1985. Rehema Ellis, who joined the station in 1985 as a general assignment reporter, eventually left to become an NBC News national correspondent in 1994. From May to November 1988, future &quot;Today&quot; host Matt Lauer hosted WNEV&#x27;s mid-morning talk show &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;. Two more WNEV/WHDH alumni would then hit the big time: reporter Miles O&#x27;Brien, a 1987 arrival to the station, left to join CNN in 1989. Edye Tarbox, now E.D. Hill, who was an anchor/reporter at WHDH from 1990 to 1992, later worked at Fox News Channel from 1999 to 2008.

Tom Ellis, who had been dethroned of the male lead anchor position at the station in 1986, came full circle when &quot;Inside Edition Extra&quot;, a companion series to the syndicated program &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, appeared on WHDH&#x27;s fall 1992 daytime schedule. Ellis had been named the host of &quot;IE Extra&quot;, which was a co-production of WHDH-TV and King World Productions; Ellis, thus, was employed by Boston&#x27;s channel 7 yet again, albeit for the national show. &quot;IE Extra&quot;, which was broadcast from the same New York City studio as &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, and aired in most markets after its parent series as part of an hour-long &quot;IE&quot; block (WHDH aired the shows back-to-back at 4 p.m.). Ellis also appeared following his former WNEV colleague, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who had been anchoring &quot;Inside Edition&quot; since 1989. The scheduling only lasted a year, as &quot;Inside Edition Extra&quot; was canceled at the end of the 1992–93 season. This program has no relation to the current &quot;Extra&quot;, a Warner Bros.-produced entertainment magazine that premiered in the fall of 1994, and has aired on WHDH since 1999.

=====1993–present=====
There were abrupt changes when Sunbeam bought the station in 1993. New station owner Ed Ansin brought Joel Cheatwood, the creator of WSVN&#x27;s fast-paced news format, to Boston. Cheatwood introduced a considerably watered-down version of the WSVN format. However, it was still shocking by Boston standards. Prior to the debut of the new format and &quot;7 News&quot; identity that November, Ansin and Cheatwood began changing anchor lineups: in mid October 1993, Margie Reedy was moved from the main evening newscasts to the Noon and 5:30 p.m. newscasts. Rehema Ellis was promoted to female lead anchor (at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.) with R.D. Sahl. However, many of the crew&#x27;s doubts about the new, impending tabloid style were realized once the format switch was off and running.

More changes were in store concerning the look of the newscasts. Compared to the previous look of WHDH, which used soft, varied colors, both the default &quot;dotted 7&quot; logo and a more colorful version, a light theme (&quot;Advantage&quot; by Frank Gari, originally commissioned for WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut), and announcer Chris Clausen; WHDH&#x27;s new look was far different, incorporating dark blue, red, black, and silver. The &quot;dotted 7&quot; logo was succeeded by WSVN&#x27;s version of the &quot;circle 7&quot; logo. The graphics initially used a &quot;diagonal stripe&quot; theme, soon after these graphics were replaced with a new set which incorporated glass panels. The theme (&quot;7 News&quot;, composed by Chris Crane, who has made various news themes that have been used by WSVN since 1991) was also quite different, made up of dissonant, droning synth chords. The music evolved in later years, incorporating the NBC chimes, as well as a more orchestral sound. The set was also steadily integrated into the newsroom, much like WSVN&#x27;s had been (taking a cue from CNN); the resulting set/newsroom hybrid was, like at WSVN, dubbed the &quot;Newsplex&quot;. It continues, and has been gradually updated over the years to reflect the graphical and technological updates done by the station. Chris Clausen was replaced by Scott Chapin, who was the announcer for WSVN since 1988; he continued to announce for both stations until January 2, 2011, when he was replaced by Paul Turner. Chapin returned to WHDH on December 29, 2014, three years after he was replaced. A similar format was adopted by KJRH-TV in Tulsa, Oklahoma between 1994 and 1997.

Most of the station&#x27;s prominent newscasters wanted nothing to do with Cheatwood (who had a reputation as a pioneer in tabloid television). Ellis was one of the first to leave WHDH in response to Ansin&#x27;s changes. Only two months into her promotion to lead anchor, Ellis declared herself a free agent, quickly accepting an offer at NBC News as a national correspondent. She signed off from WHDH shortly after Christmas and began at NBC on January 1, 1994. R.D. Sahl was then sole anchor of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, with fill-in anchors from other station positions joining him periodically. In January 1994, the station reinstated a weekday morning newscast, which NETV had cut a few years earlier due to the financial constraints. Sunbeam hired two new anchors, Kim Khazei and Gerry Grant, to helm the broadcast, titled &quot;7 News Morning Edition&quot;. Originally airing from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m., the newscast expanded by an additional two hours to 9 a.m. when WHDH dropped the low-rated &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; in late February. At the same time, Sunbeam restored the 5 p.m. newscast cut by NETV.

During this time, Sahl became quite vocal of his displeasure with the new tabloid format, and it was clear that he was looking for a way out of his contract as well. Cheatwood soon hired Kim Carrigan, a transplant from Des Moines, Iowa, who first appeared as female lead anchor alongside Sahl in April 1994. Sunbeam was confident that Carrigan, the 31-year-old newcomer, and the 46-year-old Sahl, by now a trusted Boston news veteran, would be the lasting lead anchor team for them, but in late July 1994, Sahl met with his legal counsel and came to an agreement over the termination of his WHDH contract. Sahl made his final appearance on &quot;7 News&quot; in early August. Carrigan, who was quickly gaining a following, then continued on alone for several weeks at a time for the next four months. This made her the first female newscaster in Boston to anchor alone in the key 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m. time periods. At times during the fall of 1994, Carrigan would be joined by a rotation of male co-anchors, including Lester Strong, Gerry Grant, and Jonathan Hall; however, promotions for these newscasts during this time featured Carrigan as sole anchor. Margie Reedy, meanwhile, remained on the noon and 5 p.m. newscasts until her departure that December. Both Sahl and Reedy would join NECN soon afterward, where (save for Sahl&#x27;s short-lived stint at KCAL-TV in Los Angeles) they would remain for several years afterward.

When WHDH switched to NBC in January 1995, the morning newscast was scaled back to the traditional 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. timeslot in order to accommodate &quot;Today&quot;; a few months later, it was renamed from &quot;7 News Morning Edition&quot; to the current &quot;Today in New England&quot;. Later in January, as a result of a package deal WHDH had signed the previous fall, the station saw the arrival of husband-and-wife anchors John Marler and Cathy Marshall. Marler, a longtime anchor at WAGA-TV in Atlanta, joined Kim Carrigan at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m. Marshall, who had been a CNN anchor, was originally unclear as to what her role with &quot;7 News&quot; would be, but ultimately became Margie Reedy&#x27;s replacement at Noon and the 5 p.m. hour, beside Lester Strong. These two anchoring teams remained in place for the next three years. Gerry Grant departed from the morning newscast in February 1995 to join the reporting staff of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;; he was replaced that April by Alison Gilman. Former WBZ-TV anchor Randy Price, who had joined WHDH in 1996, first as a freelance reporter and then as a weekday morning anchor (taking over from the departing Gilman in February 1997), replaced Marler at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m. in August 1998.

Channel 7, which for several years had already begun a tradition of scheduling news in (previously) untraditional time periods, broke further ground again with the addition of a half-hour 4 p.m. newscast in June 1996, which gave Strong and Marshall additional anchor duties. The newscast was launched when WHDH sought an alternative to its previous efforts to program the 4 p.m. time slot (including &quot;Inside Edition&quot; through the end of the 1993–94 season, &quot;A Current Affair&quot; from September 1994 to January 1996 and finally, the WSVN-produced &quot;Deco Drive&quot;, the latter two programs of which had underperformed for the station). The 4 p.m. newscast was originally separated from the existing early evening news block by &quot;Hard Copy&quot;, and later by &quot;Extra&quot; after &quot;Hard Copy&quot; ended its run in September 1999; after &quot;Extra&quot; moved to 7:30 p.m. in September 2001, WHDH launched a 4:30 p.m. newscast (the second in Boston, after a newscast on WFXT that launched three months earlier).

The fast-paced Sunbeam news format rejuvenated WHDH&#x27;s ratings, especially after switching to NBC. For most of the last decade, WHDH has waged a spirited battle for first place, behind long-dominant WCVB. In 2002, WHDH was noted as having the best newscast in the U.S. in a study published by the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;. In previous studies, the station was deemed as having one of the worst newscasts. On December 19, 2006, WHDH took over production of WLVI&#x27;s nightly 10 p.m. newscast (after Sunbeam&#x27;s purchase of the station resulted in the shutdown of channel 56&#x27;s in-house news department). On February 29, 2008, it was reported that the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike caused a significant loss in viewers for the station&#x27;s late newscast. WHDH-TV finished at 11 p.m., with an average of 166,100 total viewers, down from 199,900 viewers in 2007.

From 1997 to 2003, WHDH&#x27;s staff included field reporter Jeffery Derderian, who was a co-owner of The Station nightclub with his brother Michael. Jeffrey resigned from WHDH in February 2003 to join WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island. Three days later, a fire engulfed the Station nightclub, killing 100 people.

On July 29, 2008, WHDH became the second station in Boston (after WCVB-TV) to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. On that day, revised graphics, music, and an updated newsplex also made their debut. During the transition, the station&#x27;s newscasts were conducted in front of a green screen showing the former newsplex while renovations to that set were being done. On August 22, 2011, WHDH launched an hour-long 9 a.m. newscast, which replaced &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; after it moved from WHDH to WCVB-TV. Originally slated to premiere on September 12, 2011, the launch date of the newscast was moved up three weeks to August 22, 2011. &quot;Live&quot;, which had aired on the station since it premiered nationally in 1988, moved to WCVB on the latter date, airing directly opposite the WHDH newscast.

Following the station&#x27;s decision on August 16, 2016, to drop its objection to the loss of the NBC affiliation at the end of the year, WHDH announced that it would add additional local newscasts; following this expansion, channel 7 would broadcast over 87 hours of newscasts a week. The expansion led to the hiring of 30 new staffers. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that the station would also introduce a new news set in September 2016.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
Digital subchannel 7.2 originally carried NBC Weather Plus starting in May 2006, until NBC discontinued the network in November 2008. On February 2, 2009, WHDH-DT2 began carrying programming from This TV. Via digital cable, channel 7.2 is offered on Comcast channel 936 and Verizon FiOS channel 460.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WHDH shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7 on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 42 to VHF channel 7.

Because of a large number of complaints regarding the inability of viewers to receive over-the-air programming on channel 7, WHDH requested and received temporary authority from the FCC on June 16, 2009, to simulcast its programming on UHF channel 42, in addition to VHF channel 7. Although stations in other major markets have similar problems, WHDH is the only station in the Boston area market which changed its digital channel due to the June 2009 transition, requiring a channel map rescan to receive the station. WHDH was also one of three area stations, along with WMUR-TV (channel 9) and WWDP (channel 46), to broadcast in VHF post-transition, requiring either a traditional indoor antenna within Boston proper, or in outer areas at minimum an outdoor antenna.

On September 15, 2009, the FCC issued a &quot;Report &amp; Order&quot;, approving WHDH&#x27;s move from channel 7 to channel 42. After the station filed its minor change application for a construction permit, stating the channel move, on November 9, 2009, WHDH terminated operations on VHF channel 7 and now permanently operates solely on channel 42 (mapping to virtual channel 7 via PSIP). The equipment for the channel 7 digital transmitter was shipped to Miami for use by sister station WSVN, which continues to broadcast on VHF 7 with few complaints due to South Florida&#x27;s less-varied terrain. On June 1, 2010, WHDH filed an application to operate at the power level of 1 million watts. The application was approved on December 14, 2010.

The station shifted to physical channel 35 in the late-2010s spectrum allocation, with Sunbeam selling WLVI&#x27;s spectrum and placing that station in a channel sharing agreement with WHDH, which started on January 8, 2018, with the move to 35 occurring in 2019.

==Coverage in Canada==
WHDH was one of six Boston area television stations that is carried on Canadian satellite provider Bell Satellite TV and was authorized as an American over-the-air station eligible for national distribution. It was also available via the Anik F1 satellite to several Canadian cable providers, particularly in Atlantic Canada. Other cable systems also carried WHDH, such as Citizens Cable Television in the Thousand Islands region of New York State and Bermuda CableVision.

WYCN-LD (as WBTS-LD) was authorized to provide NBC service over Canadian pay-TV on December 20, 2016. Most providers carrying WHDH, including Bell Canada-owned providers and Eastlink, replaced it with WBTS effective January 1, 2017, coinciding with end of WHDH&#x27;s NBC affiliation; despite this, , WHDH remains on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)&#x27;s list of eligible non-Canadian services and stations that can be distributed in the country.

<doc id="805729" wikidata="Q737706" url="?curid=805729" title="Sébastien Vaillant">
<text>Sébastien Vaillant (; May 26, 1669 – May 20, 1722) was a French botanist who was born at Vigny in present-day Val d&#x27;Oise.

== Early years ==
Vaillant went to school at the age of four and by the age of five, he was collecting plants and transplanting them into his father&#x27;s garden. At the age of six, he was sent to a boarding school at Pontoise. He suffered with a fever for four months which he claims to have cured using lettuce seasoned with vinegar.

He was sent to study with the organist of the Pontoise Cathedral. When the organist died, Vaillant succeeded him at the age of eleven.

Vaillant studied medicine and surgery at the hospital in Pontoise (medicine then included studies in botany). He left Pontoise for Évreux at the age of nineteen. He was at the battle of Fleurus in 1690 as a surgeon. While still a surgeon in 1691, he was in Paris when he took as his master of botany Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656–1708). Tournefort used Vaillant&#x27;s talents while writing (&quot;History of the plants that are born around Paris&quot;), published in 1698. Vaillant also took lessons in anatomy with Joseph-Guichard Du Verney and chemistry with Antoine de Saint-Yon.

== Botanist ==
Guy-Crescent Fagon, the king&#x27;s physician and botanist, noticed Sébastien Vaillant and made him his secretary. Vaillant was therefore able to devote himself to the study of plants for which he obtained unlimited access to the Royal Garden. Fagon appointed him director. Fagon himself was a teacher and sub-demonstrator at the Royal Garden. 

The garden collections grew considerably under the leadership of Vaillant. Even though Vaillant himself was based in Paris and is remembered for his work on the Parisian flora, the garden had several contributors outside Paris, in particular in the colonies.

Fagon obtained from Louis XIV an authorization to build a &quot;Cabinet of drugs&quot; in the Royal Garden and charged Vaillant to furnish it and to provide security.

Charles Bouvard had the first greenhouse built: the Garden had plants from hot countries, and in 1714 Vaillant obtained the authorization to build another one.

He became ill and too poor to publish his (alphabetically or Enumeration of plants that grow in and around Paris) illustrated by Claude Aubriet. A fruit of 36 years of work, he left his work at Herman Boerhaave&#x27;s home, . The work contained engraved illustrations and was published in 1727. It is a work of particular importance in the history of botany and one of the first to describe the flora known. Vaillant introduced the terms of stamen, ovary, and egg in their current direction.

All his life, Vaillant opposed the theses of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. As a mark of respect Carl von Linné named a genus Valantia after Vaillant in the Rubiaceae.

His herbarium is now kept at the National Museum of Natural History, France.

<doc id="805735" wikidata="Q3515" url="?curid=805735" title="Rabeprazole">
<text>Rabeprazole, sold under the brand name Aciphex, among others, is a medication that decreases stomach acid. It is used to treat peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and excess stomach acid production such as in Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It may also be used in combination with other medications to treat &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;. Effectiveness is similar to other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include constipation, feeling weak, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects may include osteoporosis, low blood magnesium, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach.
Rabeprazole was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Rabeprazole, like other proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, is used for the purposes of gastric acid suppression. This effect is beneficial for the treatment and prevention of conditions in which gastric acid directly worsens symptoms, such as duodenal and gastric ulcers. In the setting of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), whose pathophysiology is characterized by prolonged exposure to gastric acid in the esophagus (often due to changes in stomach and/or esophagus anatomy, such as those induced by abdominal obesity), acid suppression can provide symptomatic relief. Acid suppression is also useful when gastric production of acid is increased, including rare conditions with excess gastric acid secretion (hypersecretory conditions) like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), and systemic mastocytosis. In an open-label, industry-sponsored, non-controlled study of high-dose rabeprazole for the treatment of ZES and idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion (IGAH), including patients with MEN-1 and GERD, rabeprazole induced and maintained suppression of basal acid output over a 24 month period. Only one patient withdrew from the study due to an elevation in creatine phosphokinase judged to be possibly due to rabeprazole, while rabeprazole was otherwise well-tolerated in this population. There are no clinical trials to date that have studied the precise use of rabeprazole, or any PPI, for the treatment of acid-related complaints due to systemic mastocytosis, but acid suppressing medications such as PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists are routinely used to counter the histamine-mediated acid secretion found in this disorder.

Rabeprazole is also useful alongside antibiotic therapy for the treatment of the pathogen &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, which otherwise thrives in acidic environments. In the original studies that gave rise to its approval for the eradication of &quot;H. pylori&quot;, rabeprazole was studied in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin. This triple therapy was studied at the specific doses of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, which is a higher dose of rabeprazole than what is used for the treatment of simple GERD (20 mg once daily). The higher dose is thought to provide more consistent elevation of pH in the stomach, leading to better eradication of &quot;H. pylori&quot;, congruent with the dosing strategies of other PPIs for this indication. Notably, &quot;H. pylori&quot; eradication with antibiotics and rabeprazole was also shown to prevent development of second in a in high-risk patients with early stomach cancer treated by .

Thus, rabeprazole is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of symptomatic GERD in adolescents and adults, healing duodenal ulcers in adults, eradication of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, and pathologic hypersecretory conditions.

===Available forms===
Rabeprazole is available in 10 and 20 mg, delayed-release tablets (pictured below). Rabeprazole-based products, like other proton pump inhibitor products, have to be formulated in delayed-release tablets to protect the active medication from being degraded by the acid of the stomach before being absorbed.

===Specific populations===
====Pediatrics====
Rabeprazole&#x27;s only pediatric indication is for the treatment of symptomatic GERD in adolescents (12 years-old and up).

====Pregnancy====
The FDA originally labeled rabeprazole as a pregnancy category B drug (meaning that in vivo research failed to demonstrate a fetal hazard, though human studies are lacking), but it was reclassified as a pregnancy category C drug (meaning that in vivo research &quot;has&quot; shown a fetal hazard, though the benefit of use may outweigh the risk) in 2014. This was after the publishing of an in vivo study that detected changes in bone morphology in rats treated with esomeprazole. In these rats, the following observations were noted:

* shortened femurs, decreased width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate, and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity occurred at doses equal to or greater than 3.4 times the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD);
* decreased survival, decreased birth weight, and an increase in neurobehavioral delays occurred at doses equal to or greater than 16.8 times the daily MRHD;
* physeal dysplasia of the femur occurred at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times the daily MRHD.

In vivo studies on rabbits with rabeprazole doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day (about 13 times the normal human drug exposure of rabeprazole at 20 mg) failed to show evidence of fetal harm.

====Lactation====
It is expected that rabeprazole will be secreted into human breast milk, though the clinical impact of this is still unknown. Avoiding rabeprazole during breastfeeding confers to lowest possible risk.

====Geriatrics====
Advanced age does not appear to clinically impact rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolism. However, elevations in the maximum plasma concentration and the total drug exposure (area under the curve, AUC) have occurred.

====Japanese ancestry====
In a study on rabeprazole&#x27;s pharmacokinetics, the AUC was elevated by approximately 50–60% in men of Japanese ancestry compared to men in the United States. See the pharmacogenetics section below for a pharmacogenetic explanation of these findings.

====Kidney or liver problems====
In people that have kidney or liver problems, these problems do not appear to affect rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolism in a clinically meaningful way. This includes individuals on dialysis for kidney problems. Severe liver problems like cirrhosis of the liver do affect rabeprazole&#x27;s elimination half-life, but not to a degree of dangerous accumulation. In a review of patients taking rabeprazole while having end-stage kidney disease and mild-to-moderate severity, chronic compensated cirrhosis of the liver, the alteration in rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolism was not clinically meaningful.

==Contraindications==
Rabeprazole is contraindicated in the following populations and situations:
* people with a known hypersensitivity to rabeprazole, substituted benzimidazoles (which are chemically similar to rabeprazole, like omeprazole), or any other component of the capsule formulation (e.g. certain dyes)
* concurrent use of rilpivirine, a medication used to treat HIV infection

===Hypersensitivity===
====Syndrome====
An allergy to a PPI like rabeprazole may take the form of type I hypersensitivity or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. A selective (pattern C—see below for a discussion of cross-reactivity patterns) type I hypersensitivity reaction to rabeprazole resulting in anaphylaxis has been reported, as well as several whole group hypersentivities.

====Cross-reactivity====
Hypersensitivity to PPIs can take the form of whole group hypersensitivity, pattern A, B, or C. Whole group hypersentivity occurs when a person is cross-reactive to all PPIs; that is, all PPIs will induce the allergy. In pattern A, a person may be allergic to omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole, but not to lansoprazole and rabeprazole. This is thought to be due to the structural similarities between omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole, contrasted with lansoprazole and rabeprazole. Pattern B is the opposite, reflecting people that are allergic to lansoprazole and rabeprazole, but not to omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole. Pattern C, in the context of rabeprazole, would reflect a person that is allergic to only rabeprazole, but not to other PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole).

===Rilpivirine===
Rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in the treatment of HIV, is contraindicated with all PPIs because of their acid-suppressing effect. PPIs suppress acid, thereby raising the pH of (alkalizing) the stomach&#x27;s contents. Rilpivirine is best absorbed under acidic conditions. Therefore, rabeprazole would be expected to decrease the absorption of rilpivirine, decrease the concentration of rilpivirine in the blood, and possibly lead to therapeutic failure and induce resistance of the HIV virus to rilpivirine and/or cross-resistance with other NNRTIs.

==Adverse effects==
In general, rabeprazole is fairly well tolerated, even with up to five years of continuous use (the duration of follow-up in a pharmacovigilance clinical trial). The side effect profile is similar to that of omeprazole. The side effect profile is similar to that of omeprazole and other commonly used PPIs. The most common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Rare side effects include rashes, flu-like symptoms, and infections (including by the gastrointestinal pathogen &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;). Rare instances of rabeprazole-induced liver injury (also known as hepatotoxicity) have been reported. Characteristic proton-pump inhibitor hepatotoxicity occurs within the first 4 weeks of starting the medication.

Gastrin is an endogenous human hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion and regulating the growth of certain cells in the stomach. Enterochromafin-like (ECL) cells, responsible for stimulating gastric acid secretion by the release of histamine in the stomach, respond to prolonged gastrin exposure by growing and proliferating. Rabeprazole is associated with elevated serum gastrin levels (hypergastrinemia), which occurs through inhibiting the negative feedback of stomach acid on gastrin secretion by G cells in the antrum of the stomach. The elevation in serum gastrin levels are thought to be dependent upon the degree of rabeprazole&#x27;s CYP2C19 metabolism. Rabeprazole is not as significantly metabolized by CYP2C19 compared to other medications in the same class, like omeprazole. Hypergastrinemia has been posited as a potential source of rabeprazole-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. dizziness, numbness, and tremor), though more research is needed to clarify the effect and mechanism.

Prolonged elevated serum gastrin has been shown to cause rat ECL cells to form carcinoid tumors. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of observational studies, the use of acid-suppressing drugs (including PPIs like rabeprazole, but also histamine receptor 2 antagonists) may be associated with the development of gastric cancer. The studies included in the meta-analysis did not differentiate between rabeprazole and other PPIs, so it is unclear if the potential risk may differ across the PPI class.

Acid suppression via rabeprazole can decrease the absorption of vitamin B12 and magnesium, leading to deficiency. A case of rabeprazole-induced iron deficiency anemia has been reported. Theoretically, rabeprazole could induce an iron deficiency anemia by reducing the dietary absorption of iron, which requires acid for bioavailability.

Very serious side effects have been reported in people taking rabeprazole, but there is no direct evidence that rabeprazole definitely caused these side effects. These include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a serious disease characterized by skin rash and risk of organ failure), serious blood cell abnormalities, coma, and death. Other possible side effects, common to other PPI medications in the same class, include bone fractures due to osteoporosis, serious infections (including &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;), and kidney damage (nephrotoxicity). A rare, though less understood, side effect of the PPI class is the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome of striated muscle destruction.

=== Osteoporosis and fractures ===
The mechanism of PPI-induced osteoporosis and fractures is unclear, but hypotheses include hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, hyperparathyroidism, and B12 deficiency (inducing neurological deficits and subsequent falls). In opposition to the calcium malabsorption hypothesis, rabeprazole prevented reductions in bone mineral density akin to the effect of minodronic acid in a study of gastrectomized rats. Midodronic acid is a bisphosphonate class drug used to prevent fractures in osteoporosis. Unlike midodronic acid, rabeprazole did not affect serum calcium levels, although the attenuation of gastrectomy-induced bone mineral density reduction at the distal end of the femur suggested inhibition of bone resorption by osteoclasts (like a bisphosphonate).

=== Infection risk ===
PPIs have been associated with an increased risk for pneumonia by meta-analyses of case-control and cohort studies. One hypothesis for this association is that PPI-induced acid suppression fosters the growth of aerobic bacteria in the stomach, which can be transferred to the lungs by microaspiration, promoting colonization and subsequent pneumonia. Other hypotheses include off-target proton pump inhibition in the lungs, altering the pH of pulmonary mucus in favor of bacterial growth, and direct inhibition of the activity of white blood cells such as neutrophils and natural killer cells. In line with the stomach acid suppression hypothesis for bacterial overgrowth, PPIs have also been associated with &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infections. However, as these meta-analyses have pooled PPIs together, it is unknown whether the risk of infection differs significantly between rabeprazole and other members of the PPI class. Rabeprazole was identified as the causative agent in a case report of collagenous colitis, inducing chronic, watery diarrhea.

Other enteric, infectious organisms associated with PPI use include &quot;Campylobacter&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Both pathogens are sensitive to acid; theoretically, as above, acid suppression by PPIs should increase their pathogenicity. It is unclear if the observed association is due to the PPI itself, as one cohort study found that the association could be explained by the demographic factors of patients prescribed PPIs (e.g. concurrent use of immunosuppressant medications, older age, and antibiotic use). In a clinical trial of 255 Japanese patients, the incidence of PPI-associated diarrhea did not differ between rabeprazole, omeprazole, or lansoprazole.

=== Nephrotoxicity ===
Forms of kidney damage associated with PPIs in one meta-analysis include acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) (insufficient quality evidence), acute kidney injury (AKI) (low grade evidence), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (low grade evidence), and end-stage renal disease (insufficient quality evidence). The first reported case of rabeprazole-induced acute interstital nephritis occurred in a 62 year-old female in Australia, prescribed rabeprazole for complaints of dyspepsia due to suspected GERD. The mechanism for PPI-induced acute interstital nephritis has not been elucidated, though an immune-related hypothesis has been posited on the basis of extra-renal toxicity consistent with an immunologic, hypersensitivity reaction. It has also been posited that incomplete resolution of PPI-induced acute interstitial nephritis could precede acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

=== Muscle-related adverse events ===
Cases of progressive muscle weakness, muscle pain, and rhabdomyolysis following administration of PPIs have been reported in the scientific literature. However, the mechanism for these muscle-related adverse events has yet to be established. In one case, rhabdomyolysis developed in a 50 year-old patient 2 weeks after starting both rabeprazole and domperidone, a prokinetic and antiemetic agent, which resolved after discontinuation of both drugs. Per the French imputability method of causality assessment, it was determined that rabeprazole was a &quot;plausible&quot; cause of the rhabdomyolysis, noting that domperidone was started concurrently.

==Overdose==
No signs and symptoms have been reported in overdoses of rabeprazole up to 80 mg, but case examples are limited. Notably, rabeprazole has been used in higher doses for the treatment of hypersecretory conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (up to 120 mg daily).

Animal experiments with ultra-high doses of rabeprazole have demonstrated lethality through unknown mechanisms. The lethal overdose syndrome in animals is characterized by convulsion and coma.

== Interactions ==

===Drug-drug interactions===
Rabeprazole does not interfere with the plasma concentration of drugs that are also metabolized by the same enzymes (i.e. CYP2C19) that it is metabolized by. Therefore, it is not expected to react with CYP2C19 substrates like theophylline, warfarin, diazepam, and phenytoin. However, the acid-suppression effects of rabeprazole, like other PPIs, may interfere with the absorption of drugs that require acid, such as ketoconazole and digoxin.

There is some evidence that omeprazole and esomeprazole, two medications in the same class as rabeprazole, can disturb the conversion of an anticoagulant medication called clopidogrel to its active metabolite. However, because this is thought to be mediated by the effect of omeprazole and esomeprazole on CYP2C19, the enzyme that activates clopidogrel, this drug interaction is not expected to occur as strongly with rabeprazole. However, whether the effect of omeprazole and esomeprazole on clopidogrel&#x27;s metabolism actually leads to poor clinical outcomes is still a matter of intense debate among healthcare professionals.

Clinically serious drug-drug interactions may involve the acid-suppression effects of rabeprazole. For example, rabeprazole should not be used concomitantly with rilpivirine, an anti-HIV therapy, which requires acid for absorption. Lowered plasma concentrations of rilpivirine could lead to progression of HIV infection. Other drugs that require acid for absorption include antifungal drugs like ketoconazole and itraconazole, digoxin, iron, mycophenolate, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors like erlotinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. There is no clinically relevant drug interaction between rabeprazole and antacids.

===Food-drug interactions===
Food does not affect the amount of rabeprazole that enters the body, but it does delay its onset of effect by about 1.7 hours.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Once rabeprazole is taken by mouth, the enteric coating of the tablet allows the drug to pass through the stomach intact. Like other PPIs, rabeprazole is absorbed into the blood stream at the site of the proximal small bowel. Rabeprazole&#x27;s mechanism of action involves crossing from the blood stream into the parietal cells of the stomach, which are the cells that are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid (HCl). At this point, rabeprazole is inactive. However, rabeprazole is then secreted into the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cells, which is the space from which acid secretion occurs. Here, acid secretion is mediated by the energy-dependent acid pumps, called hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) pumps. These enzymatic pumps have cysteine amino acid residues. After being activated by gastric (stomach) acid to a reactive sulfenamide intermediate, rabeprazole permanently binds the cysteine residues, forming covalent, disulfide bonds. This action fundamentally alters the configuration of the acid pump, thereby inhibiting its activity. Thus, acid can no longer be secreted into the gastric lumen (the empty space of the stomach), and the pH of the stomach increases (decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions, H+). Due to the permanent inhibition of the individual proton pump that each molecule of rabeprazole has bound to, acid secretion is effectively suppressed until new proton pumps are produced by the parietal cells.

Rabeprazole, like other medications in the same class, cannot inhibit the H+/K+ ATPase pumps found in lysosomes, a cellular organelle that degrades biological molecules, because the pumps found in these organelles lack the cysteine residues involved in rabeprazole&#x27;s mechanism of action.

A unique feature of rabeprazole&#x27;s mechanism of action in inhibiting acid secretion involves its activation. The pKa (the pH at which 50% of the drug becomes positively charged) of rabeprazole is around 5.0, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of acid to activate it. While this theoretically translates into a faster onset of action for rabeprazole&#x27;s acid-inhibiting effect, the clinical implications of this fact have yet to be elucidated. Theoretically, a high pKa should correlate with off-target activation of the PPI (possibly inducing side effects), though the clinical relevance of this has also yet to be elucidated. See Table 1 for a pKa comparison across PPIs.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Rabeprazole&#x27;s bioavailability is approximately 52%, meaning that 52% of orally administered dose is expected to enter systemic circulation (the bloodstream). Once in the blood, rabeprazole is approximately 96.3%-97% bound to plasma proteins. The biological half-life of rabeprazole in humans is approximately one hour. It takes about 3.5 hours for rabeprazole to reach the maximum concentration in human plasma after a single orally administered dose. Oral absorption is independent of the dose administered.

Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized by the liver. 90% of the drug is rendered into metabolites by the liver, which are then excreted by the kidneys. 10% of the dose is excreted in the feces. The drug metabolizing enzymes primarily responsible for rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolism are CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. However, rabeprazole is mainly metabolized through non-enzymatic reduction to a thioether metabolite. Some of rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolites include the following: a thioether carboxylic acid metabolite, a thioether glucuronide metabolite, and a sulfone metabolite. The most common metabolites excreted in the urine are the mercapturic acid conjugate and carboxylic acid. A diagram of rabeprazole&#x27;s phase I metabolism is shown below.

===Pharmacogenetics===
The effect of rabeprazole may vary based upon the genetics of the individual taking the medication. People may have differences in their capacity to metabolize rabeprazole to an inactive metabolite. This may be mediated through genetic differences in the gene that encodes for the metabolic enzyme CYP2C19. For example, people that are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers (i.e. their version of CYP2C19 is less effective than average) will have trouble metabolizing rabeprazole, allowing the active rabeprazole to stay in the body, where it can exert its effect, longer than intended. Conversely, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers (i.e. the average metabolic capacity of CYP2C19) will extensively metabolize rabeprazole, as expected. The poor metabolizing CYP2C19 phenotype is found in roughly 3–5% of Caucasian people, and in 17–20% of people of Asian ancestry. In a study on men of Japanese ancestry, this has translated to an average increase of total drug exposure by 50–60% compared to men in the United States.

However, rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolism is primarily non-enzymatic (it is often inactivated chemically, without the participation of the body&#x27;s natural drug metabolizing enzymes). Therefore, while a person&#x27;s CYP2C19 phenotype will affect rabeprazole&#x27;s metabolism, it is not expected to dramatically affect the efficacy of the medication.

==Chemistry==

Rabeprazole is classified as a substituted benzimidazole, like omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole. Rabeprazole possess properties of both acids and bases, making it an amphotere. The acid dissociation constant (pKa) of the pyridine nitrogen is about equal to 4.

===Synthesis===

The above synthesis pathway begins with 2,3-dimethypyridine &quot;N&quot;-oxide (1). Nitration of 2,3-dimethylpyridine &quot;N&quot;-oxide affords the nitro derivative (the addition of NO2) (2) The newly introduced nitro group is then displaced by the alkoxide from 3-methoxypropanol to yield the corresponding ether (3). Treatment with acetic anhydride results in the Polonovski reaction. Saponification followed by treatment with thionyl chloride then chlorinates the primary alcohol (5). Reaction with benzimidazole-2-thiol (6) followed by oxidation of the resulting thioether to the sulfoxide yields the final product: rabeprazole (8).

=== Comparative chemistry ===
The chemical structures in Table 2 illustrate the comparative chemistry of rabeprazole among other members of the PPI class. The structures vary by the substitution of side chains on either the benzimidazole or pyridine ring structures. Omeprazole, for example, has a methoxy moiety (CH3O-) on the benzimidazole ring at position 5, whereas pantoprazole has a difluoromethoxy (CHF2O-) chain at position 5. Lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy (CF3-CH2-O-) chain on the pyridine ring at position 4, whereas rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy (CH3-O-(CH2)3-O-) chain at position 4. Esomeprazole and deslansoprazole represent stereoisomers of omeprazole and lansoprazole respectively.


===Physiochemical properties===
Rabeprazole is characterized as a white to yellowish-white solid in its pure form. It is soluble in a number of solvents. Rabeprazole is very soluble in water and methanol, freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ethyl acetate, and is insoluble in ether and n-hexane. It is unstable under humid conditions.

==History==
Rabeprazole was first marketed in Europe in 1998. In 1999, one year later, rabeprazole was approved for use in the United States.

===Development===
Developed by Eisai Medical Research by the research names E3810 and LY307640, the pre-investigational new drug application was submitted on October 28, 1998. The final investigational new drug application was submitted August 6, 1999. On August 19, 1999, rabeprazole was approved in the US for multiple gastrointestinal indications. The approval for the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease was on February 12, 2002.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
Rabeprazole is approved in the United States and the United Kingdom for prescription use only. Rabeprazole was approved in India in December 2001. It was approved in Japan in 1997, and in all European Union member countries since.

===Brand names===
Rabeprazole has been sold in a number of brand names:

==Research==
An alternative formulation of rabeprazole, termed &quot;rabeprazole-ER&quot; (extended release) has been developed. The purpose of the formulation was to increase the half-life of rabeprazole, which normally is very short in humans. Rabeprazole-ER was a 50 mg capsule composed of five non-identical 10 mg tablets that were designed to release rabeprazole at differing intervals throughout the gastrointestinal system. However, because two high quality clinical trials failed to demonstrate a benefit of rabeprazole-ER versus esomeprazole (another common PPI) for healing grade C or D erosive esophagitis, the development of rabeprazole-ER ceased.

<text>DTour (styled as DTOUR) is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned by TVTropolis G.P., a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment.

The channel was originally established by Canwest in 1997 as Prime, a cable companion to Global with a general entertainment format focusing on classic series and programming acquired from Global and CH. In 2006, the channel was re-branded as TVTropolis, carrying a similar format but with a focus on contemporary sitcoms and dramas from the 1980s and 1990s, as well as pop culture-themed programs. 

Adopting its current branding in 2013, DTour largely draws its acquired programming from the U.S.-based Travel Channel, while also airing limited general-interest programing. In February 2025, it was revealed on TV Passport that the channel will lose the Travel Channel programming as of March 2025; Corus has yet to confirm this plan.

==History==
===As Prime and TVTropolis===
The channel was launched as Prime on October 17, 1997, under the ownership of Canwest. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licensed Prime in 1996 as a specialty television service directed towards men and women 50 years of age and older. However, the channel did not explicitly market itself as a channel for the &quot;baby boomer&quot; generation, preferring instead to position itself as a general entertainment channel. Prime&#x27;s slogan, on-air and in advertising, was &quot;Canada&#x27;s Entertainment Network&quot;. Prime&#x27;s schedule featured a mix of general interest television programs, including home improvement and design series, along with classic television series.

With the launch of sibling channel DejaView in 2001, (showing similar programming to Prime, that being classic television programs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s), the channel&#x27;s focus shifted to shows from the late 1980s and beyond.

On June 1, 2006, Prime was rebranded as TVTropolis, which initially focused on sitcoms and dramas from the 1980s and 1990s (such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, branded under the slogan &quot;Hit TV Lives Here&quot;). Additional series focused on television pop culture (such as &quot;Inside the Box&quot; and &quot;FANatical&quot;). Over time, the channel lessened its emphasis on scripted shows and reverted to a general entertainment format; focusing on reality series, game shows (including original series &quot;Wipeout Canada&quot;), and lifestyle series with little emphasis on pop culture.

On October 27, 2010, Shaw Communications purchased Canwest after it had entered into creditor bankruptcy protection in late 2009. As a result, Shaw acquired control of Canwest&#x27;s stake in TVtropolis and rebranded Canwest as Shaw Media. On January 14, 2013, Shaw announced that it would purchase the remaining interest in TVtropolis from Rogers Communications for $59 million, bringing its total to 100%.

===As DTour===
On June 5, 2013, at its annual upfront, Shaw conspicuously removed any reference to TVtropolis in announcing its fall programming plans, while announcing a &quot;new&quot; lifestyle channel named DTour (stylized as &quot;DTOUR&quot;). It was later confirmed through a Telus update to subscribers that DTour would be launched as a rebranded TVtropolis on August 26, 2013. 
The relaunch of the channel occurred that day at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

A high definition feed of DTour was introduced on Shaw Cable on September 5, 2013. Following the rebrand, DejaView would begin airing some of the 1990s vintage series that had aired on TVtropolis.

DTour&#x27;s initial lineup featured programming from Travel Channel in the U.S. (including &quot;Adam Richman&#x27;s Fandemonium&quot;, &quot;Hotel Impossible&quot; and &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot;). Travel Channel was owned by Scripps Networks Interactive, which at the time jointly owned the Canadian versions of Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network with Shaw. DTour was not explicitly marketed as a &quot;travel&quot; service, as it would have conflicted with rival service Travel + Escape (now T+E); which had sole use of the travel niche at the time under the CRTC&#x27;s channel categorization rules. Those rules have since been revoked, with T+E subsequently abandoning the travel genre in favor of paranormal programming.

On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment.

When Corus lost the rights to most Warner Bros. Discovery lifestyle and factual brands to Rogers Sports &amp; Media at the end of 2024, DTour and the Travel Channel programming that it was airing at the time were initially not going to be affected by the changes. However, in February 2025, it was revealed on TV Passport that Corus would lose the rights to the Travel Channel programming as of March 2025; Corus has yet to confirm this plan.

==Programming==

DTour currently airs a mix of travel, lifestyle, and paranormal programming; much of which is sourced from the Warner Bros. Discovery-owned Travel Channel and Destination America channels in the U.S.. As Prime and TVTropolis, the channel has aired vintage and classic television shows, animated series, reality series, game shows, and other general entertainment programming.

<doc id="805745" wikidata="Q3211475" url="?curid=805745" title="Leschi (Nisqually)">
<text>Chief Leschi (; ; c. 1808 – February 19, 1858) was a chief of the Nisqually Indian Tribe of southern Puget Sound, Washington, primarily in the area of the Nisqually River.

Following outbreaks of violence and the Yakima Wars (1855–1858), as a leader Leschi was charged with the killings of two Washington Territorial Volunteers. He was hanged for murder on February 19, 1858, although supporters argued that he could not be charged with murder in the death of a combatant in a recognized war. Leschi was informally exonerated in a non-legally binding ruling in 2004 by a Historical Court of Inquiry of Washington State, following a resolution by both houses of the legislature asking the State Supreme Court to vacate his conviction.

==Life==

Leschi was born in about 1808 into the &quot;Mishalpam&quot; (″Mashel River people″) or &quot;Mica&#x27;l Band of Upper (Mountain) Nisqually&quot; to a Nisqually chief and a Klickitat (X̣ʷáɬx̣ʷaypam - &quot;Prairie People&quot;) woman of the Yakama (Mámachatpam). Their primary village site was &quot;Basha&#x27;labsh&quot; on Mashel River near present La Grande, Washington in what is today southern Pierce County, Washington. He also had an older brother, Quiemuth, and a sister. The Nisqually people (Squalli-Absch - &quot;people of the grass&quot;) traditionally occupied a large area along the Nisqually River and its delta at the foot of Puget Sound, an area rich in fish and game. Leschi was respected by his people. The origin of Leschi&#x27;s name is unknown. Leschi more than likely adopted it, and it may have been influenced by a distant relative, or he may have just enjoyed the sound of it.

Isaac Stevens, first governor of Washington Territory, appointed Leschi as chief in 1854 to represent the Nisqually and Puyallup tribes at the Medicine Creek Treaty council of December 26 of that year. Under pressure, the tribes ceded to the United States all or part of present-day King, Pierce, Lewis, Grays Harbor, Mason, and Thurston counties, agreeing to the requirement that the American Indians inhabiting the area move to reservations.

Some historians say that Leschi either refused to sign (and his &quot;X&quot; was forged by another) or signed under protest. The historical record is unclear on this point. He was reported as arguing that the territory designated as the reservation for the Nisqually tribe was a rocky piece of high ground unsuited to growing food and cut off from access to the Nisqually River, which had provided the salmon that was the mainstay of their diets and culture.

On June 11, 1855, Governor Isaac I. Stevens forced representatives from the Yakima, Nez Perce, Walla Walla, Umatilla and Cayuse tribes to sign a treaty in which the various tribes signed away vast amounts of land in return for money, reservations, and other provisions. Although the treaty stated that white miners would not be allowed on reservation lands, miners frequently passed through these lands, stealing horses from the tribes and abusing Native American women. The Yakima killed some miners in retaliation. When Indian sub-agent, Andrew J. Bolon, tried to investigate the murders, he was killed. Fighting broke out between Major Haller&#x27;s troops and the Yakima. This conflict marked the start of the Yakima War (1855–56).

Leschi was charged for these murders, in part because of his participation in the Yakima War of 1855–1858. He also was charged for his role in the Battle of Seattle, which took place in January 1856. This battle was of little consequence for the whites, since the natives were held off by the cannons of the &quot;Decatur,&quot; a naval warship with a crew of about 30. They inflicted little damage on Americans. But Chief Leschi had reportedly been seen commanding the native troops, and was credited with the native attack as a whole. His standing deteriorated among white settlers. Despite this, Stevens was convinced that white settlers were cooperating with Leschi. Stevens declared martial law over Pierce County on April 2, 1856. (Stevens was later charged with contempt of court in relation to this declaration; as governor; however, he pardoned himself.)

On October 30, 1855, seven Washington Territorial Volunteers were attacked by Indians at Connell&#x27;s Prairie, or Tenalcut Prairie, located between Buckley and Lake Tapps along the White River (in present-day Pierce County). Two were killed, Colonel A. Benton Moses and Joseph Miles. A year later, when hostilities had quieted somewhat, Governor Isaac I. Stevens of Washington Territory, requested that federal troops deliver five Indians for trial. One was Chief Leschi, charged with the murder of Moses. But the federal troops had concluded a peace with Leschi, who had fled east of the Cascades when his war failed. Stevens remained adamant, and the federal troops agreed to find Leschi. They offered fifty blankets for information leading to the arrest and capture of Leschi. Sluggia, a nephew of Leschi, and Eli-ku-kah, a Nisqually, delivered Leschi to the whites. Sluggia had formed a relationship with the chief&#x27;s youngest wife Mary, which may have added to his zeal to capture Leschi and turn him over to Stevens. Sluggia was later killed by a Leschi loyalist named Wahelut, who was outraged over the nephew&#x27;s treachery. Wahelnut&#x27;s fatal shooting of Sluggia was approved by the local tribes.

Leschi was taken into federal custody in early November 1856, and his brother Quiemuth surrendered shortly thereafter. Quiemuth was murdered on November 18, 1856, by an unknown assailant, in Governor Stevens&#x27; office in Olympia. He was being held there for the night on the way to the jail at Fort Steilacoom (now in Lakewood, Washington).

Leschi was put on trial on November 17, 1856, for the murder of Colonel Moses, which he denied having committed. His first trial resulted in a hung jury; the judge had instructed the jury that killing of combatants during wartime did not constitute murder. The second trial began on March 18, 1857. The judge did not give this instruction, and the court did not allow Leschi&#x27;s defense lawyers, Frank Clark and William Wallace, to introduce potentially exonerating evidence. The testimony of Antonio B. Rabbeson swayed the jury&#x27;s verdict of guilty. Rabbeson was said to have vague testimony, but the defense could do little to refute it. Leschi and his lawyer team tried to present a map that refuted Rabbeson&#x27;s details of the event as physically impossible, but the jury appeared to have difficulty understanding it.

Sometime after his second trial, Leschi was seen to make the &quot;sign of the cross&quot; and heard to speak a Christian prayer. Leschi is believed to have received a Catholic baptism before his second trial. He was baptized by Father Chirouse, who was fairly fluent in Salish, Leschi&#x27;s native language. Father Chirouse had performed the marriage of Leschi and his youngest wife, Mary. Leschi was convicted and sentenced to death, to be hanged June 10, 1857.

Supporter William Fraser Tolmie petitioned the new governor, LaFayette McMullen, to pardon Leschi, but the governor refused. United States Army officer August Kautz, another supporter, published two issues of a newspaper defending Leschi. Titled the &quot;Truth Teller&quot;, the newspaper&#x27;s masthead said: &quot;Devoted to the Dissemination of Truth and the Suppression of Humbug.&quot; The first issue of the paper containing this masthead was published on February 3, 1858; it had four pages of columns and articles that favored Leschi and his innocence. Kautz also included his recollections of the survey he had carried out at the crime scene, which he believed strongly discredited Rabbeson&#x27;s account of the attack. Tolmie&#x27;s petition and the front page of the &quot;Truth Teller&quot; are reprinted in Ezra Meeker&#x27;s 1905 history, &quot;The Tragedy of Leschi&quot;, which was republished in 1980. 
Meeker was on the first jury, and one of two men who voted for acquittal. Military officers refused to execute Leschi, as they said he was a valid war combatant and should not be tried. Pierce County authorities conducted the execution. It was postponed to January 22, 1858, to allow an appeal to the Territorial Supreme Court.

==Execution==
Leschi&#x27;s supporters arranged an elaborate plot in which the Pierce County sheriff, George Williams, agreed to be arrested by sympathetic members of the United States Army rather than carry out the execution. Other Pierce County officials arranged for the execution on February 19, 1858, when Leschi was hanged in a small valley, from a hastily constructed gallows near Lake Steilacoom.

The land was later developed as a golf course and, more recently, suburban housing. A small stone monument to Leschi was installed in a Lakewood strip mall in 1963. The hangman, Charles Grainger, later said &quot;I felt then I was hanging an innocent man, and I believe it yet.&quot; Some of Leschi&#x27;s last words were, 
&quot;I do not know anything about your laws. I have supposed that the killing of armed men in wartime was not murder; if it was, the soldiers who killed Indians are guilty of murder too... I went to war because I believed that the Indian had been wronged by the White men, and I did everything in my power to beat the Boston soldiers, but, for lack of numbers, supplies, and ammunition, I have failed.&quot;

On February 5 the second issue of &quot;The Truth Teller&quot; was published; it continued to defend the innocence of Leschi. Kautz sent numerous issues to Gov McMullin&#x27;s district in Tennessee, as a last reminder of how McMullin&#x27;s inaction led to the death of an innocent man.

==Legacy==
In the late 1880s, developer Frederick J. Grant named the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle after the chief. Other places commemorate the chief by name: Leschi Park; schools in Seattle and Puyallup; and streets in Seattle, Lakewood, Steilacoom, Anderson Island, and Olympia, all bear his name. Additionally, the MOUT site at Joint Base Lewis-McChord is named Leschi Town in his honor. A fireboat of the Seattle Fire Department, &quot;Leschi&quot;, also bears his name.

In March 2004, both houses of the Washington state legislature passed resolutions stating that Leschi was wrongly convicted and executed, and asking the state supreme court to vacate Leschi&#x27;s conviction. The court&#x27;s chief justice, however, said that this was unlikely to happen. It was not clear that the state court had jurisdiction in a matter decided 146 years earlier in a territorial court. On December 10, 2004, Chief Leschi was informally exonerated by a unanimous vote by a Historical Court of Inquiry following a definitive trial &quot;in absentia.&quot; The exoneration was not legally binding.

<doc id="805746" wikidata="Q1016750" url="?curid=805746" title="Burn My Eyes">
<text>Burn My Eyes is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Machine Head, released on August 9, 1994, by Roadrunner Records. The album&#x27;s themes generally tie into the social disorder and corresponding inner tension that the band was exposed to in their native Oakland, California, reflected in Robb Flynn&#x27;s lyrics, such as the Los Angeles Riots of 1992 and the Waco Siege of 1993. The album&#x27;s title alludes to the third part of the phrase, &quot;Burn my eyes and try to blind me&quot; during the breakdown of &quot;Old&quot;. The album shipped over 400,000 copies worldwide, becoming Roadrunner Records&#x27;s best-selling debut album until the release of Slipknot&#x27;s self-titled debut album. This is Machine Head&#x27;s only studio album to feature drummer Chris Kontos.

== Album information ==
The songs make references to some certain well-publicized controversies such as the 1992 Los Angeles Riots (heard in dialogue on &quot;Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies&quot;) and the Waco Siege of 1993 (&quot;Davidian&quot;). Elsewhere, there are tales of physical and mental abuse (&quot;None But My Own&quot;, &quot;The Rage to Overcome&quot;), the condemning of profits from religious soliciting (&quot;Death Church&quot;), succumbing to substance abuse (&quot;I&#x27;m Your God Now&quot;), and aforementioned themes of urban decay, social unrest, rebellion, belligerence, or socio-political commentary.

Stylistically, the album is credited as having bridged the gap between &quot;second-generation Bay Area thrash (Testament, Death Angel, etc.) and the modern-day Pantera school of hard knocks.&quot; Compared to their later releases, it&#x27;s rawer and more aggressive; after changing their sound on their three subsequent albums, the style was resurrected in modified form—the influences of Gothenburg were evident—on their post-&quot;Supercharger&quot; output.

The release of this album was followed shortly by numerous tours, which eventually led to drummer Chris Kontos leaving the band and being replaced, after careful consideration, by Dave McClain, who would stay with the band until 2018. Kontos, along with guitarist Logan Mader, would return to Machine Head in 2019 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot;″s release with a tour, though neither of them officially rejoined the band.

The album has since become a lasting success. In 1994, it quickly became a Roadrunner Records best seller and was the label&#x27;s best-selling debut album for a number of years, until the release of Slipknot&#x27;s 1999 self-titled debut.

== Cancelled re-release ==
On October 31, 2006, Roadrunner Records announced that as part of their 25th anniversary, they would be re-releasing &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; with a bonus CD, which includes previously unreleased tracks and rarities. It was said to be due out on January 8, 2007, but was then pushed back to September 2007 so it would not interfere with the release of &quot;The Blackening&quot;. However, the re-release was cancelled. Robb Flynn explained this on his blog, which is posted on Machinehead1.com:

== Reception ==

* &quot;Q&quot; magazine – &quot;A violent, grinding experience, spiked with social comment and spruced up with some brain-tingling guitar solos. Straddling the new &#x27;90s metal subject matter of religion, war and injustice, &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; is a colossal album, a landmark.&quot;

<text>Malvern St James is an independent school for girls in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England. Founded in 1893 as Malvern Girls&#x27; College, it was renamed Malvern St James following a merger in 2006 with St James&#x27;s School in West Malvern. It continues to occupy the same campus as the former college, which includes as its main building the former Imperial Hotel, taken over for use as a school by Malvern Girls&#x27; College in 1919.

The school comprises three sections: a Prep Department for girls aged 3–11, a Senior School for girls aged 11–16, and a Sixth Form for girls aged 16–18.

==History==
===Two schools===
Malvern Girls&#x27; College was founded in 1893 by Miss Greenslade and Miss Poulton, and was first located in College Road.

In 1919 they acquired the Imperial Hotel and in 1934, a major extension including an assembly hall was built. Further extensions included the Hatfield building in the 1960s, the Edinburgh Dome in 1977 and The Science Education Centre in 1998.

St James&#x27;s School was founded in the south of England by twin sisters Alice and Katrine Baird in 1896 and moved to the large mansion of Lord Howard de Walden in West Malvern in 1902. The Abbey School was founded in Blockley, Worcestershire and moved to Malvern in 1897 and to Malvern Wells in 1908. Two of the Baird sisters, Diana and Alice, ran the two houses for students: the Junior House, for the girls aged 11–14, and the Senior House for girls above 14. &quot;The Miss Bairds were remarkable: five spinster sisters all over six feet tall and all to be Head Mistresses.&quot; The girls wore a simple uniform: white cotton shirts, navy blue coats and skirts. &quot;There were no &#x27;O Levels&#x27; or &#x27;A Levels&#x27; in those days, and exams were not taken seriously. &#x27;Citizenship&#x27; was what the Miss Bairds were most anxious to instill; it must be admitted with considerable success--many girls were later notable for lives of public service.&quot;

In 1979 the two schools merged on the West Malvern campus of St James and the resulting school was named St James&#x27;s &amp; The Abbey. In 1994 Lawnside School, which was founded around 1856, merged with St James&#x27;s &amp; The Abbey School and the school was renamed St James&#x27;s. In 2006, Malvern Girls&#x27; College merged with St James&#x27;s School and was refounded as Malvern St James (MSJ).

===Teaching===
In 2019, one of the set texts (&quot;Spies&quot; by Michael Frayn) had been removed from the sylabus of the English Literature International GCSE paper. The school apologised and launched an investigation into the incident, and applied to the exam board Cambridge International for &#x27;special consideration&#x27; in order that the mistake would not unfairly impact any grades.

Malvern St James received the highest rating of &#x27;Excellent&#x27; in the independent schools Inspectorate Educational Quality Inspection, published in May 2017.

== Structure and academic results ==
The school is divided into four areas MSJ Pre-Prep (Reception to Year 2), MSJ Prep (Year 3 to Year 6), MSJ Seniors (Year 7 to Year 11) and MSJ Sixth Form (Year 12 &amp; Year 13).

A-level results 2023: Students achieved 31% of grades at A*-A.

GCSE results 2023: 60% of the entries were graded 9-7.

A-level results 2021: Students achieved 43% of grades at A*, 75% at A*-A, 90% at A*-B and 98% at A*-C.

A-level results 2019: 44% of grades were at A* and A, and more than one in six students achieved a clean sweep of A* and A grades.

GCSE results 2019: 38% of entries scored a 9-8 or A* grades; and 55% of entries scored 9-7/A*-A grades.

== Boarding houses ==
The school offers full, weekly or flexi boarding. All girls whether they are boarders or day girls are a part of the boarding community. There are five boarding houses each dedicated to caring for a specific age group: Batsford, Benhams, Austen, Poulton and Greenslade.

==Architecture==

===The Imperial Hotel===

Following the collapse of the spa industry, many of the hotels were acquired for use as private boarding schools, and education became the basis of Malvern&#x27;s economy; the Imperial Hotel was purchased by the school in 1919. The former hotel is directly opposite Great Malvern railway station, with its dedicated (now derelict) tunnel to the basement of the building, which is clearly visible from both platforms of the station. The red brick and stone Imperial Hotel, which had been the largest in Malvern during the town&#x27;s heyday as a spa in the second half of the 19th century, is still one of the largest buildings in Malvern and was built in 1860 by the architect E. W. Elmslie. He also designed the Great Malvern railway station, the Council House and The Grove in Avenue Road in 1867, originally to be his private residence, which in 1927 became part of the Lawnside School. The Imperial was the first hotel to be lit by incandescent gas. It was equipped with all types of baths and brine was brought specially by rail from Droitwich. In 1934 the building was extended with the addition of the York Hall, officially opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

===The Edinburgh Dome===

The school campus has a listed sports hall – The Edinburgh Dome, so named as it was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. It consists of a round, green, balloon-shaped building, containing squash courts, a gym area and a games area, surrounded by a moat. Based on an innovative roof construction by Dante Bini, the Binishell (or Parashell), it was built in 1977 by architect Michael Godwin and consultant engineer John Faber. It was opened in 1978. On the advice of English Heritage it has been designated a Grade II listed building.

<doc id="805752" wikidata="Q362735" url="?curid=805752" title="Tritium radioluminescence">
<text>Tritium radioluminescence is the use of gaseous tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, to create visible light. Tritium emits electrons through beta decay and, when they interact with a phosphor material, light is emitted through the process of phosphorescence. The overall process of using a radioactive material to excite a phosphor and ultimately generate light is called radioluminescence. As tritium illumination requires no electrical energy, it has found wide use in applications such as emergency exit signs, illumination of wristwatches, and portable yet very reliable sources of low intensity light which won&#x27;t degrade human night vision. Gun sights for night use and small lights (which need to be more reliable than battery powered lights, yet not interfere with night vision or be bright enough to easily give away one&#x27;s location) used mostly by military personnel fall under the latter application.

==History==
Tritium was found to be an ideal energy source for self-luminous compounds in 1953 and the idea was patented by Edward Shapiro on 29 October 1953, in the US (2749251 – Source of Luminosity).

==Design==

Tritium lighting is made using glass tubes with a phosphor layer in them and tritium gas inside the tube. Such a tube is known as a &quot;gaseous tritium light source&quot; (GTLS), or &quot;beta light&quot; (since the tritium undergoes beta decay), or tritium lamp.

The tritium in a gaseous tritium light source undergoes beta (β) decay, releasing electrons that cause the phosphor layer to phosphoresce.

During manufacture, a length of borosilicate glass tube that has had the internal surface coated with a phosphor-containing material is filled with tritium. The tube is then sealed at the desired length using a carbon dioxide laser. Borosilicate is preferred for its strength and resistance to breakage. In the tube, the tritium gives off a steady stream of electrons due to β decay. These particles excite the phosphor, causing it to emit a low, steady glow. 

Tritium is not the only material that can be used for self-powered lighting. Radium was used to make self-luminous paint from the early 20th century to about 1970. Promethium briefly replaced radium as a radiation source. Tritium is the only radiation source used in radioluminescent light sources today due to its low radiological toxicity and commercial availability.

Various preparations of the phosphor compound can be used to produce different colors of light. For example, doping zinc sulfide phosphor with different metals can change the emission wavelength. Some of the colors that have been manufactured in addition to the common phosphors are green, red, blue, yellow, purple, orange, and white. 

The GTLSs used in watches give off a small amount of light: Not enough to be seen in daylight, but visible in the dark from a distance of several meters. The average such GTLS has a useful life of 10–20 years. The rate of β emissions decreases by half in each half-life (12.32 years). Also, phosphor degradation will cause the brightness of a tritium tube to drop by more than half in that period. The more tritium is initially placed in the tube, the brighter it is to begin with, and the longer its useful life. Tritium exit signs usually come in three brightness levels guaranteed for 10, 15, or 20-year useful life expectancies. The difference between the signs is how much tritium the manufacturer installs.

The light produced by GTLSs varies in color and size. Green usually appears as the brightest color with a brightness as high as 2 cd/m and red appears the least bright. For comparison, most consumer desktop liquid crystal displays have luminances of 200 to 300 cd/m. Sizes range from tiny tubes small enough to fit on the hand of a watch to ones the size of a pencil. Large tubes (5 mm diameter and up to 100 mm long) are usually only found in green, and can surprisingly be not as bright as the standard 22.5 mm × 3 mm sized tritium, this is due to the lower concentration and high cost of tritium; this smaller size is usually the brightest and is used mainly in keychains available commercially.

==Uses==

These light sources are most often seen as &quot;permanent&quot; illumination for the hands of wristwatches intended for diving, nighttime, or combat use. They are also used in glowing novelty keychains and in self-illuminated exit signs. They are favored by the military for applications where a power source may not be available, such as for instrument dials in aircraft, compasses, and sights for weapons. In the case of solid tritium light sources, the tritium replaces some of the hydrogen atoms in the paint, which also contains a phosphor such as zinc sulfide.

Tritium lights or &quot;beta lights&quot; were formerly used in fishing lures. Some flashlights have slots for tritium vials so that the flashlight can be easily located in the dark.

Tritium is used to illuminate the iron sights of some small arms. The reticle on the SA80&#x27;s optical SUSAT sight as well as the LPS 4x6° TIP2 telescopic sight of a PSL rifle, contains a small amount of tritium for the same effect as an example of tritium use on a rifle sight. The electrons emitted by the radioactive decay of the tritium cause phosphor to glow, thus providing a long-lasting (several years) and non-battery-powered firearms sight that is visible in dim lighting conditions. The tritium glow is not noticeable in bright conditions such as during daylight, however; consequently some manufacturers have started to integrate fiber optic sights with tritium vials to provide bright, high-contrast firearms sights in both bright and dim conditions.

==Safety==

Though these devices contain a radioactive substance, it is currently believed that self-powered lighting does not pose a significant health concern. A 2007 report by the UK government&#x27;s Health Protection Agency Advisory Group on Ionizing Radiation declared the health risks of tritium exposure to be double that previously set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, but encapsulated tritium lighting devices, typically taking the form of a luminous glass tube embedded in a thick block of clear plastic, prevent the user from being exposed to the tritium at all unless the device is broken apart.

Tritium presents no external beta radiation threat when encapsulated in non-hydrogen-permeable containers due to its low penetration depth, which is too short to penetrate intact human skin. However, GTLS devices do emit low levels of X-rays due to bremsstrahlung. According to a report by the OECD, any external radiation from a gaseous tritium light device is solely due to bremsstrahlung, usually in the range of 8–14 keV. The bremsstrahlung dose rate cannot be calculated from the properties of tritium alone, as the dose rate and effective energy is dependent on the form of containment. A bare, cylindrical vial GTLS constructed of 0.1 mm thick glass that is 10 mm long and 0.5 mm in diameter will yield a surface dose rate of 100 millirads per hour per curie. If the same vial were instead constructed of 1 mm thick glass and enclosed in a plastic covering that is 2–3 mm thick, the GTLS will yield a surface dose rate of 1 millirad per hour per curie. The dose rate measured from 10 mm away will be two orders of magnitude lower than the measured surface dose rate. Given that the half-value thickness of 10 keV photon radiation in water is about 1.4 mm, the attenuation provided by tissue overlaying blood-forming organs is considerable.

The primary danger from tritium arises if it is inhaled, ingested, injected, or absorbed into the body. This results in the absorption of the emitted radiation in a small region of the body, again due to the low penetration depth. The biological half-life of tritium – the time it takes for half of an ingested dose to be expelled from the body – is low, at only 12 days. Tritium excretion can be accelerated further by increasing water intake to 3–4 liters/day. Direct, short-term exposure to small amounts of tritium is mostly harmless. If a tritium tube breaks, one should leave the area and allow the gas to diffuse into the air. Tritium exists naturally in the environment, but in very small quantities.

==Legislation==

Products containing tritium are controlled by law because tritium is used in boosted fission weapons and thermonuclear weapons (though in quantities several thousand times larger than that in a keychain). In the US, devices such as self-luminous exit signs, gauges, wristwatches, etc. that contain small amounts of tritium are under the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and are subject to possession, distribution, and import and export regulations found in 10 CFR Parts, 30, 32, and 110. They are also subject to regulations for possession, use, and disposal in certain states. Luminous products containing more tritium than needed for a wristwatch are not widely available at retail outlets in the United States.

They are readily sold and used in the UK and US. They are regulated in England and Wales by environmental health departments of local councils. In Australia products containing tritium are licence exempt if they contain less than tritium and have a total activity of less than , except for in safety devices where the limit is total activity.

<text>Atys is a genus of very small to medium-sized sea snails, marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the family Haminoeidae.

All the species within the genus Atys are herbivores. They occur in tropical and warm oceans and seas. They are cephalaspideans, part of the suborder of headshield slugs and bubble snails.

The genus was named after Atys, a king of Alba Longa, who was mentioned in ancient Greek texts.

==Description==
These snails have a shell which is very lightweight and translucent, with a sunken spire. The shape of the shell in some species resembles a bubble, and because of this, species in this genus are commonly known as Atys bubble shells or Atys bubble snails. (Several other shelled families within the Cephalaspidea are even more commonly known as &quot;bubble shells&quot; or &quot;bubble snails&quot;, for example, the Bullidae.)

The anatomy of the soft parts of most species within this genus has not been studied, but it seems that some of the species in this genus can not reliably be discriminated on the basis of shell characters alone. Unfortunately however, a considerable number of the species were originally named from empty shells, and as a result, their exact identity may be problematic.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Atys&quot; include:

<text>Comedy Gold, formerly known as TV Land Canada was a Canadian English language specialty channel that was owned by Bell Media focused on sitcoms and sketch comedy programs from the 1970s to 1990s.

The channel was originally launched in 2001 as a Canadian version of the U.S. channel TV Land by Craig Media and Viacom (currently known as &quot;Paramount&quot;). Craig&#x27;s interest was acquired by CHUM Limited, the owner of the Citytv system in 2004 upon the acquisition of its assets. In the years following the acquisition of CHUM by CTVglobemedia and later Bell Media, TV Land Canada was renamed to Comedy Gold and became a sister network to The Comedy Network.

After the sale to WOW Unlimited and aborted attempt for relaunch, Comedy Gold ceased operations in 2019.

==History==
===TV Land Canada===
On November 24, 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted Craig Media (previously known as Craig Broadcast Systems Inc.) permission to launch a national Category 2 digital specialty channel tentatively known as &quot;Retro&quot;; a channel described as being &quot;devoted to classic television programming&quot;.
In August 2001, before the channel had launched, Craig Media announced it had reached a deal with U.S.-based MTV Networks (now part of Paramount), to launch Retro as a domestic Canadian version of the U.S. classic television-focused cable channel, TV Land. The channel was launched in September 2001 as TV Land Canada, with a slate of programming focusing on classic U.S. sitcoms and dramas. MTV Networks purchased a minority share in the service months later.

In April 2004, CHUM Limited announced it would purchase Craig Media for CAD$265 million; Craig&#x27;s 80.1% interest in TV Land was included in the sale, primarily to gain control of its A-Channel television stations in western Canada (which joined its Citytv brand). The sale was subject to CRTC approval and was approved on November 19, 2004. The transaction was completed on December 1, 2004. 

In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM, including TV Land Canada, for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion. The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007, with the transaction completed on June 22.
On June 21, 2010, it was announced that TV Land would be rebranded as &quot;Comedy Gold&quot;, becoming an offshoot of The Comedy Network, effective August 2, 2010. The rebranded channel shifted focus to classic U.S. sitcoms from the 1970s through the 1990s including &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. Viacom sold its stake in the channel back to CTV after the rebrand took place.

The channel&#x27;s ownership changed hands once again when on September 10, 2010, BCE Inc. (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of CAD$3.2 billion. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011, and was finalized on April 1 of that year, on which CTVglobemedia was rebranded Bell Media. In June 2012, Comedy Gold unveiled a new on-air look consisting of a new logo and new on-air presentation, aligning with the relaunched Comedy Network, which itself had unveiled a new on-air rebrand in November 2011.

=== Sale to Wow Unlimited Media, planned and aborted re-launch ===
In June 2017, Wow Unlimited Media announced a strategic partnership with Bell, under which it would acquire an unspecified category B service to re-launch as a channel targeting children and young adults, in exchange for a minority equity stake in the company. In an October 2017 interview, Bell Media president Randy Lennox revealed that the channel would be Comedy Gold. The sale to Wow Unlimited Media was approved on July 9, 2018.

On March 12, 2019, Wow Unlimited Media issued a press release stating the date upon which the channel would be fully acquired has been pushed back to either May 31, 2019, or August 30, 2019 &quot;to pursue sponsorships and partnerships&quot;. On July 24, 2019, a representative of Bell Support revealed that Comedy Gold would be shutting down anywhere between August 30 and September 1. Wow took possession of the license on August 30, and Comedy Gold was ultimately shuttered on September 1. In its second-quarter earnings report, Wow stated that the company was &quot;exploring strategic partnerships to structure a financially attractive business plan&quot; for the network.

In an application sent to the CRTC, dated July 20, 2020, Wow Unlimited requested revocation of its broadcast license for Comedy Gold citing numerous reasons for abandoning the channel, including, but not limited to, the global pandemic, the growing dominance of online streaming services (specifically naming Disney+, Netflix, and Paramount+), the growth of direct-to-consumer AVOD platforms, the significant decrease in ad spending on traditional broadcast channels, the difficulty in acquiring quality content when competing against large multi-national companies such as Netflix, and the crash of the wireline children&#x27;s TV market making a new network based around that programming unfeasible. The CRTC granted the application&#x27;s approval and revoked the license on February 5, 2021.

==Programming==

Prior to the announced sale to Wow Unlimited Media, Comedy Gold focused primarily on sitcoms and sketch comedy programs from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (such as &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;); it also carried some Canadian-produced programs (such as &quot;Inside the Box&quot; and &quot;Second City Television&quot;).

Since the announcement of its sale to Wow Unlimited Media, Comedy Gold&#x27;s focus on classic comedy was downplayed and its programming shifted to reruns of general comedy-oriented shows.

<text>In computer science and particularly in compiler design, loop nest optimization (LNO) is an optimization technique that applies a set of loop transformations for the purpose of locality optimization or parallelization or another loop overhead reduction of the loop nests. (Nested loops occur when one loop is inside of another loop.) One classical usage is to reduce memory access latency or the cache bandwidth necessary due to cache reuse for some common linear algebra algorithms.

The technique used to produce this optimization is called loop tiling, also known as loop blocking or strip mine and interchange.

== Overview ==
Loop tiling partitions a loop&#x27;s iteration space into smaller chunks or blocks, so as to help ensure data used in a loop stays in the cache until it is reused. The partitioning of loop iteration space leads to partitioning of a large array into smaller blocks, thus fitting accessed array elements into cache size, enhancing cache reuse and eliminating cache size requirements.

An ordinary loop

for (i=0; i&lt;N; ++i) {
}

can be blocked with a block size B by replacing it with 

for (j=0; j&lt;N; j+=B) {
 for (i=j; i&lt;min(N, j+B); ++i) {
 }

where codice_1 is a function returning the minimum of its arguments.

== Example: matrix-vector multiplication ==

The following is an example of matrix vector multiplication. There are three arrays, each with 100 elements. The code does not partition the arrays into smaller sizes.
 int i, j, a[100][100], b[100], c[100];
 int n = 100;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 c[i] = 0;
 for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
 c[i] = c[i] + a[i][j] * b[j];
 }
After loop tiling is applied using 2 * 2 blocks, the code looks like:
 int i, j, x, y, a[100][100], b[100], c[100];
 int n = 100;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i += 2) {
 c[i] = 0;
 c[i + 1] = 0;
 for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j += 2) {
 for (x = i; x &lt; min(i + 2, n); x++) {
 for (y = j; y &lt; min(j + 2, n); y++) {
 c[x] = c[x] + a[x][y] * b[y];
 }
 }
The original loop iteration space is &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot;. The accessed chunk of array a[i, j] is also &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot;. When &quot;n&quot; is too large and the cache size of the machine is too small, the accessed array elements in one loop iteration (for example, codice_2, codice_3) may cross cache lines, causing cache misses.

==Tiling size==
It is not always easy to decide what value of tiling size is optimal for one loop because it demands an accurate estimate of accessed array regions in the loop and the cache size of the target machine. The order of loop nests (loop interchange) also plays an important role in achieving better cache performance. Explicit blocking requires choosing a tile size based on these factors. By contrast, cache-oblivious algorithms are designed to make efficient use of cache without explicit blocking.

==Example: matrix multiplication==
Many large mathematical operations on computers end up spending much of their time doing matrix multiplication. The operation is:

: C = A×B

where A, B, and C are N×N arrays. Subscripts, for the following description, are in form codice_4.

The basic loop is:
int i, j, k;

for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
 for (j = 0; j &lt; N; ++j)
 C[i][j] = 0;

 for (k = 0; k &lt; N; ++k)
 C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
}
There are three problems to solve:

* Floating point additions take some number of cycles to complete. In order to keep an adder with multiple cycle latency busy, the code must update multiple accumulators in parallel.
* Machines can typically do just one memory operation per multiply-add, so values loaded must be reused at least twice.
* Typical PC memory systems can only sustain one 8-byte doubleword per 10–30 double-precision multiply–adds, so values loaded into the cache must be reused many times.

The original loop calculates the result for one entry in the result matrix at a time. By calculating a small block of entries simultaneously, the following loop reuses each loaded value twice, so that the inner loop has four loads and four multiply–adds, thus solving problem #2. By carrying four accumulators simultaneously, this code can keep a single floating point adder with a latency of 4 busy nearly all the time (problem #1). However, the code does not address the third problem. (Nor does it address the cleanup work necessary when N is odd. Such details will be left out of the following discussion.)
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i += 2)
 for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j += 2)
 acc00 = acc01 = acc10 = acc11 = 0;
 for (k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
 acc00 += B[k][j + 0] * A[i + 0][k];
 acc01 += B[k][j + 1] * A[i + 0][k];
 acc10 += B[k][j + 0] * A[i + 1][k];
 acc11 += B[k][j + 1] * A[i + 1][k];
 C[i + 0][j + 0] = acc00;
 C[i + 0][j + 1] = acc01;
 C[i + 1][j + 0] = acc10;
 C[i + 1][j + 1] = acc11;
}
This code has had both the codice_5 and codice_6 iterations blocked by a factor of two and had both the resulting two-iteration inner loops completely unrolled.

This code would run quite acceptably on a Cray Y-MP (built in the early 1980s), which can sustain 0.8 multiply–adds per memory operation to main memory. A machine like a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4, built in 2003, has slightly less memory bandwidth and vastly better floating point, so that it can sustain 16.5 multiply–adds per memory operation. As a result, the code above will run slower on the 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 than on the 166 MHz Y-MP!

A machine with a longer floating-point add latency or with multiple adders would require more accumulators to run in parallel. It is easy to change the loop above to compute a 3x3 block instead of a 2x2 block, but the resulting code is not always faster. The loop requires registers to hold both the accumulators and the loaded and reused A and B values. A 2x2 block requires 7 registers. A 3x3 block requires 13, which will not work on a machine with just 8 floating point registers in the ISA. If the CPU does not have enough registers, the compiler will schedule extra loads and stores to spill the registers into stack slots, which will make the loop run slower than a smaller blocked loop.

Matrix multiplication is like many other codes in that it can be limited by memory bandwidth, and that more registers can help the compiler and programmer reduce the need for memory bandwidth. This &quot;register pressure&quot; is why vendors of RISC CPUs, who intended to build machines more parallel than the general purpose x86 and 68000 CPUs, adopted 32-entry floating-point register files.

The code above does not use the cache very well. During the calculation of a horizontal stripe of C results, one horizontal stripe of A is loaded, and the entire matrix B is loaded. For the entire calculation, C is stored once (that&#x27;s good), A is loaded into the cache once (assuming a stripe of A fits in the cache with a stripe of B), but B is loaded N/ib times, where ib is the size of the strip in the C matrix, for a total of N3/ib doubleword loads from main memory. In the code above, &quot;ib&quot; is 2.

The next step to reduce the memory traffic is to make ib as large as possible. It needs to be larger than the &quot;balance&quot; number reported by streams. In the case of one particular 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 system used for this example, the balance number is 16.5. The second code example above cannot be extended directly, since that would require many more accumulator registers. Instead, the loop is &quot;blocked&quot; over i. (Technically, this is actually the second time i is blocked, as the first time was the factor of 2.)
for (ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ii += ib)
 for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j += 2)
 for (i = ii; i &lt; ii + ib; i += 2)
 acc00 = acc01 = acc10 = acc11 = 0;
 for (k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
 acc00 += B[k][j + 0] * A[i + 0][k];
 acc01 += B[k][j + 1] * A[i + 0][k];
 acc10 += B[k][j + 0] * A[i + 1][k];
 acc11 += B[k][j + 1] * A[i + 1][k];
 C[i + 0][j + 0] = acc00;
 C[i + 0][j + 1] = acc01;
 C[i + 1][j + 0] = acc10;
 C[i + 1][j + 1] = acc11;
 }


With this code, ib can be set to any desired parameter, and the number of loads of the B matrix will be reduced by that factor. This freedom has a cost: N×ib slices of the A matrix are being kept in the cache. As long as that fits, this code will not be limited by the memory system.

So what size matrix fits? The example system, a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4, has a 16KB primary data cache. With ib=20, the slice of the A matrix in this code will be larger than the primary cache when N &gt; 100. For problems larger than that, another trick is needed.

That trick is reducing the size of the stripe of the B matrix by blocking the k loop so that the stripe is of size ib × kb. Blocking the k loop means that the C array will be loaded and stored N/kb times, for a total of memory transfers. B is still transferred N/ib times, for transfers. So long as
: 2*N/kb + N/ib &lt; N/balance
the machine&#x27;s memory system will keep up with the floating point unit and the code will run at maximum performance. The 16KB cache of the Pentium 4 is not quite big enough: if ib=24 and kb=64 were chosen instead, 12KB of the cache would be used—avoiding completely filling it, which is desirable so the C and B arrays have to have some room to flow through. These numbers come within 20% of the peak floating-point speed of the processor.

Here is the code with loop codice_7 blocked.
for (ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ii += ib)
 for (kk = 0; kk &lt; N; kk += kb)
 for (j=0; j &lt; N; j += 2)
 for (i = ii; i &lt; ii + ib; i += 2)
 if (kk == 0)
 acc00 = acc01 = acc10 = acc11 = 0;
 else
 acc00 = C[i + 0][j + 0];
 acc01 = C[i + 0][j + 1];
 acc10 = C[i + 1][j + 0];
 acc11 = C[i + 1][j + 1];
 for (k = kk; k &lt; kk + kb; k++)
 acc00 += B[k][j + 0] * A[i + 0][k];
 acc01 += B[k][j + 1] * A[i + 0][k];
 acc10 += B[k][j + 0] * A[i + 1][k];
 acc11 += B[k][j + 1] * A[i + 1][k];
 C[i + 0][j + 0] = acc00;
 C[i + 0][j + 1] = acc01;
 C[i + 1][j + 0] = acc10;
 C[i + 1][j + 1] = acc11;
 }
}
The above code examples do not show the details of dealing with values of N which are not multiples of the blocking factors. Compilers which do loop nest optimization emit code to clean up the edges of the computation. For example, most LNO compilers would probably split the kk == 0 iteration off from the rest of the codice_8 iterations, to remove the if statement from the codice_5 loop. This is one of the values of such a compiler: while it is straightforward to code the simple cases of this optimization, keeping all the details correct as the code is replicated and transformed is an error-prone process.

The above loop will only achieve 80% of peak flops on the example system when blocked for the 16KB L1 cache size. It will do worse on systems with even more unbalanced memory systems. Fortunately, the Pentium 4 has 256KB (or more, depending on the model) high-bandwidth level-2 cache as well as the level-1 cache. There is a choice:

* Adjust the block sizes for the level-2 cache. This will stress the processor&#x27;s ability to keep many instructions in flight simultaneously, and there is a good chance it will be unable to achieve full bandwidth from the level-2 cache.
* Block the loops again, again for the level-2 cache sizes. With a total of three levels of blocking (for the register file, for the L1 cache, and the L2 cache), the code will minimize the required bandwidth at each level of the memory hierarchy. Unfortunately, the extra levels of blocking will incur still more loop overhead, which for some problem sizes on some hardware may be more time-consuming than any shortcomings in the hardware&#x27;s ability to stream data from the L2 cache.

Rather than specifically tune for one particular cache size, as in the first example, a cache-oblivious algorithm is designed to take advantage of any available cache, no matter what its size is. This automatically takes advantage of two or more levels of memory hierarchy, if available. Cache-oblivious algorithms for matrix multiplication are known.

<text>The common slow-worm (Anguis fragilis) is a species of legless lizard native to western Eurasia. It is also called a deaf adder, blindworm, or regionally, a long-cripple, steelworm, and hazelworm. The &quot;blind&quot; in blind-worm refers to the lizard&#x27;s small eyes, similar to a blindsnake (although the slow-worm&#x27;s eyes are functional). The common slow worm, i.e. the species &quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;, is often called simply &quot;slow-worm&quot;, though the entire species complex Anguis is also called &quot;slow-worms&quot;.

Common slow worms are semifossorial (burrowing) lizards, spending much of their time hiding underneath objects. The skin of slow worms is smooth with scales that do not overlap one another. Like many other lizards, they autotomize, meaning that they have the ability to shed their tails to escape predators. While the tail regrows, it does not reach its original length. In the UK, they are common in gardens and allotments, and can be encouraged to enter and help remove pest insects by placing black plastic or providing places to shelter such as piles of logs, corrugated iron sheets or under tiles. On warm days, one or more slow worms can often be found underneath these heat collectors. 

The name &quot;slowworm&quot; is only contaminated by the word &quot;slow&quot;. In Middle English, it was written &quot;slowurm&quot;, from Old English &quot;slāwyrm&quot;, where &quot;slā-&quot; means &#x27;earthworm&#x27; or &#x27;slowworm&#x27; and &quot;wyrm&quot; means &quot;serpent, reptile&quot;. It is related to the Norwegian or Swedish , of same meaning.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot; was traditionally divided into two subspecies (&quot;A. f. fragilis&quot; and &quot;A. f. colchica&quot;), but they are now classified as separate species:

* Anguis fragilis&quot; &quot;sensu stricto (found in western Europe, northern Europe and western Balkans) and
* Anguis colchica (found in eastern and northern Europe, eastern Balkans and in western Asia).
Three more species were later distinguished from &quot;A. fragilis&quot;:
* Anguis graeca (found in southern Balkans) and
* Anguis veronensis (found on the Apennine Peninsula).
*Anguis cephalonica (native to the Peloponnese Peninsula)

== Physical traits ==

Slow worms have an elongated body with a circular cross-section without limbs and reach a maximum length of up to 57.5 cm. Most adult animals are between 40 and 45 cm long, with up to 22 cm on the head and trunk section and the rest on the tail. There is no visible neck. The tail, which ends in a horny tip, is continuous with the trunk and is often slightly longer. Slow worms exhibit caudal autotomy, the severing of the tail when it is pulled by predators. When regrown, the tail grows back only to a short stub, probably because loss of the tail does not sufficiently affect the species&#x27; locomotion, foraging and defence abilities to necessitate full and rapid regeneration.

The skin surface consists of smooth, round-to-hexagonal scales which do not overlap over one another and are roughly the same shape on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body. There are several longitudinal rows running along the underside. In total, the trunk has 125 to 150 transverse scale rows and the tail has another 130 to 160 rows. Under the scales there are bony plates (osteoderms), so that slow worms crawl much more stiffly and clumsily than snakes. The scaling of the head is similar to that of snakes. The ear openings are mostly completely hidden under the scales. The relatively small eyes have movable, closable eyelids (these are fused in snakes) and round pupils. The rather short tongue is broad, bilobed and does not end in fine tips. To lick, i.e. to absorb odorous substances, slow worms have to open their mouths slightly, as they lack the gap in the upper lip that snakes possess. The pointed, sometimes loosely fixed teeth are curved backwards; there are 7 to 9 teeth in the premaxilla, 10 to 12 in the maxilla and 14 to 16 in the lower jaw.

===Size and longevity===
Adult slow worms grow to be about 50 cm (20&quot;) long, and are known for their exceptionally long lives; the slow worm may be the longest-living lizard, living about 30 years in the wild and up to at least 54 years in captivity (this record is held by a male slow worm that lived at the Copenhagen Zoo from 1892 until 1946, the age when first obtained is unknown). The female often has a stripe along the spine and dark sides, while the male may have blue spots dorsally. Juveniles of both sexes are gold with dark brown bellies and sides with a dark stripe along the spine.

== Reproduction ==

In Central Europe, the mating season of the species is usually between late April and June. The males often wrestle violently around the females, although they are in the majority in most populations. The opponents try to push each other to the ground, bite each other and wrap themselves tightly around each other. When mating, the female is bitten in the head or neck region, while the male introduces his two hemipenes into the female&#x27;s cloaca. Copulation can take several hours. 

Sometimes, females mate with other males later. The gestation period of the females lasts 11 to 14 weeks, and subsequently, between mid-July and the end of August, and sometimes even later, they usually give birth to between eight and twelve young (extreme values: 2 to 28). Slow worms are ovoviviparous; at birth, the 7 to 10 cm long young animals are in a very thin, transparent egg shell, which they pierce immediately afterwards. They initially weigh less than a gram and still have a remnant of the yolk. Juvenile slow worms have a contrasting color scheme and pattern. The top of the body is silvery-white to golden yellow, while the sides and underside are black.

== Predators ==
Predators of &quot;A. fragilis&quot; include adders, badgers, birds of prey, crows, domestic cats, foxes, hedgehogs, pheasants and smooth snakes. Slow worms detect the presence of predators with their tongues by flicking them in and out to &#x27;smell&#x27;.

== Ecology ==
These reptiles are largely nocturnal and do not bask in the sun like other reptiles, but choose to warm themselves indirectly underneath objects, such as rocks, which have been warmed by the sun. They can often be found in long grass and other damp environments In a 2009 study of a Danish population, the diet of the slow-worm was found to include slugs, snails, earthworms, caterpillars and pill millipedes.

==Protected status in the UK==
In the United Kingdom, the slow worm has been granted protected status, alongside all other native British reptile species. The slow worm population has been decreasing, and under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, to intentionally kill, injure, sell, or advertise to sell them is illegal.

==Ireland==
The slow worm is assumed to be non-native in Ireland, possibly arriving in the 1900s. Due to their secretive habits they are difficult to observe and are sighted only in parts of County Clare and possibly County Galway, mainly in the Burren region.

== Evolutionary history ==
Members of the genus &quot;Anguis&quot;, to which the slow worm belongs, first appeared in Europe during the Mammal Paleogene zone 14, between 43.5 and 41.2 million years ago, corresponding to the Lutetian stage of the Eocene. Remains assigned to the &quot;Anguis fragilis&quot; species complex are known from the late Miocene onwards.

<doc id="805802" wikidata="Q634179" url="?curid=805802" title="Breakpoint">
<text>In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause.

More generally, a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution. During the interruption, the programmer inspects the test environment (general-purpose registers, memory, logs, files, etc.) to find out whether the program is functioning as expected. In practice, a breakpoint consists of one or more conditions that determine when a program&#x27;s execution should be interrupted.

==History==
Breakpoints were invented for ENIAC, one of the earliest digital computers, by programmer Betty Holberton. In the initial design of ENIAC, program flow was set by plugging cables from one unit to another. To make the program stop at a certain point, a cable was removed, called a &quot;breakpoint&quot;.

==Types of breakpoints==
=== Machine breakpoints ===
Early mainframe computers, such as the IBM/360, had console switches/dials that allowed breakpoints at specific instruction storage addresses and provided &quot;single cycle&quot; operation, permitting the contents of registers and memory to be observed directly on console lights. The advent of multitasking limited the use of this option since the entire machine was halted.

=== Non-interactive breakpoints ===
Programmers have used machine code patches to implement single destructive breakpoints to cause a core dump since the early days of computers. The core dump provided the state of the registers and memory at the exact moment of the deliberate &quot;crash&quot;.

=== Interactive breakpoints ===
The advent of teletypewriter consoles in the 1960s allowed more interactive command line debugging capabilities but it was not until the early 1970s and the arrival of ubiquitous video monitors connected to mainframes that fully interactive, full screen debugging in multitasking environments became a reality. This also permitted step-by-step program execution in a true program animation manner with optional register and memory alterations simultaneously displayed. Initially this type of animation was at the level of disassembled or decompiled machine code, but later advanced to HLL source level animation.

===Conditional breakpoints===
Breakpoints are most commonly used to interrupt a running program immediately before the execution of a programmer-specified instruction. This is often referred to as an &quot;instruction breakpoint&quot;.

Other kinds of conditions can also be used, such as the reading, writing, or modification of a specific location in an area of memory. This is often referred to as a &quot;data breakpoint&quot;, or a &quot;watchpoint&quot;. Many systems also support breakpoints that are only active if a condition is met (such as a variable having a certain value), usually referred to as &quot;conditional breakpoint&quot;.

===Inspection tools===
When a breakpoint is hit, various tools are used to inspect the state of the program or alter it. Stack trace of each thread may be used to see the chain of function calls that led to the paused instruction. A list of &quot;watches&quot; allows one to view the values of selected variables and expressions. There may also be tools to show the contents of registers, loaded program modules and other information.

===Logpoints===
A &quot;logpoint&quot; is a type of breakpoint that only prints (or &quot;logs&quot;) information instead of interrupting execution. Usually the developer can specify a message and/or values of variables to print when execution reaches a specific point.
Logpoints are an alternative to putting logging statements into the program being debugged (sometimes called &quot;printf debugging&quot;), and particularly helpful when changing the program is not practical (for example when debugging an external library called by the program).

==Implementations==

===Hardware===
Many processors include hardware support for breakpoints (typically instruction and data breakpoints). As an example, the x86 instruction set architecture provides hardware support for breakpoints with its x86 debug registers. Such hardware may include limitations, for example not allowing breakpoints on instructions located in branch delay slots. This kind of limitation is imposed by the microarchitecture of the processor and varies from processor to processor.

===Software===
Without hardware support (and in multitasking environments), debuggers have to implement breakpoints in software. For instruction breakpoints, this is a comparatively simple task of replacing the instruction at the location of the breakpoint by either:
* an instruction that calls the debugger directly (e.g. a system call, or int3 in case of x86) or
* an invalid instruction that causes a deliberate program interrupt (that is then intercepted/handled by the debugger)

This technique may be more difficult to implement in multitasking systems using shared program storage (the interrupt may occur on a different thread, requiring resurrection of the original instruction for that thread). Also, if the program resides in protected memory, overwriting of instructions may be prevented.

Alternatively, 
* an instruction set simulator can implement unconditional or conditional breakpoints, by simply embedding the appropriate condition tests within its own normal program cycle – that also naturally allows non-invasive breakpoints (on read-only programs for instance).
* Interpreted languages can effectively use the same concept as above in their program cycle.
* &quot;Instrumenting&quot; all the source code with additional source statements that issue a function that invokes an internal or external debug subroutine, is yet another common approach. This method increases the binary size and might adversely affect normal memory allocation and exception handlers. &quot;Debug&quot; options exist on some compilers to implement this technique semi-transparently.

Some debuggers allow registers or program variables in memory to be modified before resuming, effectively allowing the introduction of &quot;hand-coded&quot; temporary assignments for test purposes. Similarly, program instructions can often be skipped to determine the effect of changes to the program logic – enabling questions about program execution to be answered in a direct way (i.e. without assumptions or guesswork). In many cases it may be the only practical method of testing obscure &quot;event-driven&quot; error subroutines that rarely, if ever, get executed – without the added risk of leaving temporary source changes. Manually changing the resume location within a paused program can be used to enter an otherwise rarely executed section of code (such as a specific hardware condition handler).
Implementing data breakpoints in software however, can greatly reduce the performance of the application being debugged – since it is using additional resources on the same processor. However, this is normally acceptable during testing and the amount of information available from the debugger is not restricted by limitations of debug data known to the hardware. For instance, a software implementation can collect logical path data at program/subroutine/instruction level to considerably augment what might be stored by the particular hardware platform for inspection. The instruction set simulation method considerably reduces the overhead, compared to the (repeated) instruction replacement method, also reducing cache misses.

Some programming language implementations expose their debugging functions for use by other programs.
For example, some FORTRAN dialects have an codice_1 statement, which was originally intended to act as an instruction breakpoint.
Python implements a debugger accessible from a Python program.
These facilities can be and are abused to act like the COMEFROM statement.

<text>Henri-Alban Fournier (; 3 October 1886 – 22 September 1914), known by the pseudonym Alain-Fournier (), was a French author and soldier. He was the author of a single novel, &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; (1913), which has been filmed twice and is considered a classic of French literature. The book is based partly on his childhood.

==Biography==
Alain-Fournier was born in La Chapelle-d&#x27;Angillon, in the Cher &quot;département&quot;, in central France, the son of school teachers. Everyone who knew him called him &quot;Henri&quot;, his first name or &quot;Fournier&quot;, his last name, as &quot;Alain-Fournier&quot; was merely a nom-de-plume. He had a younger sister, Isabelle, to whom he was very close. She was one of his first readers, his confidante and most constant friend and support-system throughout his life. 

He studied at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris, where he prepared for the entrance examination to the École Normale Supérieure. He met there fellow student Jacques Rivière, and the two became close friends, though it took a while as Henri&#x27;s rebellious and playful nature first kept Jacques at bay. He was then the leader of a group of boys who were fighting against hazing, and circulating revolutionary petitions. About their growing friendship, Jacques Rivière wrote: ”Underneath his untamed exterior, I found him to be tender, naive, filled with a sweet, dreamy sap, even infinitely more vulnerable than me, which is saying something, in the face of life&quot;. The two of them had long and insightful talks and shared the same sensitivity and love for words and poetry, especially the Symbolist movement. 

In early 1905, he started to write poems such as ”L’ondée&quot; (The shower) and &quot;Conte du soleil et de la route&quot; (Tale of the sun and the road). He shared them with his sister Isabelle, who loved them and wrote him: ”Only in you have I truly sensed a strong and ardent soul, a poet’s soul, someone who suffers and feels; a bare soul, stripped from all these things that spoil and darken all the others, and only with you have I felt that I was really me, that I could show everything, that you would understand everything&quot;. 

On the first of June 1905, while he was taking a stroll along the banks of the Seine, Henri saw Yvonne de Quièvrecourt as she was walking in the other direction. He was amazed and followed her aboard a river boat and in the streets, to the house she was staying at. He came back there a few times in the following days, hoping to meet her. Ten days later, on 11 June, he finally had his chance as she was going out on her own. He followed her again aboard a streetcar, inside a church and in the streets, until he plucked up the courage to talk to her. Yvonne first rebuffed him, but he eventually won her trust, and they walked and talked together. This moment was faithfully fictionalized in Le Grand Meaulnes, when Augustin Meaulnes meets Yvonne De Galais for the first time. Yvonne (who was actually engaged) ended up mysteriously saying: &quot;We are children, we acted foolishly&quot; and asked Henri to not follow her again as she was leaving, though, a few steps further, she turned around to look at him for a long time before disappearing in the crowd. A few days later, Henri put his recollection of these moments on paper in great detail. 

During the same summer, Henri Fournier spent a few weeks in London, where he was doing translation work in a wallpaper factory. He attended a garden-party in Chiswick that later served as an inspiration for Frantz De Galais&#x27; wedding party in &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;. Though he met several young English girls who were eager to spend time with him, he couldn&#x27;t keep his mind off Yvonne and kept to himself. In letters, he started to confide in Jacques Rivière about her, stating: &quot;I wish I could talk to you about her, whose face suddenly came back the other night with a frightening clarity to stir me to my heart, to stir me until I cried. I believe it is not only a little romantic episode&quot;. He also wrote and shared with him his latest poem &quot;A travers les étés&quot; (From summer to summer), that tells the tale of their encounter.

Back in Paris from 1905 to 1907 to finish his studies, Henri Fournier expressed in letters how oppressed he felt, that his studies and the idea of pursuing a career became meaningless to him, and that he felt unable to please his parents in that regard. He wrote to Jacques: ”Since I got here, there is like something suffocating me. I am fighting with all I have to pick up this courage and confidence that fell down. It’s hard and dark and inexplicable&quot;. With Isabelle, he shared: ”This exam doesn’t speak to me. Far from being an ideal, it’s not even a temporary goal or a first step to make. From now on, I can’t bring myself to use my brain for this. […] My life doesn’t lie in studying until cerebral exhaustion. I am looking for my life. My only regret is for my parents. Since a long time, I have ceased to see through their eyes. And I will not fulfill their ideal, that they spent much money on&quot;. 
During these same years, he was often coming back to wait in front of the house where he saw Yvonne the previous year (though she never returned) and in January 1906, he wrote his poem &quot;Et maintenant que c’est la pluie&quot; (And now that it&#x27;s raining) about these moments and his longing for her. 
On 1 June 1906, he came back at the very same place he first saw Yvonne, waiting for her as he hoped that she was also looking for him, but she did not appear.
In 1907, Henri failed his competitive exam. He had suffered several brain fevers in the previous months due to exhaustion, and he was cognitively impaired and fell asleep during the test. He contemplated becoming a sailor as he loved the ocean, but he didn&#x27;t follow through, as he had reservations about the work environment. During that same summer, he finally learned that Yvonne was married and he was heartbroken over it, expressing in letters his feeling of new-found utter aloneness. Jacques Rivière was just back from his military service and was able to help him through it, taking him to spend vacations among his own family.

From 1907 to 1909, Henri Fournier performed his military service. At this time, he also published some essays, poems and stories, which were later collected and re-published by the name &quot;Miracles&quot;. He vividly expressed in many letters to his friends and family how much he was struggling with depression, hopelessness and anxiety during his mandatory time in the army, and how broken and traumatized he felt even as he returned. He became a literary critic, writing for the &quot;Paris-Journal&quot;. There he met André Gide and Paul Claudel. However, he wasn&#x27;t satisfied with his job and he was struggling with society&#x27;s expectations against his own dreams, and the constant fear of wasting his youth. 
His sister Isabelle and Jacques Rivière had met in 1907 when Jacques stayed with their family for a few weeks, they had soon fallen in love and they married in 1909. Henri was then living with them (and his and Isabelle&#x27;s parents) up to 1910. The three of them were enjoying Paris&#x27; effervescent artistic life together, though Isabelle and Jacques worried about Henri&#x27;s state of mind, which especially showed in the way he seemed unable to start doing anything. He and Jacques argued about it over letters, which somewhat caused a rift between them as Henri felt generally misunderstood.
He shared in several letters experiences that clearly show his emotional distress at the time, such as getting lost while on his way home and feeling like a stranger in a strange land, or spending all day wandering in the rain and having nightmares at night where he couldn&#x27;t recognize his house and no one could hear him call out for help. 

In 1910, he started a two-year on-and-off relationship with Jeanne Bruneau, a country-born milliner who inspired him the character of Valentine in &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;. Their romance almost ended soon after they met, when Jeanne confided in him about former relationships, and that remained the object of several arguments and break-ups between them. He wrote her several romantic and passionate letters which show how much he wanted to share with her his ideal about love and hoped to teach her how to believe in true love the way he did. Though their situation was unusual as they weren&#x27;t married or engaged (he actually first hid it from them altogether), he introduced her to Isabelle (alongside his beloved niece Jacqueline) and Jacques (who later revealed to Isabelle that she didn&#x27;t say a word or even look at him), and he contemplated marrying her, but they eventually parted ways, mostly because he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to propose to anyone but Yvonne and he felt that Jeanne didn&#x27;t manage to fully understand and enter the fairy world he carried with him as he wrote to her: &quot;Part of my life takes place in this other world, a world filled with imagination and childish paradises. Those who know me very well are aware of that. From several women, already, I hoped that they would be able to go there with me. None ever did&quot;.

In 1911, he gave French lessons to fellow poet T. S. Eliot who was then staying in Paris.
In 1912, he quit his job to become the personal assistant of the politician Casimir Perrier. 
He started writing &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; in 1910, at his parents&#x27; house. He then wrote to Jacques and Isabelle: &quot;For two weeks, I tried to artificially construct this book as I had started. It wasn’t going anywhere. Eventually, I threw it all away and […] I started to write simply, directly, like one of my letters. I threw away all this abstraction and this philosophy I was tangled with. And the most amazing thing is that there’s still everything, all of me&quot;. &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; was finished in early 1913, and was published first in the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; (from July to October 1913) and then as a book, which was nominated for, but did not win, the Prix Goncourt. It was dedicated to his sister Isabelle.

The same year, Henri finally found Yvonne&#x27;s trail again, as Jacques Rivière&#x27;s younger brother Marc was studying medicine in Rochefort, the town where her family lived. Marc was in the know since Henri and him had met in 1907, and he brought it up when he was introduced to Yvonne&#x27;s younger sister. Henri and Yvonne were then able to meet again for a couple days, as she was visiting her family. She introduced him to her mother, her sister and her children, and they could talk about their first encounter and what it meant to them. Henri also showed her a letter he wrote for her the previous year, expressing his love and faithfulness and telling her that his then upcoming novel, &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; was all about her.

In 1914, Alain-Fournier started to work on a second novel, &quot;Colombe Blanchet&quot;, but this remained unfinished when he had to join the Army as a lieutenant that August. He died fighting near Vaux-lès-Palameix (Meuse) one month later, on 22 September 1914. His body remained unidentified until 1991, at which time he was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Remy-la-Calonne. According to some sources, the patrol which Alain-Fournier was part of received the order to &quot;shoot at German soldiers encountered unexpectedly and who were stretcher-bearers&quot;; the patrol obeyed, which the Germans would have considered a violation of international conventions. According to , professor at the University of Düsseldorf, it is correct that Alain-Fournier&#x27;s patrol attacked a German ambulance, but it is difficult to establish the precise facts.

Most of the writing of Alain-Fournier was published posthumously: &quot;Miracles&quot; (a volume of poems and essays) in 1924, his correspondence with Jacques Rivière in 1926 and his letters to his family in 1930. His notes and sketches for &quot;Colombe Blanchet&quot; have also been published.

==Albin Schram manuscripts==
A correspondence between Alain-Fournier and an unidentified woman was found in the collection of Albin Schram. It is a grateful letter for her introduction to a Monsieur Hébrard and refers to his next work:

&quot;Il m&#x27;a proposé pour&quot; Le Temps &quot;ce qu&#x27;il était le plus logique de me proposer: lui apporter mon prochain roman—ce que j&#x27;ai promis bien volontiers. Ce second roman est, pour l&#x27;instant un peu retardé par une nouvelle oeuvre qui s&#x27;est mise au travers de ma route et qui ne me laisse pas beaucoup de répit. Mais j&#x27;espère bien avant la fin de l&#x27;année avoir terminé&quot; Colombe Blanchet.

He has proposed to me for &quot;Le Temps&quot; that which was the most logical thing to propose to me: to bring him my next novel—which I have promised quite willingly. This second novel is, for the moment, somewhat delayed by a new work which has placed itself across my path and which doesn&#x27;t leave me much respite. But I hope well before the end of the year to have finished &quot;Colombe Blanchet&quot;.

==AJRAF==
In 1975, L&#x27;Association des Amis de Jacques Rivière et d&#x27;Alain-Fournier (AJRAF, Association of the Friends of Jacques Rivière and of Alain-Fournier) was founded by Alain Rivière, the son of Jacques Rivière and nephew of Alain-Fournier, to &quot;promote knowledge of these two authors and to gather their friends together&quot;.

<doc id="805814" wikidata="Q2981417" url="?curid=805814" title="Code 93">
<text>Code 93 is a barcode symbology designed in 1982 by Intermec to provide a higher density and data security enhancement to Code 39. It is an alphanumeric, variable length symbology. Code 93 is used primarily by Canada Post to encode supplementary delivery information. Every symbol includes two check characters.

Each Code 93 character is nine modules wide, and always has three bars and three spaces, thus the name. Each bar and space is from 1 to 4 modules wide. (For comparison, a Code 39 character consists of five bars and four spaces, three of which are wide, for a total width of 13–16 modules.)

Code 93 is designed to encode the same 26 upper case letters, 10 digits and 7 special characters as code 39:

: codice_1
: codice_2
: codice_3

In addition to 43 characters, Code 93 defines 5 special characters (including a start/stop character), which can be combined with other characters to unambiguously represent all 128 ASCII characters.

In an open system, the minimum value of X dimension is 7.5 mils (0.19 mm). The minimum bar height is 15 percent of the symbol length or , whichever is greater. The starting and trailing quiet zone should be at least .

== Structure of a code 93 barcode ==

A typical code 93 barcode has the following structure:

* A start character *
* Encoded message
* First modulo-47 check character &quot;C&quot;
* Second modulo-47 check character &quot;K&quot;
* Stop character *
* Termination bar

== Detailed outline ==
The 48 possible code-93 symbols are as follows. There are actually formula_1 = 56 combinations that satisfy the coding rules, but one would be confused with the stop symbol in reverse, and the other 7 are unused. Codes 43–46 can be prefixed to alphanumeric values to produce all 128 possible ASCII codes. This is done in exactly the same way as Full ASCII Code 39, but uses reserved codes rather than re-using codes 39–42.

== Full ASCII Code 93 ==

Code 93 is restricted to 43 characters and 5 special characters. In Full ASCII Code 93, the 43 basic symbols (0–9, A-Z, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;+&quot; and &quot;%&quot;) are the same as their representations in Code 93. Lower case letters, additional punctuation characters and control characters are represented by sequences of two characters of Code 93.

This encoding is the same as Full ASCII Code 39, except that four special-purpose symbols are used, rather than reassigning $, /, + and %:

<doc id="805830" wikidata="Q3777604" url="?curid=805830" title="1918 Dutch general election">
<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 3 July 1918. They were the first elections held after a series of reforms that introduced universal male suffrage and pure proportional representation, replacing the previous two-round system in single member constituencies. This change was known as the Pacification of 1917, which also included the introduction of state financing of religious schools, and led to the start of consociational democracy.

The change in the electoral system led to major changes in the political makeup of the House of Representatives. The confessional right-wing parties, the General League of Roman Catholic Electoral Associations, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Christian Historical Union, together won 50 seats.

The liberal parties lost the most seats. While in 1917, two of the liberal parties, the Liberal Union and the League of Free Liberals, had won 31 seats, they were now reduced to 10 seats. Together with three smaller liberal parties, liberals now held only 15 seats in the House of representatives.

The fragmentation of the House was caused by the low electoral threshold of just 0.5%, with the smallest party, the Alliance to Democratise the Forces, managing to win a seat with only 6,828 votes.

The elections were the first in which Dutch women could stand for election, despite still not being allowed to vote. Suze Groeneweg was elected as the first female member of the House of Representatives.

<doc id="805831" wikidata="Q314262" url="?curid=805831" title="Breakpoint (demoparty)">
<text>Breakpoint was an annual demoscene party held in Bingen, Germany during Easter from 2003 to 2010. The successor to Mekka &amp; Symposium, an annual German demoscene party that had ended in 2002, Breakpoint grew to become the largest annual event focused solely on the demoscene. It attained over 1000 visitors at its height, attracting demosceners from Germany, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Spain, Australia, and Canada, among others. It was also the host of the Scene.org Awards ceremony from 2003 to 2010.

==History==
===Background===
Mekka &amp; Symposium had been an annual demoscene party held in Fallingbostel, Germany from 1996 to 2002. Hosting of the event ended in 2002 following internal tensions among its organizing team. Later that year, several former members of the Mekka &amp; Symposium organizing team announced the creation of Breakpoint as a successor demoscene party in collaboration with other German demoscene party organizers, including ones from Dialogos, Evoke, and the Ultimate Meeting. It would held annually during Easter at an abandoned military depot in Bingen, a small town near Frankfurt.

===Early years (2003–2006)===
The inaugural Breakpoint 2003 event was a success among the demosceners who attended, with both veterans and newcomers praising its atmosphere and freedom. Although criticisms of the party were minor, the failure of one of the building&#x27;s heating pipes led to the event being dubbed &quot;Freezepoint&quot; by a parody demo. The event was also hosted the inaugural Scene.org Awards ceremony.

ATI Technologies became the main sponsor of Breakpoint starting in 2004, providing the event with funding for prizes, seminars, workshops, and a helicopter flight over the hills of the Rhineland. While the event was a success, the inability to resolve the building&#x27;s heating issues from the year prior deterred a number of visitors. Due to the deteriorating state of the military depot building, it was scheduled for demolition by the German government later that year.

Due to the demolition of its original venue, Breakpoint 2005 was moved to the Bingen city gym, a choice some demoscene members feared would diminish the atmosphere of the event, including the loss of its symbolic bonfire. The event proved to be a success nonetheless, with seminars, demo releases, and four live demoscene music concerts occurring in the heated, carpeted room of the new venue. It was later voted as the &quot;Best Alltime Demoparty&quot; in the PAiN diskmag.

Breakpoint 2006 was given a jungle setting—its venue adorned with torches, rocks, skeletons, and vines—to contextualize sceners competing to search for and regain their scene spirit. The event featured the annual Scene.org Awards ceremony in a much more formal and ceremonial setting, along with seminars and live music, including a performance by .

===Later years (2007–2010)===
As a result of AMD&#x27;s acquisition of ATI Technologies in July 2006, Intel became the primary sponsor of Breakpoint 2007, rather than secondary as it had been in prior years. Left with a deficit in its budget to host the 2007 iteration of Breakpoint, the event&#x27;s organizers raised the entrance fee to 60 euros and abandoned its tradition of allowing women to attend the event for free. Despite the financial challenges, Breakpoint 2007 featured the usual array of competitions and seminars, along with live music from BASS and the Danish Commodore revival band Press Play On Tape. The Scene.org Awards ceremony was restructured with shorter screening times to reduce its length.

Breakpoint 2008 added Nvidia as a major sponsor, allowing event organizers to lower the entrance fee to €55 and acquire two 1080p projectors to screen demos on a screen. Nvidia did not return as a sponsor for the 2009 iteration of Breakpoint, leaving it without a major sponsor to cover the majority of costs. Although donations and the sale of €250 supporter tickets made up for some of the lost windfall and enabled regular tickets to remain at €55, Breakpoint 2009 lacked features such as seminars due to budgetary constraints. 20th Century Fox was added as a major sponsor for the event on short notice, resulting in the inclusion of a contest for demos, videos, art, and music featuring the character Wolverine as a means of promoting the film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. While Breakpoint was unable pay performers, Xerxes, Romeo Knight, and Bendik returned to perform in a free concert.

Breakpoint 2010 was the final Breakpoint event, holding a record attendance of over a thousand visitors. As the last day of the event coincided with NASA&#x27;s launch of the STS-131 space shuttle, the launch was streamed at the event prior to the award ceremony.

===Successor===
Several months after the Breakpoint&#x27;s conclusion, a successor demoparty entitled &quot;Revision&quot; was announced. Launching the following year in the same Easter time window as its predecessor, Revision would be hosted in Saarbrücken, Germany by an organizing team consisting mostly of former Breakpoint organizers.

<doc id="805838" wikidata="Q312956" url="?curid=805838" title="Yuriy Sedykh">
<text>Yuriy Georgiyevich Sedykh (, ) (11 June 1955 – 14 September 2021) was a track and field athlete who represented the Soviet Union from 1976 to 1991 in the hammer throw. He was a European, World and Olympic Champion, and holds the world record with a throw of 86.74 m in 1986.

== Career ==
Sedykh was born in Novocherkassk, Russia, and grew up in Nikopol, Ukraine. He took up track and field in 1967 under coach Vladimir Ivanovich Volovik. He trained at Burevestnik and later at the Armed Forces sports society in Kyiv, attaining the rank of major in the Soviet Army. From 1972 he was coached by Anatoliy Bondarchuk, who is widely regarded as one of the best hammer coaches in the world. In 1973 he became a member of the USSR National Junior Team.

=== Competition ===
Sedykh won gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics and 1980 Summer Olympics as well as taking first at the 1986 Goodwill Games. He set a world record of 86.74 m at the 1986 European championships in Stuttgart, where he won his third title in a row. He also came first at the 1991 World Championships. Only Sedykh and Sergey Litvinov have thrown over 86 meters in the history of the sport (Ivan Tsikhan&#x27;s 86.73 m throw in 2005 was annulled by the IAAF in April 2014 due to doping sanctions).

Sedykh&#x27;s 1986 world record has been noted for its longevity, and for dating from &quot;a time when track and field was starting to realize the scale of performance-enhancing drug use&quot; (AP). In his 2020 book &quot;The Rodchenkov Affair&quot;, Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov stated that Sedykh was a heavy user of steroids; Sedykh denied allegations of doping.

=== Coaching ===
Sedykh coached French hammer throwers, for example Nicolas Figère (80.88 m).

== Technique ==
Unlike many throwers, Sedykh employed three rotations rather than four. He often practised with lighter and heavier hammers. His technique was based on &#x27;pushing&#x27; the ball left and letting the hammer turn him.

== Personal life ==
Previously married to Soviet 100 m Olympic champion Lyudmila Kondratyeva, Sedykh subsequently married former Soviet shot-putter and world-record holder Natalya Lisovskaya who won gold in the 1988 Olympics. They had one daughter, Alexia, born in 1993, who came first in the girls&#x27; hammer throw at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore. Sedykh and his family moved to Paris, France, where he taught strength and conditioning at higher education level. Sedykh died in France on 14 September 2021 at the age of 66. The urn with the ashes was buried in the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery&#x27;s Pantheon of Defenders of the Fatherland&quot; in Mytishchi, Russia.

<text>Hans Helfritz (25 July 1902, Chemnitz – 21 October 1995, Duisburg) was a German composer and photographer. 

==Biography==
Owing to pressure from his parents, Helfritz originally began an apprenticeship as a banker, a career path he soon gave up in order to study music and composition in Berlin and Vienna. Inspired by his teacher Erich von Hornbostel in 1930, he travelled to Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Iraq to collect samples of folk music for his research. In 1935 he continued his travels to India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Republic of China and Singapore.

Helfritz also made films about Yemen and Mexico as an assignment for Ufa. In these films he deliberately evaded the right-wing line of Joseph Goebbels of presenting foreign ethnicities as culturally inferior.

In 1939 Helfritz fled Germany because of his homosexuality and political beliefs which meant he was labelled an enemy of the Nazi state. He fled first to Brazil and Bolivia, before settling in Chile. He continued to work, taking part in the Chilean Antarctic Expedition as the official photographer. At the end of the 1940s he received Chilean citizenship. Throughout the 1950s Helfritz explored Central America and West Africa from an archaeological perspective. Later he changed profession, working first as a tour guide in these regions, then as travel lecturer. In 1959 he settled down in Ibiza.

<text>Miss Robin Hood is a 1952 British second feature (&#x27;B&#x27;) comedy film directed by John Guillermin and starring Margaret Rutherford and Richard Hearne. It was written by Val Valentine and Patrick Campbell from a story by Reed De Rouen.

==Plot==
A writer named Wrigley creates a comic strip character named Miss Robin Hood for a children&#x27;s story paper. It is a modernized retelling of the Robin Hood legend in which the heroine robs banks with the assistance of a gang of teenage girls and then redistributes the money.

Unfortunately the cartoon is dropped from the paper, and Wrigley leaves his job. However, Miss Honey, who is director of a home for the orphans of London in Hampstead, recruits Wrigley to carry out a little light safebreaking, believing that he has such skills because he created Miss Robin Hood. Difficulties arise when Scotland Yard becomes involved.

==Cast==
==Production==
Filming took place in June 1952. The film features a variety of unusual camera work such as unexpected extreme close-ups and fast motion sequences. Disney were making &quot;The Story of Robin Hood&quot; and were reportedly unhappy that the Group 3 film could be confused with theirs. 

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;This new production from Group 3 is a haphazard mixture of farce and fantasy. ... A few authentically comic moments, and an exuberant hit-or-miss approach, do something to sustain the film, but the humour ... too often seems merely juvenile. Margaret Rutherford, playing the strange Miss Honey with a Robin Hood outfit and a hockey captain vocabulary, makes the character almost excessively grotesque, and the mild Richard Hearne might be happier in a more conventional type of comedy. Lack of discipline in both script and direction is, however, responsible for most of the shortcomings of this slapdash and undergraduatish piece.&quot;

&quot;Kine Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;There are a few bright satirical touches, but most of its fun is fourth form. ... The picture, which gives Margaret Rutherford her head, tries desperately hard to be both clever and funny, but few of its arrows hit their targets. Richard Hearne, who, by the way, deserves a more rational vehicle, introduces a pleasing touch of whimsy, but, like most other members of the cast, is soon swept off his feet by the script. It is more wild than witty.&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Even with stalwart Margaret Rutherford playing the principal role – that of a good-natured looney – in this utterly slap-happy film, and even with several cheering flashes of tomfoolery to light the way, the whole thing is just a bit too labored – too fatuous – to be continuous fun.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: &quot;This disappointing comedy gave the much loved Margaret Rutherford a rare chance to star. Considering the infectious enthusiasm of her performance as the mischievous Miss Honey, she deserved better material than slight skirmish with a gang of crooks over a valuable whisky recipe. There are solid turns from Sid James and James Robertson-Justice, but writers Val Valentine and Patrick Campbell have over diluted the mixture for most tastes.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Disappointing star comedy with no build-up.&quot;

In &quot;British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959&quot; David Quinlan rated the film as &quot;mediocre&quot;, writing: &quot;Would-be Ealing-style comedy is too silly for words.&quot;

Graeme Clark of the website &quot;The Spinning Image&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s all very fluffy and inconsequential, but with Patrick Campbell contributing to the script and this array of talent in front of the camera, vintage Brit comedy fans are well catered for.&quot;

&quot;Filmink&quot; said &quot;It has a decent enough central idea ... but it doesn’t have enough faith in the idea, so all this other extraneous stuff is added.&quot;

<text>Photuris is a genus of fireflies (beetles of the family Lampyridae). These are the &quot;[[femme fatale]]&quot; lightning bugs of North America. This common name refers to a behavior of the adult females of these predatory beetles; they engage in aggressive mimicry, imitating the light signals of other firefly species&#x27; females to attract matesbut &quot;Photuris&quot; use it to attract, kill and eat the unsuspecting males of those other species. Their flashing bioluminescent signals seem to have evolved independently and eventually adapted to those of their prey, mainly unrelated Lampyrinae, such as &quot;Photinus&quot; (rover fireflies) or &quot;Pyractomena&quot;.

==Species==
At least 64 species are currently recognized, all restricted to temperate North America. They mainly occur from the East Coast to Texas. Species include:
*&quot;Photuris bethaniensis&quot;– 
*&quot; – 
*&quot;– 
*&quot;Photuris fairchildi&quot;– 
*&quot;Photuris floridana&quot; –

<text>Infantry, also known as Infantry Online, is a multiplayer combat video game. Originally released in 1999, the game was taken offline by Sony Online Entertainment and the servers shut down in March 2012. The &quot;Infantry&quot; community subsequently took control of the game and re-launched it independently at freeinfantry.com.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Infantry Online&quot; uses sprite animation graphics to model complex soldier, ground vehicle and space-ship models on typically complex terrains. Players may choose from a list of game zones to enter, each zone having a unique style of gameplay and many offering a wide diversity of weapons, player classes and objectives.

==History ==
In 1997, the now-defunct development team Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE) released the 2D space shooter, &quot;SubSpace&quot;. Members of the &quot;SubSpace&quot; development formed Harmless Games LLC and developed &quot;Infantry&quot; during the late 1990s. Brainscan Development Corporation, also known as Brainscan Interactive, became publisher until GameFan, the parent company of Brainscan Interactive, went bankrupt.

By October 2000 Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) began an acquisition of &quot;Infantry&quot;. Harmless Games, and its sole game, &quot;Infantry&quot;, was bought by SOE from Brainscan Interactive for an undisclosed sum. The lead designer Rodvik Humble, together with other developers, was offered a job with SOE to continue development of the game. &quot;Cosmic Rift&quot;, meant to compete with the still popular &quot;SubSpace&quot;, was developed as an offshoot of &quot;Infantry&quot;.

In May 2002, SOE introduced a monthly $6.95 pay-to-play system for SOE&#x27;s three small action games: &quot;Infantry&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Rift&quot; and &quot;Tanarus&quot;, but both &quot;Infantry&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Rift&quot; remained free to play with limitations.

Starting in June 2007, SOE gave full and free online gaming access to &quot;Infantry&quot; and the rest of their &quot;Station Pass&quot; games. 

Sony Online Entertainment shut down the &quot;Infantry Online&quot; servers at the end of March 2012.

The majority of their fanbase is from the district of Nowa Huta and club has 3 fan-clubs: Igołomia&amp;Pobiednik, Szczyrzyc, Górale (which compromises of fans from Zakopane and Nowy Targ).

In recent years the team has spent much of its time in the lower divisions unlike their neighbouring rivals, and the city derbies have usually been played against the reserve teams. As a result, they have developed rivalries with other teams such as Unia Tarnów, and Resovia Rzeszów, as well as KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and Stal Stalowa Wola with whom they contest the Steelworks derbies.

The fans have friendly relations with fans of 1.FC Magdeburg, which started after one of the Magdeburg fans logged onto a Hutnik fan forum. They also have good relations with fans of Stomil Olsztyn and Wisła Płock. There are also some friendly contacts with fans of Dynamo Kyiv.

<text>Roger Anthony Black (born 31 March 1966) is an English former athlete who competed internationally for Great Britain and England. During his athletics career, he won individual silver medals in the 400 metres sprint at both the Olympic Games and World Championships, two individual gold medals at the European Championships, and 4 × 400 metres relay gold medals at both the World and European Championships.

Since retiring from athletics, he has worked as a television presenter and motivational speaker. In 2008, Black joined forces with fellow athlete Steve Backley and founded BackleyBlack LLP. Black has a collection of fifteen medals from major senior athletics competitions to add to his two European junior championship gold medals.

Black won five national outdoor championships at 400 metres, and one at 200 metres. As of July 2022, Black remains ranked joint third in the all-time Great Britain lists for the 400 metres.

==Early life==

He was born in Gosport, Hampshire, to David (a doctor) and Thelma, with a twin sister Julia. He attended Alverstoke Church of England Primary School and Portsmouth Grammar School, becoming Head Boy in 1983/84. It was whilst playing football with a local team (RPFC) that he began demonstrating his prowess as a runner, scoring numerous goals as a flying forward leaving many defenders in his wake. He then joined athletics clubs, re-took one of his A-level exams and began studying medicine at the University of Southampton, but he left his course after three months as he had begun to achieve success as an athlete.

==Athletics career==

Black rose to prominence in 1985 when he won the European Junior Championships 400 m in a time of 45.43 at the age of 19.

In 1986, Black graduated to the senior ranks and made a spectacular impact first winning at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in 45.57, and then at the European Championships in Stuttgart, winning in a time of 44.59, his first British Record, breaking Derek Redmond&#x27;s 44.82 record from the previous year. Having also won golds in both 4 × 400 m relays at both of those events as well, Black&#x27;s 1986 season had turned into a gold rush of four gold medals.

His next three seasons were wiped out through illness and injuries and he only just made the relay team for the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where the GB team won the silver medal. He returned to the track in 1990 and his good form took him to the European Championships again, which were held in Split. Black contested the 400 m final and retained his title with a time of 45.11, holding off his old rival Thomas Schönlebe. He then anchored the GB team to an easy 4 × 400 m victory winning by a margin of 15 metres, and a European record of 2:58.23, with his split time of 43.9. He thus achieved a rare double-double – two gold medals at consecutive championships.

Black&#x27;s outstanding 1990 season was followed by the 1991 World Championship season holding much expectation. His early season form at Crystal Palace saw him beat Olympic Champion Steve Lewis and Antonio Pettigrew but only to lose to Michael Johnson. Johnson would not contest the 400 m at the World Championships meaning the 400 m would be a contest between Black, Pettigrew and Danny Everett as the main contenders.

Black finished second in the individual 400 m in Tokyo to Antonio Pettigrew. Black put in his effort on the third 100 m and entered the home straight two metres up on Pettigrew. He then tired and was caught on the line. Pettigrew&#x27;s time was 44.57 and Black finished in 44.62. Everett also nearly caught Black on the line; his time was 44.63.

Pettigrew later admitted the use of performance-enhancing drugs from 1997 onwards in June 2008. No clear evidence has emerged, and Pettigrew never admitted anything further before his 2010 suicide, of him using performance-enhancing drugs during the 1991 season.

In the final event of the Tokyo Championships, the men&#x27;s 4 x 400 relay was billed as a two-way contest between the Great Britain team and the United States team. In an unusual change of tactics, the GB team members decided to put Black on the opening leg, followed by Redmond, then John Regis and, on anchor, the 400 m hurdler Kriss Akabusi. Black later explained the tactics were to put him as first runner to give the team a lead or at least keep the team in close contention. Black&#x27;s leg was 44.6 from a standing start. Redmond&#x27;s leg was 44.1, though he conceded the lead to Quincy Watts. Regis followed Everett round the third lap, clocking 44.3. While Everett handed to Pettigrew with a two-metre lead, Regis handed to Akabusi. Akabusi sat in behind the World Champion Pettigrew for the first 200 m of the final lap, closed around the crown of the final bend and then the much improved Akabusi kicked past Pettigrew in the final 80 m to pull off a spectacular victory, winning in a time of 2:57.53 – a British and European record time.

Black set a new British Record of 44.37 seconds on 3 July 1996 in Lausanne, Switzerland. This was subsequently broken a year later by Iwan Thomas who shaved 0.01s from Black&#x27;s time. Fellow GB athlete Mark Richardson also equalled Black&#x27;s mark in 1998. As of July 2022, Black&#x27;s time still stands as the third fastest of all time recorded by a British runner.

His greatest individual achievement in track and field was in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta when in the final of the 400 m he finished in second place behind Michael Johnson, winning the silver medal in the process. However, partly due to injuries, he never rediscovered this form, and subsequently retired from the sport only two years later in 1998 after he was not selected for the 1998 European Championships.

Black was coached by Mike Smith and Mike Whittingham, and was sponsored by Reebok.

==1997 World Championships==
The World Championships&#x27; 4 × 400 m originally saw the USA beat Great Britain by 0.18 seconds in a thrilling finale. Subsequently, US athlete, Antonio Pettigrew admitted to using performance-enhancing substances during this period.

On 7 January 2010, it was announced that Great Britain&#x27;s 1997 World Championship 4 × 400 m relay team are to be awarded the gold medal due to the disqualification of the USA team.

Black, running second leg, tied up and lost ground to his old rival Pettigrew but Jamie Baulch and Mark Richardson held second place round the last two laps. Great Britain&#x27;s time of 2:56.65 was just outside the time they achieved in Atlanta the previous year.

==Awards==
Black was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1992 New Year Honours for services to athletics. In 1995 Southampton University gave Black an honorary degree.

==Television career==

In 1998 Black appeared on the children&#x27;s news programme &quot;Newsround&quot; with fellow athlete Iwan Thomas reporting on childhood obesity.

Black has worked regularly for the BBC on programmes such as &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Grandstand&quot;. In 2004 he was one of the celebrities that took part in the pro-am dancing contest &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; on BBC One. In September 2006, he took part in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; programme, reaching the final along with Matt Dawson and Hardeep Singh Kohli.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1999, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Heathrow Airport.

==Writing==
Black has written an autobiography, published by Andre Deutsch, entitled &quot;How Long&#x27;s the Course?&quot;, 

==Personal life==
Black is married to Julia Burgess, with whom he had twin boys George and Max in 2006. Black also has a daughter, Isabelle from his previous marriage to Elsa Devassoigne. Despite being born in Gosport, and attending the prestigious Portsmouth Grammar School, Black is a supporter of Southampton F.C. In August 2014, Black was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In February 2025, Black revealed he had undergone open heart surgery during the previous month for a condition he was first diagnosed with aged 11 but which had worsened.

<text>Lambert Wickes (1735 – October 1, 1777) was a captain in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War.

==Revolutionary activities==

Wickes was born sometime in 1735 in Kent County, Province of Maryland. His home was on Eastern Neck Island, in the family home, Wickliffe. Prior to the American Revolution, Wickes was captain of the merchant ships the &quot;Neptune&quot; and the &quot;Ceres&quot;. On March 28, 1776 the Continental Congress allowed the purchase of the 18-gun brig which would be renamed the . In May of the same year, Wickes was the Reprisal&#x27;s captain and he was ordered to sail into battle against the British frigate Roebuck which was opening the Delaware River to British ships. Wickes would later be designated as number 11 on the Continental Navy&#x27;s seniority list.

The Committee of Secret Correspondence of Congress, by arrangement with the Marine Committee, issued orders for Capt. Wickes to proceed to the West Indies in &quot;Reprisal&quot; and bring out munitions for use by General Washington&#x27;s army. In addition, Wickes was to transport William Bingham to his post, the French possession of Martinique, as agent for the American colonies.

&quot;Reprisal&quot; passed down the Delaware River from Philadelphia during the latter part of June 1776. While en route, &quot;Reprisal&quot; went to the aid of the harried Continental 6-gun brig &quot;Nancy&quot; — bound from St. Croix and St. Thomas with 386 barrels of gunpowder — which was being chased by six British men-of-war. In order to save &quot;Nancy&quot;, her captain, Hugh Montgomery, ran her aground. &quot;Reprisal&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; – the latter under the command of Capt. John Barry – kept boats from HMS &quot;Kingfisher&quot; at bay and succeeded in landing some 200 barrels of the precious powder. In this engagement, Wickes&#x27; brother, Richard Wickes, was killed while serving as third lieutenant in &quot;Reprisal&quot;.
This engagement became known as the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet.

Clearing the Delaware capes on July 3, &quot;Reprisal&quot;, under Wickes&#x27; sterling seamanship, captured a number of prizes in the West Indies and had a sharp engagement with , beating her off and escaping into port.

On October 24, 1776, Wickes was ordered to France with Benjamin Franklin and his two grandsons as passengers. On November 27, while approaching the coast of France, Captain Wickes received Ambassador Franklin&#x27;s permission to engage two brigs, and captured them both: the brigantines &quot;George&quot; and &quot;La Vigne&quot;. On November 29, still some distance from Nantes, Wickes had to drop anchor because of unfavorable winds. Four days later Wickes hailed a fishing boat, which took Franklin and his grandsons ashore at the village of Auray. Setting sail in January 1777, Wickes took &quot;Reprisal&quot; to sea on a cruise which took her to the Bay of Biscay and the mouth of the English Channel. On February 5, his ship captured the armed packet-boat &quot;Swallow&quot;, carrying mail between Britain and its ally Portugal, after a hard action of 40 minutes duration. During the battle, &quot;Reprisal&quot; suffered two officers seriously wounded and one man killed.

During the remainder of this foray against British shipping, Wickes took five additional prizes and left them at Port Louis. Wickes moved &quot;Reprisal&quot; to Lorient, but was ordered to leave the port in 24 hours by the French government—the port authorities apparently stirred to action by bitter remonstrances from the British government. Wickes, however, claimed that &quot;Reprisal&quot; had sprung a leak and needed to be careened for hull repairs. Wickes proved to be skillful at gaining time; as, on several occasions, he thwarted the intentions of the French government to have him sail.

In April 1777, the Continental vessels &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Dolphin&quot; joined &quot;Reprisal&quot; and constituted a squadron under Wickes&#x27; command. Setting sail from St. Auzeau on May 28, the ships cruised around Ireland in June, July, and August; during one phase of the voyage, the three ships captured 15 ships in five days. On September 14, Wickes left France in &quot;Reprisal&quot;, in company with &quot;Dolphin&quot;, bound for home. The ships encountered a Nor’Easter near the Grand Banks around October 1, and &quot;Reprisal&quot; foundered with the loss of all hands except the cook.

==Legacy==
Louis H. Bolander, the assistant librarian at the Naval Academy, wrote an article on Wickes in 1928, entitled &quot;A Forgotten Hero of the American Revolution.&quot; Appearing in &quot;Americana,&quot; in April 1928, the article closed with a fitting epitaph for Capt. Lambert Wickes: &quot;Thus closed a career distinguished for patriotism, gallantry and humanity, for not a single charge of cruelty or harshness was ever breathed against him by any one of his many prisoners. Franklin, who knew him well, said of him, &#x27;He was a gallant officer, and a very worthy man.&#x27; &quot;

Two ships in the United States Navy have been named in his honor.

The two iron balls on each side of a magnetic compass, used to balance out and counteract magnetic variations based on a ship&#x27;s location, are traditionally called &quot;Lamberts&quot;, in his honor.

<text>Count Adelardo Tommaso Salvadori Paleotti (30 September 1835 – 9 October 1923) was an Italian zoologist and ornithologist.

==Biography==
Salvadori was born in Porto San Giorgio, son of Count Luigi Salvadori and Ethelyn Welby, who was English. His brother Giorgio married their cousin Adele Emiliani (daughter of Giacomo Emiliani and Casson Adelaide Welby) and had five children (Charlie, Robbie, Minnie, Nellie and Guglielmo &quot;Willie&quot;). His nephew Guglielmo Salvadori Paleotti married Giacinta Galletti de Cadilhac (daughter of Arturo Galletti de Cadilhac and Margaret Collier) and had three children (Gladys, Massimo &quot;Max&quot; and Gioconda Beatrice &quot;Joyce&quot;). He studied medicine in Pisa and Rome and graduated in medicine at the University of Pisa. 
He participated in Garibaldi&#x27;s military expedition in Sicily (the Expedition of the Thousand), serving as a medical officer.

He was assistant in the Museum of Zoology in 1863, becoming Vice-Director of the Royal Museum of Natural History in Turin in 1879.

==The naturalist==
Tommaso Salvadori took an early interest in birds and published a catalogue of the birds of Sardinia in 1862.

He was a specialist in birds of Asia. He studied the wide collections of birds of these regions held by the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova and the collections of East Indian birds at Paris, London, Berlin and Leyden.

In 1880, he was on leave to the British Museum of Natural History in London to work on three volumes of their &quot;Catalogue of the Birds&quot;.

Salvadori&#x27;s pheasant (&quot;Lophura inornata&quot;) is named after him, as is also the crocodile monitor (&quot;Varanus salvadorii&quot;), which is also commonly known as Salvadori&#x27;s monitor, the Papua monitor, or the artelia. 

Many other species of birds are named after him, for example, Salvadori&#x27;s fig parrot &quot;Psittaculirostris salvadorii&quot;, Yellow-capped pygmy parrot (&quot;Micropsitta keiensis&quot;), Salvadori nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus pulchellus&quot;), Salvadori&#x27;s antwren (&quot;Myrmotherula minor&quot;), Salvadori&#x27;s eremomela (&quot;Eremomela salvadorii&quot;), Salvadori&#x27;s seedeater (&quot;Serinus xantholaemus&quot;), Salvadori&#x27;s teal (&quot;Salvadorina waigiuensis&quot;) and others.

He published as many as 300 papers in ornithology.

<doc id="805870" wikidata="Q150248" url="?curid=805870" title="Metacritic">
<text>Metacritic is an American website that aggregates reviews of films, television shows, music albums, video games, and formerly books. For each product, the scores from each review are averaged (a weighted average). Metacritic was created by Jason Dietz, Marc Doyle, and Julie Doyle Roberts in 1999, and was acquired by Fandom, Inc. in 2022.

Metacritic turns each review into a percentage score. This can be done either by calculating the score from the rating given or by making a subjective decision based on the review&#x27;s quality. Before averaging the scores, they are adjusted based on the critic&#x27;s popularity, reputation, and the number of reviews they have written. The site also includes a summary from each review and links to the original source, using colors like green, yellow, or red to indicate the overall sentiment of the critics.

Metacritic won two Webby Awards for excellence as an aggregation website. It is regarded as the foremost online review aggregation site for the video game industry. Criticism of the site has focused on the assessment system, the assignment of scores to reviews that do not include ratings, third-party attempts to influence the scores, and the reported lack of staff oversight for user reviews.

== History ==

Metacritic was launched in January 2001 by Marc Doyle, his sister Julie Doyle Roberts, and his University of Southern California law classmate Jason Dietz, after two years of developing the site. Rotten Tomatoes was already compiling movie reviews, but Doyle, Roberts, and Dietz saw an opportunity to cover a broader range of media.

Metacritic was sold to &quot;CNET&quot; in 2005. CNET and Metacritic were later acquired by the CBS Corporation. In 2020, Metacritic and other &quot;CNET&quot; titles were bought by Red Ventures. In 2022, Red Ventures sold Metacritic and other entertainment websites to Fandom, Inc.

=== Influence ===
Metacritic has been used by businesses to predict future sales. In 2007, Nick Wingfield of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that Metacritic &quot;influence[s] the sales of games and the stocks of video game publishers&quot;. He explains its influence as coming from the higher cost of buying video games than music or movie tickets. Many executives say that low scores &quot;can hurt the long-term sales potential&quot;. Wingfield wrote that Wall Street pays attention to Metacritic and GameRankings because the sites typically post scores before sales data are publicly available, citing the respective rapid rise and fall in company values after &quot;BioShock&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; were released. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Marc Doyle cited two major publishers that &quot;conducted comprehensive statistical surveys through which they&#x27;ve been able to draw a correlation between high metascores and stronger sales&quot; in certain genres. He claimed that an increasing number of businesses and financial analysts use Metacritic as &quot;an early indicator of a game&#x27;s potential sales and, by extension, the publisher&#x27;s stock price&quot;. However, a 2015 study analyzing over 88 Xbox 360 and 80 PS3 games from 2012 found that Metacritic scores did not impact actual sales.

Controversially, the website has been used by game publishers as a means of determining whether a game&#x27;s developer receives additional royalties. One notable example is the 2010 game &quot;,&quot; which received an average Metascore of 84, one short of the 85 points required by Bethesda Softworks, the game&#x27;s publisher. As a result, its developer, Obsidian Entertainment, received no additional bonus. Columnists took issue with the company&#x27;s use of Metacritic, with one suggesting that this makes game critics ultimately accountable for deciding the developer&#x27;s profits and another pointing out that a Metascore of 84 is not significantly lower than 85. The latter also pointed out the impressive sales of five million sold units and US$300 million in revenue, and also noted a series of Obsidian&#x27;s layoffs in 2011 and 2012.

The website has also been used by columnists and commentators as a general reference for critical reception, and by publishers as a tool of improving their products. Along with other executives, in 2008, John Riccitiello, then CEO of Electronic Arts, showed Wall Street analysts a chart illustrating a downward trend in the average critical ratings of the company&#x27;s games. He took the ratings seriously and stressed the need for the company to bounce back. Also in 2008, Microsoft used Metacritic averages to delist underperforming Xbox Live Arcade games.

== Metascores ==
Scores are weighted averages. Certain publications are given more significance &quot;because of their stature&quot;. Metacritic has said that it will not reveal the relative weight assigned to each reviewer.

Games Editor Marc Doyle was interviewed in 2008 by Keith Stuart of &quot;The Guardian&quot; to &quot;get a look behind the metascoring process&quot;. Stuart wrote: &quot;The Metascore phenomenon, namely Metacritic and GameRankings, have become an enormously important element of online games journalism over the past few years&quot;. Doyle said that because video games lead to a greater investment of time and money, gamers are more informed about reviews than are fans of film or music; they want to know &quot;whether that hotly anticipated title is going to deliver&quot;.

In June 2018, Metacritic established the &quot;Must-See&quot; label for a movie that &quot;achieves a Metascore of 81 or higher and has been reviewed by a minimum of 15 professional critics&quot;. In September 2018, it added the &quot;Must-Play&quot; certification for video games attaining a score of 90% or more, and a minimum number of 15 reviews from industry professionals.

The standalone highest-rated game of all time on the site is &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, with a 99. The three games with a 98 are &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, and &quot;Soulcalibur.&quot; There are about two dozen 97-rated games with standouts including &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto V.&quot; There are fourteen movies that have received a 100: &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;; &quot;The Godfather&quot;; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;; &quot;Rear Window&quot;; &quot;Casablanca&quot;; &quot;Boyhood&quot;; &quot;Three Colors: Red&quot;; &quot;Vertigo&quot;; &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;; &quot;Notorious&quot;; &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;; &quot;Dekalog&quot;; &quot;The Leopard&quot;; and &quot;The Conformist&quot;. There are five TV show seasons that have received a 99, including Season 4 of &quot;Rectify&quot;, Season 4 and Season 6 of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, Season 1 of &quot;Murder One&quot;, and Season 5 of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. The standalone highest-rated album of all time on the site is &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; by English rock band Led Zeppelin, with a 100.

The standalone lowest-rated game of all time is &quot;Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&quot;, with an 8. There are eleven movies that have received a 1: &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, &quot;10 Rules for Sleeping Around&quot;, &quot;Chaos&quot;, &quot;Inappropriate Comedy&quot;, &quot;Not Cool&quot;, &quot;The Singing Forest&quot;, &quot;The Garbage Pail Kids Movie&quot;, &quot;Death of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Hardbodies&quot;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;United Passions&quot;. The standalone lowest-rated TV show of all time is &quot;The 1/2 Hour News Hour&quot;, with a 13. The standalone lowest-rated album of all time is &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; by Kevin Federline, with a 15.

== Reception ==
Metacritic has received mixed reviews from website critics, commentators, and columnists. Its efficacy has been analyzed, with conclusions finding it to be generally useful or unreliable and biased. The website won two annual Webby Awards for excellence in the &quot;Guides/Ratings/Reviews&quot; category, in 2010 and 2015.

=== Criticism ===
Metacritic has been criticized for converting all scoring systems into a single quantitative percentage-based scale. For example, an &quot;A&quot; score equates to the value of 100, an &quot;F&quot; the value of zero, and a &quot;B−&quot; the value of 67. Joe Dodson, former editor at &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, criticized Metacritic and similar sites for turning reviews into scores that he found to be too low. Doyle defended the grading system, believing that every scale should be converted directly to that of the website, with its lowest possible score being 0 and the highest 100. Further criticism was directed to the website&#x27;s refusal to publicize how it aggregates scores.

According to Doyle, publishers often try to persuade him to exclude reviews they feel are unfair, but he said that once a publication is included, he refuses to omit any of its reviews. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; review of &quot;Uncharted 4&quot; was assigned with a rating of 40/100 by Metacritic; this was the only negative review of the game. Readers who disapproved of the review petitioned Metacritic to remove the &quot;Post&quot; as a trusted source. As a result of its perceived negative influence on the industry, several reviewing sites, including &quot;Kotaku&quot; and &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, have dropped numerical reviews that would appear in Metacritic, instead favoring a qualitative assessment of a game. &quot;Kotaku&quot; also highlighted a practice alleged to be used by some publishers who use Metacritic scores as a way to leverage more favorable terms for the publisher or deny developers bonuses should they not reach a certain score. Doyle countered this by saying &quot;Metacritic has absolutely nothing to do with how the industry uses our numbers... Metacritic has always been about educating the gamer. We&#x27;re using product reviews as a tool to help them make the most of their time and money.&quot;

Metacritic has also been criticized for how it handles banning users and their reviews, with no notice or formal process for appeal. Critics and developers have pointed out that a product can suffer from rating manipulation by users, as by garnering low ratings that purposely damage its reputation or by receiving high ratings from throwaway accounts to make it appear more popular than it actually is. Signal Studios president and creative director Douglas Albright described the website as having no standards. In July 2020, Metacritic added a 36-hour waiting period for user reviews to be posted for video games at launch in an effort to reduce user score review-bombing during that period by users that have not or insufficiently played the game during a period when most players will not have finished the game.

Some have noted that Metacritic scores for modern video games may not be accurately reflective of a game&#x27;s state in the future due to post-release updates and patches as well as most press reviews of games taking place around their launch. For example, the metascore for &quot;MediEvil&quot; (2019) was mixed mainly due to performance issues that existed around the time of the game&#x27;s launch. These issues were fixed in post-release patches that made the game run smoothly, which would have led to a higher metascore in its patched state. Another example is online games such as &quot;Final Fantasy XIV Online&quot; and &quot;Warframe&quot;, which received mixed scores initially but became more well-received following improvements made after launch.
