<text>The recorded military history of China extends from about 2200 BC to the present day. Chinese pioneered the use of crossbows, advanced metallurgical standardization for arms and armor, early gunpowder weapons, and other advanced weapons, but also adopted nomadic cavalry and Western military technology. China&#x27;s armies also benefited from an advanced logistics system as well as a rich strategic tradition, beginning with Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;, that deeply influenced military thought.

==History of military organization==

The military history of China stretches from roughly 1900 BC to the present day. Chinese armies were advanced and powerful, especially after the Warring States period. These armies were tasked with the twofold goal of defending China and her subject peoples from foreign intruders, and with expanding China&#x27;s territory and influence across Asia.

===Pre-Warring States Period===
Early Chinese armies were relatively small affairs. Composed of peasant levies, usually serfs dependent upon the king or the feudal lord of their home state, these armies were relatively ill-equipped. While organized military forces existed along with the state, few records remain of these early armies. These armies were centered around the chariot-riding nobility, who played a role akin to the European knight as they were the main fighting force of the army. Bronze weapons such as spears and swords were the main equipment of both the infantry and charioteers. These armies were ill-trained and haphazardly supplied, meaning that they could not campaign for more than a few months and often had to give up their gains due to lack of supplies. The &quot;shi&quot; knights had a strict code of chivalry. During the Shang and Western Zhou eras, warfare was seen as an aristocratic affair, complete with protocols that may be compared to the chivalry of the European knight.

Under the Shang and Zhou, these armies were able to expand China&#x27;s territory and influence from a narrow part of the Yellow River valley to all of the North China plain. Equipped with bronze weapons, bows, and armor, these armies won victories against the sedentary Dongyi to the East and South, which were the main direction of expansion, as well as defending the western border against the nomadic incursions of the Xirong. However, after the collapse of the Zhou dynasty in 771 BC when the Xirong captured its capital Haojing, China collapsed into a plethora of small states, who warred frequently with each other. The competition between these states would eventually produce the professional armies that marked the Imperial Era of China.

====Prehistory and Shang dynasty====
Early Bronze Age Chinese cities were characterized by massive defensive walls. The Erlitou culture&#x27;s bronze workshops probably gave it a decisive edge over competing groups. Armies were probably relatively ineffective given the prevalence of extensive fortifications, although the Erlitou culture probably succeeded in breaching these occasionally since they were able to expand the area of their control. Starting from the 3rd Millennium BC and throughout the 2nd Millennium BC, there is a correlation between elite status and military status in tomb artefacts.

====Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn period====
While chariots had been used in battle previously, only in the Western Zhou era were they used in large numbers. The Zhou conquest of the Shang may have been linked to their use of the chariot. Under the Shang, chariots were extremely ornate, used by high ranking elite as command and archery platforms, but under the Zhou chariots were simpler and more common. The ratio of chariots to foot soldiers under the Shang is estimated to be 1 to 30, while under the Zhou it is estimated to be 1 to 10. However this was still limited as compared to the 1 to 5 in Ancient Egypt.

In the Spring and Autumn period, archery switched from targeted shooting to massed volleys. By the end of the Spring and Autumn period, cavalry had appeared on the battlefield, and the chariot would gradually revert to being a command platform in the course of the ensuing Warring States period.

===Warring States===


By the time of the Warring States, reforms began that abolished feudalism and created powerful, centralized states. The power of the aristocracy was curbed and for the first time, professional generals were appointed on merit, rather than birth. Technological advances such as iron weapons and crossbows put the chariot-riding nobility out of business and favored large, professional standing armies, who were well-supplied and could fight a sustained campaign. The size of armies increased; whereas before 500 BC Chinese field armies numbered in the tens of thousands, by 300 BC armies regularly included up to a couple of hundred thousand drafted soldiers, accompanied by cavalry. For example, during the Battle of Changping the state of Qin drafted all males over 15 years of age. Although these conscripts with one to two years of training would be no match individually against aristocratic warriors with years of experience, they made up for it with superior standardization, discipline, organization, and size. Although most soldiers were conscripts, it was also common to select soldiers based on specific qualifications. The Confucian adviser Xun Zi claimed that foot soldiers from the Wei state were required to wear armor and helmets, shoulder a crossbow with fifty arrows, strap a spear and sword, carry three days&#x27; supply of rations, and all the while march 100 li (41.6 km, based on the Eastern Zhou li) in a day. When a man meets this requirement, his household would be exempted from all corvée labor obligations. He would also be given special tax benefits on land and housing. However, this policy made soldiers in the Wei state difficult to replace.

In addition, cavalry was introduced. The first recorded use of cavalry took place in the Battle of Maling, in which general Pang Juan of Wei led his division of 5,000 cavalry into a trap by Qi forces. In 307 BC, King Wuling of Zhao ordered the adoption of nomadic clothing in order to train his own division of cavalry archers.

In the field of military planning, the niceties of chivalrous warfare were abandoned in favor of a general who would ideally be a master of maneuver, illusion, and deception. He had to be ruthless in searching for the advantage, and an organizer in integrating units under him.

===Qin–Han===


In 221 BC, the Qin unified China and ushered in the Imperial Era of Chinese history. Although it only lasted 15 years, Qin established institutions that would last for millennia. Qin Shi Huan, titling himself as the &quot;First Emperor&quot;, standardized writing systems, weights, coinage, and even the axle lengths of carts. To reduce the chance of rebellion, he made the private possession of weapons illegal. In order to increase the rapid deployment of troops, thousands of miles of roads were built, along with canals that allowed boats to travel long distances. For the rest of Chinese history, a centralized empire was the norm.

During the Qin dynasty and its successor, the Han, the Chinese armies were faced with a new military threat, that of nomadic confederations such as the Xiongnu in the North. These nomads were fast horse archers who had a significant mobility advantage over the settled nations to the South. In order to counter this threat, the Chinese built the Great Wall as a barrier to these nomadic incursions, and also used diplomacy and bribes to preserve peace. Although the Qin general Meng Tian ousted the Xiong-nu from the Ordos region, they regained power under the rule of Maodun. Maodun conquered the Eastern Hu and drove the Yuezhi tribes west. He reclaimed the Ordos from the now crumbling Qin empire and defeated the first Han emperor Gao in battle. This led to a policy of appeasement until the reign of Wudi of Han, who decided to take a tougher stance. However, protecting the borders required a significant investment. Manning the stations of the Great Wall took about ten thousand men. To support them, fifty to sixty thousand soldier-farmers were moved to the frontiers in order to reduce the cost of transporting supplies. These drafted farmers were not good cavalry troops, so a professional army emerged on the frontiers. These consisted of northern Han mercenaries, convicts working for their freedom, and subjected &quot;Southern&quot; Xiong-nu living within Han territory. By 31 BC, the Han dynasty abolished universal military conscription that was passed down from the Warring States. In the South, China&#x27;s territory was roughly doubled as the Chinese conquered much of what is now Southern China, and extended the frontier from the Yangtze to Vietnam.

Armies during the Qin and Han dynasties largely inherited their institutions from the earlier Warring States period, with the major exception that cavalry forces were becoming more and more important, due to the threat of the Xiongnu. Under Emperor Wu of Han, the Chinese launched a series of massive cavalry expeditions against the Xiongnu, defeating them and conquering much of what is now Northern China, Western China, Mongolia, Central Asia, and Korea. After these victories, Chinese armies were tasked with the goal of holding the new territories against incursions and revolts by peoples such as the Qiang, Xianbei and Xiongnu who had come under Chinese rule.

The structure of the army also changed in this period. While the Qin had utilized a conscript army, by Eastern Han, the army was made up largely of volunteers and conscription could be avoided by paying a fee. Those who presented the government with supplies, horses, or slaves were also exempted from conscription.

===Three Kingdoms–Jin===

The end of the Han dynasty saw a massive agrarian uprising that had to be quelled by local governors, who seized the opportunity to form their own armies. The central army disintegrated and was replaced by a series of local warlords, who fought for power until most of the North was unified by Cao Cao, who laid the foundation for the Wei dynasty, which ruled most of China. However, much of Southern China was ruled by two rival Kingdoms, Shu Han and Wu. As a result, this era is known as the Three Kingdoms.

Under the Wei dynasty, the military system changed from the centralized military system of the Han. Unlike the Han, whose forces were concentrated into a central army of volunteer soldiers, Wei&#x27;s forces depended on the Buqu, a group for whom soldiering was a hereditary profession. These &quot;military households&quot; were given land to farm, but their children could only marry into the families of other &quot;military households&quot;. In effect, the military career was inherited; when a soldier or commander died or became unable to fight, a male relative would inherit his position. These hereditary soldiers provided the bulk of the infantry. For the purpose of cavalry, the Wei was similar to the previous Han dynasty in recruiting large numbers of Xiongnu that were settled in southern Shanxi. In addition, provincial armies, which were very weak under the Han, became the bulk of the army under the Wei, for whom the central army was held mainly as a reserve. This military system was also adopted by the Jin dynasty, who succeeded the Wei and unified China.

Advances such as the stirrup helped make cavalry forces more effective.

===Era of division===

In 304 AD, a major event shook China. The Jin dynasty, who had unified China 24 years earlier, was tottering in collapse due to a major civil war. Seizing this opportunity, Xiong-nu chieftain Liu Yuan and his forces revolted against their Han Chinese overlords. He was followed by many other barbarian leaders, and these rebels were called the &quot;Wu Hu&quot; or literally &quot;Five barbarian tribes&quot;. By 316 AD, the Jin had lost all territory north of the Huai river. From this point on, much of North China was ruled by Sinicized barbarian tribes such as the Xianbei, while southern China remained under Han Chinese rule, a period known as the Era of Division. During this era, the military forces of both Northern and southern regimes diverged and developed very differently.

====Northern====

Northern China was devastated by the Wu Hu uprisings. After the initial uprising, the various tribes fought among themselves in a chaotic era known as the Sixteen Kingdoms. Although brief unifications of the North, such as Later Zhao and Former Qin, occurred, these were relatively short-lived. During this era, the Northern armies, were mainly based around nomadic cavalry, but also employed Chinese as foot soldiers and siege personnel. This military system was rather improvising and ineffective, and the states established by the Wu Hu were mostly destroyed by the Jin dynasty or the Xianbei.
A new military system did not come until the invasions of the Xianbei in the 5th century, by which time most of the Wu Hu had been destroyed and much of North China had been reconquered by the Chinese dynasties in the South. Nevertheless, the Xianbei won many successes against the Chinese, conquering all of North China by 468 AD The Xianbei state of Northern Wei created the earliest forms of the equal field (均田) land system and the Fubing system (府兵) military system, both of which became major institutions under Sui and Tang. Under the fubing system each headquarters (府) commanded about one thousand farmer-soldiers who could be mobilized for war. In peacetime they were self-sustaining on their land allotments, and were obliged to do tours of active duty in the capital.

====Southern====

Southern Chinese dynasties, being descended from the Han and Jin, prided themselves on being the successors of the Chinese civilization and disdained the Northern dynasties, who they viewed as barbarian usurpers. Southern armies continued the military system of Buqu or hereditary soldiers from the Jin dynasty. However, the growing power of aristocratic landowners, who also provided many of the buqu, meant that the Southern dynasties were very unstable; after the fall of the Jin, four dynasties ruled in just two centuries.

This is not to say that the Southern armies did not work well. Southern armies won great victories in the late 4th century, such as the battle of Fei at which an 80,000-man Jin army crushed the 300,000-man army of Former Qin, an empire founded by one of the Wu Hu tribes that had briefly unified North China. In addition, under the brilliant general Liu Yu, Chinese armies briefly reconquered much of North China.

===Sui–Tang===
In 581 AD, the Chinese Yang Jian forced the Xianbei ruler to abdicate, founding the Sui dynasty and restoring Chinese rule in the North. By 589 AD, he had unified much of China.

The Sui&#x27;s unification of China sparked a new golden age. During the Sui and Tang, Chinese armies, based on the Fubing system invented during the era of division, won military successes that restored the empire of the Han dynasty and reasserted Chinese power. The Tang created large contingents of powerful heavy cavalry. A key component of the success of Sui and Tang armies, just like the earlier Qin and Han armies, was the adoption of large elements of cavalry. These powerful horsemen, combined with the superior firepower of the Chinese infantry (powerful missile weapons such as recurve crossbows), made Chinese armies powerful.

However, during the Tang dynasty the &quot;fubing&quot; (府兵) system began to break down. Based on state ownership of the land under the &quot;juntian&quot; system, the prosperity of the Tang dynasty meant that the state&#x27;s lands were being bought up in ever increasing quantities. Consequently, the state could no longer provide land to the farmers, and the &quot;juntian&quot; system broke down. By the 8th century, the Tang had reverted to the centralized military system of the Han. However, this also did not last, and it broke down during the disorder of the An Lushan, which saw many &quot;fanzhen&quot; or local generals become extraordinarily powerful. These &quot;fanzhen&quot; were so powerful they collected taxes, raised armies, and made their positions hereditary. Because of this, the central army of the Tang was greatly weakened. Eventually, the Tang dynasty collapsed and the various &quot;fanzhen&quot; were made into separate kingdoms, a situation that would last until the Song dynasty.

During the Tang, professional military writing and schools began to be set up to train officers, an institution that would be expanded during the Song.

Tibetan tradition says that the Tang dynasty seized the Tibetan capital at Lhasa in 650. In 763 the Tibetans captured the Tang capital at Chang&#x27;an, for fifteen days during the An Shi Rebellion.

In 756, over 4,000 Arab mercenaries joined the Chinese against An Lushan. They remained in China, and some of them were ancestors of the Hui people. During the Tang dynasty, 3,000 Chinese soldiers, and 3,000 Muslim soldiers were traded to each other in an agreement.

===Liao, Song and Jurchen Jin===

During the Song dynasty, the emperors were focused on curbing the power of the Fanzhen, local generals who they viewed as responsible for the collapse of the Tang dynasty. Local power was curbed and most power was centralized in the government, along with the army. In addition, the Song adopted a system in which commands by generals were ad hoc and temporary; this was to prevent the troops from becoming attached to their generals, who could potentially rebel. Successful generals such as Yue Fei and Liu Zen were persecuted by the Song Court who feared they would rebel.

Although the system worked when it came to quelling rebellions, it was a failure in defending China and asserting its power. The Song had to rely on new gunpowder weapons introduced during the late Tang and bribes to fend off attacks by its enemies, such as the Liao (Khitans), West Xia (Tanguts), Jin (Jurchens), and Mongol Empire, as well as an expanded army of over 1 million men. The Song was greatly disadvantaged by the fact their neighbors had taken advantage of the era of chaos following the collapse of the Tang to advance into Northern China unimpeded. The Song also lost the horse-producing regions which made their cavalry extremely inferior.

The military technology of the Song included gunpowder weapons such as fire lances, cast-iron gunpowder bombs, and rockets were employed in large numbers. The Song government also created China&#x27;s first standing navy. This military technology and prosperous economy were key for the Song army to fend off invaders who could not be bribed with &quot;tribute payments,&quot; such as the Khitans and Jur&#x27;chens. Song forces held off Central Asian Mongol armies longer than did other settled peoples, until the fall of the Song in 1279.

===Yuan===

Founded by the Mongols who conquered Song China, the Yuan had the same military system as most nomadic peoples to China&#x27;s north, focused mainly on nomadic cavalry, who were organized based on households and who were led by leaders appointed by the khan.

The Mongol invasion started in earnest only when they acquired their first navy, mainly from Chinese Song defectors. Liu Cheng, a Chinese Song commander who defected to the Mongols, suggested a switch in tactics, and assisted the Mongols in building their own fleet. Many Chinese served in the Mongol navy and army and assisted them in their conquest of Song.

However, in the conquest of China, the Mongols also adopted gunpowder weapons such as the thundercrash bomb and thousands of Chinese infantry and naval forces into the Mongol army. Another weapon adopted by the Mongols were Saracen counterweight trebuchets designed by Muslim engineers; these proved decisive in the Siege of Xiangyang, whose capture by the Mongols precipitated the beginning of the end for the Song dynasty. The Mongol military system began to collapse after the 14th century and by 1368 the Mongols was driven out by the Chinese Ming dynasty.

The Mongols under Genghis Khan and Hulagu also brought Chinese artillery specialists within their armies who specialized in mangonels, to Persia.

During the Mongol invasion of Iraq, 1,000 Chinese crossbowmen who utilized fire arrows participated in the invasion, along with the Mongol tribesmen. In 1258 the commander of the Mongol Hulagu Khan&#x27;s forces besieging Baghdad was a Chinese General Guo Kan. The Chinese General Guo Kan was then made Governor of Baghdad by Hulagu, who also brought Chinese technicians specializing in hydraulics to engineer the Tigris–Euphrates basin irrigation systems. This resulted in the Middle East being permeated by major Chinese influence during Hulagu&#x27;s reign.

Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin. Two Han Chinese leaders, Shi Tianze, (, Liu Ni), and the Khitan () defected and commanded the 3 Tumens in the Mongol army. Liu Heima and Shi Tianze served Ogödei Khan. Liu Heima and Shi Tianxiang led armies against Western Xia for the Mongols. There were 4 Han Tumens and 3 Khitan Tumens, with each Tumen consisting of 10,000 troops. The three Khitan Generals Shimobeidier (), Tabuyir () and Xiaozhacizhizizhongxi () commanded the three Khitan Tumens and the four Han Generals Zhang Rou, Yan Shi, Shi Tianze, and Liu Heima commanded the four Han tumens under Ogödei Khan. The Mongols received defections from Han Chinese and Khitans while the Jin were abandoned by their own Jurchen officers.

Shi Tianze was a Han Chinese who lived in the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). Interethnic marriage between Han and Jurchen became common at this time. His father was Shi Bingzhi (史秉直, Shih Ping-chih). Shi Bingzhi was married to a Jurchen woman (surname Na-ho) and a Han Chinese woman (surname Chang), it is unknown which of them was Shi Tianze&#x27;s mother. Shi Tianze was married to two Jurchen women, a Han Chinese woman, and a Korean woman, and his son Shi Gang was born to one of his Jurchen wives. His Jurchen wives&#x27; surnames were Mo-nien and Na-ho, his Korean wife&#x27;s surname was Li, and his Han Chinese wife&#x27;s surname was Shi. Shi Tianze defected to the Mongol Empire&#x27;s forces upon their invasion of the Jin dynasty. His son Shi Gang married a Kerait woman, the Kerait were Mongolified Turkic people and considered as part of the &quot;Mongol nation&quot;. Shi Tianze (Shih T&#x27;ien-tse), (Chang Jou, ), and (Yen Shih, ) and other high ranking Chinese who served in the Jin dynasty and defected to the Mongols helped build the structure for the administration of the new state. Chagaan (Tsagaan) and Zhang Rou jointly launched an attack on the Song dynasty ordered by Töregene Khatun.

=== Ming ===

The early Ming Emperors from Hongwu to Zhengde continued Yuan practices such as hereditary military institutions, demanding Korean concubines and eunuchs, having Muslim eunuchs, wearing Mongol style clothing and Mongol hats, engaging in archery and horseback riding, having Mongols serve in the Ming military, patronizing Tibetan Buddhism, with the early Ming Emperors seeking to project themselves as &quot;universal rulers&quot; to various peoples such as Central Asian Muslims, Tibetans, and Mongols, modeled after the Mongol Khagan, however, this history of Ming universalism has been obscured and denied by historians who covered it up and presented the Ming as xenophobes seeking to expunge Mongol influence and presenting while they presented the Qing and Yuan as &quot;universal&quot; rulers in contrast to the Ming.

A cavalry-based army modeled on the Yuan military was implemented by the Hongwu and Yongle Emperors. Hongwu&#x27;s army and officialdom incorporated Mongols. Mongols were retained by the Ming within its territory. in Guangxi Mongol archers participated in a war against Miao minorities.

Math, calligraphy, literature, equestrianism, archery, music, and rites were the Six Arts.

At the Guozijian, law, math, calligraphy, equestrianism, and archery were emphasized by the Ming Hongwu Emperor in addition to Confucian classics and also required in the imperial examinations. Archery and equestrianism were added to the exam by Hongwu in 1370 like how archery and equestrianism were required for non-military officials at the 武舉 College of War in 1162 by the Song Emperor Xiaozong. The area around the Meridian Gate of Nanjing was used for archery by guards and generals under Hongwu.

The Imperial exam included archery. Archery on horseback was practiced by Chinese living near the frontier. Wang Ju&#x27;s writings on archery were followed during the Ming and Yuan and the Ming developed new methods of archery. Jinling Tuyong showed archery in Nanjing during the Ming. Contests in archery were held in the capital for Garrison of Guard soldiers who were handpicked.

The Ming focused on building up a powerful standing army that could drive off attacks by foreign barbarians. Beginning in the 14th century, the Ming armies drove out the Mongols and expanded China&#x27;s territories to include Yunnan, Mongolia, Tibet, much of Xinjiang and Vietnam. The Ming also engaged in Overseas expeditions which included one violent conflict in Sri Lanka. Ming armies incorporated gunpowder weapons into their military force, speeding up a development that had been prevalent since the Song.

Ming military institutions were largely responsible for the success of Ming&#x27;s armies. The early Ming&#x27;s military was organized by the Wei-suo system, which split the army up into numerous &quot;Wei&quot; or commands throughout the Ming frontiers. Each wei was to be self-sufficient in agriculture, with the troops stationed there farming as well as training. This system also forced soldiers to serve hereditarily in the army; although effective in initially taking control of the empire, this military system proved unviable in the long run and collapsed in the 1430s, with Ming reverted to a professional volunteer army similar to Tang, Song and Later Han.

Throughout most of the Ming&#x27;s history, the Ming armies were successful in defeating foreign powers such as the Mongols and Japanese and expanding China&#x27;s influence. However, with the little Ice Age in the 17th century, the Ming dynasty was faced with a disastrous famine and its military forces disintegrated as a result of the famines spurring from this event.

The Chinese defeated the Portuguese at the First Battle of Tamao (1521) and at the Second Battle of Tamao (1522) Chinese ships knocked out two Portuguese ships, who were armed with gunpowder weapons, and forced the Portuguese to retreat.

The Ming dynasty defeated the Dutch in the Sino–Dutch conflicts in 1622–1624 over the Penghu islands and at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633. In 1662, Chinese and European arms clashed when a Ming-loyalist army of 25,000 led by Koxinga forced Dutch East India Company garrison of 2,000 on Taiwan into surrender, after a final assault during a seven-month siege. According to Frederick Coyett&#x27;s account written after the siege to absolve himself of the Dutch defeat, the alleged final blow to the company&#x27;s defense came when a Dutch defector, who would warn Koxinga of a life-threatening bombardment, had pointed the inactive besieging army to the weak points of the Dutch star-shaped fort. This claim of a Dutch defector only appears in Coyett&#x27;s account and Chinese records make no such mention of any defector. While the mainstay of the Chinese forces were archers, the Chinese used cannons too during the siege, which however the European eyewitnesses did not judge as effective as the Dutch batteries. The Dutch lost five ships and 130 men in an attempt to relieve the siege of the fortress.

===Qing===
The Qing dynasty, founded by the Manchus, was, like the Yuan a conquest dynasty. The Manchus were a sedentary agricultural people who lived in fixed villages, farmed crops, practiced hunting and mounted archery., In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, founder of the Later Jin dynasty (1616–1636) and originally a Ming vassal, began organizing &quot;Banners&quot;, military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, Korean and Mongol elements under direct command of the Emperor.

The main Manchu tactics were using infantry with bows and arrows, swords, and pikes while cavalry was kept in the rear. Unlike the Song and Ming, however, the Qing armies neglected firearms, and did not develop them in any significant way. The Qing armies also contained a much higher proportion of cavalry than earlier Chinese dynasties.

Hong Taiji, the son of Nurhaci, recognized that Han Chinese were needed in the conquest of the Ming, as he explained why he treated the Ming defector General Hong Chengchou leniently. Ming artillery was responsible for many victories. The Ming would not be easily defeated unless musket and cannon wielding Han Chinese troops were added to the existing banners. Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were often given non-royal Manchu women as wives. Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang after he surrendered the city of Fushun in Liaoning in 1618 and a mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and Hongtaiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.

The Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Chinese who defected up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners were made bannermen, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners so much that ethnic Manchus became a minority, constituting only 16% in 1648, Han Bannermen 75%, and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest.

In 1644, the invading army was multi-ethnic, with Han, Mongols, and Manchu banners. The political divide was between Han Chinese non bannermen and the &quot;conquest elite&quot;, made up of Han Chinese bannermen, nobles, Mongols and Manchu; ethnicity was not the factor. Among the Banners, gunpowder weapons like muskets and artillery were specifically wielded by the Chinese Banners. Bannermen made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule. Han Bannermen dominated the post of governor-general in the time of the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors, and also the post of governors, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians from the posts.

The Qing relied on the Green Standard soldiers, made up of Han Chinese who had defected, to help rule northern China. Green Standard Han Chinese troops governed locally while Han Chinese Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, and Manchu Bannermen were brought only into emergency situations where there was sustained military resistance.

Since it was not possible for only Manchus to conquer southern China, Ming Han Chinese armies conquered the territory for them. Three Liaodong Han Bannermen officers who played a great role in the conquest of southern China were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde, who then governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing. Wu, Geng, and Shang&#x27;s son, Shang Zhixin, in the early 1660s began to feel threatened by the increasing control from the north, and decided they had no choice but to revolt. The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years. At the peak of the rebels&#x27; fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and the Kangxi Emperor was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China from which it took several decades to recover.

Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by the Kangxi Emperor, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels. The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen.

In 1652–1689, during the Sino-Russian border conflicts, the Qing dynasty engaged and pushed back about 2,000 Russian Cossacks in a series of intermittent skirmishes. The frontier in the south-west was extended slowly, in 1701 the Qing defeated Tibetans at the Battle of Dartsedo. The Dzungar Khanate conquered the Uyghurs in the Dzungar conquest of Altishahr and seized control of Tibet. Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Manchu bannermen were commanded by the Han Chinese General Yue Zhongqi in the Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720) which expelled the Dzungars from Tibet and placed it under Qing rule. At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war.

During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor in the mid-late 18th century, they launched the Ten Great Campaigns resulting in victories over the Dzungar Khanate and the Kingdom of Nepal; the Manchus drove the Gurkhas out of Tibet and only stopped their chase near Kathmandu. After the demise of the Dzunghar Khanate, the Manchu authority in Tibet faced only weak opposition. In 1841, the Sino-Sikh war ended with the expulsion of the Sikh army.

A British officer said of Qing forces during the First Opium War, &quot;The Chinese are robust muscular fellows, and no cowards; the Tartars desperate; but neither are well commanded nor acquainted with European warfare. Having had, however, experience of three of them, I am inclined to supposed that a Tartar bullet is not a whit softer than a French one.&quot; Manchus are called &quot;Tartars&quot; in the text.

Southern Chinese coolies served with the French and British forces against the Qing: &quot;The Chinese coolies entertained in 1857 from the inhabitants of South China, renegades though they were, served the British faithfully and cheerfully before Canton, and throughout the operations in North China in 1860 they likewise proved invaluable. Their coolness under fire was admirable. At the assault of the Peiho Forts in 1860 they carried the French ladders to the ditch, and, standing in the water up to their necks, supported them with their hands to enable the storming party to cross. It was not usual to take them into action; they, however, bore the dangers of a distant fire with the greatest composure, evincing a strong desire to close with their compatriots, and engage them in mortal combat with their bamboos.—(Fisher.)&quot;
During the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864), the rebel forces led by able generals such as Shi Dakai were well organized and tactically innovative. After the rebel armies defeated Manchu generals in a series of battles, the Qing government allowed armies made up of foreigners, such as the Ever Victorious Army, and eventually responded by forming armies mainly composed of Han Chinese, and under Han Chinese commanders such as Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, Li Hongzhang and Yuan Shikai. Examples of these armies were the Xiang Army and the Huai Army. The Qing also absorbed bandit armies and Generals who defected to the Qing side during rebellions, such as the Muslim Generals Ma Zhan&#x27;ao, Ma Qianling, Ma Haiyan, and Ma Julung. There were also armies composed of Chinese Muslims led by Muslim Generals like Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, Ma Fuxiang, and Ma Fuxing who commanded the Kansu Braves. Local officials could also take command of military affairs, such as the father of Yang Zengxin during the Panthay Rebellion.

The &quot;First Chinese Regiment&quot; (Weihaiwei Regiment) which was praised for its performance, consisted of Chinese collaborators serving in the British military.

==Modernization==
The Beiyang Army was the army of northern China.

In 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (天津武備學堂) for Chinese army officers, with German advisers, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematics and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects, sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The &#x27;maritime defense fund&#x27; supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy.

The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui (段祺瑞). Among its staff was Yinchang.

The Qing founded Baoding Military Academy.


The earliest modernised units of the Qing military were part of the New Army.

China began to extensively modernize its military in the late 19th century. It purchased the most modern Krupp artillery and Mauser repeater magazine rifles from Germany, in addition to mines and torpedoes. It used these with sniper, pincer, and ambush tactics, and China also began to reorganize its military, adding engineer companies and artillery brigades. Mining, engineering, flooding, and simultaneous multiple attacks were employed by Chinese troops along with modern artillery.
By 1882, the Qing navy had some fifty steam warships, half of them built in China. The American Commodore Robert Shufeldt, reported that the British-built Chinese ships he inspected had &quot;every modern appliance,&quot; including &quot;guns with large calibre and high velocity, moved by hydraulic power, machine guns, electric lights, torpedoes and torpedo boats, engines with twin screws, steel rams, etc. etc.&quot; Yet, Shufeldt concludes, in order to be really effective, it needs an intelligent personnel and a thorough organization.&quot; Li Hongzhang evidently agreed, and sent Chinese students and officers to the United States and Germany for training. The Tientsin Arsenal developed the capacity to manufacture &quot;electric torpedoes,&quot; that is, what would now be called &quot;mines,&quot; US consul general, David Bailey reported that they were deployed in waterways along with other modern military weapons.

The Chinese armies which received the modern equipment and training were the Han Chinese Xiang Army, the Muslim Kansu Braves, and three Manchu Banner Divisions. The three Manchu divisions were destroyed in the Boxer Rebellion. The Xiang Army employed the new weaponry to achieve victory in the Dungan revolt, with German Dreyse Needle Guns and Krupp artillery. The Lanzhou arsenal in China in 1875 was able to produce modern European munitions and artillery by itself, with no foreign help. A Russian even saw the arsenal make &quot;steel rifle-barrelled breechloaders&quot;.

Chinese military officials were interested in western guns, and eagerly purchased them. Modern arsenals were established at places like Hanyang Arsenal, which produced German Mauser rifles and mountain guns. The Nanjing arsenal was making Hotchkiss, Maxim, and Nordenfeld guns in 1892. A Frenchman reported that China had the ability to reverse engineer any western weapon they needed. A British also noted that Chinese were efficient at reverse engineering foreign weapons and building their own versions. In the first Opium War the Chinese copied the British weapons and upgraded their military hardware while the fighting was going on. Tianjin arsenal made Dahlgren guns, 10,000 Remington rifles monthly, as of 1872. Li Hongzhang in 1890 added equipment, allowing it to make Maxim Machine guns, Nordenfelt cannons, Krupp guns, and ammunition for all of these. China was extremely familiar with R&amp;D on German military hardware. Gatling guns and other artillery were purchased by the Chinese military from western countries. Montigny mitrailleuse guns were also imported from France.

In addition to modern equipment, Chinese weapons, like fire arrows, light mortars, dadao swords, matchlocks, bows and arrows, crossbows, and halberds continued to be used alongside the western weaponry. Chinese gingal guns firing massive shells were used accurately, and inflicted severe wounds and death on the Allied troops during the Boxer Rebellion. In some cases, primitive weapons like Chinese spears were more effective than British bayonets in close quarter fighting.

During the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces deployed a weapon called &quot;electric mines&quot; on June 15, at the river Peiho river before the Battle of Dagu Forts (1900), to prevent the western Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack. This was reported by American military intelligence in the United States. War Dept. by the United States. Adjutant-General&#x27;s Office. Military Information Division. Different Chinese armies were modernized to different degrees by the Qing dynasty. For example, during the Boxer Rebellion, in contrast to the Manchu and other Chinese soldiers who used arrows and bows, the Muslim Kansu Braves cavalry had the newest carbine rifles. The Muslim Kansu Braves used the weaponry to inflict numerous defeats upon western armies in the Boxer Rebellion, in the Battle of Langfang, and, numerous other engagements around Tianjin.
 &quot;The Times&quot; noted that &quot;10,000 European troops were held in check by 15,000 Chinese braves&quot;. Chinese artillery fire caused a steady stream of casualties upon the western soldiers. During one engagement, heavy casualties were inflicted on the French and Japanese, and the British and Russians lost some men. Chinese artillerymen during the battle also learned how to use their German bought Krupp artillery accurately, outperforming European gunners. The Chinese artillery shells slammed right on target into the western armies military areas. After the skirmishes that ended the 55-day Siege of the International Legations by the Boxers, missionary Arthur Henderson Smith noted, &quot; ... whatever else the enterprise may have accomplished it disposed once for all of the favourite proposition so often advanced that it would be possible for a small but well organized and thoroughly equipped foreign force to march through China from end to end without effective opposition.&quot;

Historians have judged the Qing dynasty&#x27;s vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that &quot;China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go...In the Arrow War (1856–60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884–85). But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.&quot;

The Qing dynasty forced Russia to hand over disputed territory in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), in what was widely seen by the west as a diplomatic victory for the Qing. Russia acknowledged that Qing China potentially posed a serious military threat. Mass media in the west during this era portrayed China as a rising military power due to its modernization programs and as a major threat to the western world, invoking fears that China would successfully conquer western colonies like Australia.

==Military philosophy==

Chinese military thought&#x27;s most famous tome is Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot;, written in the Warring States Era. In the book, Sun Tzu laid out several important cornerstones of military thought, such as:
* The importance of intelligence.
* The importance of manoeuvring so your enemy is hit in his weakened spots.
* The importance of morale.
* How to conduct diplomacy so that you gain more allies and the enemy lose allies.
* Having the moral advantage.
* The importance of national unity.
* All warfare is based on deception.
* The importance of logistics.
* The proper relationship between the ruler and the general. Sun Tzu holds the ruler should not interfere in military affairs.
* Difference between Strategic and Tactical strategy.
* No country has benefited from a prolonged war.
* Subduing an enemy without using force is best.

Sun Tzu&#x27;s work became the cornerstone of military thought, which grew rapidly. By the Han dynasty, no less than 11 schools of military thought were recognized. During the Song dynasty, a military academy was established.

==Military exams and degrees==
==Equipment and technology==

In their various campaigns, the Chinese armies through the ages, employed a variety of equipment in the different arms of the army. The most notable weaponry used by the Chinese consisted of crossbows, bombs, rockets, land mines and other gunpowder weapons, but the Chinese also made many advances on conventional iron weapons such as swords and spears as well as crossbows, that were considered far superior to other contemporary weapons. However, the most notorious and iconic armament of Chinese armies, was the crossbow.

===Crossbow===
The crossbow, invented by the Chinese in the 7th century BC, was considered to be the most important weapon of the Chinese armies in ancient times. Crossbows could be given to a conscript with little training, and yet massed to devastating effect due to the ease of aiming the crossbow with greater precision compared to a traditional recurve bow. The crossbow also had greater firing velocity, and allowed a much deeper penetration into armor compared to traditional composite bows, which allowed Chinese armies to deploy huge amounts of firepower. In China, the crossbow was one of the primary military weapons from the Warring States period until the end of the Han dynasty, when armies were composed of up to 30 to 50 percent crossbowmen. Han soldiers were required to arm an &quot;entry level&quot; crossbow with a draw-weight of 76 kg/168 lb to qualify as an entry level crossbowman, while it was claimed that a few elite troops were capable of arming crossbows by the hands-and-feet method, with a draw-weight in excess of 340 kg/750 lb.

The mechanical design of the ancient Chinese crossbow was very complex, due to the nature of the firing mechanism. The mechanical design of the Chinese crossbow was so unique, that many experts including historian Homer Dubs claim that the Chinese crossbow firing mechanism was almost as complex as the modern-invention of the rifle, and could only be reproduced by very competent mechanics which only Chinese engineers could understand. This gave an additional advantage, as this made the crossbow &quot;capture-proof&quot; as even if China&#x27;s barbarian enemies captured them they would not be able to reproduce the weapon. Crossbow ammunition could also only be used in crossbows, and was useless in the conventional bows employed by China&#x27;s nomadic enemies.

In combat, crossbows were often fitted with grid sights to help aim, and several different sizes were used. During the Song dynasty, huge artillery crossbows were used that could shoot several bolts at once, killing many men at a time. Even cavalrymen were sometimes issued with crossbows. It was recorded that the crossbow could &quot;penetrate a large elm from a distance of 140 paces&quot;. The Repeating crossbow(also known as &quot;Chu Ko Nu&quot;) was invented during the Warring States period. Even though it could rapidly fire up to 7–10 bolts in 15–20 seconds, its firing power was weaker compared to a standard crossbow, and could not penetrate heavy armor as effectively. It was generally regarded as a non-military weapon suited for civilians, mostly used for defending against robbers or in times of self-defense.

===Gunpowder weapons===

As inventors of gunpowder, the Chinese were the first to deploy gunpowder weapons. A large variety of gunpowder weapons were produced, including guns, cannons, mines, the flamethrower, bombs, and rockets. After the rise of the Ming dynasty, China began to lose its lead in gunpowder weapons to the west. This became partially evident when the Manchus&#x27; began to rely on the Jesuits to run their cannon foundry, at a time when European powers had assumed the global lead in gunpowder warfare through their Military Revolution.

====Guns and cannons====

The first &quot;proto-gun&quot;, the fire lance, was introduced in 905 AD. This consisted of a bamboo or metal tube attached to a spear filled with gunpowder that could be ignited at will, with a range of five metres. It was capable of killing or maiming several soldiers at a time and was mass-produced and used especially in the defense of cities. Later versions of the fire lance dropped the spear point and had more gunpowder content.

Traditionally interpreted as a wind god, a sculpture in Sichuan was found holding a bombard, and the date must be as early as AD 1128 These cast-iron hand cannons and erupters were mostly fitted to ships and fortifications for defense.

Cannon were used by Ming dynasty forces at the Battle of Lake Poyang. Ming dynasty era ships had bronze cannon. One shipwreck in Shandong had a cannon dated to 1377 and an anchor dated to 1372. From the 13th to 15th centuries cannon armed Chinese ships also traveled throughout south east Asia.

====Bombs, grenades and mines====

High explosive bombs were another innovation developed by the Chinese in the 10th century. These consisted largely of round objects covered with paper or bamboo filled with gunpowder that would explode upon contact and set fire to anything flammable. These weapons, known as &quot;thunderclap bombs&quot;, were used by defenders in sieges on attacking enemies and also by trebuchets, which hurled huge numbers of them onto the enemy. A new improved version of these bombs, called the &quot;thunder-crash&quot; bomb, was introduced in the 13th century; it was covered in cast iron, was highly explosive, and hurled shrapnel at the enemy. These weapons were not only used by Song China, but also its Jur&#x27;chen and Mongol enemies. In the history of the Jur&#x27;chen Jin dynasty, the use of cast-iron gunpowder bombs against the Mongols is described.

By the time of the Ming dynasty, Chinese technology had progressed to making large land mines, many of them were deployed on the northern border.

====Flamethrower====

Flamethrowers were employed in naval combat in the Yangtze river, and large-scale use of the flamethrower is recorded in 975, when the Southern Tang navy employed flamethrowers against Song naval forces, but the wind blew the other way, causing the Southern Tang fleet to be immolated, and allowing the Song to conquer South China. During Song times, the flamethrower was used not only in naval combat but also in defense of cities, where they were placed on the city walls to incinerate any attacking soldiers.

====Rockets====
During the Ming dynasty, the design of rockets were further refined and multi-stage rockets and large batteries of rockets were produced. Multi-stage rockets were introduced for naval combat. Like other technology, knowledge of rockets were transmitted to the Middle East and the West through the Mongols, where they were described by Arabs as &quot;Chinese arrows&quot;.

===Infantry===

In the 2nd century BC, the Han began to produce steel from cast iron. New steel weapons were manufactured that gave Chinese infantry an edge in close-range fighting, though swords and blades were also used. The Chinese infantry were given extremely heavy armor in order to withstand cavalry charges, some 29.8 kg of armor during the Song dynasty.

===Cavalry===

The cavalry was equipped with heavy armor in order to crush a line of infantry, though light cavalry was used for reconnaissance. However, Chinese armies lacked horses and their cavalry were often inferior to their horse archer opponents. Therefore, in most of these campaigns, the cavalry had to rely on the infantry to provide support. Between the Jin and Tang dynasty, fully armored cataphracts were introduced in combat. An important innovation was the invention of the stirrup. From early Indian invention, which allowed cavalrymen to be much more effective in combat; this innovation later spread to East, north and west via the nomadic populations of central Asia and to the west by the Avars. However, some believe northern nomads were responsible for this innovation.

Some authors, such as Lynn White, claim the use of the stirrup in Europe stimulated development of the medieval knights which characterized feudal Europe. However, this thesis was disputed in the Great Stirrup Controversy by historians such as Bernard Bachrach, although it has been pointed out that the Carolingian riders may have been the most expert cavalry of all at its use.

===Chemical weapons===

During the Han dynasty, state manufacturers were producing stink bombs and tear gas bombs that were used effectively to suppress a revolt in 178 AD. Poisonous materials were also employed in rockets and crossbow ammunition to increase their effectiveness.

===Logistics===

The Chinese armies also benefited from a logistics system that could supply hundreds of thousands of men at a time. An important innovation by the Chinese was the introduction of an efficient horse harness in the 4th century BC, strapped to the chest instead of the neck, an innovation later expanded to a collar harness. This innovation, along with the wheelbarrow, allowed large-scale transportation to occur, allowing huge armies numbering hundreds of thousands of men in the field.

Chinese armies were also backed by a vast complex of arms-producing factories. State-owned factories turned out weapons by the thousands, though some dynasties (such as the Later Han) privatized their arms industry and acquired weapons from private merchants.

===Rations===

During the Han dynasty, Chinese developed methods of food preservation for military rations during campaigns such as drying meat into jerky and cooking, roasting, and drying grain.

==Command==

In early Chinese armies, command of armies was based on birth rather than merit. For example, in the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (771 BC–476 BC), command was delegated to the ruler, the crown prince, and the second son. By the time of the Warring States period, generals were appointed based on merit rather than birth, the majority of whom were talented individuals who gradually rose through the ranks.

Nevertheless, Chinese armies were sometimes commanded by individuals other than generals. For example, during the Tang dynasty, the emperor instituted &quot;Army supervisors&quot; who spied on the generals and interfered in their commands, although most of these practices were short-lived as they disrupted the efficiency of the army.

<text>Vladimir Nikolayevich Voinovich (; 26 September 1932 – 27 July 2018) was a Russian writer and former Soviet dissident, and the &quot;first genuine comic writer&quot; produced by the Soviet system. Among his most well-known works are the satirical epic &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot; and the dystopian &quot;Moscow 2042&quot;. He was forced into exile and stripped of his citizenship by Soviet authorities in 1980 but later rehabilitated and moved back to Moscow in 1990. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he continued to be an outspoken critic of Russian politics under the rule of Vladimir Putin.

Voinovich was born in Stalinabad, Tajik SSR, Soviet Union. According to himself, his father was of Serbian descent and a translator of Serbian literature, and his mother was of Jewish descent. Vladimir Voinovich claimed that his father belonged to the Serbian Vojnović noble family, although this is solely based on his surname and the book by the Yugoslavian writer Vidak Vujnovic &quot;Vojinovici i Vujinovici od srednjeg veka do danas&quot; (1985) which he received as a gift from the author during his stay in Germany.

In 1936 Voinovich&#x27;s father was arrested on the allegation of anti-Soviet agitation and spent five years in labor camps.

Voinovich began his studies in Moscow and tried to enter the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. After a failed attempt he entered the Moscow Krupskaya Pedagogical Institute, the faculty of history. According to his autobiography, he spent some time in Kazakhstan, &quot;seeking inspiration&quot;, and on his return to Moscow started working on his first novel.

===Literary debut and dissidence===
His earliest published books were &quot;We Live Here&quot; and &quot;I Want To Be Honest&quot;. In 1969 he published the first part of &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot;, a satirical novel about a Russian soldier during World War II. A second part was published in 1971. At the outset of the Brezhnev stagnation period, Voinovich&#x27;s writings stopped being published in the USSR, but continued publishing in samizdat, hand-written copies. and in the West. In 1974, the authorities began a systematic harassment of Voinovich due to his writing and his political attitude. Voinovich was excluded from the Soviet Writers&#x27; Union the same year. 

His telephone line was cut off in 1976. He and his family were forced to emigrate in 1980, being stripped of his citizenship. He settled in Munich, West Germany after being invited by the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. For a while he worked for Radio Liberty. Voinovich helped publish Vasily Grossman&#x27;s famous novel &quot;Life and Fate&quot; by smuggling photo films secretly taken by Andrei Sakharov. In 1987, he published the second of his arguably most well-known works, &quot;Moscow 2042&quot;. Mikhail Gorbachev restored his Soviet citizenship in 1990 and he subsequently moved back to Russia.

His literary agent was American attorney Leonard W. Schroeter.

===Public activism in Russia===
Voinovich continued to voice his political convictions also after the fall of the Soviet Union.

In 2001 Voinovich signed an open letter expressing support to the NTV channel, and in 2003 a letter against the Second Chechen War. On 25 February 2015 he published an &quot;Open Letter from Vladimir Voinovich to the President of Russia&quot; in which he asked Putin to release the Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko who went on a hunger strike. He stated that her death might have an even greater effect on the world&#x27;s opinion than the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas. In a 2015 interview with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Voinovich said that &quot;In some ways, it is worse today&quot; than during the Soviet era and that &quot;the freedoms we have are just leftovers.&quot; 

In an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in 2017, Voinovich also voiced criticism of President Putin, saying that Putin had turned the country in a more conservative direction at the expense of politics &quot;oriented toward the future.&quot; He repeated his opinion that the political situation in Russia today is comparable to the 1970s in the Soviet Union. &quot;They are breaking up demonstrations. They are throwing people in prison on basically the same charges. True, they aren&#x27;t giving seven-year sentences, but rather two. And now they have begun driving people out of the country&quot;, he noted.

===Personal life===
Voinovich was married three times. Between 1957 and 1964 he was married to Valentina Vasilievna Boltushkina (1929—1988). Together they had two children: daughter Marina Voinovich (1958—2006) and son Pavel Voinovich (born 1962), also a Russian writer and publicist, author of historical novels. His second wife was Irina Danilovna Braude (1938—2004). They had one daughter Olga Voinovich (born 1973), a German writer. Following Irina&#x27;s death in 2004 Voinovich married Svetlana Yakovlevna Kolesnichenko (née Lianozova), an entrepreneur, also a widow of the Russian journalist Tomas Kolesnichenko. They lived in Moscow.

He was a member of the board of trustees of the Vera hospice.

Vladimir Voinovich died on the night of 27 July 2018 of a heart attack.

==Work==
The first and second parts of his epic magnum opus &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot; (&quot;Жизнь и необычайные приключения солдата Ивана Чонкина&quot;) are set in the Red Army during World War II, satirically exposing the daily absurdities of the totalitarian regime. &quot;Chonkin&quot; is now a widely known figure in Russian popular culture. The book was also made into a film by the Czech director Jiří Menzel. Many have pointed out the similarities between the story about Chonkin and &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;. 

The third part of the novel was published in 2007. Not as well known so far as the previous two parts, it portrays the post-War life of the characters until the present, including Chonkin&#x27;s involuntary emigration to the USA. Much attention is also paid to the figures of Lavrentiy Beria and Joseph Stalin, the latter being mockingly depicted as a son of Nikolai Przhevalsky and a Przewalski&#x27;s horse. According to the author, the writing of the whole novel took him almost fifty years. The novel has been described as a Soviet &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

In 1986 he wrote a dystopian novel, &quot;Moscow 2042&quot; (published in 1987). In this novel, Voinovich portrayed a Russia ruled by the &quot;Communist Party of State Security&quot; combining the KGB, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Communist Party. This party is led by a KGB general Bukashev (the name means &quot;the bug&quot;) who meets the main character of the novel in Germany. A Slavophile, Sim Karnavalov (apparently inspired by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn), eventually overthrows the Party and enters Moscow on a white horse. The similarities between the plot of the book and the actual political developments in Russian following the fall of the Soviet Union have been noted by several observers.

Voinovich&#x27;s other novels have also won acclaim. &quot;The Fur Hat&quot; is a satire alluding to Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Overcoat&quot;. His &quot;Monumental Propaganda&quot; is a stinging critique of post-Communist Russia, a story that shows the author&#x27;s opinion that Russians haven&#x27;t changed much since the days of Joseph Stalin. &quot;Monumental Propaganda&quot; has been described as &quot;an illuminating comment on the persistence of false idols and historical delusions&quot;.

His darkly humorous memoir &quot;The Ivankiad&quot; tells the true story of his attempt to get an upgraded apartment in the bureaucratic clog of the Soviet system. 

In 2002 he published a controversial book of memoirs &quot;A Portrait Against the Background of a Myth&quot; highly critical of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Voinovich accused him of creating a cult around himself, of poor writing skills and his alleged antisemitism, among other things. The book received a mixed reaction. Yuri Semenov supported the point regarding &quot;Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s continuous degradation&quot; as a writer, but also criticized Voinovich for simultaneously &quot;glorifying himself and his books&quot;. 

Liza Novikova of Kommersant compared the book to performance art, suggesting that &quot;the author only helps creating the very same myth by trying to prove that Solzhenitsyn doesn&#x27;t match the rank of a great writer&quot;. The book was widely seen as a reaction to Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s two-volume historical work &quot;Two Hundred Years Together&quot; that was published in 2001–2002 and dedicated to the history of Jews in Russia and frequently regarded as antisemitic. Voinovich, however, said that he had started the work on his book before &quot;Two Hundred Years Together&quot; was even published and that he didn&#x27;t have patience to read it till the end.

He published his memoirs in 2010.

==Awards and honors==
Voinovich was awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation for 2000, for his book &quot;Monumental propaganda&quot; about Soviet Neo-Stalinist legacy sitting in the subconscious of almost every citizen of the &quot;free Russia&quot;. He also received Andrei Sakharov Prize for Writer&#x27;s Civic Courage (2002).

==History==

The region of Gurgaon originally fell under the Kuru Kingdom. Early people to inhabit the region were Hindus ruled over by the Ahir clan. Yadu tribes were a part of this clan and today their descendants commonly hold the last name &quot;Yadav&quot;. In late 4th century BCE, the city was absorbed by the Maurya Empire as part of Chandragupta Maurya&#x27;s earliest expansions of his kingdom.

Gurgaon may be same as the Gudapura town mentioned in the 12th century text &quot;Prithviraja Vijaya&quot;. According to the text, Nagarjuna, a cousin of the Chahamana king Prithviraj Chauhan, rebelled against the king and captured the town. Prithviraj crushed the rebellion and recaptured the town.

During the Mughal and initially during the British colonial era, Gurgaon was just a small village in Jharsa paragana of Delhi subah. Report of a Tour in Eastern Rajputana in 1882–83 (published in 1885) by Alexander Cunningham, the then Director-General of Archaeological Survey of India, he mentions a stone pillar at Gurgaon of a local feudal lord &quot;Durgga Naga&quot; with a 3-line inscription &quot;Samvat 729 or 928, Vaisakh badi 4, Durgga Naga lokatari bhuta&quot; dating back to 672 CE or 871 CE. Jharsa paragana passed to Begum Samru in 1776–77 and came under direct British rule in 1836 after her death when her territory was taken over by the British who established a civil lines at Jharsa and a cavalry cantonment at nearby Hiyadatpur. An 1882 land revenue settlement report records that the idol of Sitla Mata was brought to Gurgaon 400 years earlier (15th century). Begum Samru claimed the offering to Sitla Mata temple during the Chaitra month and the revenue from the offerings given to the deity for rest of the month was distributed among the prominent Jat zamindars of the area.
In 1818, Bharawas district was disbanded and Gurgaon was made a new district. In 1821, the Bharaswas cantonment was also moved to Hidayatpur in Gurgaon. &quot;Aliwardi mosque&quot; in Gurgaon, &quot;Badshahpur baoli&quot; (1905). and &quot;Bhondsi&quot; (16th to 17th century) were built during mughal and British era. The &quot;Church of the Epiphany&quot; and &quot;Kaman Serai&quot; (Corrupted form of the &quot;Command Serai&quot; or &quot;Officer&#x27;s Mess&quot;&quot;) was built by the Britishers in 1925 inside the civil lines.

Other British colonial era historic buildings The Gurgaon Club, a 3-room building surrounded by the lawn and currently run by the Zila Parishad, the erstwhile Coronation School—now renamed to the Government Boys&#x27; Senior Secondary School, one of the 13 school established in India in 1911 to commemorate the coronation of King George V. During 1980s, the airstrip and hangar, air conditioned yoga ashram and TV studio were built on outskirts of the city by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s yoga mentor Dhirendra Brahmachari. The former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar established his own ashram near this airstrip in 1983 on 600 acre of panchayat land, where another godman Chandraswami and notorious Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi used to visit him.

On 12 April 2016, Chief Minister of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar announced a proposal to officially rename the city &quot;Gurugram&quot; (Sanskrit: गुरुग्राम, lit. &quot;village of the Guru&quot;), subject to the approval of the Haryana cabinet and the Union Government. He argued that the new name would help to preserve the &quot;rich heritage&quot; of the city by emphasising its history and mythological association with Drona. On 27 September 2016, he officially announced that the Union Government had approved the name change, and thus the city and district would henceforth be known as Gurugram, though the old name &quot;Gurgaon&quot; still lingers in the colloquial usage.

===Languages and dialect===
The main language spoken in Gurgaon is Hindi, though a segment of the population understands and speaks English. The dialect used in Hindi is similar to that of Delhi, and is considered neutral, though the regional influences from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab adds an accent to the language. English is spoken with an Indian accent, with a primarily North Indian influence. Since Gurgaon has many international call centres, the employees are usually given formal training in neutral pronunciation in order to be understandable to native English speakers. Haryanvi and Punjabi are other popular languages spoken in the city.

===Sports===

==Economy==
Gurgaon has the third highest per-capita income in India and is the site of Indian offices for half of Fortune 500 companies. The city also benefits from its close proximity to Delhi.

Maruti Suzuki Private Limited was the first company that set up a manufacturing unit in the city in the 1970s, making cars. Eventually, DLF Limited, a real estate company, acquired vast stretches of land in the city. The first major American brand to set up a unit in Gurgaon was General Electric in 1997. GE&#x27;s setup in Gurgaon prompted other companies, both international and domestic, to follow suit providing outsourcing solutions in software, IT, service and sales through delivery facilities and call centres. However, due to the lack of proper public transport and the inability of most of the employees to afford a personal vehicle, most of the call centres provide pooled-in cars to and from their offices.

Apart from business process outsourcing and IT sectors, the city is home to several other companies. Siemens Industry Software, in Gurgaon Business Park, made a portfolio of design software that was used by NASA to digitally design, simulate and assemble the vehicle before any physical prototypes were built. Various international companies, including Coca-Cola, Pepsi, BMW, Agilent Technologies, and Hyundai, have chosen Gurgaon as their Indian corporate headquarters; this continues to in the 2020s, with Cargill and Nissan making the same choice. Companies with head offices in the city include Air India. IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Vistara.

Gurgaon is largest civilian aviation hub of India, with all major airlines such as Air India, AirAsia, IndiGo, SpiceJet etc. having their global headquarters in the city.

All the major companies in the city depend on their own backup, given the fact that Gurgaon does not have a reliable power and water supply, public transport or utilities. OMC Power is a distributed energy company headquartered in Gurgaon.

Retail is an important industry in Gurgaon, with the presence of 26 shopping malls.

==Law and government==
Gurgaon is governed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, which follows a mayor-council system. In 2017, the GMDA (Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority) was formed, which looks after the city&#x27;s infrastructure.

==Crime==
As per the authorities, the following is the key crime data of Gurgaon for 2022:

Fire protection within the city limits is provided by Municipal Corporation of Gurugram through four fire stations, located in sector 29, sector 37, Udyog Vihar and Bhim Nagar.

In 2018, the first cyber police station was inaugurated in the city. As per the authorities, around 1,500 complaints related to cybercrime, including cyber fraud, online banking fraud, cheating through bank cards, social media complaints &amp; data theft, are received every month. Due to a shortage of in-house cyber experts, the police largely outsource such cases to external organisations.

== Education ==

There are other schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and International Baccalaureate boards.

== Transport ==
=== Roadways ===
The major highway that links Gurgaon is National Highway 48, the road that runs from Delhi to Mumbai. While the Delhi-Gurgaon border-Kherki Dhaula stretch has been developed as the Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway, the rest is expanded to six lanes.

=== Railways ===
==== Intercity rail ====
Gurgaon railway station is operated by Northern Railway of Indian Railways. The rail station forms a part of the larger Indian Railways network. Along with that, Gurgaon has Tajnagar railway station, Dhankot railway station, Ghari Harsaru Railway Junction and Farrukhnagar Railway Station, Patli Railway Station. Under Modernisation of Railway Stations, Indian Railways is modernising four railway stations in Gurgaon. Gurgaon railway station, Ghari Harsaru Railway Junction and Farrukhnagar Railway Station will be developed and modernised with modern amenities and international facilities.

==== Delhi Metro ====
There are five stations served by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. located on the Yellow Line, which are Millennium City Centre, IFFCO Chowk, MG Road, Sikanderpur and Guru Droncharya.

There are plans to extend metro coverage in future.

====Rapid Metro====
The Rapid Metro has eleven stations in Gurgaon, with an interchange with Yellow Line of Delhi Metro at Sikanderpur metro station. The Rapid Metro became operational in November 2013 and currently covers a distance of . One more phase of the project is in the pipeline and would take the total number of subway stations in the city to 16. An estimated 33,000 people ride the Rapid Metro every day, which provides an exclusive elevated transit service with three coach trains that run in a loop.

=== Airways ===
==== Airport ====
Gurgaon is served by Delhi&#x27;s Indira Gandhi International Airport, which is located just outside of Gurgaon city limits near National Highway 8.

=== Transit systems ===
==== Public transit ====
In November 2013, Gurgaon launched an &quot;Ciclovia&quot;-inspired initiative known as &quot;Raahgiri Day&quot;—in which a corridor of streets is closed to motor vehicle traffic on Sunday mornings to encourage the use of non-motorized transport and participation in outdoor leisure activities. Gurgaon was the first city in India to implement such a program, followed by New Delhi, and later Noida.

Gurgaon is also expected to get India&#x27;s first pod taxis.

== Utilities ==
Electricity in Gurgaon is provided by the government-owned Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam. Gurgaon has a power consumer base of 360,000 with an average power load of 700-800 MW. There are frequent power outages in the city, especially during the peak consumption season of summer. Apart from the power deficit, the equipment used by the power department like transformers, panels and transmission lines are either old or overburdened.

== Issues ==
=== Abusive workculture ===
Gurgaon is infamous for its toxic workculture and abusive work culture, even compared to other cities such as Bangalore, Pune and Navi Mumbai where workculture is far better.

=== Flooding ===
Gurgaon is notorious for its urban floods every monsoon. The areas on NH-8 around Hero Honda Chowk, Basai, Dhankot, sector 37 etc. see massive urban floods and headlines grabbing traffic jams reported widely in news media. A recent research report puts the blame on the broken natural water body linkage and obstructions in the flow in the city due to frantic construction during the last decades. The HUDA master drainage lines get choked or burst at the seams. Disruptions in the hydrological flow of natural drains and limited drainage capacity are all primary reasons for the floods.

Gurgaon&#x27;s Ghata Jheel, Badshahpur Jheel, Khandsa Talab were linked to Najafgarh drain which links to Yamuna river, via natural water channels and drains.

As per the ground reports and research, the three natural water bodies are struggling for their existence with encroachments on their lands and natural channels. Agencies responsible have tried to create artificial water bodies to compensate, but the efforts fail due to unpredictable rain and water flow patterns leading to deployment of water pumps to fight the situation.

In 2012 Punjab &amp; Haryana High court banned ground water usage for construction activity, and NGT has recently reprimanded authorities for drain concretisation.

<doc id="839756" wikidata="Q209672" url="?curid=839756" title="Cult following">
<text>A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a person, idea, object, movement, or work, often an artist, in particular a performing artist, or an artwork in some medium. The latter is often called a cult classic. A film, book, musical artist, television series, or video game, among other things, is said to have a cult following when it has a very passionate fanbase.

A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or anti-establishment to be appreciated by the general public or to be widely commercially successful.

Many cult fans express their devotion with a level of irony when describing such entertainment. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters.

==Film==
There is not always a clear difference between cult and mainstream media. Professors Xavier Mendik and Ernest Mathijs, authors of &quot;100 Cult Films&quot;, argue that the devoted following among these films make them cult classics. In many cases, films that have cult followings may have been financial flops during their theatrical box office run, and even received mixed or mostly negative reviews by mainstream media, but are still considered a major success by small core groups or communities of fans.

Some cults are only popular within a certain subculture. The film &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970) is especially loved within the hippie subculture, while &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993) holds cult status among American women born in the 1980s and early 1990s. Certain mainstream icons can become cult icons in a different context for certain people. &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (1936) was originally intended to warn youth against the use of marijuana, but because of its ridiculous plot, overwhelming number of factual errors and cheap look, it became watched by audiences of marijuana smokers and has gained a cult following.

Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s films borrow stylistically from classic cult films, but are appreciated by a large audience; therefore, Tarantino&#x27;s filmography is noted worldwide as lying somewhere between cult and mainstream cinema. Also, certain cult phenomena can grow to such proportions that they become mainstream, such as the filmography of cult directors like John Waters, John Sayles, John Cassavetes, Armando Bó, Eliseo Subiela, Ruggero Deodato, Takeshi Kitano, Abbas Kiarostami or Jesús Franco.

==Television==

Certain television series develop a cult following after their cancellation, which may cause interest in renewal. &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, which was cancelled in 2006 after its third season, was renewed by Netflix in 2013 and received two additional seasons. &quot;Futurama&quot; was cancelled in 2003 after its fourth season on Fox, but was later picked up by Comedy Central for an additional three seasons. In 2022, it was announced the series would be renewed for 20 additional episodes (released weekly) on the streaming service Hulu. &quot;Star Trek&quot; was cancelled after three seasons, but in broadcast syndication it gained a more substantial following, ultimately spawning a successful media franchise.

David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; ran on ABC for two seasons from 1990 to 1991, initially garnering high ratings and critical acclaim. Ratings and reception declined following the reveal of Laura Palmer&#x27;s murderer, who was left intentionally unknown by Lynch. Eventually, the show was canceled, ending on a cliffhanger. It was not until 2017 that Twin Peaks returned as a limited series on Showtime, ending one of the longest hiatuses in television history.

Series often considered cult classics include the long-running BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the ITC sci-fi thriller series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, the Australian soap opera &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;, the Indian soap opera that ran for eight years Kasautii Zindagii Kay and the mock animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; aired on Cartoon Network, which then spawned many spin-offs and other shows that had a similar sense of humor as &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; when Adult Swim became a block on the network. A large proportion of the titles aforementioned within this article might not be considered cult classics due to their wide saturation within contemporary audiences, though the term cult classics may have loose classifications such as an initially unsuccessful release or large number of cliches (intentional or otherwise) leading to such a broad range of classification relative to personal experiences of its assigner.

== Video games ==
Some video games, often those with unique concepts that fail to gain traction with the mainstream audience, attract cult followings and can influence the design of later video games. An example of a cult video game is &quot;Ico&quot; (2001), an initial commercial flop that gained a large following for its unique gameplay and minimalist aesthetics, and was noted as influencing the design of &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;Rime&quot; (2017), among other games. Other games that have cult followings include &quot;EarthBound&quot; (1994), another unsuccessful game that later resulted in the creation of a &quot;cottage industry&quot; selling memorabilia to the &quot;EarthBound&quot; fandom; &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; (2001), an unusually mature 3D platform game for the Nintendo 64 celebrated for its dark humor and story; &quot;Yume Nikki&quot; (2004), a surreal free-to-play Japanese horror game; &quot;Psychonauts&quot; (2005), an initially unsuccessful platformer that has consistently kept one of the strongest fan followings; &quot;&quot; (2006), considered to many long-time fans of the &quot;Hitman&quot; franchise to be the first and last great &quot;Hitman&quot; game, despite its outdated controls and gameplay, and not receiving deserved acclaim at the time; &quot;Alan Wake&quot; (2010), an action-adventure game whose story is modeled similar to a thriller television series format and has gained loyal followings despite its underselling; &quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot; (2012), a critically acclaimed third-person shooter known for its portrayal of the &quot;horrors of war&quot; and the deep psychological impact of armed conflict on soldiers; &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; (1998), a realistic and unforgiving racing simulation of the 1967 Formula One season; and &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot; (2006), a construction and management simulation and roguelike indie video game known for its roguelike cuboidal-grid world model and sometimes difficult text-based interface, rich and complex simulation gameplay, similarly rich procedural world generation and history of continuous development by a small team which continues .

== Music ==
One of the earliest cult classics in rock was The Velvet Underground&#x27;s 1967 debut album, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;. While hugely influential, it originally flopped commercially and alienated radio stations, music retailers, and magazines, who found the content too controversial to market. Over the next decade, it received greater recognition from rock critics, who helped make the album more popular. The Beatles&#x27; self-titled album known as &quot;The White Album&quot; at first received mixed reviews from music critics who considered its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968, but later attracted acclaim, and has since become a cult classic. The Zombies&#x27; 1968 album &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; was also originally a critical and commercial flop, failing to chart despite its single &quot;Time of the Season&quot; becoming a surprise hit the following year. While the Zombies disbanded just before its release, the album&#x27;s status grew as a cult classic in the following decades. David Bowie&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; also did not impact the record charts on its original release while receiving mixed reviews from critics. After Bowie achieved mainstream success in the early 1970s, its 1972 reissue reached number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, but only 105 in the US. &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;″s influence on future musicians, such as The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Gary Numan, as well as the dark wave genre, lent it a cult following in the music scene.

Punk rock has produced several albums with cult followings. The Ramones&#x27; 1976 self-titled debut album sold poorly, but was hugely influential on the then-young punk movement, and eventually sold well enough to earn a gold sales certification in 2014. The British post-punk band Magazine also released their debut, &quot;Real Life&quot; (1978), to little popular success, reaching only number 29 in the UK. Its subsequent acclaim as an innovative and influential work in the burgeoning post-punk genre earned it a reputation as a cult classic. In 1982, the American hardcore punk band Bad Brains released their self-titled debut exclusively on cassette, struggling to gain an audience in the vinyl-dominated marketplace. The appearance of the single &quot;Pay to Cum&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Let Them Eat Jellybeans!&quot; (1981) helped &quot;Bad Brains&quot; develop a following in the UK, while the album&#x27;s musical innovation and growing influence later ensured it a cult-classic status among followers of hardcore punk.

Some alternative albums have also developed cult followings. The American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails released their 1989 debut &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; to modest success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 75. It developed an underground popularity in subsequent years and sold enough to receive a platinum RIAA certification in 1995, becoming one of the first independently released albums to accomplish the feat. Also in 1989, Nirvana&#x27;s debut album &quot;Bleach&quot; was released to some positive notice from critics, but failed to impact record charts, until the band&#x27;s massively successful 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot; drew further interest to it. Radiohead&#x27;s albums &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; both received mixed reviews from fans and critics, but later attracted some praise and became cult classics.

The R&amp;B singer Bilal&#x27;s second album, &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, became a cult classic after leaking in 2006 and being notoriously shelved by Interscope Records. The musically experimental album quickly developed a following and acclaim online, becoming what &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writer Craig D. Lindsey called &quot;the black-music equivalent of Fiona Apple&#x27;s once-shelved (and also notoriously bootlegged) album &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot;&quot;.

Japanese dub and dream pop band Fishmans gained a dedicated online cult following after the death of frontman Shinji Sato via word-of-mouth spread on imageboard and music forum sites throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

== Advertising ==

Brands can also attain a cult following, sometimes due to prestige like Apple and Supreme, while others like Spam do so for cultural reasons. There are also many cult car brands ranging from Trabant to Volvo and even specific models like the Fiat 500, Ford Crown Victoria and Toyota AE86 have all spawned dedicated followings within the car enthusiast community.

In September 2021, AMC Theatres began airing a commercial starring actress Nicole Kidman in its theaters and on television. The commercial became a surprise hit among audiences, who came to appreciate the unintentional campiness of its earnestly rhapsodic style and script, particularly the line &quot;Somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.&quot; It has inspired internet memes, parodies, and in-theatre audience participation rituals.

<doc id="839778" wikidata="Q6723318" url="?curid=839778" title="Mach Five">
<text>The is the fictional racing car which appears in the anime series &quot;Speed Racer&quot; (known as &quot;Mach Go! Go! Go!&quot; in Japan) and its adaptations, including TV anime series and live-action films. The car has a set of special devices the driver can deploy with buttons on the steering wheel.

== Design ==
Mach Five was designed by Mitsuki Nakamura, who was the art director of Tatsunoko Production, which produced the 1967 TV anime series.

The initial plan was to keep the original manga design for the anime production, but it was decided to redesign the car, and Nakamura, a car enthusiast, was entrusted with the task.
Nakamura scoured photographic materials and designed the car in reference to the Porsche, Ferrari and Jaguar race cars of the time.
The car&#x27;s special devices and other settings were conceived by Tatsunoko&#x27;s literary section.

Mach Five&#x27;s design remained timeless and modern half a century after its birth, and passed muster for the Wachowskis&#x27; 2008 live-action film adaptation with few changes 40 years later.

== Works featuring Mach Five ==
=== Original Japanese TV anime series ===
&quot;Speed Racer&quot; (known as &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; in Japan) is the first series produced in Japan in 1967 based on the manga.

Mach Five is the racing car driven by &quot;Speed Racer&quot; (&quot;Go Mifune&quot; in the Japanese version), whose car was designed, manufactured, and created by &quot;Pops Racer&quot; (Daisuke Mifune), Speed Racer&#x27;s father. The car is a two-seater, left-hand drive car with no detailed specifications other than that it is powered by a V12 engine.
The body is painted white and blue with the letter &quot;M&quot; written on the hood.

The car has seven special functions, each of which is controlled by a button on the steering wheel assigned to each initial from A to G.

=== American remake ===
&quot;The New Adventures of Speed Racer&quot; is a remake series produced in the United States in 1993, and has not been released in Japan.

Mach Five&#x27;s design was full redesigned.

=== Japanese remake ===
This was a remake produced in Japan in 1997 and was the second TV series broadcast in Japan. The title in Japan is &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot;, and overseas it is called &quot;Speed Racer Y2K&quot;, &quot;Speed Racer X,&quot; or &quot;Mach Go Go Go: Restart&quot;. 

The design of Mach Five follows the front part of the previous body shape, but the rear part has been significantly modified. The car was changed from a two-seater to a three-seater with a center cockpit.

The new Mach Five functions a little differently than before.
=== American sequel ===
&quot;Speed Racer: The Next Generation&quot; was produced in the United States in 2008 as a sequel that takes place about 40 years after the events in the original anime. The series has not been released in Japan.

The design is almost the same as the original anime, but, the wheel rims have been changed from the original silver-white to black, and it is animated in CGI like all of the cars in the series.

=== Film ===
The Mach Five appears in the live-action film adaptation &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, directed by the Wachowski siblings and released by Warner Bros. Pictures. 

Mach Five was almost identical in design to the original anime and was used in the film&#x27;s main races with an actual vehicle. However, the car was rarely driven on real roads, instead it was hung on a crane and the effects were generated by computer graphics. 

The film portrays the Mach Five as initially a street legal family vehicle, allowing for it to feature a rear compartment that Spritle and Chim-Chim later use to stow away in the vehicle. The Mach Five is later modified with gadgets and becomes Speed&#x27;s alternate car for off-track races such as the Casa Cristo 5000, as well as everyday driving like a normal car. The Mach Five originally belonged to Speed&#x27;s older brother Racer X. Rex, who relinquished ownership of it to Speed before he left the Racer home. 

Along with the Mach Five, the movie features the &quot;Mach 4&quot; and the &quot;Mach 6&quot;, two different single-seater cars created specifically for stunt races. The designs of the Mach 4 and Mach 6 are vaguely reminiscent of the Mach Five&#x27;s (as in the original American comics), although the only functions the Mach 6 features are the jump jacks, which are standard equipment in race cars in the movie. 
Little about the Mach 4 is known, as it appears only briefly in the film and is portrayed as a red-colored companion to the 6.
Speed&#x27;s main car for races on the WRL track (Thunderhead, etc.) is the Mach 6. The Mach 6 was destroyed in a fixed race, but was later rebuilt for the film&#x27;s final race.

==Real-life replicas==
In 1997, a replica of the Mach Five, which was based on Nissan&#x27;s entry-level race car, the Saurus, modified and covered with an FRP body, was produced to promote the Japanese anime remake. It was unveiled at the time of the TV broadcast in Japan, and later ran again at the Toyota Automobile Museum in 2010.

In 2000, a prototype of the Mach Five replica with retractable saw blade was sold at a charity auction on E-Bay in 2000.
In 2002, 100 product models of Mach Five replica were planned to be manufactured as road-legal vehicles.
The body, built on the 2001 Chevrolet Corvette platform, was to be extensively modified to look like the Mach Five.
The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California has a mid-engine prototype of the Mach Five in its collection.

In 2008, after the premiere of the film &quot;Speed Racer&quot; at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, California, the actual racing car used in the film was unveiled.

A full-scale replica of the Mach Five was exhibited at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. It was produced in connection with a project by Japanese chocolate maker Tyrol Choco, in which Mach Five miniature cars were given away through a lottery.

==Mach Five in popular culture==
*A &quot;Speed Racer&quot;-themed catamaran, named after the franchise, was built in 2005, designed to resemble the Mach 5.
*&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine released an article about a &quot;real&quot; Mach 5 prototype car on 31 March 2008 (the day before April 1st), about a &quot;genuine running model&quot; made for the 2008 film. The article included performance data and feature descriptions for the car that was &quot;in a league by itself&quot;.
*In the online typing game, Nitro Type, it was available as an achievement car for completing 30,000 races and is renamed the &quot;Wach 6&quot;. It was created as a commemoration to the player CarriePirc for being the first person to reach 30,000 races on one singular account.
*The Mach Five is featured in the 2018 movie &quot;Ready Player One&quot; during a car racing scene.

<text>Squier is an American brand of electric guitars owned by Fender. The former manufacturing company, established as &quot;V. C. Squier Company&quot; was founded in 1890 by Victor Carroll Squier in Battle Creek, Michigan, producing strings for violins, banjos, and guitars. In 1965, the company was acquired by Fender. 

By 1975, Squier became defunct as a manufacturer and a brand name for strings, as Fender opted to market its strings under the Fender brand name. In 1982, the Squier name was reactivated by Fender as its brand for lower priced versions of Fender guitars. Squier guitars have been manufactured in the United States, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and China .

==History==

===V.C. Squier Company (1890–1981)===
Jerome Bonaparte Squier, a young English immigrant who arrived in Battle Creek, Michigan, in the latter part of the 19th century, was a farmer and shoemaker who had learned the fine European art of violin making. He moved to Boston in 1881, where he built and repaired violins with his son, Victor Carroll Squier. To this day, their violins are noted for their exceptional varnishes, and they command high prices as fine examples of early U.S. instrument craftsmanship. Indeed, Squier was ranked among the best-known U.S.-trained violin makers and is often referred to as &quot;the American Stradivarius.&quot;

Victor Carroll Squier returned to Battle Creek, where he opened his own shop in 1890. As his business grew, Squier moved the company to 429 Lake Ave. and eventually to 427 Capitol Ave, S.W.—the famous &quot;fiddle factory&quot; of Battle Creek. With a limited market for violins in Battle Creek, however, Squier astutely sought relationships with national music schools and famous violinists.

Up to 1900, the best violin strings were made in Europe. Victor Squier started making his own hand-wound violin strings, and the business grew so quickly that he and his employees improvised a dramatic production increase by converting a treadle sewing machine into a string winder capable of producing 1,000 uniformly high-quality strings per day. Squier violin strings, banjo strings and guitar strings became well known nationwide and were especially popular among students because of their reasonable price.

In the 1930s, Squier began making strings for the era&#x27;s new electric instruments; the company also sold pianos, radios and phonograph records until divesting itself of all products other than strings in 1961. Fender Electric Instruments entered the picture in the 1950s, when the V. C. Squier Company began supplying Southern California inventor and businessman Leo Fender with strings for his unusual new electric guitars. The V. C. Squier Company became an official original equipment manufacturer for Fender in 1963. Fender acquired the V. C. Squier Company in early 1965, shortly before Fender itself was acquired by CBS in May of the same year. By the mid-1970s, the Squier name was retired as the strings had taken the Fender name. The company itself was shuttered along with its Battle Creek factory in 1981.

=== Squier Guitars brand (1982–present) ===

Before the Squier line of guitars was introduced in 1982, Fender was making lower priced guitars such as the Fender Lead series at its Fullerton, California plant. Until the introduction of the Fender Squier series, Fender had never produced lower priced guitars based on its main Stratocaster and Telecaster models and had always used different model designs for its lower priced guitars.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Fender was facing competition from lower priced Japanese copies. The higher priced Fender guitars were made in the United States and could not compete with the lower prices of Japanese made Fender copies. In the early 1980s, Japanese labor and production costs were much lower than in America and to compete with the Japanese made guitars, Fender moved the lower priced Fender guitar production from America to Japan.

Fender was also losing sales in Japan to Japanese guitar brands such as Tōkai, Greco and Fernandes and the establishment of Fender Japan would benefit Fender sales in Japan, as well as overseas. Fender began negotiations with several Japanese musical instrument distributors and reached an agreement with Yamano Gakki and Kanda Shokai to establish Fender Japan. Yamano Gakki was known for once being part of Epiphone Japan. Kanda Shokai owned the Greco brand name and one of the conditions of the Fender Japan agreement was that Kanda Shokai cease production of its own Greco Fender copies. This arrangement benefited Fender because it removed the Greco Fender copies from the Japanese market, which were selling in Japan at much lower prices than the American made Fenders and it also benefited Kanda Shokai because Kanda Shokai could then distribute Japanese made Fender branded guitars in Japan. Further negotiations between Fender and Japanese guitar factories took place. Tokai was seriously considered to start building the first Japanese made Fenders, but after a breakdown in negotiations, FujiGen Gakki was chosen instead.

The initial Squier models were launched on July/August 1982. Over time, the Squier series slowly evolved to include original model designs and production has moved from Japan to various other Asian countries such as Korea, China and Indonesia. These guitars were massively successful and some of the Squier guitars were turned into Fender guitars.

<doc id="839807" wikidata="Q389654" url="?curid=839807" title="Greco-Roman wrestling">
<text>Greco-Roman (American English), Graeco-Roman (British English), or classic wrestling (Euro-English) is a style of wrestling that is practiced worldwide. Greco-Roman wrestling was included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has been in every edition of the summer Olympics held since 1904. This style of wrestling forbids holds below the waist, which is the main feature that differentiates it from freestyle wrestling (the other form of wrestling contested at the Olympics). This restriction results in an emphasis on throws, because a wrestler cannot use trips to bring an opponent to the ground or hook/grab the opponent&#x27;s leg to avoid being thrown.

Greco-Roman wrestling is one of several forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally. The other wrestling disciplines sanctioned by United World Wrestling are: men&#x27;s freestyle wrestling, women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling, grappling (submission wrestling), pankration, Alysh (belt wrestling), Pahlavani wrestling, and beach wrestling.

== History ==

The name &quot;Greco-Roman&quot; applied to this style of wrestling as a way of purporting it to be similar to the wrestling formerly found in the ancient civilizations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea especially at the ancient Greek Olympics. At that time, the athletes initially wore skintight shorts but later wrestled each other naked.

It is speculated that many styles of European folk wrestling may have spurred the origins of Greco-Roman wrestling. According to United World Wrestling, a Napoleonic soldier named Jean Exbrayat first developed the style. Exbrayat performed in fairs and called his style of wrestling &quot;flat hand wrestling&quot; to distinguish it from other forms of hand-to-hand combat that allowed striking. In 1848, Exbrayat established the rule that no holds below the waist were to be allowed; neither were painful holds or torsions that would hurt the opponent. &quot;Flat hand wrestling&quot; or &quot;French wrestling&quot; (as the style became known) developed all throughout Europe and became a popular sport. The Italian wrestler Basilio Bartoletti first coined the term &quot;Greco-Roman&quot; for the sport to underline the interest in &quot;ancient values.&quot; 
Many others in the 18th and 20th centuries sought to add value to their contemporary athletic practices by finding some connections with ancient counterparts. The 18th century work &quot;Gymnastics for Youth&quot; by Johann Friedrich Guts Muths described a form of schoolboy wrestling called &quot;orthopale&quot; (used by Plato to describe the standing part of wrestling) that did not mention any lower-body holds. Real ancient wrestling was quite different; see Greek wrestling.
The British never really enjoyed Greco-Roman wrestling in comparison to its less restrictive counterpart, freestyle wrestling, and neither did the Americans, despite the efforts of William Muldoon (a successful New York barroom freestyle wrestler who served in the Franco-Prussian War and learned the style in France) to promote it in the United States after the Civil War. However, on the continent of Europe, the style was highly promoted. Almost all the continental European capital cities hosted international Greco-Roman tournaments in the 19th century, with much prize money given to the place winners. For example, the Czar of Russia paid 500 francs for wrestlers to train and compete in his tournament, with 5,000 francs awarded as a prize to the tournament winner. Greco-Roman wrestling soon became prestigious in continental Europe. It was the first style registered at the modern Olympic Games, beginning in Athens in 1896 with one heavyweight bout, and grew in popularity during the 20th century. It has always been featured in the Olympic Games, except during the Paris Olympic Games in 1900 and the St. Louis Olympic Games of 1904, when freestyle first emerged as an Olympic sport.

Perhaps the most well-known of Greco-Roman wrestlers in the 19th century was Georg Hackenschmidt born in Dorpat, Russian Empire, and nicknamed &quot;The Russian Lion&quot;. Hackenschmidt in 1898 at the age of 21 and with 15 months of training defeated the experienced Paul Pons in a match in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 1900, he won professional tournaments in Moscow and St. Petersburg and a series of international tournaments after that. After defeating Tom Jenkins (from the United States) in both freestyle and Greco-Roman matches in England, Georg Hackenschmidt wrestled exclusively freestyle in order to compete better against English, Australian, and American opponents. Winning more than 2,000 victories in Greco-Roman and freestyle, Hackenschmidt served as the physical education adviser to the House of Lords after his retirement.

Professional matches in Greco-Roman wrestling were known for their great brutality. Body slams, choke-holds, and head-butting was allowed, and even caustic substances were used to weaken the opponent. By the end of the 19th century, gouging with the nails, punching, and violently slamming the arms together around the opponent&#x27;s stomach were forbidden. Greco-Roman matches were also famous for their length. Professionally, it was not uncommon for there to be matches lasting two or three hours. William Muldoon&#x27;s bout with Clarence Whistler at the Terrace Garden Theater in New York lasted eight hours before ending in a draw. Even in the 1912 Olympics, a match between Martin Klein of Russia (Estonia) and Alfred Asikainen of Finland lasted for eleven hours and forty minutes before Martin Klein won. He received the silver medal because he was too tired to compete in final match next day. That record was later published at &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF) took over the regulation of Greco-Roman wrestling in 1921. Since then matches have been dramatically cut short, and today all movements that put the life or limb of the wrestler in jeopardy are forbidden. Professional wrestler Lou Thesz, who initially trained extensively in Greco-Roman, popularised the Greco-Roman backdrop during early televised professional matches.

In Olympic competition, countries of the former Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Turkey, South Korea, Romania, Japan, Sweden, and Finland have had great success. Carl Westergren of Sweden won three Greco-Roman gold medals in 1920, 1924, and 1932, and was the first Greco-Roman wrestler to do so. Alexander Karelin did the same in 1988, 1992, and 1996. Ivar Johansson of Sweden won gold medals in Greco-Roman in 1932 and 1936 and also a gold medal in freestyle in 1932. The United States Olympic delegation (exclusively wrestling freestyle before) first entered Greco-Roman wrestling in 1952 and has taken three gold medals, won by Steve Fraser and Jeffrey Blatnick in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and by Rulon Gardner at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

==Weight classes==

Currently, international Greco-Roman wrestling is divided into five main age categories: U15, U17 (Cadets), U20 (Juniors), Seniors U23, or Seniors. For men, there is also a special category for some Greco-Roman competitions, &quot;Veterans&quot;, for men ages 35 and older, presumably featuring the same weight classes as seniors. Also, all of the men&#x27;s age categories and weight classes can be applied to freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers after weigh-in may only wrestle in their own weight class. Wrestlers in the senior age category may wrestle up a weight class except for the heavyweight division (which starts at a weight more than 96 kg for the men). Different nations may have different weight classes and different age categories for their levels of Greco-Roman competition.

==Structure of tournament==

A typical international wrestling tournament takes place by direct elimination with an ideal number of wrestlers (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.) in each weight class and age category competing for placement. The competition in each weight class takes place in one day. The day before the wrestling in a scheduled weight class and age category takes place, all the applicable wrestlers are examined by a physician and weighed-in. Each wrestler after being weighed on the scale then draws a token randomly that gives a certain number.

If an ideal number is not reached to begin elimination rounds, a qualification round will take place to eliminate the excess number of wrestlers. For example, 22 wrestlers may weigh-in over the ideal number of 16 wrestlers. The six wrestlers who drew the highest numbers after 16 and the six wrestlers who drew the six numbers immediately before 17 would then wrestle in six matches in the qualification round. The winners of those matches would then go on to the elimination round.

In the &quot;elimination round&quot;, the ideal number of wrestlers then pair off and compete in matches until two victors emerge who will compete in the finals for first and second place. All of the wrestlers who lost to the two finals then have the chance to wrestle in a &quot;repechage round&quot;. The repechage round begins with the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists at the lowest level of competition in the elimination round. The matches are paired off by the wrestlers who lost to one finalist and the wrestlers who lost to the other. The two wrestlers who win after every level of competition are the victors of the repechage round.

In the &quot;finals&quot;, the two victors of the elimination round compete for first and second place.

In all rounds of the tournament, the wrestlers compete in matches paired off in the order of the numbers they drew after the weigh-in.

After the finals match, the awards ceremony will take place. The first place and second place wrestlers will receive a gold and silver medal, respectively. (At the FILA World Championships, the first place wrestler will receive the World Championship Belt.) The two repechage round winners will each be awarded third place with a bronze medal. The two wrestlers who lost in the finals for the third place are awarded fifth place. From seventh place down, the wrestlers are ranked according to the classification points earned for their victories or losses. If there is a tie among wrestlers for classification points, the ranking is determined in this order from the highest to the lowest:
* Most victories earned by fall
* Most matches won by technical superiority
* Most periods won by technical superiority
* Most technical points scored in the tournament
* Least technical points scored in the tournament
Wrestlers who remained tied after that will be awarded placements &quot;ex aequo&quot;. Wrestlers classified from the fifth to the 10th place will receive a special diploma. The wrestling tournaments in the Olympic Games and the Senior and Junior World Championships are designed to take place over three days on three mats.

==Layout of the mat==

The match takes place on a thick rubber circular mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a 1.5 meter border of the same thickness known as the &quot;protection area&quot;. Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the &quot;red zone&quot;. The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the &quot;passivity zone&quot;. Inside the red zone is the &quot;central wrestling area&quot; which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central wrestling area is the &quot;central circle&quot;, which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers&#x27; colors, red and blue.

For competition in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than 1.1 meters in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters, then the sides of the podium are covered with 45° (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat.

==Equipment==
* A &quot;singlet&quot; is a one-piece wrestling garment made of spandex that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from nylon or lycra and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. One wrestler usually competes in a red singlet and the other in a blue singlet.
* A special pair of &quot;shoes&quot; is worn by the wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement. Usually made with rubber soles, they help give the wrestler&#x27;s feet a better grip on the mat.
* A &quot;handkerchief&quot;, also called a &quot;bloodrag&quot;, is carried in the singlet. In the event of bleeding, the wrestler will remove the cloth from his singlet and attempt to stop the bleeding or clean up any bodily fluids that may have gotten onto the mat.
*&quot;Headgear&quot;, equipment worn around the ears to protect the wrestler, is optional in Greco-Roman. Headgear is omitted at the participant&#x27;s own risk, as there is the potential to develop cauliflower ear.

==The match==

A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials (referees) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).

===Modern format===
In modern Greco-Roman wrestling, matches are contested over two three-minute halves with the winner being decided by fall, technical superiority or cumulative points across both periods (decision). The modern format emphasizes wrestling on the feet instead of mat wrestling (par terre); in contrast to the older format, par terre now only occurs as a result of a takedown/throw or when a wrestler commits an infraction (eg: passivity).

Before each match, each wrestler&#x27;s name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the period. Upon conclusion of the match, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials&#x27; table. Both wrestlers then shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner&#x27;s hand. Each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and their opponent&#x27;s coach.

=== Old format ===
Prior to recent rule changes, a wrestler wins the match when he has won the majority of periods. For example, if one competitor were to win the first period 1–0 and the second period 1–0, the match would be over. However, if the other competitor were to win the second period, then a third and deciding period would result. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in period termination. One side effect of this format is that it is possible for the losing wrestler to outscore the winner. For example, periods may be scored 3–2, 0–4, 1–0, leading to a total score of 4–6 but a win for the wrestler scoring fewer points. This format was changed 

Each Greco-Roman period is broken up into a phase for wrestling from the neutral position and a maximum of two par terre (ground wrestling) phases. During the wrestling phase from the neutral position, both wrestlers compete for takedowns and points for 60 seconds as usual. At the end of the first minute, in general, the wrestler who has scored the most points will receive the advantage in an Olympic lift from an open par terre position on the other wrestler. This position is known as &quot;par terre&quot;. If neither wrestler at this point has any points, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a red-colored side and a blue-colored side. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss will receive the advantage in the Olympic lift.

The wrestler who lost the colored disk toss then places his hands and knees in the center circle, with the hands and knees at least 20 centimeters apart and the distance between the hands a maximum of 30 centimeters. The arms of that wrestler would be stretched out, the feet would not be crossed, and the thighs would be stretched out forming a 90-degree angle with the mat. The wrestler who won the colored disk toss would then be allowed to step beside the wrestler on the bottom, not touching him with his legs. If the wrestler who won the colored disk toss wished, he could place one knee on the mat. The top wrestler would then wrap his hands and arms around the bottom wrestler&#x27;s waist and execute the Olympic lift (called an upside-down belt hold) at the beginning of the first 30 seconds. The bottom wrestler could then attempt to defend himself.

At the end of first thirty seconds, the clinch position is reversed with the other wrestler receiving the Olympic lift, and the period continuing for the remaining 30 seconds. The period is decided by who accumulated the most points during both standing and ground phases. During each ground phase, if the top wrestler cannot score, the other wrestler is awarded one point. In the case of no scoring moves being executed during either ground phase the score will be 1–1, and in this case generally the wrestler to score last will be awarded the period.

===Scoring===

In Greco-Roman wrestling, as well as in freestyle wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:
* Takedown (2 to 5 points): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head).
** Five points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or &quot;par terre&quot; position into a direct and immediate danger position.
** Four points are generally awarded for a takedown brought about by a grand amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position.
** Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat.
* Reversal (1 point): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent).
* Exposure, also called the &quot;Danger Position&quot; (2 points): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent&#x27;s back to the mat for several seconds. Points for exposure are also awarded if a wrestler&#x27;s back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned. Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent&#x27;s shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is in an &quot;instantaneous fall&quot; position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler&#x27;s opponent rolls on his shoulders. A wrestler in the danger position allows his opponent to score two points. An additional &quot;hold-down point&quot; may be earned by maintaining the exposure continuously for five seconds.
* Penalty (1 or 2 points): Under the 2004–2005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding. Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, and using illegal holds) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a &quot;caution&quot;, and a choice of position to the opponent.
* Out of bounds (1 point): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent.

Classification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained. For example, a victory by fall would give the winner five classification points and the loser no points, while a match won by technical superiority with the loser scoring technical points would award three points to the winner and one point to loser.

The full determinations for scoring are found in the UWW International Wrestling Rules

==Victory conditions==

A match can be won in the following ways:
* Win by fall: The objective of the wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents&#x27; shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to &quot;observe the total control of the fall&quot; (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made; if the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall. A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs. In the United States, for the Kids freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling division (wrestlers ages 8 to 14) in competitions sponsored by USA Wrestling, it is specified that a fall must be held for two seconds.
* Win by technical superiority (also called &quot;technical fall&quot;): If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a period simply by points. If one wrestler gains an eight-point lead over his opponent at any break in continuous action, he is declared the winner of the match by technical superiority.
* Win by decision: If neither wrestler achieves either a fall or technical superiority, the wrestler who scored more points during the match is declared the winner. If the score is tied, the winner is determined by certain criteria. First, the number of cautions given to each wrestler for penalties; next, the value of points gained (that is, whether a wrestler gained points based on a two-, four-, or five-point move); and finally, the last scored technical point are taken into account to determine the winner. Generally, the wrestler who scored the last technical point will be awarded the period.
* Win by default: If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason, or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal as the case may be.
* Win by injury: If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a &quot;medical forfeit&quot; or &quot;injury default&quot;. The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. In the event a wrestler is injured by his opponent&#x27;s illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.
* Win by disqualification: If a wrestler is assessed three &quot;cautions&quot; for breaking the rules, he is disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality or gross disrespect for officials, the match will be ended immediately and the offending wrestler ejected from the tournament.

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60 kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team&#x27;s score is tallied, and the teams are then placed first, second, third, etc.

===Team competition===
A team competition or dual meet is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the &quot;home&quot; competition and one winning the &quot;away&quot; competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the least technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.

<text>Galatea (; ; &quot;she who is milk-white&quot;) is the post-antiquity name popularly applied to the statue carved of ivory alabaster by Pygmalion of Cyprus, which then came to life in Greek mythology.

Galatea is also the name of a sea-nymph, one of the fifty Nereids (daughters of Nereus) mentioned by Hesiod and Homer. In Theocritus &quot;Idylls VI&quot; and &quot;XI&quot; she is the object of desire of the one-eyed giant Polyphemus and is linked with Polyphemus again in the myth of Acis and Galatea in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. She is also mentioned in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; and &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

==Etymology==
Though the name &quot;Galatea&quot; has become so firmly associated with Pygmalion&#x27;s statue as to seem antique, its use in connection with Pygmalion originated with a post-classical writer. No extant ancient text mentions the statue&#x27;s name, although Pausanias mentions a statue of Calm, Galene (). As late as 1763, a sculpture of the subject shown by Falconet at the Paris Salon (&quot;see illustration&quot;) carried the title (&quot;Pygmalion at the feet of his statue that comes to life&quot;). That sculpture, currently at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, now bears the expected modern title &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot;.

According to Meyer Reinhold, the name &quot;Galatea&quot; was first given wide circulation in Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;scène lyrique&quot; of 1762, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. The name had become a commonplace of pastoral fictions, because of the well-known myth of Acis and Galatea; one of Honoré d&#x27;Urfé&#x27;s characters in &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot; was a Galatea, though not this sculptural creation.

==Myth==
The story of Pygmalion appeared earliest in a Hellenistic work, Philostephanus&#x27; history of Cyprus, &quot;De Cypro&quot;. It is retold in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, where the king Pygmalion is made into a sculptor who fell in love with a marble statue he had crafted with his own hands. In answer to his prayers, the goddess Aphrodite brought it to life and united the couple in marriage. This novella remained the classical telling until the end of the seventeenth century. The trope of the animated statue gained a vogue during the eighteenth century.

The &quot;daemon&quot; of Pygmalion&#x27;s goddess, animating her cult image, bore him a son Paphus—the eponym of the city of Paphos—and Metharme. Of &quot;this ecstatic relationship&quot;, Meyer Reinhold has remarked, &quot;there may be lurking a survival of the ancient cult of the Great Goddess and her consort&quot;.

Cinyras, perhaps the son of Paphus, or perhaps the successful suitor of Metharme, founded the city of Paphos on Cyprus, under the patronage of Aphrodite, and built the great temple to the goddess there.

&quot;Bibliotheke&quot;, the Hellenistic compendium of myth long attributed to Apollodorus, mentions a daughter of Pygmalion named Metharme. She was the wife of Cinyras, and the mother of Adonis, beloved of Aphrodite, although Myrrha, daughter of Cinyras, is more commonly named as the mother of Adonis.

It was commonly rumored in Roman times that Praxiteles&#x27;s cult image of Aphrodite of Knidos in Aphrodite&#x27;s temple was so beautiful that at least one admirer arranged to be shut in with it overnight.

==Interpretation==
The myth indicates that a cult image of Aphrodite was instrumental in some way in the founding myth of Paphos. It also seems axiomatic, apart from miraculous intervention, that the living representative of a cult image could be none but the chief priestess. Robert Graves gives a socio-political interpretation of the story, as a mythologized overthrow of a matrilineal cult. In his view Pygmalion, the consort of the goddess&#x27;s priestess at Paphos, kept the cult image of Aphrodite as a means of retaining power during his term, after which, Graves speculates, he refused to give up the goddess&#x27;s image &quot;and that he prolonged this by marriage with another of Aphrodite&#x27;s priestesses—technically his daughter, since she was heiress to the throne—who is called Metharme (&quot;change&quot;), to mark the innovation&quot;.

<text>Kiamba, officially the Municipality of Kiamba (; , Jawi: ايڠد نو كيامب; ), is a municipality in the province of Sarangani, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 65,774 people.

It is bordered on the west by Maitum, on the east by Maasim, on the north by South Cotabato, and on the south by the Celebes Sea.

Notable residents include Manny Pacquiao. It is the hometown of his wife Jinkee Pacquiao.

== History ==
The area of what is now known as MAKIMA was first inhabited by T&#x27;boli tribes people who mostly occupied the highlands. The lowlands and plains were mostly occupied by Maguindanaons especially Sultanate of Maguindanao then Sultanate of Buayan and the Sangil people who mostly are from Balut and Sangili islands, occupied the areas near the sea. The Ilocanos who are originally from Luzon only came to the area around 1920&#x27;s onwards as they heed the government&#x27;s homesteading and resettlement plan. Visayans later followed.

The municipality was formed on August 18, 1947, when Executive Order No. 82 was signed by the government by merging the municipal districts of Kraan and Kling.

Maitum on the west became an independent municipality in 1959. In 1971, Maasim, on the east, also became an independent municipality.

==Geography==

===Barangays===
Kiamba is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

===Climate===

==Demographics==
The majority of the population speak Cebuano, although early settlers were of Ilocano origin, as a result of assimilation into the majority Cebuano-speaking society due to the huge influx of migrants from Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, and other Cebuano-speaking parts of Mindanao residing in the area over the years. There are a lot of Moro people (Sangil and Maguindanaon) who settles in the area long before the Christians from Luzon (and later Visayas) came. One of the indigenous peoples living in mountainous areas of Kiamba is known as T&#x27;boli.
== Economy ==

The economy of Kiamba is largely based on agriculture with vast ricefields surrounding the municipality. Aqua-culture is the second biggest income earner, notably the culture of milkfish and shrimps (locally called &quot;sugpo&quot; or &quot;lukon&quot;) for export. Also, coastal communities depend on deep-sea fishing as a primary livelihood.

== Tourism ==
Various attractions include:
* The Timpuyog festival celebrates the town&#x27;s foundation anniversary. Timpuyog is an Ilocano word for unity, and the festival includes tribal shows and a carnival. Kiamba celebrates the Timpuyog Festival and Foundation Anniversary every February 14.
* Tuka Marine Park, a protected area where fishing is banned. It has four protected coves and only one (Tuka 2) is open to the public. The site has coral formations.
* Short, narrow roads lined with Japanese era houses
* Waterfalls in lush rainforests (ex. Nalus Falls)
* Beaches of Kiamba (ex. Wakap Beach in Datu Dani)
* Cockfights

== References in Media ==
Kiamba was the setting of the final, climactic segment of the action-adventure film Uncharted, being the supposed hiding spot of Magellan&#x27;s lost treasure.

<text>Poldasht () is a city in the Central District of Poldasht County in Iran&#x27;s West Azerbaijan province, serving as capital of both the county and the district. The city lies on the western bank of the Aras River. 

Poldasht is a Persian word meaning &quot;arable land by the bridge&quot;. The city is situated near the border crossing with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. Across the Poldasht-Shah Takhti Bridge over the Aras is the Azerbaijani village of Şahtaxtı. It is one of the two Iran-Nakhchivan border crossings; the other is located near the city of Jolfa in East Azerbaijan province. Also adjacent to Poldasht is the Aras River Dam.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 8,584 people in 2,205 households, when it was capital of the former Poldasht District of Maku County. The following census in 2011 counted 9,963 people in 2,658 households, by which time the district had been separated from the county in the establishment of Poldasht County. Poldasht was transferred to the new Central District as the county&#x27;s capital. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 11,472 people in 3,377 households.

<doc id="839842" wikidata="Q179440" url="?curid=839842" title="Anagenesis">
<text>Anagenesis is the gradual evolution of a species that continues to exist as an interbreeding population. This contrasts with cladogenesis, which occurs when there is branching or splitting, leading to two or more lineages and resulting in separate species. Anagenesis does not always lead to the formation of a new species from an ancestral species. When speciation does occur as different lineages branch off and cease to interbreed, a core group may continue to be defined as the original species. The evolution of this group, without extinction or species selection, is anagenesis.

== Hypotheses ==

One hypothesis is that during the speciation event in anagenetic evolution, the original populations will increase quickly, and then rack up genetic variation over long periods of time by mutation and recombination in a stable environment. Other factors such as selection or genetic drift will have such a significant effect on genetic material and physical traits that a species can be acknowledged as being different from the previous.

==Development==
An alternative definition offered for anagenesis involves progeny relationships between designated taxa with one or more denominated taxa in line with a branch from the evolutionary tree. Taxa must be within the species or genus and will help identify possible ancestors. When looking at evolutionary descent, there are two mechanisms at play. The first process is when genetic information changes. This means that over time there is enough of a difference in their genomes, and in the way that species&#x27; genes interact with each other during the developmental stage, that anagenesis can thereby be viewed as the processes of sexual and natural selection, and genetic drift&#x27;s effect on an evolving species over time. The second process, speciation, is closely associated with cladogenesis. Speciation includes the actual separation of lineages, into two or more new species, from one specified species of origin. Cladogenesis can be seen as a similar hypothesis to anagenesis, with the addition of speciation to its mechanisms. Diversity on a species-level is able to be achieved through anagenesis.

Anagenesis suggests that evolutionary changes can occur in a species over time to a sufficient degree that later organisms may be considered a different species, especially in the absence of fossils documenting the gradual transition from one to another. This is in contrast to cladogenesis—or speciation in a sense—in which a population is split into two or more reproductively isolated groups and these groups accumulate sufficient differences to become distinct species. The punctuated equilibria hypothesis suggests that anagenesis is rare and that the rate of evolution is most rapid immediately after a split which will lead to cladogenesis, but does not completely rule out anagenesis. Distinguishing between anagenesis and cladogenesis is particularly relevant in the fossil record, where limited fossil preservation in time and space makes it difficult to distinguish between anagenesis, cladogenesis where one species replaces the other, or simple migration patterns.

Recent evolutionary studies are looking at anagenesis and cladogenesis for possible answers in developing the hominin phylogenetic tree to understand morphological diversity and the origins of &quot;Australopithecus anamensis&quot;, and this case could possibly show anagenesis in the fossil record.

When enough mutations have occurred and become stable in a population so that it is significantly differentiated from an ancestral population, a new species name may be assigned. A series of such species is collectively known as an evolutionary lineage. The various species along an evolutionary lineage are chronospecies. If the ancestral population of a chronospecies does not go extinct, then this is cladogenesis, and the ancestral population represents a paraphyletic species or paraspecies, being an evolutionary grade.

== In humans ==

The modern human origins debate caused researchers to look further for answers. Researchers were curious to know if present day humans originated from Africa, or if they somehow, through anagenesis, were able to evolve from a single archaic species that lived in Afro-Eurasia. Milford H. Wolpoff is a paleoanthropologist whose work, studying human fossil records, explored anagenesis as a hypothesis for hominin evolution. When looking at anagenesis in hominids, M. H. Wolpoff describes in terms of the &#x27;single-species hypothesis,&#x27; which is characterized by thinking of the impact that culture has on a species, as an adaptive system, and as an explanation for the conditions humans tend to live in, based on the environmental conditions, or the ecological niche. When judging the effect that culture has as an Adaptive System, scientists must first look at modern Homo Sapiens. Wolpoff contended that the ecological niche of past, extinct hominidae is distinct within the line of origin. Examining early Pliocene and late Miocenes findings helps to determine the corresponding importance of Anagenesis vs. Cladogenesis during the period of morphological differences. These findings propose that branches of the human and chimpanzee once diverged from each other. The hominin fossils go as far as 5 to 7 million years ago (Mya). Diversity on a species-level is able to be achieved through anagenesis. With collected data, only one or two early hominin were found to be relatively close to the Plio-Pleistocene range. Once more research was done, specifically with the fossils of &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, researchers were able to justify that these two hominin species were linked ancestrally. However, looking at data collected by William H. Kimbel and other researchers, they viewed the history of early hominin fossils and concluded that actual macroevolution change via anagenesis was scarce.

== Phylogeny ==

DEM (or Dynamic Evolutionary Map) is a different way to track ancestors and relationships between organisms. The pattern of branching in phylogenetic trees and how far the branch grows after a species lineage has split and evolved, correlates with anagenesis and cladogenesis. However, in DEM dots depict the movement of these different species. Anagenesis is viewed by observing the dot movement across the DEM, whereas cladogenesis is viewed by observing the separation and movement of the dots across the map.

==Criticism==
Controversy arises among taxonomists as to when the differences are significant enough to warrant a new species classification: Anagenesis may also be referred to as gradual evolution. The distinction of speciation and lineage evolution as anagenesis or cladogenesis can be controversial, and some academics question the necessity of the terms altogether.

The philosopher of science Marc Ereshefsky argues that paraphyletic taxa are the result of anagenesis. The lineage leading to birds has diverged significantly from lizards and crocodiles, allowing evolutionary taxonomists to classify birds separately from lizards and crocodiles, which are grouped as reptiles.

==Applications==
Regarding social evolution, it has been suggested that social anagenesis/aromorphosis be viewed as universal or widely diffused social innovation that raises social systems&#x27; complexity, adaptability, integrity, and interconnectedness.

<text>Thingoe Rural District was a rural district in the county of West Suffolk, England between 1894 and 1974. It was named after the ancient Hundred of Thingoe (&quot;thing-hoe&quot; – &quot;assembly-mound&quot;) and administered from Bury St Edmunds, which it surrounded.

== History ==
Thingoe Rural District was formed under the Local Government Act 1894.

On 1 April 1935 the parish of Depden was transferred to the Clare Rural District. On the same date the district was enlarged by the transfer of the civil parishes of Barnham, Barningham, Coney Weston, Euston, Fakenham Magna, Hepworth, Honington, Hopton, Knettishall, Market Weston, Sapiston, and Thelnetham from the disbanded Brandon Rural District.

The district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Since 1 April 1974 it has formed part of the borough of St Edmundsbury and became part of West Suffolk district in 2019.

== Parishes ==
At the time of its dissolution it consisted of the following 58 parishes.

<text>Roderic (also spelled Ruderic, Roderik, Roderich, or Roderick; Spanish and , ; died 711) was the Visigothic king in Hispania between 710 and 711. He is well known as &quot;the last king of the Goths&quot;. He is actually an extremely obscure figure about whom little can be said with certainty. He was the last Goth to rule from Toledo, but not the last Gothic king, a distinction which belongs to Ardo.

Roderic&#x27;s election as king was disputed and he ruled only a part of Hispania with an opponent, Achila, ruling the rest. He faced a rebellion of the Basques and the Umayyad invasion. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Guadalete. His widow Egilona is believed to have married Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, the first Muslim governor of Hispania.

==Early life==
According to the late &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, Roderic was a son of Theodefred, himself a son of king Chindaswinth, and of a woman named Riccilo. Roderic&#x27;s exact date of birth is unknown but probably was after 687, estimated from his father&#x27;s marriage having taken place after his exile to Córdoba following the succession of King Egica in that year.

==Succession==

===Usurpation===
According to the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot;, Roderic &quot;tumultuously [&quot;tumultuose&quot;] invaded the kingdom [&quot;regnum&quot;] with the encouragement of [or at the exhortation of] the senate [&quot;senatus&quot;].&quot; Historians have long debated the exact meaning of these words. What is generally recognised is that it was not a typical palace coup as had occurred on previous occasions, but rather a violent invasion of the palace which sharply divided the kingdom.

It is probable that the &quot;invasion&quot; was not from outside the kingdom; because the word &quot;regnum&quot; can refer to the office of the king, it is likely that Roderic merely usurped the throne. Nonetheless, it is possible that Roderic was a regional commander (&quot;dux&quot; of Baetica in later, legendary sources) or even an exile when he staged his coup.

The &quot;tumult&quot; which surrounded this usurpation was probably violent, though whether or not it involved the deposition or assassination of the legitimate king, Wittiza, or was a consequence of his recent natural death has divided scholars. Some scholars believe that the king Achila, who ruled in opposition to Roderic, was in fact Wittiza&#x27;s son and successor and that Roderic had tried to usurp the throne from him.

The senate with which Roderic accomplished his coup was probably composed of the &quot;leading aristocrats and perhaps also some of the bishops.&quot; The participation of churchmen in the revolt is disputed, some arguing that the support of the bishops would not have led to the act being labelled a usurpation. The body of leading temporal and ecclesiastical lords had been the dominant body in determining the Visigothic succession since the reign of Reccared I. The palatine officials, however, had not been much affected by royal measures to decrease their influence in the final decades of the kingdom, as their effecting of a coup in 711 indicates.

===Division of the kingdom===
After the coup, the division of the kingdom into two factions, with the southwest (the provinces of Lusitania and western Carthaginiensis around the capital Toledo) in Roderic&#x27;s hands and the northeast (Tarraconensis and Narbonensis) in the hands of Achila is confirmed by archaeological and numismatic evidence. Roderic&#x27;s twelve surviving coins, all bearing the name Rvdericvs, were minted at Toledo, probably his capital, and &quot;Egitania&quot;, probably Idanha-a-Velha. The regions in which the coins have been discovered do not overlap and it seems highly probable that the two rulers ruled in opposition from different regions. It is unknown to whom the provinces of Gallaecia and Baetica fell. That Roderic and Achila never appear to have come into military conflict is probably best explained by the preoccupation of Roderic with Arab raids and not to a formal division of the kingdom.

A Visigothic regnal list mentions &quot;Ruderigus&quot; as having reigned seven years and six months, while two other continuations of the &quot;Chronicon Regum Visigothorum&quot; record Achila&#x27;s reign of three years. In contrast to the regnal lists, which cannot be dated, the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot;, written at Toledo, says that &quot;Rudericus&quot; reigned for a year.

==War with the Muslims==
According to the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot;, Roderic immediately upon securing his throne gathered a force to oppose the Arabs and Berbers (&quot;Mauri&quot;, whence the word &quot;Moors&quot;), who were raiding in the south of the Iberian peninsula and had destroyed many towns under Tariq ibn Ziyad and other Muslim generals. While later Arabic sources make the conquest of Hispania a singular event undertaken at the orders of the governor Musa ibn Nusair of Ifriqiya, according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which was written much nearer in date to the actual events, the Arabs began disorganised raids and undertook to conquer the peninsula only with the fortuitous death of Roderic and the collapse of the Visigothic nobility.

Paul the Deacon&#x27;s &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; records that the Saracens invaded &quot;all Hispania&quot; from Septem (Ceuta).

Roderic made several expeditions against the invaders before he was deserted by his troops and killed in battle in 711 or 712. The &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot; claims that some of the nobles who had accompanied Roderic on his last expedition did so out of &quot;ambition for the kingdom&quot;, perhaps intending to allow him to die in battle so that they could secure the throne for one of themselves. Whatever their intentions, most of them seem to have died in the battle as well.

Other historians have suggested that low morale amongst the soldiery because of Roderic&#x27;s disputed succession was the cause of defeat. The majority of Roderic&#x27;s soldiers may have been poorly trained and unwilling slave conscripts; there were probably few freemen left fighting for the Goths.

The location of the battle is debatable. It probably occurred near the mouth of the Guadalete river, hence its name, the Battle of Guadalete. According to Paul the Deacon, the site was the otherwise unidentifiable &quot;Transductine promontories&quot;.

According to the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot;, the Arabs took Toledo in 711 and executed many nobles still in the city on the pretense that they had assisted in the flight of Oppa, a son of Egica. Since it took place, according to the same chronicle, after Roderic&#x27;s defeat, either the defeat must be moved back to 711 or the conquest of Toledo pushed back to 712; the latter is preferred by Collins. It is possible that the Oppa who fled Toledo and was a son of a previous king was the cause of the &quot;internal fury&quot; which wracked Hispania at the time recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Perhaps Oppa had been declared king at Toledo by Roderic and Achila&#x27;s rivals, either before Roderic&#x27;s final defeat or between his death and the Arab capture of Toledo. If so, the death of the nobles who had &quot;ambition for the kingdom&quot; may have been Oppa&#x27;s supporters who were killed in Toledo by the Arabs shortly after the battle in the south.

According to a 9th-century chronicle, a tombstone with the inscription &quot;Hic requiescit Rodericus, rex Gothorum&quot; (here rests Roderic, king of the Goths) was found at Egitania (modern Idanha-a-Velha, Portugal). According to the legend of Nazaré the king fled the battlefield alone. Roderic left a widow, Egilo, who later married one of the Arabic governors of Hispania, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa.

==In legend and literature==

According to a legend that was for centuries treated as historical fact, Roderic seduced or raped the daughter of Count Julian, known in late accounts as Florinda la Cava. The tale of romance and treachery has inspired many works.

According to the &quot;Legend of Nazaré&quot;, Roderic acquired the stature of Our Lady of Nazaré during the Battle of Guadalete.

Roderic life is alluded in Nights 272 and 273 of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. In the story, a king opens a mysterious door in his castle that was locked and sealed shut by the previous kings. The king discovers paintings of Muslim soldiers in the room and a note saying that the city of Labtayt will fall to the soldiers in the paintings if the room is ever opened. The king is later killed by Tariq ibn Ziyad. The details coincide with the fall of Toledo.

Roderic is a central figure in the English playwright William Rowley&#x27;s tragedy &quot;All&#x27;s Lost by Lust&quot;, which portrays him as a rapist usurped by Count Julian and the Moors.

The Scottish writer Walter Scott and the English writers Walter Savage Landor and Robert Southey handled the legends associated with those events poetically: Scott in &quot;The Vision of Don Roderick&quot; in 1811; Landor in his tragedy &quot;Count Julian&quot; in 1812; and Southey in &quot;Roderick the Last of the Goths&quot;, in 1814.

The American writer Washington Irving retold the legends in his &quot;Legends of the Conquest of Spain&quot; (1835), mostly written while living in that country. These consist of &quot;Legend of Don Roderick&quot;, &quot;Legend of the Subjugation of Spain&quot;, and &quot;Legend of Count Julian and His Family&quot;.

Roderic has been mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s short story &quot;Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent&quot; by the name of &quot;Don Rodrigo, the Goth&quot; as a sinner that shares a common vice with &quot;a man of impure life, and a brazen face&quot;.

In Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s unfinished poem Rodrik (Russian Родрик) Roderic survives the last battle, becomes a hermit and gets a promise of victory from Heaven.

Roderic has been the subject of two operas: &quot;Rodrigo&quot; by George Frideric Handel and &quot;Don Rodrigo&quot; by Alberto Ginastera.

Roderic appears as a minor character in the first half of Portuguese early Romantic writer Alexandre Herculano&#x27;s novel &quot;Eurico, o Presbítero&quot; (&quot;Euric, the Presbyter&quot;, 1844).

Roderic&#x27;s story is told the British West End musical &quot;La Cava&quot; (2000).

<text>Salamaua () was a small town situated on the northeastern coastline of Papua New Guinea, in Salamaua Rural LLG, Morobe province. The settlement was built on a minor isthmus between the coast with mountains on the inland side and a headland. The closest city is Lae, which can be reached only via boat across the gulf.

==History==
In the 1920s prospective gold miners used Salamaua as a staging post to explore for gold in the inland areas. Gold was discovered at Wau and miners came from all over and made for the goldfields via the rough Black Cat Track.

The town was captured by the Japanese on 8 March 1942 during World War II and later retaken by Australian and United States forces led by General Douglas MacArthur on 11 September 1943 during the Salamaua–Lae campaign. During reoccupation the town was destroyed.

Today the villages of Kela and Lagui occupy the site, as well as holiday houses that are mainly owned by expatriates based in Lae.

<text>Hugh Colin Hopper (29 April 1945 – 7 June 2009) was a British progressive rock and jazz fusion bass guitarist. He was a prominent member of the Canterbury scene, as a member of Soft Machine and other bands.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Starting in 1963 as bassist with The Daevid Allen Trio, alongside drummer Robert Wyatt, he alternated between free jazz and rhythm and blues. In 1964 with Brian Hopper (his brother), Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers and Richard Sinclair he formed The Wilde Flowers, a pop music group. Although they never released any records during their existence (a compilation was released 30 years later), The Wilde Flowers are acknowledged as the founders of the Canterbury scene and spawned its two most important groups, Soft Machine and Caravan.

===With Soft Machine (1968–1973)===
Hopper&#x27;s role with Soft Machine was initially as the group&#x27;s road manager, but he already composed for their first album &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; and played bass on one of its tracks. In 1969 he was recruited to be the group&#x27;s bassist for their second album, &quot;Volume Two&quot; and, with Mike Ratledge and Robert Wyatt, he took part in a recording session for a solo album of Syd Barrett&#x27;s (formerly of Pink Floyd, with whom the early Soft Machine had regularly gigged). Hopper continued with Soft Machine, playing bass and contributing numerous compositions until 1973. During his tenure the group evolved from a psychedelic rock group to an instrumental jazz-rock fusion band. In 1972, shortly before leaving Soft Machine, he recorded the first record under his own name, &quot;1984&quot; (named after George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;). This was a decidedly non-commercial record featuring lengthy solo pieces using tape loops as well as shorter pieces with a group. Hopper later reminisced about the record, &quot;I don&#x27;t think a lot of it was very successful, but I remember sitting for about three or four hours at Advision trying to record the sound of a mosquito so that I could use that as a bit of a loop.&quot;
===1973 until 2009===
After leaving Soft Machine, through the end of the 1970s, he worked with such groups as Stomu Yamashta&#x27;s East Wind, Isotope, Gilgamesh, and the Carla Bley Band. He also played in a couple of cooperative bands alongside former Soft Machine saxophonist Elton Dean: Hopper/Dean/Tippett/Gallivan (with pianist Keith Tippett and drummer Joe Gallivan) and Soft Heap (with keyboard-player Alan Gowen and drummer Pip Pyle).

In the early 1980s Hopper gave up playing music for a couple of years, but by the mid-1980s he was actively working with several bands, including Pip Pyle&#x27;s Equipe Out and Phil Miller&#x27;s In Cahoots. He also began playing with a group of Dutch musicians in a band initially called Hopper Goes Dutch. After French guitarist Patrice Meyer joined, this group became known as the Hugh Hopper Franglo-Dutch Band.

After many years working primarily in instrumental, jazz-oriented groups including Short Wave, in the mid-1990s Hopper began occasionally working again in more rock-oriented vocal contexts, including several collaborations with the band Caveman Shoestore (using the name Hughscore) and with singer Lisa S. Klossner. He also returned to his early tape loop experiments, but now using computer technology, in recordings such as &quot;Jazzloops&quot; (2002).

In the 1990s and 2000s several projects led Hopper to revisit his Soft Machine past. In 1998 he was asked to participate in a project by the French jazz collective Polysons, joining them in performances of Softs classics which featured Polysons members (Pierre-Olivier Govin and Jean-Rémy Guédon on saxes, Serge Adam on trumpet and François Merville on drums) plus organist Emmanuel Bex. The resulting Polysoft group was re-activated in 2002–03 to perform at Parisian club Le Triton, with fellow ex-Softs Elton Dean sitting in, resulting in a live CD, &quot;Tribute To Soft Machine&quot;, released on the club&#x27;s own label.

Also in 2002–04, Hopper, Dean and two other former Soft Machine members (drummer John Marshall, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth) toured and recorded under the name SoftWorks. With another former Soft Machine member, guitarist John Etheridge, replacing Holdsworth, they toured and recorded as Soft Machine Legacy, playing some pieces from the original Soft Machine repertoire as well as new works. Three albums of theirs were released: &quot;Live in Zaandam&quot; (CD, rec. 2005/05/10), &quot;New Morning – The Paris Concert&quot; (DVD, rec. 2005/12/12) and the studio album &quot;Soft Machine Legacy&quot; (CD, 2006, rec. 09/2005). After Elton Dean died in February 2006, Theo Travis replaced him, and Soft Machine Legacy recorded the album &quot;Steam&quot;, released in 2007.

Other occasional projects were Soft Bounds (with French musicians Sophia Domancich and Simon Goubert, first with Elton Dean and then Simon Picard), which like PolySoft released a live CD recorded at the Triton club, and Clear Frame, an improvising group with Charles Hayward, Lol Coxhill and Orphy Robinson (augmented for their first release by Robert Wyatt on cornet). Hopper also appeared on the 2004 debut solo album by No-Man singer Tim Bowness (My Hotel Year, on One Little Indian Records.

Hopper recorded two solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the highly regarded UK-based internet label, Burning Shed. He worked with Japanese musician and composer Yumi Hara Cawkwell as a duo called HUMI. They had a tour of Japan planned for early 2008, which did not happen due to Hopper&#x27;s health.

Hopper was diagnosed with leukaemia in June 2008 and underwent chemotherapy. As a result of his illness and the treatment, he cancelled all his concert appearances. A Hugh Hopper benefit concert took place in December 2008 at the 100 Club in London and featured In Cahoots, members of Soft Machine Legacy, Delta Sax Quartet, Sophia Domancich and Simon Goubert, Yumi Hara Cawkwell, and the Alex Maguire Sextet. Another benefit was planned for late June 2009. He married his partner Christine on 5 June 2009 and died of leukaemia on 7 June. His funeral, a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony to respect Hugh&#x27;s wishes, was held on 25 June 2009.

A series of ten CDs of unreleased live and studio recordings began release in 2014 by Gonzo MultiMedia to benefit Hugh&#x27;s family.

<text>The Chicago Tunnel Company was the builder and operator of a narrow-gauge railway freight tunnel network under downtown Chicago, Illinois. This was regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission as an interurban even though it operated entirely under central Chicago, did not carry passengers, and was entirely underground. It inspired the construction of the London Post Office Railway.

==History==

=== Initial tunnels ===
The city of Chicago granted the newly formed Illinois Telephone and Telegraph company the rights to construct utility tunnels under the streets of Chicago in 1899 to carry its planned network of telephone cables. Initial plans for the tunnels called for filling them with phone cables, leaving a by passage for maintenance. When the city refused to permit manholes through which cable could be unreeled into the tunnels, the plans were changed to include rails for hauling cable spools through the tunnels. The city was largely unaware of the nature of the tunneling, and the first of tunnel were excavated somewhat covertly, working from the basement of a saloon and carting away the spoil after midnight.

Initially, the intended purpose of the narrow gauge railroad below the telephone cables was limited to hauling out excavation debris and hauling cable spools during the installation of telephone lines, but in 1903, the company renegotiated its franchise to allow the use of this railroad for freight and mail service. In early 1905, the system was taken over by the Illinois Tunnel Company. By this time, of a projected of tunnel had been completed. The actual construction work was subcontracted to the Illinois Telephone Construction Company, under the management of George W. Jackson (1861–1922).

===Refinancing===
By 1904, the first round of financing for tunnel system construction had largely been spent. A second round of financing was arranged by James Stillman of the National City Bank of New York City, with public support from E. H. Harriman, Jacob H. Schiff, and Patrick A. Valentine, all directors of that bank. With this financing, the Chicago Subway Company, incorporated in New Jersey, became a new holding company for the tunnel system.

The Chicago Warehouse and Terminal Company was an affiliate, formed in 1904 to construct and operate terminal facilities for interchanging freight with railroads and other carriers.

The Illinois Tunnel Company continued to expand the tunnel system and serve a growing customer base until 1908, when the employees moved to join the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees. The tunnel company refused to recognize the union and began firing union members. Despite the intervention of Congressman William Lorimer, all 260 employees went on strike on May 9. The company hired strikebreakers and refused to rehire any of the strikers.

The Tunnel Company ran into a problem with a part of its planned expansion. In November 1906, the Chicago Board of Local Improvements announced it was considering widening Halsted Street between Chicago Avenue and 22nd Street. 300 property owners on Halsted Street, represented by the Law Firm of Adler &amp; Lederer (now known as Arnstein &amp; Lehr, LLP), opposed the widening of the street because it would interfere with their business and the cost would result in burdensome assessments. Attorney Charles Lederer charged that there was graft connected with the proposition to widen the street and that if this was done the scheme was then to utilize the street to connect the tunnel with the Chicago Stockyards so that it would have access to the railroads.

===Bankruptcy and reorganization===

By 1909, the cost of construction had bankrupted the Illinois Tunnel Company. By this time, it was estimated that $30,000,000 had been spent on building and operating the tunnel. The receiver&#x27;s sale was completed in 1912, with the Chicago Tunnel Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago Utilities Company, acquiring all assets of the former company and its affiliates, the Chicago Warehouse and Terminal Company and the Illinois Telephone and Telegraph Company. In 1913, the Chicago Tunnel Company agreed to sell its telephone operations to American Telephone and Telegraph Company, although regulatory approval delayed the actual sale until 1916. By 1920, all telephone cables had been removed from the tunnels.

By 1914, about of tunnel had been constructed, typically high and wide, with gauge track. 19 elevators connected the tunnel with customers, and five elevators served universal public stations where freight could be dropped off or picked up by the public. The railroad operated 132 electric locomotives, typically each, and had 2,042 merchandise cars, 350 excavating cars and 235 coal and ash cars. In 1914, the tunnel company handled of freight, of which were merchandise. The remainder was presumably coal, ash and excavation debris.

From 1912 into the 1930s, the tunnel company was managed by Sherman Weld Tracy. It was never very profitable, but it avoided receivership, with most of the stock held by J. Ogden Armour, E. H. Harriman and their heirs.

===Conflict with the subway===
Plans for passenger subway service in Chicago date back to the turn of the 20th century, and the original permits to dig the freight tunnels allowed for future cut-and-cover subway development above the tunnels. In the 1930s, when the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the city finalized the design of the State Street and Dearborn Street subways, plans called for the tunnels to be dug through the blue clay along the line originally followed by the freight tunnels. Excavation debris from the new subway tunnels was hauled away by the Chicago Tunnel Company as the subway replaced the freight tunnels along their route.

===Company failure ===
The Chicago Tunnel Company went bankrupt and applied for voluntary reorganization in 1956. The tunnel company attempted to sever itself from the bankrupt holding company, claiming it could operate at a profit, but by 1959, the tunnel asked for abandonment permission. The Interstate Commerce Commission consented to abandonment that July, and the tunnel assets were sold at auction for $64,000 in October.

=== Tunnel flooding ===

In late 1991 near the Kinzie Street Bridge, a new set of pilings (collectively known as a &quot;dolphin&quot;) were driven into the riverbed to prevent barges from bumping into the bridge. As the pillars were installed, a miscalculation was made that caused severe damage to the tunnel directly below the river.

The risk of flooding was well understood by George W. Jackson, the chief engineer who built the tunnel system. In 1909, Jackson received a patent on a portable bulkhead that could be used to seal off flooded tunnel sections. The tunnel developers were also concerned by the flooding risk posed by firefighting efforts in buildings connected to the tunnels. Should a building catch fire, immense quantities of water could pour into the tunnels through elevator shafts and basement connections. To deal with this risk, watertight fire doors were fitted into all building connections. Small leaks in the tunnels under the Chicago River had become commonplace by 1913; to deal with them, the tunnel company drilled holes in the tunnel wall and pumped grout at high pressure into the soil outside the tunnel in the vicinity of the leak.

The 1992 flood was not the first time that a contractor&#x27;s action threatened to flood Chicago by puncturing the tunnel. In 1959, an excavation punctured the tunnel, leading to a dramatic and successful fight to prevent disaster.

In 1992, a cable television employee in the tunnel underneath the Chicago River videotaped mud and water oozing in where the bottom of the wooden pilings had cracked the tunnel wall. The pilings making up the dolphin had been driven only a few feet from the side of the tunnel, and the wooden pilings were visible through the collapsed tunnel wall where wet clay had slumped away from the wood into the tunnel.

Official response to the reported leak was slow; no emergency measures were deemed necessary, and a formal bidding process began for the contract to repair the damage. On April 13, some six months later, the slow oozing of wet clay opened a clear passage from the riverbed, allowing the river to pour directly into the tunnel. In what became known as the Chicago Flood, the entire system was quickly flooded. The Merchandise Mart was the first victim, declaring a water emergency at 5:57 am. City Hall began to flood by 6:02 am, the Federal Reserve Bank at 8:29 am, finally, the Chicago Hilton and Towers at 12:08 pm. The long delay before some buildings were flooded was the result of closure of some sections of the tunnel system in 1942 when the passenger subways were built. Many businesses had not realized that they were still connected to the tunnel complex, as the openings were boarded up, bricked up, or otherwise closed off—but not made watertight.

At that point, government agencies belatedly responded. The leak was stopped and the tunnels were emptied within days at great cost. The tunnels are still used for power and communication cables. They have been popular with urban exploration groups who would sometimes sneak in to have a look around, but since the Joseph Konopka terrorism scare in the early 2000s, all access to the tunnels has been secured.

The accident shut down the entire downtown area for days, causing considerable economic losses. Insurance battles lasted for years, the central point being the definition of the accident, &quot;i.e.,&quot; whether it was a &quot;flood&quot; or a &quot;leak.&quot; Leaks were covered by insurance, while floods were not. Eventually it was classified a leak, which is why some have called it the &quot;Great Chicago Leak.&quot;

=== Recent incidents ===

On October 14, 2009, workers pumping concrete into the tunnel under the Kennedy Expressway caused the roadway to buckle, shutting down all but one lane of the westbound expressway.

==Design and construction==

The standard tunnel was egg-shaped, high and wide, with tunnel walls thick and a floor thick. Some trunk-line tunnel segments were built larger, high by wide. The tunnels were built through a layer of soft blue clay, and tunneling was done by cutting the clay with modified draw knives. Parts of the tunnel were pressurized to during tunneling, while other parts were tunneled at atmospheric pressure. The tunnel was lined with coarse concrete and then waterproofed with a Portland-cement limestone-dust plaster. George W. Jackson was granted a patent on the system of forms used in making the concrete tunnel lining.

The city asked that the tunnel be built no shallower than below the pavement in order to allow room for a future streetcar subway.

During construction, temporary gauge tracks were laid. The tunnel was wide enough for double tracks with this small size. The tunnel company had 900 small cars built specifically to run on this track. The cars had a box with a capacity of only , and were pulled by mules from the tunnel headings to hoists that removed the spoil to the surface or later to points where the spoil could be transferred to gauge cars for haulage to the Grant Park disposal station. Tunneling work continued around the clock, 24 hours a day, completing an average of of tunnel per year per heading during the first few years of development
The gauge track was laid in the tunnels, using rails high (). Crossties were not used. Instead, rails were mounted on chairs embedded in the concrete tunnel floor. Frogs and crossings were built on steel plates that were then embedded in the concrete floor.

Curves in the tunnels were very tight. Mainline curves were as little as radius, and the grand unions under street intersections were built to a radius. Grades in the tunnel system were limited to 1.75 percent, except for the lines up to the Grant Park disposal station, which climbed at a 12 percent grade.

The tunnel, below street level, was drained by 71 electric pumps. There was very little seepage into the tunnels, a natural consequence of excavation in clay, but any water that did find its way in was quickly pumped up to the sewers above. Ventilation was natural, relying primarily on the piston effect of trains pushing through the tunnels to circulate the air.

While buildings with deep subbasements could connect directly to the tunnel, connections to surface level and shallow basements were by elevator shafts. George W. Jackson, the contractor who built the tunnel system, received several patents related to building such shafts.

==Equipment==

===Motive power===
The first test trains were run a few years after the start of construction. Most of the tunnel system was operated using overhead lines and trolley poles for power. Between 1903 and 1904, the Illinois Telephone Construction Company purchased 22 class L. M. locomotives from General Electric. These weighed and had two traction motors. Most of the engines used in the tunnels were standard mine haulage locomotives made by the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company. These weighed and had two traction motors each. Commonwealth Edison provided the electric power at 250 volts.
On the grades leading up from the tunnel to the Grant Park disposal station, the Morgan system sold by the Goodman Equipment Mfg. Co. was used. Morgan locomotives used a central third rail for power and also as a rack for traction. This system was also widely sold to the mining industry and was particularly valuable where mines had steep grades. Temporary Morgan third-rail was installed in the tunnels during installation of the telephone cables on the tunnel ceiling, but after construction was completed, the Morgan system was only used in the context of the grade to the Grant Park disposal station and its use ceased with the closure of that disposal station.

Between 1906 and 1908, the tunnel company purchased a number of Baldwin engines. One of these, number 508, was recovered from the tunnel leading to the Field Museum in 1996, when the rebuilding of the Outer Drive past the museum uncovered the old Grant Park Disposal Station elevator shaft. While not functional, this engine and cars is now on display in the collection of the Illinois Railway Museum.

By 1914, the tunnel company was operating two gasoline powered locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works on the surface trackage in Grant Park. These engines weighed and were long, wide and high. The 4-cylinder engines were coupled to the driving wheels through a jackshaft and side rods. These machines had a two-speed transmission with a top speed of .

===Freight cars===

The standard freight cars on the tunnel were long and wide, running on two 4-wheel trucks and designed to operate on curves with a radius. Cars were equipped with National Steel Castings Co. &quot;Sharon&quot; 1/2 size MCB Couplers, and were of all steel and iron construction.

The tunnel bought hundreds of Bettendorf flat cars that could be converted to gondolas and had a capacity of or . Bettendorf&#x27;s patents include several pertaining to cars that match this description.

Ash and excavation debris removal cars were equipped with the Newman patent dump box with a capacity. Newman, who was in charge of excavation spoil removal during the early phase of construction, developed this dump box because the clay removed during tunnel excavation was so sticky that it was difficult to dump from conventional side-dump cars.

Additional cars were built by Kilbourne &amp; Jacobs. These were simple metal flat cars wide by long with closely spaced stake pockets to restrain the cargo.

==Operation==
Revenue service in the tunnels officially began on August 15, 1906, with a 16-minute run. By that time, of track were in place, with connections to four railroads and 40 on-line customers. A total of 67 locomotives and 400 freight cars were on hand. In fact, coal delivery by subway began on October 13, 1905, when several carloads of coal were delivered from the Chicago and Alton Railroad coal chutes.

In 1915, most tunnel operation occurred between 7 am and 5 pm, with limited night operation primarily serving excavation spoil removal and coal and ash service. In a typical 10-hour work day, there were 500 to 600 train movements, all conducted under the authority of a telephone-based dispatching system. Dial telephones were installed at every street intersection so that engineers could easily remain in contact with the dispatcher. In 1914, the tunnel employed 568 people, including 116 motormen, 57 elevator men, 59 truckers, 74 clerks and three dispatchers. A 1916 survey showed that the tunnel carried 18 percent of the freight traffic in the Chicago loop.

In 1929, it was estimated that the tunnels handled between 200 and 300 train movements a day, with 10 to 15 cars per train. At the time, the tunnel had 150 locomotives, 2,693 merchandise cars, 151 coal cars and 400 excavation and ash cars.

In 1954, the tunnel was carrying 500 carloads of freight and 400 carloads of cinders and debris daily. There were 83 locomotives, 1,609 freight cars, 55 trucks and 272 semi trailers on hand. Surface trucking was an important part of the business, required to reach customers located outside the loop. The workforce had declined considerably from the tunnel&#x27;s heyday, with just 30 motormen operating the trains. The tunnel workforce was so dominated by attrition that someone with 25 years of experience in the tunnel was viewed as a newcomer.

===Merchandise===
In 1914, the tunnel had direct connections for freight interchange (by elevator) with 26 railroads and two boat lines. In addition, there were four public tunnel stations where shippers could drop or pick up merchandise, and 36 industries had direct tunnel connections, including Chicago&#x27;s big department stores, Marshall Field&#x27;s, Carson Pirie Scott and Rothchild&#x27;s. In 1913, the tunnel carried 544,071 carloads or of merchandise. Of this, 231,585 carloads were sent from public stations, 177,743 carloads from industrial customers served by the tunnel, and 134,743 carloads from railroad freight terminals.

===Mail===

The Illinois Tunnel Company built connections to post offices and passenger stations specifically for mail service. Tunnel mail service began in September 1906 at a contracted rate of $172,600 per year. Within six months, it became apparent that the Tunnel Company was having difficulty with timely delivery, and the post office threatened to abrogate its contract. Mail service through the tunnels was terminated at the end of the two-year contract.

In 1953, the tunnel company again explored getting into the mail business. Aside from brief experiments, this went nowhere.

===Coal===

In 1914, 22 buildings had tunnel connections for coal delivery, including the First National Bank of Chicago, several hotels, Marshall Field&#x27;s, City Hall and the County Building. A total of 16,414 carloads or of coal were handled in 1913.

The tunnel had two coal receiving stations in 1915 for loading coal onto tunnel trains. One was served by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, the other by the Chicago and Alton Railroad. Surface railroad cars dumped coal into bins under the track, from which chutes led down to the tunnel. A tunnel car could be loaded with a full load of of coal in two seconds.

Coal was carried in side-dump cars, from which it was dumped into a hopper below each customer&#x27;s boiler room. A conveyor then carried the coal up from the trackside hopper to the customer&#x27;s boiler room. The details of the latter connection depended on the depth of the building&#x27;s basement. Chicago&#x27;s new City building on the corner of Washington and LaSalle had a subbasement below sidewalk level, so the tunnel connection was made by a trench. The Commercial National Bank&#x27;s coal bins were under the sidewalk on Clark Street. There, coal was lifted from the tunnel by a vertical bucket conveyor running in a small shaft.

Before the 1940s the tunnels were used to deliver coal to downtown buildings, and to remove ash or clinkers. Trucks began to siphon off significant amounts of business, however, and by the late 1940s, customers began to switch from coal to natural gas to heat their buildings. The ones that kept burning coal switched to delivery by truck because unloading from the surface was easier, and a complex conveyor system was not required.

===Excavation debris and ashes===
Early operation in the tunnels was dominated by removal of excavation debris from the tunnel itself, and once tunnel service reached various areas, several construction contractors found that it was less expensive to dump excavation debris down into tunnel trains than it was to haul it out through the congested streets of the Chicago Loop. As a result, excavation debris continued to make up a significant part of tunnel traffic after the tunnel system was completed. Ash from coal-fired furnaces was freely mixed with this stream of debris.

In the early days of tunneling, excavation debris was hauled to the surface through small construction shafts and then to the lakefront by horse and wagon. By 1903, some excavation debris was being dumped onto scows for disposal in the lake. In 1904, tunnels sloping up at a 9 percent grade to the Grant Park disposal station were opened, and the vast majority of excavation debris and ash was hauled out to fill Grant Park. A derrick with a boom picked the dump boxes off the cars and swung them out over the lake to dump the fill.

The new Cook County Courthouse was among the construction sites that disposed of excavation debris through the tunnel system. Before the digging of the freight tunnels, shallow spread foundations were common using iron grillage to spread the heavy weight where tall buildings were involved. Deep foundations became almost universal with the construction of the tunnel system because the tunnel threatened to undermine shallow foundations, access to the tunnel made it practical to remove large volumes of excavation spoil, and deep basements permitted easy access to the tunnel for coal delivery and ash removal.

In 1908, further dumping of refuse on the lake front was prohibited, and the Tunnel Company responded by building a new disposal station on the Chicago River. Here, elevators lifted tunnel cars to the surface where they were dumped into self-propelled catamaran &quot;dump scows&quot; with a capacity of . The scows then took the debris out into the lake for dumping in deep water. George W. Jackson, the Tunnel&#x27;s chief engineer, filed a patent on a scow fitting this description.

Filling on the lakefront began again in 1913, with the construction of a tunnel extension to a new disposal station on the lake shore beyond what was then the south end of Grant Park. Here, twin elevators lifted the cars to the surface. Fill from this disposal station created the land under the Field Museum of Natural History and the Century of Progress Exposition (Now the site of Soldier Field and McCormick Place).

In 1913, the tunnel system handled 51,685 carloads of excavation debris and 14,605 carloads of cinders and other refuse. Excavation debris and ash were billed per carload, so the tonnage is not available. A 1929 estimate put the average combined excavation and ash traffic at 75,000 carloads per year. Immense amounts of fill were hauled by tunnel to the lake during construction of Chicago&#x27;s new main post office adjacent to Union Station in the early 1920s.

Even though coal deliveries were made with trucks, it was still more efficient to remove ashes by tunnel. This basically left the company in the ash removal business for the last ten years of operation.

===Secondary businesses===
The tunnel company had a curious secondary business, namely air conditioning, which was accomplished by selling naturally cool tunnel air to theaters above the tunnels. The McVickers, Rialto and four other theaters owned by the same company used tunnel air. Tunnel air was also utilized in the winter, as heating this air required less energy than heating the often much colder outside air. They estimated that they used less than one-third the coal they would have used without the tunnel connection. The tunnel air was a constant year round.

In 1933, the tunnel company sought financing from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to diversify into district heating, using the tunnels to carry steam pipes from a central steam plant to various customers. At the time, an estimated ten percent of Chicago&#x27;s loop businesses already used district heating services provided by the Illinois Maintenance Company, formerly part of Insull Utilities Investment Inc.

<doc id="839874" wikidata="Q1942945" url="?curid=839874" title="Texas leafcutter ant">
<text>The Texas leafcutter ant (Atta texana) is a species of fungus-farming ant in the subfamily Myrmicinae. It is found in Texas, Louisiana, and north-eastern Mexico. Other common names include town ant, parasol ant, fungus ant, cut ant, and night ant. It harvests leaves from over 200 plant species, and is considered a major pest of agricultural and ornamental plants, as it can defoliate a citrus tree in less than 24 hours. Every colony has several queens and up to 2 million workers. Nests are built in well-drained, sandy or loamy soil, and may reach a depth of , have 1000 entrance holes, and occupy .

==Description==
Workers measure in length, and are highly polymorphic. The back of the thorax has three pairs of spines. The ant has a narrow waist and is rusty brown in color. It should also be mentioned: Its closely related cousin, &quot;Atta mexicana&quot; has colonies up to 8 Million, and the queen for &quot;A. mexicana&quot; is larger than the &quot;texana&quot; queen; however, it should also be mentioned that &quot;A. mexicana&quot; is only able to have a single queen, while &quot;A. texana&quot; may have multiple queens (Often 2). This makes the species polygyne and because of this trait, &quot;A. texana&quot; can form massive super colonies with upwards of 10,000,000 total ants in the colony.
Because of the massive super colonies that they can form, they have been known to cause issues in the local environment and have been a troubling pest for humans living nearby these super colonies.

Life Cycle

The queen ant will deposit eggs that then hatch into cream colored larvae. Fully developed 1/4 to ½ inch long larvae form pupae. In the spring, some larvae develop into larger (3/4 inch long) winged male and female ants, called reproductives. Males have much smaller heads than do females and both have long smoky black wings. 

== Behavior ==
The nuptial flights of &quot;A. texana&quot; synchronize in regions; the virgin queens and males fly at night. Their foraging type is Mass Recruitment (MR). The Mass Recruitment foraging type consists of many ants all going out into one big group and searching for food.

<text> () is the best-known collection of sermons, letters, and sayings attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib (), the fourth Rashidun caliph (), the first Shia imam, and the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The compilation of the book is often credited to Sharif al-Radi (), a prominent Shia scholar. Known for its moral aphorisms and eloquent content, is widely studied in the Islamic world and has considerably influenced the Arabic literature and rhetoric. In view of its sometimes sensitive content, the authenticity of the book has long been a subject of polemic debates, though recent academic research suggests that most of its contents can indeed be attributed to Ali by tracking the texts in sources that predate al-Radi.

== Overview ==
 is an eleventh-century collection of more than two-hundred sermons, nearly eighty letters, and almost five-hundred sayings, all attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was the fourth Rashidun caliph () and the first Shia imam. The sermons and letters in offer a commentary on the political career of Ali, and have served as an ideological basis for Islamic governance. In particular, the letter of instructions therein addressed to Malik al-Ashtar (), a commander of Ali, has received much attention as a model for just and righteous Islamic governance. The book includes detailed discussions about social responsibilities, emphasizing that greater responsibilities result in greater rights.

 contains sensitive material, such as sharp criticism of the predecessors of Ali, and disapproval of the triumvirate who revolted against Ali in the Battle of the Camel in 656, namely, Talha and Zubayr, who were both senior companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and his widow Aisha. The book remains relevant to the ongoing clerical debates about the role and status of women in Islamic societies. contains passages about morality and doctrine, notably about the sovereignty of God and the essence of the Quran and the prophethood. Among them, the letter of life advices addressed to Hasan, the eldest son of Ali, has received considerable attention.

Recognized as an example of the most eloquent Arabic, is said to have significantly influenced the Arabic literature and rhetoric. The book has been the focus of numerous commentaries, translations, and studies by both Sunni and Shia authors. In particular, the comprehensive commentary of the Mu&#x27;tazilite scholar Ibn Abil-Hadid () may have amplified the influence of on theological speculation, philosophical thought, and literary scope. In it, he describes as &quot;below the speech of the Creator but above the speech of creatures.&quot;

== Authenticity ==
The compilation of is often credited to Sharif al-Radi (), a renowned Shia scholar who lived over three hundred years after Ali. A poet of some merit, al-Radi came from a distinguished Shia family in Baghdad and had connections to the Buyids, the Shia dynasty that ruled the area at the time. His intentions in compiling the book are described as &quot;literary, ethical, and spiritual,&quot; and he does not provide s, that is, chains of transmission for his texts. In view of its sometimes sensitive content, the attribution of this book to Ali or al-Radi has long been a subject of polemic debates, as with the majority of the works about Shia theology.

The authenticity of was first challenged over two centuries after al-Radi, perhaps indicating that his sources were well known during his lifetime but were lost gradually. Indeed, it was the Sunni historian Ibn Khallikan () who first suggested that the book was authored, rather than compiled, by al-Radi or by his brother Sharif al-Murtada (), another prominent Shia theologian. Yet elsewhere Ibn Khallikan cited the book without hesitation. The Sunni theologians Ibn Taymiyyah () and al-Dhahabi () have similarly rejected most of , and this has been the prevalent Sunni view to date. Among Western scholars, this view was shared by Carl Brockelmann () and Baron de Slane (), who apparently mistook the word &#x27;Murtada&#x27; on the manuscript as the name of its author and thus attributed the book to Sharif al-Murtada, probably unaware that Murtada is a well-known epithet of Ali. The Mu&#x27;tazilite Ibn Abil-Hadid was nevertheless confident that is the work of Ali, but suspected that its controversial Shaqshaqiya sermon was authored by al-Radi. Alternatively, the Sunni historian Khatib al-Baghdadi () rejected only the eschatological sermons found in the book. By contrast, the Shia regard as authentic.

=== Academic views ===
Much of the content of already exists in earlier historical works, including by the Shia historian Nasr ibn Muzahim (), by the Shia-leaning historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi (), by the Sunni historian al-Tabari (), by the Sunni author al-Jahiz (), by the Sunni historian al-Mubarrad (), and by the Sunni historian al-Baladhuri (). These authors considerably predate al-Radi, which led the Islamicist Husain M. Jafri () to confirm the attribution of to Ali. Similarly, the orientalist Laura Veccia Vaglieri () verified the attribution of &#x27;a large portion&#x27; of to Ali. Muktar Djebli, another expert, traced back &#x27;a considerable number of passages&#x27; to Ali with their s. Some recent Shia works have similarly tracked the passages of the book in earlier sources, including by Ostadi, by Abd al-Zahra al-Husayni al-Khatib, and by Abd-Allah Nima. There are also other collections attributed to Ali that predate , including by the Sunni historian Ibn al-Kalbi (), by the historian Ibn al-Nadim (), and by al-Mada&#x27;ini (), a Sunni historian.

There is also strong circumstantial evidence that al-Radi was the compiler of the book: It appears that he included fragments of passages as he found them instead of combining them, thus presenting variants of the same sermon. In particular, the passages are not in the correct chronological order. All extant manuscripts of also introduce al-Radi as the compiler of the material from Ali. Another evidence that supports the compilation of the book by ar-Radi is that he refers to his other works in the margins of and vice versa, and discloses some of his sources, namely, , , and by the Sunni historian al-Waqidi (). Finally, the linguistic style does not seem to change throughout the book, a style that has been highly praised for its eloquence () and rhetoric by some authorities, including al-Jahiz and the poet Ibn Nubata (). Indeed, one argument for the fabrication of is that its rhyming prose is too precise and polished, while the Shia counterargument is that Ali was a gifted orator, known for his , that is, improvised speech with rhyming prose. Nevertheless, some parts of were likely copy-edited, and gauging the authenticity of its sensitive passages has proved challenging.

=== Shiqshiqiya sermon ===

As for the Shiqshiqiya sermon, in which the predecessors of Ali are sharply criticized, Sunni authorities reject it as the work of al-Radi, in line with their tendency to neutralize the conflicts among the companions after Muhammad. By contrast, among others, the Shia traditionist Abdul Hosein Amini () provided several chains of transmission for this sermon, some of which predate al-Radi. Other Shia scholars accept the authenticity of this sermon but do not claim , which is the highest level of credibility in hadith terminology. Among this last group is the Shia philosopher al-Bahrani (), who also authored a commentary of . This lack of leaves the possibility that some sensitive words in the sermon were not uttered by Ali, according to the Islamic author Reza Shah-Kazemi. Alternatively, Jafri suggests that the sermon is authentic for it was also quoted in earlier works, including by the Shia traditionist (), by the Shia historian (), and by the Mu&#x27;tazilite theologian Abu al-Qasim al-Balkhi ().

=== Computational verification ===
Sarwar and Mohamed recently used computational methods, mainly stylometric analysis and machine learning, to examine the authenticity of by analyzing the &#x27;morphological segmentation&#x27; of its text. They compared the book against the works of al-Radi and his brother, and concluded that the book is internally consistent, which suggests that it can be attributed to a single author, that the book was not authored by al-Radi or by his brother, Sharif al-Murtada. The authors thus conclude that the content of can indeed be attributed to Ali.

=== Relevance ===
The debates about the authenticity of may nevertheless be irrelevant to its value as a source of spiritual and ethical teachings, particularly among the Shias. In this vein, when asked to prove the attribution of to Ali, the Shia philosopher Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai () responded, &quot;For us the person who wrote is Ali, even if he lived a century ago.&quot; The need for academic research about the book, independent of its authenticity, is a view championed by the philosopher Henry Corbin () and by Shah-Kazemi.

== Political views ==
The sermons and letters in offer a commentary on the political career of Ali as the fourth Rashidun caliph, succeeding Uthman (), Umar (), and Abu Bakr (), who established the caliphate after the death of Muhammad in 632. Some sermons outlines the obligations of a leader, perhaps in response to the criticism from the Kharijites, a faction of Ali&#x27;s army that abandoned him after the inconclusive Battle of Siffin in 657 against his archenemy Mu&#x27;awiya. 


While Veccia Vaglieri wrote that Ali shows no inclination to legitimism in Sunni reports, multiple sermons in suggest instead that he viewed himself as the rightful successor of Muhammad by virtue of his merits and his kinship with the prophet. Other speeches in further indicate that he also saw the leadership as a prerogative of the Ahl al-Bayt, that is, the family of Muhammad. The legitimist view attributed to Ali in , that he unequivocally considered the caliphate to be his right after Muhammad, is corroborated by some experts, including Mahmoud M. Ayoub (), Wilferd Madelung (), Hamid Mavani, Moojan Momen, and Shah-Kazemi. Some of these authors add that Ali also considered himself as the designated successor of Muhammad, probably referring to Muhammad&#x27;s announcement at the Ghadir Khumm. Soon after his death, however, it became clear that Ali did not enjoy popular support, which is perhaps why he resigned himself to the caliphate of Abu Bakr, likely for the sake of the unity of a nascent Islam. Mavani and Maria M. Dakake, another Islamicist, nevertheless suggest that Ali viewed the succession of Abu Bakr as a digression which turned into a full-blown deviation with the rebellion of Mu&#x27;awiya during his own caliphate. This matches the Shia view, as represented by the Shia jurist Ruhollah Khomeini (). By contrast, Ali mounts only a passing resistance to the caliphate of Abu Bakr (if any at all) in Sunni reports, which Ayoub describes as apologetic.




Yet there is also evidence in that Ali regarded public endorsement as necessary for a legitimate rule. On this basis, Mavani speculates that Ali would have not sought the title of caliph had Muslims withheld their support from him after the assassination of Uthman in 656. When the Muslim community favored him, however, Ali probably no longer considered the caliphate as his right, but also as his duty.

== Letter to al-Ashtar ==

The letter of instructions addressed to Malik al-Ashtar, the newly appointed governor of Ali in Egypt, outlines his conception of just and righteous governance. The theme of the letter can be summarized as justice and compassion for all, regardless of class, creed, and color. The letter also advises Malik to view his rule as a means of encouraging religious awakening and spiritual well-being within the community, to be a role model for his staff and others, to strive for justice and monitor his staff for its enforcement, and to consult often with his staff. Malik was killed in 657 at the instigation of Mu&#x27;awiya en route to Egypt to assume his post.





== Letter to Ibn Hunayf ==

A letter of admonishment in is addressed to Uthman ibn Hunayf, the governor of Ali in Basra, who is said to have attended a lavish banquet, one which &quot;rudely rebuffed the needy, and warmly embraced the wealthy,&quot; the letter adds.

<doc id="839887" wikidata="Q1680302" url="?curid=839887" title="Real-time gross settlement">
<text>Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems are specialist funds transfer systems where the transfer of money or securities takes place from one bank to any other bank on a &quot;real-time&quot; and on a &quot;gross&quot; basis to avoid settlement risk. Settlement in &quot;real time&quot; means a payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period, with transactions being settled as soon as they are processed. &quot;Gross settlement&quot; means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one basis, without bundling or netting with any other transaction. &quot;Settlement&quot; means that once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.

==History==
As of 1985, three central banks implemented RTGS systems, while by the end of 2005, RTGS systems had been implemented by 90 central banks.

The first system that had the attributes of an RTGS system was the US Fedwire system which was launched in 1970. This was based on a previous method of transferring funds electronically between US federal reserve banks via telegraph. The United Kingdom and France both independently developed RTGS type systems in 1984. The UK system was developed by the Bankers&#x27; Clearing House in February 1984 and was called CHAPS. The French system was called SAGITTAIRE. A number of other developed countries launched systems over the next few years. These systems were diverse in operation and technology, being country-specific as they were usually based upon previous processes and procedures used in each country.

In the 1990s international finance organizations emphasized the importance of large-value funds transfer systems which banks use to settle interbank transfers for their own account as well as for their customers as a key part of a country&#x27;s financial market infrastructure. By 1997 a number of countries, inside as well as outside the Group of Ten, had introduced real-time gross settlement systems for large-value funds transfers. Nearly all G-10 countries had plans to have RTGS systems in operation in the course of 1997 and many other countries were also considering introducing such systems.

==Operation==
RTGS systems are usually operated by a country&#x27;s central bank as it is seen as critical infrastructure for a country&#x27;s economy. Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money.

RTGS system does not require any physical exchange of money; the central bank makes adjustments in the electronic accounts of Bank A and Bank B, reducing the balance in Bank A’s account by the amount in question and increasing the balance of Bank B’s account by the same amount. The RTGS system is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions. It lowers settlement risk, besides giving an accurate picture of an institution’s account at any point in time. The objective of RTGS systems by central banks throughout the world is to minimize risk in high-value electronic payment settlement systems. In an RTGS system, transactions are settled across accounts held at a central bank on a continuous gross basis. The settlement is immediate, final, and irrevocable. Credit risks due to settlement lags are eliminated. The best RTGS national payment systems cover up to 95% of high-value transactions within the national monetary market.

RTGS systems are an alternative to systems of settling transactions at the end of the day, also known as the net settlement system, such as the BACS system in the United Kingdom. In a net settlement system, all the inter-institution transactions during the day are accumulated, and at the end of the day, the central bank adjusts the accounts of the institutions by the net amounts of these transactions.

The World Bank has been paying increasing attention to payment system development as a key component of the financial infrastructure of a country and has provided various forms of assistance to over 100 countries. Most of the RTGS systems in place are secure and have been designed around international standards and best practices.

There are several reasons for central banks to adopt RTGS. First, a decision to adopt is influenced by competitive pressure from the global financial markets. Second, it is more beneficial to adopt an RTGS system for the central bank when this allows access to a broad system of other countries&#x27; RTGS systems. Third, it is very likely that the knowledge acquired through experiences with RTGS systems spills over to other central banks and helps them make their adoption decision. Fourth, central banks do not necessarily have to install and develop RTGS themselves. The possibility of sharing development with providers that have built RTGS systems in more than one country (CGI of UK holding the IP, CMA Small System of Sweden, JV Perago of South Africa, SIA S.p.A. of Italy and Montran of USA) has presumably lowered the cost and hence made it feasible for many countries to adopt.

Below is a listing of countries and their RTGS systems:


In 2010, the World Bank published a report on payment systems worldwide, which investigated these countries&#x27; usage of real-time gross settlement systems for large-value payments.

<text>The Honda HSC (Honda Sports Concept) was a concept sports car that was initially unveiled at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show. Most of the automotive media immediately speculated that it was designed to be a replacement for the Honda NSX, although this was never confirmed by Honda. It was also branded as an Acura.

The HSC featured a lightweight, mid-mounted aluminum i-VTEC V6 engine with a 6-speed transmission controlled by either an F1-style paddle shifter on the steering wheel or a unique dial shifter on the center console. When shifted into reverse, the navigation system&#x27;s adjustable flat-panel screen in the center console became a display for a rear-mounted camera. Abundant leather and aluminum trim pieces rounded out the interior, an all-aluminum frame with carbon fibre body panels kept it light, and swan doors affirmed its sports car status.

The development of this car into a production sports car appeared to stall for two years. However, the July 2005 announcement by Honda CEO Takeo Fukui indicated the HSC was only a test concept for a pure sports car.

In 2009, a road car version of the Honda HSV-010 GT was seen, with some visual similarities with the HSC. It was also assumed to be a replacement to the NSX, although there is no official confirmation of this. In 2013, Honda unveiled the next generation NSX concept car, that replaced the HSV-010 in the Super GT GT500 class.

<doc id="839900" wikidata="Q1397835" url="?curid=839900" title="Near-ring">
<text>In mathematics, a near-ring (also near ring or nearring) is an algebraic structure similar to a ring but satisfying fewer axioms. Near-rings arise naturally from functions on groups.

== Definition ==
A set &quot;N&quot; together with two binary operations + (called &quot;addition&quot;) and ⋅ (called &quot;multiplication&quot;) is called a (right) &quot;near-ring&quot; if:
* &quot;N&quot; is a group (not necessarily abelian) under addition;
* multiplication is associative (so &quot;N&quot; is a semigroup under multiplication); and
* multiplication &quot;on the right&quot; distributes over addition: for any &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; in &quot;N&quot;, it holds that (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;)⋅&quot;z&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;z&quot;) + (&quot;y&quot;⋅&quot;z&quot;).

Similarly, it is possible to define a &quot;left near-ring&quot; by replacing the right distributive law by the corresponding left distributive law. Both right and left near-rings occur in the literature; for instance, the book of Pilz uses right near-rings, while the book of Clay uses left near-rings.

An immediate consequence of this &quot;one-sided distributive law&quot; is that it is true that 0⋅&quot;x&quot; = 0 but it is not necessarily true that &quot;x&quot;⋅0 = 0 for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;N&quot;. Another immediate consequence is that (−&quot;x&quot;)⋅&quot;y&quot; = −(&quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;y&quot;) for any &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;N&quot;, but it is not necessary that &quot;x&quot;⋅(−&quot;y&quot;) = −(&quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;y&quot;). A near-ring is a rng if and only if addition is commutative and multiplication is also distributive over addition on the &quot;left&quot;. If the near-ring has a multiplicative identity, then distributivity on both sides is sufficient, and commutativity of addition follows automatically.

== Mappings from a group to itself ==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a group, written additively but not necessarily abelian, and let &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) be the set of all functions from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;G&quot;. An addition operation can be defined on &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;): given &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; in &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), then the mapping from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;G&quot; is given by for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. Then (&quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), +) is also a group, which is abelian if and only if &quot;G&quot; is abelian. Taking the composition of mappings as the product ⋅, &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) becomes a near-ring.

The 0 element of the near-ring &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the zero map, i.e., the mapping which takes every element of &quot;G&quot; to the identity element of &quot;G&quot;. The additive inverse −&quot;f&quot; of &quot;f&quot; in &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) coincides with the natural pointwise definition, that is, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

If &quot;G&quot; has at least two elements, then &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is not a ring, even if &quot;G&quot; is abelian. (Consider a constant mapping &quot;g&quot; from &quot;G&quot; to a fixed element of &quot;G&quot;; then .) However, there is a subset &quot;E&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) consisting of all group endomorphisms of &quot;G&quot;, that is, all maps such that for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. If is abelian, both near-ring operations on &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) are closed on &quot;E&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), and is a ring. If is nonabelian, &quot;E&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is generally not closed under the near-ring operations; but the closure of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) under the near-ring operations is a near-ring.

Many subsets of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) form interesting and useful near-rings. For example:
* The mappings for which .
* The constant mappings, i.e., those that map every element of the group to one fixed element.
* The set of maps generated by addition and negation from the endomorphisms of the group (the &quot;additive closure&quot; of the set of endomorphisms). If &quot;G&quot; is abelian then the set of endomorphisms is already additively closed, so that the additive closure is just the set of endomorphisms of &quot;G&quot;, and it forms not just a near-ring, but a ring.

Further examples occur if the group has further structure, for example:
* The continuous mappings in a topological group.
* The polynomial functions on a ring with identity under addition and polynomial composition.
* The affine maps in a vector space.

Every near-ring is isomorphic to a subnear-ring of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) for some &quot;G&quot;.

== Applications ==
Many applications involve the subclass of near-rings known as near-fields; for these see the article on near-fields.

There are various applications of proper near-rings, i.e., those that are neither rings nor near-fields.

The best known is to balanced incomplete block designs using planar near-rings. These are a way to obtain difference families using the orbits of a fixed-point-free automorphism group of a group. James R. Clay and others have extended these ideas to more general geometrical constructions.

<doc id="839903" wikidata="Q5375710" url="?curid=839903" title="Encyclopedia of Mormonism">
<text>The Encyclopedia of Mormonism is a semi-official English-language encyclopedia for topics relevant to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church, see also &quot;Mormon&quot;). The encyclopedia&#x27;s five volumes have been digitized and are available for free online via the Harold B. Lee Library&#x27;s official website.

==Background==
Published in 1992, the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; contains nearly 1,500 articles, including several short unattributed entries in four volumes. The text is approximately one million words, and over 1,850 pages including pictures, maps, charts, index, and appendices. The title for the &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot; was chosen by Macmillan, the publisher that initiated the project. The set was originally expected to be priced at $240 ($ in ), but has since been digitized and made available for free.

There were over 730 contributors from a wide variety of fields, most of whom had LDS and academic backgrounds. A large number were professors at Brigham Young University (BYU), the LDS Church-owned university. Most individuals contributed only one article, and few submitted more than three or four. Notable contributors include Mormon historians Leonard J. Arrington and Thomas G. Alexander, former Salt Lake City mayor Ted Wilson, noted non-Mormon LDS historian Jan Shipps, authors Steven R. Covey, Gerald N. Lund, and Richard Eyre, respected scholar and apologist Hugh Nibley, and a few general authorities, such as Jeffery R. Holland and H. David Burton.

The editor of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot;, Daniel H. Ludlow, states that he strove to make the volume as professional as possible. Most articles are written by PhDs in their respective fields. LDS Church general authorities wrote little of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;; indeed, most contributors from church hierarchy were only tapped to write articles on the publications or institutions they directly administered or led. For impartiality and perspective, several non-Mormons were asked to write important articles. For example, Shipps wrote on the outsider&#x27;s interpretation of Mormonism, and Richard P. Howard, a historian of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ), wrote on his branch of the Latter Day Saint movement.

==Subjects addressed==
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot; includes lengthy articles on core LDS subjects like LDS Church history and doctrine, but the work also includes many topics that are less closely related to Mormonism. For example, articles on constitutional law, sports, science, and freedom discuss LDS perspectives and contributions to various fields.

Ludlow also sought to make the encyclopedia accessible to non-Mormons: an optional fifth volume was printed, containing the &quot;standard works,&quot; LDS scriptures that are heavily cited in the encyclopedia.

==Role of encyclopedia relative to the LDS Church==
Although the LDS Church cooperated in the production of the book, particularly by setting aside BYU resources, the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; was meant to be independent and unofficial in the church. Ludlow highlights that in his concluding preface remarks:

:Lest the role of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; be given more weight than it deserves, the editors make it clear that those who have written and edited have only tried to explain their understanding of Church history, doctrines, and procedures; their statement and opinions remain their own. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot; is a joint product of Brigham Young University and Macmillan Publishing Company, and its contents do not necessarily represent the official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The LDS Church also noted the position in official publications.

==Views of contents==
In addition to established scholars like Nibley, many other LDS scholars who were then less known also contributed, including John Gee, William Hamblin, Louis C. Midgley, Daniel C. Peterson, Noel B. Reynolds, Stephen D. Ricks, John L. Sorenson, Melvin J. Thorne, and John W. Welch.

Critics had mixed reviews. Sterling M. McMurrin said that &quot;the articles on social issues and church structure and the biographies are the most useful&quot; but also felt that &quot;the work is a carefully sanitized partisan affair that, while having many strengths, is quite uneven in quality and, though it appears to face many difficult issues head on, clearly omits, distorts, and compromises wherever necessary to advance and protect a positive image of Mormons, Mormonism, and the church.&quot; George D. Smith praised the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; &quot;As a &#x27;religious encyclopedia&#x27; that addresses a goal of preserving a body of belief,&quot; stating it &quot;impressively fulfills its mission.&quot; However, he criticized the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;&#x27;s treatment of Book of Mormon scholarship for not being comprehensive and instead being &quot;a statement of LDS orthodoxy&quot; which &quot;presents only a portion of important background and issues concerning the Book of Mormon&quot; and &quot;lacks the scope and diversity necessary to qualify it as truly encyclopedic.&quot; The introduction to &quot;Sunstone&quot;&#x27; s review of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; mentioned that Lavina Fielding Anderson &quot;pointed out &#x27;pitfalls in the treatment of women&#x27;s issues, but revealed a few surprisingly positive moments that otherwise might have been overlooked-and probably were by some editors.&#x27; &quot;

<text>Emil Robert Voigt (31 January 1883 – 16 October 1973) was a British athlete, winner of the Olympic 5 miles race in 1908 representing Great Britain.

== Biography ==
Born in Manchester to German parents, Voigt won the 1908 Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championship in the 4 miles, making him one of the favourites for the 5 miles at the 1908 Summer Olympics, which were held in London. Voigt, a vegetarian, indeed won the race easily and became the second and last Olympic champion in the event, which was replaced by the 5000 m and 10000 m events in 1912.

After winning three more AAA titles at the 1909 AAA Championships and 1910 AAA Championships, as well as winning numerous other races in the UK and Europe, he emigrated to Australia in 1911. He won a number of Australian titles over the next three years, then retired from athletics in 1914 when the outbreak of war in Europe put an end to his career.

In Australia he became one of the foremost pioneers of early radio, helping to set up 2KY on behalf of the Labor movement.

He moved back to England in 1936, finally retiring to Auckland, New Zealand, in 1948, where he died at age 90.

== Vegetarianism ==
Voigt became a vegetarian for humanitarian motives. He also avoided tea, coffee, and lentils. He became a vegetarian at the age of 22 and joined the Vegetarian Cycling Club. His diet consisted of brown bread, eggs, fruit, milk and vegetables.

During the 1908 London Olympic Games, he was the only gold medal distance runner England had ever had and the only vegetarian out of 2023 competitors. Voigt was a non-smoker and teetotaller.

<doc id="839936" wikidata="Q859860" url="?curid=839936" title="Awesome God">
<text>&quot;Awesome God&quot; is a contemporary worship song written by Rich Mullins and first recorded on his 1988 album, &quot;Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth&quot;. It was the first single from the album and rose to the number one spot on Christian AC radio and subsequently became a popular congregational song. Its title is inspired by a biblical expression (Nehemiah 1:5, Nehemiah 9:32, Psalm 47, Daniel 9:4, etc.), variously translated as &quot;Awesome God&quot;, (JPS, in the old-fashioned meaning &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;), &quot;great&quot; (KJV), among other alternatives. Due to the popularity of the song, it became Mullins&#x27; signature song. It was also used in the 2021 Netflix movie A Week Away.

== Commentary ==
Mullins did not consider the song to be one of his best. In an interview with &quot;The Lighthouse Electronic Magazine&quot; in April 1996, he said:

You know, the thing I like about Awesome God is that it&#x27;s one of the worst-written songs that I ever wrote; it&#x27;s just poorly crafted. But the thing is that sometimes, I think, that when you become too conscientious about being a songwriter, the message becomes a vehicle for the medium. This is a temptation that I think all songwriters have. I think a great songwriter is someone who is able to take a very meaningful piece of wisdom — or of folly or whatever — and say it in a way that is most likely to make people respond. But, what you want them to respond to is not how cleverly you did that; what you want them to respond to is your message.
== Cover versions ==

Over a year after Mullins&#x27; death (in September 1997) the song was covered on a tribute album for Mullins entitled &quot;Awesome God: A Tribute to Rich Mullins&quot; by fellow Contemporary Christian musician, Michael W. Smith. Numerous other Christian artists have performed versions in numerous styles, from ska to swing to rock and traditional worship style, even hardcore punk and heavy metal by the bands Unashamed and Pantokrator.

<doc id="839943" wikidata="Q68833" url="?curid=839943" title="Bone fracture">
<text>A bone fracture (abbreviated FRX or Fx, Fx, or #) is a medical condition in which there is a partial or complete break in the continuity of any bone in the body. In more severe cases, the bone may be broken into several fragments, known as a &quot;comminuted fracture&quot;. An open fracture (or compound fracture) is a bone fracture where the broken bone breaks through the skin. 

A bone fracture may be the result of high force impact or stress, or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture. Most bone fractures require urgent medical attention to prevent further injury.

==Signs and symptoms==
Although bone tissue contains no pain receptors, a bone fracture is painful for several reasons:
* Breaking in the continuity of the periosteum, with or without similar discontinuity in endosteum, as both contain multiple pain receptors.
* Edema and hematoma of nearby soft tissues caused by ruptured bone marrow evokes pressure pain.
* Involuntary muscle spasms trying to hold bone fragments in place.

Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves, muscles or blood vessels, spinal cord, and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) may cause other specific signs and symptoms.

===Complications===

Some fractures may lead to serious complications including a condition known as compartment syndrome. If not treated, eventually, compartment syndrome may require amputation of the affected limb. Other complications may include non-union, where the fractured bone fails to heal, or malunion, where the fractured bone heals in a deformed manner. One form of malunion is the malrotation of a bone, which is especially common after femoral and tibial fractures.
Complications of fractures may be classified into three broad groups, depending upon their time of occurrence. These are as follows –
# &quot;Immediate&quot; complications – occurs at the time of the fracture.
# &quot;Early&quot; complications – occurring in the initial few days after the fracture.
# &quot;Late&quot; complications – occurring a long time after the fracture.

==Pathophysiology==
The natural process of healing a fracture starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture hematoma. The blood coagulates to form a blood clot situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days, blood vessels grow into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring phagocytes to the area, which gradually removes the non-viable material. The blood vessels also bring fibroblasts in the walls of the vessels and these multiply and produce collagen fibres. In this way, the blood clot is replaced by a matrix of collagen. Collagen&#x27;s rubbery consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent force is applied.

At this stage, some of the fibroblasts begin to lay down bone matrix in the form of collagen monomers. These monomers spontaneously assemble to form the bone matrix, for which bone crystals (calcium hydroxyapatite) are deposited in amongst, in the form of insoluble crystals. This mineralization of the collagen matrix stiffens it and transforms it into bone. In fact, bone &quot;is&quot; a mineralized collagen matrix; if the mineral is dissolved out of bone, it becomes rubbery. Healing bone callus on average is sufficiently mineralized to show up on X-ray within 6 weeks in adults and less in children. This initial &quot;woven&quot; bone does not have the strong mechanical properties of mature bone. By a process of remodelling, the woven bone is replaced by mature &quot;lamellar&quot; bone. The whole process may take up to 18 months, but in adults, the strength of the healing bone is usually 80% of normal by 3 months after the injury.

Several factors may help or hinder the bone healing process. For example, tobacco smoking hinders the process of bone healing, and adequate nutrition (including calcium intake) will help the bone healing process. Weight-bearing stress on bone, after the bone has healed sufficiently to bear the weight, also builds bone strength.

Although there are theoretical concerns about NSAIDs slowing the rate of healing, there is not enough evidence to warrant withholding the use of this type analgesic in simple fractures.

===Effects of smoking===

Smokers generally have lower bone density than non-smokers, so they have a much higher risk of fractures. There is also evidence that smoking delays bone healing.

==Diagnosis==

A bone fracture may be diagnosed based on the history given and the physical examination performed. Radiographic imaging often is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Under certain circumstances, radiographic examination of the nearby joints is indicated in order to exclude dislocations and fracture-dislocations. In situations where projectional radiography alone is insufficient, Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be indicated.

===Classification===

In orthopedic medicine, fractures are classified in various ways. Historically they are named after the physician who first described the fracture conditions, however, there are more systematic classifications as well.

They may be divided into stable versus unstable depending on the likelihood that they may shift further.

====Mechanism====
* Traumatic fracture – a fracture due to sustained trauma. e.g., fractures caused by a fall, road traffic accident, fight, etc.
* Pathologic fracture – a fracture through a bone that has been made weak by some underlying disease is called pathological fracture. e.g., a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathological fracture.
* Periprosthetic fracture – a fracture at the point of mechanical weakness at the end of an implant.

====Soft-tissue involvement====
* Closed/simple fractures are those in which the overlying skin is intact
* Open/compound fractures involve wounds that communicate with the fracture, or where fracture hematoma is exposed, and may thus expose bone to contamination. Open injuries carry a higher risk of infection. Reports indicate an incidence of infection after internal fixation of closed fracture of 1-2%, rising to 30% in open fractures.
** Clean fracture
** Contaminated fracture

====Displacement====
* Non-displaced
* Displaced
** Translated, or &quot;ad latus&quot;, with sideways displacement.
** Angulated
** Rotated
** Shortened, a reduction in overall bone length when displaced fracture fragments overlap

====Fracture pattern====

* Linear fracture – a fracture that is parallel to the bone&#x27;s long axis
* Transverse fracture – a fracture that is at a right angle to the bone&#x27;s long axis
* Oblique fracture – a fracture that is diagonal to a bone&#x27;s long axis (more than 30°)
* Spiral fracture – a fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted
* Compression fracture/wedge fracture – usually occurs in the vertebrae, for example when the front portion of a vertebra in the spine collapses due to osteoporosis (a medical condition which causes bones to become brittle and susceptible to fracture, with or without trauma)
* Impacted fracture – a fracture caused when bone fragments are driven into each other
* Avulsion fracture – a fracture where a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass

====Fragments====
* Incomplete fracture – a fracture in which the bone fragments are still partially joined, in such cases, there is a crack in the osseous tissue that does not completely traverse the width of the bone.
* Complete fracture – a fracture in which bone fragments separate completely.
* Comminuted fracture – a fracture in which the bone has broken into several pieces.

====Anatomical location====
An anatomical classification may begin with specifying the involved body part, such as the head or arm, followed by more specific localization. Fractures that have additional definition criteria than merely localization often may be classified as subtypes of fractures, such as a Holstein-Lewis fracture being a subtype of a humerus fracture. Most typical examples in an orthopaedic classification given in the previous section cannot be classified appropriately into any specific part of an anatomical classification, however, as they may apply to multiple anatomical fracture sites.
* Skull fracture
** Basilar skull fracture
** Blowout fracture – a fracture of the walls or floor of the orbit

===OTA/AO classification===

The Orthopaedic Trauma Association Committee for Coding and Classification published its classification system in 1996, adopting a similar system to the 1987 AO Foundation system. In 2007, they extended their system, unifying the two systems regarding wrist, hand, foot, and ankle fractures.

===Classifications named after people===

A number of classifications are named after the person (eponymous) who developed it.
* &quot;Denis classification&quot; for spinal fractures 
* &quot;Frykman classification&quot; for forearm fractures (fractures of radius and ulna)
* &quot;Gustilo open fracture classification&quot; 
* &quot;Letournel and Judet Classification&quot; for Acetabular fractures 
* &quot;Neer classification&quot; for humerus fractures 
* Seinsheimer classification, Evans-Jensen classification, Pipkin classification, and Garden classification for hip fractures

== Prevention ==
Both high- and low-force trauma can cause bone fracture injuries. Preventive efforts to reduce motor vehicle crashes, the most common cause of high-force trauma, include reducing distractions while driving. Common distractions are driving under the influence and texting or calling while driving, both of which lead to an approximate 6-fold increase in crashes. Wearing a seatbelt can also reduce the likelihood of injury in a collision. 30 km/h or 20 mph speed limits (as opposed to the more common intracity 50 km/h / 30 mph) also drastically reduce the risk of accident, serious injury and even death in crashes between motor vehicles and humans. Vision Zero aims to reduce traffic deaths to zero through better traffic design and other measures and to drastically reduce traffic injuries which would prevent many bone fractures.

A common cause of low-force trauma is an at-home fall. When considering preventative efforts, the National Institute of Health (NIH) examines ways to reduce the likelihood of falling, the force of the fall, and bone fragility. To prevent at-home falls they suggest keeping cords out of high-traffic areas where someone could trip, installing handrails and keeping stairways well-lit, and installing an assistive bar near the bathtub in the washroom for support. To reduce the impact of a fall the NIH recommends to try falling straight down on your buttocks or onto your hands.

Some sports have a relatively high risk of bone fractures as a common sports injury. Preventive measures depend to some extent on the specific sport, but learning proper technique, wearing protective gear and having a realistic estimation of one&#x27;s own capabilities and limitations can all help reduce the risk of bone fracture. In contact sports rules have been put in place to protect athlete health, such as the prohibition of unnecessary roughness in American football.

Taking calcium and vitamin D supplements can help strengthen your bones. Vitamin D supplements combined with additional calcium marginally reduces the risk of hip fractures and other types of fracture in older adults; however, vitamin D supplementation alone did not reduce the risk of fractures. Taking vibration therapy can also help strengthening bones and reducing the risk of a fracture.

== Patterns ==
==Treatment==

Treatment of bone fractures are broadly classified as surgical or conservative, the latter basically referring to any non-surgical procedure, such as pain management, immobilization or other non-surgical stabilization. A similar classification is &quot;open&quot; versus &quot;closed treatment&quot;, in which &quot;open treatment&quot; refers to any treatment in which the fracture site is opened surgically, regardless of whether the fracture is an open or closed fracture.

===Pain management===
In arm fractures in children, ibuprofen has been found to be as effective as a combination of paracetamol and codeine. In the EMS setting it might be applicable to administer 1mg/kg of iv ketamine to achieve a dissociated state.

===Immobilization===
Since bone healing is a natural process that will occur most often, fracture treatment aims to ensure the best possible &quot;function&quot; of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in a good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray is all that is needed. This process is extremely painful without anaesthesia, about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fibreglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. 

When the initial post-fracture oedema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or orthosis. If being treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of an external fixator.

Occasionally smaller bones, such as phalanges of the toes and fingers, may be treated without the cast, by buddy wrapping them, which serves a similar function to making a cast. A device called a Suzuki frame may be used in cases of deep, complex intra-articular digit fractures. By allowing only limited movement, immobilization helps preserve anatomical alignment while enabling callus formation, toward the target of achieving union.

Splinting results in the same outcome as casting in children who have a distal radius fracture with little shifting.

===Surgery===
Surgical methods of treating fractures have their own risks and benefits, but usually, surgery is performed only if conservative treatment has failed, is very likely to fail, or is likely to result in a poor functional outcome. With some fractures such as hip fractures (usually caused by osteoporosis), surgery is offered routinely because non-operative treatment results in prolonged immobilisation, which commonly results in complications including chest infections, pressure sores, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism, which are more dangerous than surgery. When a joint surface is damaged by a fracture, surgery is also commonly recommended to make an accurate anatomical reduction and restore the smoothness of the joint.

Infection is especially dangerous in bones, due to the recrudescent nature of bone infections. Bone tissue is predominantly extracellular matrix, rather than living cells, and the few blood vessels needed to support this low metabolism are only able to bring a limited number of immune cells to an injury to fight infection. For this reason, open fractures and osteotomies call for very careful antiseptic procedures and prophylactic use of antibiotics.

Occasionally, bone grafting is used to treat a fracture.

Sometimes bones are reinforced with metal. These implants must be designed and installed with care. &quot;Stress shielding&quot; occurs when plates or screws carry too large of a portion of the bone&#x27;s load, causing atrophy. This problem is reduced, but not eliminated, by the use of low-modulus materials, including titanium and its alloys. The heat generated by the friction of installing hardware can accumulate easily and damage bone tissue, reducing the strength of the connections. If dissimilar metals are installed in contact with one another (i.e., a titanium plate with cobalt-chromium alloy or stainless steel screws), galvanic corrosion will result. The metal ions produced can damage the bone locally and may cause systemic effects as well.

=== Bone stimulation ===
Bone stimulation with either electromagnetic or ultrasound waves may be suggested as an alternative to surgery to reduce the healing time for non-union fractures. The proposed mechanism of action is by stimulating osteoblasts and other proteins that form bones using these modalities. The evidence supporting the use of ultrasound and shockwave therapy for improving unions is very weak and it is likely that these approaches do not make a clinically significant difference for a delayed union or non-union.

=== Physical therapy ===
Physical therapy exercises (either home-based or physiotherapist-led) to improve functional mobility and strength, gait training for hip fractures, and other physical exercise are also often suggested to help recover physical capacities after a fracture has healed.

==Children==

In children, whose bones are still developing, there are risks of either a growth plate injury or a greenstick fracture.
* A greenstick fracture occurs due to mechanical failure on the tension side. That is since the bone is not so brittle as it would be in an adult, it does not completely fracture, but rather exhibits bowing without complete disruption of the bone&#x27;s cortex in the surface opposite the applied force.
* Growth plate injuries, as in Salter-Harris fractures, require careful treatment and accurate reduction to make sure that the bone continues to grow normally.
* Plastic deformation of the bone, in which the bone permanently bends, but does not break, also is possible in children. These injuries may require an osteotomy (bone cut) to realign the bone if it is fixed and cannot be realigned by closed methods.
* Certain fractures mainly occur in children, including fracture of the clavicle and supracondylar fracture of the humerus.

<text>Sigvard Oscar Fredrik, Prince Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (7 June 1907 – 4 February 2002) born as, and until 1934 known as, Prince Sigvard of Sweden, Duke of Uppland, was a member of the Swedish Royal Family and a successful industrial designer.

He was the second son of the future King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught, eldest daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and granddaughter of Britain&#x27;s Queen Victoria. He was a Prince of Sweden from birth, but was excluded from the line of succession in 1934 when he married a woman of unequal rank, a violation of provisions prohibiting marriages between a Prince and a &quot;private man&#x27;s daughter&quot; (), in force at the time, contained in both the 1809 Instrument of Government and the 1810 Act of Succession, and, in addition, he lost his princely and ducal titles as decided by the King in Council. As per the king&#x27;s wishes, he was then to be called only &quot;Mr. Sigvard Bernadotte&quot; in Sweden. In 1951, he was granted Luxembourgian titles of nobility, the interpretation of which remained a point of contention with the Royal Court for the rest of his life, Bernadotte having formally declared in 1983 that his title was Prince Sigvard Bernadotte.

Bernadotte was a paternal uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and a maternal uncle of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.

==Early life==
Bernadotte was born at 7 June 1907 on Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm as the second child of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and Princess Margaret of Connaught. He graduated from Lundsbergs School in 1926 and went on to study political science and art history at Uppsala University. Upon graduating in 1929, he became the first member of the House of Bernadotte to earn an academic degree. In 1930, he was admitted to the design school Konstfack.

During World War II, Bernadotte served as Lieutenant in the Svea Life Guards.

==Professional life==
After World War II, Bernadotte became creative director of Georg Jensen A/S. His original art deco &quot;Bernadotte&quot; collection was designed in 1938 and remains a stable in the company&#x27;s product range to this day. He continued his collaboration with Georg Jensen until 1980.

In 1950, he and Danish architect and designer Acton Bjørn founded the design studio Bernadotte &amp; Bjørn Industrial A/S in Copenhagen.

Among his iconic designs were the Red Clara opener; EKA Swede 38 folding knife; the Margrethe bowl – named for his niece Queen Margrethe II of Denmark; the Bernadotte jug, and the Facit Private typewriter. He also designed glasses frames.

In 1964, Bernadotte opened his own studio Bernadotte Design AB in Stockholm.

He worked as an assistant director at MGM in Culver City, California and served as a technical advisor on the 1937 film &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.

He appeared briefly in the 1968 Italian mondo film &quot;&quot;. His work in industrial design at Bernadotte Design AB is featured, along with select items from his portfolio.

==Title==
Bernadotte was born Prince of Sweden and Duke of Uppland, but having made an unequal match was disqualified from the line of succession. He was also forbidden to use his birth titles and left to be called &quot;Mr. Bernadotte&quot;. His cousin Lennart Bernadotte, who two years earlier had experienced the same thing (as the first Swede in history), considered himself, and even more so Sigvard, subjected to very cruel treatment for several decades by the Royal Court of Sweden due to their marriages.

On 2 July 1951, for himself, his wife and his marital descendants, Bernadotte was admitted by Grand Duchess Charlotte (head of state at the time) into the nobility of Luxembourg with the title Count of Wisborg. and in that conferral was also called &quot;Sigvard Oscar Frederik Prince Bernadotte&quot;.

After more than 30 years of argument and controversy in Sweden over his rank and titles, problems which worsened when his father died in 1973, and fed up after having been demonstratively snubbed by the Royal Court of Sweden during a state visit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1983, Bernadotte announced to Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå on 28 May of that year that he was to be known as &quot;Prince Sigvard Bernadotte&quot; from then on.

Over the years since then, based on precedent established in 1888 for his great-uncle Oscar, and citing Oscar&#x27;s title of nobility as it was confirmed by the Government of Luxembourg in 1892, Bernadotte was supported by several legal experts when he petitioned for acknowledgement in Sweden of the &quot;Prince Bernadotte&quot; title as his also, although he did not seek reinstatement in the line of succession to the throne as a royal prince of that country. King Carl XVI Gustaf has been criticized for never obliging and for his consequent estrangement from his uncle.

Bernadotte went to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to have the Government of Sweden acknowledge his princely title there, but in 2004, after his death, the ECHR declared the application inadmissible.

==Marriages==
He married Erica Maria Regina Rosalie Patzek (1911–2007) on 8 March 1934. She was the daughter of German businessman Anton Patzek and his wife Maria Anna Lála. The wedding took place in Caxton Hall in London and the witnesses were the bride&#x27;s brother Georg Patzek and a lawyer Mr Gordon. Sigvard lost all royal privileges following the wedding and started his silver design business. They were divorced on 14 October 1943.

Bernadotte remarried a Danish woman, Sonja Helene Robbert (1909–2004), on 26 October 1943 and they were divorced on 6 June 1961. They had one son: Michael (born 21 August 1944).

Lastly, Bernadotte married Swedish actress Marianne Lindberg Tchang on 30 July 1961.

From 1994 to 2002, he was the oldest living great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, and having reached the age of 94, he was her longest-lived male descendant until being overtaken by his younger brother Carl Johan on 29 June 2011.

==Death==
Bernadotte died on 4 February 2002 at the nursing home Borgarhemmet in Stockholm. His funeral took place on 15 February 2002 in Engelbrekt Church and was attended by members of both the Swedish and the Danish royal families. He is buried at Royal Cemetery in Hagaparken and the wording on his gravestone, does make it clear that he was &quot;born Prince of Sweden&quot;.

<text>Randburg is an area located in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Formerly a separate municipality, its administration devolved to the newly created City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, along with neighbouring Sandton and Roodepoort, in the late 1990s. During the transitional period of 1996–2000, Randburg was part of the Northern Metropolitan Local Council (MLC).

== History ==
Early History of Randburg

The earliest known inhabitants of the area now called Randburg were indigenous tribes who roamed the open veld. Evidence of their Iron Age craftsmanship, including tools and pottery, can still be found on some of the local koppies (small hills). However, much about their culture and history remains undocumented and largely unknown.

The Boer Settlements

Randburg&#x27;s recorded history began in the mid-19th century when Boer pioneers settled four farms in the area: Klipfontein, Driefontein, Olievenhoutspoort, and Boskop. These farms were later subdivided among the sons of the original farmers, following the tradition of the time. Driefontein, one of the largest farms, originally stretched from the northern boundary of Bryanston to present-day Braamfontein, eventually being divided into nine plots.

One of the plots was purchased by Charles Rocher, a Frenchman from Bordeaux, who named his section after his hometown. Rocher was an early pioneer of Cape deciduous fruit farming in the Transvaal, and remnants of his orchards can still be found on some of the older plots in the area. Another portion of the Boskop farm was bought by Dale Lace, a well-known Rand entrepreneur, who converted a farmhouse into a country residence. This home, restored by Tom Kelly in 1929 and renamed &quot;Hy-Many,&quot; is currently under consideration for designation as a National Monument.

Randburg and the Gold Rush

The discovery of gold in the region brought significant attention to Randburg. Wealthy English investors, such as Abe Bailey, saw the area as a prime opportunity for investment. Streets like Carlton Road, Church Street, and Pritchard Street were established in what was once open veld. The abundance of wildlife, particularly antelopes and birds, also made Randburg a popular hunting destination during this period. The name &quot;Hunters Hill&quot; is a reminder of these times when game was plentiful in the area.

The Great Depression and Development

The Great Depression of 1928-1934 and a severe drought that lasted four years led to a significant influx of platteland (rural) farmers into Randburg. Many of these new settlers preferred the rural environment and chose to build their homes in the area, often without any state assistance. Life in Randburg was simple and self-sufficient, with an abundance of food available locally.

By 1950, Randburg&#x27;s population had grown to fewer than 9,000 inhabitants. However, rapid development followed, and by 1960, the population had expanded, new townships were established, and the local newspaper &quot;Noord-Nuus&quot; began publication. As businesses flourished, the question of municipal status arose—whether Randburg should remain independent or be incorporated into Johannesburg. In 1959, following a public competition, the name &quot;Randburg&quot; was chosen, and the area was inaugurated as a municipality.

Autonomy and the Establishment of Randburg

The establishment of Randburg as an independent town was driven by a self-appointed committee led by Robert van Tonder, a dynamic leader and District Secretary of the National Party. In 1956, van Tonder founded the Dorpsraadaksiekomitee with the aim of creating a town with an Afrikaans character, distinct from the predominantly English Johannesburg, which he viewed as politically left-leaning. The committee&#x27;s petition for independence was supported by the Lorentz Commission, which, after considering the evidence, recommended the establishment of Randburg as a separate town. Randburg officially came into being on July 1, 1959.

The Path to Autonomy

During the process of establishing Randburg&#x27;s autonomy, local elections were held in the North-Western Johannesburg Local Area Committee (LAC). The enthusiasm for independence was high in Randburg, contrasting with the apathy in other areas of Northern and North-Eastern Johannesburg. The success of Randburg&#x27;s residents in securing independence inspired other areas north of Johannesburg to push for greater autonomy.

Conflict with the Provincial Authorities

In the 1950s, tensions arose between the Provincial Administration and the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board (PUAHB), which had jurisdiction over Randburg. The Board, responsible for providing services and maintaining sanitary conditions, was reluctant to relinquish control over Randburg, fearing that it would become a financially insecure and poorly managed town. Despite the Board&#x27;s opposition, the Province supported the move towards local autonomy, leading to Randburg&#x27;s eventual independence.

The Lorentz Commission&#x27;s findings and the Province&#x27;s determination to promote autonomy marked a turning point in the development of Randburg, paving the way for its growth into a thriving, self-governing municipality. By 1972, the Randburg Town Council had established guidelines for the development of residential areas, the central business district (CBD), and industrial zones, setting the stage for the area&#x27;s future growth and prosperity.

Although economically linked to Johannesburg, residents chose to create their own town council. The name &quot;Randburg&quot; was chosen in a competition, and is derived from the South African Rand currency, which was introduced at around the same time that the new municipality was established in 1959. Like other affluent northern suburbs of Johannesburg, the area was regarded as relatively liberal and elected Democratic Party members of parliament. As Apartheid ended, it became more supportive of F. W. de Klerk&#x27;s reform-minded National Party. In 1962, it became a municipality.

The resident demographic of Randburg tends to be more affluent than most of Johannesburg. The area was declared as a white area during the Apartheid era, but post-apartheid has attracted a varied population. In 2001, it was still predominantly occupied by white English and Afrikaans suburbanites.

== Geography ==
Randburg is located 18 km north-west of Johannesburg&#x27;s Central Business District (CBD) on the northwestern rural-urban fringe of the Greater Johannesburg metropolis and is flanked by Johannesburg to the south, Sandton to the east, Roodepoort to the west and the rural areas of Chartwell and Farmall to the north.

<text>Visible Noise is a defunct British independent record label that focuses exclusively on British bands. They are best known for the rock bands Lostprophets, Bullet For My Valentine, and Bring Me the Horizon.

==History==

Visible Noise, founded in 1998 by Julie Weir with the aim of promoting new British rock music and bringing it to the cultural zeitgeist, the label emerged as a significant player in the UK rock and heavy metal music scene, primarily focusing on promoting British bands. The label&#x27;s inception was a strategic move to counter the dominant attention that American bands were receiving at the time, with a goal to bring UK rock music to the forefront. Visible Noise quickly became synonymous with the promotion of UK rock music, notably elevating bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Bullet for My Valentine, and Lostprophets to mainstream success. This effort significantly contributed to putting UK rock music on the map and indicated the label&#x27;s dedication to discovering and nurturing new talent.

The label&#x27;s roster included a variety of bands, reflecting its commitment to a diverse and dynamic UK rock scene. Notably, Bring Me the Horizon signed with Visible Noise in 2005, releasing their debut album &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot; in 2006, which played a pivotal role in their rise to prominence in the UK rock music scene. Bullet for My Valentine, a Welsh heavy metal band, also found success after signing with Visible Noise in 2004. Lostprophets, another Welsh alternative rock band, had a significant stint with the label, starting in 1999, until their disbandment in 2013. Visible Noise was responsible for releasing several successful albums for these bands, which greatly contributed to their growth and popularity.

As of 2023, there are indications that Visible Noise has been inactive since 2017. The label&#x27;s official website and social media pages, such as Facebook, appear to be offline, and there have been no recent updates on its YouTube channel or announcements of new music releases. This inactivity marks a pause in the label&#x27;s operations, which had previously been instrumental in the growth and success of several UK rock bands. Label founder Julie Weir is now the label director of Music for Nations.

As of September 2024, the company is still listed as active and registered with Companies House in the UK. However, during an interview with UPRAWR Podcast in 2024, label founder Julie Weir stated that the label had ceased operations in 2016 due to financial problems partially stemming from the charges against Lostprophets vocalist Ian Watkins.

==Bands==
The following is a list of bands who were signed to the Visible Noise label during the period in which it was active:

* Ancient Ceremony
* Blitz Kids

* Bring Me the Horizon

<text>Lee James Gaze (born 21 May 1975) is a Welsh musician. He is the lead guitarist, and one of the founding members, of the Welsh/American alternative rock band No Devotion, and a former member of the Welsh rock band Lostprophets.

==Early life==
Gaze was born in Pontypridd and grew up on a council estate in the Pontypridd village Rhydyfelin. He did not do well at school as he was more interested in playing thrash metal: as he told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2006, &quot;Before I discovered music, I was a total delinquent, and then Iron Maiden changed my life. I had just been listening to pop before that. A friend of mine got hold of a tape and played to me and we got obsessed.&quot; He was also a huge fan of Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer.

==Career==
In 1991, Gaze formed his first band. They recorded one demo, &quot;Discontent&quot; and in 1994 they joined forces with two other local musicians and formed Fleshbind. The band recorded three demos and saw some success in their three-year career, including playing a show for Metal Hammer at the London Astoria.

Tired with the lack of direction, Gaze and Watkins disbanded Fleshbind and formed Lostprophets alongside Mike Chiplin on drums, later recruiting Mike Lewis, Stuart Richardson and Jamie Oliver. Gaze was the lead guitarist and one of the band&#x27;s key songwriters.
Lostprophets disbanded in October 2013 after Watkins was arrested, and then jailed for 29 years. The remaining members later formed a new band, No Devotion, with Geoff Rickly as lead singer. The band have released two albums, &quot;Permanence&quot; (2015) and &quot;No Oblivion&quot; (2022).

==Personal life==
Gaze began dating London-based Malaysian former singer, Syirin Said, who was a former member of now-defunct Malaysian girl group, M&#x27;Steen, in 2004 and they were married in 2008. The couple have two sons.

Gaze is straight edge and abstains from alcohol, smoking, and recreational drugs.

<doc id="839957" wikidata="Q437019" url="?curid=839957" title="Carl Johan Bernadotte">
<text>Carl Johan Arthur, Prince Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg, (31 October 1916 – 5 May 2012) was the fourth son and fifth and youngest child of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught.

Bernadotte was born a Prince of Sweden and granted the title of Duke of Dalarna but renounced these titles to marry a commoner. He was the uncle of two reigning monarchs, Margrethe II of Denmark and Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, as well as one queen consort, Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. He was also the last surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert.

==Early life==
Bernadotte was born on 31 October 1916 on Stockholm Palace as the youngest surviving child of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and Princess Margaret of Connaught. He graduated from Lundsbergs School in 1935 and enlisted in the Swedish army where he achieved the rank of Captain before leaving the service in 1948.

Near the end of World War II, Bernadotte was allegedly considered for the Hungarian throne although nothing came of it.

==Marriages and children==
Bernadotte lost his succession rights to the Swedish throne and renounced his titles in 1946 when he married the journalist Elin &quot;Kerstin&quot; Margaretha Wijkmark (4 October 1910 – 11 September 1987), daughter of Henning Wijkmark and wife Elin Larsson, in New York City on 19 February. As his unconstitutional marriage to Wijkmark - &quot;enskild mans dotter&quot; (daughter of a common man) - could not be approved by the Swedish government, Bernadotte knew he was giving up his Swedish titles and succession rights.

They adopted two children:
* &quot;Monica&quot; Kristina Margaretha Bernadotte (born 5 March 1948, adopted in 1951), who married Count Johan Peder Bonde af Björnö (born 5 May 1950) on 16 January 1976. They had three children and were divorced in 1997.
* &quot;Christian&quot; Carl Henning Bernadotte (born 3 December 1949, adopted in 1950), who married Marianne Jenny (born 31 January 1958, daughter of Jacques Jenny and Caroline Yvonne Venter) on 13 September 1980. They have three children.

The Bernadottes lived for some time in New York City, where he worked as the representative of the Anglo-Nordic Trading Company. They made friends with the film star Greta Garbo, who stayed with them in their Swedish home near Båstad.

On 29 September 1988, the widowed Bernadotte married his childhood friend, the Swedish noblewoman Countess Gunnila Märtha Louise Wachtmeister of Johannishus (12 May 1923 – 12 September 2016), in the Swedish Gustaf&#x27;s Church in Copenhagen, Denmark. After the ceremony, his sister, Queen Ingrid, hosted a wedding banquet for the couple at Fredensborg Palace. Upon marrying Wachtmeister, Bernadotte became the stepfather of her two surviving children from her previous marriage.

Bernadotte was a regular guest at Danish and Swedish royal engagements up until his death. In 2009, he and his wife were among the guests at Count Henrik of Monpezat&#x27;s christening at Møgeltønder Church. It was since speculated that the grandson of his niece, Queen Margrethe II, received the name Carl in his honour.

==Death==
Carl Johan Bernadotte died on 5 May 2012 at Ängelholm Hospital in Skåne. His funeral took place at Båstad Church on 14 May 2012 and was attended among others by the Swedish royal family as well as his nieces, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Princess Benedikte of Denmark and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. On 15 May, a service of thanksgiving was held at the Royal Chapel of Stockholm Palace, after which Bernadotte was buried at Royal Cemetery in Hagaparken.

<text>Carolyn Cole (born April 24, 1961) is a staff photographer for the&quot; Los Angeles Times&quot;. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography in 2004 for her coverage of the siege of Monrovia in 2003, the capital of Liberia.

==Education==
Cole graduated from the University of Texas in 1983 with a bachelor of arts, majoring in photojournalism. She earned a master of arts from the School of Visual Communication in the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University.

==Career beginnings==
She began her career in 1986 as a staff photographer with the &quot;El Paso Herald-Post&quot;, a position which she occupied until 1988. She then moved to the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; for two years, before spending another two years as a freelance photographer in Mexico City, working with newspapers such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, and &quot;Business Week&quot;. In 1992, Cole returned to being a staff photographer, working for &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, before moving to the &quot;Times&quot; in 1994.

==Recognitions==
In 1994, the same year she moved to the &quot;Times&quot;, she was recognized in their editorial awards for her pictures of the crisis in Haiti. The following year, she was recognized again, this time for her work in Russia. In 1997, she gained attention for her photographs of dying bank robber Emil Mătăsăreanu, who had been shot after a nationally televised shootout with police. Her evidence was used in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by his family. Her pictures also helped the Times win a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the event. Later that year, she was named Journalist of the Year by the Times Mirror Corporation. In 2002, she received the National Press Photographers Association Newspaper Photographer of the Year award for the first time. In mid-2003, Cole went to Liberia, as rebels surrounded the capital, Monrovia, demanding the resignation of President Charles Taylor. This trip was to earn her the 2004 Pulitzer Prize, &quot;for her cohesive, behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia, with special attention to innocent citizens caught in the conflict.&quot; She won the 2003 George Polk Award for photojournalism.

In 2004, Cole was named both NPPA Newspaper Photographer of the Year for a second time, for her work in both Liberia and Iraq, and the Pictures of the Year International Newspaper Photographer by the University of Missouri&#x27;s Missouri School of Journalism. This made her the first person to win all three of America&#x27;s top photojournalism awards in the same year. During the year, she also spent time in Haiti, witnessing the fall of the regime of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Cole has also received the Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club in both 2003 and 2004, and won two World Press Photo awards in 2004.

In 2007, she won the NPPA Newspaper Photographer of the Year.

==Arrest==
In April 2000, Cole was arrested on felony charges for &quot;throwing deadly missiles&quot; at police during protests in Miami&#x27;s &quot;Little Havana&quot; during the Elián González affair. Cole and the &quot;Times&quot; denied the charges, which were later dropped.

==Pulitzer Prize nomination==
Cole spent time in Kosovo during the 1999 crisis, and in 2001, spent two months in Afghanistan. In 2002, Cole covered the beginnings of the prominent siege of Bethlehem&#x27;s Church of the Nativity, which had been occupied by Palestinian militants. Then, on May 2, she made a last-minute decision to join a group of peace activists who entered the building in solidarity with the Palestinians. Over the nine days that followed, she doubled as a news reporter for the Times, filing several stories. She was the only photojournalist in the building itself. The pictures she took earned her a nomination for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize.

<text>Gipping Rural District was a rural district in the county of East Suffolk, England. It was created in 1934 by the merger of the disbanded Bosmere and Claydon Rural District and the disbanded East Stow Rural District, under a County Review Order. It was named after the River Gipping and administered from Needham Market.

Its area was reduced slightly in 1952 by an expansion of the county borough of Ipswich.

On 1 April 1974 it was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and has since formed part of the District of Mid Suffolk.

The council established its headquarters at a large eighteenth century house called &quot;Hurstlea&quot; at 131 High Street in Needham Market. After the council&#x27;s abolition in 1974 the building passed to the new Mid Suffolk District Council, who built a large extension to the rear which opened in 1982 to serve as its main offices.

<text>The Dylan Thomas Centre is an arts centre located in the Maritime Quarter in Swansea, Wales. It is a Grade II* listed building.

==History==
The building was commissioned to replace a previous guildhall which had been located near Swansea Castle and dated back to the late 16th century. The new building, which was designed by John Collingwood in the neo-classical style and built by Thomas Bowen, was completed in 1829. It was remodelled to the plans of Thomas Taylor in 1852, using a design which was modelled on the Temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome. The external design involved nine bays on each side with round-arched windows on the ground floor and tall round-arched windows flanked by Corinthian order columns on the first floor.

It was converted for use as a juvenile employment centre after the civic leaders moved to the new Swansea Guildhall in 1934. During the Second World War it was requisitioned by the army for use as a recruiting centre. After reverting to use as a juvenile employment centre, it became a College of Further Education in 1960 and then became an annexe to Dynevor School in 1970 before closing in 1982.

The building was officially re-opened by the American former President Jimmy Carter and the last Leader of the Swansea City Council, Trevor Burtonshaw, as the Dylan Thomas Centre in 1995. In 2012 a large part of the Centre was leased by Swansea&#x27;s council to the University of Wales with the purpose of using it as a business centre for creative industries.

In October 2014, the Centre launched the permanent &quot;Love the Words&quot; exhibition which explores Dylan&#x27;s life and work through a variety of media and including letters, books, worksheets and photographs. It was made possible with support of nearly £1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The Dylan Thomas Centre is home to a year-round programme of literary events, including book launches, plays, poetry evenings, changing exhibitions and science talks. It also hosts the annual Dylan Thomas Festival held between Dylan’s birth and death dates, 27 October to 9 November.

<text>Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool (also known as Affies), is a public Afrikaans medium high school for boys situated in the suburb of Elandspoort in Pretoria in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The school was founded in 1920 by Jan Joubert and reverend Chris Neethling.
==History==
===Early years (1920-1928)===
The school&#x27;s founding on 28 January 1920 marked the establishment of the first purely Afrikaans-medium high school in South Africa. The event predated the official recognition of the Afrikaans language by five years. With English as well as Dutch established as the official languages in South Africa, many of the Afrikaans-speaking population believed Afrikaans should also enjoy recognition. Afrikaans as language grew so fast that CJ Langenhoven tabled a motion in the Cape Provincial Council to slowly replace Dutch with Afrikaans. This thought was strongly supported by MP Jan Joubert and Chris Neethling. As leaders in the community they quickly organized a group to establish a purely Afrikaans school in Pretoria.

On 27 January 1920, the first acting head, Johannes Arnoldus Kruger de Lange received the new pupils. The first enrollment was a boy named Frederik Botha. There were 35 pupils in form II (grade 9) and 10 in form III (grade 10); 45 in total. De Lange was supported by DJ (Dawie) Malan and MM de Vos who were joined on 11 February by HCP Sack. De Lange later became head at the Commercial Branch at the Pretoria Technical College.

The school with 45 children and 3 teachers was housed in the home of General Piet Joubert at 218 Visagie Street, Central Pretoria.

===Current building (1927)===
By 1927, the school had grown and new premises were required. The school was therefore moved eastward to the current premises of the Afrikaanse Hoër Meisieskool, Affies sister-school. At the end of 1927, the school took over the Hogere Oosteindschool, a Dutch-medium instruction school, suggestive of the demise of Dutch as a language in South Africa and the assumption of Afrikaans as the primary instruction medium.

===Present (1928-)===
By 1929 this building had also run out of space and the decision was made to split the boys and girls into separate schools, thus creating the first separate Afrikaans boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools in South Africa. These two schools are now situated opposite each other in Lynnwood Road.

<doc id="839967" wikidata="Q1108172" url="?curid=839967" title="Coles Supermarkets">
<text>Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty. Ltd., doing business as Coles, is an Australian supermarket, retail and consumer services chain, headquartered in Melbourne as part of Coles Group. Founded in 1914 in the suburb of Collingwood by Sir George Coles, the company currently operates 846 supermarkets throughout Australia, including several now-re-branded Bi-Lo stores. Coles has over 120,000 employees and accounts for around 27 per cent of the Australian market.

Coles Online is the company&#x27;s online shopping (&#x27;click &amp; collect&#x27; and home delivery) service.

Between 1986 and 2006, Coles Supermarkets was a brand of Coles Myer, later Coles Group, prior to Wesfarmers purchasing Coles Group in 2007. It became a subsidiary of Coles Group again after Wesfarmers spun off the business in November 2018.

In 2020, Coles changed its slogan to &quot;Value the Australian way&quot;.

==History==
George Coles learned the retail trade working for his father&#x27;s &#x27;Coles Store&#x27; business from 1910 to 1913. (The store continued operating as &quot;The Original Coles&quot; at Wilmot, Tasmania until it was destroyed by a fire on 24 January 2014.) Coles itself was founded when George Coles opened the Coles Variety Store on 9 April 1914 on Smith Street in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood. Further expansion occurred and Coles&#x27; interest in food retailing was spurred in 1958 when it acquired 54 John Connell Dickins grocery stores. It then acquired the Beilby&#x27;s chain in South Australia in 1959 and 265 Matthews Thompson grocery stores in New South Wales in 1960.

In 1960, the first supermarket (trading under the Dickins name) was opened in the Melbourne suburb of Balwyn North, at the corner of Burke and Doncaster Roads where a modernised version continues to operate. By 1973, Coles had established stores in all Australian capital cities. From 1962, its supermarkets were branded &quot;Coles New World&quot; with accompanying Space Age-themed imagery. In 1991, the stores were rebranded &quot;Coles Supermarkets&quot; and from 1998, simply as &quot;Coles&quot;.

In 2004, the liquor division office (Coles Liquor Group), was moved from Chullora in Sydney to the company head office in Hawthorn East, Melbourne. With Coles Myer CEO John Fletcher citing the move for better efficiency between the food and liquor departments. It also resulted in Craig Watkins (35-year veteran and director of Coles Liquor) retiring from the company.

From mid 2006, many Bi-Lo supermarkets were badged as Coles Supermarkets. Newmart supermarkets, under which Bi-Lo traded in Western Australia, were badged as Coles Supermarkets in 2002–2003. Newmart stores co-located with Coles in the same area or shopping centre were sold to Foodland and re-branded as the now-defunct Action Supermarkets chain. The conversion program was put on hold at Easter 2007. In July 2007, Wesfarmers agreed terms to purchase Coles Group for $22 billion. The purchase was completed in early 2008.

In August 2007, as Wesfarmers foreshadowed its plans for the restructuring of Coles Group following its anticipated takeover, it stated that one of three planned divisions would comprise supermarkets, liquor and convenience stores.

From 2008 to 2014, Coles was run by UK retailer Ian McLeod.

In February 2011, Coles acquired National Australia Bank&#x27;s 50 per cent interest in Australia&#x27;s largest loyalty program Flybuys, giving it 100% ownership. In September 2011, Coles commenced stocking private-label clothing in its stores with several stores receiving refits to accommodate the range.

In 2018 Wesfarmers announced its intention to demerge the Coles business, seeking to retain only a 20% interest going forward. In 2018, Steven Cain was appointed as CEO of the Coles Supermarket brand as part of the demerger of Coles from Wesfarmers.

Coles deployed its first electric truck in April 2022. The first fully electric delivery vans followed in August 2023.

In April 2023, Coles opened its first Witron-powered automated distribution centre in Redbank, Queensland. In the second half of 2024, two highly-automated customer fulfilment centres powered by Ocado technology were opened in Truganina, Victoria and Wetherill Park, New South Wales. A second Witron distribution centre was opened in Kemps Creek, New South Wales in August 2024, and construction of a third in Truganina was announced in October 2024. In the same month, Coles deployed their fully electric prime mover truck.

==Advertising and branding==


Coles&#x27; original slogan was &quot;nothing over 2/6&quot;, when it was primarily operating variety stores. The slogan &quot;You&#x27;ll find the best value is at Coles New World&quot; was used in the 1980s. The red/orange orb was used from 1991 to 2005, although store signs continued to use the orb up until the early 2010s. &quot;Serving you better&quot; was used as a slogan from 1998 to 2003, replaced by &quot;save everyday&quot;, endorsed by actress Lisa McCune. A circled tick was used as a logo device from 2003 to 2007, replacing the orb as a primary device in 2005. &quot;Save everyday&quot; was later changed to the grammatically correct &quot;save every day&quot;.

In 2007, the slogan and circle tick were discontinued with simply the Coles name used in preparation for a new red ball logo to match proposed Coles Group livery, which was shelved later in the year as the business was sold. A number of tag lines were employed in the next few years: &quot;Something better every day&quot;, &quot;Proudly Australian since 1914&quot; (introduced with its TV sponsorship of the 2008 Summer Olympics), &quot;Cutting the cost of your shopping&quot;, &quot;Quality food costs less at Coles&quot; and &quot;It all counts&quot;. The slogan &quot;Good things are happening at Coles&quot; was rolled out in 2018, and its current slogan &quot;Value the Australian way&quot; was employed in 2020.

In the 1960s, Coles sponsored a general knowledge quiz show, &quot;Coles £3000 Question&quot; (later &quot;Coles $6000 Question&quot; and &quot;Coles $7000 Question&quot;) which aired on Channel 7.

In 2010, Coles launched a new sub-slogan, &quot;Down Down, Prices Are Down&quot;, featuring a large red cartoon hand pointing downwards to symbolise the chain&#x27;s low-price policy. The slogan incorporated the tune of &quot;Down Down&quot;, a 1975 hit by British rockers Status Quo.
In 2011, the campaign was revised to the fit the tune of Petula Clark&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;Downtown&quot;. but reverted to &quot;Down Down&quot; later in the year.
In 2012, it used Status Quo, which originally recorded the song in 1975, singing and speaking in the newest ad in the series. In February 2016, Coles updated the &quot;Down Down&quot; campaign again, to the tune of &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s a Down Down&quot;). In May 2017 the &quot;Down Down&quot; campaign was again refreshed with &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and reality-TV contestant Casey Donovan with a new disco version of the advertisement. This was ultimately dropped in March 2018, with Coles commercials (mostly on its in-store radio known as Coles Radio) using &quot;Best of My Love&quot; by The Emotions, a hit disco song from 1977, instead.

==Radio==
Coles Radio is the brand name for the in-store radio station heard across all Coles&#x27; supermarkets. It is owned and operated in partnership with broadcaster Nova Entertainment and adopts a hot adult contemporary format, featuring a playlist consisting of pop hits from the 1980s, &#x27;90s, 2000s and current hits. The station has one announcer, Meg Alexander, throughout the workday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The station is also available outside stores via Coles&#x27; website, the Nova Player app and on DAB+ digital radio, making it accessible in many newer car models.

==Internet retailing==
==Accusations of anti-competitive practices==
Coles has been accused by suppliers of using heavy-handed tactics when dealing with its suppliers. A 2004 investigation by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission did not result in any action being brought against Coles and Woolworths. A 2012 investigation in which suppliers were offered anonymity is believed to have uncovered unethical practices. In 2013, the ACCC was investigating both Coles and Woolworths over accusations that they used improper market practices to force down prices from suppliers. These accusations further intensified on a February 2024 episode of news program &quot;Four Corners&quot;, which exposed accusations of price gouging between both Coles and Woolworths Supermarkets, which form an alleged duopoly colloquially known as Colesworth.

==Price gouging and supplier swindling==

Coles and Woolworths, the two largest supermarket chains in Australia responsible for controlling over two thirds of the market share, have recently come under fire on accusations of price gouging. They have also been accused of allegedly forcing suppliers to increase their supplies in order to buy goods at lower prices, during a time which the economy is at the brink of entering a recession and people are facing a cost of living crisis. In a Senate Inquiry, Greens Senator Nick McKim, the chair of the committee, highlighted that the actions of Coles and Woolworths resulted in serious harm to the people of Australia, off the profiteering these supermarket chains have done manipulating food prices. One of the key recommendations that was made in this enquiry is to ensure that price gouging will be made illegal.

==Legal cases==
A 2014 Federal Court of Australia case ruled that Coles &quot;threatened harm to suppliers if they didn&#x27;t meet their demands,&quot; and ordered the chain to pay $10 million in penalties.

In 2015, the Federal Court of Australia fined Coles $2.5 million for making misleading claims in relation to the sale of its par-baked bread products.

In September 2024, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission brought legal action against Coles, accusing the supermarket of misleading customers on discounts through their Down Down promotions.

== Notable promotions ==

*4-cents-per-litre fuel offer: When a customer spends $30 or more in a single transaction at a Coles, Bi-Lo, Pick&#x27;n&#x27;Pay or Liquorland, they receive a four-cent discount coupon on their receipt or flybuys account for use at Coles Express service stations. This practice has been criticised by competition law experts who argue that people pay higher petrol and grocery prices to fund these discounts.

*Shoppers can collect flybuys loyalty program points at Coles Group businesses.
*Between 1991 and 1993, Coles Supermarkets ran a promotion in conjunction with Apple Inc. and 12 major suppliers entitled &quot;Apples for Students&quot;, where students collected grocery dockets and returned them to their participating school, and once a certain value had been reached the school would be provided with a free Macintosh computer. Seventy per cent of Australia&#x27;s schools and kindergartens participated and gained more than 25,000 computers, equipment and software worth $13.6 million.
*In 2010, Coles Supermarkets ran a similar program called &quot;Sports for Schools&quot; which customers collected coupons to hand in to their school in exchange for sports equipment. The program was run again in 2011, 2012, 2018 and 2020.
*In 2018, Coles ran a collectibles promotion called Little Shop featuring mini-sized grocery items. Competitor Woolworths stated the success of the promotion led to reduced customer visits to its stores. Due to the success of the campaign, Coles re-invigorated the promotion with the collectables returning for the Christmas period.
*Coles actively supported the Yes case for the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum.

==Private label brands==
Coles has several generic or private label brands:

*Coles: A mid-price line, replacing the &#x27;You&#x27;ll love Coles&#x27; brand. Designed to match established branded products.
*Coles Simply: A value brand
*Coles Finest: A premium brand launched in 2006, with a small range of gourmet foods. Promoted as of greater quality than many well-known branded products and often more expensive.
*Coles Green Choice: A range of household products which claim to be environmentally responsible, with a donation being made to Clean Up Australia with every one of its products sold.
*Coles Organic: A range of products grown and processed without the use of synthetic chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides, approved by official certified organisations.
* Coles Ultra: A range of higher-end cleaning products above the smart buy range.
In the past Coles had a variety of private labels including Smart Buy, Simply Less, Simply Gluten Free, Savings, Mix, Farmland and Embassy.

<doc id="839968" wikidata="Q256794" url="?curid=839968" title="Thai six-hour clock">
<text>The six-hour clock is a traditional timekeeping system used in the Thai and formerly the Lao language and the Khmer language, alongside the official 24-hour clock. Like other common systems, it counts twenty-four hours in a day, but it divides the day into four quarters, counting six hours in each. The hours in each quarter (with the exception of the sixth hour in each quarter) are told with period-designating words or phrases, which are:

*... &quot;mong chao&quot; (, ) for the first half of daytime (07:00 to 12:59)
*&quot;Bai&quot; ... &quot;mong&quot; (, ) for the second half of daytime (13:00 to 18:59)
*... &quot;thum&quot; (, ) for the first half of nighttime (19:00 to 00:59)
*&quot;Ti&quot; ... (, ) for the second half of nighttime (01:00 to 06:59)

These terms are thought to have originated from the sounds of traditional timekeeping devices. The gong was used to announce the hours in daytime, and the drum at night. Hence the terms &quot;mong&quot;, an onomatopoeia of the sound of the gong, and &quot;thum&quot;, that of the sound of the drum. &quot;Ti&quot; is a verb meaning &quot;to hit or strike&quot;, and is presumed to have originated from the act of striking the timekeeping device itself. &quot;Chao&quot; and &quot;bai&quot; translate as &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;afternoon&quot; respectively, and help to differentiate the two daytime quarters.

The sixth hours of each quarter are told by a different set of terms. The sixth hour at dawn is called &quot;yam rung&quot; (, ), and the sixth hour at dusk is called &quot;yam kham&quot; (, ), both references to the act of striking the gong or drum in succession to announce the turning of day (&quot;yam&quot;), where &quot;rung&quot; and &quot;kham&quot;, meaning &quot;dawn&quot; and &quot;dusk&quot;, denote the time of these occurrences. The midday and midnight hours are respectively known as &quot;thiang&quot; (, , or &quot;thiang wan&quot;, , ) and &quot;thiang khuen&quot; (, ), both of which literally translate as &quot;midday&quot; and &quot;midnight&quot;.

Midnight is also called &quot;song yam&quot; (, ; note that &quot;yam&quot; is a different word), a reference to the end of the second three-hour period of the night watch (&quot;song&quot; translates as the number &quot;two&quot;). In addition, &quot;hok (6) thum&quot; and &quot;ti hok&quot; may also be used to refer to the hours of midnight and dawn, following general usage for the other hours, although more rarely; and the fourth to sixth hours of the second daytime half may also be told as ...&quot;mong yen&quot; (, ), &quot;yen&quot; meaning &quot;evening&quot;.

The system has been used in some form since the days of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, but was codified similarly to its present form only in 1901 by King Chulalongkorn in &quot;Royal Gazette&quot; 17:206. Nowadays, it is used only in colloquial speech. However, a corrupted form of the six-hour clock is more frequently encountered, where usually the first half of daytime (including the sixth hour of the preceding quarter) is counted as in the twelve-hour clock, i.e. &quot;hok (6) mong chao&quot;, &quot;chet (7) mong&quot;, etc., up to &quot;sip et (11) mong&quot;.

The six-hour clock system was abolished in Laos and Cambodia during the French protectorate, and the French 24-hour clock system (for example, 3h00) has been used since.

<doc id="839970" wikidata="Q927367" url="?curid=839970" title="Chestnut-collared longspur">
<text>The chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus) is a species of bird in the family Calcariidae. Like the other longspurs, it is a small ground-feeding bird that primarily eats seeds. It breeds in prairie habitats in Canada and the northern United States and winters to the south in the United States and Mexico.

== Description ==
These birds have a short conical bill, a streaked back and a white tail with a dark tip. In breeding plumage, the male has black underparts, a chestnut nape, a yellow throat and a black crown. Other birds have light brown underparts, a dark crown, brown wings and may have some chestnut on the nape.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.1–6.5 in (13–16.5 cm)
* Weight: 0.6–0.8 oz (17–23 g)
* Wingspan: 25–27 cm

== Distribution and status ==
This bird breeds in short and mixed grass prairies in central Canada and the north central United States. In winter, they migrate in flocks to prairies and open fields in the southern United States and Mexico. Like other prairie birds, they have disappeared from some areas because of habitat loss but are still fairly common.

Controlled burns may benefit this species as they feed on low-growing plants that are more easily spotted after a fire.

== Behavior ==
These birds forage on the ground, gathering in flocks in winter. They mainly eat seeds, also eating insects in summer. Young birds are mainly fed insects.

The female lays 4 or 5 eggs in a grass cup nest in a shallow scrape on the ground. The male sings and flies up to defend his territory. Both parents feed the young birds.

The call is a two-syllabled &quot;chee dee&quot;.

<text>Vasyl Olexandrovych Sukhomlynsky (; in transliteration from Ukrainian: Vasyl Oleksandrovych Sukhomlynsky) (September 28, 1918 – September 2, 1970) was a Ukrainian humanistic educator in the Soviet Union who saw the aim of education in producing a truly humane being.

== Biography ==

Sukhomlynsky was born in a peasant family in the village of Omelnyk, Vasyliv volost of Oleksandriia uezd (today Oleksandriia Raion of Kirovohrad Oblast in Ukraine). In 1933 he finished a seven-year school of primary education after which his mother escorted him to Kremenchuk where he enrolled into a local medical college (tekhnikum). However, he quit the medical school and enrolled into &quot;Robitfak&quot; which he finished in short term. In 1935 he started to work as a teacher not far from his native village. In 1938 Sukhomlynsky enrolled into the Poltava Pedagogical Institute out of which he graduated the same year. Upon graduation, he returned to native lands where he worked as a teacher of the Ukrainian language and literature in the Onufriivka middle school. There he got married. During World War II he volunteered to the front-lines in 1941 and as a &quot;junior politruk&quot; was severely wounded in January 1942 during the defense of Moscow. He was transferred to a military hospital in the Ural Mountains where he continued his medical treatment. During that time he continuously requested his return to the front-lines while the medical commission could not recognize him even conditionally available for that. He was appointed a principal of a middle school in the town of Uva (Republic of Udmurtia). After the de-occupation of Ukraine from the Nazis, in 1944 he returned to his native land. Vasyl learned that his wife and young son had been tortured by the Gestapo. He was appointed as a director of the Regional People&#x27;s Education (RAINO). In 1948, he became principal of the Pavlysh Secondary School in the settlement of Pavlysh (upon his own request) – a post he held to the end of his life.

== Educational philosophy ==
The core of Sukhomlynsky&#x27;s system of education was his approach to moral education, which involved sensitising his students to beauty in nature, in art and in human relations, and encouraging students to take responsibility for the living environment which surrounded them.

Sukhomlynsky taught his students that the most precious thing in life is a human being and that there is no greater honor than to bring joy to other people. He taught them that to bring joy to other people, and especially to their families, they should strive to create beauty in themselves and in the environment. There was thus a very close connection between moral and aesthetic education in Sukhomlynsky&#x27;s approach.

Another aspect of being truly human was the development of the intellect, so that the horizons of the mind grew ever wider, gradually encompassing the whole world and reaching into the depths of space. Sukhomlynsky could not agree with those who sought to give education a purely utilitarian focus, who thought that knowledge was worthwhile only if it found direct application in the workplace. For him, the study of foreign languages and of astronomy were essential in order for a person to appreciate the world of which they were a part, and to broaden their minds.

The foundation of all personal growth is health, and Sukhomlynsky gave a great deal of his attention to ensuring that children enjoyed optimum health, especially in early childhood, when character is formed. He took children out into nature often, combining physical exercise with lessons in thought and in the appreciation of beauty. Especially in the primary school, he thought it important that children&#x27;s thought be associated with vivid images, such as were to be found in the fields, forests and waterways within walking distance of the school. If thought were divorced from the children&#x27;s direct experiences, it would exhaust them.

It was also important that children&#x27;s learning, the work of their intellects, be associated with practical works which put their knowledge to use. Only if children&#x27;s knowledge was used to improve their environment and the lives of people around them, would it lead to the formation of an active philosophy of life, to a practical moral stance.

Sukhomlynsky&#x27;s holistic educational philosophy thus rested on five pillars: health education, moral education, aesthetic education, intellectual education, and work education.

==Educating the heart==

Sukhomlynsky sought to prolong children&#x27;s childhood, to keep them optimistic and open to the world, to preserve the freshness of their emotional responses to the world. He showed them that although they were small, they could do a lot to care for the environment in which they lived and to bring happiness to the people they met. He sought to refine their sense of beauty, being very selective in the impressions he fed to their young minds. He took them to the most beautiful natural settings he could find. He taught them to listen to the music of nature, the rustle of grasses and of leaves, the song of the lark. He played them music inspired by such natural sounds, and showed them paintings of natural beauty. He did not swamp them with a surfeit of images and sounds, but allowed each new exposure to beauty to be memorable.

He taught them to become more aware of the inner world of other people, to read others&#x27; eyes, to recognize feelings of joy, of sorrow or confusion. He tried to ensure that children took joy home from school to their families, to ensure that every child uncovered some latent talent or ability at which they could excel. Not every child could excel academically, but each could shine at something and find a way to bring joy to others. This was the foundation of their self-respect and their moral development.

For his achievements in the field of education, Sukhomlynsky was bestowed the title of Hero of Socialist Labor in 1968. He was also a recipient of two Orders of Lenin, Order of the Red Star, Ushinsky and Makarenko Medals.

In 1969 Sukhomlynsky wrote the book Серце віддаю дітям Серце віддаю дітям|&quot;Серце віддаю дітям&quot;}}, (); English translations: &quot;To Children I Give My Heart&quot;, by Holly Martin Smith, 1982, and &quot;My Heart I Give to Children&quot;, by Alan Leslie Cockerill, 2016, . For this book he was awarded the State Prize of the Ukrainian SSR in 1974 (posthumously).

<text>Louise Jane Wener (born 30 July 1966) is an English writer, singer, songwriter and guitarist of the band Sleeper. 

==Life==
Born in Gants Hill, London, Wener is the younger daughter of Donald Wener, an Inland Revenue tax inspector from East Ham who had served in the RAF, and Audrey (&quot;née&quot; Dixon), a bank clerk and former nurse. Her elder sister was the writer Sue Margolis. Their brother Geoff managed Sleeper after attending Cambridge University.

Wener attended Manchester University, where she met Jon Stewart, which led to the formation of Sleeper. 

Sleeper recorded three full-length albums prior to splitting: &quot;Smart&quot;, &quot;The It Girl&quot; and &quot;Pleased to Meet You&quot;. After the band split up in 1998, Wener began a writing career, and has written four novels: &quot;Goodnight Steve McQueen&quot;, &quot;The Big Blind&quot; (also known as &quot;The Perfect Play&quot;), &quot;The Half Life of Stars&quot;, and &quot;Worldwide Adventures In Love&quot;. Her autobiography, &quot;Different for Girls: My True-life Adventures in Pop&quot; (also known as &quot;Just For One Day: Adventures in Britpop&quot;), was published in June 2010. Wener co-wrote a BBC Radio 4 drama series, &quot;Queens of Noise&quot;, with Roy Boulter of The Farm. It ran for two five-programme series in the 10.45 AM &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; drama slot, focusing on the rise of a fictional indie band, Velveteens.

In addition to writing herself, Wener has taught novel-writing. With her partner, Sleeper drummer Andy Maclure, she formed another band, Huge Advance, although they only played in and around their residential suburb of Crouch End. By 2011, she and Maclure had married and moved to Brighton, where Maclure teaches at a music college. They have a son and a daughter. Wener has written an article about motherhood for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Sleeper reformed in 2017 to play in four British cities in July and August as part of the Star Shaped Festival. They went on to headline an eleven-date tour in 2018. The band have since recorded two new albums: &quot;The Modern Age&quot;, released in March 2019, and&quot; This Time Tomorrow&quot;, released in December 2020.

In 2021, Wener teamed up with the Greater Manchester indie band The Lottery Winners to record &quot;Bad Things&quot;, an R&amp;B-laced indie-pop track from the Leigh band&#x27;s eight-track EP &quot;Start Again&quot; (with &quot;Bad Things&quot; being credited to The Lottery Winners featuring Sleeper, rather than featuring Louise Wener).

<text>The Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) at Edith Cowan University (ECU) is a performing arts school in Perth, Western Australia. Established in 1980, it is notable for being the most comprehensive performing arts school in Australia by disciplines of study and has produced some of Australia&#x27;s most prominent graduates in the field.

It is scheduled to re-locate to the currently under-construction Perth CBD campus following completion in late 2025. The ECU City campus, which is designed by Lyons and will be located in Yagan Square, is planned to have six performance venues which are projected to have 300 performances annually. The campus will be accessible by public transport, being built on top of the underground Perth Busport opposite the Perth railway station.

As of 2019, the executive dean of the school is Prof David Shirley . Prior to being assigned, he was the director of the Manchester School of Theatre and chair of the Federation of Drama Schools in the United Kingdom.

==Courses==
It offers study and research programs in acting, screen performance, arts and cultural management, dance (classical ballet and contemporary dance), music (in various fields of instrumental and voice performance, composition and school teacher education), theatre (including directing and musical theatre), production (including production design, costume design, lighting, props and scenery, sound and stage management) and other fields of performing arts.

It also offers a vocational program in Aboriginal performance and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) research program with an integrated &quot;performance, exhibition, event or an embodiment of some form&quot;. Broadcasting is now taught in the School of Communications and Arts of ECU. Originally an initiative of the state government, the Academy receives funding from both the State and Commonwealth governments.

==Public performances==
The performing arts school showcases a large number of performances across all fields annually that are open to the public. This events are mostly held at WAAPA&#x27;s own theatres and facilities in Mount Lawley. Performances and events are also held at various external venues such as the Rosemount Hotel, Government House Ballroom, Ellington Jazz Club, Luna Cinema, Subiaco Arts Centre, Studio Underground, Blue Room Theatre and the Albany Entertainment Centre.

Four more purpose built dance/rehearsal studio spaces were created: A recording studio, electronics studio, and four production workshops for design and costume making were also added to the existing workshops and behind the scenes production facilities.

Twelve large rehearsal and dance studios, numerous music and ensemble studios, a specialised visual and performing arts library collection, and numerous exhibition spaces.

Fully equipped broadcasting facilities and studios for television and radio. An environment has been created where broadcasting students can gain first hand experience of working within a media environment.

Academic teaching appointments are made on the basis of qualifications, recent professional experience, industry profile, and reputation. WAAPA invites international professionals to Perth as artists in residence to work with students on productions and performances and to provide performance and professional advice through workshops.

<text>The Leonardo AW609, formerly the AgustaWestland AW609, and originally the Bell-Agusta BA609, is a twin-engined tiltrotor VTOL aircraft with an overall configuration similar to that of the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey. It is capable of landing vertically like a helicopter while having a range and speed in excess of conventional rotorcraft. The AW609 is aimed at the civil aviation market, in particular VIP customers and offshore oil and gas operators. It has progressed from a concept in the late 1990s, to development and testing, and is working towards certification in the 2020s. 

==Development==

===Origins and program changes===
The BA609 drew on experience gained from Bell&#x27;s earlier experimental tiltrotor, the XV-15. In 1996, Bell and Boeing formed a partnership to develop a civil tiltrotor aircraft. In March 1998, Boeing pulled out of the project. In September 1998, Agusta became a partner in the development program. This led to the establishment of the Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company (BAAC), a joint venture between Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland, to develop and manufacture the aircraft, which was named Bell-Agusta AB-609; the two companies simultaneously worked on a conventional medium helicopter project (the Agusta-Bell AB139). 

The Italian government subsidized Agusta&#x27;s development of a military tiltrotor, and as the AW609 has civilian aspects, the European Commission requires AgustaWestland to pay back progressive amounts per aircraft to the Italian state to avoid a distortion of competition. , Bell continues to perform contract work on the AW609 program, while considering commercial potential for the bigger V-280 tiltrotor, where military production may reach larger numbers and hence reduce unit cost. In 2016, Bell preferred the 609 for commercial applications and kept the V-280 for military use only. Bell stated that conventional helicopters were not part of Bell&#x27;s future for military customers.

The aircraft&#x27;s purpose is to take off and land vertically, but fly faster than a helicopter. Over 45 different aircraft have flown proving VTOL and STOL capabilities, of which the V-22, Harrier &quot;jump jet&quot; family, Yakovlev Yak-38 and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II jets have proceeded to production. By 2008, Bell had estimated that very light jets and large offshore helicopters like the Sikorsky S-92 had reduced the potential market for tiltrotors. Also in 2008, it was reported that limited funding of the program by both Bell and AgustaWestland had resulted in slow flight testing progress.

In September 2009, AgustaWestland chief executive Giuseppe Orsi said that corporate parent Finmeccanica had authorised buying Bell Helicopter out of the program to speed it up, as Bell was dissatisfied with the commercial prospects and wanted to spend the resources on other programs. In 2013 AgustaWestland estimated a market of 700 aircraft over 20 years. By 2011, negotiations centred on the full transfer of technologies shared with the V-22, however Bell stated that no technology was shared with the V-22. At the 2011 Paris Air Show, AgustaWestland stated that it will assume full ownership of the programme, redesignating the aircraft as &quot;AW609&quot;, and that Bell Helicopter will remain in the role of component design and certification. In November 2011, the exchange of ownership was completed, following the granting of regulatory approval - media estimated that the transfer happened at little cost.

===Testing===
On 6 December 2002, the first ground tests of the BA609 prototype began. The first flight took place on 7 March 2003 in Arlington, Texas, flown by test pilots Roy Hopkins and Dwayne Williams. After 14 hours of helicopter-mode flight testing, the prototype was moved to a ground testing rig to study the operational effects of the conversion modes. Following the completion of ground-based testing, on 3 June 2005 the prototype resumed flight testing, focusing on the expansion of its flight envelope. On 22 July 2005, the first conversion from helicopter to aeroplane mode while in flight took place. 
By October 2008, 365 flight-hours had been logged by two prototype aircraft. The AW609 demonstrated a safe dual-engine failure in normal cruise flight on 15 May 2009. By February 2012, this had risen to 650 hours, and it was reported that 85 per cent of the AW609&#x27;s flight envelope had been explored. Test pilot Paul Edwards has stated that the AW609 was not susceptible to the vortex ring state phenomena, naturally slipping out of the vortex on its own since both rotors will not simultaneously enter the vortex ring state.

In 2011, AgustaWestland began construction of a third prototype. That prototype was still not fully assembled by February 2015. The company plans to conduct test flights in Italy in the summer of 2015. AgustaWestland planned to then disassemble it and ship it to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to prepare it for tests of the de-icing system in Minnesota. A fourth prototype, to be used in the development and testing of new avionics and control systems, was also underway. By November 2012, over 700 flight hours had been accumulated by the two operational prototypes. In January 2014, it was reported that in excess of 850 flying hours had been accumulated by the two prototypes. Accumulated flight data is used to further develop representative simulators, which are in turn being used to support the development program.

By March 2015, the two prototype aircraft had accumulated 1,200 hours, of about 2,000 hours necessary for certification. Two more aircraft were expected to fly that year. Flight test maximums had progressed to a weight of , a speed of , and altitude. In 2015, AgustaWestland reported that the AW609 flew from Yeovil, UK, to Milan, Italy, in 2 hours 18 minutes. In September 2015, the first AW609 prototype was reportedly nearing the end of its service life, while a third prototype was finishing construction at the company&#x27;s Vergiate facility and a fourth prototype was being built in Philadelphia.

On 30 October 2015, the second of the two prototypes (N609AG) crashed near AgustaWestland&#x27;s Vergiate facility in north west Italy, killing both pilots.

===Certification===
In 2002, Type certification of the aircraft was projected for 2007. In 2007, certification was projected for 2011. In August 2012, the aircraft was forecast to receive Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification in early 2016. The company expected to achieve FAA certification in 2017. Some delays were caused by lack of funding for the FAA, others by the V-22 troubles, while AgustaWestland also spent time increasing performance and reducing cost.

In 2012, the FAA stated that the AW609 was to be certified in compliance with both helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft rules. New codes were to be developed to cover the transition phase between the two modes. Of the 217 Pilot Training Tasks, 10 are unique tiltrotor tasks. AW609 Certification Basis is established by the FAA under the provisions of Part 21.17(b) for &quot;Special Class Aircraft&quot; along with a portion of Part 25 (fixed-wing aircraft) and 29 (helicopter) and new specific tiltrotor parts in a new category called &quot;powered lift&quot;. In January 2013, the FAA defined US tiltrotor noise rules to comply with ICAO rules, expecting the AW609 to be available within 10 years. Noise certification will cost $588,000, which is the same as for a large helicopter.

In February 2014, the AW609 conducted its first customer demonstration flights, in both airplane and helicopter modes, and began certification flights.

In early summer 2014, the AW609 performed FAA-monitored autorotation tests. More than 79 power-off conversions from airplane mode to helicopter mode were made across 10 flight hours. During these tests, it was found that the minimum operating requirements for successful autorotation include the altitude being , and that the system keeps rotor rpm above the minimum 70% for stable recovery. The test pilots received the Iven C. Kincheloe Award for their role in the tests.

In February 2023, pilots from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flew the AW609 tiltrotor, representing the first time the regulator&#x27;s pilots had flown the type. The Leonardo company described the flight as a pre-TIA (type inspection authorization) activity, as it moves towards the final stage of the certification process. EASA pilots subsequently commenced familarisation flights in March 2023 with certification and entry into service projected to be sometime in 2024.

===Further developments===

At the Farnborough Air Show in July 2012, AgustaWestland announced a higher-weight variant of the AW609, up to . This model would trade some of its vertical takeoff performance for increased payload capacity. Officials from AgustaWestland have suggested that this short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant may be an attractive option for search and rescue and maritime operators. According to senior vice-president of marketing Roberto Garavaglia, the Italian government is interested in acquiring several AW609s for coastal patrol duties. Due to an agreement with Bell, these may not feature armament.

In June 2013, AgustaWestland announced that work to integrate design changes as part of a major modernisation would delay the AW609&#x27;s certification by up to one year. These design changes primarily involved aerodynamic improvements, aimed at achieving a 10% reduction in drag and a significant reduction in overall weight, increasing the AW609&#x27;s performance and capabilities. Separate improvement programs were underway on the aircraft&#x27;s engines and avionics systems. In 2015, AgustaWestland announced the development of external fuel tanks which would permit flights carrying six passengers over three hours. 

In 2013, AgustaWestland was considering a US-based final assembly point for production AW609s. Managing director Robert LaBelle stated that 35% of the customers for the tiltrotor are expected to come from the US market. Reportedly, the primary production line was to be located in Italy while a second production line in the US was under consideration. In 2015 AgustaWestland announced that the AW609 will be produced at its Philadelphia facility, the production site for the AW139, AW119 KXe and AW169. Two to three AW609 aircraft will be assembled there beginning in 2017, and once production matures, a second final assembly line is being considered for Italy. Leonardo has a flight simulator in Philadelphia to assist pilot training in the peculiarities of flying a tiltrotor.

In 2015, Bristow Helicopters and AgustaWestland agreed to develop dedicated offshore oil and gas transport, and search and rescue configurations for the AW609. In March 2015, Bristow Group signed a joint development agreement with AgustaWestland at Heli-Expo, which would allow Bristow to exclusively direct the direction of the tiltrotor for offshore missions such as oil and gas operations. The changes could extend beyond the AW609 to potentially affect the design of larger and more advanced models that AgustaWestland was planning to introduce in the early 2020s. The introduction of tiltrotors would allow for point-to-point operations, flying oil company personnel to platforms from major population centers with a greater margin of safety. Industry journalists viewed the agreement as an approval of the tiltrotor technology from the commercial industry, where previously only the military were interested.

In the early 2020s there was interest in a military version; an AW609 for utility, medevac, or search and rescue versions began to be discussed more seriously.

==Design==
The AW609 is a tiltrotor aircraft capable of performing vertical landings whereas conventional fixed-wing aircraft cannot, allowing the type to serve locations such as heliports or very small airports, while possessing twice the speed and the range of any available helicopter. AgustaWestland promotes the type as &quot;...combining the benefits of a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft into one aircraft&quot;. The AW609 appears to be outwardly similar to the military-orientated V-22 Osprey. However, the two aircraft share few components. Unlike the V-22, the AW609 has a pressurised cabin. 

As of 2013, multiple cabin configurations have been projected, including a standard nine-passenger layout, a six-to-seven-passenger VIP/executive cabin, and a search and rescue model featuring a hoist/basket and four single seats. Medevac and patrol/surveillance-orientated variants have been proposed. For increased passenger comfort, the cabin is pressurised and equipped with soundproofing. Access to the cabin is via a , two-piece clamshell door, center-set into the fuselage underneath the wings.

The AW609 is powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6C-67A turboshaft engines, which each drive a three-bladed proprotor. These engines possess roughly twice the horsepower of the similarly sized AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter. Both of the engine and proprotor pairs are mounted on a load-bearing rotatable pylon at the wing&#x27;s ends, allowing the proprotors to be positioned at various angles. In helicopter mode, the proprotors can be positioned between a 75- and 95-degree angle from the horizontal, with 87 degrees being the typical selection for hovering vertically. In airplane mode, the proprotors are rotated forward and locked in position at a zero-degree angle, spinning at 84% RPM. The flight control software reportedly handles much of the complexity of the transitioning between helicopter and airplane modes. Automated systems guide pilots to the correct tilt angle and air speed settings.
When flying in airplane mode, the majority of lift is produced by the AW609&#x27;s wings, which are slightly forward-swept. Both the wing and the main fuselage are made largely of composite materials. The wings feature flaperon control surfaces which are normally automatically controlled. In vertical flight, the flaperons drop to a 66-degree downwards angle to reduce the wing area being encountered by downwash from the proprotors. A high-mounted rudderless vertical stabiliser is attached the rear of the fuselage to stabilise flight while in aircraft mode. 

In the event of a single engine failure, either engine can provide power to both proprotors via a drive shaft. The AW609 is also capable of autorotation. The AW609 has been designed to achieve Full Transport Category/Class 1 performance, to operate safely even when flown under single engine conditions. It is equipped with a de-icing system, and is to be certified for flying into known icing conditions. Building on experiences with the V-22, the AW609 is outfitted with a sink rate warning system.

Avionics include a triple-redundant digital fly-by-wire flight control system, a head-up display system, and Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC). The cockpit has been designed so that the AW609 can be flown by a single pilot in instrument flight rules conditions. Several of the aircraft&#x27;s controls, such as blade pitch, are designed to resemble and function their counterparts on conventional rotorcraft, enabling helicopter pilots to transition to the type more easily. 

Elements of the aircraft&#x27;s controls feature touchscreen interfaces. Shortly following AgustaWestland&#x27;s full acquisition of the program, a substantial modernisation of the AW609&#x27;s design was initiated in 2012. These changes included new engines and the redesigning of the cockpit. As part of the design refresh, new flight management systems, Northrop Grumman inertial and GPS navigation systems, and other avionics from Rockwell Collins were adopted.

==Sales potential and service entry==

Bell/Agusta aimed the aircraft &quot;at the government and military markets&quot;. Another key market for the AW609 has been offshore oil and gas operations, which require aircraft capable of traversing the increasing distances involved. In 2001, Bell estimated a market for 1,000 aircraft. Bell/Agusta stated in 2007 that they intend for the BA609 to compete with corporate business jets and helicopters, and that the BA609 would be of interest to any operator that has a mixed fleet of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. In 2004, Lt. Gen. Michael Hough, USMC deputy commandant for aviation, requested that Bell conduct studies into arming the BA609, potentially to act as an escort for V-22s. However, AgustaWestland&#x27;s deal with Bell for taking over the BA609 program precludes the aircraft from carrying arms.

In 2001, Terry Stinson, then chairman and CEO of Bell Helicopters, declared that the aircraft will cost &quot;at least &quot;. In 2004, Don Barbour, then executive marketing director, stated that &quot;early orders had been taken at a price of between $8 and $10 million.&quot; Since 1999, orders have been at a price to be confirmed no later than 24 months before aircraft delivery. In 2012, industry reporters estimated that the final price tag may come to $30 million per unit. In 2015, some believed the price to be only around $24 million.

In 1999, there were 77 confirmed orders. In 2012, there were 70 orders, depending on the final unit price. , there were 60 orders for the AW609. The company intends to have production facilities ready for completing orders right after FAA certification.

Bristow Helicopters intends to order 10 or more. Michael Bloomberg, the U.S. billionaire businessman and politician, is &quot;near the top&quot; of the list of buyers who have put a deposit down on the AW609 tiltrotor aircraft. In February 2015, the Italian Army released a white paper documenting its vision of future procurement efforts. It included the intention to procure a force of tiltrotor aircraft for rapid troop-transport and medical evacuation duties. It has been speculated in the media that the AW609 is a likely candidate for the requirement. In November 2015, United Arab Emirates selected a search and rescue variant of the AW609, signing a memorandum of understanding for three, with an option for three more. As of May 2019, no contract with the UAE has been signed.

Currently being built at AWPC Philadelphia, in March 2022, Leonardo projected entry into service as early as 2023. In 2023, the AW609 entered the final stage of flight certification, and it is estimated this process could be completed as early as 2025.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
On 30 October 2015, the second of the two prototypes (N609AG), which first flew in 2006, crashed near AgustaWestland&#x27;s Vergiate facility in North West Italy, killing long-time test pilots Pietro Venanzi and Herb Moran. The aircraft broke up in midair after 27 minutes of flight, on a flight plan that included high speed testing. Investigators consider the most likely cause to be changes in flight control laws and tail changes. These led to a &quot;Dutch roll&quot; instability while diving at where previously only had been achieved. The Italian authorities seized the third prototype in May 2016, and returned it for flight testing in July.

The final report stated that during a high-speed dive with a left turn, &quot;slight lateral-direction oscillations&quot; started on roll-out and grew in amplitude and frequency. The pilot attempted to correct the roll with &quot;counterphase input roll manoeuvres and then pedal inputs&quot;, but this did not dampen the oscillations. They instead became divergent, bringing the sideslip angle at 10.5°, well above the 4° maximum allowed, &quot;inducing contact of the right proprotor with the right wing due to excessive flapping of the proprotor blades&quot;. This severed fuel and hydraulic lines in the wing leading edge, triggering a fire.

<doc id="840023" wikidata="Q453883" url="?curid=840023" title="Chuck Close">
<text>Charles Thomas Close (July 5, 1940 – August 19, 2021) was an American painter, visual artist, and photographer who made massive-scale photorealist and abstract portraits of himself and others. Close also created photo portraits using a very large format camera. He adapted his painting style and working methods in 1988, after being paralyzed by an occlusion of the anterior spinal artery.

==Early life and education==
Chuck Close was born in Monroe, Washington. His father, Leslie Durward Close, died when Chuck was 11 years old. His mother&#x27;s name was Mildred Wagner Close. As a child, Close had a neuromuscular condition that made it difficult to lift his feet and a bout with nephritis that kept him out of school for most of sixth grade. Even when in school, he did poorly due to his dyslexia, which was not diagnosed at the time.

Most of his early works were very large portraits based on photographs, using photorealism or hyperrealism, of family and friends, often other artists. Close said he had prosopagnosia (face blindness), and suggested that this condition is what first inspired him to do portraits.
Author Graham Thompson writes &quot;One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.&quot;

In an interview with Phong Bui in &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;, Close described an early encounter with a Jackson Pollock painting at the Seattle Art Museum: &quot;I went to the Seattle Art Museum with my mother for the first time when I was 14. I saw this Jackson Pollock drip painting with aluminum paint, tar, gravel and all that stuff. I was absolutely outraged, disturbed. It was so far removed from what I thought art was. However, within 2 or 3 days, I was dripping paint all over my old paintings. In a way I&#x27;ve been chasing that experience ever since.&quot;

Close attended Everett Community College in 1958–1960. Local writer John Patric was an early anti-establishment intellectual influence on him, and a role model for the iconoclastic and theatric artist&#x27;s persona Close learned to project in subsequent years.

In 1962, Close received his B.A. from the University of Washington in Seattle. In 1961, he won a coveted scholarship to the Yale Summer School of Music and Art, and the following year entered the graduate degree program at Yale University, where he received his MFA in 1964. Among Close&#x27;s classmates at Yale were Brice Marden, Vija Celmins, Janet Fish, Richard Serra, Nancy Graves, Jennifer Bartlett, Robert Mangold, and Sylvia Plimack Mangold.

After Yale, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna on a Fulbright grant. When he returned to the United States, he worked as an art teacher at the University of Massachusetts. Close moved to New York City in 1967 and established himself in SoHo.

==Work==

===Style===
Throughout his career, Close expanded his contribution to portraiture through the mastery of such varied drawing and painting techniques as ink, graphite, pastel, watercolor, conté crayon, finger painting, and stamp-pad ink on paper; printmaking techniques, such as mezzotint, etching, woodcuts, linocuts, and silkscreens; as well as handmade paper collage, Polaroid photographs, daguerreotypes, and Jacquard tapestries. His early airbrush techniques inspired the development of the ink jet printer.

Close had been known for his skillful brushwork as a graduate student at Yale University. There, he emulated Willem de Kooning and seemed &quot;destined to become a third-generation abstract expressionist, although with a dash of Pop iconoclasm&quot;. After a period in which he experimented with figurative constructions, Close began a series of paintings derived from black-and-white photographs of a female nude, which he copied onto canvas and painted in color. As he explained in a 2009 interview with Cleveland, Ohio&#x27;s &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; newspaper, he made a choice in 1967 to make art hard for himself and force a personal artistic breakthrough by abandoning the paintbrush. &quot;I threw away my tools&quot;, Close said. &quot;I chose to do things I had no facility with. The choice not to do something is in a funny way more positive than the choice to do something. If you impose a limit to not do something you&#x27;ve done before, it will push you to where you&#x27;ve never gone before.&quot; One photo of Philip Glass was included in his resulting black-and-white series in 1969, redone with watercolors in 1977, again redone with stamp pad and fingerprints in 1978, and also done as gray handmade paper in 1982.

Working from a gridded photograph, he built his images by applying one careful stroke after another in multi-colors or grayscale. He worked methodically, starting his loose but regular grid from the left hand corner of the canvas. His works are generally larger than life and highly focused. &quot;One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs. The everyday nature of the subject matter of the paintings likewise worked to secure the painting as a realist object.&quot;

Close said he had prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, in which he had difficulty recognizing new faces. By painting portraits, he was better able to recognize and remember faces. On the subject, Close said, &quot;I was not conscious of making a decision to paint portraits because I have difficulty recognizing faces. That occurred to me twenty years after the fact when I looked at why I was still painting portraits, why that still had urgency for me. I began to realize that it has sustained me for so long because I have difficulty in recognizing faces.&quot;

Although his later paintings differed in method from his earlier canvases, the preliminary process remained the same. To create his grid work copies of photos, Close put a grid on the photo and on the canvas and copied cell by cell. Typically, each square within the grid is filled with roughly executed regions of color (usually consisting of painted rings on a contrasting background) which give the cell a perceived &#x27;average&#x27; hue which makes sense from a distance. His first tools for this included an airbrush, rags, razor blade, and an eraser mounted on a power drill. His first picture with this method was &quot;Big Self Portrait&quot;, a black and white enlargement of his face to a canvas, made in over four months in 1968, and acquired by the Walker Art Center in 1969. He made seven more black and white portraits during this period. He has been quoted as saying that he used such diluted paint in the airbrush that all eight of the paintings were made with a single tube of Mars Black acrylic.

His later work branched into non-rectangular grids, topographic map style regions of similar colors, CMYK color grid work, and using larger grids to make the cell by cell nature of his work obvious even in small reproductions. The &quot;Big Self Portrait&quot; is so finely done that even a full page reproduction in an art book is still indistinguishable from a regular photograph.

===&quot;The Event&quot;===
On December 7, 1988, Close felt a strange pain in his chest. That day he was at a ceremony honoring local artists in New York City and was waiting to be called to the podium to present an award. Close delivered his speech and then made his way across the street to Beth Israel Medical Center where he had a seizure which left him paralyzed from the neck down. The cause was diagnosed as a spinal artery collapse. He had also experienced neuromuscular problems as a child. Close called that day &quot;The Event&quot;. For months, Close was in rehab strengthening his muscles with physical therapy; he soon had slight movement in his arms and could walk, yet only for a few steps. He relied on a wheelchair thereafter. Close spoke candidly about the effect disability had on his life and work in the book &quot;Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists&quot; written by Jean Kennedy Smith and George Plimpton and published by Random House.

However, Close continued to paint with a brush strapped onto his wrist, creating large portraits in low-resolution grid squares created by an assistant. Viewed from afar, these squares appear as a single, unified image which attempt photo-reality, albeit in pixelated form. Although the paralysis restricted his ability to paint as meticulously as before, Close had, in a sense, placed artificial restrictions upon his hyperrealist approach well before the injury. That is, he adopted materials and techniques that did not lend themselves well to achieving a photorealistic effect. Small bits of irregular paper or inked fingerprints were used as media to achieve astoundingly realistic and interesting results. Close proved able to create his desired effects even with the most difficult of materials to control. Close made a practice, during his final years, of portraying artists who are similarly invested in portraiture, like Cecily Brown, Kiki Smith, Cindy Sherman, and Zhang Huan.

===Prints===
Close was a printmaker throughout his career, with most of his prints published by Pace Editions, New York. He made his first serious foray into print making in 1972, when he moved himself and family to San Francisco to work on a mezzotint at Crown Point Press for a three-month residency. To accommodate him, Crown Point found the largest copper plate it could (36 inches wide) and purchased a new press, allowing Close to make a work that was 3 feet by 4 feet. In 1986 he went to Kyoto to work with Tadashi Toda, a highly respected woodblock printer.

In 1995, curator Colin Westerbeck used a grant from the Lannan Foundation to bring Close together with Grant Romer, director of conservation at the George Eastman House. From that time on, Close also continued to explore difficult photographic processes such as daguerreotype in collaboration with Jerry Spagnoli and sophisticated modular/cell-based forms such as tapestry. Close&#x27;s photogravure portrait of artist Robert Rauschenberg, &quot;Robert&quot; (1998), appeared in a 2009 exhibition at the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington, New York, featuring prints from Universal Limited Art Editions. In the daguerreotype photographs, the background defines the limit of the image plane as well as the outline of the subject, with the inky pitch-black setting off the light, reflective quality of the subject&#x27;s face.

In a 2014 interview with Terrie Sultan, Close said: &quot;I&#x27;ve had two great collaborators in the God knows how many years I&#x27;ve been making prints. One was the late Joe Wilfer, who was called the &#x27;prince of pulp&#x27; ... and now I&#x27;m working with Don Farnsworth in Oakland at...Magnolia Editions: I do the watercolor prints with him, I do the tapestries with him. These are the most important collaborations of my life as an artist.&quot;

Since 2012, Magnolia Editions has published an ongoing series of archival watercolor prints by Close which use the artist&#x27;s grid format and the precision afforded by contemporary digital printers to layer water-based pigment on Hahnemuhle rag paper such that the native behavior of watercolor is manifested in each print: &quot;The edges of each pixel bleed with cyan, magenta, and yellow, creating a kind of three-dimensional fog effect behind the intended color swatches.&quot; The watercolor prints are created using more than 10,000 of Close&#x27;s hand-painted marks which were scanned into a computer and then digitally rearranged and layered by the artist using his signature grid.
These works were called Close&#x27;s first major foray into digital imagery, with the artist himself having said, &quot;It&#x27;s amazing how precise a computer can be working with light and color and water.&quot; A New York Times review noted that the &quot;exaggerated breakdown of the image, particularly when viewed at close range,&quot; that characterizes Close&#x27;s work &quot;is also apparent in... [watercolor print] portraits of the artists Cecily Brown, Kiki Smith, Cindy Sherman, Kara Walker and Zhang Huan.&quot;

===Tapestries===
Close&#x27;s wall-size tapestry portraits, in which each image is composed of thousands of combinations of woven colored thread, depict subjects including Kate Moss, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Lucas Samaras, Philip Glass, Lou Reed, Roy Lichtenstein, and Close himself. They are produced in collaboration with Donald Farnsworth. Although many are translated from black-and-white daguerreotypes, all of the tapestries use multiple colors of thread. No printing is involved in their creation; colors and values appear to the viewer based on combinations of more than 17,800 colored warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads, in an echo of Close&#x27;s typical grid format. Close&#x27;s tapestry series began with a 2003 black-and-white portrait of Philip Glass. In August 2013 he debuted two color self-portraits at Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York. In reviewing this exhibition, Marion Weiss wrote, &quot;Close&#x27;s Jacquard tapestries are not obviously fragmented, but are created by repeating multicolor warp and weft threads that are optically blended. Thus, portraits of Lou Reed and Roy Lichtenstein, for example, seem &#x27;whole.&#x27; It&#x27;s only when we get closer that we see the individual threads, which are woven together.&quot;

===Commissions===
In 2010, Close was commissioned by MTA Arts &amp; Design to create twelve large mosaics, totaling more than , for the 86th Street subway station on the New York City Subway&#x27;s Second Avenue Line in Manhattan.

&quot;Vanity Fair&#x27;s&quot; 20th Annual Hollywood edition in March 2014 featured a portfolio of 20 Polaroid portraits of movie stars shot by Close, including Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, Helen Mirren, Julia Roberts, and Oprah Winfrey. Close requested that his subjects be ready to be photographed without makeup or hair-styling and used a large-format 20 in × 24 in Polaroid camera for the close-ups.

A fragment of Close&#x27;s portrait of singer-songwriter Paul Simon was used as the cover art for his 2016 album &quot;Stranger to Stranger&quot;. The right eye appears on the cover; the entire portrait is in the liner notes.

Close donated an original print of his &quot;Self Portrait&quot; in 2002 to the public library in Monroe, Washington, his hometown.

==Exhibitions==
Close&#x27;s first solo exhibition, held in 1967 at the University of Massachusetts Art Gallery, Amherst, featured paintings, painted reliefs, and drawings based on photographs of record covers and magazine illustrations. The exhibition captured the attention of the university administration which promptly closed it, citing the male nudity as obscene. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) came to the defense of Close and a landmark court case ensued. A Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice decided in favor of the artist against the university. When the university appealed Close chose not to return to Boston, and ultimately the decision was overturned by an appeals court. (Close was later awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the Arts by the University of Massachusetts in 1995.)

Close credited the Walker Art Center and its then-director Martin Friedman for launching his career with the purchase of &quot;Big Self-Portrait&quot; (1967–1968) in 1969, the first painting he sold. His first one-man show in New York City was in 1970 at Bykert Gallery. His first print was the focus of a &quot;Projects&quot; exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1972. In 1979 his work was included in the Whitney Biennial and the following year his portraits were the subject of an exhibition at the Walker Art Center. His work has since been the subject of more than 150 solo exhibitions including a number of major museum retrospectives. After Close abruptly canceled a major show of his work scheduled for 1997 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art announced that it would present a major midcareer retrospective of the artist&#x27;s work in 1998 (curated by Kirk Varnedoe and later traveling to the Hayward Gallery, London, and other galleries in 1999). In 2003 the Blaffer Gallery at the University of Houston presented a survey of his prints, which travelled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the following year. His most recent retrospective – &quot;Chuck Close Paintings: 1968/2006&quot;, at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid in 2007 – travelled to the Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst in Aachen, Germany, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. He also participated in almost 800 group exhibitions, including documentas V (1972) and VI (1977), the Venice Biennale (1993, 1995, 2003), and the Carnegie International (1995).

In 2013, Close&#x27;s work was featured in an exhibit at White Cube in Bermondsey, London. &quot;Process and Collaboration&quot; displayed not only a number of finished prints and paintings but included plates, woodblocks, and mylar stencils which were used to produce a number of prints.

In December 2014, his work was exhibited in Australia at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, which he visited.

In 2016, Close&#x27;s work was the subject of a retrospective at the Schack Art Center in Everett, Washington, where he attended high school and community college.

In 2021, a solo exhibition «Chuck Close. Infinite», held at the Gary Tatintsian Gallery in Moscow, featured the artist&#x27;s works in various techniques including oil painting, mosaic, and tapestry. The show became the artist&#x27;s last lifetime exhibition.

Close&#x27;s work is in the collections of most of the great international museums of contemporary art, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Tate Modern in London, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis who published &quot;Chuck Close: Self-Portraits 1967–2005&quot; coauthored with curators Siri Engberg and Madeleine Grynsztejn.

On July 23, 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a long lost painting by Close may have been recovered.

==Public profile==
===Recognition===
The recipient of the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton in 2000, the New York State Governor&#x27;s Art Award, and the Skowhegan Arts Medal, among many others, Close received over 20 honorary degrees including one from Yale University, his alma mater. In 1990, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1992. New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed the artist to the municipality&#x27;s Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, a body mandated by the City Charter to advise the mayor and the cultural affairs commissioner. Close painted President Clinton in 2006 and photographed President Barack Obama in 2012. In 2010 he was appointed by Obama to the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. He resigned from the President&#x27;s Committee in August 2017, co-signing a letter of resignation that said in reference to President Donald Trump, &quot;Ignoring your hateful rhetoric would have made us complicit in your words and actions.&quot;

In 2005, composer Philip Glass wrote a musical portrait of Close. The composition, a 15-minute piece for solo piano, was the idea of Bruce Levingston, a concert pianist, who commissioned it through the Premiere Commission and who performed the piece at a recital at Alice Tully Hall that year.

===Art market===
Close was represented by the Pace Gallery (in New York City) from 1977, and subsequently by White Cube (in London) from 1999. 

The artist&#x27;s most expensive works sold at auction:

# $4,300,000 – John, 1971. Sotheby&#x27;s, May 10, 2005. 
# $2,850,000 – Phil, 1983. Sotheby&#x27;s, Nov 14, 2006. 
# $2,700,000 – Eric, 1990. Sotheby&#x27;s, May 10, 2005. 
# $2,500,000 – Gwynne, 1982. Christie&#x27;s, May 11, 2004. 
# $2,405,000 – Self–Portrait, 2007. Christie&#x27;s, Nov 09, 2015. 

===Fundraising and community service===
In 1992, Close was one of 10 artists who volunteered to mentor economically deprived teens in a summer long photography program, Art Works: Teenagers and Artists Collaborate on the Polaroid 20 x 24 Camera, produced by artist and curator Janeil Engelstad, The Education Project and Polaroid.

In 2007, Close was honored by the New York Stem Cell Foundation and donated artwork for an exclusive online auction.

In September 2012, Magnolia Editions published two tapestry editions and three print editions by Close depicting President Barack Obama. The first tapestry was unveiled at the Mint Museum in North Carolina in honor of the Democratic National Convention. These tapestries and prints were sold as a fundraiser to support the Obama Victory Fund. A number of the works were signed by both Close and Obama. Close previously sold work at auction to raise funds for the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Al Gore.

In October 2013, Close donated a watercolor print of Genevieve Bahrenburg and a watercolor print self-portrait to ARTWALK NY, a cause that benefits the Coalition for the Homeless. In the same year work by Close was also sold to benefit the Lunchbox Fund.

Close was one of eight artists who volunteered in 2013 to participate in President Barack Obama&#x27;s Turnaround Arts initiative, which aims to improve low-performing schools by increasing student &quot;engagement&quot; through the arts. Close mentored 34 students in the sixth through eighth grades at Roosevelt School in Bridgeport, Connecticut, one of eight schools in the nation to participate in this public-private partnership developed in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education and the White House Domestic Policy Council. Close was honored by mayor Bill Finch with a key to the city at the November 7 reception at the Housatonic Community College Museum of Art, where five of Close&#x27;s watercolor prints were exhibited alongside artwork by students participating in the program.

===In the media===
In 1998, PBS broadcast documentary filmmaker Marion Cajori&#x27;s Emmy-nominated short, &quot;Chuck Close: A Portrait in Progress.&quot; In 2007, Cajori made &quot;Chuck Close&quot;, a full-length expansion of the first film. British art critic Christopher Finch wrote a biography, &quot;Chuck Close: Life&quot;, which was published in 2010, a sequel of sorts to Finch&#x27;s 2007 book, &quot;Chuck Close: Work&quot;, a career-spanning monograph.

Another documentary film was made on Close in 1998, titled Chuck Close: Eye To Eye: ART/New York No. 48, by his classmate at Yale University Paul Tschinkel.

Close appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on August 12, 2010, where he said that he watches the show every night.

Close was the subject of a Heinemann book, &quot;Rocks in His Shoes: The Story of Chuck Close&quot;, by Myka-Lynne Sokoloff, written for the Fountas &amp; Pinnell &quot;Leveled Literacy Intervention&quot; series.

===Sexual harassment allegations===
On December 20, 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; published stories detailing two women accusing Close of sexual misconduct, saying Close invited the women to his studio to pose for what they thought would be portraits, and then Close asked them to pose nude and made vulgar comments to them. Their accounts were of alleged sexual harassment in 2007 and 2013. In response to the accusations, Close issued a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying, &quot;If I embarrassed anyone or made them feel uncomfortable, I am truly sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to. I acknowledge having a dirty mouth, but we&#x27;re all adults&quot;. On January 16, 2018, &quot;Hyperallergic&quot; published the accounts of four more women who alleged Close harassed them. Their accounts were of alleged sexual harassment from 2001, 2009, and 2013. Most of the allegations were from women in their 20s, during the time that Close was in his 60s and 70s. Many of the allegations were from college students, including from Yale University. Following the allegations, the Dean of the Yale School of Art, Marta Kuzma, decided that &quot;in the best interest of the students, faculty, and greater community of the Yale School of Art that Mr. Close will no longer serve as a member of the Dean&#x27;s Council&quot;.

The National Gallery of Art cancelled a Chuck Close exhibition, planned to open May 2018, due to the allegations.

After Close died, his neurologist, Thomas M. Wisniewski, said that Close&#x27;s inappropriate sexual behavior, alleged to have occurred from at least 2001 to 2013, could be attributed to his 2015 diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. Wisniewski said that Close &quot;was very disinhibited and did inappropriate things, which were part of his underlying medical condition&quot;, and that this type of dementia &quot;destroys that part of the brain that governs behavior and inhibits base instincts&quot;, adding that &quot;sexual inappropriateness and disastrous financial decisions are common presenting symptoms&quot;.

==Personal life==
Close lived and worked in Bridgehampton and Long Beach, New York (both on the south shore of Long Island), and New York City&#x27;s East Village. He had two daughters with Leslie Rose. They divorced in 2011. Close married artist Sienna Shields in 2013. They later divorced.

Close was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2015. He died on August 19, 2021, in Oceanside, New York, at the age of 81, from congestive heart failure.

<text>François-Louis Français (; 1814–1897), usually known as Louis Français, was a French painter, lithographer and illustrator who became one of the most commercially successful landscape painters of the 19th century. A former pupil of Gigoux, he began his career by studying lithography and wood engraving, becoming a prolific illustrator and printmaker. His work as an illustrator is to be found in around forty books and numerous magazines from the late 1830s to the 1860s. Français also produced a large number of pen and ink drawings, enhanced by sepia, notable for their attention to detail and for their technical adroitness and conciseness.

Français is associated with the Barbizon School of painting, a movement to represent art in nature in a Romantic, Realist context. In 1836 whilst at Barbizon he met the landscape painter Camille Corot and began a ten-year association as a friend and acolyte. Français&#x27;s paintings possess some of the prominent features of the work of Corot in his use of tonal colours, loose brushwork and an emphasis on softness of form.
Français exhibited first at the Paris Salon in 1837 and regularly thereafter until his death in 1897. He lived from 1846 to 1849 in Italy, where he experimented with a brighter palette.His work developed neo-classical sentiments with mythical creatures appearing within a realist landscape. Whilst this bought him commercial success it alienated some critics who were harsh in their judgement of his work. A well respected and decorated artist within France, he was also internationally well known during his lifetime exhibiting abroad in Geneva and London but following his death in 1897, his reputation declined and there are relatively few of his paintings on show in public galleries beyond France.

==Early years==

François-Louis Français was born in Plombières-les-Bains in the Vosges region on 17 November 1814. He was the son of Jean Français, a mercer and Marie-Anne Français (née Vançon). He showed aptitude in drawing from an early age and attended classes in Plombières. His family wished to encourage him and in 1829 found him a job in a bookshop in Paris where he could build up contacts with a view to becoming an illustrator. Initially 
he worked as a copyist, produced caricatures and drew models at the Académie Suisse. In 1831 he began studying painting and his first known landscapes are from this period . It was a period of struggle during which he made a precarious living mainly by drawing on stone and designing woodcut vignettes for book illustration. The publishing firm of Paulin employed him and in 1833 offered Français the opportunity to illustrate some of the ornate letters in Alain-René Lesage&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane&quot; published in January 1835. The main illustrator of Lesage&#x27;s work was Jean Gigoux, an eminent painter and illustrator and impressed by Français&#x27; potential he invited him to work at his Parisian atelier.

== Illustrator and printmaker ==
As an illustrator Français had a long career, until 1860, during which he drew vignettes for numerous books and magazines. It was a lucrative occupation and allowed financial security whilst he simultaneously developed his painting techniques. His illustrations for a new edition of Bernardin&#x27;s romantic novel Paul et Virginie in 1835 were recognised as a high watermark of romantic illustration and began a profitable and prolific collaboration with the wood-engraver Tony Johannot, the culmination of which was around two hundred vignettes, including around fifty landscapes. He worked with his friends Henri Baron and Célestin Nanteuil on illustrations for &quot;Les Artistes anciens et modernes&quot;. Together they founded the revue &quot;Les artistes contemporains&quot; and worked in collaboration on numerous engravings for the publishing firm Bertauts, often using the monogram B.N.F. to identify their ownership.

A noteworthy commission were the illustrations in L&#x27;abbé Jean-Jacques Bourassé&#x27;s &quot;La Touraine. Histoire et monuments&quot; where Français provided forty wood engravings, five engraved plates and eleven beautiful ornate letters, for which he and his collaborator Karl Girardet, earned a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1855.
Amongst the many prints that he supervised were those done after Corot&#x27;s landscape, &quot;Sunset&quot; (1840), Diaz&#x27;s &quot;Bathers&quot; (1847) and several of his own paintings. Many prints were reused, for example, &quot;Un Chemin (A Road)&quot; was first published in Paris by Augustin Challamel for the Paris salon of 1842. Ten years later a second state was published by Marchant for the series, &quot;Les Peintres vivants&quot; .

==Painting career==

In 1834 Français went to live at Barbizon and painted in the nearby Forest of Fontainbleu. He was part of the Barbizon school of artists dedicated to painting directly from nature, often en plein air, who settled in the area around the Auberge Ganne Inn. In a radical departure from formalism in art, nature itself became the subject of the painting. as many artists met at the Inn to discuss ideas and to set forth to paint in the Forest. Français met and befriended fellow artist Louis Cabat and in 1836 he became acquainted with Camille Corot, eighteen years older than Français and with whom he formed a strong personal bond of friendship and as a personal adviser, who was willing to offer technical advice and to introduce Français to some influential people. Under Corot&#x27;s influence Français developed a style of landscape painting using tonal colours to express light that are reminiscent of Corot. Français was never able to capture Corot&#x27;s delicacy at depicting the human form but he developed exponentially 
into a fine landscape painter, albeit one that maintained an element of formalism. This formality was not surprising from a student of Gigoux but Français is known to have studied and admired the work of the early baroque painter Claude Lorrain’s work at The Louvre. The occasional use of neo-classical subjects and the placing of mythological figures within the landscape that Français sometimes adopted bear a resemblance to the oeuvre of Lorrain.

In 1837 Français exhibited at the Salon for the first time, presenting &quot;Sous les saules (Under the Willows)&quot; (1837: Tours museum), a painting where the figures are by Henri Baron. The exhibition catalogue listed 2,130 entries but Français&#x27; painting was noticed and commented upon favourably.
In the mid-1840s, Français travelled regularly with Baron and their friend Nanteuil, to Bougival, a village on the Seine increasingly famous for its scenery and light changes. The paintings from this period, several of which were transposed to lithographs, are often signed &quot;Français, Elèves de Bougival (Student of Bougival)&quot;. &quot;Soleil couchant&quot; (1845, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon), an autumnal landscape of the river at Bougival, was presented at the 1845 Salon of Charles Baudelaire, one of three that the poet organised. Baudelaire praised the canvas, as an example, of how to capture the poetic realism of nature.

In 1846 Français travelled to Italy for the first time staying in various locations: Rome (1846/9), Genoa (1846), Pisa (1846), Florence (1846/7), Frascati (1847), Ariccia (1848) and Tivoli (1848/49). This extended sojourn enabled Français to develop his style. His palette became more luminous and he began to paint in the closely set strokes that would be a feature of his later work. He acquired a passion for painting the light and would return to Italy throughout his career. He accumulated numerous drawings, sketches and watercolours often in gouache which enabled him to execute some of his best known canvases from the period that included &quot;Fontaine à Ariccia (Fountain at Ariccia) (1848, Paris Mus d ‘Orsay)&quot;. Returning to France he travelled and painted extensively throughout France in the 1850s. He regularly visited Plombières and the Loire valley, where he favoured realistic forest landscapes and riverbanks scenes.
Français was often in the company of other artists during these visits and with Corot, Courbet, Jongkind and the locally born Boudin, he was part of &quot;école de Honfleur&quot; (&quot;Honfleur school&quot;) that was drawn to paint the light and landscapes around Honfleur in Normandy. The images created during this interlude, by Français and his fellow artists, later inspired Jongkind and Claude Monet to open the Impressionist School of St. Simeon at Honfleur in 1862. &quot;Les Hêtres de la côte de Grâce près de Honfleur (1859)&quot; is a fine example of his work in Normandy in the 1850s. It features a weathered tree distorted by the coastal winds that buffet the coast. As always with Français there is precision in the detail. Much of the painting features a forbidding sky that pays debt to Français&#x27; knowledge of Constable.

==Career after 1860==

Français was a successful painter by the 1860s. He had a regular income, not least from his patron the Alsatian industrialist Alfred Hartmann, the younger brother of Frédéric Hartmann, Théodore Rousseau’s long-suffering and most important patron of the Second Empire. His paintings were invariably accepted at the Parisian salons. They were not always well received by some critics. His painting, &quot;Bois sacré&quot;, &quot;(Sacred wood) (1864)&quot;, now at the Lille, Palais des Beaux-Arts was heavily criticised, as not up to standard by some observers, who objected to the admittedly dominant, mythical figures at the centre of a realist canvas. His patron Hartmann didn’t like it either, as he made clear in a letter to Rousseau. &quot;Le Bois sacré&quot; was one of a series of popular realism landscapes containing neo-classical themes that Français produced in the 1860s, often from sketches made following an Italian visit such as that to Naples in 1859 and to Pompeii in 1864-5.

He continued to travel extensively throughout his life and in common with many well-off French people would spend his winters in warmer southern climes, after 1873 in Nice, often with his companion Rose Maireau, an engraver who exhibited her work at Petit Palais shortly after it opened in 1900. In 1878, after six years of intermittent work he completed a series of decorative panels for the font of the new Second Empire church of Sainte-Trinité, Paris The avowed socialism of Français’ youth had receded to that of patriarch of the Third Republic. Also in 1878 &quot;Le Mont Cervin et Le Lac de Némi (The Matterhorn and the Lake of Némi)&quot; was awarded the Médaille d&#x27;honneur at the Paris Salon. A year after in 1879 Français was a founding member of the &quot;Société d&#x27;aquarellistes français&quot; (Society of French Watercolourists), the aim of which was to exhibit the watercolour paintings of the members, initially limited to just forty. The Society ceased in 1896.

At the 1884 Salon, he exhibited &quot;L&#x27;Étang de Clisson (Forest of Clisson)&quot; following a visit to the Loire valley. An evocation of the upper Loire, the preparatory drawings for which are at the Metropolitan Museum, the finished canvas has a freshness and a poetic naturalism reminiscent of Français’ work in the 1850s. One of his most successful later paintings is &quot;Vue d&#x27;Antibes&quot; (1894) where he returned with some effect to the landscapes and skies of Corot and Millet.

Français entered his final decade as a man with a considerable artistic reputation. In 1890 he was the first landscape artist to be elected to the Chair of the Académie Française, the same year he won the Médaille d&#x27;honneur at the Société des Artistes Français where he exhibited two landscapes. He had international recognition which eluded many French artists. He exhibited at Geneva in 1857, 1858 and 1861 and in London in 1862 and 1874. Following his death a rather grand memorial was erected to his memory at Plombières-les-Bains. His former studio in Plombières is now the Musée Louis Français 

François-Louis Français died in Plombières on 18 May 1897.

<text>The thick-billed longspur, also known as McCown&#x27;s longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii), is a small ground-feeding bird in the family Calcariidae, which also contains the other longspurs and snow buntings. It is found in North America and is the only species in the genus Rhynchophanes.

==Taxonomy==
The thick-billed longspur was described in 1851 by the American amateur ornithologist George Newbold Lawrence under the English name rufous-winged lark bunting. He placed it in the genus &quot;Plectrophanes&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Plectrophanes mccownii&quot;. It was moved into its own genus &quot;Rhynchophanes&quot; in 1858 by Spencer Baird on account of its bill size and short spur, but was moved to &quot;Calcarius&quot; after a hybrid with the chestnut-collared longspur was discovered. It was once again placed in its own genus after a 2003 genetic study found it was more closely related to the snow buntings than the other longspurs.

&quot;McCown&#x27;s longspur&quot; is no longer used by the American Ornithological Society, instead being changed to &quot;thick-billed longspur&quot;, a literal translation of its genus name, &quot;Rhynchophanes&quot;. The IOC Bird List has followed suit with the name change.

The name &quot;McCown&quot; refers to Captain John P. McCown, an American army officer who collected the specimen in 1851 that led to the species first being scientifically described. McCown later fought for the Confederacy, which led to controversy starting in 2018, with parallels drawn to the removal of Confederate memorials. The pressure to change the name increased following the George Floyd protests and Black Birder&#x27;s Week (itself a response to the Central Park birdwatching incident).

==Description==
The thick-billed longspur is about long, has a wingspan of and weighs around . It has a large cone-shaped bill, a streaked back, a rust-coloured shoulder and a white tail with a dark tip. In breeding plumage, the male has a white throat and underparts, a grey face and nape and a black crown. Breeding females are largely gray, with a pale bill and rusty tinged median coverts and scapulars. Non-breeding males are similar to females but with crowns spotted rather than streaked, and more chestnut on their median coverts and scapulars.

Juveniles are seen briefly in late summer and are more uniformly sandy, with a streaked upper breast and white belly.

==Distribution and habitat==
Thick-billed longspurs breed in the northwestern Great Plains states and southern Prairie Provinces. They prefer the sparsely vegetated habitat of the semi-arid shortgrass steppes, which provide a mix of perennial shortgrasses and cacti. The breeding range of thick-billed longspurs has drastically reduced; historically, it stretched farther south into Oklahoma, and east into Minnesota and Manitoba.

Their non-breeding range stretches from south Oklahoma into Texas and Northern Mexico. Here, they prefer open habitats with sparse vegetation such as shortgrass prairie, plowed fields, grazed pastures and dried lake beds.

==Behavior==
The male produces a distinctive tinkling song, often in flight. The calls include a dry rattle.

Nests are constructed in a shallow depression on the ground, and incubate the eggs for about 12 days. Both parents feed the young, and fledglings leave the nest about 10 days after hatching, before they can properly fly. Outside the breeding season, thick-billed longspurs occur in flocks, sometimes with other species like Lapland longspur and horned lark.

The diet consists of seeds and insects.

==Conservation==

The numbers and range of these birds have declined since the early 1900s, likely due to habitat loss.

<text>To assume a brace position or crash position is an instruction that can be given to prepare for a crash, such as on an aircraft; the instruction to &quot;Brace for impact!&quot; or &quot;Brace! Brace!&quot; is often given if the aircraft must make an emergency landing on land or water. There are many different ways to adopt the brace position, with many countries adopting their own version based on research performed by their own aviation authority or that of other countries. The most common in passenger airliners being the forward-facing seat version, in which the person bracing places their head against or as close as possible to the surface it is likely to strike (and in the process bending over to some degree), placing their feet firmly on the floor, and their hands either on their head or the seat in front.

== Types of brace position ==
There are many different ways to adopt the brace position, with many countries adopting their own version based on research performed by their own aviation authority or that of other countries. There is commonality among all brace positions despite these variations.
===Forward-facing seat===
For a forward seated passenger wearing only a lap belt, common recommendations for the brace position include:
* Place head on, or as close as possible to, the surface it is most likely to strike. (For example, the bulkhead or seat in front.) 
* Bend forward at the waist to some degree to avoid jackknifing or submarining (sliding) forward in the seat and out from under the belt.
* Place both feet on the floor, either flat or on the balls of the feet.

In the United Kingdom, the brace-for-impact position for forward-facing passengers was optimised following the Kegworth air disaster in 1989. In that incident, the pilot announced &quot;Prepare for crash landing&quot; 10 seconds before impact, and the resulting injuries—from both those who did and did not adopt the brace position—would later be studied. The UK Civil Aviation Authority funded an engineering–medical joint research team, led by Nigel Rock of Hawtal Whiting Engineering Consultants and Prof. Angus Wallace of the Nottingham University Hospital and aided by Wing Commander David Anton of the Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. Crash data was supplemented by medical information from the University of Nottingham and testing at the Institute of Aviation Medicine. The work used mathematical modelling derived from the automobile industry to analyse the human body under crash conditions. (See &quot;Further reading&quot; below.)

This work led to the formation of the International Board for Research into Aircraft Crash Events (IBRACE) on 21 November 2016.

The brace position as set out to airlines in the UK for passengers in forward-facing seats is based on extensive analytical work arising from Kegworth. It is subtly different from that in the United States and some other countries. Passengers should place their feet and knees together with their feet firmly on the floor (either flat or on the balls of their feet) and tucked behind the knees to prevent shins and legs from being broken against the base of the seat in front. They should bend as far forward as possible, resting their head against the seat in front if it is within reach and place their hands on the back of their head, with the hands one on top of another (rather than interlocked). Their elbows should then be brought in. This prevents both flailing of the arms in the crash sequence and protects the head from flying debris. The head should be as far below the top of the seats as possible to prevent injury from any collapsing overhead compartments.

The brace procedure for the forward-facing seat in the United States is similar to that of the UK, but rather than placing the hands on the back of the head, passengers are advised to place them on the top of the seat in front, one hand holding the other wrist and resting the head in the space between the arms. If the seat in front is not within reach then passengers are advised to either grab their ankles or place their hands under their legs and grab the opposite forearm.

===Jumpseats===
Flight attendant brace positions are somewhat different due to the design of aircraft jumpseats. So far, there has been little research into the best brace position for flight attendants, though airlines have adopted positions that are very similar to one another.

In rear-facing seats, the attendant should be sitting with their back and head firmly against the back of the jumpseat, their knees and feet together and slightly in front of or behind the knee (depending on the individual airline&#x27;s procedures)—commonly referred to as &quot;toes to tail&quot;. In European carriers, the hands can be placed behind the head and hands one on top of the other and the elbows brought in to meet, taking care that the forearm does not cover the ear and restrict hearing. This position provides the flight attendant protection to the face from any flying debris (as it will impact their elbows) yet still provides them with the ability to view the cabin and not muffle their commands. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not recommend placing the hands behind the neck as their research suggests such actions can cause unnecessary loading on the neck and spine during an impact. Instead, US flight attendants are typically taught to sit on their hands, palms facing the ceiling, underneath their upper legs. Other variations include clasping the hands on the knees or using one arm to &quot;hug&quot; the opposing arm.

For forward-facing jumpseats, the position is the same but with the feet behind the knees. Some airlines also require flight attendants to tuck their chin in to their chest (&quot;Bow to the captain&quot;) to reduce the likelihood of whiplash injuries.

There is also a third brace position for flight attendants, the &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;semi&quot; brace position. This is adopted by the attendant for every take-off and landing; it provides them with protection from any sudden emergencies and allows them to adopt the full brace position quickly should they need to. The only difference between the normal brace and the full brace position is that the attendants will either fold their arms across their stomach or immobilize them by placing their hands under their thighs with the palms up. This position forms part of every flight attendant&#x27;s sixty second review—a technique adopted by airlines whereby the attendant will go over various factors in their head during the take-off and landing sequence. Things such as &quot;How do I open my door?&quot;, &quot;Where is the next nearest exit?&quot;, &quot;Am I over land or water?&quot; and &quot;what commands will I shout&quot; are just a few of the questions an attendant will ask themselves. The belief is that this mental review focuses the attendant on the safety-critical role they have during take-off and landing and will result in faster decision-making and adaptation to the scenario.

Newer brace positions are being adopted by many U.S. airlines in which the flight attendants do not sit on their hands. Instead, they place their hands flat on top of their thighs. This new position is being adopted because in the event of a crash, sitting on hands can cause injury and/or crushing.

===Infants===
If carrying an infant on a lap, it is generally recommended that above positions should be adopted as well as possible, cradling the child with one arm and using this to also protect the child&#x27;s head. In the UK, lap children are instructed to wear an infant safety belt which is a separate seat belt with a loop that connects to the parent&#x27;s belt; however, in the United States such belts are not permitted by FAA regulations. The FAA believes that such baby belts significantly increase the risk of injury to the child. In the early era of commercial aviation, the recommended brace position for children was on the floor against a bulkhead; this has since been amended due to the position&#x27;s lack of protection. The safest position for an infant is in an aviation-certified child safety seat.

==Instruction==

===Routine instruction===
Many government aviation administrations or regulatory bodies mandate the depiction of how to adopt the brace position on aircraft safety cards and in-flight safety demonstrations. Examples are a 1993 ruling by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (issued in a Notice to Air Operator Certificate Holders 1993) and CAO 020.11 (section 14.1.3) issued by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia. The FAA has not required this instruction on flights to, from, or within the United States.

The depiction of how to adopt the brace position is not a basic standard set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

==Successful use==
A 2015 study by the Federal Aviation Administration has concluded that brace positions, particularly the forward-facing seat position, significantly reduce the risk of head and neck injuries in impacts. When Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 crashed in 1991, all passengers aboard survived; a &quot;significant factor&quot; to this outcome was the passengers&#x27; universal adoption of the brace position. During the &quot;Miracle on the Hudson&quot; emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in 2009, the pilot warned &quot;Brace for impact&quot; and flight attendants chanted, &quot;Brace! Brace! Brace! Heads down! Stay down!&quot; All 155 people on board survived with no life-threatening injuries. In a press interview, one of the surviving crew members of the LaMia Flight 2933 crash in 2016 said that he had survived because he followed the emergency protocols by putting his carry-on suitcase between his legs and sitting in the brace position.

== Conspiracy theories ==
Conspiracy theories and urban legends spread through the internet since the 2000s suggest that the brace position is ineffective at stopping injuries or deaths, and that the actual intention behind its adoption is to kill passengers in crashes, either to ensure a painless death, preserve their remains, or to avoid lawsuits against the airline. Such claims have been debunked by the &quot;MythBusters&quot;, by fact-checking website Snopes and by aviation professionals.

<text>Glen Rangwala is a University Lecturer and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge University in England. Trained in political theory and international law, he completed a doctorate on political and legal rhetoric in the Arab Middle East. His academic work focuses on Palestinian politics from 1967 to 1977, and the rhetorical relations between the West Bank resident population and the leadership of the Palestinian resistance movement in exile. He has co-written a monograph, &quot;Iraq in Fragments&quot; (Cornell University Press, 2006), on the fragmentation of the Iraqi polity following the invasion of 2003. He has also published on international humanitarian law, comparative human rights law, Iraq and nuclear weapons. He is a member of the Labour Party and an editor of Labour Briefing.

He is involved with Campaign Against Sanctions on Iraq (dissolved and replaced by Cambridge Solidarity with Iraq in October 2003) and Arab Media Watch. In the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war Rangwala wrote articles in newspapers and appeared on British TV, especially in the context of the &quot;dodgy dossier&quot; prepared by Tony Blair&#x27;s government. Rangwala had discovered that this dossier was mostly plagiarised from a postgraduate student&#x27;s thesis and articles in Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review (with minor falsifications) and traced back the people who had edited the dossier . He submitted written evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs when it investigated the British government&#x27;s information policy leading to the Iraq war . He has since published a number of articles on the Iraq war, especially in The Independent .

Together with Dan Plesch, he contributed an article to &quot;A Case to Answer&quot;, a report commissioned by MP Adam Price on which impeachment procedures against Tony Blair are based. The report assembles evidence that Blair misled the British Parliament and people over reasons for the 2003 war on Iraq mainly from the PM&#x27;s own statements and evidence disclosed by the Hutton Inquiry and the Butler Report.

<doc id="840050" wikidata="Q336908" url="?curid=840050" title="Meindert Hobbema">
<text>Meindert Lubbertszoon Hobbema (bapt. 31 October 1638 – 7 December 1709) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of landscapes, specializing in views of woodland, although his most famous painting, &quot;The Avenue at Middelharnis&quot; (1689, National Gallery, London), shows a different type of scene.
Hobbema was a pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael, the pre-eminent landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age, and in his mature period produced paintings developing one aspect of his master&#x27;s more varied output, specializing in &quot;sunny forest scenes opened by roads and glistening ponds, fairly flat landscapes with scattered tree groups, and water mills&quot;, including over 30 of the last in paintings.
The majority of his mature works come from the 1660s; after he married and took a job as an exciseman in 1668 he painted less, and after 1689 apparently not at all. He was not very well known in his lifetime or for nearly a century after his death, but became steadily more popular from the last decades of the 18th century until the 20th century.

==Life==

Hobbema was born and died in Amsterdam. The son of a carpenter named Lubbert Meyndertsz, he adopted his grandmother´s surname Hobbema quite early on, although it is not known why. He spent a period in an orphanage from 1653, but by about two years later he had left, and soon became the only documented pupil of the leading Amsterdam landscapist, Jacob van Ruisdael, whose influence was to dominate his work. Jan van Kessel may also have been a pupil of Ruisdael; he was close to Hobbema, who was godfather to his child in 1675.

Hobbema&#x27;s signed pictures come from 1658 to 1689. For a considerable period it was profitable to pass off Hobbemas as Ruisdaels, and Hobbema&#x27;s name was probably removed from several of his works. Hobbema seems to have painted the figures on a number of Ruisdael&#x27;s paintings; they were recognised as a weakness of the master. They may have travelled together a short way across the German border in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum.

Hobbema married at the age of 30, to Eeltje Vinck from Gorcum, a maidservant to the burgomaster Lambert Reynst, at this point an important political figure in the &quot;republican&quot; Dutch States Party as brother-in-law to the De Graeff brothers (but soon to lose office and influence in the Rampjaar of 1672). She was four years older than him. The wedding was in the Oude Kerk (Old Church) at Amsterdam, on 2 November 1668. Witnesses to the marriage were the bride&#x27;s brother Cornelius Vinck and Jacob van Ruisdael.

The couple had five children (Eduart 1669, Eduart 1670, Pieternella 1671, Pieternella 1673 and Neeltje 1676). In 1704 Eeltje died, and was buried in the paupers&#x27; section of the Leiden cemetery at Amsterdam. Hobbema himself survived till December 1709, and was buried on the 14th of that month in the paupers&#x27; section of the Westerkerk cemetery at Amsterdam.

Also in 1668, and presumably through the connection with his wife&#x27;s ex-employer, he took the well-paid position of &quot;wine-gauger&quot; for the Amsterdam octroi, assessing and collecting local taxes on wine, holding this until his death. It is clear that his painting greatly reduced after this, but it did not end completely, as used to be thought. The quality of his work becomes uneven, though there are very successful late works, including &quot;The Avenue at Middelharnis&quot;, dated 1689 and one of his last paintings. After 1672 the Dutch art market &quot;virtually collapsed&quot; for the rest of the century, and other artists of his approximate generation produced much less, including Johannes Vermeer, Pieter de Hooch and Nicolaes Berchem.

The Hobbema family lived in the Rozengracht in the Jordaan neighbourhood, as had Rembrandt in his later and impoverished days, as well as Adam Pynacker, Jacob van Loo, Cornelis Holsteyn and other artists. Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jacob Ruisdael, and Hobbema all died in relative poverty, after they had fallen from fashion, and in Hobbema&#x27;s case after the Dutch art market had largely collapsed.

Hobbema and Ruisdael together represent the final development of Golden Age Dutch landscape art; by the end of Hobbema&#x27;s career, demand had severely declined.

==Work==

Despite his apprenticeship with Jacob van Ruisdael, Hobbema&#x27;s earliest paintings, from the late 1650s, are mostly river scenes more in the style of Cornelis Vroom and Salomon van Ruysdael. From around 1662 the influence of Jacob van Ruisdael becomes much stronger, and Hobbema settled into his speciality of wooded landscapes, very often with ponds, roads, and a building or two. Even within the Dutch painting of his day, where specialization in a particular type of subject-matter had become normal, his concentration on such a specific subject was rather unusual.

The remainder of the 1660s, especially up to 1668, produced most of his best works, which increased in size and complexity as he perfected his style. His landscapes are sunnier than the equivalent scenes by Jacob van Ruisdael, with the principal trees typically seen with sky behind. His skill at varying effects of light and colour throughout a work is exceptional. He often makes use of double vanishing points to add interest to the composition. Some of his compositions, as late as 1664, are near-copies of Jacob van Ruysdael, and he often repeats his own compositions with variations; four of the five works in the Wallace Collection have other versions. For some of these he made use of assistants, though little is known about them or their role.

His paths or roads normally wind diagonally across his composition through dense trees and vegetation, the trees spreading and varying in size. The water mills and other buildings are generally seen in the near distance, and generally only one or two appear in each picture. His compositions are carefully contrived and presumably imaginary, normally avoiding all symmetry.

&quot;The Avenue at Middelharnis&quot;, a very late work, is a surprising break from most of these somewhat &quot;tired conventions of his earlier work&quot;, and a very accurate depiction of a specific spot. In contrast to his usual scenes of rough woodland, in this scene the straight lines, lopped trees, deep drainage ditches on both sides of the road, and regimented young trees in the plot to the right, all emphasize the man-made nature of this landscape. A patch of rough woodland remains in the left foreground, contrasting with the saplings in rows on the right. The man tending to these is unusual in 17th-century Dutch landscapes, which rarely show anyone working the land. 
&quot;The Haarlem Lock, Amsterdam&quot; in the National Gallery is his only generally accepted townscape, and still shows a foreground mainly of trees and water. The corner of the street where Hobbema was living by 1668 can be seen at the left. In some cases he delegated the human figures in his paintings to Adriaen van de Velde and perhaps others, a common practice in the period. In others he did the figures but probably sub-contracted birds and animals.

He often painted on oak panels, at least to the late 1660s; of the nine paintings in the National Gallery, five are on oak, but not the two dated 1689. No drawings certainly by him survive, and only a few are attributed. Despite this, it is thought that his compositions were mainly assembled and painted in the studio from a number of elements presumably recorded in drawings.

==Reputation==
Hobbema is not mentioned by Arnold Houbraken, the Vasari of the Dutch Golden Age, or indeed any literary source during his lifetime at all, and his work rarely appears in early auction catalogues, fetching little when it does. The English, and to some extent the French, were more appreciative of his work than the Dutch in the 18th century, and a large number of his works left Holland. His style had become influential and respected by the Romantic period, and began to climb in value, especially in England. He was loved by John Constable, John Crome and the Norwich School of painters, all of whom he influenced.

By the 1820s prices could be over £1,000, and by 1900 over £10,000. A record price of £33,000 (equivalent) was reached in 1933 with a sale to America of a work from the Jan Six collection. The highest recent prices include a painting now in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, sold in December 1995 for £3.74 million (illustrated above), and a larger picture now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, sold in July 2001 for £6.5 million, both at Sotheby&#x27;s.

Hobbema&#x27;s modern critical reputation is equivocal, with several critics expressing a degree of boredom with his woodland scenes, while others are more appreciative. &quot;The Avenue at Middelharnis&quot; remains in near-universal favour, placed in a category by itself: &quot;it is as if the artist had produced only a single picture&quot; according to Christopher Lloyd. The situation is not helped by the surprising lack of art historical scholarship on him; there has not been a monograph since 1938, and that received a savage review from Neil MacLaren, the National Gallery&#x27;s Dutch specialist. Kenneth Clark thought that &quot;an artist as skillful as Hobbema grows tedious, because the elaboratedly described trees in his woodland scenes are not subordinated to a general principle of light&quot;.

==Other==
* In 1891 a hamlet in Alberta (Canada) was called Hobbema after the painter. On 1 January 2014 the name was changed to Maskwacis (meaning Bear Hills) on request of the native Cree who live in the area.

<doc id="840053" wikidata="Q24570440" url="?curid=840053" title="Chivi vireo">
<text>The chivi vireo (Vireo chivi) is a small South American songbird in the family Vireonidae. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the red-eyed vireo. It is usually green to yellow-green in color with off-white underparts, and a gray crown. It has a whitish supercilium extending over its ear coverts, and its lores are dull gray in color. The chivi vireo has nine subspecies. It is found throughout most of northern, eastern and central South America, only being absent from southern Chile and southern Argentina. It inhabits multiple types of habitat across its range, and appears to adjust well to slightly disturbed habitat. The chivi vireo is mainly resident, but at least two of the subspecies inhabiting the south of its range are known to be migratory.

The chivi vireo mates from May to June or October to January, depending on the region and subspecies. It makes cup nests and lay eggs in clutches of 2–4 which are incubated by the female, taking 10–16 days to hatch. Nestlings take 10–13 days to fully develop. The majority of the bird&#x27;s diet is composed of arthropods, although some subspecies eat fruit and some are also thought to be nectarivorous.

==Taxonomy==
The chivi vireo was described by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1817 and given the binomial name &quot;Sylvia chivi&quot;. The specific epithet is an onomatopoeia for its song, which Vieillot rendered as &quot;chivi-chivi&quot;. Vieillot based his description on that for the &quot;Gaviero&quot; by the Spaniard Félix de Azara that had been published in 1802. Ornithologists previously treated the chivi vireo as a subspecies of the red-eyed vireo (&quot;Vireo olivaceus&quot;), but unlike the red-eyed vireo that migrates to North America, the chivi vireo remains in South America to breed and does not migrate. Based on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2017 that found significant genetic differences and little introgression, the chivi vireo was promoted to species status.

=== Subspecies ===
There are 9 subspecies of the chivi vireo:

* &quot;V. c. chivi&quot; – The nominate, it is found in west and southwest Amazonia and south to central Argentina. It weighs , with a bill length of and a wing length of . 
* &quot;V. c. agilis&quot; – Found in east Brazil south through to Rio de Janeiro. It weighs . It is more brightly colored then the nominate, with a paler gray crown, the sides of the breast, flanks and vent being a brighter yellow.
* &quot;V. c. griseobarbatus&quot; – Found in west Ecuador and northwest Peru. It weighs , with a bill length of in males and in females and a wing length of . It tends to have a brighter green back than the nominate, with dark line bordering the crown and more yellow on the underparts, especially the flanks.
*&quot;V. c. caucae&quot; – Found in west Colombia, on the Pacific coast, the western slopes of the West Andes and the valleys of the upper Río Patía and Río Cauca. It looks similar to the nominate subspecies, but is darker with more grayish ear coverts.
*&quot;V. c. vividior&quot; – Found in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, north Brazil and Trinidad. It weighs , with a bill length of and a wing length of . It has brighter yellow-green upperparts, with a relatively longer bill.
* &quot;V. c. solimoensis&quot; – Found in east Ecuador, northeast Peru and extreme west Brazil. It weighs , with a bill length of in males and in females and a wing length of . It is small, with a bright yellow behind, and the gray crown extending over to the hindneck.
* &quot;V. c. tobagensis&quot; – Found in Tobago. It is a large subspecies, with a heavy bill and a darker back.
* &quot;V. c. diversus&quot; – Found in east Paraguay, southeast Brazil, Uruguay and northeast Argentina. It weighs , with a wing length of . Looks similar to &quot;agilis&quot;, but has darker and duller upperparts, a brown-tinged back, and a mouse-gray on the top of the head. It is differs from &quot;chivi&quot; by having greener upperparts, flanks and sides, and a more yellow crissum (area surrounding the cloaca).
*&quot;V. c. pectoralis&quot; – Found in north Peru, with a suspected population in Zamora-Chinchipe in southeastern Ecuador. Similar to &quot;griseobarbatus,&quot; but larger, with gray-tinged breast and throat and darker and duller green on the back.

== Description ==

The species looks similar to the related red-eyed vireo and yellow-green vireo. It is in length, with the mass and length of the bill and wings varying in different subspecies.

Hatchlings are born almost naked with yellow skin and sparse down. Juveniles have brownish or tawny (depending on subspecies) upperparts, with the greater and median coverts having brownish-green tips, and the head showing a less contrasting pattern than adults. The mouth lining is paler than adults up until 6 months of age. They may also show molt contrast on their wings.

Adult vireos are very similar, except in the subspecies &quot;diversus,&quot; where the female is smaller than the male. The crown is medium gray with thin but well defined gray borders, with a whitish supercilium extending above the ear coverts. The lores are a dull gray, and the nape, along with the side of the neck and the rest of the upperparts being a dull olive green. The area below the eyes is off-white in color. The wing coverts are dull gray brown, edged with olive green. The rectrices are green-gray in color, and have bright green edges. The undertail is very pale. The throat, breast, and belly are off-white or grayish-white in color, with a greenish tinge to the flank and sides of the breast. The upper mandible of the beak varies in color from black to blackish brown or a dusky gray, with the mandible being pale to blue-gray in color with a dark tip and paler base. The iris is brown in color, although it varies in shade from pale brown to reddish brown. The legs are pale brown to pale gray in color.

=== Calls ===
The calls of the species are typical of most of &quot;Vireo&quot;, but it has a very simple repertoire with only one song and one vocalization. Its song is a pattern of brief musical sound with pauses in between. The song of the South American subspecies is usually &quot;&quot;chew-lee chew-lew wee-chee chew leee&quot;, while the song of &quot;griseobarbatus&quot; is a &quot;tche-wit ... tche-wut&quot; repeated constantly during the breeding season. &quot;solimoensis&quot; is said to have a shorter and more repetitive song, while the song of the migratory populations in the south of the range is said to more complex than that of resident subspecies. In Bolivia, the song is said to be composed of &quot;chee’wee? chee’wip&quot; repeated. The principal call is a raspy &quot;zheer&quot;, or a more nasal &quot;jeeyr&quot;, with the warning call being &quot;gweh&quot; or &quot;greh&quot;&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This bird is very widespread across most of northern, eastern, and central South America, with the exception of southern Chile and southern Argentina. Resident populations of the chivi vireo occur across northeastern Colombia, into Venezuela and the entirety of the Guianas into eastern Brazil. They also occur alongside many rivers in Amazonia, continuing into parts of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, with some resident populations inhabiting western Colombia. More migratory populations are found in south and southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay, along with the northern areas of Argentina. In the non-breeding season these populations travel north as far as Venezuela, eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, and eastern Peru.

It inhabits the canopy and subcanopy of dry to wet forests, along with borders, light woodland, restinga, gallery forest in the cerrado, dense scrub, small tree groves, and secondary growth with tall trees. It inhabits semi-deciduous, várzea and secondary forests in Peru, ascending into montane valleys in the south. In central Amazonian Brazil, the bird is not common in mature forests, with these habitats being inhabited by migrant red-eyed vireos. It has been recorded up to an elevation of in Bolivia and in Peru, but is usually only found up to an elevation of in Colombia and Brazil, and up to an elevation of in Ecuador. It can also inhabit highly disturbed and modified habitats as long as tall trees are present.

== Ecology and behavior ==
The species is largely resident throughout its range, but in the south of its range, the subspecies &quot;chivi&quot; and &quot;diversus&quot; are known to be migratory. There are also some subspecies that are likely to undertake short migrations.

=== Diet and foraging ===
The species is primarily an insectivore, but some populations are known to consume fruit, and they may be important seed dispersers for some plants. It mainly consumes arthropods, especially caterpillars and other insect larva. They have been recorded consuming fruits of &quot;Myrsine coriacea, Rapanea lancifolia, Myrsine ferruginea, Trichilia spp., Cabralea canjerana, Talauma ovata, Davilla rugosa, Nectandra megapotamica, Byrsonima sericea, Miconia minutiflora, Cupania emarginata and oblongifolia, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Trema micrantha, Alchornea glandulosa,&quot; and &quot;Pera glabrata&quot;. It is thought to be an important seed disperser for &quot;Cabralea canjerana.&quot; It is also suspected of being nectarivorous.

=== Reproduction ===
The species nests in the austral spring in the south of its range, and in the middle of the year in the north. The populations in Venezuela, Tobago, and Colombia nest in May–June, while the populations of the nominate subspecies in Peru have been seen nesting in November. Brazilian populations are thought to nest in October–January.

Nests of &quot;vividior&quot; are generally built in a cup shape out of grass, vegetable fibers, and small amounts of plant down in a tree fork, while nests of &quot;griseobarbatus&quot; are cup-shaped structures built out of dry weeds, vines, and bark and lined with black lichen, feathers, and seed down. The nests of &quot;griseobarbatus&quot; had an external height and depth of 50 mm and 77 mm, with an internal height and depth of 31 mm and 52 mm.

Eggs are laid in clutches of 2–4 at a time. Eggs vary in appearance and size between different subspecies. The mean size of eggs in &quot;griseobarbatus&quot; is reported to be , while that size of eggs in Brazil is , and the size of eggs in Argentina being . The average mass of eggs measured in southeastern Brazil was .

Eggs of &quot;vividior&quot; are white with some blackish spots on the larger end of the egg. Eggs of &quot;griseobarbatus&quot; are said to be white with sparse and faint markings. Eggs in eastern Brazil have been described as white. The eggs in northeastern Argentina have been described as being white and having gray or fine chestnut markings and dark lines which were concentrated at the larger end. The incubation period of the eggs is reported as being 10–16 days. Only females incubate the eggs. The nests are probably parasitized by shiny cowbirds. Eggs might also be eaten by snakes as one nest in Ecuador was observed being predated on by a snake. The nestling period is 10–13 days, and young are dependent on parents for a while after they have fledged.

== Status ==
The chivi vireo is listed as a least concern species by the IUCN. The species is common across its large range, and seems to have a stable population. The population may also be increasing locally. Also, its acceptance of disturbed habitat increases its chances of survival.

<doc id="840055" wikidata="Q618859" url="?curid=840055" title="Apocalypticism">
<text>Apocalypticism is the religious belief that the end of the world is imminent, even within one&#x27;s own lifetime. This belief is usually accompanied by the idea that civilization will soon come to a tumultuous end due to some sort of catastrophic global event.

Apocalypticism is one aspect of eschatology in certain religions, the part of theology concerned with the final events of human history, or the ultimate destiny of humanity (societal collapse, human extinction, and so on).

==Religious apocalypticism==
Religious views and movements often focus on cryptic revelations about a sudden, dramatic, and cataclysmic intervention of God in history; the judgment of humanity; the salvation of the faithful elect; and the eventual rule of the elect with God in a renewed heaven and earth. Arising initially in Zoroastrianism, apocalypticism was developed more fully in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic eschatological speculation.

==Esoteric aspects==
Apocalypticism is often conjoined with the belief that esoteric knowledge will likely be revealed in a major confrontation between good and evil forces, destined to change the course of history. Apocalypses can be viewed as good, evil, ambiguous or neutral, depending on the particular religion or belief system promoting them. However, it is not exclusively a religious idea and there are end times or transitional scenarios based in modern science, technology, political discourse, and conspiracy theories.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Christianity===


Most scholars participating in the third quest for the historical Jesus believe that Jesus was an eschatological prophet who believed the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; was coming within his own lifetime or within the lifetime of his contemporaries. Simultaneously, some of these scholars tend to see Jesus&#x27;s predictions as mistaken although some others view it from the perspective of the conditional nature of judgement prophecy. A number of interpretations of the term &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; have thus appeared in its eschatological context, e.g., apocalyptic, realized or inaugurated eschatologies, yet no consensus has emerged among scholars. The major focus for Jesus&#x27;s eschatological teachings in the Gospels is the Olivet Discourse in Mark 13, where &quot;Jesus speaks as if Peter, James, and John will personally experience the parousia.&quot; In the Gospel of Matthew, the major focus for Jesus&#x27;s eschatological teachings is in Matthew . Many scholars point to Jesus&#x27; association with John the Baptist as confirmation for his apocalyptic intentions.

Paul the Apostle states in his letters to the early Christian communities in Asia Minor that he expects to be alive when the end of the world comes, and this passage in 1 Thessalonians is often cited as proof, although its interpretation is disputed. In contrast, other passages in the Pauline epistles are seen as describing the nearness of the &quot;parousia&quot; whether or not Paul himself will live to see it. However, these statements find tensions with other New Testament passages, conflicting with texts which form the basis for later Christian apocalyptic theology. This includes a passage from the apocalyptic discourse of Matthew 24, where Jesus states &quot;only the Father&quot; knows of the hour of the coming of the Son of Man. While later Christians favor Matthew 24 over Mark 13, modern critical scholars recognize this contradiction as evidence of shifting Christian belief. This is a shift that suggests the apocalyptic moment will occur at a later date, not in the lifetime of Jesus&#x27; followers. On the other hand, N.T. Wright observes that Paul&#x27;s eschatology develops in his later epistles, after turbulent experiences in Ephesus, that he would probably not see the Second Coming in his lifetime. Wright argues that this shift was due to perspective and not belief.

This view, generally known as &quot;consistent eschatology&quot;, was influential during the early to the mid-20th century and continues to be influential today in proposed portraits of the historical Jesus. However, C. H. Dodd and others have insisted on a &quot;realized eschatology&quot;, based on the belief that the ministry of Jesus had fulfilled prophetic hopes. Many conservative scholars have adopted the paradoxical position that the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; describes a kingdom that is both &quot;present&quot; and &quot;still to come&quot;, claiming Pauline eschatology as support. While the notion of an apocalyptic Jesus remains a mainstream view among scholars, it has been challenged by proponents of other portraits. Scholars of the Jesus Seminar have rejected the historicity of Jesus&#x27; apocalyptic expectations, arguing that the evidence for it in the Gospels is largely tied to the discourses of Jesus on the &quot;Son of Man&quot;, which they do not consider to be historical; they further attribute the apocalyptic expectations of the early Church as emerging from their belief in the resurrection of Jesus, where resurrection was tied to eschatological expectations in Jewish theology. Some argued that the earlier traditions in the Q Source and Gospel of Thomas showed that apocalyptic eschatology was not present in earlier layers of the Jesus tradition. The approach by the Jesus Seminar is not short of many critics.
Recent scholarship has re-evaluated the apocalyptic ideas in the early Christian gospels not as a literal timetable or prediction of the end times, but as relating to the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 AD, and the wider cosmic importance that the Temple had for Jews that would warrant apocalyptic language among diasporic Jewish communities in the Roman Empire. For ancient Jews, the Temple was treated as a symbolic or even literal meeting point between Heaven and Earth, thereby its destruction would have wider cosmic consequences. Similarly, apocalyptic language was used throughout the Hebrew Bible to describe political and historical catastrophes, and not the end of the world. Thus, scholars such as R.T. France and N.T. Wright argue that the Gospels use apocalyptic language borrowed from the Old Testament to describe the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, and passages such as Mark concerning the &quot;coming&quot; of the Son of Man (as described in Daniel 7) are not about the Second Coming, but rather about the vindication and enthronement of the Son of Man at the Right Hand of God, where he is bestowed new authority with the Temple&#x27;s destruction. This interpretation goes back to the 18th-century scholar John Gill that the &quot;coming of the Son of Man&quot; sayings in Matthew 24, for example, were allegory for God&#x27;s judgement on the Jews for their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah and not his Second Coming, which is instead the subject in Matthew 25 for the far future. Wright argues specifically that the apocalyptic imagery in Mark 13 was written as a vindication of Jesus, since &quot;in some sense he is himself seen by the evangelists as the true temple.&quot; Similarly, these and other scholars argue for a &quot;now and not yet&quot; approach to the Kingdom of God in the Gospels and Pauline epistles.

Various Christian eschatological systems have developed among different Christian denominations throughout the history of Christianity, providing different frameworks for understanding the timing and nature of apocalyptic predictions. Some like dispensational premillennialism tend more toward an apocalyptic vision, while others like postmillennialism and amillennialism, while teaching that the end of the world could come at any moment, tend to focus on the present life and contend that one should not attempt to predict when the end should come, though there have been exceptions such as postmillennialist Jonathan Edwards, who estimated that the end times would occur around the year 2000.

====Year 1000====


There is no current consensus among historians about widespread apocalypticism in the year 1000. Richard Landes, Johannes Fried, and others think there were widespread expectations, both hopes and fears. The notion of a widespread expectation of the year 1000 first appeared during the Renaissance. Historians denounced it as a myth around 1900.

There are many recorded instances of both fascination with the advent of the year 1000, and examples of apocalyptic excitement leading up to the year 1000, the most explicit and revealing examples provided by Rodulfus Glaber.

Specifically in Western Europe, during the year 1000, Christian philosophers held many debates on when Jesus was actually born and the debates continue to today. This caused confusion between the common people on whether or not the apocalypse would occur at a certain time. Because both literate and illiterate people commonly accepted this idea of the apocalypse, they could only accept what they heard from religious leaders on when the disastrous event would occur. Religious leader Abbo of Fleury believed that Jesus was born 21 years after year 1 which was commonly accepted by close circles of his followers. Abbot Heriger of Lobbes, argued that the birth of Jesus occurred not during the year 1 but rather during the 42nd year of the common era. Eventually many scholars came to accept that the apocalypse would occur sometime between 979–1042. Under the influence of the Sibylline Oracles and figures such as Otto III and Abbot Adso of Montier-en-Der many felt that the apocalypse would soon occur.

Some historians, such as Richard Landes, think there were extensive apocalyptic expectations at the approach of the year 1000 and again at the approach of 1000 &quot;anno passionis&quot; (1033). Alessandro Barbero, on the other hand, claims that the fear of the year 1000 is a myth and there was no widespread apocalyptic sentiment. As evidence, he cites that on 31 December 999 Pope Sylvester II granted certain privileges and guarantees to the Abbey of Fulda, without any indication that either the pope or the abbot believed that the world was soon to end. Similarly, Barbero points out a document from 3 October 999 in which Otto III grants future concessions to Farfa Abbey. Another document in 999 shows two brothers taking a 29-year loan on lands of the abbey of San Marciano in Tortona, suggesting that even common people did not believe the world was ending. On the other hand, the fact that Otto III visited the tomb of Charlemagne, the emperor of the year 6000 (Annus Mundi) on Pentecost of the year 1000 suggests that even the man who appointed Sylvester pope, had his own views on the matter.

====Fifth Monarchy Men====
The Fifth Monarchists or Fifth Monarchy Men were an extreme Puritan sect active from 1649 to 1660 during the Interregnum, following the English Civil Wars of the 17th century. They took their name from a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman) would precede the kingdom of Christ. They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical Number of the Beast indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings. They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time.

====Isaac Newton and the end of the world in 2060====
In late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060. The story garnered vast amounts of public interest and found its way onto the front page of several widely distributed newspapers, including the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Canada&#x27;s &quot;National Post&quot;, and Israel&#x27;s &quot;Maariv&quot; and &quot;Yediot Aharonot&quot;, and was also featured in an article in the scientific journal &quot;Canadian Journal of History&quot;.

The two documents detailing this prediction are currently housed within the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem. Both were believed to be written toward the end of Newton&#x27;s life, circa 1705, a time frame most notably established by the use of the full title of &quot;Sir&quot; Isaac Newton within portions of the documents.

These documents do not appear to have been written with the intention of publication and Newton expressed a strong personal dislike for individuals who provided specific dates for the Apocalypse purely for sensational value. Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents. See Isaac Newton&#x27;s religious views for more details.

The first document, part of the Yahuda collection, is a small letter slip, on the back of which is written haphazardly in Newton&#x27;s hand:
The second reference to the 2060 prediction can be found in a folio, in which Newton writes:
Newton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian and Islamic theology this concept is often referred to as The Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth. In a separate manuscript, Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:
====Millerism and The Great Disappointment====

The Great Disappointment in the Millerite movement was the reaction that followed Baptist preacher William Miller&#x27;s proclamations that Jesus Christ would return to the Earth by 1844, what he called the Advent. His study of the Daniel 8 prophecy during the Second Great Awakening led him to the conclusion that Daniel&#x27;s &quot;cleansing of the sanctuary&quot; was cleansing of the world from sin when Christ would come, and he and many others prepared, but October 22, 1844 came and they were disappointed.

These events paved the way for the Adventists who formed the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They contended that what had happened on October 22 was not Jesus&#x27;s return, as Miller had thought, but the start of Jesus&#x27;s final work of atonement, the cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary, leading up to the Second Coming of Christ.

====Seventh-day Adventism====
The ideological descendants of the Millerites are the Seventh-day Adventists. They are a Protestant Christian denomination which is distinguished by its observance of Saturday, the seventh day of the week in both the Jewish calendar, and calendars in use in the Christian world (such as the Gregorian calendar), as the Sabbath, and its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming (advent) of Jesus Christ. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and it was formally established in 1863. Among its founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the adherents of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

====Mormonism====

Like many 19th-century American Restorationist Christian denominations, the Mormon tradition teaches that adherents are living shortly before the Second Coming of Christ. The term &quot;latter days&quot; is used in the official names of several Mormon churches, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. LDS president Wilford Woodruff preached multiple times that many then-living adherents &quot;would not taste death&quot; before witnessing the return of Christ. According to LDS Church teachings, the true gospel will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming. Church members believe that there will be increasingly severe wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other man-made and natural disasters prior to the Second Coming.

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====

The eschatology of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is central to their faith and religious beliefs. They believe that Jesus Christ has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe was prophesied in Scripture), and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred, resulting in God&#x27;s selection of the Bible Students associated with Charles Taze Russell to be his people in 1919. They also believe the destruction of those who reject their message and thus willfully refuse to obey God will shortly take place at Armageddon, ensuring that the beginning of the new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.

The group&#x27;s doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic claims regarding the years 1799, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918 and 1925 made in the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s publications between 1879 and 1924. Claims about the significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the beginning of the &quot;last days&quot;, the destruction of worldly governments and the earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned. In 1922 the society&#x27;s principal journal, &quot;Watch Tower&quot;, described its chronology as &quot;no stronger than its weakest link&quot;, but also claimed the chronological relationships to be &quot;of divine origin and divinely corroborated...in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct&quot; and &quot;indisputable facts&quot;, while repudiation of Russell&#x27;s teachings was described as &quot;equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord&quot;.

The Watch Tower Society has stated that its early leaders promoted &quot;incomplete, even inaccurate concepts&quot;. The Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible. Witness publications say that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who did not understand the meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower publications often cite Proverbs 4:18, &quot;The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established&quot; (NWT) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during &quot;the time of the end&quot;, as mentioned in Daniel 12:4. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses state that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God&#x27;s Kingdom and that they do not call their core beliefs into question.

====Christadelphians====
For Christadelphians, Armageddon marks the &quot;great climax of history when the nations would be gathered together &quot;into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon&quot;, and the judgment on them would herald the setting up of the Kingdom of God.&quot; After this Christadelphians believe that Jesus will return to the earth in person to set up the Kingdom of God in fulfilment of the promises made to Abraham and David. This includes the belief that the coming Kingdom will be the restoration of God&#x27;s first Kingdom of Israel, which was under David and Solomon. For Christadelphians, this is the focal point of the gospel taught by Jesus and the apostles.

====Realized eschatology====
Realized eschatology is a Christian eschatological theory popularized by J. A. T. Robinson, Joachim Jeremias, Ethelbert Stauffer (1902–1979), and 
C. H. Dodd (1884–1973), that holds that the eschatological passages in the New Testament do not refer to the future, but instead refer to the ministry of Jesus and his lasting legacy. Eschatology is therefore not the end of the world but its rebirth instituted by Jesus and continued by his disciples, a historical (rather than transhistorical) phenomenon. Those holding this view generally dismiss end times theories, believing them to be irrelevant; they hold that what Jesus said and did, and told his disciples to do likewise, are of greater significance than any messianic expectations.

====Harold Camping====
American Christian radio host Harold Camping stated that the Rapture and Judgment Day would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would take place five months later on October 21, 2011, based on adding the 153 fish of John 20 to May 21. The Rapture, as indicated in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 ( , &quot;rapture&quot; derivable from the Latin translation ) is the taking up of believers to a meeting in the air with the Lord Jesus, but for Camping the rapture was also associated with the End of the World.

Camping, who was then president of the Family Radio Christian network, claimed the Bible as his source and said May 21 would be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment &quot;beyond the shadow of a doubt&quot;. Camping suggested that it would occur at 6 pm local time, with the Rapture sweeping the globe time zone by time zone, while some of his supporters claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 3% of the world&#x27;s population) would be raptured. Camping had previously claimed that the Rapture would occur in September 1994.

The vast majority of Christian groups, including most Protestant and Catholic believers, did not accept Camping&#x27;s predictions; some explicitly rejected them, citing Bible passages including the words of Jesus stating &quot;about that day or hour no one knows&quot; (Matthew 24:36). An interview with a group of church leaders noted that all of them had scheduled church services as usual for Sunday, May 22.

Following the failure of the prediction, media attention shifted to the response from Camping and his followers. On May 23, Camping stated that May 21 had been a &quot;spiritual&quot; day of judgment, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God. However, on October 16, Camping admitted to an interviewer that he did not know when the end would come.

In March 2012, Camping &quot;humbly acknowledged&quot; in a letter to Family Radio listeners that he had been mistaken, that the attempt to predict a date was &quot;sinful&quot;, and that critics had been right in pointing to the scriptural text &quot;of that day and hour knoweth no man&quot;. He added that he was searching the Bible &quot;even more fervently [...] not to find dates, but to be more faithful in our understanding.&quot;

====David Meade====
David Meade is the pen name of an American end-times conspiracy theorist and book author who has yet to disclose his real name. Meade, who describes himself as a &quot;Christian numerologist&quot;, claims to have attended the University of Louisville, where he &quot;studied astronomy, among other subjects&quot;, but, because his real name is unknown, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the university could not confirm whether he had ever been a student there. He is also a writer, researcher and investigator who has written and self-published at least 13 books. He made appearances and interviews on &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot;, YouTube with pastor Paul Begley, and the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. He is best known for making numerous predictions, which have passed, regarding the end times, including that a hidden planet named Nibiru (sometimes known as Planet X) would destroy the Earth.

Meade predicted that planet Nibiru would collide with Earth on September 23, 2017, destroying it. After his prediction failed, he revised the apocalypse to October, where he stated that the seven-year tribulation would possibly start followed by a millennium of peace. In 2018, Meade again made several predictions for that year, for instance, that North Korea becoming a superpower in March 2018 and that Nibiru would destroy the Earth in spring. Meade announced that the apocalypse would begin in March 2018, but he did not predict the exact date. After March 2018 passed, he moved the apocalypse to April 23, 2018, in which he also predicted the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Virgo will signal the rapture, and that Nibiru would destroy the Earth that day. However, before that date he said that reports that he predicted the end on 23 April were &quot;fake news&quot;, but that the rapture—but not the end of the world—would take place on an unspecified date between May and December 2018.

====Branch Davidians====
The Branch Davidians (also known as The Branch) are a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism among the Shepherd&#x27;s Rod/Davidians. The Branch group was initially led by Benjamin Roden. Branch Davidians are most associated with the Waco siege of 1993, which involved David Koresh. There is documented evidence (FBI negotiation transcripts between Kathryn Shroeder and Steve Schneider with interjections from Koresh himself) that David Koresh and his followers did not call themselves Branch Davidians. In addition, David Koresh, through forgery, stole the identity of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists for the purpose of obtaining the Mount Carmel Center property. The doctrinal beliefs of the Branch Davidians differ on teachings such as the Holy Spirit and his nature, and the feast days and their requirements. Both groups have disputed the relevance of the other&#x27;s spiritual authority based on the proceedings following Victor Houteff&#x27;s death. From its inception in 1930, the Davidians/Shepherd&#x27;s Rod group believed themselves to be living in a time when biblical prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ&#x27;s Second Coming.

In the late 1980s, Koresh and his followers abandoned many Branch Davidian teachings. Koresh became the group&#x27;s self-proclaimed final prophet. &quot;Koreshians&quot; were the majority resulting from the schism among the Branch Davidians, but some of the Branch Davidians did not join Koresh&#x27;s group and instead gathered around George Roden or became independent. Following a series of violent shootouts between Roden&#x27;s and Koresh&#x27;s group, the Mount Carmel compound was eventually taken over by the &quot;Koreshians&quot;. In 1993, the ATF and Texas Army National Guard raided one of the properties belonging to a new religious movement centered around David Koresh that evolved from the Branch Davidians for suspected weapons violations. It is unknown who shot first, but the ATF surrounded and tried to invade the home of the Branch Davidians. This raid resulted in a two-hour firefight in which four ATF agents were killed; this was followed by a standoff with government agents that lasted for 51 days. The siege ended in a fire that engulfed the Mount Carmel compound which led to the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians inside.

===Islam===

Islamic eschatology is the aspect of Islamic theology concerning ideas of life after death, matters of the soul, and the &quot;Day of Judgement,&quot; known as (, , &quot;the Day of Resurrection&quot;) or &quot;Yawm ad-Dīn&quot; (, , &quot;the Day of Judgment&quot;). The Day of Judgement is characterized by the annihilation of all life, which will then be followed by the resurrection of the dead and judgment by God. It is not specified when will happen, but according to prophecy elaborated by hadith literature, there are major and minor signs that will foretell its coming. Multiple verses in the Qur&#x27;an mention the Last Judgment.

The main subject of Surat al-Qiyama is the resurrection. The Great Tribulation is described in the hadith and commentaries of the ulama, including al-Ghazali, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Majah, Muhammad al-Bukhari, and Ibn Khuzaymah. The Day of Judgment is also known as the Day of Reckoning, the Last Day, and the Hour (&quot;al-sā&#x27;ah&quot;).

Unlike the Quran, the hadith contains several events, happening before the Day of Judgment, which are described as several &quot;minor signs&quot; and twelve &quot;major signs&quot;. During this period, terrible corruption and chaos would rule the earth, caused by the Masih ad-Dajjal (the Antichrist in Islam), then Jesus will appear, defeating the Dajjal and establish a period of peace, liberating the world from cruelty. These events will be followed by a time of serenity when people live according to religious values.

Similarly to other Abrahamic religions, Islam teaches that there will be a resurrection of the dead that will be followed by a final tribulation and eternal division of the righteous and wicked. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing Armageddon is often known as &quot;fitna&quot;, &quot;Al-Malhama Al-Kubra&quot; (The Great Massacre) or &quot;ghaybah&quot; in Shī&#x27;a Islam. The righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of Jannah (Paradise), while the unrighteous are punished in Jahannam (Hell).

===Judaism===

Moses of Crete, a rabbi in the 5th century, claimed to be the Jewish Messiah and promised to lead the people, like the ancient Moses, through a parted sea back to Palestine. His followers left their possessions and waited for the promised day, when, at his command, many cast themselves into the sea, some finding death, others being rescued by sailors.

==Ancient Norse religion==


Ragnarök is an important eschatological event in the Ancient Norse religion and its mythology, and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory in the history of Germanic studies and is attested primarily in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, composed in the 13th century by the Icelandic scholar, lawspeaker, and historian Snorri Sturluson. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and in a single poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the event is referred to as or , respectively), a usage popularised by 19th-century composer Richard Wagner with the title of the last of his &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; operas, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (1876), which is &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; in German. There are various theories and interpretations of Ragnarök.

===Cyclic time and &quot;Hoddmímis holt&quot;===
Rudolf Simek theorizes that the survival of Líf and Lífþrasir at the end of Ragnarök is &quot;a case of reduplication of the anthropogeny, understandable from the cyclic nature of the Eddic eschatology&quot;. Simek says that Hoddmímis holt &quot;should not be understood literally as a wood or even a forest in which the two keep themselves hidden, but rather as an alternative name for the world-tree Yggdrasill. Thus, the creation of mankind from tree trunks (Askr, Embla) is repeated after the Ragnarök as well&quot;. Simek says that in Germanic regions, the concept of mankind originating from trees is ancient, and additionally points out legendary parallels in a Bavarian legend of a shepherd who lives inside a tree, whose descendants repopulate the land after life there has been wiped out by plague (citing a retelling by F. R. Schröder). In addition, Simek points to an Old Norse parallel in the figure of Örvar-Oddr, &quot;who is rejuvenated after living as a tree-man (&quot;Ǫrvar-Odds saga&quot; 24–27)&quot;.

===, , and Christianity===
Theories have been proposed about the relation between Ragnarök and the 9th-century Old High German epic poem &quot;Muspilli&quot; about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word appears, and the 9th-century Old Saxon epic poem &quot;Heliand&quot; about the life of Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify the end of the world through fire. Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of Ragnarök, where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about the meaning and origins of the term, its etymology has not been solved.

===Proto-Indo-European basis===
Parallels have been pointed out between the Ragnarök of Norse religion and the beliefs of other related Proto-Indo-European peoples. Subsequently, theories have been put forth that Ragnarök represents a later evolution of a Proto-Indo-European belief along with other cultures descending from the Proto-Indo-Europeans. These parallels include comparisons of a cosmic winter motif between the Norse Fimbulwinter, the Iranian &quot;Bundahishn&quot; and Yima. Víðarr&#x27;s stride has been compared to the Vedic god Vishnu in that both have a &quot;cosmic stride&quot; with a special shoe used to tear apart a beastly wolf. Larger patterns have also been drawn between &quot;final battle&quot; events in Indo-European cultures, including the occurrence of a blind or semi-blind figure in &quot;final battle&quot; themes, and figures appearing suddenly with surprising skills.

===Volcanic eruptions===
Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that the events in &quot;Völuspá&quot; occurring after the death of the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr&#x27;s name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland.
Parallels have been pointed out between a poem spoken by a &quot;jötunn&quot; found in the 13th-century þáttr &quot;Bergbúa þáttr&quot; (&quot;the tale of the mountain dweller&quot;). In the tale, Thórd and his servant get lost while traveling to church in winter, and so take shelter for the night within a cave. Inside the cave they hear noises, witness a pair of immense burning eyes, and then the being with burning eyes recites a poem of 12 stanzas. The poem the being recites contains references to Norse mythology (including a mention of Thor) and also prophecies (including that &quot;mountains will tumble, the earth will move, men will be scoured by hot water and burned by fire&quot;). Surtr&#x27;s fire receives a mention in stanza 10. John Lindow says that the poem may describe &quot;a mix of the destruction of the race of giants and of humans, as in Ragnarök&quot; but that &quot;many of the predictions of disruption on earth could also fit the volcanic activity that is so common in Iceland.&quot;

===Modern influences===
In late 2013 and early 2014, English-language media outlets widely reported that Ragnarök was foretold to occur on 22 February 2014. Apparently patterned after the 2012 phenomenon, the claim was at times attributed to a &quot;Viking Calendar&quot;. No such calendar is known to have existed, and the source was a &quot;prediction&quot; made to media outlets by the Jorvik Viking Centre in York, England, intended to draw attention to an event that the institution was to hold on that date. The Jorvik Viking Centre was criticized for misleading the public to promote the event. In a 2014 article on the claims, philologist Joseph S. Hopkins perceives the media response as an example of a broad revival of interest in the Viking Age and ancient Germanic topics.

==Mayan calendar and the year 2012==
The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala.

Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum, an interaction between Earth and the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, or Earth&#x27;s collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru.

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Maya history and culture, while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience, easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.

==UFO religions==

UFO religions sometimes feature an anticipated end-time scenario in which extraterrestrial beings will bring about a radical change on Earth and/or &quot;lift&quot; the religious believers to a higher plane of existence. One such religious group&#x27;s failed expectations of such an event, the Seekers, served as the basis for the classic social psychology research on cognitive dissonance conducted by the American psychologists Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter and published in their book &quot;When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World&quot; (1956). Some adherents of UFO religions believe that the arrival or rediscovery of alien civilizations, technologies, and spirituality will enable human beings to overcome current ecological, spiritual, political, and social problems on planet Earth. Issues such as hatred, war, bigotry, poverty, and so on are said to be resolvable through the use of superior alien technology and spiritual abilities. Such belief systems are also described as millenarian in their outlook. In the late 1990s, religious scholar Andreas Grünschloß applied the term &quot;cargoism&quot; to adherents of UFO religions regarding their millenarian beliefs about the arrival of intelligent aliens on technologically advanced spacecrafts on planet Earth, in comparison to the Melanesian islanders&#x27;s faith in the return of John Frum carrying the cargo with him on the islands.

==Zoroastrianism==

The Zoroastrian eschatological ideas are only alluded to in the surviving texts of the &quot;Avesta&quot;, and are known of in detail only from the texts of Zoroastrian tradition, in particular in the 9th-century text &quot;Bundahishn&quot;. The accompanying story, as it appears in the (&quot;GBd&quot; 30.1ff), runs as follows: At the end of the &quot;third time&quot; (the first being the age of creation, the second of mixture, and the third of separation), there will be a great battle between the forces of good () and those of evil (), in which the good will triumph. On Earth, the Saoshyant will bring about a resurrection of the dead in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a last judgment through ordeal. The Airyaman and Atar will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All mankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous () it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate Angra Mainyu and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.

The narrative continues with a projection of Ahura Mazda and the six Amesha Spentas solemnizing a final act of worship (), and the preparation of &quot;parahaoma&quot; from &quot;white &quot;haoma&quot;&quot;. The righteous will partake of the , which will confer immortality upon them. Thereafter, humankind will become like the Amesha Spentas, living without food, without hunger or thirst, and without weapons (or possibility of bodily injury). The material substance of the bodies will be so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language and belong to a single nation without borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with the divine for a perpetual exaltation of God&#x27;s glory.

Although is a restoration of the time of creation, there is no return to the uniqueness of the primordial plant, animal and human; while in the beginning there was one plant, one animal and one human, the variety that had since issued would remain forever. Similarly, the host of divinities brought into existence by Ahura Mazda continue to have distinct existences, &quot;and there is no prophecy of their re-absorption into the Godhead&quot;.

<text>42nd Street is a 1933 American pre-Code musical film directed by Lloyd Bacon, with songs by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics). The film&#x27;s numbers were staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley. It stars an ensemble cast of Warner Baxter, Bebe Daniels, George Brent, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell and Ginger Rogers.

Adapted from the 1932 novel of the same name by Bradford Ropes, the film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Rian James and James Seymour, with uncredited contributions by Whitney Bolton. The story revolves around the cast and crew rehearsing for a Broadway show at the height of the Great Depression.

&quot;42nd Street&quot; was one of the most successful motion pictures of 1933, earning almost $1.5 million at the box office. At the 6th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Picture.

== Plot ==
In 1932 during the depths of the Great Depression noted Broadway producers Jones and Barry are staging &quot;Pretty Lady&quot;, a musical starring Dorothy Brock. She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon, the show&#x27;s financial backer, but she is secretly seeing her old vaudeville partner Pat Denning, who is out of work.

Julian Marsh is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is impoverished following the 1929 Stock Market Crash, so he must make his last show a hit in order to earn enough money to retire.

Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition. Newcomer Peggy Sawyer is ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming and Ann Lowell, take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee, and she assures that Ann and Peggy are chosen. Peggy is tricked into bursting into the dressing room of the show&#x27;s juvenile lead, Billy Lawler, who takes an immediate liking to her.

When Marsh learns about Dorothy&#x27;s relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy to intimidate Pat. Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. Pat takes a stock job in Philadelphia.

Rehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh&#x27;s complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show&#x27;s surprise opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning, Abner has quarreled with her and wants Marsh to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. Annie confesses that she cannot carry the show but convinces the director that the inexperienced Peggy can. Julian is desperate and rehearses Peggy mercilessly until an hour before the premiere.

Billy finally musters the nerve to tell Peggy that he loves her. They embrace and kiss, just as Dorothy appears and walks through the door. She wishes Peggy luck and reveals that she and Pat are finally getting married. The show is staged to rousing applause. As the theater audience leaves, Julian stands in the shadows outside the stage door, hearing comments that Peggy is the star and that he does not deserve the credit for the show&#x27;s success.

== Production ==
The film was Ruby Keeler&#x27;s first, and the first time that Busby Berkeley, Harry Warren and Al Dubin had worked for Warner Bros. Mervyn LeRoy, the original director, became ill and Lloyd Bacon was hired to replace him. LeRoy was dating Ginger Rogers at the time and had suggested that she take the role of Ann.

Actors who were considered for lead roles include Warren William and Richard Barthelmess for the role of Julian Marsh, eventually played by Warner Baxter; Kay Francis and Ruth Chatterton instead of Bebe Daniels for the role of Dorothy Brock; Loretta Young as Peggy Sawyer instead of Ruby Keeler; Joan Blondell instead of Ginger Rogers for Anytime Annie; Glenda Farrell for the role of Lorraine, played by Una Merkel; and Frank McHugh instead of George E. Stone as Andy.

The film began production on October 5, 1932. The shooting schedule ran for 28 days at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, California. The total production cost is estimated to have been between $340,000 and $439,000.

== Musical numbers ==

The film&#x27;s music was written by Harry Warren with lyrics by Al Dubin. The numbers were choreographed and directed by Busby Berkeley.

* &quot;You&#x27;re Getting to Be a Habit with Me&quot; – sung by Bebe Daniels
* &quot;It Must Be June&quot; – sung by Bebe Daniels, Dick Powell and the chorus
* &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot; – sung and danced by Ruby Keeler and Clarence Nordstrom, with Ginger Rogers, Una Merkel and the chorus
* &quot;Young and Healthy&quot; – sung by Dick Powell to Toby Wing and the chorus
* &quot;42nd Street&quot; – sung and danced by Ruby Keeler, and sung by Dick Powell

The &quot;Love Theme&quot;, written by Harry Warren, is played under scenes between Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and Bebe Daniels and George Brent. It has no title or lyrics and is unpublished.

The music playing during dance rehearsals and the opening of the show is an instrumental piano piece that Warren wrote titled &quot;Pretty Lady&quot;, the name of the show that is produced in the film.

== Release ==
The film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the Strand Theatre and entered general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable films of the year, earning an estimated gross of $2,300,000. According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $1,438,000 domestically and $843,000 abroad.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Mordaunt Hall called &quot;42nd Street&quot; &quot;the liveliest and one of the most tuneful screen musical comedies that has come out of Hollywood&quot; and wrote: &quot;Although it has its serious moments, it is for the most part a merry affair ... It is a film which reveals the forward strides made in this particular medium since the first screen musical features came to Broadway. Although it has its boisterous moments, &#x27;42nd Street&#x27; is invariably entertaining.&quot;

The &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; described the film as &quot;[a] sprightly entertainment, combining, as it did, a plausible enough story of back-stage life, some excellent musical numbers and dance routines and a cast of players that are considerably above the average found in screen musicals.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Every element is professional and convincing. It&#x27;ll socko the screen musical fans with the same degree that Metro&#x27;s pioneering screen musicals did.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a bright movie&quot; with &quot;as pretty a little fantasy of Broadway as you may hope to see&quot; and praised Baxter&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of the best he has given us&quot;, although he described the plot as &quot;the most conventional one to be found in such doings.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
In 1998, &quot;42nd Street&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 2006, the film was ranked #13 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the greatest musicals of all time.

A Broadway stage adaptation debuted in 1980, winning two Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed in 1960, and it will enter the American public domain on January 1, 2029.

== Stage adaptation ==

In 1980, the film was adapted into a stage musical by Harry Warren and Al Dubin. It featured additional songs by Warren and lyrics by Dubin and Johnny Mercer and a book by Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble. The original Broadway production directed and choreographed by Gower Champion (whose death on opening night was announced at the curtain call by producer David Merrick) won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Since then, it has been produced regionally and professionally around the world. The score included all musical numbers from the film except &quot;It Must Be June.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;42nd Street&quot; received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Sound and was named one of the ten best films of 1933 by &quot;Film Daily&quot;.

<text>Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael (;  1629 – 10 March 1682) was a Dutch painter, draughtsman, and etcher. He is generally considered the pre-eminent landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age, a period of great wealth and cultural achievement when Dutch painting became highly popular.

Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael depicted a wide variety of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.

Ruisdael&#x27;s only registered pupil was Meindert Hobbema, one of several artists who painted figures in his landscapes. Hobbema&#x27;s work has at times been confused with Ruisdael&#x27;s. Ruisdael always spelt his name thus: Ruisdael, not Ruysdael.

Ruisdael&#x27;s work was in demand in the Dutch Republic during his lifetime. Today it is spread across private and institutional collections around the world; the National Gallery in London, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg hold the largest collections. Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide, from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, and influenced generations of Dutch landscape artists.

==Life==
Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael was born in Haarlem in 1628 or 1629 into a family of painters, all landscapists. The number of painters in the family, and the multiple spellings of the Van Ruisdael name, have hampered attempts to document his life and attribute his works. The name Ruisdael is connected to a castle, now lost, in the village of Blaricum. The village was the home of Jacob&#x27;s grandfather, the furniture maker Jacob de Goyer. When De Goyer moved away to Naarden, three of his sons changed their name to Van Ruysdael or Van Ruisdael, probably to indicate their origin. Two of De Goyer&#x27;s sons became painters: Jacob&#x27;s father Isaack van Ruisdael and his well-known uncle Salomon van Ruysdael. Jacob himself always spelled his name with an &quot;i&quot;, while his cousin, Salomon&#x27;s son Jacob Salomonszoon van Ruysdael, also a landscape artist, spelled his name with a &quot;y&quot;. Jacob&#x27;s earliest biographer, Arnold Houbraken, called him Jakob Ruisdaal.

It is not known whether Ruisdael&#x27;s mother was Isaack van Ruisdael&#x27;s first wife, whose name is unknown, or his second wife, Maycken Cornelisdochter. Isaack and Maycken married on 12 November 1628.

Ruisdael&#x27;s teacher is also unknown. It is often assumed Ruisdael studied with his father and uncle, but there is no evidence for this. He appears to have been strongly influenced by other contemporary local Haarlem landscapists, most notably Cornelis Vroom and Allart van Everdingen.

The earliest date that appears on a Ruisdael painting and etching is 1646. Two years after this date he was admitted to membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. By this time landscape paintings were as popular as history paintings in Dutch households, though at the time of Ruisdael&#x27;s birth, history paintings appeared far more frequently. This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael&#x27;s career.

Around 1657, Ruisdael moved to Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which was likely to have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On 17 June 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael lived and worked in Amsterdam for the rest of his life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the marriage of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have, by some, been confused with Ruisdael&#x27;s own.

For a landscape artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, Egmond aan Zee, and Rhenen in the 1640s, with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and Steinfurt just across the border in Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum. Despite Ruisdael&#x27;s numerous Norwegian landscapes, there is no record of him having travelled to Scandinavia.

There is some speculation that Ruisdael was also a doctor. In 1718, his biographer Houbraken reports that he studied medicine and performed surgery in Amsterdam. Archival records of the 17th century show the name &quot;Jacobus Ruijsdael&quot; on a list of Amsterdam doctors, albeit crossed out, with the added remark that he earned his medical degree on 15 October 1676 in Caen, northern France. Various art historians have speculated that this was, in all probability, a case of mistaken identity. Pieter Scheltema suggests it was Ruisdael&#x27;s cousin who appeared on the record. The Ruisdael expert Seymour Slive argues that the spelling &quot;uij&quot; is not consistent with Ruisdael&#x27;s own spelling of his name, that his unusually high production suggests there was little time to study medicine, and that there is no indication in any of his art that he visited northern France. The evidence is inconclusive.

Ruisdael was not Jewish. Slive reports that, because of Ruisdael&#x27;s depiction of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael was buried in the Saint Bavo&#x27;s Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael&#x27;s father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.

Ruisdael did not marry. According to Houbraken, whose short biography does contain a few errors, this was &quot;to reserve time to serve his old father&quot;. No likeness of Ruisdael is known to exist 

The art historian Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved the myth that Ruisdael died a poor man, supposedly in the old men&#x27;s almshouse in Haarlem. Wijnman showed that the person who died there was in fact Ruisdael&#x27;s cousin, Jacob Salomonszoon. Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672. His paintings were valued fairly highly. In a large sample of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings. In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price-weighted frequency in these inventories, Ruisdael ranks seventh; Rembrandt ranks first.

Ruisdael died in Amsterdam on 10 March 1682. He was buried 14 March 1682 in Saint Bavo&#x27;s Church, Haarlem.

==Work==
===Early years===

Ruisdael&#x27;s work from c. 1646 to the early 1650s, when he was living in Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and laborious study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.

An exemplar of Ruisdael&#x27;s early style is &quot;Dune Landscape&quot;, one of the earliest works, dated 1646. It breaks with the classic Dutch tradition of depicting broad views of dunes that include houses and trees flanked by distant vistas. Instead, Ruisdael places tree-covered dunes prominently at centre stage, with a cloudscape concentrating strong light on a sandy path. The resulting heroic effect is enhanced by the large size of the canvas, &quot;so unexpected in the work of an inexperienced painter&quot; according to Irina Sokolova, curator at the Hermitage Museum. The art historian Hofstede de Groot said of &quot;Dune Landscape&quot;: &quot;It is hardly credible that it should be the work of a boy of seventeen&quot;.
Ruisdael&#x27;s first panoramic landscape, &quot;View of Naarden with the Church at Muiderberg in the Distance&quot;, dates from 1647. The theme of an overwhelming sky and a distant town, in this case the birthplace of his father, is one he returned to in his later years.

For unknown reasons, Ruisdael almost entirely stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five works from the 1660s have a, partially obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.

All thirteen known Ruisdael etchings come from his early period, with the first one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out &quot;Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood&quot; and &quot;The Travellers&quot; as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael&#x27;s genius.

===Middle period===

Following Ruisdael&#x27;s trip to Germany, his landscapes took on a more heroic character, with forms becoming larger and more prominent. A view of &quot;Bentheim Castle&quot;, dated 1653, is just one of a dozen of Ruisdael&#x27;s depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle&#x27;s setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are rightly considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael&#x27;s compositional skills.

On his trip to Germany, Ruisdael encountered water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. &quot;Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice&quot;, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael&#x27;s and feature in &quot;The Jewish Cemetery&quot;, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.

Ruisdael&#x27;s first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large boulders and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, they are based on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter Allart van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael&#x27;s work soon outstripped van Everdingen&#x27;s finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which &quot;Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle&quot;,  1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.

In this period Ruisdael started painting coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among the most dramatic is &quot;Rough Sea at a Jetty&quot;, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage&#x27;s most famous Ruisdael, &quot;A Wooded Marsh&quot;, dated  1665, which depicts a primieval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.

===Later years===
During Ruisdael&#x27;s last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as &quot;Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River&quot;, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael&#x27;s subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael&#x27;s work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.

The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the Picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens.
Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael&#x27;s most famous works. &quot;Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede&quot;, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting&#x27;s enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the &quot;Windmill&quot; ranking third after Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Night Watch&quot; and Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;View of Delft&quot;. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael&#x27;s entire career.

Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo&#x27;s Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.

While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years. It does feature in his only known architectural subject, a drawing of the interior of the Old Church, as well as in views of the Dam, and the &quot;Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam&quot;, one of Ruisdael&#x27;s last paintings.

Figures are introduced sparingly into Ruisdael&#x27;s compositions, and are by this period rarely from his own hand but executed by various artists, including his pupil Meindert Hobbema, Nicolaes Berchem, Adriaen van de Velde, Philips Wouwerman, Jan Vonck, Thomas de Keyser, Gerard van Battum and Jan Lingelbach.

===Attributions===

In his 2001 catalogue raisonné, Slive attributes 694 paintings to Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or, he believes, incorrect attribution. There are three main reasons why there is uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael-style landscapes. Firstly, four members of the Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures, some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob&#x27;s. This is further complicated by the fact that Ruisdael used variations of his signature. This typically reads &quot;JvRuisdael&quot; or the monogram &quot;JVR&quot;, sometimes using a small italic &#x27;s&#x27; and sometimes a Gothic long &#x27;s&#x27;, such as on &quot;Landscape with Waterfall&quot;. Secondly, many 17th-century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists. Finally, fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain, with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718: a certain Jan Griffier the Elder could imitate Ruisdael&#x27;s style so well that he often passed them off as genuine Ruisdaels, especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman. There is no large-scale systematic approach to ascertaining Ruisdael&#x27;s attributions, unlike the forensic science used to find the correct attributions of Rembrandt&#x27;s paintings through the Rembrandt Research Project.

===Legacy===

Ruisdael has shaped landscape painting traditions from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, as well as generations of Dutch landscape artists. Among the English artists influenced by Ruisdael are Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner, and John Constable. Gainsborough drew, in black chalk and grey wash, a copy of a Ruisdael in the 1740s—now both paintings are housed in the Louvre in Paris. Turner made many copies of Ruisdaels and even painted fantasy views of a nonexistent port he called &quot;Port Ruysdael&quot;. Constable also copied various drawings, etchings and paintings by Ruisdael, and was a great admirer from a young age. &quot;It haunts my mind and clings to my heart&quot;, he wrote after seeing a Ruisdael. However, he thought &quot;Jewish Cemetery&quot; was a failure, because he considered that it attempted to convey something outside the reach of art.

In the 19th century, Vincent van Gogh acknowledged Ruisdael as a major influence, calling him sublime, but at the same time saying it would be a mistake to try to copy him. Van Gogh had two Ruisdael prints, &quot;The Bush&quot; and a &quot;Haerlempje&quot;, on his wall, and thought the Ruisdaels in the Louvre were &quot;magnificent, especially &quot;The Bush&quot;, &quot;The Breakwater&quot; and &quot;The Ray of Light&quot;&quot;. His experience of the French countryside was informed by his memory of Ruisdael&#x27;s art. Van Gogh&#x27;s contemporary Claude Monet is also said to be indebted to Ruisdael. Similarly, Piet Mondrian&#x27;s early abstract compositions the eventually led to the founding of De Stijl have been traced back to Ruisdael&#x27;s panoramas.

Among art historians and critics, Ruisdael&#x27;s reputation has had its ups and downs over the centuries. The first account, in 1718, is from Houbraken, who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict falling water and the sea. In 1781, Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy, admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael&#x27;s landscapes. A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed. In 1801, Henry Fuseli, professor at the Royal Academy, expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape, dismissing it as no more than a &quot;transcript of the spot&quot;, a mere &quot;enumeration of hill and dale, clumps of trees&quot;. Of note is that one of Fuseli&#x27;s students was Constable, whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged. Around the same time in Germany, the writer, statesman and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lauded Ruisdael as a thinking artist, even a poet, saying &quot;he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind&quot;. John Ruskin however, in 1860, raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists, calling their landscapes places where &quot;we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it&quot;. In 1915, the Dutch art historian Abraham Bredius called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet.

More recent art historians have rated Ruisdael highly. Kenneth Clark described him as &quot;the greatest master of the natural vision before Constable&quot;. Waldemar Januszczak finds him a marvellous storyteller. Januszczak does not consider Ruisdael the greatest landscape artist of all time, but is especially impressed by his works as a teenager: &quot;a prodigy whom we should rank at number 8 or 9 on the Mozart scale&quot;. Slive states Ruisdael is acknowledged &quot;by general consent, as the pre-eminent landscapist of the Golden Age of Dutch art&quot;.

Ruisdael is now seen as the leading artist of the &quot;classical&quot; phase in Dutch landscape art, which built upon the realism of the previous &quot;tonal&quot; phase. The tonal phase suggested atmosphere through the use of tonality, while the classical phase strived for a more grandiose effect, with paintings built up through a series of vigorous contrasts of solid form against the sky, and of light against shade, with a tree, animal, or windmill often singled out.

Although many of Ruisdael&#x27;s works were on show in the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857, and various other grand exhibitions across the world since, it was not until 1981 that an exhibition was solely dedicated to him. Over fifty paintings and thirty-five drawings and etchings were exhibited, first at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, then, in 1982, at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2006, the Royal Academy in London hosted a Ruisdael &quot;Master of Landscape&quot; exhibition, displaying works from over fifty collections.

===Interpretation===

There are no 17th-century documents to indicate, either at first or second hand, what Ruisdael intended to convey through his art. While &quot;The Jewish Cemetery&quot; is universally accepted as an allegory for the fragility of life, how other works should be interpreted is much disputed. At one end of the spectrum is Henry Fuseli, who contends they have no meaning at all, and are simply a depiction of nature. At the other end is Franz Theodor Kugler who sees meaning in almost everything: &quot;They all display the silent power of Nature, who opposes with her mighty hand the petty activity of man, and with a solemn warning as it were, repels his encroachments&quot;.

In the middle of the spectrum are scholars such as E. John Walford, who sees the works as &quot;not so much bearers of narrative or emblematic meanings but rather as images reflecting the fact that the visible world was essentially perceived as manifesting inherent spiritual significance&quot;. Walford advocates abandoning the notion of &quot;disguised symbolism&quot;. Perhaps Ruisdael&#x27;s work can be interpreted according to the religious world view of his time: nature serves as the &quot;first book&quot; of God, both because of its inherent divine qualities and because of God&#x27;s obvious concern for man and the world. The intention is spiritual, not moral.

Andrew Graham-Dixon fancifully asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists could not help but search everywhere for meaning. He says of the windmill in &quot;The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede&quot; that it symbolises &quot;the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation&#x27;s children&quot;. The symmetries in the landscapes are &quot;reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow&quot;. Slive, sensible scholar that he is, is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put &quot;The Windmill&quot; in its contemporary religious context of man&#x27;s dependence on the &quot;spirit of the Lord for life&quot;. With regards to interpreting Ruisdael&#x27;s Scandinavian paintings, he says &quot;My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas&quot;.

===Collections===

Ruisdaels are scattered across collections globally, both private and institutional. The most notable collections are at the National Gallery in London, which holds twenty paintings; the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which holds sixteen paintings; the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, which holds nine, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, Spain has four (and two additional paintings attributed to Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael). In the US, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has five Ruisdaels in its collection, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California has three.

On occasion a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, &quot;Dunes by the Sea&quot; was auctioned at Christie&#x27;s in New York, and realised a price of $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Dresden&#x27;s Kupferstich-Kabinett, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael&#x27;s rare etchings are spread across institutions. No collection holds a print of each of the thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the Albertina in Vienna, and one is in Amsterdam.

==Context==

According to some, Ruisdael and his art should not be considered apart from the context of the incredible wealth and significant changes to the land that occurred during the Dutch Golden Age. In his study on 17th-century Dutch art and culture, Simon Schama remarks that &quot;it can never be overemphasized that the period between 1550 and 1650, when the political identity of an independent Netherlands nation was being established, was also a time of dramatic physical alteration of its landscape&quot;. Ruisdael&#x27;s depiction of nature and emergent Dutch technology are wrapped up in this. Christopher Joby places Ruisdael in the religious context of the Calvinism of the Dutch Republic. He states that landscape painting does conform to Calvin&#x27;s requirement that only what is visible may be depicted in art, and that landscape paintings such as those of Ruisdael have an epistemological value which provides further support for their use within Reformed Churches.

The art historian Yuri Kuznetsov places Ruisdael&#x27;s art in the context of the war of independence against Spain. Dutch landscape painters &quot;were called upon to make a portrait of their homeland, twice rewon by the Dutch people – first from the sea and later from foreign invaders&quot;. Jonathan Israel, in his study of the Dutch Republic, calls the period between 1647 and 1672 the third phase of Dutch Golden Age art, in which wealthy merchants wanted large, opulent and refined paintings, and civic leaders filled their town halls with grand displays containing republican messages.

As well, ordinary middle class Dutch people began buying art for the first time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master&#x27;s direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael&#x27;s case, it is not known whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.

<text>Charlotte Marie Pomeline Casiraghi (born 3 August 1986) is a Monégasque model, socialite, equestrian and journalist. She is the second child of Caroline, Princess of Hanover, and Stefano Casiraghi, an Italian industrialist. She is eleventh in line to the throne of Monaco. Her maternal grandparents were Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. She is named after her maternal great-grandmother, Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois.

==Early life==
Charlotte Casiraghi was born in Princess Grace Hospital Centre in La Colle, Monaco on 3 August 1986 to Princess Caroline of Monaco and Stefano Casiraghi. She was christened on 20 September 1986. Her godparents are Albina du Boisrouvray and Stefano Casiraghi&#x27;s brother-in-law, Massimo Bianchi. She has two brothers: Andrea (b. 1984) and Pierre (b. 1987). When she was four years old, her father was killed in a boating accident. After his death, Princess Caroline moved the family to the Midi village of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in France, with the intention of minimising their exposure to the press.

In January 1999, Charlotte gained a stepfather and two stepbrothers, (Prince Ernst of Hanover and Prince Christian of Hanover), when her mother married Ernst August, Prince of Hanover. Six months later, Casiraghi&#x27;s half-sister, Princess Alexandra of Hanover, was born at a clinic in Vöcklabruck, Austria. Casiraghi is one of the godmothers to her sister. The family then moved to the Parisian suburb of Fontainebleau.

From 2001 through 2004, as a member of Marcel Rozier&#x27;s Team Marionnaud, Casiraghi participated in a number of Junior and Amateur class show jumping competitions. She was trained by his son Thierry Rozier.

==Education==
From the ages of two to six, Casiraghi attended Les Dames de Saint Maur, which is part of the Catholic schools of François d&#x27;Assise Nicolas Barré in Monaco. At the age of six, she moved on to the &quot;École de la République&quot; (state school system) in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. From 2000 to 2004 she attended the Lycée François-Couperin, Fontainebleau.

She obtained her baccalaureate exam in July 2004 with &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. She then enrolled in the &quot;hypokhâgne&quot; and &quot;khâgne&quot; course at the Lycée Fénelon, in St-Germain-des-Près, Paris, in the hope of entering the École normale supérieure (Paris). She took the written entrance exam for ENS in June 2006, but failed to make the list of candidates eligible to proceed to the oral exam.

In 2007, Casiraghi earned a Licence de Philosophie (B.A.) from the University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne; She completed two internships, firstly with the publishing house of Robert Laffont in Paris, and then later from October 2007 with the Sunday magazine supplement of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper of London. In 2018, she told Clara Le Fort of &quot;Billionaire&quot; magazine: &quot;I continued studying philosophy while at the Sciences Po Doctoral School.&quot; Casiraghi furthered her studies at the Catholic University of Paris.

==Career==
===Fashion and modelling ===
In 2010, Casiraghi became the official ambassador for the equestrian collections of Gucci. In 2014, she became the face of Gucci Cosmetics. Casiraghi modelled for Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s campaign for its Fall 2018 collection, giving it the hashtag #YSL15. She was photographed by David Sims as the face of the campaign.

Casiraghi modeled for photographer Collier Schorr in the eighth issue of &quot;System&quot; magazine. In a gender fluid framework, she modeled clothing from the Gucci menswear line. On 22 December 2020, she became the brand ambassador of Chanel. She was the global face for Chanel&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2021 campaign.

In 2018, Casiraghi collaborated with Montblanc on a line of jewellery called &quot;Les Aimants&quot; and inspired by Nancy Cunard.

===Philosophy===
In 2015, Casiraghi founded &quot;Les Rencontres Philosophiques de Monaco&quot; (literally, &quot;Philosophical Encounters&quot;). Her co-founders include her former teacher in Fontainebleau, the philosopher Robert Maggiori. The others founders are Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Her mother is among the many honorary members of the group, a think tank on philosophy where contemporary issues and new publications in the field of philosophy are discussed. The writings and the life of Anne Dufourmantelle made a strong impact on Casiraghi, who wrote in particular about Dufourmantelle&#x27;s book &quot;Défense du Secret&quot; in an article for Libération. Casiraghi and Dufourmantelle, who died in 2017, were friends, sharing, according to Casiraghi, a passion not only for philosophy but for horses.

Casiraghi wrote the preface for a book published in 2017 by the psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva. The two women also published their letters to each other, reflecting on philosophy.

In March 2018, Casiraghi and Maggiori published their Kindle book, through Éditions du Seuil. The title is &quot;Archipel des Passions&quot; (Archipelago of the Passions). It is a series of dialogues between the professor and the student about the various passions (i.e. arrogance, joy, cruelty, love) and their affects. It is also &quot;an essay on the passion of thought.&quot; The book is dedicated to her father and explores around 40 passions.

===Equestrianism===
In June 2009, Casiraghi, accompanied by her uncle Albert II, Prince of Monaco, appeared on the French television programme Stade 2 to speak about her recent enrollment in the Global Champions Tour.

Since returning to the show jumping sport in April 2009 (after a four-year hiatus), she continues to train with Thierry Rozier. Casiraghi and the bay gelding named GI Joe (owner: Jan Tops), participated in the 2009 Global Champions Tour in Valencia, Monte Carlo, Cannes, Estoril, Rio de Janeiro, and Valkenswaard.

Casiraghi continued participation in the Global Champions Tour throughout 2010. For the most part, she rode horses Troy (a chestnut stallion) and Tintero (a grey gelding). The GCT &quot;Pro-Am Cup&quot; (Professional-Amateur) relay was her original concept. It is a staple of the GCT Monaco event to this day.

In 2010, she assumed the role of honorary president of the Global Champions Tour (now the Longines Global Champions Tour) in Monaco; her mother had been honorary president of the event as it existed prior to its inclusion in the Global Champions Tour. Since 2015, Casiraghi has not taken part in multiple phases of the Longines Global Champions Tour, and reduced her participation to the Monaco phase only.

===Journalism===
Casiraghi is a published writer and magazine editor. Her credits include work for AnOther Magazine (its issue for January 2008) and the Sunday supplement to the British The Independent newspaper in the late months of 2007. She was the editor-at-large for &quot;Above&quot; magazine in 2009. With two friends, she left that role in order to focus on the founding of the ecological/fashion-related &quot;Ever Manifesto&quot;.

Through her work as the editor-at-large for &quot;Above&quot; magazine, Casiraghi befriended Stella McCartney, whom she interviewed for the magazine&#x27;s first issue. McCartney enlightened Casiraghi and readers as to the many ways the fashion industry can harm the ecosystem. Also for &quot;Above&quot;, Casiraghi was reported in Women&#x27;s Wear Daily as being &quot;instrumental in securing an interview with &quot;Gomorrah&quot; author Roberto Saviano (which took place in hiding thanks to Saviano&#x27;s dissection of the Mafia).&quot;

On 21 September 2009, Casiraghi announced plans to publish 3,000 copies of &quot;Ever Manifesto,&quot; a free publication on what she considers the fashion industry&#x27;s harmful impact on the global environment and to promote sustainability in fashion. She revealed that her collaborators with the Loro Piana-funded project are the socialite Alexia Niedzielski and advertising executive Elizabeth von Guttman. She also revealed that the environmentally conscious designer Stella McCartney, as well as her own uncle Prince Albert II, greatly enlightened and influenced her. Specifically, she said in 2013: &quot;It&#x27;s only recently that I&#x27;ve questioned the way that I&#x27;ve been consuming. I haven&#x27;t been as conscious as I should have been.&quot;

The debut issue of &quot;Ever Manifesto&quot; was distributed free at the 10 Corso Como boutique during Milan Fashion Week and again at Colette in Paris during Paris Fashion Week. Casiraghi explained that the magazine will not have a predetermined publication schedule. &quot;We want to publish when we have something to say or people to support,&quot; she said. &quot;It will be short and meaningful so that people will read it.&quot;

The day after the publication of her &quot;La Stampa&quot; interview, 22 September, Casiraghi joined her partners, Niedzielski and Guttman, at the gallery of Michelangelo Pistoletto, in the town of Biella, in the Italian region of Piedmont. Along with the artist and the Vogue Italia editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, she unveiled plans for &quot;Ever Manifesto&quot; and the Città dell&#x27;arte Fashion: Bio Ethical Sustainable Trend.

In October 2009, Casiraghi was a guest at the Stella McCartney show in Paris. Sitting in the front row with Dasha Zhukova, Paul McCartney and Gwyneth Paltrow, she told Women&#x27;s Wear Daily about &quot;Ever Manifesto&quot;. Copies of the magazine&#x27;s first issue were left on the seats before the show. &quot;We will announce [succeeding issues] on the website soon,&quot; she said.

Casiraghi contributed to the October 2009 issue of &quot;20&quot;, the free newspaper of Alex Dellal&#x27;s gallery, 20 Hoxton Square Projects.

===Film===
Casiraghi founded Swoon Productions in 2012 that focused on equestrian films. In 2014, she bought the rights to the book &quot;Our Lady of the Nile&quot;, which was released as a feature film in 2020, in which she was one of the producers.

== Philanthropy ==
Casiraghi is a private citizen, but occasionally attends official functions in Monaco, such as a fundraising gala for AMADE Mondiale and Nelson Mandela&#x27;s foundation in September 2007. In 2006, she made her debut appearance at Monaco&#x27;s Rose Ball (in French: &quot;Bal de la Rose&quot;), which also raises money for the Princess Grace Foundation. In 2015, she joined the board of directors of FXB France, an organization founded by her godmother Albina du Boisrouvray in 1989 to combat AIDS and poverty.

As a child, she was Monegasque delegate to the &quot;Club des Habits Rouges&quot;. At the same time, her grandfather Rainier III, Prince of Monaco designated her patron of the Public Safety Division in Monaco. In 2024, she was named as a Knight of the Order of Cultural Merit ( Monaco)

==Personal life==
At the age of 16, Casiraghi was named number ten on a list of the world&#x27;s most eligible young women. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; selected Casiraghi as one of the International Best Dressed List of 2006.

Casiraghi is often photographed at fashion shows, art exhibits, and equestrian events.

In December 2011, Casiraghi started dating stand-up comedian and actor Gad Elmaleh. Their son, Raphaël, was born on Tuesday, 17 December 2013. As Raphaël&#x27;s parents were not married, he is not included in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. The couple split in June 2015.

In March 2018, several credible media sources reported Casiraghi&#x27;s engagement to Dimitri Rassam, the son of French actress Carole Bouquet, and it was widely noted that she wore a diamond ring at Monaco&#x27;s Rose Ball on 24 March. She was visibly pregnant by the summer and the couple chose to postpone a wedding until after the birth of their child. On 23 October 2018, she gave birth to a second child, a son named Balthazar. The couple married civilly at the Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco on 1 June 2019. They celebrated in a reception at the nearby Villa La Vigie in Roquebrune. On 29 June 2019, they married religiously at the Abbey of Sainte-Marie de Pierredon, outside Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

<text>A minority religion is a religion held by a minority of the population of state or which is otherwise politically marginalized. Minority religions may be subject to stigma or discrimination. An example of a stigma is using the term cult with its extremely negative connotations for certain new religious movements. People who belong to a minority religion may be subject to discrimination and prejudice, especially when the religious differences correlate with ethnic differences.

Laws are made in some countries to protect the rights of religious minorities, such as protecting the minorities&#x27; culture and to promote harmony with the majority.

<text>Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem (1 October 1620 – 18 February 1683) was a highly esteemed and prolific Dutch Golden Age painter of pastoral landscapes, populated with mythological or biblical figures, but also of a number of allegories and genre pieces.

He was a member of the second generation of &quot;Dutch Italianate landscape&quot; painters. These were artists who travelled to Italy, or aspired to, in order to soak up the romanticism of the country, bringing home sketchbooks full of drawings of classical ruins and pastoral imagery. 

His paintings, of which he produced an immense number, (Hofstede de Groot claimed around 850, although many are misattributed), were in great demand, as were his 80 etchings and 500 drawings. His landscapes, painted in the Italian style of idealized rural scenes, with hills, mountains, cliffs and trees in a golden dawn are sought after. Berchem also painted inspired and attractive human and animal figures (staffage) in works of other artists, like Allaert van Everdingen, Jan Hackaert, Gerrit Dou, Meindert Hobbema and Willem Schellinks.

==Biography==
Born in Haarlem, he received instruction from his father Pieter Claesz, and from the painters Jan van Goyen, Pieter de Grebber, Jan Baptist Weenix, Jan Wils and Claes Cornelisz. Moeyaert. According to Houbraken, Carel de Moor told him that Berchem got his name from two words &quot;Berg hem&quot; for &quot;Save him!&quot;, an expression used by his fellows in Van Goyen&#x27;s workshop whenever his father chased him there with the intent to beat him. No trip or Grand Tour by Berchem was documented by Houbraken though he mentioned another story about the &quot;Berg hem!&quot; nickname which came from Berchem&#x27;s conscription as a sailor; the man in charge of impressment knew him and sent him ashore with the words &quot;Save him!&quot;. Today his name is assumed to come from his father&#x27;s hometown of Berchem, Antwerp. According to the RKD he traveled to Italy with Jan Baptist Weenix, whom he called his cousin, in 1642–1645. Works by him are signed both as &quot;CBerghem&quot; and &quot;Berchem&quot;.

In 1645 he became a member of the Dutch reformed church and married the year after. According to Houbraken he married the daughter of the painter Jan Wils, who kept him on a short allowance, but to finance his collection of prints he would borrow money from his pupils and colleagues and pay them back from the proceeds of paintings that he didn&#x27;t tell her about. Around 1650 he travelled to Westphalia with Jacob van Ruisdael, where a dated piece showing Burg Bentheim is recorded. Maybe Berchem went to Italy after this trip and before he moved to Amsterdam – he is not clearly documented in the Netherlands between 1650 and 1656. Around 1660 he worked for the engraver Jan de Visscher designing an atlas. From 1661 to 1670 he is registered in Amsterdam and in 1670 he moved back to Haarlem, but was living back in Amsterdam by 1677, where he died in 1683.

He was a popular teacher and his pupils were Abraham Begeyn, Johannes van der Bent, his son Nicolaes, Isaack Croonenbergh, Simon Dubois, Karel Dujardin, Johannes Glauber, Pieter de Hooch, Jacob van Huchtenburg, Justus van Huysum, Dirk Maas, Hendrick Mommers, Jacob Ochtervelt, Willem Romeyn and possibly Jan Frans Soolmaker. He was the uncle of Govert van der Leeuw and his brother Pieter.

The French Rococo painter Jean-Baptiste Pillement was influenced by his works, as was the Dutch &#x27;Cleves Romanticism&#x27; landscape painter, Barend Cornelis Koekkoek.
