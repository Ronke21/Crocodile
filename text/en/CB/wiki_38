<text>A golden handshake is a clause in an executive employment contract that provides the executive with a significant severance package in the case that the executive loses their job through firing, restructuring, or even scheduled retirement. This can be in the form of cash, equity, and other benefits, and is often accompanied by an accelerated vesting of stock options. According to Investopedia, a golden handshake is similar to, but more generous than a golden parachute because it not only provides monetary compensation and/or stock options at the termination of employment, but also includes the same severance packages executives would get at retirement.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. It was coined by the city editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Frederick Ellis. It later gained currency in New Zealand in the late 1990s over the controversial departures of various state sector executives.

&quot;Golden handshakes&quot; are typically offered only to high-ranking executives by major corporations and may entail a value measured in millions of dollars. Golden handshakes are given to offset the risk inherent in taking the new job, since high-ranking executives have a high likelihood of being fired and since a company requiring an outsider to come in at such a high level may be in a precarious financial position. Their use has caused some investors concern since they do not specify that the executive has to perform well. In some high-profile instances, executives cashed in their stock options, while under their stewardship their companies lost millions of dollars and thousands of workers were laid off.

== Perverse incentives ==
Golden handshakes may create perverse incentives for top executives to facilitate the sale of the company they are managing by artificially reducing its stock price.

It is fairly easy for a top executive to reduce the price of their company&#x27;s stock due to information asymmetry. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in off balance sheet transactions to make the company&#x27;s profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (e.g. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce share price. (This is again due to information asymmetries, since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to window dress their company&#x27;s earnings forecasts).

A reduced share price makes a company an easier takeover target. When the company gets bought out (or taken private) - at a dramatically lower price - the takeover artist gains a windfall from the former top executive&#x27;s actions to surreptitiously reduce share price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous shareholders to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a golden handshake for presiding over the firesale that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work. (This is nevertheless an excellent bargain for the takeover artist, who will tend to benefit from developing a reputation of being very generous to parting top executives). This is just one example of some of the principal-agent / perverse incentive issues involved with golden handshakes and golden parachutes. 

Similar issues occur when a publicly held asset or non-profit organization undergoes privatization. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just as in the example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis – this reduces the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser), and makes non-profits and governments more likely to sell. Ironically, it can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, thus again reinforcing the political will to sell off public assets.
Again, due to asymmetric information, policy makers and the general public see a government owned firm that was a financial &#x27;disaster&#x27; – miraculously turned around by the private sector (and typically resold) within a few years.

<text>Michael Roberts (6 December 1902 – 13 December 1948), originally named William Edward Roberts, was an English poet, writer, scientist, mathematician, critic and broadcaster, a polymath who made his living as a teacher.

==Life==

He was born in Bournemouth, named William Edward Roberts. He was the eldest child of Edward George Roberts and Henrietta Mary Sellers. He was educated at Bournemouth School. From 1920 to 1922 he studied at King&#x27;s College London, taking a BSc in Chemistry. From 1922 to 1925 he read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge; it was during this period of his life he acquired the name Michael (after Mikhail Lomonosov). In 1925 or 1926 he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain but was expelled within a year. According to Philip Spratt, who was one of only a handful of fellow communists attending Cambridge at this time, Roberts was suspected by the Marxist academic Maurice Dobb of being a fascist spy.

From 1925 to 1931 he taught at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle. Then he moved to London, teaching at Mercers&#x27; School from 1931 to 1934. He then returned to the RGS, where he worked until 1941, teaching English, mathematics, physics and chemistry. Having published his first poetry collection in 1930, he began to edit anthologies, of which &quot;New Country&quot; (1933) was celebrated for the group of poets (including W. H. Auden) that it featured. In 1934, he participated in a series of radio broadcasts, &quot;Whither Britain?&quot; along with Winston Churchill, George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Bevin.

The next year, he married Janet Adam Smith, critic, anthologist, and fellow mountaineer; they lived in Fern Avenue, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1939 they went to Penrith in Cumberland when the school was evacuated there. There they briefly shared a house with the poet Kathleen Raine.

Together, they had four children: Andrew Roberts, Professor of the History of Africa at the University of London, born 1937; Henrietta Dombey, Professor of Literacy in Primary Education at the University of Brighton, born 1939; Adam Roberts, Professor of International Relations at Oxford University, born 1940; and John Roberts, writer on energy issues and Middle East politics, born 1947.

The &quot;Faber Book of Modern Verse&quot; (1936), which he edited, is the piece of work for which Roberts is now best remembered. &quot;
&quot;The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English&quot; states that Roberts&#x27; &quot;The Faber Book of Modern Verse&quot; was &quot;directly instrumental in forming the tastes of succeeding generations of readers.&quot; He followed it with poetry and prose writing, and a study of T. E. Hulme. In 1941–45 he worked in London for the BBC European Service, mainly on broadcasting to German-occupied countries. From 1945 to 1948 he was Principal of the College of St Mark and St John in Chelsea, London. He died of leukaemia in 1948. Roberts&#x27; posthumously published book &quot;The Estate of Man&quot; (1951) was an early analysis of ecological issues.

Michael and Janet Roberts had built up a collection of books on mountaineering, which (along with the collection of the Oxford University Mountaineering Club) provided a basis for establishment in December 1992 of the Oxford Mountaineering Library. This is now based in the Social Science Library in the Manor Road Building, Oxford, OX1 3UQ.

Many of his papers are in the National Library of Scotland, at Edinburgh. They include literary correspondence and records of his BBC work in 1941–45.

<doc id="811148" wikidata="Q465778" url="?curid=811148" title="Golden parachute">
<text>A golden parachute is an agreement between a company and an employee (usually an upper executive) specifying that the employee will receive certain significant benefits if employment is terminated. These may include severance pay, cash bonuses, stock options, or other benefits. Most definitions specify the employment termination is as a result of a merger or takeover, also known as &quot;change-in-control benefits&quot;, but more recently the term has been used to describe perceived excessive CEO (and other executive) severance packages unrelated to change in ownership (also known as a golden handshake).

==History==
The first use of the term &quot;golden parachute&quot; is credited to a 1961 attempt by creditors to oust Howard Hughes from control of Trans World Airlines. The creditors provided Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. an employment contract that included a clause that would pay him money if he lost his job.

The use of golden parachutes expanded greatly in the early 1980s in response to the large increase in the number of takeovers and mergers. American executive pay practices were subject to increasing public scrutiny in the 1980s. During the 1980s hostile takeover wave, the practice of using golden parachutes in an executive&#x27;s compensation package began to spread rapidly. By 1981, some 15% of the 250 largest U.S. corporations had golden parachutes in place.

In Europe the highest &quot;change-in-control benefits&quot; have been for French executives, as of 2006 according to a study by the Hay Group human resource management firm. French executives receive roughly double their combined salary and bonus amounts in their golden parachute.

News reference volume of the term &quot;golden parachute&quot; spiked in late 2008 during the global economic recession, and 2008 US presidential debates. Despite the poor economy, in the two years before 2012 a study by the professional services firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal found a 32% increase in the value of &quot;change-in-control benefits&quot; provided to US executives. In late 2011, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported several CEO retirement packages in excess of $100 million, &quot;raising eyebrows even among those accustomed to oversized payouts&quot;.

In the 1980s, golden parachutes prompted shareholder suits challenging the parachutes&#x27; validity, SEC &quot;termination agreement disclosure rules&quot; in 1986, and provisions in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 aimed at limiting the size of future parachutes with a special tax on payouts that topped three times annual pay. In the 1990s in the United States, some government efforts were made to diminish &quot;change-in-control benefits&quot;. As of 1996, Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code denies a corporation a deduction for any excess &quot;parachute payment&quot; made to a departing employee, and Section 4999 imposes on the recipient a nondeductible 20% excise tax, in addition to regular income and Social Security taxes.

The 2010 United States Dodd-Frank Act includes in its provisions a mandate for shareholder votes on any future adoption of a golden parachute by publicly traded firms. In Switzerland, a referendum which &quot;would give shareholders the power to veto executive pay plans, including golden parachutes&quot; was put to a vote on March 3, 2013. Voters approved measures limiting CEO pay and outlawing golden parachutes.

===Studies and reports===
One study found golden parachutes associated with an increased likelihood of either receiving an acquisition offer or being acquired, a lower premium (in share price) in case of an acquisition, and higher (unconditional) expected acquisition premiums. It found firms adopting golden parachutes have lower market value compared to assets of the company and that their value continues to decline during and after adopting golden parachutes.

&quot;Gratuitous&quot; payments made to CEOs on agreeing to have their companies acquired (i.e. payments made to CEOs by the acquiring company not mandated under the CEO&#x27;s contract at the time the company is acquired) have been criticized. A &quot;prominent&quot; mergers and acquisitions lawyer told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;I have had a number of situations where we&#x27;ve gone to management looking to do a deal and been stopped at the door until a compensation arrangement was signed, sealed, and delivered.&quot; Another lawyer told the &quot;Times&quot;: &quot;Publicly, we have to call these things retention bonuses. Privately, sometimes it&#x27;s the only way we would have got the deal done. It&#x27;s a kickback.&quot;

A study investigating acquirer-paid sweeteners at 311 large-firm acquisitions completed between 1995 and 1997 found that CEOs of the acquired companies accept lower acquisition premiums when the acquirer promised them a high-ranking managerial post after the acquisition.

Golden parachutes are often viewed as excessive due to the substantial payouts given to senior management after an acquisition. This is further seen as excessive because other stakeholders during these acquisitions can be subject to layoffs. Golden parachutes can preserve a firms value for all stakeholders and are set in place to protect CEO’s during potential takeover situations.

On June 24, 2013, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that McKesson Corporation chairman and CEO John Hammergren&#x27;s pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for &quot;the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America.&quot; A study in 2012 by GMI Ratings, which tracks executive pay, found that 60% of CEOs at S&amp;P 500 companies have pensions, and their value averages $11.5 million.

On June 29, 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on research findings suggesting that &quot;despite years of public outcry against such deals, multimillion-dollar severance packages are still common&quot;, and they continue to become &quot;more complex and opaque&quot;.

==Arguments for and against==

===Support===
Proponents of golden parachutes argue that the parachutes provide benefits to stockholders:
* Make it easier to hire and retain executives, especially in industries more prone to mergers.
* Help an executive to remain objective about the company during the takeover process, and possible loss of position after takeover.
* Dissuade takeover attempts by increasing the cost of a takeover, often part of a poison pill strategy.
* It helps the CEO to implement long-term targets thereby increasing revenue of the organisation (Mapetuse 2018)

===Opposition===
While critics have pointed out that:
* Dismissal is a risk in any occupation, and executives are already well compensated.
* Executives already have a fiduciary responsibility to the company, and should not need additional incentives to stay objective.
* Golden parachute costs are a very small percentage of a takeover&#x27;s costs and do not affect the outcome.
* Benefits create perverse incentives.

<doc id="811163" wikidata="Q539444" url="?curid=811163" title="Mac Thornberry">
<text>William McClellan &quot;Mac&quot; Thornberry (born July 15, 1958) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for Texas&#x27;s 13th congressional district from 1995 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, Thornberry represented the most Republican district in the United States by partisan voting index. The district covers the Texas Panhandle and stretched between the Oklahoma and New Mexico borders.

In September 2019, Thornberry announced that he would not run for reelection in 2020, and former Physician to the President Ronny Jackson was elected to succeed him.

==Early life, education, and career==

In the 1880s, Thornberry&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Amos Thornberry, a Union Army veteran, moved to Clay County, just east of Wichita Falls.

Thornberry is a lifelong resident of Clarendon, 60 miles (97 km) east of Amarillo in the heart of the 13th. His family has operated a ranch in the area since 1881. He received his Bachelor of Arts in history from Texas Tech University in Lubbock. He then obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.

He served as a staffer to two other Texas Republican congressmen, Tom Loeffler and Larry Combest, and as deputy assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs under Ronald Reagan before joining his brothers on the family ranch. Thornberry has called President Reagan &quot;...a great man and a great president, ranking in the top tier of all of our chief executives.&quot; He also practiced law in Amarillo.

Thornberry is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
Committee on Armed Services (Ranking Member)

Republican Study Committee

From 2015 to 2019, Thornberry served as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the first Texan of either party to hold this position. The committee oversees the Pentagon, all military services, and all Department of Defense agencies, including agency budgets and policies.

Thornberry lost his 2009 bid to chair the full Armed Services Committee to Buck McKeon, R-Calif., who had more seniority. He served as vice chair of the full committee during McKeon&#x27;s time as chairman. After taking the committee gavel at the beginning of the 114th Congress, Thornberry spearheaded a major Department of Defense acquisition reform effort that received bipartisan and bicameral support from House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-AZ).

Thornberry previously served on the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

On September 30, 2019, it was announced that Thornberry would not seek reelection in 2020.

==Tenure and political positions==
According to the &quot;National Journal&quot; Congressional Almanac, &quot;In the House, Thornberry has compiled a solidly conservative voting record, though he has a pragmatic streak and is hardly the most ideological Republican in the Texas delegation. In keeping with his scholarly nature, his official website includes an essay explaining his philosophy and explaining his interest &#x27;in continuing to push government to work smarter and more efficiently.&#x27;&quot;

From January 1995 to July 2017, Thornberry missed 140 of 15,276 roll call votes, or 0.9%, fewer than the median of 2.2% among the lifetime records of representatives currently serving.

===Foreign policy===
Thornberry was critical of President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2010 arms control deal with Russia for precluding the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear nations. But he has been more pragmatic than other defense hawks. He served on a bipartisan commission in 2007 that drew up recommendations for winning the war in Iraq with both lethal and non-lethal approaches, such as diplomacy and foreign aid.

===Taxation===
On domestic issues, Thornberry pressed for repeal of the estate tax and for tax credits to encourage production of oil in marginal wells.

===Other===
In 2010 Thornberry sponsored a bill to expand access to state veterans&#x27; homes to parents whose children died while serving in the military. That bill became law. In January 2011 he introduced a bill to help states set up special health care courts staffed by judges with expertise in the subject. The judges would serve as an alternative to juries that Republicans say are inclined to award unnecessarily large damage amounts in malpractice cases.

===Term limits===
Thornberry consistently voted for term limits for U.S. Representatives, but did not intend to term-limit himself unless a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on all members of Congress had passed.

===Agriculture and farm bill===
Thornberry pressed the House to pass a farm bill every five years in order to give farmers and ranchers more stability. In 2013 he voted for the five-year Farm Bill, which included annual cuts of $2 billion from food stamps, which would have been the largest change to food policy since 1996. The House did not pass the bill.

===Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012===
In 2012 Thornberry introduced the Smith-Mundt Modernation Act of 2012 to amend the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act prohibiting the domestic dissemination of propaganda produced for foreign audiences.

===Energy and climate change===
In 2013 Thornberry introduced H.R. 2081, legislation to encourage production of all forms of domestic energy, including oil and gas, nuclear, and alternative energy and fuels.

Thornberry voted to open the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling. He voted to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and voted against tax credits for renewable electricity.

In July 2015, President Obama signed highway funding extension legislation into law. It included a provision based on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) excise tax bill, H.R. 905, that Thornberry introduced with Rep. John Larson (D-CT). The federal excise tax on LNG and diesel has been set at 24.3 cents per gallon. Because it takes 1.7 gallons of LNG to produce the same amount of energy as a gallon of diesel fuel, LNG is being taxed 70 percent higher than diesel. The new law &quot;levels the playing field&quot; by applying the excise tax to LNG and diesel based on the amount of energy each produces, which is how it is applied to compressed natural gas and gasoline.

=== Defense reform ===
&quot;In 2013, Thornberry led a long term effort to reform the Pentagon&#x27;s acquisition programs. In 2016, he set acquisition reform as a key feature of the annual defense spending bill, including steps such as more experimentation with technology, encouragement of competition and clarification of intellectual property rights of Pentagon contractors.&quot;

===Cybersecurity===
In 2011, House Speaker John Boehner selected Thornberry to lead an initiative on cybersecurity to combat the growing national security and economic threat. The task force was composed of representatives from nine committees with jurisdiction over cyber issues. The panel recommended reforming a range of current laws, including the 2002 Federal Information Security Management Act, which governs government security programs.

In a 2012 column for Federal News Radio, Thornberry wrote, &quot;If we can get an information sharing bill to the President, however, Congress should not consider their work done. We still have larger issues to grapple with, such as the role of the Department of Homeland Security and whether some industries will require a regulatory nudge to improve their network standards.&quot; That year, the House passed comprehensive cybersecurity legislation, but the Senate failed to act on any of it.

===Drugs===
In 2015, Thornberry introduced H.R. 1186, the Synthetic Abuse and Labeling Toxic Substances (SALTS) Act, which would make it easier for law enforcement officials to take action against synthetic drug manufacturers, distributors, and sellers by closing a loophole that makes it difficult to prosecute them if they label packages as &quot;not intended for human consumption.&quot;

===Interest group ratings===
* In 2012, the American Conservative Union Ratings of Congress gave Thornberry a 96% rating for the year. He has a lifetime score of 95%.
* The National Right to Life Committee consistently scored Thornberry at 100%.
* The American Family Association, Christian Coalition of America, and Family Research Council all consistently gave Thornberry a 100% rating on family and marriage issues.
* The National Rifle Association gave Thornberry a lifetime rating of 92% on 2nd Amendment and gun rights issues.
* Gun Owners of America gave Thornberry a score of 90% on 2nd Amendment and gun rights issues.
* The Disabled American Veterans and Vietnam Veterans of America both gave Thornberry a 100% score on veterans&#x27; issues.
* Both the Fleet Reserve Association and Non Commissioned Officers Association gave Thornberry a 100% score on military issues.

==Political campaigns==

Thornberry defeated Democratic Congressman Bill Sarpalius in the 1994 general election, a heavily Republican year nationwide. He polled 79,416 votes (55 percent) to Sarpalius&#x27;s 63,923 votes (44 percent). Two years earlier in a much higher-turnout election, Sarpalius received nearly double the votes that he did in 1994. The 13th has always been a somewhat conservative district, but on paper had been made somewhat less Republican in the 1990s redistricting. For this reason, Thornberry&#x27;s victory was regarded as an upset.

Thornberry would never face another contest nearly as close as his initial one, and was reelected 10 times with at least 67 percent of the vote. While voters in this region began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s, Democrats continued to hold most local offices well into the 1990s. Thornberry&#x27;s win began a wave of Republican victories in this region, and it is now reckoned as one of the most Republican districts in the nation. In 2013 the Cook Partisan Voting Index rated it the most Republican district in the country (R+32).

Thornberry is only the third Republican to represent the district for a full term since Reconstruction. The previous Republican representatives were Robert D. &quot;Bob&quot; Price of Pampa (1967–75) and Beau Boulter of Amarillo (1985–89).

In the 2006 and 2008 elections, Thornberry handily defeated former intelligence officer and professor Roger Waun.

In the 2012 Republican primary, Thornberry overwhelmed his lone opponent, Pamela Lee Barlow, 47,251 votes (78 percent) to 13,643 (22 percent). In the general election, Thornberry bested (91 percent) Libertarian John Robert Deek of Denton and Green Party candidate Keith F. Houston of Canyon (there was no Democratic candidate).

In the 2014 Republican primary, Thornberry easily won re-nomination, with 45,097 votes (68 percent) to challengers Pamela Barlow&#x27;s 12,438 (19 percent) and Elaine Hays&#x27;s 8,860 (13 percent).

===General election results===






























== Later career ==
=== Business ===
Thornberry joined the CAE USA board of directors, the National Defense Industrial Association Emerging Technologies Institute advisory board, and the Potomac Institute&#x27;s board of regents after retiring from government service. In October 2022, Thornberry was appointed to the Defense Innovation Board. As of October 2023, he serves on the Special Competitive Studies Project&#x27;s board of advisors. In March 2024, Thornberry was appointed to the board of directors at Booz Allen Hamilton.

<doc id="811169" wikidata="Q3715093" url="?curid=811169" title="Dragonfly (AC Comics)">
<text>Dragonfly is a fictional comic book superheroine. Created by Rik Levins, she debuted in &quot;Americomics&quot; #4 (October 1983) and starred in her own self-titled series.

==Publication history==
After a one-page advertising insert that appeared in &quot;Americomics&quot; #3, Dragonfly made her first appearance in issue #4. She was spun off into her own eponymous title that ran for eight issues (1985-1987). Though published by AC Comics, the series was both owned and funded by creator Rik Levins. According to AC president Bill Black, the &quot;Dragonfly&quot; contract stipulated that 70% of profits would go to Levins and 30% to AC Comics, but in practice the title consistently broke even. After Dragonfly became a member of the &quot;Femforce&quot;, she appeared semi-regularly in that magazine&#x27;s run.

==Fictional character biography==
Dragonfly is the secret identity of Nancy Arazello, one-time friend of Ken Burton, an engineer obsessed with the occult. In his researches, Ken finds a coded diary belonging to John Gallegher, a male Dragonfly who died in 1957. Using his computer skills, Ken decodes the diary and arranges to perform the mystic ritual that summons Zzara. Nancy interrupts this ceremony at a critical moment and is transformed into Dragonfly.

Nancy later learns that Zzara is an extradimensional insect-god (or demon, opinions vary). Zzara used an image from Nancy&#x27;s subconscious, &quot;her ideal of perfect feminine beauty&quot;, a statuesque platinum blonde, and used it as the basis for Dragonfly. He modified it, stamping his identifying marks, which included compound eyes and diaphanous wings. Nancy&#x27;s mind supplied more prosaic details, such as a zipper in the black body suit with a white dragonfly emblem on the chest, 4-inch heels, and sunglasses to hide the eyes. When Nancy does not inhabit the Dragonfly body, it is stored in an extradimensional crystal sphere that maintains the body&#x27;s original specifications.

==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to the mystical rays of Zzara, Dragonfly is given an idealized body that can fly (she can reach speeds of Mach 4), super-strength, and the ability to move objects with her mind.

==Reception==
For &quot;The Slings &amp; Arrows Comic Guide&quot;, &quot;Dragonfly&quot; had an &quot;oddball opening&quot;, but it &quot;quickly became a routine, if not badly done, superheroine feature&quot;.

<text>The HP-22S is an electronic calculator from the Hewlett-Packard company which is algebraic and scientific. This calculator is comparable to the HP-32S. A solver was included instead of programming. It had the same constraints as the 32S, lacking enough RAM for serious use. Functions available include TVM and unit conversions. Only single letter variable names are allowed. Marketed as a student calculator, the 22S uses infix notation rather than the reverse polish notation used on some higher-end HP calculators of the same era.

== Features ==

The HP-22S includes many of the typical features found in most scientific calculators:
* Trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
* Polar/rectangular coordinate conversion
* Probability functions and statistical calculators (mean and standard deviation, weighted mean, linear regression)
* Unit and base conversions

== Hardware ==

The 22S has the same physical form factor and 37-key keypad as other models in the Pioneer series. Introduced simultaneously with the HP-32S, it is based on the same hardware, with a single line character-based dot matrix display that can display both numerical and alphabetical characters. The CPU is an HP Saturn &quot;Sacajawea&quot; chip clocked at 640 kHz, making it slower than its higher-spec cousin, the HP-27S.

== Equation solving and equation library ==

HP&#x27;s advertising for the 22S emphasized the equation solver and library of built-in equations. This feature allows a multi-variable equation to be entered by the user, and the equation solved for a particular unknown variable given the value of other variables.

For convenience the 22S includes a set of common mathematical and scientific formulae, including:
* Quadratic roots
* Kinetic energy
* Ideal gas law
* Fluid pressure
* Radioactive decay
* Time value of money

<doc id="811194" wikidata="Q522760" url="?curid=811194" title="Miraj">
<text>Miraj (Pronunciation: ; ) is a city that is part of the Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad metropolitan region in Sangli district, Maharashtra. Founded in the early 10th century, Miraj was an important jagir of the Bijapur Sultanate.

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, stayed in Miraj for two months during his south India campaign. Because of its location, Miraj has been held as a strategic bastion. It was the capital of Miraj Senior and a vital junction on the central railway network. The Patwardhan family were the hereditary rulers of Miraj until independence.

Miraj is known for Hindustani classical music and medical services. It is an emerging medical hub in India. The city has an unbelievable doctor-to-patient ratio. The low cost of medical treatment, treatment facilities, and adjoining medical facilities attract patients to Miraj. The language is a key factor as most of the Kannada-speaking staff attract many patients from North Karnataka. Many medical tourists visit from the adjoining districts of North Karnataka and Goa, as well as all over India and from Arab countries. The annual Ganesh Visarjan procession is an attraction that lasts for an average of twenty hours.

==History==

=== Shilahara (1000 to 1216) ===
At the end of the 9th century, the Shilaharas of Kolhapur gained control of Miraj. In 1024, the city was ruled by Narasimha of the Shilahar dynasty. Jatiga II (), the fourth Shilahar ruler, appears in the records of his son, Narasimha (c. 1050–1075). Jatiga II was succeeded by his son Gonka, who has been described in inscriptions as the conqueror of Karahata (Karad), Miraj, and Konkan. The Shilaharas were able to retain control of Miraj despite nearby military action by Chavan-raja, a general of Western Chalukya King Jayasimha II.

===Yadavas and Bahmanis (1216 to 1347)===
In 1216, Miraj, along with other Shilahara territory, was conquered by the Yadavas of Devagiri. In 1318, the Bahmanis gained control. The historian Tazkirat-ul-Mulk reported that Hasan Gangu, the founder of the Bahmani dynasty, was in the employ of the Shaikh Muhammad Junaidi at Gangi near Miraj. Hasan found a treasure with which he raised an army, and marched on Miraj. He defeated and imprisoned Rani Durgavati, the subedar of Miraj, and captured the town&#x27;s fort. At the behest of Shaikh Muhammad, the name of the town was changed to &quot;Mubarakabad&quot; in 1347 (748 AH). In 1395, the Bahmanis conquered Miraj. Between 1391 and 1403, Miraj was affected by the Durga Devi famine. From 1423, Malik Imad Ul Mulk ruled Miraj. 1494 was the year of Bahadur Khan Gilani&#x27;s rebellion. For two months in 1660, Shivaji and Adilshah battled for control of Miraj.

===Fortress===
The builder of Miraj fort is unknown. It probably predates the Bahmani sultans, although they may have repaired it and increased its fortifications. They used the fort as a base for military expeditions against South Konkan and Goa. Firishta mentions the fort in an account of Gilani&#x27;s rebellion in 1494, which was quelled by Sultan Muhammad II (1452–1515). Muhammad II took the fort from its governor, Buna Naik, who acquiesced to the new ruler. Gilani&#x27;s troops were offered the option of joining Muhammad&#x27;s army and being treated with leniency or leaving. About 2000 soldiers left the fort to join Gilani&#x27;s rebel forces. 

The fortress&#x27;s main entrance was a massive gate towering at , but it has been destroyed.

===Fall of the Bahmani Empire===
The power of the Bahmani rulers waned under the influence of powerful provincial governors. In 1490, the rule of Miraj passed to the Sultanate of Bijapur. During the later years of his reign, Ibrahim Adil Shah I (1534–1558) kept his son, Ali Adil Shah I (1558–1580), under house arrest in Miraj. On Ibrahim&#x27;s death in 1580, Miraj became an assembly point for Ali&#x27;s troops in his assuming the throne. Subsequently, the troops of Miraj fought with Ismail against Ibrahim Adil Shah II.

===Rise of the Maratha Empire===
On 28 November 1659, within 18 days of Bijapur General Afzal Khan&#x27;s death at Pratapgad, the western Adil Sahi district was surrendered to Annaji Datto (Shivaji&#x27;s finance minister). Unlike other towns, the Miraj fort resisted. Shivaji, who was encamped at Kolhapur, sent Netaji Palkar to besiege Miraj. In January 1660, Shivaji arrived to personally command the three-month-long ongoing siege. However, news of attacks by Siddi Johar and Fazal Khan caused him to return to Panhala. The siege of Miraj was abandoned and negotiations began. Under the rule of Sambhaji, the Maratha Empire generals Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav chose Miraj as a safe place for their families while they conducted guerrilla actions against the invading forces of Aurangzeb of the Mughal Empire.

===Mughal Empire===
In 1687, Bijapur was conquered by the Mughals. Santaji Ghorpade became Deshmukh of Miraj in 1680 and Aurangzeb captured the town six years later. In 1730, Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu of Satara ordered Pant Pratinidhi to attack the town. Miraj remained under Mughal rule until 3 October 1739, when it was captured by Shahu after a military campaign of two years, reflecting the fall of the last defences of the Mughals. In 1761, Harbhat Patwardhan&#x27;s son, Gopalrao, took the Miraj jagir from Peshwa Madhavrao.

===British Raj===
The Patwardhan dynasty ruled Miraj as the capital of a principality, overseen by British rule. Miraj was part of the southern division of the Bombay Presidency which in turn was part of the southern Maratha jagirs, and later the Deccan States Agency. In 1820, the state of Miraj was divided into Miraj Senior and Miraj Junior. The territory of both regions was distributed among other native states and British districts. The area of Miraj Senior was . In 1901, its population was 81,467. Its revenue was £23,000 and the tax paid to the British was £800. The population of the town of Miraj in 1901 was 18,425. It lay on a junction of the Southern Mahratta Railway. 

===Independence===
On 8 March 1948, Miraj Senior acceded to the Dominion of India, and the city became part of the Republic of India. Since 1960, it has been part of the state of Maharashtra.

== Climate ==

== Demographics ==
Marathi is the official language, while Kannada is also a widely spoken language of the city. A form of Hindustani, Hyderabadi Deccani is also spoken.

==Hindustani classical music==
Miraj is a popular place for artists to perform during urus. The administrative office of the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya is at Miraj. The city is known for its players and manufacturers of sitars.

===Musicians===
* Vishnu Digambar Paluskar
* Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande
* Hirabai Badodekar
* Vinayakrao Patwardhan
* Bal Gandharva made his debut performance at the city&#x27;s Hans Prabha Theatre. In the same location, the Balgandharva Natyagruha was named for him.
* Abdul Karim Khan, a performer of Kirana gharana, lies interred within the Hadrat Khwaja Shamna Mira RH and Hadrat Mira Saheb RH Dargah. An annual music festival at the dargah takes place in his memory.
* Ram Kadam, a Marathi film composer and musician

==String instruments==
Miraj supplies Indian string instruments such as the sitar, sarod, and tanpura. These are made of wood and specially treated gourds. The art of instrument making was developed by Faridsaheb Shikalgar in the 18th century, and his descendants, who now use &#x27;Sitarmaker&#x27; as their surname, follow this tradition. The area of Miraj is known for creating sitars. The traditional craft of making these instruments is passed down from generation to generation.

== Famous places ==
Miraj is also known for Khwaja Shamna Mira, a dargah over the tomb of Khwaja Muhammad Mira Hussaini Chishti, a Sufi originally from Kashgar who migrated to Miraj. The story behind him is that at the time of his arrival in Miraj, the city was ruled by a black magician Gangna Dhobi who made human sacrifices. It is said that due to Mira&#x27;s spiritual power he convinced Dhobi to become a Muslim. Another story tells that Mira was walking barefoot, and a shoemaker decided to make shoes for him with skin torn from his own thigh. As a reward, he asked for the right to cover the first chadar of Mira during his urus. This has continued since, and during his urus a shoemaker first puts a chadar on the tomb.

== Transportation ==

=== Railway ===
Miraj Junction railway station is an important junction on the Central Railway. It was the only junction to have all three rail gauges: broad gauge, narrow gauge, and metre gauge. The last narrow gauge train departed on 1 November 2008. Miraj now has only broad gauge railway tracks. Miraj is connected by railway to Pune in the north, Kurduvadi via Pandharpur in the northeast, and Belgaum and Goa in the south. In February 2011, passenger trains from Kolhapur to Solapur began running on the converted Miraj-Pandharpur-Kurduvadi broad gauge track.

Trains of the South Western Railway, like the Rani Chennamma Express bound for Bengaluru, originate from Miraj Junction station.

=== Road ===
Miraj lies off the Mumbai-Pune-Bengaluru highway, NH 48. Sangli and Miraj form a triangle with two exits of NH 48, each about 50 km away. Though the time taken to travel from Miraj varies depending on speed and other factors, Mumbai is about 7 hours away, and Bengaluru about 11 hours away by car.

<text>White bread typically refers to breads made from wheat flour from which the bran and the germ layers have been removed from the whole wheatberry as part of the flour grinding or milling process, producing a light-colored flour.

== Nutrition ==

White bread contains half of the magnesium found in whole-wheat bread, and it is generally considered to be less nutritionally dense.

The milling process can give white flour a longer shelf life by removing the natural oils from the whole grain. Removing the oil allows products made with the flour, like white bread, to be stored for longer periods of time avoiding potential rancidity.

==History==

Bread made with grass grains goes back to the pre-agriculture Natufi proto-civilization 12,000 years ago. But only wheat can feasibly be sifted to produce pure white starch, a technique that goes back to at least ancient Egypt. Because wheat was the most expensive grain to grow, and the process to sift it labor-intensive, white flour was generally limited to special occasions and the wealthy, until the mid-19th century. Then industrial processes eliminated the labor cost, allowing prices to fall until it was accessible to the middle class.

In the US, corn meal was the standard grain for bread until closing in on the 20th century, while in Europe it was other grains.

But once accessible, white bread became very popular in industrialized countries for a number of reasons:

* It was easier to see as pure and clean, at a time when some foods could be poorly made and adulterated. 
* The lack of both coarseness and complex flavor profile made it a popular medium for the delivery of flavorful condiments. 
* It is more easily chewed and digested. This allows it to be a source of more calories. It also does make some micronutrients more digestible, some studies finding that the added nutrition in whole grains tends to pass through the body unabsorbed. For some body types and diets, white flour may have been a nutritional benefit.
* Once it could be easily produced, it went from the most expensive to among the cheapest kinds of flour.
* It can last longer. The wheat oil in whole grain breads can go rancid over time, spoiling its flavor.

However, there was a backlash from the popularity of white flour, giving rise to whole grain alternatives popular to this day, such as graham crackers and corn flakes, which (in their original whole grain form) have more fiber and micronutrients. Eventually, the transformation of white bread from an elite to a common foodstuff became symbolic of the success of industrialization and capitalism in general, especially paired with the advent of machine sliced bread in the 1920s.

In the United States, consumers sometimes refer to white bread as &quot;sandwich bread&quot; or &quot;sandwich loaf&quot;. It is often perceived as an unhealthy, bland, and unsophisticated menu item.

Japanese milk bread, a type of soft white bread, is popular in Asia, particularly in Japan, and has artisan status there. Bread was not a traditional food in Japan, but it came into culinary use there after the American response to post-World War II Japanese rice shortages included relief shipments of wheat. The style of bread became popular outside Asia in the 2020s.

==White bread fortification==
While a bran- and wheatgerm-discarding milling process can help improve white flour&#x27;s shelf life, it does remove nutrients like some dietary fiber, iron, B vitamins, micronutrients and essential fatty acids. The US government has mandated since 1941 fortification of white flour-based foods with some of the nutrients lost in milling, like thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and iron. This mandate came about in response to the vast nutrient deficiencies seen in US military recruits at the start of World War II. This fortification led to nearly universal eradication of deficiency diseases in the US, such as pellagra and beriberi (deficiencies of niacin and thiamine, respectively) and white bread continues to contain these added vitamins to this day.

Folic acid is another nutrient that some governments have mandated is added to enriched grains like white bread. In the US and Canada, these grains have been fortified with mandatory levels of folic acid since 1998 because of its important role in preventing birth defects. Since fortification began, the rate of neural tube defects has decreased by approximately one-third in the US. Folic acid supplementation was mandated in the UK in September 2021, joining more than 80 countries in the world with this public health measure.

<text>The TI-30 is a scientific calculator manufactured by Texas Instruments, the first model of which was introduced in 1976. While the original TI-30 was discontinued in 1983 after several design revisions, TI maintains the TI-30 designation as a branding for its low and mid-range scientific calculators.

==Price==
The original TI-30 was notable for its very low cost for the time, around US$25. This was much less than the retail prices of other scientific calculators of the era; for example, Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s cheapest scientific calculator at the time was still well over $100. The Casio FX-20, another popular scientific calculator, sold for roughly double the price of the TI-30. The TI-30 sold for less than the cost of a professional-grade slide rule. The TI-30 sold an estimated 15 million units during its lifespan from 1976–1983.

==Description==

The original TI-30, a cost-reduced but functionally equivalent version of TI&#x27;s SR-40, utilizing an LED display, and was powered by a 9-volt battery, and contained nearly all of its functionality in one chip, where previous calculators used many discrete components. The TI-30 could perform nearly all the logarithmic and trigonometric functions of an HP-21, its primary competition at the time. Although the Texas Instruments SR-50 pioneered algebraic notation with operation precedence in 1974, the TI-30 made those features available at a more affordable price.

Early production TI-30 units (c. 1976) contained a logic error in their calculation of inverse tangents. On these early models, pressing &quot;0 INV TAN&quot; (tan−1(0) on today&#x27;s models (TI-30X Plus MathPrint)) would cause the calculator to go into an infinite loop until it is powered off with the OFF button. The &quot;0&quot; had to be pressed on the keyboard; the calculator produced a correct answer if the &quot;0&quot; was the result of a previous calculation.

The TI-30 was at one point the most popular scientific calculator for junior high and high school use in the United States. For $24.95, the purchaser received both the calculator and a 224-page book, &quot;&quot;, which covered basics in algebra, business and finance, trigonometry, probability and statistics, physics and chemistry, and had ideas for games and puzzles that could be played with the calculator.

In 1980, Texas Instruments converted the TI-30 to use a liquid crystal display, releasing the TI-30 LCD in Europe and the TI-30 II a year later in the U.S. The calculator itself remained functionally similar over several redesigns in the following few years, with solar power coming to the line in 1982 in a joint venture with Toshiba. The &quot;X&quot; in all current TI-30 models refers to the addition of a 10+2 display (that is, a 10 digit mantissa plus a 2-digit exponent) in 1993; with the addition of a 2-line display and a D-pad in the XIIS/XIIB in 1999, the TI-30 line split in 2, with the TI-30Xa becoming TI&#x27;s overall entry-level scientific, and the enhanced XII designs offering more input flexibility to the user. The MultiView models, introduced in 2006 and 2007, replace the 2-line display with a dot matrix display similar to a graphing calculator, and move many of the functions traditionally placed on or next to individual calculator keys off onto menus very similar to those used on the popular TI-83 calculator line.

At one time or another, most models in the line since the introduction of the LCD models have been available in both solar powered and battery versions; the Xa retains solar power only on models sold in a few markets in Europe, while the XIIS and XS MultiView models run off both solar and battery power depending on available ambient light. The earliest model, however, uses a 9 volt battery, which is expected to last for approximately 20 hours of use, according to the Owner&#x27;s Manual. However, two rechargeable kits were offered, the RK-1 and the RK-2, which each contained a battery allowing for two hours and four hours of continuous use, respectively, before needing to be recharged.

* TI-30 (1976): first version; LED display
* TI-30 LCD (1978): the first LCD version. European market only. In 1986, TI had a recall (at least in Germany) where they offered replacement due to (possible) defects. TI-30 replacement free of charge, or TI-31 Solar with 10,- DM payment. Other models replaced were the TI-55II, TI-35 and TI-57LCD.
* TI-30 II (1981): slimline format with the TI-30 key layout
* TI-30 III (1984)
* TI-30 SLR (1982): with Toshiba calculating chip. It had 9 digits of calculating precision. (US units had 11 digits at that time.)
* TI-30 SLR+ (1987): solar
* TI-30 Stat (1988): added basic statistical functions
* TI-30 Galaxy: part of a line of landscape format calculators from the mid-1980s
* TI-30X (1993): the X signifies an expanded 10 digit display (from the original 8). Switching to a new circuit board design introduced a &quot;logarithm bug&quot;.
* TI-30Xa (1994): added the constant key to the TI-30X
* TI-30Xa (rev 1996): introduced a more modern, smoothed design. Currently the bottom of the TI-30 line, the Xa has a standard one-line, 10+2 digit display. The solar-powered eco RS model is available only in Europe.
* TI-30Xa Solar School Edition (2004): a modified version of the TI-30Xa, without the fraction buttons. This calculator is approved for Virginia State Testing.
* TI-30X IIS and TI-30X IIB (1998): added a two-line, scrollable display and a D-pad for navigating previous results. Solar/battery and battery powered respectively.
* TI-30XS and TI-30XB MultiView (2005): first non-graphing TI calculators with a dot-matrix display; able to display expressions in textbook-style notation. Uses a command syntax similar to TI-BASIC, but with no programming capability.
* TI-30X Pro MultiView and TI-36X Pro (2011): In addition to the features TI-30XS and TI-30XB MultiView, it features a solver, availability to calculate matrices, vectors, complex numbers and convert different units. The TI-36X Pro is the American and international version of the European model, the TI-30X Pro MultiView. The TI-30X Pro MultiView was released in 2010 and then promptly recalled because of programming errors. It was re-released in 2011.
* TI-30XA (2013): retained the size and shape of the 1996 model, having buttons rounded on the bottom, and the color of the &quot;2nd&quot; button changed from yellow to green. With introduction of a new circuit board in 2015 the logarithm bug was fixed, also the calculator switched to using just one 1.5V battery instead of two.
* TI-30X Plus MultiView (2015): a TI-30X Pro MultiView without certain advanced features. Only released in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland to meet the requirements of certain high schools that ban the removed features.
* TI-30X Pro MathPrint™ and TI-30X Plus MathPrint™ (2018): successors of TI-30X Pro MultiView/TI-36X Pro and TI-30X Plus MultiView. Both have a modern design, a higher resolution display and some other improvements.
* Ti-30X IIS (rev 2024): introduced a new color pallet for the numerical keys so that they matched the operational keys.

<text>Education in the Soviet Union was guaranteed as a constitutional right to all people provided through state schools and universities. The education system that emerged after the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 became internationally renowned for its successes in eradicating illiteracy and cultivating a highly educated population. Its advantages were total access for all citizens and post-education employment. The Soviet Union recognized that the foundation of their system depended upon an educated population and development in the broad fields of engineering, the natural sciences, the life sciences and social sciences, along with basic education.

==History==

In Imperial Russia, according to the 1897 Population Census, literate people made up 28.4 percent of the population. A mere 13% of women were literate.

In the first year after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the schools were left very much to their own devices due to the ongoing civil war of 1917–1923. The People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education directed its attention solely towards introducing political propaganda into the schools and forbidding religious teaching. In the autumn of 1918 the &quot;Uniform Labour School Regulations&quot; were issued for the RSFSR.
From October 1, 1918, all types of schools came under Commissariat for Education and were designated by the name &quot;Uniform Labour School&quot;. They were divided into two levels: the first for children from 8 to 13, and the second for children from 14 to 17. During the 8th Party Congress in March 1919, the creation of the new socialist system of education was said to be the major aim of the Soviet government. After that, Soviet school policy underwent numerous radical changes.

The period of the First World War (1914–1918), of the Russian Civil War (1917–1923) and of war communism (1918–1921) led to sharp drops in the number of schools and of enrolled students. Whereas in 1914, 91% of the children were receiving instruction in schools, in 1918 figure dropped to 62%, in 1919 to 49% and in 1920 to 24.9%. As a result, illiteracy grew rapidly.

In accordance with the Sovnarkom decree of 26 December 1919, signed by its chairman Vladimir Lenin, the new policy of likbez (), was introduced. A new system of universal compulsory education was established for children. Moreover, millions of illiterate adult people all over the country, including residents of small towns and villages, were enrolled in special literacy schools. Komsomol members and Young Pioneer detachments played an important role in the education of illiterate people in villages. In the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, the women&#x27;s literacy campaign was largely carried out by members of the Ali Bayramov Club, a women&#x27;s organization founded by Azeri Bolshevik women in Baku in 1920. The most active phase of &quot;likbez&quot; lasted until 1939. In 1926, the literacy rate was 56.6 percent of the population. By 1937, according to census data, the literacy rate was 86% for men and 65% for women, with a total literacy rate of 75%.
An important aspect of the early campaign for literacy and education was the policy of &quot;indigenisation&quot; (korenizatsiya). This policy, which lasted essentially from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s, promoted the development and use of non-Russian local and regional languages in the government, the media, and education. Intended to counter the historical practices of Russification, it had as another practical goal assuring native-language education as the quickest way to increase educational levels of future generations. A huge network of so-called &quot;national schools&quot; was established by the 1930s, and enrollments continued to grow throughout the Soviet era. Language policy changed over time, perhaps marked first of all in the government&#x27;s mandating in 1938 the teaching of Russian as a required &quot;subject&quot; of study in every non-Russian school, and then especially beginning in the latter 1950s in a growing conversion of non-Russian schools to use Russian as the main medium of instruction. However, an important legacy of the native-language and bilingual education policies over the years was the nurturing of widespread literacy in dozens of languages of indigenous nationalities of the USSR, accompanied by widespread and growing bilingualism where Russian was said to be the &quot;language of internationality communication&quot;

In 1923 a new school statute and curricula were adopted. Schools were divided into three separate types, designated by the number of years of instruction: &quot;four-year&quot;, &quot;seven-year&quot; and &quot;nine-year&quot; schools. Seven- and nine-year (secondary) schools were scarce, compared to the &quot;four-year&quot; (primary) schools, making it difficult for the pupils to complete their secondary education. Those who finished seven-year schools had the right to enter Technicums. Only nine-year schooling led directly to university-level education.

The curriculum was changed radically. Independent subjects, such as reading, writing, arithmetic, the mother tongue, foreign languages, history, geography, literature or science were abolished. Instead school programmes were subdivided into &quot;complex themes&quot;, such as &quot;the life and labour of the family in village and town&quot; for the first year or &quot;scientific organisation of labour&quot; for the 7th year of education. This system proved a complete failure, however, and in 1928 a new programme completely abandoned the complex themes and resumed instruction in individual subjects.

All students were required to take the same standardised classes. This continued until the 1970s, when older students began being given time to take elective courses of their own choice in addition to the standard courses.

From 1918 all Soviet schools were co-educational. In 1943, urban schools were separated into boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools. In 1954 the mixed-sex education system was restored.

Research and education, in all subjects but especially in the social sciences, was dominated by Marxist-Leninist ideology and supervised by the CPSU. Such domination led to abolition of whole academic disciplines such as genetics. Some scholars were purged as they were proclaimed bourgeois during that period. Most of the abolished branches of learning were rehabilitated later in Soviet history, in the 1960s–1990s (e.g., genetics in October 1964), although many purged scholars were rehabilitated only in post-Soviet times. In addition, many textbooks - such as history ones - were full of ideology and propaganda, and contained factually inaccurate information (see Soviet historiography). The educational system&#x27;s ideological pressure continued, but in the 1980s, the government&#x27;s more open policies influenced changes that made the system more flexible
. Shortly before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, schools no longer had to teach subjects from the Marxist-Leninist perspective at all.

Another aspect of the inflexibility was the high rate at which pupils were held back and required to repeat a year of schooling. In the early 1950s, typically 8–10% of pupils in elementary grades were held back a year. This was partly attributable to the pedagogical style of teachers, and partly to the fact that many of these children had disabilities that impeded their performance. In the latter 1950s, however, the Ministry of Education began to promote the formation of a wide variety of special schools (or &quot;auxiliary schools&quot;) for children with physical or mental handicaps. Once those children were taken out of the mainstream (general) schools, and once teachers began to be held accountable for the repeat-rates of their pupils, the rates fell sharply. By the mid-1960s the repeat-rates in the general primary schools declined to about 2%, and by the late 1970s to less than 1%.

The number of schoolchildren enrolled in special schools grew fivefold between 1960 and 1980. However, the availability of such special schools varied greatly from one republic to another. On a &quot;per capita&quot; basis, such special schools were most available in the Baltic republics, and least in the Central Asian ones. This difference probably had more to do with the availability of resources than with the relative need for the services by children in the two regions.

In the 1970s and 1980s, approximately 99.7% of Soviet people were literate.

==Classification and terms==
The Soviet educational system was organized into three levels. The names of these levels were and are still used to rate the education standards of persons or particular schools, despite differences in the exact terminology used by each profession or school. Military, &quot;militsiya&quot;, KGB and Party schools were also graded according to these levels. This distinguishes the Soviet system from the rest of the world, where educational levels of schools may differ, despite their similar names.

Elementary schools were called the &quot;beginning&quot; level (, &quot;nachalnoye&quot;), 4 and later 3 classes. Secondary schools were 7 and later 8 classes (required completing elementary school) and called &quot;incomplete secondary education&quot; (, &quot;nepolnoye sredneye obrazavaniye&quot;). This level was compulsory for all children (since 1958–1963) and optional for under-educated adults (who could study in so-called &quot;evening schools&quot;). Since 1981, the &quot;complete secondary education&quot; level (10 or, in some republics, 11 years) was compulsory.

10 classes (11 classes in the Baltic republics) of an ordinary school was called &quot;secondary education&quot; (—literally, &quot;middle education&quot;).

PTUs, tekhnikums, and some military facilities formed a system of so-called “secondary specialized education” (, &quot;sredneye spetsialnoye&quot;). PTU&#x27;s were vocational schools and trained students in a wide variety of skills ranging from mechanic to hairdresser. Completion of a PTU after primary school did not provide a full secondary diploma or a route to such a diploma. However, entry to a tekhnikum or other specialized secondary school could be started after either 8 or 10 classes of combined education in elementary and secondary school. Graduation from this level was required for the positions of qualified workers, technicians and lower bureaucrats (see also vocational education, professions, training).

“Higher” (, &quot;vyssheye&quot;) educational institutions included degree-level facilities: universities, “institutes” and military academies. &quot;Institute&quot; in the sense of a school refers to a specialized &quot;microuniversity&quot; (mostly technical), usually subordinate to the ministry associated with their field of study. The largest network &quot;institutes&quot; were medical, pedagogic (for the training of schoolteachers), construction and various transport (automotive and road, railroad, civil aviation) institutes. Some of those institutes were present in every oblast capital while others were unique and situated in big cities (like the Literature Institute and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology ). Colloquially these universities and institutes were all referred to by the acronym &quot;VUZ&quot; (&quot;ВУЗ – высшее учебное заведение&quot;, &quot;higher educational institution&quot;).

Students who wanted admission to a VUZ had to have graduated from either a general secondary school (10 or 11 years) or a specialized secondary school or a tekhnikum. Those who completed only vocational school (PTU) or &quot;incomplete secondary school&quot; were not certified as having completed secondary education (they lacked an &quot;аттестат зрелости&quot; – maturity certificate – or equivalent diploma from a specialized secondary school) and were thus not eligible to attend a VUZ.

Numerous military and &quot;militsiya&quot; (police) schools (, &quot;vyshee uchilische/shkola&quot;) were on the same higher level. Note that Soviet military and &quot;militsiya&quot; facilities named &quot;Academy&quot; (, &quot;Akademiya&quot;) were not a degree-level school (like Western military academies such as West Point), but a post-graduate school for experienced officers. Such schools were compulsory for officers applying for the rank of colonel. (see Soviet military academies)

KGB&#x27;s higher education institutions were called either &quot;schools&quot; (like &quot;Higher School of KGB&quot;) or &quot;institutes&quot; (like &quot;Red Banner Institute of KGB&quot; - training specifically intelligence officers).

CPSU&#x27;s higher education institutions were called &quot;Higher Party Schools&quot; (, &quot;vysshaya partiynaya shkola&quot;).

The spirit and structure of Soviet education is mostly inherited by many post-Soviet countries despite formal changes and social transitions.

<text>The Mexican weeping bamboo, Otatea acuminata, is a clumping bamboo native to central and southern Mexico and Central America.

The plant produces thick stands of culms with long narrow leaves. The weight of the leaves cause the long thin culms to bend, or weep. The clump&#x27;s vegetation can reach or more in height and width in its native habitat.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; and its cultivars are cultivated as an ornamental plant, often planted in subtropical and temperate climate gardens in full or partial sun. The plant is drought tolerant when established, but benefits from periodic watering and feeding. Mexican Weeping Bamboo is easily grown in pots, reaching around tall. When planted in the ground it can reach or more with regular water.

Mexican Weeping Bamboo is easy to propagate by dividing the root ball with a sharp spade. A particularly delicate look can be achieved by thinning the culms so that they are spaced or more apart. This allows dappled light to pass through the Mexican Weeping Bamboo, and the plant will sway gracefully in a gentle breeze.

&quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; is a fast-growing clumping bamboo which can spread in each direction yearly. It is well suited to the climate and soil in Southern California, and can be successfully grown and propagated with minimal effort. Unlike many other bamboo species, the leaves do not brown at the tips even under suboptimal growing conditions.

===Subspecies and cultivars===
There are several subspecies and cultivars, including:
* &quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; subsp. &quot;acuminata&quot;
* &quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; subsp. &quot;aztecorum&quot; — the most commonly cultivated ornamental plant.
* &quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; &#x27;Dwarf&#x27;
* &quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; &#x27;Mayan Silver&#x27;
* &quot;Otatea acuminata&quot; &#x27;Michoacan&#x27;

<text>City of Glass is a book by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, published by Douglas and McIntyre in 2000, featuring short essays and photographs of his home town of Vancouver, British Columbia. Each essay deals with a different aspect of the city, such as the glass condominium towers which dominate the Vancouver skyline and give the book its title. It also includes the short story &quot;My Hotel Year&quot;, which first appeared in Coupland&#x27;s &quot;Life After God&quot; (1994), and the essay on another Vancouver landmark, Lions&#x27; Gate Bridge, which was published in &quot;Polaroids from the Dead&quot; (1996). An updated version of the text was released in 2009.

Canadian-born artist Una Knox produced the majority of photographic images for this book.

<doc id="811229" wikidata="Q5249952" url="?curid=811229" title="Dee Stadium">
<text>Dee Stadium, also called The Dee, is an ice hockey arena in Houghton, Michigan, that replaced, and is located on the same site as, the Amphidrome. It is regarded as the birthplace of professional hockey, and is the seventh oldest indoor ice rink in the world.

==Amphidrome==
The Houghton Warehouse Company, operated by James R. Dee, built and owned the Amphidrome. Construction of the Amphidrome finished in December 1902.

The first hockey game was played on December 29, 1902, in which the Portage Lakes Hockey Club defeated the University of Toronto, 13–2. The game was attended by over 5,000 spectators. For the 1903–04 season, the Portage Lakes became the first hockey team whose players were all paid. James Dee and John &quot;Doc&quot; Gibson formed the International Hockey League later that year, in which the Portage Lakes competed. These events marked the beginning of professional hockey.

In 1907, an addition was constructed on the western end of the Amphidrome. Styled like a castle, it was used as a community ballroom and armory.

===Fire===
The Amphidrome burned down on January 9, 1927. The fire was discovered at 3:45 a.m. in the upper floors of the 1907 addition. The fire destroyed a nearby warehouse and the equipment of the Portage Lakes, the Michigan College of Mines hockey team, and the Houghton and Hancock high school sextets. The fire cancelled the regional high school hockey season and forced other area teams to use the Calumet Colosseum in Calumet, Michigan.

==Dee Stadium==
===History===
After the loss of the Amphidrome, the debris was cleared and a temporary outdoor rink was formed. Before the next season, in 1928, a replacement stadium was constructed called the New Amphidrome. James Dee assisted in financing the reconstruction.

The New Amphidrome was renamed the James R. &quot;Dee&quot; Ice Stadium in 1943 when the Michigan College of Mining and Technology (now Michigan Technological University) purchased it for their hockey team. Michigan Tech played their last hockey game in Dee Stadium on December 4, 1971, after which they moved to the Student Ice Arena.

In 1974, the City of Houghton signed a 99-year lease for the Dee Stadium from Michigan Tech. In May 1983, the City of Houghton eliminated Dee Stadium from their annual budget due to financial reasons and the recent vandalism at Dee Stadium. The Copper Country Junior Hockey Association (CCJHA) was blamed for the vandalism. The City of Houghton told &quot;The Daily Mining Gazette&quot; that the young hockey players were the reason the Dee is falling apart and that the city is not at fault for the condition of the Dee.

With the City threatening to close Dee stadium, 468 adults and 423 students signed a petition to keep the Dee open for use. The Houghton High School Hockey coach at the time Don Miller said, &quot;By having to move to either Houghton County Arena or the Student Ice Arena, a severe scheduling problem would arise...especially the Houghton High School Hockey Team.&quot; All kinds of community groups got involved with the Dee petition. The Houghton-Portage Teachers Education Association expressed their interest in the situation by stating, &quot;the teachers feel strongly about Dee Stadium and the purpose that it serves. For the next five years, there were fundraising efforts to save Dee Stadium from being closed&quot;. These fundraisers also provided Dee Stadium with the proper improvements that it needed. At each of these annual fund raising dinners, there were 200 tickets sold at $100 at ticket, which gained an $8,000 profit per year. The goal with this money was to put new siding on all four sides of the building and to put in new insulation to make the ballroom available for year-round use.

In 1988, the City of Houghton purchased the Dee Stadium.

===Current use===
Dee Stadium is the current home of the Houghton High School Hockey team and Portage Lake Pioneers Senior Hockey team. It is a venue for Michigan Tech&#x27;s Winter Carnival and the annual Parade of Nations festival.

===Facilities===
Upstairs at the Dee Stadium was the Level II skatepark. The park was originally built in 2000 and rebuilt in 2005. Besides having various ramps for skateboarding and biking they also had a stage for concerts. The park was closed due to waning interest.

The Dee Stadium houses a museum that showcases the history of the site and the history of ice hockey in the area.

<doc id="811240" wikidata="Q152095" url="?curid=811240" title="Bathtub">
<text>A bathtub, also known simply as a bath or tub, is a container for holding water in which a person or another animal may bathe. Most modern bathtubs are made of thermoformed acrylic, porcelain-enameled steel or cast iron, or fiberglass-reinforced polyester. A bathtub is placed in a bathroom, either as a stand-alone fixture or in conjunction with a shower.

Modern bathtubs have overflow and waste drains and may have taps mounted on them. They are usually built-in, but may be free-standing or sometimes sunken. Until acrylic thermoforming technology permitted other shapes, virtually all bathtubs used to be roughly rectangular. Bathtubs are commonly white in color, although many other colors can be found. 

Two main styles are common:
* Western style bathtubs in which the bather lies down. These baths are typically shallow and long.
* Eastern style bathtubs in which the bather sits up. These are known as &quot;furo&quot; in Japan and are typically short and deep.

== History of bathtubs and bathing ==
Documented early plumbing systems for bathing go back as far as around 3300 BC with the discovery of copper water pipes beneath a palace in ancient Europe. Evidence of the earliest surviving personal sized bath tub was found on the Isle of Crete where a long pedestal tub was found built from hardened pottery.

The clawfoot tub, which reached the apex of its popularity in the late 19th century, had its origins in the mid 18th century, when the ball and claw design originated in the Netherlands, possibly artistically inspired by the Chinese motif of a dragon holding a precious stone. The design spread to England, where it found much popularity among the aristocracy, just as bathing was becoming increasingly fashionable. Early bathtubs in England tended to be made of cast iron, or even tin and copper with a face of paint applied that tended to peel with time.

The Scottish-born inventor David Buick invented a process for bonding porcelain enamel to cast iron in the 1880s while working for the Alexander Manufacturing Company in Detroit. The company, as well as others including Kohler Company and J. L. Mott Iron Works, began successfully marketing porcelain enameled cast-iron bathtubs, a process that remains broadly the same to this day. Far from the ornate feet and luxury most associated with clawfoot tubs, an early Kohler example was advertised as a &quot;horse trough/hog scalder, when furnished with four legs will serve as a bathtub.&quot; The item&#x27;s use as a hog scalder was considered a more important marketing point than its ability to function as a bathtub.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the once popular clawfoot tub morphed into a built-in tub with a small apron front. This enclosed style afforded easier maintenance and, with the emergence of colored sanitary ware, more design options for the homeowner. The Crane Company introduced colored bathroom fixtures to the United States market in 1928, and slowly this influx of design options and easier cleaning and care led to the near demise of clawfoot-style tubs.

In the 1960s fiberglass bathtubs became the standard for homes, being lightweight and inexpensive.

James R. Wheeler and his brother Richard in 1979 adapted the acrylic being used for outdoor spas to make acrylic bathtubs. Working with Spartech Plastics, they developed the modern co-extruded and durable acrylic bathtub. The company American Bath Factory was the first to expand the diversity of acrylic bathtubs to include whirlpools, clawfoot bathtubs, and a large variety of pedestal and modern bathtubs.

The process for enamelling cast iron bathtubs was invented by the Scottish-born American David Dunbar Buick.

== Types ==


=== Clawfoot tub ===
The clawfoot tub was considered a luxury item in the late 19th century, originally made from cast iron and lined with porcelain. Modern technology has contributed to a drop in the price of clawfoot tubs, which may now be made of fiberglass, acrylic or other modern materials. Clawfoot tubs usually require more water than a standard bathtub, because generally they are larger. While true antique clawfoot tubs are still considered collectible items, new reproduction clawfoot tubs are chosen by remodelers and new home builders and much like the Western-style bathtubs, clawfoot tubs can also include a variety of shower head options.

Clawfoot tubs come in four major styles:
* Classic roll rim tubs, also called roll top tubs or flat rim tubs as seen in the picture at the top of this page.
* Slipper tubs, generally known as slipper baths in the UK, where one end is raised and sloped creating a more comfortable lounging position.
* Double slipper tubs – where both ends are raised and sloped.
* Double ended tubs – where both ends of the tub are rounded, as opposed to the classic roll rim tub, which has one rounded end and one fairly flat end.

=== Pedestal tubs ===
Pedestal tubs rest on a pedestal in what many would term an art deco style. Evidence of pedestal tubs dates back to the island of Crete around 1000 BC.

=== Baby bathtub ===
A baby bathtub is one used for bathing infants, especially those not yet old enough to sit up on their own. These can be either a small, stand-alone bath that is filled with water from another source, or a device for supporting the baby that is placed in a standard bathtub. Many are designed to allow the baby to recline while keeping its head out of the water.

=== Hot tubs ===

Hot tubs are common heated pools used for relaxation and sometimes for therapy. Hot tubs became popularized in the U.S. during the early hippie era (1967–1980), appearing in films and music.

=== Whirlpool tubs ===
Whirlpool tubs first became popular in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s. A spa or hot tub is also called a &quot;jacuzzi&quot; since the word became a generic after plumbing component manufacturer Jacuzzi introduced the &quot;Spa Whirlpool&quot; in 1968. Air bubbles may be introduced into the nozzles via an air-bleed venturi pump.

=== Freestand bathtubs ===
&quot;Freestanding tubs&quot; have become popular in recent years as a result of larger bathrooms being constructed. Freestanding bathtubs may be made from various materials such as stone resin, cast stone, acrylic, cast iron, fiberglass, porcelain, copper, and cement.

=== Soft bathtubs ===
&quot;Soft tubs&quot; are made from soft plastic or foam with a protective non-slip coating. While soft tubs have been available since the 1970s, by the 1990s they were being sold by major manufacturers. The tubs are typically marketed for children and the elderly, to prevent injury from falls.

=== Inflatable bathtubs ===
Inflatable bathtubs are portable bathtubs that can be used indoors and outdoors. Some models have built-in accessories such as pillows, backrests, armrests, and cupholders, which are all air-inflated. In general, inflatable bathtubs usually consist of many smaller inflatable parts, together forming a bathtub. Babies commonly use these to bathe, and some use an assortment of toys like rubber ducks.

<text>The 1st Canadian Division (French: &quot;1re Division du Canada&quot;) is a joint operational command and control formation based at CFB Kingston, and falls under Canadian Joint Operations Command. It is a high-readiness unit, able to move on very short notice, and is staffed and equipped to meet Canada&#x27;s military objectives to counter any potential threat.

Formed during the First World War in August 1914, the 1st Canadian Division was a formation of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. The division contained a cavalry squadron and a cyclist company, three infantry brigades (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigades, each of four battalions), representing all parts of Canada, three field artillery brigades (roughly equivalent to modern regiments) armed with 18-pounders and engineers, together with elements of the Army Service Corps and the Army Medical Corps.  The total war establishment of the division was 17,873 all ranks, with 4,943 horses.[1] During its service in the First World War, the division fought at Ypres, Festubert, the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Passchendaele and Amiens among other notable battles on the Western Front.

Following the war, the division was stood down, only to be re-mobilized as a formation on 1 September 1939 as the 1st Canadian Infantry Division for service in the Second World War. The division was part of the Allied campaign to invade Sicily, as well as their campaign on the Italian mainland, where they are associated with such notable battles as Ortona, the Liri Valley and the Gothic Line. The division reunited with the First Canadian Army in 1945 to participate in the liberation of the Western Netherlands before the end of the war in Europe.

The division was also reactivated twice during the Cold War: from 1953 to 1958, and again from 1988 to 1992.

In 2010, the division was reactivated for a third time. While the four divisions (2nd to 5th) of the Canadian Army are responsible for command of units within their respective geographic regions, the 1st Canadian Division Headquarters was formed to serve as a task-tailored, deployable joint headquarters at high readiness to command and control joint, inter-agency, multinational forces to achieve national objectives at home and abroad.

==First World War==

The First Contingent of the Canadian Expeditionary Force was raised in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Great War, concentrated at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and set off for England in the largest trans-Atlantic convoy to date two months later. Training and reorganization commenced upon arrival in the United Kingdom in October 1914, and it was not until 26 January 1915 that the division was officially organized, under the command of Lieutenant-General Edwin Alderson, a British Army officer. Several units under command of the First Contingent were excluded from the divisional organization, including the 17th Battalion (Nova Scotia Highlanders), 18th Battalion, and several companies of Newfoundland soldiers (later formed into the Newfoundland Regiment and assigned to the 29th Division).

The division consisted originally of a cavalry squadron, cyclist company, four infantry brigades, three artillery brigades (equivalent in terms of numbers to the regiments used in the Second World War and after) armed with 18-pounders, and divisional engineers, with supporting troops of the Canadian Army Service Corps and Canadian Army Medical Corps. The strength of the division was placed at 17,873 all ranks, with 4,943 horses. The 4th Brigade was broken up in January 1915, with one battalion (the 10th) going to the 2nd Brigade, and the other three battalions being used to form the Canadian Training Depot, ultimately being re-designated as &quot;Reserve&quot; Battalions. The 10th Battalion replaced the 6th Battalion (Fort Garrys), which left the 2nd Brigade to become a cavalry unit, later serving in the Canadian Cavalry Brigade.

Pioneer units were added later in the war, including the 1st Canadian Pioneer Battalion from March 1916 to February 1917, when they became the 9th Canadian Railway Battalion. The 107th Canadian Pioneer Battalion also came under command between March 1917 and May 1918, before being absorbed by the 1st Canadian Engineer Brigade.

Lieutenant-General Alderson was selected and appointed in October 1914 to command the new Canadian Division, as it was known at that time, making him the highest ranking divisional commander in the British Army. He was selected — to the relief of many — in lieu of Sir Sam Hughes, who was promoted at this time by the prime minister to the rank of Major-General. It had been Hughes&#x27;s wish to command the Canadians in action. Alderson, who had commanded Canadian units before, won out over three prospective Canadian appointees, who, while serving with the British Army, were still considered too inexperienced. Alderson, meanwhile, had first seen action against the Boers in 1881, and thereafter fought in Egypt, the Sudan (he served with a Camel Corps in the Nile Expedition of 1884–1885) and Mashonaland. He also served throughout the South African War of 1899–1902, in which he had Canadian mounted troops under his command.

Training in the winter of 1914 was rigorous, and conditions on Salisbury Plain were harsh due to cold and rain. Alderson rejected the &quot;shoddy&quot; kit that was supplied from Canada including the Ross Rifle which had been adopted due to the slow rate of supply of the Lee–Enfield and which was seen as an example of Canadian nationalism. A royal inspection of the division early in 1915 foretold a move to France.

Early in 1915, it was evident that the Canadians would soon be going to France. The division paraded in drill order for an inspection by His Majesty King George V; thereafter, units boarded troop ships at Avonmouth and during mid-February, the entire division crossed the rough Channel to St. Nazaire. After a brief period in reserve near Hazebrouck, the Canadians relieved the 7th British Division in the Fleurbaix sector near Armentières on 1–3 March. General Alderson then became responsible for of front line on the left flank of the First Army (General Sir Douglas Haig).

The division moved to the Ypres Salient in April, and faced its first real test during the defence of St. Julien beginning on 22 April. The Canadians withstood German attack — aided, for the first time on the Western Front, by the use of poison gas — and finally retired to secondary positions on 26 April, where they held on until 4 May. The Second Battle of Ypres, as the overall action came to be known, cost the infantry brigades some 5,506 men.

Two weeks later, the division was in action again at Festubert. Aiding in a diversionary offensive by the British armies, the Canadians suffered 2,204 casualties for gains of only . Another futile attack was launched at Givenchy-en-Gohelle in June 1915, after which the division moved to Ploegsteert.

The Canadians began a long period of static warfare which would last them throughout the winter. In September, the arrival of the 2nd Canadian Division meant that a national corps headquarters could take to the field to command the division. Major-General Arthur Currie took command of the division in September. Active operations resumed again in the spring of 1916, participating in the Battle of Mount Sorrel, and then restoring the situation at Sanctuary Wood.

The Battle of the Somme opened on 1 July 1916, the costliest day in the history of the British Army, with over 19,000 British soldiers killed and 38,000 wounded. The Canadian part in the battle, which was to last through to November, did not begin until September at Battle of Pozières and lasted through to October. It was on the Somme that the red patch was first worn as an identifying device—two inches by three inches and worn on both sleeves, this rectangle identified the wearer as belonging to the 1st Division. The insignia was also painted on steel trench helmets, and adorned with geometric shapes of different colours to further identify the soldier&#x27;s specific battery, brigade, battalion or other subunit.

The division began to prepare for the historic assault on Vimy Ridge, and took the time-honoured position of right of the line on 9 April 1917 when the corps took the ridge. Other gains were made in the days following the successful assault on the ridge, and the division participated in the battle of Hill 70 in August 1917. The Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) followed in mid-October, and fighting continued into November. The division served under Major-General Archibald Cameron Macdonell beginning in May; his command persisted until Armistice Day.

Massive German offensives came in the spring of 1918, but the Canadian Corps—now considered crack assault troops—were held in reserve for the inevitable counter-offensives. &quot;Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days&quot;—the last 100 days of the war—were marked by several Canadian successes, at Amiens, Arras (which included the Drocourt-Quéant Line), Canal du Nord and the Pursuit to Mons. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 finally brought the Great War to an end.

After the cessation of hostilities on 11 November 1918, the 1st Division was selected to form part of the occupation forces on the right bank of the Rhine, and General MacDonnell took the salute on 13 December when his veterans crossed the bridge at Cologne with fixed bayonets. During April 1919, the troops embarked and returned to Canada for demobilization. The total casualties of the infantry battalions were 52,559, of which 15,055 (nearly the original strength of the entire division) were fatal. Twenty-four soldiers of the division were awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Second World War (1939–1945)==
The division was remobilized in September 1939, designated as the 1st Canadian Division, before Canada&#x27;s formal entrance into the Second World War, to be later joined by both the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions. The division, under the command of Major General Andrew McNaughton, left Halifax from Pier 21 in two heavily escorted convoys. The first departed on 10 December, three months after the declaration of war, and the second departed on 22 December 1939, with additional troops reaching England in February 1940. In 1941, the formation adopted the red rectangular battle patch insignia worn by the 1st Canadian Division in the Great War.

All elements of the division were far from completely equipped on mobilization: of the artillery and machine guns on hand, most were obsolete, and the troops lacked steel helmets. Only gradually did a full complement of more modern weapons, equipment, and transport begin reaching the division in 1940.

Nevertheless, in the wake of the disastrous Battle of France and the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, the 1st Canadian Division was ordered to France the following month. Among the infantry units that landed at Brest were The Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR), The 48th Highlanders of Canada and The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, all part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade. Members of the RCR were present in France at least until 16 June, after the French capital of Paris had fallen to German forces, and returned almost immediately after. The 48th&#x27;s withdrawal was not without some excitement.

The division returned to England for the defence of Great Britain in the case of a German invasion. Soon afterwards, Major General McNaughton was promoted to command of the British VII Corps (later designated the Canadian Corps) and was succeeded by Major General George Pearkes. In January 1943, the division was redesignated &quot;1st Canadian Infantry Division.&quot;

The division transferred to the Mediterranean theatre in June 1943 where the division, now under the command of Major General Guy Simonds after Major General Harry Salmon (who had taken command in September 1942) was killed in an air crash, took part in Operation Husky, code name for the Allied assault landing on Sicily on 10 July 1943, which ended after just 28 days. The division came under command of the British XXX Corps, serving alongside the veteran 51st (Highland) Division, part of the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. The campaign cost the division over 2,100 casualties, with 562 Canadians killed in action.

Soon after the conquest of Sicily, the division transferred to the British XIII Corps, but now serving alongside the British 5th Infantry Division (which had also fought in Husky), then landed in Calabria as part of Operation Baytown on the Italian mainland and fought its way up the Italian peninsula, advancing to the other side of the boot (the “heel”), before withdrawing from the front lines where it fought an occasional rearguard action. The division was put back into the front lines to participate in the Moro River Campaign. The division, now under Major General Chris Vokes, supported by tanks of the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, took part in the Battle of Ortona, fighting against German Fallschirmjäger–crack air force paratroops of the 1st Parachute Division–over Christmas 1943. Both sides suffered heavy losses in the fight for the town, which a reporter for The New York Times had begun calling a &quot;miniature Stalingrad&quot;, based on the ferocity of the street fighting and the heavy losses on both sides, with the Canadians suffering 650 casualties, mainly in the 3rd Brigade. By 27 December, what remained of Ortona, after days of shelling and aerial bombardment, was in Canadian hands.

After this, the division was rested and many months of static warfare ensued. The division then went on to break out of the Eighth Army&#x27;s bridgehead with the second wave in the spring offensive, Operation Diadem, the Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino. The 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, the reconnaissance (or &#x27;recce&#x27;) regiment serving with the 1st Canadian Division, was the first of the Eighth Army&#x27;s units to cross the Hitler Line in May 1944, below Pontecorvo in its armoured cars.

After heavy fighting in front of the Gothic Line throughout the summer, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division spent the next several months fighting, as it had the previous fall, for a succession of heavily defended river crossings surrounded by high ground. By the time the division reached the Senio, as the icy rain began giving way to snow in the Canadian sector, a decision had been reached to transfer the entire I Canadian Corps, 1st Infantry Division included, to the Netherlands. By the end of March 1945, all Canadian Army units serving with Allied Forces Mediterranean (formerly the Allied Armies in Italy) had been transferred to the Western Front and Operation Goldflake, the reunion of the 1st Infantry Division and 1st Armoured Brigade and First Canadian Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar, was accomplished. The division, now under Major General Harry Foster, went on to take part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, the liberation of a majority of the Netherlands including the liberation of Arnhem, and the war in Europe came to an end soon after, on 8 May 1945, Victory in Europe Day. The headquarters of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division was officially disbanded on 15 September 1945.

Three members of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division were awarded the Victoria Cross during the Italian Campaign. They were Captain Paul Triquet of the Royal 22e Régiment, Major John Keefer Mahony of The Westminster Regiment and Private Ernest &quot;Smoky&quot; Smith of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada.

==Cold War==
In the post-war reorganization of reserve units, a &quot;Headquarters 1st Infantry Division&quot; (later re-designated &quot;Headquarters 1st Division&quot;) was authorized on 1 April 1946. It remained dormant, however, and was formally disbanded on 21 July 1954. In the meantime, a new Headquarters 1st Canadian Infantry Division had been authorized as part of the Canadian Army Active Force on 16 October 1953, and this headquarters was established the following December.

Major-General J.M. Rockingham, CB, CBE, DSO and bar, ED, took command of the 1st Division on 1 September 1954. His Division contained the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade, stationed in Germany, the 2nd at Edmonton and the 3rd at Valcartier, with normal supporting arms and services.

The life of this division was short as on 5 December 1957, the Minister of National Defence announced in the House of Commons that the divisional headquarters would be reduced to nil strength. Shortly thereafter, General Rockingham was transferred to Quebec Command and on 30 April 1958, the Headquarters of 1st Canadian Infantry Division was disbanded.

In 1988, a new era for the division began when the Government of Canada announced the intention to consolidate its military commitments to Europe in the Central Region. The reformation in November 1989 followed the Canadian government&#x27;s decision to end the Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group (CAST) commitment to reinforce Northern Norway. 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, based in Quebec, was thus available for other tasks. The CAST rapid-reinforcement commitment had been encountering problems, most graphically demonstrated during Exercise Brave Lion in 1986, which prompted Canada to start formal consultations with NATO about consolidating the CAST Brigade and 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, based in southern Germany. The two separate forces would have meant critical logistical and medical support needs would have gone unmet in case of real war. The hole thus created by the removal of the CAST Brigade Group was filled, to a degree, by the creation of a NATO Composite Force (NCF) to which Canada promised a battalion group.

The headquarters was established, with both 4 Brigade and 5 Brigade under command, at Kingston, Ontario, with a forward detachment at Lahr in Germany where 4 Brigade was based. The main headquarters was intended to move gradually from Kingston to Lahr over a period of time, though this never, in the event, took place. With the division having only two brigades, it was assumed that in wartime, either a German or US brigade would be assigned to provide the necessary third manoeuvre element. Although during NATO command post exercises a divisional order of battle was used that nominally included the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group as the third Maneuver brigade, field training and exercises were conducted with this notion in mind. Some changes were necessary to the two brigades, as 5 Brigade had only three-quarters of 4 Brigade&#x27;s personnel and equipment with the support organizations held at the divisional level. Once reinforcements had arrived from Canada, each brigade would have had one small armoured regiment (two squadrons, each 20 tanks), and two four-company infantry battalions. Divisional troops would have been a mix of former 4 Brigade and 5 Brigade units along with some troops from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group in western Canada. 3rd Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery was intended to have been re-equipped with the MLRS to provide general support, while a further engineer regiment, 6 Combat Engineer Regiment, was to have been formed. The Fort Garry Horse was also to have been re-formed to provide a divisional reconnaissance capability. As finally envisaged CENTAG wartime structure in 1989, the division was assigned to the Central Army Group Commander&#x27;s tactical reserve, performing operations in support of either II (German) Corps or VII US Corps. From 1988 to 1992, the Division Headquarters focused on the training of its subordinate formations culminating in the last two of the &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot; series of exercises in 1989 and 1992 where the division deployed to CFB Wainwright and functioned as a headquarters in the field.

As it became obvious that the Soviet threat was disappearing in the early 1990s, the future options for Canadian forces in Europe were increasingly debated. While a battalion-sized remaining Canadian force was discussed, eventually it was decided that all Canadian land forces would leave Germany by 1994. With units disbanding around them, Division Headquarters (Forward) was repatriated to CFB Kingston on 13 June 1992, and at this time the presence of the 1st Division in Germany effectively ended. Though continuing to provide command and control capability for any multi-brigade deployment, emphasis was shifted to the joint role where the Division HQ would provide command and control of CF or multinational forces in humanitarian, UN, NATO or coalition operations. Subsequently, the successful December 1992 deployment of the Division Headquarters to Somalia in this role validated the need for this capability in the Army.

Back in Kingston, the division&#x27;s aegis was reduced to two units; a new 1st Canadian Division HQ and Signals Regiment (which incorporated Division HQ) and the 1st Canadian Division Intelligence Company (1 Cdn Div Int Coy). Its new role was to be capable of deploying a land-based, Joint Task Force Headquarters at division level or a Joint Force Headquarters consisting of navy, army and air force personnel for territorial defence, contingencies and other missions including complex international scenarios. The Division HQ would train formation HQs, plan for contingencies and command assigned forces in crisis situations. The HQ had in priority, four roles operations, training, support and planning.

Headquarters 1st Canadian Division was transformed on 1 April 2000 into Canadian Forces Joint Headquarters and 1st Canadian Division Headquarters and Signal Regiment was united with 79 Communication Regiment to form the Canadian Forces Joint Signal Regiment. Both units, who remained headquartered in Kingston, were assigned as elements of Canadian Expeditionary Force Command as the deployable command headquarters for all large Canadian overseas deployments.

==Reactivation==
On 19 May 2010, Chief of the Defence Staff, General Walter Natynczyk, announced that the Canadian Forces would once again stand up the 1st Canadian Division at Kingston, Ontario. The role of 1st Canadian Division upon reactivation was to provide the Canadian Forces with a rapidly deployable joint command and control capacity in order to allow for a comprehensive approach to operations. As planning for the revitalised Division progressed, the HQ was tasked at very short notice to deploy to Malta as a Joint Task Force Headquarters on Operation MOBILE to coordinate the evacuation of Canadians and other civilians from Libya – a successful mission where personnel from both Canada and other nations were evacuated.

1st Cdn Div HQ officially was stood up on 7 October 2010 at Kingston, with Defence Minister Peter MacKay acting as the reviewing officer. Headquarters 1st Canadian Division is part of the Canadian Army administratively and remains at Canadian Forces Base Kingston using existing infrastructure and base support. Major-General David Fraser, former Commandant of the Canadian Forces College in Toronto and the first Canadian commander of the Multi-National Brigade (Regional Command (South)) in Afghanistan, was designated as the first commander of the newly reactivated 1st Canadian Division. 

On 1 April 2015, 1st Canadian Division was transferred from the Canadian Army to Canadian Joint Operations Command.

<doc id="811256" wikidata="Q946831" url="?curid=811256" title="South Harrow tube station">
<text>South Harrow is a London Underground station in South Harrow, north-west London. It is on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line between Rayners Lane and Sudbury Hill stations. It is located on Northolt Road (A312). The station is in Travelcard Zone 5. There are several bus stands outside the station as well as overnight train stabling sidings.

==History==
South Harrow station was opened on 28 June 1903 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) as the terminus of its new extension from Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey.

This new extension was, together with the existing tracks back to Acton Town, the first section of the Underground&#x27;s surface lines to be electrified and operate electric instead of steam trains. The Deep level tube lines open at that time (City &amp; South London Railway, Waterloo &amp; City Railway and Central London Railway) had been electrically powered from the start.

On 1 March 1910, the DR was extended north to meet the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) tracks at Rayners Lane and services commenced over the MR&#x27;s tracks to Uxbridge. North of the station the line crosses the Roxeth Marsh; the viaduct over it between South Harrow and Rayners Lane was an engineering feat of the time.

On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly line was extended to run west of its original terminus at Hammersmith sharing the route with the District line to Ealing Common. From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line. From South Harrow north, an isolated District line service continued to operate to Uxbridge until 22 October 1933 when the Piccadilly line took over the service to Uxbridge.

The original station building is located approximately 170m south of the existing station and can be accessed from South Hill Avenue. It is similar to the building still in use at North Ealing and remains, adjacent to the eastbound platform, in the car park on the north side of the tracks. Today it is used by London Underground as office space for drivers before and after stabling trains in the sidings and driver shift changes. On 5 July 1935, a new station was opened accessed from Northolt Road. The new station building was designed by Charles Holden as a graduated structure stepping up on each side to the platforms of the high level tracks. The brick walls and bands of horizontal glazing are capped with a series of flat concrete slab roofs.

== Stabling Sidings ==
The 5 west facing dead ended sidings are located to the east of South Harrow and are accessed from both platforms via a pair of crossovers. They are mainly used to stable stock at the close of service as well as engineering trains subject to requirement.

Until the summer of 2015, nine cars of ex-Jubilee Line 1983 Stock were stored there following withdrawal in 1998 in preparation for the Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) and the introduction of the 1996 Stock. The units, which had been out of service for seventeen years, were in a heavily vandalised condition, having spent longer in storage than their fourteen years in operational service on the Jubilee line. All nine carriages were removed for scrapping on the weekend of 27/28 June 2015, which involved being craned onto low loaders during a weekend closure. The stabling capacity was required to facilitate the introduction of the Night Tube on certain parts of the Piccadilly line.

Also stabled in the sidings between 1999 and 2004 was a 1972 (Mark I) tube stock train. This train was unit 3227 and was painted in an experimental livery of blue doors and red cab ends. Like the 1983 tube stocks, it suffered vandalism. This unit was withdrawn from the Northern line after failing at Edgware and it was removed in 2004 and sent to MOD Shoeburyness for storage and scrapping. Another 1972 Mark I unit (3205) in the original condition was stored at the sidings, but this has also been scrapped. A third unit of 1972 stock was stored but that one was immediately stored at the disused Aldwych branch for filming purposes.

==Services==
The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)
*3tph to Rayners Lane (Westbound)
*3tph to Uxbridge via Rayners Lane (Westbound)

The peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*12tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)
*6tph to Rayners Lane (Westbound)
*6tph to Uxbridge via Rayners Lane (Westbound)

==Connections==
London Buses routes 114, 140, 258, 395, 398, 487, H9, H10, H12, N140 and SL9 serve the station.

<doc id="811269" wikidata="Q7923105" url="?curid=811269" title="Very special episode">
<text>&quot;Very special episode&quot; is an advertising term originally used in American television promos to refer to an episode of a sitcom or drama series which deals with a difficult or controversial social issue. The usage of the term peaked in the 1980s.

==Overview and legacy==
===History===
Traditionally, very special episodes contained either a brief message from the cast or a title card reading either &quot;Viewer Discretion Advised&quot; or &quot;Parental Discretion Advised&quot;, alerting viewers to the potentially graphic or disturbing nature of the episode and giving them time to decide if they wanted to watch it.

===Topics===
Popular topics covered in very special episodes include abortion, birth control, sex education, racism, sexism, death, narcotics, pregnancy (particularly teenage pregnancy and unintended pregnancy), asthma, hitchhiking, kidnapping, suicide, drunk driving, drug use, sexual abuse, child abuse, child abandonment, sexual assault, violence, cults and HIV/AIDS.

===Portrayals===
How a topic is portrayed can vary drastically from show to show, and its portrayal is influenced by a number of factors, including the personal beliefs of those involved in the show, advertising concerns, cultural attitudes, and the show&#x27;s format, genre, and broadcasting company. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; summarizes the core values of a very special episode as thus:The main characters beloved by viewers would inevitably avoid serious harm. The dangers posed by story lines were more threats than actual occurrences, and on the occasion that bad things did happen, they usually happened to ancillary characters whom audiences cared less about. This selective meting of moral justice kept lessons from becoming too morbid, while still allowing episodes to serve as cautionary tales.

===Public reception===
The purpose of a very special episode is generally to raise awareness of an issue and encourage those affected to seek help if necessary. For example, the &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; episode &quot;The Bicycle Man&quot;, in the same year it was released, influenced a child in La Porte, Indiana, to inform his mother of a pedophile in the area, and the LaPorte police department credited the episode for the man&#x27;s arrest. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the episode &quot;a calm, careful and intelligent treatment of a difficult and potentially traumatizing subject. There seems little possibility that watching this program would do children harm, and considerable likelihood it could do them good.&quot;

===In popular culture===
Comedian Frank Caliendo spoofed this concept with &quot;TV Promos&quot; and &quot;A Very Special Seinfeld&quot; on his 2002 album &quot;Make the Voices Stop&quot;.

Notably, Larry David, producer and co-creator of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, was reportedly strongly opposed to having a very special episode in the series, with the motto of writers and cast being &quot;No hugging, no learning&quot;.

The concept was also spoofed on the 1996 &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;A Very Very Very Very Special Show&quot; where Yakko, Wakko and Dot attempt to teach politically correct lessons in order to win a Humanitarian Animation Award.

<doc id="811271" wikidata="Q6852083" url="?curid=811271" title="Military Merit Medal (Vietnam)">
<text>The Military Merit Medal () was the highest military decoration bestowed to enlisted personnel by the Republic of Vietnam during the years of the Vietnam War. The medal was established on August 15, 1950. The Military Merit Medal was modeled after the French Médaille Militaire and was awarded mostly to enlisted men for valor in combat. The medal had three different versions, coincided with the political change in South Vietnam: the State of Vietnam, the First Republic, and the Second Republic version. The Vietnamese National Order of Vietnam was considered the equivalent decoration for military officers.

==Award Criteria==
&quot;The Military Merit Medal is awarded or awarded posthumously to Non-Commissioned Officers (including Aspirants) and Enlisted Men in the Armed Forces, who have:
*Previously received citations at the Armed Forces level.
*Been wounded once or many times in combat.
*Distinguished themselves by their heroic actions.
*Served in an honorable manner for at least 13 years.

&quot;The Military Merit Medal may be awarded or posthumously awarded to Allied Non-Commissioned Officers and Enlisted Men for valor while fighting the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam.&quot;

==Acceptance and wear by allied forces==
The United States military authorized the Military Merit Medal as a foreign decoration and permitted the medal to be worn on U.S. uniforms by enlisted personnel. A high number of Military Merit Medals were issued posthumously as the medal was most often awarded to United States servicemen who were killed in action. The Military Merit Medal was last issued to U.S. personnel in 1973 and was discontinued after the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. The decoration is now only available through private dealers in military insignia.

==Meritorious Citation==

The Meritorious citation for the posthumous award of the Military Merit Medal:

&quot;Servicemen of courage and rare self-sacrifice, they displayed at all times the most tactful cooperation while aiding the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam to repel the Red wave undermining South Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

With a ready zeal and commendable responsibility, they fought on to the end in every mission and set a brilliant example for their fellow soldiers.

They died in the performance of duty. Behind them they leave the abiding grief of their former comrades-in-arms, Vietnamese as well as American.&quot;

Many posthumous awards of the Military Merit Medal to American servicemen included the Vietnamese &quot;Gallantry Cross with Palm&quot;.

<doc id="811273" wikidata="Q2815839" url="?curid=811273" title="2nd Canadian Division">
<text>The 2nd Canadian Division (2 Cdn Div; ) is a formation of the Canadian Army in the province of Quebec, Canada. The present command was created 2013 when Land Force Quebec Area was re-designated. The main unit housed in this division is the Royal 22nd Regiment based at CFB Valcartier near Quebec City, which is the largest regiment in the Canadian Army.

The division draws its historical lineage from formations that existed during the First and Second World Wars.

== History ==

During the First World War, the division fought on the Western Front before being disbanded in 1919. It was reformed on 1 September 1939, as part of the First Canadian Army, at the outbreak of the Second World War, adopting the designation &quot;2nd Canadian Infantry Division&quot;. It was initially composed of volunteers within brigades established along regional lines, though a halt in recruitment in the early months of the war caused a delay in the formation of brigade and divisional headquarters. With questions concerning overseas deployment resolved, the division&#x27;s respective commands were formed in May and June 1940, and at British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s request, the division was deployed to the United Kingdom between 1 August and 25 December 1940.

Having performed well in training exercises during 1941 and early 1942, elements of the 2nd Division were selected as the main force for Operation Jubilee, a large-scale amphibious raid on the port of Dieppe in German-occupied France. On 19 August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division&#x27;s 4th and 6th brigades assaulted Dieppe&#x27;s beaches. The Germans were well prepared and, despite being reinforced, the Canadians sustained heavy losses and had to be evacuated, fewer than half their number returning to the United Kingdom.

Following a period of reconstruction and retraining in 1942–44, the division joined II Canadian Corps as part of the Second British Army for the Allied Invasion of Normandy. 2nd Division saw significant action from 20 July to 21 August in the battles for Caen and Falaise. Joining the newly activated headquarters of the First Canadian Army in the assault on northwestern Europe, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division played a significant role in the retaking of the Channel ports, the Battle of the Scheldt, and the liberation of the Netherlands. The division was deactivated shortly after the end of the war.

===First World War===

The formation of the 2nd Canadian Division began in May 1915 in Britain, following the arrival of a large contingent of soldiers from Canada. The 2nd Division remained in Great Britain only a short time before embarking for the Western Front in September 1915. It joined the 1st Canadian Division to form the Canadian Corps. The division was under the command of Major General R.E.W. Turner, and its members spent a long and bitterly cold winter in a Belgian section of the front between Ploegsteert Wood and St. Eloi, south of Ypres. The 2nd Canadian Division served on the Western Front until the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

===Second World War===
====Formation and early organization (1939)====
At the start of the Second World War, the Canadian Active Service Force was initially composed of two divisions; the 1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Divisions, both raised on the first of September 1939. The fighting power of this force lay in its constituent infantry brigades, of which each division had three. These were in turn composed of three rifle and one machine gun battalion, with additional divisional artillery and engineer units in support.

The 2nd Division, like its sister formation, was originally organized along regional lines. Its 4th Brigade was composed of regiments from Ontario, the 5th Brigade of regiments from Quebec, and 6th Brigade of regiments from Western Canada.

====Garrison duties and reorganization (1940)====

It was over a year before the 2nd Division came together as a cohesive unit and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made. The first brigade concentrations took place in May and June 1940, until which time all units had trained in their own garrisons. The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.

The 2nd Division&#x27;s structure was altered in early 1940, reducing its number of machine-gun battalions from three to one. The Camerons and the Chaudières (now a rifle battalion) were reassigned to the newly mobilized 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, and the Winnipeg Grenadiers were sent to Jamaica for garrison duty, after which they returned to Canada then redeployed to Hong Kong, where they were captured when it fell to the Japanese on 25 December 1941.

In May 1940, The Black Watch were moved from Valcartier to Newfoundland, and in June, the 2nd Division was earmarked for garrison duty by the forces of the British Commonwealth, with the Royal Regiment of Canada and &quot;Les Fusiliers Mont Royal&quot; arriving in Iceland later that month. However, at the request of Winston Churchill these deployments were cut short, as the division was badly needed in England to supplement the British Army—then facing the imminent possibility of German invasion.

As a result, most of the 2nd Division&#x27;s units were sent to the United Kingdom in August 1940, although the Iceland garrison remained in place until 31 October. The absence of the &quot;Mont Royal&quot;s allowed Major-General Victor Odlum to reassign the Calgary Highlanders to the 5th Brigade in September, in an attempt to ethnically mix the brigades of the division.

====Training in the United Kingdom (1941)====

In 1941, the Toronto Scottish Regiment was transferred from the 1st Division to become the machine-gun battalion of the 2nd Division. Around the same time, the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars) was raised from 2nd Division personnel supplemented by reinforcements from Canada. Due to equipment shortages, it was often difficult to adequately supply newly arrived divisions in England. Artillery units had to make use of outmoded 75 mm guns with steel tires, and a lack of anti-aircraft guns—diverted to civil defense during the height of the Battle of Britain—left Canadian units to fend for themselves with small arms. However, by February 1941, enough Bren guns had been issued to the infantry units and, by September, the artillery had been equipped with 25-pounder (84 mm, 3.3-in) howitzers, although signals equipment and transport were still lacking and anti-tank guns were dangerously scarce.

When the division was not engaged in coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training took the form of increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14 to 16 June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with I Canadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29 September to 3 October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.

On 30 December 1941, the Calgary Highlanders introduced &quot;battle drill&quot; to the division. This new type of training emphasized small unit tactics as well as &quot;hardening&quot; training through use of live ammunition, slaughterhouse visits, and obstacle courses, and was adopted throughout Commonwealth forces stationed in Britain.

====Operation Jubilee (1942)====

In early 1942, under Major General J. H. Roberts, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division participated in several additional full-scale combat exercises, again gauging the ability of Commonwealth divisions to repel a possible German invasion. As April and May progressed, the exercises intensified, becoming significantly more demanding on the participants. As a result, the 2nd Division was judged to be one of the four best divisions in the United Kingdom, and was selected as the primary force for the upcoming Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe—codenamed Operation Jubilee. Mounted as a test of whether or not such a landing was feasible, the Dieppe raid was to be undertaken by the 4th and 6th Brigades, with additional naval, air, and infantry support. Significant elements of the 5th Brigade were also involved.

On 19 August 1942, while British commando units attacked bunker positions on the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division landed on four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was situated at the foot of a sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the Black Watch, was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders. Only six percent of the men that landed on Blue Beach returned to Britain.

The main beaches, codenamed White and Red, lay in front of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the majority of the 4th and 6th brigades became pinned down on the beach, and despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)), casualties were heavy. Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than half were killed, wounded or captured.

At Green Beach to the west, part of the South Saskatchewan Regiment was landed on the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was captured but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.

====Rebuilding (1942–1944)====
Throughout 1943, the 2nd Division focused on rebuilding its ranks, having lost close to half its strength at Dieppe. General Roberts remained in command of the division until an unsatisfactory handling of the division in an army-level scheme caused his ouster. In January 1944, Major General Charles Foulkes—the first to command the division who had not served in the First World War—replaced Burns. The following month, all three brigade commanders were replaced as part of a general move to modernize the Canadian forces&#x27; higher echelons; further sweeping changes throughout all levels of command, coupled with the lingering effects of the large influx of new personnel during 1943, lowered morale in the division. However, in March 1944, training again intensified, heralding the coming invasion of Europe. On 9 March, the 2nd Division was inspected by King George VI, and by May the division numbered close to 18,000 fully equipped and trained soldiers. When D-Day arrived on 6 June 1944, the main Canadian assault was led by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, while the 2nd Division was held in reserve.

====Battle of Normandy====
The Canadian attack of the Juno beach was the most successful of the five beaches attacked on D-day. Having successfully landed in Normandy, Allied forces soon became embroiled in battles against German armour and were unable to significantly expand their beachhead; by the time the 2nd Division came ashore at the end of the first week of July, the entire front had congealed. As the division assembled its brigades for combat, Anglo-Canadian forces launched Operation Charnwood. It was a tactical success, but could not clear all Caen of its German defenders. Although originally a D-Day objective, Caen proved a difficult prize, holding out until 19 July when it finally fell to British forces during Operation Goodwood. In the aftermath, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery ordered elements of II Canadian Corps to push forward towards Verrières Ridge, the dominant geographical feature between Caen and Falaise. By keeping up the pressure, Montgomery hoped to divert German attention away from the American sector to the west.

=====Operation Atlantic=====
Operation Atlantic, launched on 18 July alongside Goodwood, had the objectives of securing the western bank of the Orne River and Verrières Ridge. 2nd Division&#x27;s 5th and 6th brigades were selected as the assaulting forces, with the 5th Brigade focusing on the Orne and the 6th on Verrières. The 4th Brigade were tasked with securing the flank of the operation, and The Royal Regiment of Canada attacked Louvigny on 18 July. Early on 19 July, The Calgary Highlanders seized Point 67, directly north of Verrières Ridge, and the following morning the Royal Highland Regiment of Canada crossed the Orne River and secured the flanks of the advance. In the afternoon, the 6th Brigade&#x27;s South Saskatchewan Regiment attacked the well-entrenched German positions on the ridge, with support from Typhoon fighter-bombers and tanks. However, the attack ran into torrential rain, and the Germans counterattacked in force. This and further German attacks inflicted heavy casualties on the South Saskatchewan Regiment and its supporting battalions, The Essex Scottish Regiment and The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders. On 21 July, the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade reinforced Canadian positions on Point 67. In two days of fighting, the division suffered 1,349 casualties.

=====Operation Spring=====
On 22 July 1944, Montgomery elected to use the Anglo-Canadian forces south of Caen in an all-out offensive aimed at breaking the German defensive cordon keeping his forces bottled up in Normandy. To meet Montgomery&#x27;s objectives, Canadian General Guy Simonds, commander of II Canadian Corps, was ordered to design a large breakout assault, codenamed Operation Spring. The attack was planned in three tightly timed phases of advance, pitting two Canadian and two British divisions against three German SS-Panzer divisions. It would be launched in conjunction with an American offensive, Operation Cobra, scheduled to take place on 25 July 1944.

The 4th Brigade attacked in the east with some success, taking Verrières village itself, but were repulsed at Tilly-la-Campagne by German counterattacks. The 5th Brigade, in the centre, made a bid for Fontenay-le-Marmion; of the 325 members of the Black Watch who left the start-lines, only 15 answered evening roll-call. German counterattacks on 26 and 27 July pushed Canadian forces back to Point 67. However, the situation eventually eased as the planned American offensive got underway. Throughout the first week of August, significant German resources were transferred from the Anglo-Canadian front to that of the Third United States Army, while reinforcements moved from Pas de Calais to the Falaise, Calvados area. By 7 August 1944, only one major formation—the 12th SS Panzer Division—faced Canadian forces on Verrières Ridge.

=====Operation &quot;Totalize&quot;=====
By 1 August 1944, the British had made significant gains on the Vire and Orne Rivers during Operation Bluecoat, while the Americans had achieved a complete breakthrough in the west. On 4 August, Simonds and General Harry Crerar—the newly appointed commander of the First Canadian Army—were given the order to prepare an advance on Falaise. Three days later, with heavy bomber support, Operation Totalize began, marking the first use of Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers. While the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked east of the Caen-Falaise Road, 2nd Division attacked to the west. By noon Verrières Ridge had finally fallen, and Canadian and Polish armour was preparing to exploit south towards Falaise. However, strong resistance by the 12th SS Panzer Division and the 272nd &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; Division halted the advance. Although 12 km (7.5 mi) of ground had been gained, Canadian forces had failed to reach Falaise itself.

Simultaneously, the Germans had launched a desperate and ill-prepared armoured thrust towards Mortain, beginning on 6 August 1944. This was halted within a day and, despite the increasingly dangerous threat presented by the Anglo-Canadian advance on Falaise, German commander Field Marshal Günther von Kluge was prohibited by Adolf Hitler from redeploying his forces. Thus, as American armoured formations advanced towards Argentan from the south, the Allies were presented with an opportunity to encircle large sections of the German Seventh Army. The First Canadian Army was ordered south, while the Americans prepared to move on Chambois on 14 August. Simonds and Crerar quickly planned a further offensive that would push through to Falaise, trapping the German Seventh Army in Normandy.

=====Operation Tractable=====
On 14 August, the First Canadian Army launched Operation Tractable with the aim of capturing Falaise and achieving a linkup with American forces in Chambois. A daylight attack was executed after artillery provided smoke-screen cover and medium bombers softened up the German defenses. The offensive was largely successful and, although the 2nd Division was not an active participant, divisional troops entered Falaise on 16 August as the remainder of First Canadian Army moved south-east towards Trun and Chambois. By 21 August the remnants of the battered German Seventh Army had surrendered in the Falaise Pocket, bringing the Battle of Normandy to a close. The German forces committed to Normandy since D-Day had been virtually annihilated—by the end of Operation Tractable, the 12th SS Panzer Division, the main adversary of the Canadians, had lost 80% of its tanks, 70% of its personnel carriers, and 60% of its artillery.

Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Division moved to Foret de la Londe, along the valley of the River Seine. From 27 to 29 August, the 4th and 6th Brigades were engaged in heavy fighting against the rearguard of German forces seeking to withdraw across the Seine.

====Channel Ports and the Scheldt====

Throughout September and October 1944, the First Canadian Army moved along the coast of France with the aim of securing the Channel ports. On 1 September, while the 3rd Division made for Boulogne and Calais, the 2nd Division entered Dieppe, encountering virtually no resistance. Five days later they were tasked by Montgomery and Crerar with retaking Dunkirk. Heavy fighting around the outskirts would hold the division for several days but, by 9 September, 5th Brigade had captured the port. The Dunkirk perimeter was handed over to the British on 15 September, and the 2nd Division made for Antwerp.

Although the Belgian White Brigade and elements of the 3rd British Division had entered Antwerp as early as 6 September, taking the city and docks, a strategic oversight meant that the nearby bridges over the Albert Canal were not seized, leaving the Germans in control of the Scheldt estuary. The failure to make an immediate push on the estuary ensured the strategically vital port would remain useless until the Scheldt was cleared. Strong formations of the Fifteenth German Army, which had withdrawn from the Pas de Calais, were able to consolidate their positions on the islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, as well as the Albert Canal directly northwest of Antwerp, and were further reinforced by elements of General Kurt Student&#x27;s First Parachute Army.

During the initial phases of the battle, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division sought to force a crossing of the Albert Canal. On 2 October, the entire First Canadian Army—under the temporary command of General Simonds—moved against the German defenses. Two days later, 2nd Division had cleared the canal, and was moving northwest towards South Beveland and Walcheren Island. On Friday, 13 October, later known as &quot;Black Friday&quot;, 5th Brigade&#x27;s Black Watch attacked positions near the coast, losing all four company commanders and over 200 men. Three days later, the Calgary Highlanders conducted a more successful offensive, capturing the initial objective of Woensdrecht. Simultaneously, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 4th Canadian Armoured Division captured Bergen, cutting off South Beveland and Walcheren from reinforcement.

====Battles for the Rhine (November 1944 – March 1945)====
By November 1944, the First Canadian Army had entered the Nijmegen Salient which was being held for use in the development of future offensives. The 2nd Division came under the command of Major-General A.B. Matthews, with Foulkes being transferred to command I Canadian Corps. The First Canadian Army launched no major offensive operations from November 1944 – January 1945; the longest hiatus the Canadians had enjoyed since landing on the Normandy beaches the previous June.

Operation Veritable was designed to bring the 21st Army Group to the west bank of the Rhine River, the last natural obstacle before entering Germany. Initially scheduled for December 1944, the operation was delayed until February by the German Ardennes Offensive. Plans were developed to breach three successive defensive lines: the outpost screen; a formidable section of the Siegfried Line running through the Hochwald Forest; and finally the Hochwald Layback covering the approach to the ultimate objective of Xanten. The first phase began on 8 February 1945, with the 2nd Division&#x27;s advance following up one of the largest artillery barrages seen on the Western Front. The Germans had prepared significant defenses in depth, both within the outpost screen and the Siegfried Line itself, and to add to the Canadians&#x27; difficulties, constant rain and cold weather obscured the battlefield. However, by the end of the first day, the 2nd Division had captured their objectives—the fortified towns of Wyler and Den Heuvel. On 11 February, the division moved southeast to assist XXX British Corps in their assault on Moyland Wood.

The operational plan&#x27;s second phase called for the 2nd and 3rd Divisions to take the Hochwald Forest. Following its capture, the 4th Canadian Armoured would sweep through the Hochwald Gap towards Wesel, followed by 2nd Division &quot;leap-frogging&quot; towards Xanten. Operation Blockbuster was scheduled for 27 February, but despite initial gains, stubborn German resistance prolonged the battle for six days. It was not until 3 March that the forest was cleared—during the intense close-quarter fighting, Major Frederick Tilston of the Essex Scottish Regiment won a Victoria Cross.

Operation Blockbuster&#x27;s final phase was the attack on Xanten itself, which lasted from 8–10 March. This fell primarily to the 2nd Division and 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade, although the 43rd Wessex Division was temporarily assigned to Simonds&#x27;s II Canadian Corps for the assault. Despite an elaborate preceding artillery barrage, dogged German resistance caused the battle to degenerate into one of attrition. Because effective air-support was prevented by fog and movement was hindered by German mortar barrages, the Anglo-Canadians suffered heavy casualties. However, by 10 March, the 2nd Division&#x27;s 5th Brigade had linked up with elements of the 52nd Lowland Division, bringing the offensive to a close. Total Canadian casualties during Veritable and Blockbuster were 5,304 killed or wounded.

====North of the Rhine (March – May 1945)====

Canadian forces having incurred heavy casualties in clearing a path to the Rhine, the 2nd Division was rested from the massive crossing operation that took place on 23 March 1945, instead crossing in relative ease a week later. After a brief detour through German territory, the First Canadian Army—now unified with the arrival of I Canadian Corps from Italy—prepared to assault German positions in the Netherlands. The 2nd Division moved northwards towards Groningen. In the nine days preceding their attack, German resistance had been light and uncoordinated but opposition stiffened as the assault progressed, leading to heavy losses among the battalions of the 5th Brigade. By 13 April, the division had been shifted eastward to guard the flanks of a British assault on Bremen, and the following day I Canadian Corps liberated Arnhem. On 2 May, the 2nd Division took Oldenburg, solidifying Canadian positions throughout the Netherlands. German and Canadian forces declared a ceasefire on 5 May, and all fighting came to an end with the surrender of German forces in Western Europe on 7 May 1945. In October 1945, after four months in the Netherlands, General Order 52/46 officially disbanded the headquarters of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. By December, the entirety of the division had been stood down and returned to Canada.

====Commanding Officers====
===Peacetime operations===
==== Operation ELEMENT ====

Operation ELEMENT represented the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) response to the influx of irregular immigrants crossing into Canada from the United States. The operation was supported through a whole-of-government approach.

Beginning at the end of July 2017, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were using considerable amounts of resources to manage the significant increase in irregular immigrants seeking asylum crossing the Canadian border from the United States. To aid civil authorities manage this situation, the CAF deployed approximately 370 troops to build and maintain temporary accommodations at two sites: one at Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, and one at the Nav Canada facility in Cornwall, Ontario.

The mission was called to an end by the Canadian government on 1 December 2017, and ended on 12 December 2017.

==== Operation LENTUS ====

Operation LENTUS is the ongoing Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) response to domestic natural disasters.
In the event that provincial and territorial authorities, the first responders to major natural disasters, are unable to deal with the resulting damage on their own, they may ask the CAF for help. LENTUS follows established action plans, adaptable to multiple situation, in order to provide support to populations in crisis. The objectives of the CAF during this type of operation is threefold: to provide aid to civil authorities, to respond to the call to action swiftly and efficiently, and to stabilize natural disaster conditions.

On 5 May 2017, severe flooding in the Province of Quebec led to the provincial government requesting aid from the CAF. From 6 May – 5 June 2017, the CAF provided support to Quebec&#x27;s flood relief efforts by mobilizing 2600 CAF members, 400 vehicles, six CH-146 &quot;Griffon&quot; helicopters, one CH-147 &quot;Chinook&quot; helicopter, one Halifax-class frigate (HMCS &quot;Montréal&quot;), and 15 small boats. The CAF operated in five affected regions during this period: Trois-Rivières, Montréal, Mauricie, Outaouais, and Montérégie.

==== Operation CADENCE ====

Operation CADENCE represents the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) support of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) security efforts for major domestic events, including key conferences like the 44th G7 summit.

During this summit from 8 to 9 June 2018 in Charlevoix, Que., the CAF provided planning and air support to the RCMP; conducted monitoring operations by air, land, and sea; and aided civil authorities in maintaining the security of controlled airspace. Over 2000 members, both Reserve and Regular Force, comprised the task force charged with these responsibilities.

Critics cited &quot;Flood&quot; as the band&#x27;s breakthrough song due to airplay on contemporary Christian music and alternative rock radio stations, two radio formats which rarely intersect. It was released in 1995 as their debut single and is from their self-titled debut album. &quot;Flood&quot; was a multi-format crossover hit in the United States, peaking at 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was also a hit in Canada, where it reached No. 3 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart. The song also saw heavy rotation on MTV during the mid-to-late-1990s.

<doc id="811290" wikidata="Q2816553" url="?curid=811290" title="3rd Canadian Division">
<text>The 3rd Canadian Division is a formation of the Canadian Army responsible for the command and mobilization of all army units in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, as well as Northwestern Ontario including the city of Thunder Bay.

It was first created as a formation of the Canadian Corps during the First World War. It was stood down following the war and was later reactivated as the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division during the Second World War. The second iteration served with distinction from 1941 to 1945, taking part in the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. A duplicate of the 3rd Canadian Division was formed in 1945 to serve on occupation duty in Germany and was disbanded the following year.

==History==

===First World War===

The 3rd Canadian Division was formed in France in December 1915 under the command of Major-General Malcolm Mercer. Its members served in France and Flanders until Armistice Day. While with the 3rd Division at Ypres, Mercer became the highest-ranking Canadian officer killed in action during the First World War. On the same day, Brigadier V. A. Williams, commanding the 8th Infantry Brigade, became the highest-ranking Canadian officer captured in the First World War, also at the Battle of Mount Sorrel. Mercer was replaced by Louis Lipsett, who commanded the division until September 1918, shortly before he too was killed in action on 14 October 1918, while commander of British 4th Division. Major-General Frederick Loomis closed out World War I as the commander.

=== Second World War ===

The formation of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was authorized during the Second World War on 17 May 1940. There was then a considerable delay until the brigade and divisional headquarters were formed on 5 September, and the first divisional commander was appointed on 26 October.

While the division&#x27;s components were forming, The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa was detached and transferred to Iceland as part of Z Force. The battalion spent the winter of 1940–41 there, then moved to the United Kingdom. The division&#x27;s 8th and 9th Canadian Infantry Brigades began embarking as early as 1 July 1941 and arrived in the United Kingdom at the end of that month. The 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade embarked in August and arrived at the beginning of September.

After its arrival, the division spent three uneventful years in garrison and training duties prior to the assault landing on Juno Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944, as part of the British Second Army, later joining the newly formed First Canadian Army.

Battle honours include Caen, Falaise, clearing the Channel ports, the Breskens pocket, and the final offensives of 1945. During the Battle of the Scheldt, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had the nickname of &quot;Water Rats&quot; bestowed upon them by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, in recognition of the poor conditions of terrain through which they fought, first in the Normandy landings, and then in the flooded Breskens Pocket.

==== Juno Beach, D Day ====


Juno Beach was wide and stretched on either side of Courseulles-sur-Mer. It lay between Sword and Gold beaches which were the responsibility of British Army forces.

The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, with the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade under command, landed in two brigade groups, the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Each brigade had three infantry battalions and an armoured regiment in support, two artillery field regiments, combat engineer companies and specialist units of the British 79th Armoured Division. The 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse) tanks supported the 7th Brigade landing on the left and the 6th Armoured Regiment (1st Hussars) tanks supported the landing on the right. The division had been assigned extra artillery and anti-tank units doubling its artillery component.

The 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade was kept in reserve and landed later that day and advanced through the lead brigades. The 27th Armoured Regiment (The Sherbrooke Fusiliers Regiment) provided tank support.

The initial assault was carried out by:
* North Shore Regiment on the left at St. Aubin (Nan Red beach)
* Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles in the centre at Bernières (Nan White beach)
* Regina Rifles at Courseulles (Nan Green beach)
* Royal Winnipeg Rifles on the western edge of Courseulles (Mike Red and Mike Green beaches)

Canadian air, land and sea forces suffered approximately 950 casualties on D-Day, the majority being soldiers of the 3rd Canadian Division, of 21,400 troops landed on Juno beach that day.

By noon, the entire division was ashore and leading elements had pushed several kilometres inland to seize bridges over the Seulles. By 6:00 pm, they had captured the town of Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer. A 1st Hussars armoured troop reached its objective along with men of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada before nightfall, when both units moved 15 km inland and crossed the Caen-Bayeux highway. However, this troop was forced to pull back because they had passed the supporting infantry. By the end of D-Day, the division had penetrated farther into France than any other Allied force, though counter-attacks by elements of two German armoured divisions prevented further major gains for four weeks.

None of the assault divisions, including 3rd Canadian Division, had managed to secure their D-Day objectives, which lay inland, although the Canadians came closer than any other Allied formation. Indeed, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of the 8th Brigade were the only Allied battalion to capture their D-Day objective.

By the end of the next day, the Canadian forces had linked up with the British forces that had landed at Sword Beach.

====Fighting in Normandy====
The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division served extensively in the Battle of Normandy as a component firstly of I British Corps and later under the command of II Canadian Corps. On D-Day+1, units of the division became the first among the Allies to secure their D-Day objectives. The villages of Authie and Carpiquet both saw heavy fighting between the Canadians and German defenders of the 12th SS Panzer Division. Over the course of five days, the 12th SS launched a series of counter-attacks in an attempt to crush the Canadian bridgehead and throw them back into the sea. The attacks cost the 12th a third of their armoured strength and they were forced to retire in the face of stubborn resistance, Allied naval gunfire and aerial superiority. On 4 July 1944, the 3rd Canadian Division, along with the British 3rd and 59th Infantry Divisions and supported by elements of the 79th Armoured Division launched Operation Windsor, capturing the Carpiquet Airfield and the surrounding areas from the 12th SS after several hours of confused and hard fighting. On 8 July, the 3rd Canadian Division participated in Operation Charnwood, the British Second Army&#x27;s final advance on the northern parts of Caen. Once again the Canadians excelled and captured all their objectives after suffering, once again, heavy casualties.

On 18 July, Operation Atlantic was launched, the Canadian advance that would coincide with Operation Goodwood, happening further east by British forces in the area south of Caen. The 2nd and 3rd Canadian divisions, supported by integral armour support, advanced towards Caen, one of the objectives being the village of Colombelles and the surrounding hills. This village and the surrounding area was defended by the battle-proven 21st Panzer Division. After several hours of confused fighting on the 18th and the 19th, the Germans were forced back from the outskirts of the town and pushed back over the river Orne. The 3rd Canadian Division continued the advance on the 20th and the lead units came under heavy machine-gun and small arms fire from a chateau close to Colombelles. The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, with support from the 17th Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars, pushed forward once again despite heavy casualties and captured the heavily fortified village of Gibberville. The rest of the 3rd Division captured Colombelles through the course of the day. The Canadians were then faced with the formidable German defensive positions on the Verrières Ridge, where the SS troops had created excellent field fortifications, deployed hundreds of field artillery pieces, including Nebelwerfers, and dug numerous trenches and foxholes for defence. The 2nd Canadian division&#x27;s 4th and 6th brigades assaulted the ridge, but suffered heavy losses and were forced to fall back. The attack went in during heavy rain, which turned the ground to mud and bogged down the Canadian armoured support and kept the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bomber support from the Royal Air Force from showing up. After the failed attack, troops from both the 2nd and 12th SS Panzer Division counter-attacked; it was only with support from the 3rd Canadian Division&#x27;s 8th Brigade that they managed to beat the Germans back.

Meanwhile, the British 3rd Infantry Division faced considerable resistance and advanced only with great cost of life. Tiger tanks from the &quot;schwere Panzerabteilung&quot; 503 (&quot;503rd Heavy Armour Battalion&quot;) caused ferocious losses among the British armour support. The 7th Armoured Division, 11th Armoured Division and Guards Armoured Division faced opposition from the 1st and 12th SS Panzer divisions and suffered heavy losses.

The offensive continued for two more days before the Allied offensive ground to a halt in face of stiffening German resistance. The German Panzer divisions in the area had been bled completely dry, losing a staggering number of tanks and men, which could not be easily replaced. Two days later, on 25 July, the United States First Army launched Operation Cobra, since there were no German panzer divisions to stop them as nearly all of the available panzer units had been sent to stop the British/Canadian advance. The 3rd Canadian Division and the other units involved in the offensive were allowed to catch their breath and they dug in, expecting a German counter-attack which never came.

On 5 September, 3rd Canadian overran the Fortress of Mimoyecques, revealing the infrastructure for the unknown V-3 cannon destroyed by the Tallboy bombs in July. Between 17 and 22 September 1944, 3rd Canadian were intimately involved in the liberation of Boulogne-sur-Mer, during which a French civilian guided the Canadians to a &quot;secret passage&quot; leading into the walled old town and by-passing the German defenders. By 1 October 1944, the Division had also liberated Calais.

====Commanders====
*Major-General Ernest William Sansom: 1940–1941
*Major-General Charles Basil Price: 1941–1942
*Major-General Rod Keller: 1942–1944
*Major-General Daniel Spry: 1944–1945
*Major-General Ralph Holley Keefler: 1945

===Duplicate division (Canadian Army Occupation Force) 1945–1946===
In 1945, the 3rd Canadian Division, Canadian Army Occupation Force (CAOF) was created, based on the organization of the 3rd Infantry Division. The component units of the new division were named after the units of the existing 3rd Infantry Division. The formation was formed on the organizational structure of a standard infantry division and supplied units as part of Canada&#x27;s commitment to postwar European reconstruction. The occupation force served in Germany until relieved by the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division of the British Army on 15 May 1946. Authorization for units to disband came under General Order 162/46 and 201/46, and headquarters was disbanded by General Order 283/46, effective 20 June 1946.

=== Recent history (1990–present) ===
In the early 1990s Land Force Western Area (LFWA) was established as one of four area commands of the Canadian Army. LFWA was responsible for all Regular and Reserve Army formations in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. The line formations of LFWA included 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, 38 Canadian Brigade Group, 39 Canadian Brigade Group, and 41 Canadian Brigade Group.

In addition to the brigades, LFWA was also composed of 1 Area Support Group and its bases, 4th Canadian Ranger Patrol Group of the Canadian Rangers, and the Western Area Training Centre. LFWA contributed extensively to domestic operations at home, and on missions abroad in locales such as the Balkans and Afghanistan for over two decades.

On 6 June 2014, on the 70th anniversary of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division&#x27;s D-Day landing in Normandy, LFWA became 3rd Canadian Division. On the same day, 3 Cdn Div was permanently bestowed the French Grey designation patch.

== Insignia ==
In August 1916, individual battalions of the Canadian Corps were ordered to wear a distinguishing patch to better provide command and control in battle. Battalions were represented by a series of coloured geometric patches that corresponded to their seniority within the brigades of the overseas divisions of the corps. These shapes were sewn over top of a rectangle wide by tall which was also colour coded by division, and worn on the upper rear of each soldier&#x27;s uniform jacket and greatcoat, just below the collar. The location was quickly moved from the collar to the sleeve. The 3rd Division was originally ordered to wear white patches, followed ten days later by an order changing the colour to black and the location. In May 1917, the commander of the 3rd Division published a routine order stating that, because the black patches were too difficult to see, French grey was to be worn instead.

The patch was revived in 1941. The 3rd Canadian Division, CAOF, wore a French-grey patch with a French-grey bar added horizontally underneath the division patch to distinguish it from the war service 3rd Division.

In 2014, the revived 3rd Canadian Division adopted a French-grey formation patch. After much debate, Pantone Grey 535C was adopted. The Pantone colour is actually &quot;Blue Range&quot; and was arrived at by comparison to artifacts in various historical exhibits. The colour was approved by the Directorate of History and Heritage, a sub-group of the Department of National Defence.

They were formerly attached by several skyways, but as of September 28, 2008 these were in the process of being removed. Some apartments and offices, and Huron Square, can also be accessed by the system, while not being officially part of it.

The center may be named after Sheldon Avenue, the street along which are the majority of its buildings or Ransom Sheldon, founder of Houghton.

Stores or businesses in Sheldon Center:
*Center Ice Skate and Sport
*Cyberia Cafe
*Suomi Home Bakery and Restaurant
*Wells Fargo Bank (main Houghton branch)

<text>Sudbury Hill is a London Underground station in Sudbury, north-west London. It is on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line between South Harrow and Sudbury Town stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4. The station is located on Greenford Road (A4127) north of the junction with Whitton Avenue, on the border between the London Boroughs of Harrow and Ealing. The station is close to Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station.

==History==
Sudbury Hill station was opened on 28 June 1903 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) on its new extension to South Harrow from Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey.

This new extension was, together with the existing tracks back to Acton Town, the first section of the Underground&#x27;s surface lines to be electrified and operate electric instead of steam trains. The deep-level tube lines open at that time (City &amp; South London Railway, Waterloo &amp; City Railway and Central London Railway) had been electrically powered from the start.

The original station building was demolished in 1930 and 1931 and replaced by a new station in preparation for the handover of the branch from the District line to the Piccadilly line. The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass. Like the stations at Sudbury Town and Alperton to the south as well as others that Holden designed elsewhere for the east and west Piccadilly line extensions such as Acton Town and Oakwood, Sudbury Hill station features a tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure that contains station facilities and shops. The brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.

On 4 July 1932 the Piccadilly line was extended to run west of its original terminus at Hammersmith sharing the route with the District line to Ealing Common. From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line.

The station was made a Grade II Listed Building on 17 May 1994.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube. This was achieved on 30 December 2021 with the installation of two lifts.

==Services==
The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)

<doc id="811304" wikidata="Q3477391" url="?curid=811304" title="4th Canadian Division">
<text>The 4th Canadian Division is a formation of the Canadian Army. The division was first created as a formation of the Canadian Corps during the First World War. During the Second World War the division was reactivated as the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in 1941 and then converted to armour and redesignated as the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Beginning in 1916 the division adopted a distinctive green-coloured formation patch as its insignia. In 2013 it was announced that Land Force Central Area would be redesignated 4th Canadian Division. It is currently responsible for Canadian Army operations in the Canadian province of Ontario and is headquartered at Denison Armoury in Toronto.

==History==
===First World War===
The 4th Canadian Division was formed in Britain in April 1916 from several existing units and others scheduled to arrive shortly thereafter. Under the command of Major-general David Watson, the Division embarked for France in August of that year where they served both in the Western Front in France and in Flanders until Armistice Day. The 4th Canadian Division was a part of the Canadian Corps in the Battle of Vimy Ridge, which attacked and defeated the Germans, driving them from the ridge. As a result, the Canadians became known as masters of offensive warfare and an elite fighting force.

In the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917, the 4th Canadian Division was given the job of capturing Hill 145, the highest and most important feature of Vimy Ridge. However, when they attempted to capture the hill, they were hampered by fire from the &quot;Pimple&quot;, which was the other prominent height at Vimy Ridge. To capture Hill 145, forces which were supposed to attack the Pimple were redeployed and captured Hill 145.

=== Second World War ===

==== 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division ====
The 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division was created during World War II by the conversion of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division at the beginning of 1942 in Canada. The division proceeded overseas in 1942, with its two main convoys reaching the United Kingdom in August and October.

The division spent almost two years training in the United Kingdom before crossing to Normandy in July 1944. In the United Kingdom, it participated in war games together with the Polish 1st Armoured Division, and later fought in France, the Low Countries, and Germany; both divisions followed very close paths. The division participated in the later stages of the Battle of Normandy at the Falaise Pocket, the advance from Normandy and spent almost two months engaged at the Breskens Pocket as well as Operation Pheasant. It wintered in the Netherlands and took part in the final advance across northern Germany.

===Commanding officers===
=== David Vivian Currie VC===
David Vivian Currie VC was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in command of a battle group of tanks from The South Alberta Regiment, artillery, and infantry of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada at St. Lambert-sur-Dives, during the final actions to close the Falaise Gap. This was the only Victoria Cross awarded to a Canadian soldier during the Normandy campaign (from 6 June 1944 to the end of August 1944), and the only VC ever awarded to a member of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.

The then 32-year-old Currie was a Major in The South Alberta Regiment. During the Battle of Falaise, Normandy, between 18–20 August 1944, Currie was in command of a small mixed force of tanks, self-propelled anti-tank guns and infantry which had been ordered to cut off one of the Germans&#x27; main escape routes.

After Currie led the attack on the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives and consolidated a position halfway inside it, he repulsed repeated enemy attacks over the next day and a half. Despite heavy casualties, Major Currie&#x27;s command destroyed seven enemy tanks, twelve 88 mm guns and 40 vehicles, which led to the deaths of 300 German soldiers, 500 wounded and 1,100 captured. The remnants of two German armies were denied an escape route.

==Land Force Central Area and 2013 reactivation==
The LFCA was created on 1 September 1991, taking command of what was previously Central Militia Area and the Regular Force Army units and formations in Ontario from the northern Lakehead region to the border with Quebec. At that point in time, the six subordinate militia districts were reorganized into four: Northern Ontario District, London District, Toronto District, and Ottawa District each one garrisoned by a brigade of militia troops and a small number of regular support staff. Later that decade, in 1997, the four reserve force districts were again reorganized into three brigade groups.

At the time of its creation in the early-1990s, it was housed on the grounds of the former base and subsequently moved ca 1993 to the Place Nouveau office tower at Yonge Street north of Finch Avenue; this was controversial as the offices of the area commander, Major-General Brian Vernon, were lavishly renovated, attracting political criticism and attention from the Auditor General of Canada.

In 2013, the LFCA was renamed the &quot;4th Canadian Division&quot;. With this change of name, the formation was also granted the identifying patch and historical lineage of the division that fought in the two world wars.

== Present day organization ==

The division is headquartered in Toronto and covers the province of Ontario.

<text>The 5th Canadian Division is a formation of the Canadian Army responsible for the command and mobilization of most army units in the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador; as well as some units in Kingston, Ontario. The division is recognized by the distinctive maroon patch worn on the sleeve of its soldiers.

It was first created as a formation of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War. It was stood down during the war only to be reactivated through the renaming from &#x27;1st Canadian Armoured Division&#x27; to the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division during the Second World War. It was stood down following demobilization and was again reactivated in 2013 with the renaming of the former Land Force Area Atlantic.

==First World War==
The 5th Canadian Division of the Canadian Corps was formed during World War I under Major-General Garnet Burk Hughes. The 5th began assembling in Britain in February, 1917, but was broken up in February 1918 before it was fully formed. The Division adopted a coloured formation patch identical in design to that worn by the four combatant divisions of the Canadian Corps. Its men were used as reinforcements for the other four Canadian divisions, helping to maintain the over-strength Divisions of 22,000–25,000 with more than 100,000 men total. It was reactivated in 2013.

==Second World War==

The 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division was a Canadian division during World War II. Following its redesignation from 1st Canadian Armoured Division, the bulk proceeded overseas in one main convoy, arriving in the United Kingdom at the end of November 1941.

The 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division spent two years of the war uneventfully in the United Kingdom, before finally transferring to the Mediterranean theatre in November 1943 to join the 1st Canadian Infantry Division as part of I Canadian Corps, under command of the British Eighth Army. The division moved without its tanks and vehicles, inheriting heavily used equipment as a legacy from the veteran British 7th Armoured Division (&quot;The Desert Rats&quot;) who they relieved on the Italian Front. The majority of the vehicles were completely worn out, having first been issued in North Africa or were two-wheel drive–useless in Italy. It took several months for the division to be fully equipped with new vehicles, including M4 Shermans. Only the 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade was committed prior to 31 January 1944.

The 5th Armoured took part in the Italian Campaign until the end of 1944, seeing notable action on the Hitler Line after the Allied breakthrough at Cassino in May 1944 and also during &quot;Operation Olive&quot; on the Gothic Line in August 1944. During the latter battle its single infantry brigade was augmented by a second, which was raised using reinforcements and units serving in other roles. Among them was the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards–1st Canadian Division&#x27;s armoured reconnaissance regiment. As with other Allied armoured divisions in the Mediterranean, local resources were used to establish an additional infantry brigade, the 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Based on the colour of its shoulder patch, the division became known as the &quot;Mighty Maroon Machine&quot;.

In January 1945, the division, together with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, as part of Operation Goldflake, moved by truck, train, and naval transport to Belgium via Livorno and Marseille. After arriving on the Western Front, it disbanded the 12th Brigade, and re-equipped to join the First Canadian Army in time to participate in the final advance into Germany.

In April 1945, the Irish Regiment of Canada was assigned to Operation Cleanser in the Netherlands. They had to liberate the route from Arnhem to Harderwijk. This unexpectedly resulted in a fierce fight at the Battle of Otterlo.

==Land Force Atlantic Area==
Land Force Atlantic Area (LFAA) was created on 1 September 1991, taking command of what was previously the militia areas and the Regular Force Army units and formations in Atlantic Canada. At that point in time, the Militia Areas ceased to exist, and the subordinate Militia Districts were reorganised. Later that decade, the reserve force districts were again reorganized into two Canadian Brigade Groups. LFAA was the formation responsible for Canadian Army operations in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island and was headquartered at Canadian Forces Base Halifax.

===Organization of LFAA (2010)===
Regular Force
* 2nd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment : Oromocto (transferred to command of 2 CMBG in 2012)
* 4 Air Defence Regiment, RCA : Oromocto, New Brunswick (Transformed into 4th Artillery Regiment (General Support), RCA in 2013)
* 4 Engineer Support Regiment : Oromocto
* 3 Military Police Unit : Halifax, Nova Scotia

* Canadian Forces Base Gagetown : Arcadia, New Brunswick

Reserve Force
* 36 Canadian Brigade Group
* 37 Canadian Brigade Group
* 5 Canadian Ranger Patrol Group: Gander, Newfoundland
* 3 Intelligence Company: Halifax, Nova Scotia

== 5th Canadian Division Re-Activation ==
In 2013, LFAA was re-designated the 5th Canadian Division and inherited the wartime heritage of the formation. The division continues to be headquartered at CFB Halifax and commands most Canadian Army units in the Atlantic provinces.

<text>Mangaldan, officially the Municipality of Mangaldan (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 113,185 people.

== Etymology ==
There are four conflicting origins of the name Mangaldan:
* The first theory suggests that a Spanish missionary asked locals for the name of the settlement. A local, misinterpreting the request as a query for water, responded with “manga-alay-adan,” which translates to “Adan is fetching.”
* The second theory implies that Mangaldan got its name from its first native chief Babaldan.
* The third theory posits that the town&#x27;s name originated from the term “man-nga-ngal-ngalan,” which means “quarrel” in the local dialect. This name emerged from a custom where townspeople were free to gather mangoes from a large tree in the town center, leading to disputes as the fruit became scarce.
* According to Fr. Raymundo Suarez, OP, in his manuscript &quot;Apuntes Curiosos de Pangasinan&quot;, Mangaldan is derived from &quot;alar&quot; or &quot;alad&quot;, meaning bamboo fence, which existed in the place. Either term is combined with &quot;mang&quot; and &quot;an,&quot; and the penultimate &quot;A&quot; is dropped, resulting in &quot;Mangaldan.&quot;

== History ==
Mangaldan owns the distinction as the third town in Pangasinan to be founded by the Dominican missionaries. As early as 1591, Mangaldan already existed as a Spanish encomienda. Its foundation as a town is attributed to Juan Martinez de Santo Domingo, a former missionary of Pangasinan who died in Japan on March 19, 1618.

Mangaldan started as a &quot;visita&quot; of Calasiao and it remained as such until the Dominicans created it as an independent vicariate under the patronage of Saint Thomas Aquinas on June 2, 1600.

It is said that of all the people of Pangasinan, the Mangaldanians were the most difficult to convert. The greatest enemy of the missionaries in the town was a certain man named Casipit who tried to force them out of the town and even attempted to kill some of them. Yet, when he was converted by the first apostle, Fr. Pedro Soto, he became the principal propagator of the Faith. He contributed a great sum of money for the construction of the first church.

In the second half of the 19th century, Mangaldan was the richest town in the province. This was due to the famous irrigation system which the missionaries built within the confines of the town causing its fertile fields to yield bountiful harvest of palay. Most outstanding in this gigantic task was Fr. Jose Torres who gave his life to bring it to completion in 1892.

The third church to be built in Mangaldan was completed in 1812 by Fr. Lorenzo Martin. It collapsed during the great earthquake of 16 March 1892, together with the big chapel in the cemetery. The construction of the convent dates back in 1747. The construction of the sixth and present church of Mangaldan was begun in 1942 by Fr. Juan Sison, and was completed 20 years later by Fr. Leon Bitanga.

During World War II, Mangaldan had an airstrip that was used by the American military.

==Economy==

Mangaldan celebrates its annual &quot;Pindang Festival&quot;, along with its town fiesta, during the first week of March. The popular &quot;carabeef tapa&quot; (Filipino-style dried meat), locally known as &quot;Pindang&quot; is the One Town One Product (OTOP) of this municipality. The municipality is also the home of the original makers of the famous delicacy – the Romana Peanut Brittle.

The town won the grand slam award when its inland body of water, the Angalacan River, was adjudged as the cleanest river in the entire province for the third time which was awarded in 2012.

One of the major sources of revenues here are the thriving market place and the laboratories of renowned pharmaceutical companies that buttressed the coffer of this town. The municipal government operates its slaughterhouse with a rated &quot;double A&quot; by the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) that guarantees the butchered meat as safe and clean.

In 2015, the annual budget of Mangaldan involved a total appropriation of , which was the biggest for a first-class municipality in Pangasinan.

<text>&quot;Averroës&#x27;s Search&quot; (original Spanish title: &quot;La Busca de Averroes&quot;) is a 1947 short story by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. Originally published in the magazine &quot;Sur&quot;, it was later included in his second anthology of short stories, &quot;El Aleph&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The story imagines the difficulty of Averroës, the famed Islamic philosopher and translator, in translating Aristotle&#x27;s Poetics because he was not able to understand what a play was, owing to the absence of live theatrical performances from Averroës&#x27; cultural milieu, in contrast to that of ancient Greece. In the story, Averroës casually observes some children play-acting, then later hears a traveler ineptly describe an actual theatrical performance he once saw in a distant land, but still fails to understand that the tragedies and comedies of which Aristotle writes are a kind of performance art, rather than merely literature.

The process of writing the story is meant to parallel the events in the story itself; Borges writes in an afterword to the story that his attempt to understand Averroës was as doomed as Averroës&#x27;s attempt to understand drama. &quot;I felt that the work mocked me, foiled me, thwarted me. I felt that Averroës, trying to imagine what a play is without ever having suspected what a theater is, was no more absurd than I, trying to imagine Averroës yet with no more material than a few snatches from Renan, Lane, and Asín Palacios.&quot;

<doc id="811333" wikidata="Q1488320" url="?curid=811333" title="Alperton tube station">
<text>Alperton is a London Underground station in Alperton, north-west London. It is on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line between Sudbury Town and Park Royal stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 4. It is located on Ealing Road (A4089), a short distance from the junction with Bridgewater Road (A4005), and is close to the Paddington branch of the Grand Union Canal.

==History==
Alperton was opened on 28 June 1903 by the District Railway (now the District line), with its name being &quot;Perivale Alperton&quot;, on its new extension to South Harrow on electrified tracks from Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey, which it was opened five days earlier. This new extension was, together with the existing tracks back to Acton Town, the first section of the Underground&#x27;s surface lines to be electrified and operate electric traction instead of steam. The deep-level tube lines open at that time (City &amp; South London Railway, Waterloo &amp; City Railway and Central London Railway) had been electrically powered from the start.

The station was subsequently renamed &quot;Alperton&quot; on 7 October 1910.

On 4 July 1932, from Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line service was replaced by the Piccadilly line. Piccadilly line services were extended to run west of its original terminus at Hammersmith, sharing the route with the District. It non-stops stations between Hammersmith and Acton Town, apart from Turnham Green, which the Piccadilly only calls during early mornings and late evenings. At Acton Town, the District and Piccadilly lines use separate platforms. They join back west of Acton Town towards Ealing Common.

The station was refurbished in 2006.
===Incidents and accidents===
On 2 March 1944 during the Second World War, bomb damage prevented through services to and from Uxbridge for five days.

==Design==
The original station building was a modest timber-framed structure built in 1910. In 1930 and 1931, this was demolished and replaced by a new station in preparation for the handover of the branch from the District line to the Piccadilly line. The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass. Like other stations such as Sudbury Town and Sudbury Hill to the north and others that Holden designed elsewhere, and also for the east and west Piccadilly line extensions such as Acton Town and Oakwood, Alperton station features a tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure that contains station offices and shops. The brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.

Alperton formerly shared with Greenford (on the Central line) the distinction of being one of the only two stations to have an escalator going up to the platforms. In 1955, an up escalator was installed to the eastbound platform. It had originally been used at the South Bank exhibition of the Festival of Britain. The escalator fell out of use in 1988, and its machine remains in place behind a wall.

==Services and connections==
===Services===
Alperton station is on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line between Sudbury Town to the west and Park Royal to the east.

The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)
*3tph to Rayners Lane (Westbound)
*3tph to Uxbridge via Rayners Lane (Westbound)

The peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*12tph to Cockfosters (Eastbound)
*6tph to Rayners Lane (Westbound)
*6tph to Uxbridge via Rayners Lane (Westbound)

During disruption on the District line, Piccadilly line trains have sometimes been used to provide a service to Ealing Broadway, either by diverting some trains bound for Rayners Lane and Uxbridge, or as a shuttle from Acton Town. Trains may also run along the District Line tracks from Hammersmith to Acton Town in order to serve those stations with no platforms on the Piccadilly Line.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 79, 83, 224, 245, 297, 483, 487 and night route N83 serve the station, with route 297 providing a 24-hour service.

<doc id="811335" wikidata="Q17674926" url="?curid=811335" title="Combe Hill, East Sussex">
<text>Combe Hill is a causewayed enclosure, near Eastbourne in East Sussex, on the northern edge of the South Downs. It consists of an inner circuit of ditches and banks, incomplete where it meets a steep slope on its north side, and the remains of an outer circuit. Causewayed enclosures were built in England from shortly before 3700 BC until at least 3500 BC; they are characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways. Their purpose is not known; they may have been settlements, meeting places, or ritual sites. The historian Hadrian Allcroft included the site in his 1908 book &quot;Earthwork of England&quot;, and in 1930 E. Cecil Curwen listed it as a possible Neolithic site in a paper which attempted to provide the first list of all the causewayed enclosures in England.

The enclosure has been excavated twice: in 1949, by Reginald Musson, and in 1962, by Veronica Seton-Williams, who used it as a training opportunity for volunteers. Charcoal fragments from Musson&#x27;s dig were later dated to between 3500 and 3300 BC. Musson also found a large quantity of Ebbsfleet ware pottery in one of the ditches. Seton-Williams found three polished stone axes deposited in another ditch, perhaps not long after it had been dug. The site is only from Butts Brow, another Neolithic enclosure, and the two locations are visible from each other; both sites may have seen Neolithic activity at the same time.

== Background ==

Combe Hill is a causewayed enclosure, a form of earthwork that was built in northwestern Europe, including the southern British Isles, in the early Neolithic period. Causewayed enclosures are areas that are fully or partially enclosed by ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground, often with earthworks and palisades in some combination. The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate. The causeways are difficult to explain in military terms since they would have provided multiple ways for attackers to pass through the ditches to the inside of the camp, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force. Evidence of attacks on some sites support the idea that the enclosures were built as fortified settlements. They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery. There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains was deliberately deposited in the ditches. The construction of these enclosures took only a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.

Over 70 causewayed enclosures have been identified in the British Isles, and they are one of the most common types of early Neolithic site in western Europe. About a thousand are known in all. They began to appear at different times in different parts of Europe: dates range from before 4000 BC in northern France, to shortly before 3000 BC in northern Germany, Denmark, and Poland. The enclosures in southern Britain began to appear shortly before 3700 BC, and continued to be built for at least 200 years; in a few cases, they continued to be used as late as 3300 to 3200 BC.

== Site ==

Combe Hill is on the South Downs, overlooking the Weald to the north, about northwest of Eastbourne, in East Sussex. An inner circuit of ditch and bank is almost complete, except for where it meets a steep downslope on the north side. The remains of an outer circuit of ditch and bank are visible to the west and east, enclosing an area of about , with the inner circuit covering . A round barrow lies about to the west, and two more are within to the east, along the same hilltop; one is possibly of Anglo-Saxon origin. The enclosure is crossed by a footpath, from Jevington northeastwards to Willingdon. Two of the causeways, at the south and east, are wider than the others, and may have originally been entranceways.

Only one radiocarbon date has been obtained from the site; it was taken from charcoal from the ditch at the south end of trench 1 in the plan at right, and indicates the site was constructed no later than the second half of the fourth millennium BC. The secondary (outer) circuit may indicate two stages of use, but the two excavations found little deposited material, and it may be that the site did not see extensive use. The great majority of pottery finds came from the western side, and are associated with animal bone and charcoal fragments; Peter Drewett, who reviewed the excavation history in 1994, suggested that three polished axes deposited at the eastern side of the enclosure were there to mark a boundary, for example if the enclosure represented the eastern extent of the territorial control of the people who built it.

A 2001 review of the areas enclosed by causewayed sites found three distinct groupings of sizes, the smallest group ranging from , and the median at about . Many of these smaller enclosures are in the upper Thames Valley, near rivers, and of the others, those at higher elevations like Combe Hill, often have a second causewayed ditch surrounding the first. Most causewayed enclosures are fairly close to circular in layout, but the inner enclosure at Combe Hill is somewhat elliptical, the long axis running east–west. The outer circuit is not as well-preserved as the inner circuit, but this may be because parts of it were levelled, perhaps during the Neolithic.

Causewayed enclosures can be broadly grouped by the physical landscapes in which they lie. Combe Hill is one of a group that lie on high ground, and like many of this type, the enclosure is placed so that it is visible from the high ground near the site, but not from the lower ground from which the hill is most clearly visible. Combe Hill&#x27;s enclosure slopes slightly away from the steep north slope, so that none of the earthworks can be seen from the north—instead, it is visible from the massif of the South Downs, to its south. However, given that Combe Hill was probably constructed when trees covered the area, the cleared area would have been visible from the north as a treeless notch, above the steep slope.

A Neolithic enclosure (probably causewayed) at Butts Brow, about to the south of Combe Hill, was identified in 2016. The two sites are visible from each other, and dating evidence from pottery at Butts Brow makes it plausible that there was activity at both sites at the same time.

Combe Hill was listed as a scheduled monument in 1981.

== Archaeological investigations ==
The historian Hadrian Allcroft included the site in his 1908 survey, &quot;Earthwork of England&quot;; he describes it as of &quot;almost beyond doubt of British construction&quot;, meaning that it precedes the Roman conquest. The plan he drew shows no gaps in the ditches and banks around the site, reflecting his belief (common among archaeologists at that time) that the gaps were either damage to the original structure or meant that the enclosure was unfinished, and that a plan should show the layout without gaps. The causeways separating the ditches and the associated gaps in the banks were first noticed by Veronica Keiller, the wife of the archaeologist Alexander Keiller. E. Cecil Curwen surveyed the site with a boser—a heavy rammer used for detecting underground bedrock, or the lack of it, by listening to the sound made when the boser strikes the ground—and published a plan of the site in 1929. Curwen also listed it as a possible Neolithic site in his 1930 paper &quot;Neolithic Camps&quot;, which was the first attempt to assemble a list of all the causewayed enclosures in England.

Only one of the three barrows nearby has been investigated: Leslie Grinsell reported in 1934 that one had been opened by Major F. Maitland, in 1907, and in 1941, Curwen&#x27;s father, Eliot Curwen, published a short note describing the finds, which had been donated to the Sussex Archaeological Society&#x27;s museum by A.F. Maitland, the Major&#x27;s son. The finds consisted of four bronze axes in excellent condition: one complete, two that had been deliberately broken in half, probably as votive offerings, and the blade from a fourth. The axes were found under a large stone, &quot;estimated to have been about 3 cwt. in weight&quot; (about 335 lbs), in the barrow to the west of the enclosure.

G. P. Burstow visited the hill in August 1945, and found Romano-British pottery and half-a-dozen Roman coins exposed at two or three places near the top of the hill, in some cases in tracks worn by army vehicles; an additional Roman coin was found in 1947. All were donated to the Sussex Archaeological Society&#x27;s museum. The coins dated from the mid 3rd century to the early fourth century AD. In 1980, a metal detectorist found a hoard of 144 Roman coins on the north slope of Combe Hill. The latest coins in the hoard come from the reigns of Tetricus I and Tetricus II, so the hoard appears to have been buried towards the end of the third century AD.

=== Musson, 1949 ===
In 1949 Reginald Musson excavated Combe Hill for the Eastbourne Natural History and Archaeological Society, to determine the accuracy of Curwen&#x27;s plan. He began by opening the north end of a ditch on the west side (at the south end of trench 1 in the diagram). This trench was extended northwards, finding first a long causeway of unexcavated chalk, and then the southern end of the next ditch in the circuit. The ditch at the south end of trench 1 was about deep and yielded 912 sherds of Neolithic pottery and plentiful flint flakes; the one at the north end was only a foot deep and contained flints, but no pottery except a few fragments of early Iron Age and Romano-British pottery, just below the turf line. The causeway was cleared down to the chalk but there were no post-holes. Musson also investigated the bank of earth next to the ditch (trench 2 in the diagram), clearing an area to search for post-holes, but none were found.

The pottery found in the southern ditch was all identified as Ebbsfleet ware. It was not deposited at the bottom of the ditch; Musson&#x27;s report shows a layer of silting below the layer containing pottery and flints, and Peter Drewett, an archaeologist who summarized Musson&#x27;s work in a later review of the site, describes the pottery as a &quot;dump&quot;, on top of a layer of &quot;clean chalk rubble&quot; a foot thick. Only five animal bones were found, four of ox and one from a pig. Charcoal fragments of ash, hawthorn and hazel were found; there was no oak, which was unusual, and in his later review Drewett suggested this might indicate the landscape had been cleared. Drewett arranged for some of the charcoal found by Musson to be radiocarbon dated, and the result was a date range of 3500 to 3300 BC. The enclosure was probably constructed before this range, which matches the dates known for the pottery Musson found.

A pair of tabular flints, which Musson identified as a hearth, were found in the ditch, associated with some of the bones and charcoal. A later review, as part of the Gathering Time project to date Neolithic enclosures, suggested that the lack of signs of burning cast doubt on this identification, and also commented that the steep sides of the ditch shown in Musson&#x27;s section diagram might indicate that the ditch had been recut there. Musson&#x27;s flint finds included a leaf-shaped arrowhead, though this had been lost by the time Drewett conducted his review. The snail shells found at different levels below the surface were analyzed in Musson&#x27;s report, but no conclusions were drawn at the time. A subsequent re-analysis, based on extracting more snail shells from soil samples preserved from Musson&#x27;s dig, was undertaken by K. D. Thomas, an expert on molluscs, for Drewett&#x27;s 1994 review. Thomas concluded that the enclosure had been constructed in woodland that was still standing or had only recently been cleared.

=== Seton-Williams, 1962 ===
Veronica Seton-Williams spent two weeks, from 1 to 15 July 1962, excavating the site as a training exercise for a group of about twenty. She did not publish her work, but her notes and some of the finds survive, and were used by Peter Drewett in a 1994 review of the site. A total of 21 trenches were dug; Drewett comments that the reasons for the positioning of some of the trenches are unclear, and &quot;may be explained partly by the fact that the project was run as a training excavation&quot;.

Trench A was dug across both the inner ditch and associated bank, revealing no evidence that the bank, which contained the material excavated from the ditch, had been reinforced. Trench B crossed the outer ditch and bank; a few sherds of Romano-British pottery were found in the upper layers of the trench, but nothing from within the ditch. Once the ditch had silted in, another shallow cut had been made, which Drewett dates to the Romano-British period, based on the pottery found in the layers inside the recut. In both cases the ditch appears to have silted in quickly. A set of six grid squares and a rectangular area (marked C on the diagram) were excavated over one of the causeways, finding 278 pieces of struck flint, all from the turf and topsoil layer; Drewett suggests that the causeway may have been an area where flint cores were prepared.

Trench D was in the middle of the enclosure, and revealed no finds. A series of 7 trenches, labelled E1 through E7, were cut through the ditch and bank just south of the causeway where the C trenches were dug. As with the ditch to the north it appeared that the ditch had filled with natural silt rather than having been deliberately filled in, and Drewett estimated that the lowest levels of silting might have formed within a year or two of the ditch being dug. On top of these silt layers, three polished flint axes were found deposited next to each other in trench E6. Near the top of these trenches, Beaker pottery was found. Two small trenches, labelled F1 and F2 on the diagram, were dug at the top of the slope, but found no evidence that the bank and ditch had ever extended around the enclosure&#x27;s northern side. Trench G produced a few sherds and some struck flint; these were all lost by the time Drewett evaluated the results of the dig, but he suggested that the pottery was probably Romano-British, since it was found not far below the turf line.

=== Later investigations ===

In May 1983, Rodney Castleden, a Sussex resident walking on Combe Hill, found a carved chalk item partly exposed through the turf in the middle of the enclosure. The object was examined by Alan Thompson, who was researching prehistoric carved chalk finds from Sussex. Thompson suggested it may have been a half-completed carving of a phallic symbol: it was roughly rectangular in cross-section, narrowing towards one end, with incised lines on two sides. Thompson could not determine what tool had been used to carve the chalk, or the age of the item, though he cites another phallic-shaped chalk find from Itford Hill in Sussex which was considered to be from the Bronze Age. In Drewett&#x27;s 1994 review he commented that since the item had not been found in the 1962 dig, which had dug a trench (labelled D on the site plan) at the spot where the item was found, it might have been carved in 1962 and left at the site.

The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England included Combe Hill in a 1995 survey of multiple sites. The resulting report, by Alastair Oswald, concluded that Thomas&#x27;s conclusions from snail shell evidence from Musson&#x27;s excavation were consistent with most of the Neolithic enclosures in Sussex: the evidence available for all but two of the other sites indicates they were probably constructed in small clearings in woodland. The two exceptions are The Trundle and Whitehawk Camp, both thought to have been constructed at a time when the woodland had already been cleared. In 2003, Brighton &amp; Hove Archaeological Society commissioned a resistivity survey of the site. The survey was hampered by dry weather, limiting the quality of the data, but the inner circuit and the western arc of the outer circuit were both detected. Clusters of post-holes were found in the south and east of the inner enclosure, which may have been part of a structure intended to control access to the entrances to the site.

Gathering Time was a project funded by English Heritage and the Arts and Humanities Research Council to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using Bayesian analysis. The authors, Alasdair Whittle, Frances Healy, and Alex Bayliss, published the results in 2011. Combe Hill was included in the project, but although a few animal bones and some charcoal had been retained from the excavations, no suitable material could be found for sampling.

<text>Yvette Guilbert (; born Emma Laure Esther Guilbert, 20 January 1865 – 3 February 1944) was a French cabaret singer and actress of the Belle Époque.

==Biography==
Emma Laure Esther Guilbert was born in Paris on 20 January 1865 to a modestly wealthy family. Her mother, Adeline, had a millinery business and her father was a shopkeeper. However, her father left when her mother&#x27;s business failed, leaving her in very difficult financial circumstances. She began singing as a child, but at age 16 worked as a model at the Printemps department store in Paris. She was discovered by a journalist. She took acting and diction lessons, which enabled her in 1886 to appear on stage at several smaller venues. Guilbert debuted at the Varieté Theatre in 1888. She eventually sang at the popular Eldorado club, then at the Jardin de Paris before headlining in Montmartre at the Moulin Rouge in 1890. The English painter William Rothenstein described this performance in his first volume of memoirs:

One evening Lautrec came up to the rue Ravignan to tell us about a new singer, a friend of Xanrof, who was to appear at the Moulin Rouge for the first time... We went; a young girl appeared, of virginal aspect, slender, pale, without rouge. Her songs were not virginal – on the contrary; but the frequenters of the Moulin were not easily frightened; they stared bewildered at this novel association of innocence with Xanrof&#x27;s horrific double entendre; stared, stayed and broke into delighted applause.

For her act, she was usually dressed in bright yellow with long gloves and stood almost perfectly still, gesturing with her long arms as she sang. An innovator, she favored monologue-like &quot;patter songs&quot; (as they came to be called) and often was billed as a &quot;diseuse&quot; or &quot;sayer&quot;. The lyrics (some of them her own) were raunchy; their subjects were tragedy, lost love, and the Parisian poverty from which she had come. During the 1890s she appeared regularly alongside Kam-Hill, another star of the time, often singing songs by Tarride. 

In 1892, she made her debut in the Café des Ambassadeurs at the Champs-Élysées. She changed the atmosphere at the cafe-concert overnight. Before her, the audience was noisy; the artists often heckled and bullied. With Guilbert, singers were finally able to perform in peace. For eight years, every summer, she returned to &quot;Les Ambassadeurs&quot;. In 1893, she urged the director Pierre Ducarre to put a roof over the garden, not only to improve acoustics, but also so that the venue could remain open even on rainy days.

Taking her cue from the new cabaret performances, Guilbert broke and rewrote all the rules of music-hall with her audacious lyrics, and the audiences loved her. She was noted in France, England, and the United States at the beginning of the 20th century for her songs and imitations of the common people of France. Author Patrick Bade believed that Guilbert &quot;derived her trademark black gloves from &quot;Pornocrates&quot;&quot; a famous painting by symbolist artist Félicien Rops.

She was a favorite subject of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who made many portraits and caricatures of Guilbert and dedicated his second album of sketches to her. Sigmund Freud attended her performances, including one in Vienna, and called her a favorite singer. George Bernard Shaw wrote a review highlighting her novelty.
The reviews were not all positive. The playwright and songwriter Maurice Lefèvre said of her
In 1897, she married Max Schiller, an impresario. Guilbert made successful tours of England and Germany, and the United States in 1895–1896. She performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Even in her fifties, her name still had drawing power and she appeared in several silent films (including a star turn in F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;). She also appeared in sound fims, including a role with friend Sacha Guitry. Her recordings for La Voix de son maître include the famous &quot;Le Fiacre&quot; as well as some of her own compositions such as &quot;Madame Arthur&quot;. She accompanied herself on piano for some numbers.

She once gave a performance for the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, at a private party on the French Riviera. Hostesses vied to have her at their parties.

In later years, Guilbert turned to writing about the Belle Époque, and in 1902, two of her novels (&quot;La Vedette&quot; and &quot;Les Demi-vieilles&quot;) were published. In the 1920s, there appeared her instructional book &quot;L&#x27;art de chanter une chanson&quot; (The art of singing a Song). She also conducted schools for young girls in New York and Paris. One of her pupils in Paris was the American soprano and folk song fieldworker Loraine Wyman. Another was Pamela Gibson, who became a senior archivist at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. 

Guilbert became a respected authority on her country&#x27;s medieval folklore and on 9 July 1932 was awarded the Legion of Honor as &quot;the Ambassadress of French Song&quot;.

Yvette Guilbert died in on 4 February 1944, aged 79, in Aix-en-Provence. She was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Twenty years later her biography &quot;That Was Yvette: The Biography of a Great Diseuse&quot; by Bettina Knapp and Myra Chipman (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1964) was released.

<text>The William Herschel Telescope (WHT) is a optical and near-infrared reflecting telescope located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, Spain. The telescope, which is named after William Herschel, the discoverer of the planet Uranus, is part of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes. It is funded by research councils from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Spain.

At the time of construction in 1987, the WHT was the third largest single optical telescope in the world. It is currently the second largest in Europe, and was the last telescope constructed by Grubb Parsons in their 150-year history.

The WHT is equipped with a wide range of instruments operating over the optical and near-infrared regimes. These are used by professional astronomers to conduct a wide range of astronomical research. Astronomers using the telescope discovered the first evidence for a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of the Milky Way, and made the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst. The telescope has 75% clear nights, with a median seeing of 0.7&quot;.

==History==
The WHT was first conceived in the late 1960s, when the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) was being designed. The British astronomical community saw the need for telescopes of comparable power in the northern hemisphere. In particular, there was a need for optical follow-up of interesting sources in the radio surveys being conducted at the Jodrell Bank and Mullard observatories (both located in the UK), which could not be done from the southern hemisphere location of the AAT.

The AAT was completed in 1974, at which point the British Science and Engineering Research Council began planning for a group of three telescopes located in the northern hemisphere (now known as the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes, ING). The telescopes were to be a (which became the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope), the Isaac Newton Telescope which was to be moved from its existing site at Herstmonceux Castle, and a 4m class telescope, initially planned as a . A new site was chosen at an altitude of on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, which is now the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory. The project was led by the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), who also operated the telescopes until control passed to an independent ING when the RGO closed in 1998.

By 1979 the 4 m was on the verge of being scrapped due to a ballooning budget, whilst the aperture had been reduced to . A panel known as the Tiger Team was convened to reduce the cost; a re-design cut the price-tag by 45%. Savings were primarily made by reducing the focal length of the telescope – which allowed the use of a smaller dome – and relocating non-essential functions outside the dome to a simpler (and thus cheaper) rectangular annexe. In the same year, the Isaac Newton Telescope was moved to Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, becoming the first of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes. In 1981 the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, NWO) bought a 20% stake in the project, allowing the WHT to be given the go-ahead. That year was the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Uranus by William Herschel, so it was decided to name the telescope in his honour.

Construction of the telescope was by Grubb Parsons, the last telescope that company produced in its 150-year history. Work began at their factory in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1983, and the telescope was shipped to La Palma in 1985 (the two other telescopes of the Isaac Newton Group began operating in 1984). The WHT saw first light on 1 June 1987; it was the third largest optical telescope in the world at the time. The total cost of the telescope, including the dome and the full initial suite of instruments, was £15M (in 1984, equivalent to £M in ); within budget once inflation is taken into account.

==Design==
===Optics===
The telescope consists of a f/2.5 primary mirror made by Owens-Illinois from Cervit, a zero-expansion glass-ceramic material, and ground by Grubb Parsons. The mirror blank was produced in 1969 as one of a set of four, along with those for the AAT, CFHT and Blanco telescopes, and was purchased for the WHT in 1979, ten years after it was made. The primary is solid and un-thinned, so no active optics system is required, despite its weight of . The mirror support cell holds the main mirror on a set of 60 pneumatic cylinders. Even under the most extreme loading (with the telescope pointing at the horizon, so the mirror is vertical) the shape of the mirror changes by only ; during normal operation the deformation is much smaller.

In its most usual configuration, a hyperbolic secondary mirror made of Zerodur is used to form a Ritchey Chretien f/11 Cassegrain system with a 15 arcmin field of view. An additional flat fold mirror allows the use of any one of two Nasmyth platforms or two folded Cassegrain stations, each with 5 arcmin fields of view. The telescope sometimes operates in a wide-field prime focus configuration, in which case the secondary is removed and a three element field-correcting lens inserted, which provides an effective f/2.8 focus with a 60 arcmin field of view (40 arcmin unvignetted). Changing between the Cassegrain and Nasmyth foci takes a matter of seconds and may be done during the night; switching to and from prime focus requires replacing the secondary mirror with a prime focus assembly during daytime (the two are mounted back-to-back) which takes around 30 minutes.

A Coudé focus was planned as a later addition, to feed an optical interferometer with another telescope, but this was never built. A chopping f/35 secondary mirror was planned for infrared observations, but was placed on hold by the cost-saving re-design and never implemented.

===Mount===
The optical system weighs and is manoeuvred on an alt-azimuth mount, with a total moving mass of (plus instruments). The BTA-6 and Multi Mirror Telescope had demonstrated during the 1970s the significant weight (and therefore cost) savings which could be achieved by the alt-azimuth design compared to the traditional equatorial mount for large telescopes. However, the alt-azimuth design requires continuous computer control, compensation for field rotation at each focus, and results in a 0.2 degree radius blind spot at the zenith where the drive motors cannot keep up with sidereal motion (the drives have a maximum speed of one degree per second in each axis). The mount is so smooth and finely balanced that before the drive motors were installed it was possible to move the then assembly by hand. During closed loop guiding, the mount is capable of an absolute pointing accuracy of 0.03 arcseconds.

===Dome===

The telescope is housed in an onion-shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of , manufactured by Brittain Steel. The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the centre of rotation is above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing. A conventional up-down 6m-wide shutter with wind-blind, several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control, and a capacity crane (used for moving the primary mirror e.g. for aluminising) are all incorporated. The size and shape of the shutter allow observations down to 12° above the horizon, which corresponds to an airmass of 4.8. The total moving mass of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.

Attached to the dome is a three-storey rectangular building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, which means the environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel large enough to accommodate the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).

==Operations==
The WHT is operated by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING), together with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope and 1.0m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope. Offices and administration are located an hour&#x27;s drive away in Santa Cruz de La Palma, the island&#x27;s capital. Funding is provided by the UK&#x27;s Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC, 65%), the Netherlands&#x27; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO, 25%) and Spain&#x27;s Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC, 10%) (2008 values). Telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding, although Spain receives an additional 20% allocation in return for use of the observatory site. Five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities. As a competitive research telescope, the WHT is heavily oversubscribed, typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available.

The vast majority of observations are carried out in visitor mode i.e. with the investigating astronomer physically present at the telescope. A shift to service mode operations (those carried out by observatory staff on behalf of astronomers who do not travel to the telescope) has been considered and rejected on scientific and operational grounds.

==Instruments==
The WHT is equipped with a wide range of scientific instruments, providing a range of capabilities to astronomers. , the common-user instrumentation is:

;ACAM
:Auxiliary-port CAMera – optical imager/spectrograph, with broad- and narrow-band imaging over an 8&#x27; field and low-resolution (R &lt; 900) spectroscopy. Permanently mounted at one of the broken-Cassegrain foci.

;ISIS
:Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System – medium resolution (R = 1,800-20,000) long-slit dual-beam optical spectrograph. Mounted at Cassegrain focus. ISIS was one of the original first generation of WHT instruments.

;LIRIS
:Long-slit Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph – near-infrared imager/spectrograph, with imaging over a 4&#x27; field, spectral resolutions R = 700–2500, spectropolarimetry, and long slit and multi-object slit-masks. Mounted at Cassegrain focus.

;WEAVE
:WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer - a multi-object optical spectrograph, which uses a robot positioner and optical fibres to observe up to 1000 targets at a time.

Beginning in 2022, 70% of the telescope&#x27;s time will be dedicated to surveys with WEAVE. Prior to the installation of WEAVE (2020-22), ISIS and LIRIS were the workhorses of the WHT, with approximately two-thirds of all time awarded using those two instruments.

In addition the WHT is a popular telescope for single-purpose visitor instruments, which in recent years have included PAUCam, GHαFaS, PNS, INTEGRAL, PLANETPOL, SAURON, FASTCAM and ULTRACAM. Visitor instruments can use either the Cassegrain focus or one of the Nasmyth foci.

A common set of calibration lamps (Helium and Neon arc lamps, and a Tungsten flat-field lamp) are permanently mounted at one of the broken-Cassegrain foci, and can be used for any of the other instruments.

==Scientific research==
Astronomers use the WHT to conduct scientific research across most branches of observational astronomy, including Solar System science, galactic astronomy, extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. Most of the instruments are designed to be useful for a range of different research.

The WHT has been used to make many significant new discoveries. Some of the more notable include the first evidence of a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of the Milky Way (in 1995) and the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 970228) (in 1997).

Since the mid-1990s the WHT has faced increasing competition from newer telescopes. Nevertheless, a wide range of research continues to be done with the telescope. In recent years () this has included:

* The SAURON project, an integral field spectrograph survey of nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies (2001–2010)
* The first spectrum of an asteroid which subsequently hit Earth, (2009)
* The first spectrum of Hanny&#x27;s Voorwerp (2009)
* The discovery that diffuse interstellar bands do not originate in circumstellar envelopes (2008)
* Confirmation that WASP-3b is an extrasolar planet (2008)
* High-resolution spectra of the first known double supernova, SN 2006jc (2007)

==Future developments==
The upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will require sophisticated adaptive optics in order to be used to their full capability. Because the WHT had an advanced adaptive optics system operating, it has received attention from the various ELT programs. , the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s European-ELT (E-ELT) project had a programme to utilise the WHT as a test-bed for its adaptive optics system, and received several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY will demonstrate the multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.

The UK&#x27;s STFC (originally the major financial contributor) has gradually reduced its funding for the ING telescopes over a number of years. Some of this funding shortfall has been made up by other partners increasing their contributions, and some by efficiency savings and cutbacks. As a result, the shares of observing time will become UK 33%, Netherlands 28%, Spain 34% and 5% for any nationality. A new development, started in 2010, is the development of a new wide-field multi-object spectroscopy facility (WEAVE), being developed by a UK-led consortium involving major contributions from the Netherlands, Spain, France, and Italy, the final installation of which was confirmed in August 2022. WEAVE will provide medium-high resolution spectroscopy in the visible (360–950 nm) range for up to 1000 simultaneous targets over a 2 degree field of view, and is currently expected to operate for several years.

<doc id="811345" wikidata="Q1276908" url="?curid=811345" title="Ealing Common tube station">
<text>Ealing Common is a London Underground station in the London Borough of Ealing, served by the District and Piccadilly lines. On the Ealing Broadway branch of the District line, the station is between Ealing Broadway and Acton Town stations. On the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line, it is between North Ealing and Acton Town stations. It is the only station west of Acton Town to be served by both the District and Piccadilly lines.

The station is located in Ealing on the Uxbridge Road (A4020), about east of the junction with Gunnersbury Avenue and Hanger Lane (A406, North Circular Road) and the Ealing Common open space the station takes its name from. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.

== History ==

Ealing Common station was opened on 1 July 1879 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) on its extension from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway. From 1886 until 1 March 1910 the station was known as Ealing Common and West Acton after which it changed to its current name.

On 23 June 1903, the DR opened an extension of the tracks from north of Ealing Common. The extension initially reached as far as Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey (closed and replaced by Park Royal in 1931), where the Royal Agricultural Society&#x27;s Park Royal show grounds had been recently opened, before being opened to South Harrow on 28 June 1903.

This new extension was, together with the existing tracks between Ealing Common and Acton Town, the first section of the Underground&#x27;s surface lines to be electrified and operate electric instead of steam trains. The deep level tube lines open at that time (City and South London Railway, Waterloo and City Railway, and Central London Railway) had been electrically powered from the start. Electric trains started running on the section of line between Ealing Common and Ealing Broadway on 1 July 1905.

During 1930 and 1931, a new station building was constructed to replace the 1879 building. The new building, by Charles Holden in a style reminiscent of his designs for the 1926 Morden extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line), was constructed in Portland stone and features a tall heptagonal ticket hall with glazed screens to all sides. The new building opened on 1 March 1931 and is very similar to the reconstructed station at Hounslow West built at the same time, also by Heaps and Holden.

On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly line was extended to run west of its original terminus at Hammersmith, sharing the route with the District line to Ealing Common. From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line and, from this date, District line trains west from Ealing Common run to Ealing Broadway only.

== The station today ==
There is a shop/kiosk available at times in the station booking hall area. Many trains leaving Ealing Common Depot enter service here. This is usually in the early morning, and in the westbound direction (towards Ealing Broadway Station).

Although it is possible for trains to enter the depot directly from platform one (the westbound platform), this rarely happens except for a few empty trains after the station is closed at night. However, at times of disruption it is possible for trains to arrive on platform one and, empty of passengers, then it would have to shunt forward in order to reverse and enter the depot. The train would then stable, or reverse into platform two in order to re-enter service and continue eastbound.

To the east of platform two, there are two siding roads. Those stop approximately halfway along the adjacent main-line road. They are separated from the platforms by a cement wall (behind which viewing is possible) and a wooden locked door from the platform. These roads are not connected directly to the main line, but to Ealing Common Depot and are used for shunting and reversing trains within the depot.

<text>Spencer Horatio Walpole (11 September 1806 – 22 May 1898) was a British Conservative Party politician who served three times as Home Secretary in the administrations of Lord Derby.

==Background and education==
Walpole was the second son of Thomas Walpole and Lady Margaret Perceval, youngest daughter of the 2nd Earl of Egmont and sister of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval. His grandfather was Thomas Walpole, son of the diplomat the 1st Baron Walpole, younger brother of Prime Minister the 1st Earl of Orford. Walpole was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He chose law as his profession, and was called to the Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1831. He built up a successful practice and was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1846.

==Political career==
Walpole then turned to politics, and in 1846 he was elected to Parliament for Midhurst as a Tory, a seat he would hold until 1856. He quickly gained a reputation in the House of Commons, and when the Tories came to power in early 1852 under Lord Derby, Walpole was appointed Home Secretary in the so-called &quot;Who? Who? Ministry&quot;. He was admitted to the Privy Council at the same time. However, the government fell in December 1852.

In 1854, Walpole was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

In 1856 Walpole was elected to Parliament for Cambridge University. Two years later the Tories (or the Conservatives as they became known during the 1850s) returned to office under Lord Derby. Walpole was again appointed Home Secretary, but resigned in January 1859 after disagreements over electoral reforms. The government was dismissed in July the same year. The Conservatives remained out of office for seven years, but in 1866 they again came to power under Derby, who made Walpole Home Secretary for the third time. However, he was severely criticised for his handling of the movement for parliamentary reform, and resigned in May 1867. He nonetheless continued to serve in the cabinet as Minister without Portfolio until February 1868, when Benjamin Disraeli became prime minister. Walpole never held office again, but remained a Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridge University until 1882.

==Family==
Walpole married his first cousin, Isabella Perceval, daughter of Spencer Perceval, in 1835. They had four children, two sons and two daughters. Their elder son Sir Spencer Walpole was a well-known historian. Walpole died in May 1898, aged 91.

It goes through three main larval stages along with a prezoeal stage to grow to its great size. 

The genus &quot;Macrocheira&quot; contains multiple species. Two fossil species of this genus have been found: &quot;M. ginzanensis&quot; and &quot;M. yabei&quot;, both from the Miocene of Japan. Its diverse taxonomic history is an important part of what these creatures are and how they evolved to be what they are today. They are sought by crab fisheries, and are considered a delicacy in Japan. To prevent overexploitation from harming the species, conservation efforts have been put in place to protect them and their population from overfishing. 

The Japanese giant spider crab is similar in appearance to the much smaller European spider crab &quot;(Maja squinado)&quot;, though the latter, while within the same superfamily, belongs to a different family: the Majidae.

==Description==
The Japanese spider crab has the greatest leg span of any known arthropod, reaching up to from claw to claw. The body may grow to in carapace width and the whole crab can weigh up to —second in mass only to the American lobster among all living arthropod species. The males have the longer chelipeds; females have much shorter chelipeds, which are shorter than the following pair of legs. 

Apart from its large size, the Japanese spider crab differs from other crabs in a number of ways. The first pleopods of males are unusually twisted, and the larvae appear primitive. The crab is orange with white spots along the legs. It is reported to have a gentle disposition despite its ferocious appearance. The Japanese Spider Crab also has a unique molting behavior that occurs for about 100 minutes, in which the crab loses its mobility and starts molting its carapace rear and ends with molting its walking legs. 

The Japanese spider crab has an armored exoskeleton that helps protect it from larger predators such as octopuses, but also uses camouflage. The crab&#x27;s bumpy carapace blends into the rocky ocean floor. To further the deception, a spider crab adorns its shell with sponges and other animals. The way in which a spider crab is able to pick up and cover itself with such organisms is by following a specific routine behavior. Upon picking up the object with the crab&#x27;s slender chelipeds, the chelae are used to twist and tear off the organism, such as a worm tube or sponge, from the substrate on which it currently resides. Once the material is picked up, it is brought to the crab&#x27;s mouthparts to specifically orient and shape it before it is attached to the exoskeleton. Then, through mechanical adhesion and secretions, the materials attach to the crab, and are able to regenerate, and colonize on the crab.

Unlike other species of crab, such as the Chilean crab &quot;Acanthonyx petiveri&quot;, the Japanese spider crab does not specifically look for matching colors to blend into its environment; it simply camouflages in a way that disguises its entire structure. This is most likely because Japanese spider crabs are nocturnally active, so instead of trying to disguise themselves when catching prey, they are actually just trying to avoid predators at night.

==Distribution and habitat==
Japanese spider crabs are mostly found off the southern coasts of the Japanese island of Honshū, from Tokyo Bay to Kagoshima Prefecture. Outlying populations have been found in Iwate Prefecture and off Su-ao in Taiwan. Adults are found at depths between . They like to inhabit vents and holes in the deeper parts of the ocean. The temperature preference of adults is unknown, but the species is regular at a depth of in Suruga Bay, where the water generally is about . Based on results from public aquaria, Japanese spider crabs tolerate temperatures between , but are typically maintained at .

The Japanese spider crab is an omnivore, consuming both plant-matter and animals. It also sometimes acts as a scavenger, consuming dead animals. Some have been known to scrape the ocean floor for plants and algae, while others pry open the shells of mollusks.

==Lifecycle==
Female crabs carry the fertilized eggs attached to their abdominal appendages until they hatch into tiny planktonic larvae. They can lay up to 1.5 million eggs per season, and these eggs hatch in 10 days on average. Once hatched, these larvae undergo four stages of development before they mature into adulthood. 

The first, or prezoeal, stage lasts only a matter of minutes, with most molting within 15 minutes to enter the first zoeal stage. It looks very different from its parents at this stage, with a small, transparent body. 

&quot;M. kaempferi&quot; undergoes two zoeal stages and a megalopa stage before it reaches adulthood. Each of these stages is influenced greatly by temperature, both in terms of survival and stage length. The optimum rearing temperature for all larval stages is thought to be between 15 and 18 °C, with survival temperatures ranging from . At these temperatures, the zoeal stages can last 7 to 18 days, with the megalopa stage lasting 25 to 45 days. Colder water is associated with longer durations in each stage. 

During the larval stages, &quot;M. kaempferi&quot; is found near the surface, as the planktonic forms drift with ocean currents. This surface water ranges between 12 and 15 °C during the hatching season (January to March). This is much warmer than the waters at depths below , where adults are found, with waters steadily around . Optimal temperatures have a 70% survival through the first zoeal stage, which is greatly reduced to a 30% survival in the second zoeal and megalopa stages.

==Taxonomic history==
The Japanese spider crab was originally described by Western science in 1836 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck under the name &quot;Maja kaempferi&quot;, based on material from Philipp Franz von Siebold collected near the artificial island Dejima. The specific epithet commemorates Engelbert Kaempfer, a German naturalist who lived in Japan from 1690 to 1692 and wrote about the country&#x27;s natural history. It was moved to the genus &quot;Inachus&quot; by Wilhem de Haan in 1839, but placed in a new subgenus, &quot;Macrocheira&quot;. That subgenus was raised to the rank of the genus in 1886 by Edward J. Miers. Placed in the family Inachidae, &quot;M. kaempferi&quot; does not fit cleanly into that group, and it may be necessary to erect a new family just for the genus &quot;Macrocheira&quot;. Four species of the genus &quot;Macrocheira&quot; are known from fossils:

*&quot;Macrocheira&quot; sp. – Pliocene Takanabe Formation, Japan
*&quot;M. ginzanensis&quot; – Miocene Ginzan Formation, Japan
*&quot;M. yabei&quot; – Miocene Yonekawa Formation, Japan
*&quot;M. teglandi&quot; – Oligocene, east of Twin River, Washington, United States

However, some evidence indicates that the genus &quot;Macrocheira&quot; does come from this family in some way due to its anatomical arrangements. This genus is similar in anatomical arrangement to the genus &quot;Oncinopus&quot;, seeming to preserve the earliest stage of anatomical evolution in the family Inachidae. The genus &quot;Onicinopus&quot; has a semi-hardened body, which allows the basal segment of the antennae, which articulates with the head capsule, to move. The antennulae which are segmented appendages between and below the eye stalks are connected. Like &quot;Oncinopus&quot;, the genus &quot;Macrocheira&quot; also has a seven-segmented abdomen and a basal segment of antennae that is mobile. &quot;Macrocheira&quot; also has orbital parts, the eye socket and features around it, that are similar to differentiated genera. Another differentiating feature is the supraorbital eave. It is part of the orbital region above the eyestalks. It projects laterally and becomes part of the spine. From the anatomical observations of this genus and others in the family Inachidae, &quot;Macrochiera&quot; was placed in the family Inachidae, descending from the genus &quot;Oncinpus&quot; and from it descending the genera &quot;Oreconia&quot;, &quot;Parapleisticantha&quot;, and &quot;Pleistincantha&quot;.

==Anatomy==

&quot;M. kaempferi&quot; is a giant crab with a pear-shaped carapace that is 350 mm (13.7 in) when measured on the median line. Its surface is covered in small spike-like projections or tubercles. The spine of an adult giant crab is short and curves outward at the tip. The spines in young giant crabs, though, are long compared to their carapaces, along with an uncurved spine. This proportionality explains, as in other decapod crustaceans, that spine size decreases as specimens grow older. As mentioned in the taxonomic section, this genus contains the family&#x27;s primitive feature of a movable antenna at the basal segment, but &quot;the development of a spine at the posterior angle of the supraocular eave, and the presence of intercalated spine and antennulary septum seem to attribute a rather high position to this genus.&quot; Lastly, differences are seen between the sexes. Adult males have very long front legs where the claws are located, but they are still shorter than the ambulatory legs of females, located in the back of the carapace.

==Fishery and conservation==
Temminck, in his original description, noted that the crab was known to the Japanese for the serious injuries it can cause with its strong claws. The Japanese spider crab is &quot;occasionally collected for food&quot;, and even considered a delicacy in many parts of Japan and other areas in the region. In total, were collected in 1976, but fell to only in 1985. The fishery is centred on Suruga Bay. The crabs are typically caught using small trawling nets. The population has decreased in number due to overfishing, forcing fishermen into exploring deeper waters to catch them. The average size caught by fishermen is a legspan of . Populations of this species of crab have diminished over recent years and many efforts are being made to protect them. One of the primary methods of recovery of the species being used is restocking artificially cultured juvenile crabs in fisheries. Additionally, laws have been put into place in Japan that prohibit fishermen from harvesting spider crabs from January through April, during their typical mating season when they are in shallower waters and more vulnerable to being caught. This protection method seeks to keep natural populations growing, and enables time for juvenile spider crabs to go through the early stages of their lifecycle.

<text>Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 is a London Underground station at Heathrow Airport on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, which serves Heathrow Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. It is between Heathrow Terminal 5 and Hatton Cross stations. It is also next to Heathrow Terminal 4 station in a one-way operation. The station also served Heathrow Terminal 1 until its closure in January 2016. The station is situated in Travelcard Zone 6, along with the nearby Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 railway station served by Heathrow Express and Elizabeth line services.

==History==
To cater to the rapid growth of road traffic to Heathrow Airport, several rail lines were considered to serve the airport. An average increment of 1 million passengers a year between 1953 and 1973, and rising issues with airline coach services from major terminals due to location, traffic congestion, larger aircraft capacity and increasing leisure travel further increased the need for public transport connections. Parliament considered two schemes, a spur of the Southern Railway from Feltham, and an extension of the Piccadilly line extension from Hounslow West. 

An extension of the Piccadilly line to serve the airport was approved with royal assent as the London Transport Act 1967 (c. xxxix) and British Railways Act 1967 (c. xxx) respectively on 27 July 1967. Partial government funding was obtained in April 1972 for the Piccadilly line extension, and the estimated cost of construction was £12.3 million. Construction of the extension began on 27 April 1971, with a groundbreaking by Sir Desmond Plummer, leader of the Greater London Council. On 19 July 1975, the line was extended to Hatton Cross as an interim terminus.

The station was opened as Heathrow Central by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 December 1977. At its opening, the station served as the terminus of what became known as the Heathrow branch of the line – previously it had been the Hounslow branch. It was the first time that an airport had been directly served by an underground railway system.

With the development of the airport&#x27;s new Terminal 4 underway for which a separate Underground station would be provided, the station was initially renamed Heathrow Central Terminals 1, 2, 3 from 3 September 1983, then renamed Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 on 6 October 1986. After the closure of Heathrow Terminal 1 in January 2016, the station was renamed to Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3, however, as of December 2023 signage on the platform still says &quot;Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3&quot;.

The Terminal 4 station is located on a unidirectional single track loop from Hatton Cross to Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3. On the opening of the Terminal 4 station, most direct services from Hatton Cross to Terminals 2 &amp; 3 ceased, with most Piccadilly line trains going first to Terminal 4. This meant that the westbound tunnel direct from Hatton Cross to Terminals 2&amp; 3 was hardly used for over 20 years. However, some early morning trains still went directly to Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3.

For the construction of the tunnel to the new Heathrow Terminal 5 station, the loop track and Terminal 4 station closed temporarily on 7 January 2005 and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 once again became the terminus of the line. This situation continued until 17 September 2006, when the Terminal 5 tunnel works were sufficiently complete for the loop tunnel and Terminal 4 station to reopen.
Heathrow Terminal 5 station opened on 27 March 2008, but the frequency of trains on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line remained the same as previously, with services from Hatton Cross to Heathrow split. Alternate trains run either to Terminal 4 (around the loop and back to Central London via Terminals 2 &amp; 3), or direct to Terminals 2 &amp; 3 and Terminal 5.

Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 has a double crossover immediately to the east which can be seen from the platform. This is used to allow trains to enter either platforms 1 or 2 heading westbound to terminate here. It is used for the last Heathrow service of the day Monday to Saturday and during times of service disruption. Also, a short distance to the west, are two further crossovers where the single track loop line from Terminal 4 rejoins the eastbound track from Terminal 5 to Terminals 2 &amp; 3.

The station has six escalators of which two operate from the platform to the ticket hall area and two operate in the opposite direction; the other two connect the ticket hall area to the surface. A mezzanine floor between the platform and ticket hall levels provide staff accommodation and facilities. British Transport Police maintain a presence at Heathrow.

Until 2012, free transfer was not possible between terminals, in contrast to the Heathrow Express. In January 2012, free travel was introduced for Oyster card and contactless payment card holders between the Heathrow stations on the Piccadilly line. Journeys from Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 or Heathrow Terminal 5 to Terminal 4 via the Piccadilly line require a change at Hatton Cross.

As of March 2012, the station had undergone renovation works which featured an extended control room, all six escalators refurbished, a station enhancement and two Step Free Access lifts from the ticket hall (located near the bottom of the escalators from street level) to the platforms. Step-free access to street level will continue to be served by the two airport lifts from the Coach station.

<doc id="811354" wikidata="Q1821884" url="?curid=811354" title="Levi Stubbs">
<text>Levi Stubbs (born Levi Stubbles, June 6, 1936 – October 17, 2008) was an American baritone singer, widely known as the lead vocalist of the R&amp;B group the Four Tops, that released a variety of Motown hit records during the 1960s and 1970s. He was noted for his powerful, emotional, and dramatic singing style. In 1990, Stubbs was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Four Tops.

Stubbs was also a voice artist in film and television, and provided the voice of &quot;Audrey II&quot;, the alien plant in the 1986 musical horror comedy film &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (an adaption of the stage musical of the same name), as well as Mother Brain in the 1989 TV series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. Stubbs was admired by his peers for his impressive vocal range, and influenced many later pop and soul artists, such as Daryl Hall of Hall and Oates.

Stubbs was born and spent much of his life in Detroit, Michigan. He had five children with his wife Clineice Stubbs, to whom he was married for almost 50 years. His last performance was at the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;50th Anniversary Concert&quot; on July 28, 2004, at the Detroit Opera House.

==Early life and music career==

Born in 1936 in Detroit, Michigan, Stubbs had a brother, Joe, who later became a member of 100 Proof (Aged in Soul), The Falcons, The Contours and The Originals. His cousin was Jackie Wilson. Stubbs attended Detroit Pershing High School, where he met Abdul &quot;Duke&quot; Fakir. He began his professional singing career with friends Fakir, Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson and Lawrence Payton, forming a singing group called the Four Aims in 1954.

Two years later, after signing with Chess Records, the group changed their name to the Four Tops. The name change was meant to avoid confusion with the then-popular Ames Brothers. The Four Tops began as a supper-club act before signing to Motown Records in 1963. By the end of the decade, they had over a dozen hits. The most popular of their hits (all of which featured Stubbs on lead vocals) include &quot;Ask the Lonely&quot;, &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the Same Old Song&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Turn to Stone&quot;, &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Love&quot;, &quot;Bernadette&quot;, &quot;Still Water (Love)&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Woman (Like the One I&#x27;ve Got)&quot;, as well as the late hit &quot;Loco In Acapulco&quot;.

Despite being the most prominent member of the group, Stubbs refused to have separate billing (in contrast to other Motown acts such as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and Diana Ross and the Supremes), and he also turned down several offers for a solo career, out of loyalty to his bandmates. Stubbs and the other Tops remained a team until Lawrence Payton died in 1997, at which point Theo Peoples took his place. The Four Tops were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2013. They have sold over 50 million records worldwide.

During the band&#x27;s long career it was signed to the Motown, ABC Dunhill, Arista and Casablanca record labels, and Stubbs&#x27; vocals influenced many later pop and soul artists, such as Daryl Hall of Hall and Oates. Hall has remarked that Stubbs&#x27; &quot;unique&quot; style rendered the Four Tops&#x27; material &quot;timeless&quot;. Other musical peers expressing admiration for the Four Tops&#x27; work include Lonnie Jordan of War and Smokey Robinson of The Miracles, among many others.

In 2000, Theo Peoples replaced Stubbs as lead singer after Stubbs suffered a stroke, with Ronnie McNeir taking the place that Lawrence Payton originally held. Renaldo Benson died on July 1, 2005, leaving Duke Fakir as the only surviving member of the Four Tops&#x27; original lineup until his death in July 2024. Stubbs&#x27; final performance with the Four Tops was at the group&#x27;s &quot;50th Anniversary Concert&quot; on July 28, 2004, at the Detroit Opera House.

===Voice acting===
Stubbs provided the voice of the carnivorous plant Audrey II in the 1986 film version of the musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, in which he sang the Oscar-nominated &quot;Mean Green Mother from Outer Space&quot;. He also was the voice of Mother Brain in the animated TV series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; (1989).

Stubbs also guest-starred in a number of TV shows as himself. Berry Gordy offered him the role of Louis McKay in the 1972 film &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, which would have starred him opposite Diana Ross as Billie Holiday. Stubbs turned the role down, however, once again not wishing to overshadow the other members of the Four Tops.

== Reputation ==
Stubbs has been regarded by some as one of the quintessential male soul singers. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Ed Hogan, Stubbs had a &quot;pleading urgency in his voice that perfectly captured the longing anxiousness of the songs written by the producing trio of Holland-Dozier-Holland&quot;. War band member Lonnie Jordan later told Billboard.com he felt &quot;blessed&quot; to meet Stubbs, and thought that the Four Tops singer&#x27;s &quot;voice was so good he was just, like, from another planet.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stubbs and his wife Clineice were married (for 48 years) from 1960 until his death in 2008. The couple had five children along with 11 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

==Death==
Stubbs was diagnosed with cancer in 1995, and after suffering a stroke in 2000, he was no longer able to tour with the Four Tops. He died in his sleep on October 17, 2008, at his home in Detroit. A memorial service for Stubbs was held at the Greater Grace Temple in Detroit on October 27. Many of Stubbs&#x27; friends from the music industry attended including Berry Gordy, Martha Reeves, Brian Holland, Ali-Ollie Woodson and Dennis Edwards. Detroit City Council member JoAnn Watson, along with Martha Reeves, presented a resolution naming Stubbs&#x27; birthday &quot;Levi Stubbs Day&quot; in Detroit. Stubbs is interred at Detroit&#x27;s historic Woodlawn Cemetery.

==Cultural references==
Stubbs features in Billy Bragg&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Levi Stubbs&#x27; Tears&quot;, about a woman whose Four Tops cassette brings her comfort through difficult times.

<doc id="811356" wikidata="Q1592614" url="?curid=811356" title="Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station">
<text>Heathrow Terminal 4 is a London Underground station at Heathrow Airport on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line. The next stations are Hatton Cross to the west and Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 in a one-way operation at the airport. The station is situated in Travelcard Zone 6.

==History==
In 1979, approval for a fourth terminal at Heathrow Airport was granted. An extension of the Piccadilly line to serve the new terminal was agreed in October 1981. The station box would be built by the British Airports Authority as part of the £200 million construction cost of the new terminal. By 1982, construction of the fourth terminal building was behind schedule, and in July 1982 the location of the station was moved from below the terminal building to a nearby car park.

Construction began in February 1983. London Regional Transport funded the construction of of new tunnels, the track and the fit-out of the station, at a cost of £23 million. Construction was completed by the November 1985. The station was officially opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on 1 April 1986, before opening the Terminal 4 itself shortly afterwards. Trains, however, did not stop at the station until 12 April, when the new terminal started to handle flights. 

The station is situated on a unidirectional loop tunnel which was constructed between the existing Hatton Cross and Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 stations. The station is one of four on the London Underground with only one platform, and is the only one with one-way train service. It is adjacent to Heathrow Terminal 4 railway station used by Elizabeth line services that travel through the newer mainline tunnel.

In-service routing took trains from Hatton Cross to Terminal 4 then Terminals 2 &amp; 3 and back to Hatton Cross. On 7 January 2005, both the loop track and the station were closed temporarily in order to allow the construction of a new rail junction to link to the new Heathrow Terminal 5 station. All trains reverted to using the original westbound track from Hatton Cross direct to Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 which was used prior to the opening of Heathrow Terminal 4. For passengers travelling to or from Heathrow Terminal 4, a shuttle bus was provided from Hatton Cross tube station. This situation continued until 17 September 2006 when the loop line and station were reopened after construction finished, with new security and customer announcement technologies in place at the station.

==Current routing==

Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station is located on a unidirectional clockwise loop that branches off after Hatton Cross westbound, and rejoins the Heathrow branch eastbound to the west of Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3.

Since the opening of Heathrow Terminal 5 station, alternate Heathrow branch trains run via the Terminal 4 loop, with the other alternate trains run directly to Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3, and Heathrow Terminal 5.

Until 2012, free transfer was not possible between terminals, in contrast to the Heathrow Express. In January 2012, free travel was introduced for Oyster card holders between the three Heathrow stations. But to travel from Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 or Terminal 5 to Terminal 4 one must change trains at Hatton Cross. This journey is free with Hatton Cross itself being part of the free travel zone.

On 9 May 2020, Heathrow Terminal 4 station closed temporarily until 14 June 2022, due to the closure of the airport&#x27;s Terminal 4 during the COVID-19 pandemic in London.

On 14 June 2022, this station reopened for passenger service.

==Connections==
Two London Buses routes serve the station: 482 and 490.

<text>Hatton Cross is a combined London Underground station and bus station in west London. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line between Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 or Heathrow Terminal 4 and Hounslow West stations. It is in Travelcard Zones 5 and 6 and stands between the Great South West Road (A30) and the Heathrow Airport Southern Perimeter Road. The station serves a large area including Feltham to the south and Bedfont to the west. The station was named after the crossroads of the Great South West Road and Hatton Road. 
The station, itself in the borough of Hillingdon, serves a very small residential community in Hatton, which is in the borough of Hounslow. The nearby area is partly within the airport but mainly includes its associated commercial warehousing and light industrial premises. &quot;Hatton Cross&quot; refers to the crossroads on the former coaching road leading south west, and is now applied to the overlying major road intersection immediately south east of the station.

Hatton Cross is also the nearest underground station to the popular plane spotting location of Myrtle Avenue, and for this reason is commonly used by plane spotters travelling to the area.

==History==
The station opened on 19 July 1975 in the first phase of the extension of the Piccadilly line from Hounslow West to Heathrow Airport and it remained the terminus until Heathrow Central opened on 16 December 1977.

On its opening in 1975, Hatton Cross was one of 279 active stations on the London Underground, the highest ever total; the number of stations in the network has since decreased to 272.
For the new Terminal 4 at the airport, a single track loop was tunnelled from Hatton Cross to Heathrow Central (now called &quot;Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3&quot;) with an intermediate new Terminal 4 station, which opened on 12 April 1986. The tube service to the airport then ran clockwise in a one-way loop from Hatton Cross to Terminal 4, on to Terminals 2 &amp; 3, and back to Hatton Cross.

On 7 January 2005, the loop and Terminal 4 station closed and the tube service reverted to its previous two-way running between Hatton Cross and the Terminals 2 &amp; 3 station while tunnels to the new Heathrow Terminal 5 station were under construction; a shuttle bus from Hatton Cross was provided for passengers travelling to and from Terminal 4. Service round the loop restarted on 17 September 2006.

==Operations and infrastructure==

Since 27 March 2008, when Terminal 5 station opened, alternate trains, of the twelve per hour arriving at Hatton Cross from London, have taken the Terminal 4 loop. These trains call at Heathrow Terminal 4, and then Terminals 2 &amp; 3, before heading back to London. The other alternate trains run to Heathrow Terminal 5, via Terminals 2 &amp; 3.

Just to the east of the station the Piccadilly line briefly resurfaces to cross the River Crane then descends back underground again, heading towards Hounslow West.

Immediately to the west of the station is the junction where the Terminal 4 loop diverges; this can be seen from the end of the westbound platform. This junction can be accessed only from the westbound track, thus there is no connection to the eastbound line where trains arrive from Terminals 2 &amp; 3.

==Architecture==
The platforms at Hatton Cross are in a cut and cover tunnel. The platform tiling on the central columns features patterns derived from the British Airways Speedbird logo, originally designed by Theyre Lee-Elliott in 1932. 

The station building, a brutalist, concrete-and-glass, single-storey box, incorporates a busy bus station, which serves the airport and the surrounding area. The concrete frieze at roof level which encircles the building is the work of the artist William Mitchell.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 90, 203, 285, 423, 482, 490, H25, H26 and Superloop route SL7 serve the adjacent bus station.

==Incidents==
The British Airways Flight 38 accident occurred just west of Hatton Cross in 2008.

<text>Hounslow West is a London Underground station in locality of Hounslow West in Hounslow within the London Borough of Hounslow, West London. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Hatton Cross and Hounslow Central stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 5. The station is located on Bath Road, close to the Great West Road (A4). The station has an island platform, with step-free access via a stairlift for manual wheelchair users only.

Opened as Hounslow Barracks in 1884, it was initially served by the District Railway (now part of the District line). The Piccadilly line was extended here in 1933, and District line services were fully withdrawn in 1964. The station building was rebuilt to a design by Charles Holden in 1931. The line was extended again in phases to Heathrow Airport in the 1970s, which resulted in the station&#x27;s platforms being relocated.

==Location==
The station is located on Bath Road (A3006) about from its junction with A4 Great West Road and Great South West Road (A30), and is surrounded by its car park. It serves mainly the commercial and residential area of western Hounslow, also called Hounslow West, but is also near Cranford and Heston. Hounslow West station is near Cavalry Barracks, which served as a reference for part of the old name of the station. Nearby landmarks include Beaversfield Park, Hounslow Medical Centre and St. Paul&#x27;s Church.

==History==

The station was opened as Hounslow Barracks on a single-track branch of the Hounslow &amp; Metropolitan Railway on 21 July 1884, which connected with the District Railway (DR, now part of the District line) at Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town). It was named in reference to the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow south of the station on Beavers Lane. Initially the only service was a shuttle to Osterley &amp; Spring Grove; this was replaced by a shuttle to Mill Hill Park on 31 March 1886. A new station, Heston–Hounslow (now Hounslow Central), was opened on the same day. The DR took over all of its railway services in 1903. The DR&#x27;s tracks were electrified between 1903 and 1905 with electric trains replacing steam trains on the Hounslow branch from 13 June 1905.

On 1 December 1925, the station was renamed to its present name. Within the same year, substantial provisions were made to extend the Piccadilly line to relieve capacity on the District line. The former would take over services on the Hounslow and Uxbridge branches. The line, being still single-tracked, was doubled in stages. Works were completed on 27 November 1926, with the station&#x27;s alignment reconfigured to have three platforms and brought into use on 11 December. The oldest platform furthest to the south was not reopened until 27 March 1927, with the original station still &quot;in situ&quot;. Between 1930 and 1931, a new station building was constructed facing onto Bath Road to replace the original building which was parallel with the tracks and set back at an angle from the road. The original building was gradually demolished, and the new building opened on 5 July 1931. Piccadilly line services, which had been running as far as Northfields since 9 January 1933, were extended to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933. From that date, the branch was jointly operated by both lines. District line services were progressively reduced to rush-hour only services in the late 1950s; they were withdrawn on 9 October 1964.

===Heathrow extension===
An extension of the line from Hounslow West to serve Heathrow Airport had been planned since the 1960s. Formal approval was given in 1967, and work began with a groundbreaking ceremony by Sir Desmond Plummer on 27 April 1971. The original alignment of the tracks and platforms at Hounslow West was too skewed from the extension. The new alignment was to relocate the station platforms underground, with cut and cover tunnels along Bath Road and Great South West Road. The line surfaces briefly over the River Crane before descending to reach Hatton Cross towards Heathrow. The new rerouted tracks meant that the existing had to be reduced to single track operation until the station approach. Platform 3, being the northernmost, was decommissioned early on 22 October 1971 due to being situated right on the path of the new track alignment. The old DR signal box was also taken out of service, with a temporary one built near Platform 1. Some of the tracks were demolished in June 1975 for further excavation and track simplification works. The new platforms were brought into use on 14 July 1975 and the line was opened as far as Hatton Cross five days later on 19 July. The existing 1930s station building was kept, and a new link was constructed to connect to the new platforms. The line was further extended to Heathrow on 16 December 1977. The old platforms were demolished and was filled in, creating around 400 car parking spaces.

==The station today==

When the Piccadilly line was planned to be extended here, the station was to receive a new station building. Charles Holden, who was part of the Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson architectural practice, designed the exteriors under the supervision of Stanley Heaps on-site. The new building is in a style reminiscent of Holden&#x27;s designs for the 1926 Morden extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line). Basil Ionides designed the interior of the ticket hall. Portland stone was used for the facade, strengthened by a reinforced concrete base. Its front is constructed of granite, while its rear is made of bricks. Glazed screens are fitted onto all sides of the tall heptagonal ticket hall, with an adjoined rectangular shopfront. In addition to its drum shape being heptagonal, its ceiling motif contains this pattern, with a chandelier featuring seven lamps of the same geometry. A wooden ticket booth (known as a passimeter) sits in the middle of the ticket hall, albeit now disused. The building is very similar to the reconstructed station at Ealing Common built at the same time, also by Heaps and Holden. The station is a Grade II listed building.

The station has two platforms for the Piccadilly line, located below surface level. Platform 1 is for trains to Heathrow Airport, while Platform 2 is allocated to services bound for Cockfosters. These were built in 1975 together with the steel bridge connected to the ticket hall. As with other stations on the Heathrow extension, artwork was to be installed on the new platforms, with a station motif designed by Tom Eckersley. However the artwork was never installed. The platforms are reached by flights of stairs and a stairlift, which makes the station step-free for manual wheelchair users only. It is also the only London Underground station to be wheelchair accessible for manual wheelchair users only.

== Future ==
In the late 2010s, the station car park at Hounslow West was proposed by Transport for London (TfL) for property development, as part of TfL&#x27;s plans to increase the amount of income generated from land in their ownership. , over 400 new affordable homes are currently planned to be built on the current car park at the station by housing association A2Dominion. The proposals also include a new public square, retail space and a smaller amount of replacement station car parking.

==Services and connections==
Hounslow West station is between Hatton Cross and Hounslow Central stations on the Hounslow branch of the Piccadilly line, in Travelcard Zone 5. As of 2020, typical off-peak services, in trains per hour (tph), are as follows:
*12 tph eastbound to Cockfosters
*6 tph westbound to Heathrow Terminals 2,3 and 5
*6 tph westbound via the Heathrow Terminal 4 loop

Night tube is also operational on this part of the line, with a train every 10 minutes in both directions between Heathrow Terminal 5 and Cockfosters.

London Buses routes 81, 203, 222, 482, H28, H32, H91, H98 and night route N9 serve the station. Formerly, airport shuttle services from different bus companies began here. However most of them relocated their termini to Hatton Cross in conjunction with the Piccadilly line extension there in 1975. Notably, the A1 express service picked up passengers from the station, but this ceased when the Heathrow extension opened in 1977.

==Notable commutes==
Winston Churchill recalls travelling to Hounslow Barracks two or three times a week whilst living at his mother&#x27;s house in Knightsbridge around 1896.

<text>Hounslow Central is a London Underground station in Hounslow in West London. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Hounslow West and Hounslow East stations. The station is located on Lampton Road (A3005) about 500m north of Hounslow High Street and close to Lampton Park. It is in Travelcard Zone 4. The station has an island platform reached by stairs. The station also has male and female toilets inside the ticket gateline.

==History==

The route through Hounslow Central station was opened by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) on 21 July 1884 as a branch to Hounslow Barracks (now Hounslow West). The branch line was constructed as single track from the DR&#x27;s existing route to Hounslow Town station located at the eastern end of Hounslow High Street which had opened in 1883. Initially the branch had no stations between the terminus at Hounslow Barracks and Osterley &amp; Spring Grove (now Osterley).

Hounslow Town station was closed on 31 March 1886 and Hounslow Central station, originally named Heston &amp; Hounslow, opened as its replacement the following day, 1 April 1886.

In 1903 Hounslow Town was reopened and trains would be divided at Osterley with part running to Hounslow Central and Hounslow West and the other part to Hounslow Town as a short shuttle. Electrification of the DR&#x27;s tracks took place between 1903 and 1905 with electric trains replacing steam trains on the Hounslow branch from 13 June 1905. When the branch was electrified, the track between Osterley and Hounslow Central was closed and a new loop was opened from Hounslow Town back to Hounslow Central. Trains would run from Osterley to Hounslow Town then reverse and run to Hounslow Central and on to Hounslow West.

This method of operation was unsuccessful and short-lived. On 2 May 1909 the track between Hounslow Central and Osterley was reopened and Hounslow Town and its two loop tracks were closed for good. A new Hounslow Town station (now Hounslow East) was opened at the same time between Hounslow Central and Osterley.

On 19 October 1912 new station buildings were opened at Hounslow Central and on 1 December 1925 the station was given its present name at the same time that Hounslow West and Hounslow East received their current names.
Piccadilly line services, which had been running as far as Northfields since January 1933 were extended to run to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933. From this date, the branch was operated jointly by both lines until District line services were withdrawn on 9 October 1964.

<text>Hounslow East is a London Underground station in Hounslow, in the London Borough of Hounslow. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Hounslow Central and Osterley stations. The station is located on Kingsley Road and is in Travelcard Zone 4. It is situated 10.5 miles (16.9 km) west-southwest of Charring Cross.

==History==
The route through Hounslow East station was opened by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) on 21 July 1884 as a branch to Hounslow Barracks (now Hounslow West). The branch line was constructed as single track from the DR&#x27;s existing route to Hounslow Town station located at the eastern end of Hounslow High Street where the bus garage is now located. That station had opened in 1883. Initially the branch to Hounslow Barracks had no stations between there and Osterley &amp; Spring Grove (replaced by Osterley in 1934).

Hounslow Town station was closed on 31 March 1886 and Heston &amp; Hounslow station (now Hounslow Central), opened as its replacement the following day, 1 April 1886.

In 1903 Hounslow Town station was reopened and trains would be divided at Osterley &amp; Spring Grove station, with part running to Hounslow West and the other part to Hounslow Town as a short shuttle. Electrification of the DR&#x27;s tracks took place between 1903 and 1905 with electric trains replacing steam trains on the Hounslow branch from 13 June 1905. When the branch was electrified, the track between Osterley &amp; Spring Grove station and Hounslow Central was closed and a new loop was opened from Hounslow Town back to Hounslow Central. Trains would run from Osterley to Hounslow Town then reverse and run over the new loop to reach the main line and so continue to Hounslow West.
This method of operation was unsuccessful and short-lived. On 2 May 1909 the track between Heston &amp; Hounslow station (now Hounslow Central) and Osterley &amp; Spring Grove station was reopened with Hounslow East station (initially called Hounslow Town) as a new station located about west of the loop to the old station. The old Hounslow Town station and its two loop tracks were closed for good. Part of the embankment that carried the original single track to Hounslow Town Station (now Hounslow Bus garage) is still visible, just east of Hounslow East station.

On 1 December 1925 the station was given its present name at the same time that Hounslow West and Hounslow Central received their current names.

Piccadilly Line services, which had been running as far as Northfields since January 1933 were extended to run to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933. From this date, the branch was operated jointly by both lines until District Line services were withdrawn on 9 October 1964.

New station buildings, to designs by Acanthus Lawrence and Wrightson Architects, have now replaced the old ones . Phase 1 of the scheme, which was completed in July 2002, required the excavation of the existing embankment and provided a new ticket hall with ancillary staff accommodation, interchange passageway and stairs to each platform. The second phase which involved the construction of the eastbound platform building, with a striking green roof, completed early 2003. As part of the works lifts have been provided to both platforms.

Staff frequently play classical music on the PA system as part of an experiment to discourage anti-social activities at the station.

==Services==
Typical off-peak services are generally as follows: 

• 12 tph to Cockfosters or Arnos Grove

• 6 tph to Heathrow Terminal 4

• 6 tph to Heathrow Terminal 5

Eastbound trains towards central London run express between Acton Town and Hammersmith, with trains making an additional stop at Turnham Green in the early mornings and late evenings. Night Tube services operate every 10 minutes between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5 on Friday and Saturday nights.

London Buses routes 111 and H28 directly serve the station. Hounslow Bus Station is located 0.2 miles south of the station, served by routes 81, 110, 111, 116, 117, 120, 203, 222, 281, 423, 635, 681, H22, H28, H32, H37, H98 and N9.

<text>Boston Manor is a London Underground station at the boundary of the boroughs of Hounslow and Ealing. It is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Osterley and Northfields stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 4.

The station is on a street-level bridge over the line on Boston Manor Road, serving the neighbourhood around Boston Manor House, north-west of Brentford, and southern parts of Hanwell. Opened in 1883 by the District Railway, it was reconstructed in 1932 to a Grade II-listed building. Designed by architect Charles Holden, the Art Deco styled structure features a tall tower which acts as a landmark of the area. The station was once served by both the Piccadilly and District lines, with the latter having its last service withdrawn in 1964.

==Location==
Boston Manor station entrance is on Boston Manor Road, and the station serves a small residential area in Brentford. The station sits close to the boundary between the London Borough of Hounslow and London Borough of Ealing. Nearby places include Boston Manor playing fields, Elthorne Park high school, Gunnersbury Boys School and Swyncombe playing field. The Grand Union Canal and Brent river are also accessible from the station. Northfields depot is just to the east of the station. Boston Manor dates back to the 1170s as &quot;Bordwadestone&quot;, which referred to Bord&#x27;s tun, or farm, by the stone. The Jacobean mansion named Boston Manor House was constructed in 1622–23, and is also near the station.

==History==

In 1866, permission was given to local landowners for a Hounslow and Metropolitan Railway, which would serve areas in Hounslow such as Boston Manor, and to connect to another proposed line called the Acton &amp; Brentford railway. However, the latter was never constructed but instead a extension of the District Railway (DR) from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town) to Hounslow Barracks (now Hounslow West) was considered and granted.

Boston Manor was initially opened by the DR on 1 May 1883 as part of an extension from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow Town. The station was originally named Boston Road. The signs on the platforms gave the name as Boston Manor &quot;for Brentford &amp; Hanwell&quot;. Electrification of the DR&#x27;s tracks took place between 1903 and 1905 with electric trains replacing steam trains on the Hounslow branch from 13 June 1905. Northfield (Ealing) Halt (now Northfields), the next stop to the east was only opened on 16 April 1908. The station was given its current name on 11 December 1911.

To prepare for the Piccadilly line extension to Hounslow, the station was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934 in a Modernist style which replaced the 1883 station building. During the reconstruction, a temporary booking hall was built. Most of the platform infrastructure was kept, partly due to its substantial buildings compared to other stations. Piccadilly line services, which had been running as far as Northfields since 9 January 1933, were extended to run to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933 when the partially completed Boston Manor station was opened to passengers. The new station building was finally completed on 25 March 1934.

Because of the Piccadilly line extension, the off-peak District line service through the station was converted to a Hounslow West to South Acton shuttle. This was discontinued on 29 April 1935 while peak hour services were withdrawn completely on 9 October 1964.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step-free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the network.

==Station features==
The original 1883 station building was built by the District Railway. It was a red brick building with an enamel pecked half roundel attached to the arched window space above the booking office entrance. A lampshade branded Tiffany was above the roundel. The original stairs to the platforms with cast iron balustrades are retained. The fretted wooden awnings at the platform remain intact, with the canopy pillars painted black and yellow. Cast iron columns with capitals and octagonal bases provide support for the part-glazed timber roof on iron trusses.

The new station building occupies a narrow site due to the nearby depot, where it was built out over the tracks. It features a Modernist style design by Stanley Heaps, in consultation with Charles Holden. The main structure is of brown bricks and reinforced concrete, topped by a flat roof. Inspired by contemporary Dutch and German architecture, the distinctive tower functions as a landmark within the low-height suburban residential area. The tower is decorated with glazed ceramic tiles and pasted with an enamelled London Underground logo. The upper stages of the tower are fitted with a vertical strip of glass bricks which is part of a lighting feature. The booking hall sits to the right of the single-storey structure, lit with clerestory windows. The ticket office kiosk retains its banded tile decoration. A curved shop unit adjoins to the left side of the structure. Metal-framed windows were added to the western ends of the shelters at platform level.
The station, architecturally noted for Holden&#x27;s Art Deco design, was granted Grade II Listed status on 21 March 2002. On 9 January 2013, the station appeared on a British postage stamp as part of a set commemorating the 150th anniversary of the first London underground train journey. The stamp&#x27;s caption read &quot;Boston Manor Art Deco Station&quot;. The station also has a Labyrinth puzzle, which is installed at all stations on the Underground network. This labyrinth puzzle is part of the Woodcut family, installed at the top of the stairs leading to eastbound Platform 2, next to a booking office window.

William Eggleston was born in Memphis, Tennessee and raised in Sumner, Mississippi. His father was an engineer and his mother was the daughter of a prominent local judge. As a boy, Eggleston was introverted; he enjoyed playing the piano, drawing, and working with electronics. From an early age, he was also drawn to visual media and reportedly enjoyed buying postcards and cutting out pictures from magazines.

At the age of 15, Eggleston was sent to the Webb School, a boarding establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, &quot;It had a kind of Spartan routine to &#x27;build character&#x27;. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was the kind of place where it was considered effeminate to like music and painting.&quot; Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. &quot;I never had the feeling that I didn&#x27;t fit in,&quot; he told a reporter, &quot;But probably I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Eggleston attended Vanderbilt University for a year, Delta State College for a semester, and the University of Mississippi for about five years, but did not complete any degree. Nonetheless, his interest in photography took root when a friend at Vanderbilt gave Eggleston a Leica camera. He was introduced to abstract expressionism at Ole Miss by visiting painter Tom Young.

==Artistic development==

Eggleston&#x27;s early photographic efforts were inspired by the work of Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank, and by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s book, &quot;The Decisive Moment.&quot; Eggleston later recalled that the book was &quot;the first serious book I found, from many awful books...I didn&#x27;t understand it a bit, and then it sank in, and I realized, my God, this is a great one.&quot; First photographing in black-and-white, Eggleston began experimenting with color in 1965 and 1966 after being introduced to the format by William Christenberry. Color transparency film became his dominant medium in the later 1960s. Eggleston&#x27;s development as a photographer seems to have taken place in relative isolation from other artists. In an interview, John Szarkowski describes his first encounter with the young Eggleston in 1969 as being &quot;absolutely out of the blue&quot;. After reviewing Eggleston&#x27;s work (which he recalled as a suitcase full of &quot;drugstore&quot; color prints) Szarkowski prevailed upon the Photography Committee of MoMA to buy one of Eggleston&#x27;s photographs.

In 1970, Eggleston&#x27;s friend William Christenberry introduced him to Walter Hopps, director of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Corcoran Gallery. Hopps later reported being &quot;stunned&quot; by Eggleston&#x27;s work: &quot;I had never seen anything like it.&quot;

Eggleston taught at Harvard in 1973 and 1974, and it was during these years that he discovered dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: &quot;It advertised &#x27;from the cheapest to the ultimate print.&#x27; The ultimate print was a dye transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the color saturation and the quality of the ink were overwhelming. I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one.&quot; The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston&#x27;s most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled &quot;The Red Ceiling&quot;, of which Eggleston said, &quot;The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact, I&#x27;ve never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that&#x27;s wet on the wall... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge.&quot;

At Harvard, Eggleston prepared his first portfolio, entitled &quot;14 Pictures&quot; (1974). Eggleston&#x27;s work was exhibited at MoMA in 1976. Although this was over three decades after MoMa had mounted a solo exhibition of color photographs by Eliot Porter, and a decade after MoMA had exhibited color photographs by Ernst Haas, the tale that the Eggleston exhibition was MoMA&#x27;s first exhibition of color photography is frequently repeated, and the 1976 show is regarded as a watershed moment in the history of photography, by marking &quot;the acceptance of colour photography by the highest validating institution&quot;.

Around the time of his 1976 MoMA exhibition, Eggleston was introduced to Viva, the Andy Warhol &quot;superstar&quot;, with whom he began a long relationship. During this period Eggleston became familiar with Andy Warhol&#x27;s circle, a connection that may have helped foster Eggleston&#x27;s idea of the &quot;democratic camera&quot;, Mark Holborn suggests. Also in the 1970s, Eggleston experimented with video, producing several hours of roughly edited footage Eggleston calls &quot;Stranded in Canton&quot;. Writer Richard Woodward, who has viewed the footage, likens it to a &quot;demented home movie&quot;, mixing tender shots of his children at home with shots of drunken parties, public urination, and a man biting off a chicken&#x27;s head before a cheering crowd in New Orleans. Woodward suggests that the film is reflective of Eggleston&#x27;s &quot;fearless naturalism—a belief that by looking patiently at what others ignore or look away from, interesting things can be seen.&quot;

Eggleston&#x27;s published books and portfolios include &quot;Los Alamos&quot; (completed in 1974, but published much later), &quot;William Eggleston&#x27;s Guide&quot; (the catalog of the 1976 MoMa exhibit), the massive &quot;Election Eve&quot; (1977; a portfolio of photographs taken around Plains, Georgia, the rural seat of Jimmy Carter before the 1976 presidential election), &quot;The Morals of Vision&quot; (1978), &quot;Flowers&quot; (1978), &quot;Wedgwood Blue&quot; (1979), &quot;Seven&quot; (1979), &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (1980), &quot;The Louisiana Project&quot; (1980), &quot;William Eggleston&#x27;s Graceland&quot; (1984; a series of commissioned photographs of Elvis Presley&#x27;s Graceland, depicting the singer&#x27;s home as an airless, windowless tomb in custom-made bad taste), &quot;The Democratic Forest&quot; (1989), &quot;Faulkner&#x27;s Mississippi&quot; (1990), and &quot;Ancient and Modern&quot; (1992).

Some of his early series were not shown until the late 2000s. The &quot;Nightclub Portraits&quot; (1973), a series of large black-and-white portraits in bars and clubs around Memphis was, for the most part, not shown until 2005. &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, part of Eggleston&#x27;s &quot;Los Alamos&quot; series, is a body of photographs that have remained unseen for decades because until 2008 no one knew that they belonged to Walter Hopps; the works from this series chronicle road trips the artist took with Hopps, leaving from Memphis and traveling as far as the West Coast. Eggleston&#x27;s &quot;Election Eve&quot; photographs were not editioned until 2011.

Eggleston also worked with filmmakers, photographing the set of John Huston&#x27;s film &quot;Annie&quot; (1982) and documenting the making of David Byrne&#x27;s film &quot;True Stories&quot; (1986).

In 2017, an album of Eggleston&#x27;s music was released, &quot;Musik.&quot; It comprises 13 &quot;experimental electronic soundscapes&quot;, &quot;often dramatic improvisations on compositions by Bach (his hero) and Handel as well as his singular takes on a Gilbert and Sullivan tune and the jazz standard On the Street Where You Live.&quot; &quot;Musik&quot; was made entirely on a 1980s Korg synthesiser, and recorded to floppy disks. The 2017 compilation &quot;Musik&quot; was produced by Tom Lunt, and released on Secretly Canadian. In 2018, Áine O&#x27;Dwyer performed the music on a pipe organ at the Big Ears music festival in Knoxville, Tennessee.

==Eggleston&#x27;s aesthetic==

Eggleston&#x27;s mature work is characterized by its ordinary subject matter. As Eudora Welty noted in her introduction to &quot;The Democratic Forest&quot;, an Eggleston photograph might include &quot;old tires, Dr. Pepper machines, discarded air-conditioners, vending machines, empty and dirty Coca-Cola bottles, torn posters, power poles and power wires, street barricades, one-way signs, detour signs, No Parking signs, parking meters, and palm trees crowding the same curb.&quot;

Eudora Welty suggests that Eggleston sees the complexity and beauty of the mundane world: &quot;The extraordinary, compelling, honest, beautiful and unsparing photographs all have to do with the quality of our lives in the everyday world: they succeed in showing us the grain of the present, like the cross-section of a tree... They focus on the mundane world. But &quot;no&quot; subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!&quot; Mark Holborn, in his introduction to &quot;Ancient and Modern,&quot; writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston&#x27;s lens: &quot;[Eggleston&#x27;s] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane. The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images there is a sense of lurking danger.&quot; American artist Edward Ruscha said of Eggleston&#x27;s work, &quot;When you see a picture he&#x27;s taken, you&#x27;re stepping into some kind of jagged world that seems like Eggleston World.&quot;

According to Philip Gefter from &quot;Art &amp; Auction&quot;, &quot;It is worth noting that Stephen Shore and William Eggleston, pioneers of color photography in the early 1970s, borrowed, consciously or not, from the photorealists. Their photographic interpretation of the American vernacular—gas stations, diners, parking lots—is foretold in photorealist paintings that preceded their pictures.&quot;

==Art market==
In 2012, three dozen of Eggleston&#x27;s larger-format prints – instead of the original format of – sold for $5.9 million in an auction at Christie&#x27;s to benefit the Eggleston Artistic Trust, an organization dedicated to the preservation of the artist&#x27;s work. The top lot, &quot;Untitled 1970&quot;, set a world auction record for a single print by the photographer at $578,000.

New York art collector Jonathan Sobel subsequently filed a lawsuit in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Eggleston, alleging that the artist&#x27;s decision to print and sell oversized versions of some of his famous images in an auction has diluted the rarity—and therefore the resale value—of the originals. The court later dismissed the lawsuit.

==Photographs in notable publications==

The earliest commercial use of Eggleston&#x27;s art was on album covers for the Memphis group Big Star, with whom Eggleston recorded for the album &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; and who used his photograph &quot;The Red Ceiling&quot; on their album &quot;Radio City.&quot; Eggleston&#x27;s photograph of dolls on a Cadillac hood featured on the cover of the Alex Chilton album &quot;Like Flies on Sherbert.&quot; The Primal Scream album &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; features a cropped photograph of a neon Confederate flag and a palm tree by Eggleston. His photographs were used for the front and back covers of the CD release of long-time friend and fellow photographer Terry Manning&#x27;s album &quot;Christopher Idylls&quot; (1994). His photograph &quot;Memphis (1968)&quot; was used as the cover of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s album &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001).

In 2006, an Eggleston image was used as both the cover to Primal Scream&#x27;s single &quot;Country Girl&quot; and the paperback edition of Ali Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Accidental&quot;. The same picture had already been used on the cover of Chuck Prophet&#x27;s &quot;Age of Miracles&quot; album in 2004.

Eggleston&#x27;s photos also appear on &quot;Tanglewood Numbers&quot; by the Silver Jews, &quot;Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band&quot; by Joanna Newsom, &quot;Transference&quot; by Spoon and &quot;Delta Kream&quot; by the Black Keys.

<doc id="811392" wikidata="Q271575" url="?curid=811392" title="Pearl White">
<text>Pearl Fay White (March 4, 1889 – August 4, 1938) was an American stage and film actress. She began her career on the stage at age 6, and later moved on to silent films appearing in a number of popular serials.

Dubbed the &quot;Queen of the Serials&quot;, White was noted for doing the majority of her own stunts, most notably in &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;. Often cast as a plucky onscreen heroine, White&#x27;s roles directly contrasted those of the popularized archetypal ingénue.

== Early life ==
White was born in Green Ridge, Missouri to Edgar White, a farmer, and Lizzie G. House. She had four brothers and sisters. The family later moved to Springfield, Missouri. At age 6, she made her stage debut as &quot;Little Eva&quot; in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. When she was 13, White worked as a bareback rider for the circus.

== Career ==
She began performing with the Diemer Theater Company while in her second year of high school. Against the wishes of her father, White dropped out of school, and in 1907, she went on the road with the Trousedale Stock Company, working evening shows while keeping her day job to help support her family. She soon joined the company full-time, touring through the American Midwest.

White played minor roles for several years, when she was spotted by the Powers Film Company in New York. She claimed she had performed in Cuba for a time under the name Miss Mazee, singing American songs in a dance hall. Her travels as a singer also took her to South America.

In 1910, White had trouble with her throat, and her voice began to fail from the nightly theatrical performances. She made her debut in films that year, starring in a series of one-reel dramas and comedies for Pat Powers in the Bronx. It was at Powers Films that White honed her skills at physical comedy and stunt work. She became a popular player with the company and caught the attention of Pathé Frères.

In 1910, White was offered a role by Pathé Frères in &quot;The Girl from Arizona&quot;, the French company&#x27;s first American film produced at their studio in Bound Brook, New Jersey. She then worked at Lubin Studios in 1911 and several other of the independent studios, until the Crystal Film Company in Manhattan gave her top billing in a number of slapstick comedy shorts from 1912 to 1914. White then took a vacation in Europe. Upon her return, she signed with Eclectic Film Company, a subsidiary of Pathé in 1914.

Pathé director Louis J. Gasnier offered her the starring role in film serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, based on a story by playwright Charles W. Goddard. The film features the central character Pauline in a story involving considerable action, for which the athletic Pearl White proved ideally suited. &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; consisted of 20 two-reel episodes that were released weekly. The serial proved to be a hit with audiences and made White a major celebrity; she soon was earning $1,750 per week. She followed this serial with an even bigger box-office hit: &quot;The Exploits of Elaine&quot; (1914–1915).

Over the next five years, White appeared in the popular serials &quot;The New Exploits of Elaine&quot; (1915), &quot;The Romance of Elaine&quot; (1915), &quot;The Iron Claw&quot; (1916), &quot;Pearl of the Army&quot; (1916–1917), &quot;The Fatal Ring&quot; (1917), &quot;The House of Hate&quot; (1918), &quot;The Lightning Raider&quot; (1919) and &quot;The Black Secret&quot; (1919–1920). In these serials, White flew airplanes, raced cars, swam across rivers, and did other similar feats. She did much of her own stunt work until Pathé decided that it could not risk injuring one of its popular stars. (She had already injured her spine during the filming of &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, an injury that caused her pain for the rest of her life.)

A male stunt double wearing a wig performed the majority of the more dangerous stunts in White&#x27;s later films. The public was largely unaware that White and other actors used stunt doubles, but in August 1922, the truth was revealed. During the filming of White&#x27;s final serial &quot;Plunder&quot;, John Stevenson, an actor who was doubling for White, was supposed to leap from the top of a bus on 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue onto an elevated girder. He missed the girder and struck his head. Stevenson died of a fractured skull. After the filming of &quot;Plunder&quot; was complete, White traveled to Europe for another vacation.

By 1919, White had grown tired of film serials and signed with Fox Film Corporation with the ambition to appear in dramatic roles, including J. Searle Dawley&#x27;s A Virgin Paradise, filmed near Harrington Sound in the British Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, 640 miles off North Carolina where Searle had previously filmed The Relief of Lucknow and For Valour in 1912. Animals, including monkeys and lions, were imported for the production. On December 21, 1920, Dawley received a cable at 8:25 AM at the Princess Hotel urging that White, who had previously visited Bermuda in 1913, leave Bermuda that day for New York aboard the RMS &quot;Fort Victoria&quot;. As the ship had already departed from the City of Hamilton, she was flown by a seaplane of the Bermuda and West Atlantic Aviation Company from the Princess Hotel to board the ship at Murray&#x27;s Anchorage before it passed through Hurd&#x27;s channel onto the open Atlantic Ocean. White was photographed boarding the seaplane by the proprietors of the Bermuda and West Atlantic Aviation Company, Major Henry Hamilton &quot;Hal&quot; Kitchener (the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Walter Kitchener) and Major Harold Hemming. Over the next two years, White appeared in 10 drama films for Fox but her popularity had begun to wane.

== Later years ==

At the Pathé movie studio, she met Blanche Rubenstein (later married Claude Auzello) and both travelled to France where White hoped to reboot her acting career. Influenced by her French friends from Pathé, White was drawn to the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris. While living there, she made her last film for her friend, Belgian-born director Edward José, who had directed her in several serials. Silent films could be made in any country, and as White was a recognizable star worldwide, she was offered many roles in France. She made &quot;Terreur&quot; (released as &quot;The Perils of Paris&quot; in the United States), her final film, in France in 1924. White returned to the stage in a Montmartre production &quot;Tu Perds la Boule&quot;. In 1925, she accepted an offer to star with comedian Max Wall in the &quot;London Review&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre in London, where she earned $3,000 per week. She then retired from performing.

By the time she retired from films in 1924, White had amassed a fortune of $2 million ($ million in ). A shrewd businesswoman, she invested in a successful Parisian nightclub, a Biarritz resort hotel/casino, and a stable of 10 race horses. White divided her time between her townhouse in Passy and a 54-acre estate near Rambouillet. She became involved with Theodore Cossika, a Greek businessman, who shared her love of travel. Together, they purchased a home near Cairo.

According to published reports after her death, White&#x27;s friends claimed that she intended to make a comeback in sound films. White later told friends that after she made a test for sound films in 1929, she was told that her voice was unsuitable. White made occasional visits to the United States in 1924, 1927, and 1937. On her last visit, White told reporters she was not interested in making a comeback and mused that acting in silent films was more difficult than acting in sound films. By this time, White had gained a substantial amount of weight. She told reporters she did not like to be photographed as she felt that photos made her face look fat, adding &quot;Why should I have my picture taken when I can get paid for it?&quot;

== Personal life ==
White was married twice and had no children. She married actor Victor Sutherland on October 10, 1907. They divorced in 1914. In 1913 she lived with Jane Fearnley, an early film actress. In 1919, she married actor Wallace McCutcheon Jr., son of pioneering cinematographer and director Wallace McCutcheon Sr. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1921.

== Death ==
By 1937, White was dying of liver failure. The injury she sustained to her spine while filming &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; had continued to cause her pain, which she eased with drugs and alcohol. A year before her death, White got her affairs in order, purchased a plot in Cimetière de Passy (Passy Cemetery) near her home and arranged her own funeral.

In early July 1938, she checked herself into the American Hospital of Paris in the suburb of Neuilly due to issues with her liver. She slipped into a coma on August 3, 1938, and died the following day of what was identified in her obituaries as a &quot;liver ailment&quot; (likely cirrhosis due to years of heavy drinking). She was 49. White was buried in Cimetière de Passy after a small, private funeral.

White left the majority of her fortune, including jewelry and property, to Theodore Cossika. She also bequeathed money to her father, nieces, and nephews, and her will provided $73,000 to charities.

== Legacy ==
Pearl White&#x27;s place in film history is important in both the evolution of cinema genres and the role of women. Like many silent films, many of White&#x27;s films are now considered lost. &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; only is known to exist in a reduced nine-reel version released in Europe in 1916, but &quot;The Exploits of Elaine&quot; survives in its entirety and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1994. In 2008, the condensed version of &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; was inducted into the Nation Film Registry. All of her films were made at studios on the East Coast because White reportedly never visited Hollywood. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Pearl White has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6838 Hollywood Blvd. The 1947 Paramount Pictures film &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, starring Betty Hutton, is a fictionalized biography of Pearl White.

<text>Michael Cormac Newell (born 28 March 1942) is an English film and television director and producer. He won the BAFTA for Best Direction for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994), which also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film, and directed the films &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (1997) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Newell was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, as the son of amateur actors, and was educated at St Albans School. He read English at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He then attended a three-year training course at Granada Television with the intention of entering the theatre.

==Career==
Newell directed various British TV shows from the 1960s onwards (such as &quot;Spindoe&quot;, credited as Cormac Newell, and &quot;Big Breadwinner Hog&quot;), but eventually shifted his focus to film direction.

His first feature-length project was &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1977), a made-for-television film. His first critically acclaimed movie was &quot;Bad Blood&quot; (1981), concerning the 1941 manhunt for the New Zealand mass-killer Stan Graham played by Jack Thompson. This was followed by &quot;Dance with a Stranger&quot; (1985), a biographical drama starring Miranda Richardson as Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in the UK. For his directorial efforts, Newell won the Award of the Youth at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.

Newell continued his successes in the film industry with &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1991), an adaptation of the 1922 novel by Elizabeth von Arnim. Miranda Richardson won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical and Joan Plowright won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.

During this period, George Lucas recruited Newell as one of the numerous feature film directors to direct episodes of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;.

The comedy &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994) was also critically acclaimed, winning numerous awards, including a César Award (Best Foreign Film), a Golden Globe (Best Actor – Hugh Grant), and a number of London Critics Circle Film Awards (Best Director, Film, Producer, and Screenwriter).

Since these award-winning productions, Newell has directed a number of films in Hollywood, such as &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (1997) (starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp), &quot;Pushing Tin&quot; (1999) (starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, and Angelina Jolie) and &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003) (starring Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, and Julia Stiles).

In 2005, Newell was presented with an honorary degree of Doctor of Arts by the University of Hertfordshire which has a campus in St Albans, his birthplace. He was also awarded the BAFTA Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing for his career prior to 2005. Newell became the first British director of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series with the production of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, the fourth adaptation in the series, which became a major critical and financial success worldwide. Newell is heard briefly as the radio announcer at the beginning of the film.

Newell directed &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; in 2010. In February 2011, Newell attended the British Academy Film Awards along with &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author J.K. Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson to collect the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Cinema on behalf of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

Continuing to work on adaptations, Newell directed &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (2012) from the novel by Charles Dickens with Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Jeremy Irvine in starring roles. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.

On Christmas Day in 2016, Newell appeared as a contestant on a special episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;University Challenge&quot;, representing his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Magdalene College, Cambridge.

<text>Peacefire was a U.S.-based website, with a registered address in Bellevue, Washington, dedicated to &quot;preserving First Amendment rights for Internet users, particularly those younger than 18&quot;. It was founded in August 1996 by Bennett Haselton, who still runs it. The site&#x27;s motto is, &quot;You&#x27;ll understand when you&#x27;re younger.&quot;

== History ==
==Activism==
Peacefire is primarily concerned with free speech rights and internet censorship, and providing information to the public about this. The authors on the site have been opponents of web content filtering and content-control software, which they refer to as &quot;censorware&quot;. They have offered information and tools for defeating several common web filters, which has been controversial.

From the website&#x27;s self-description in 2007:

The site has conducted long battles against the most commonly used filter programs, including, most famously, Net Nanny, CyberPatrol, and Bess. &quot;In particular, Peacefire has demonstrated that the filter programs suppress political speech and filter preferentially for corporate and conservative causes. In other cases, Peacefire has presented evidence that several filtering programs block some websites without having a human being review those sites first, despite the filtering companies&#x27; claims to the contrary. However, Peacefire is not usually active against filters that act in a more neutral way.

Along with publishing ways of bypassing these programs, Peacefire publishes criticism of them and information about their practices, such as SurfWatch blocking gay and lesbian websites and then unblocking them.

One common test that Peacefire runs is to create web pages filled with content clipped from news items. In particular, they will take quotes from conservative politicians that seem politically sensitive. They will then submit the site to a filter and see if it gets blocked. They will then point out that the content deemed &quot;inappropriate&quot; on their pages was, in fact, &quot;appropriate&quot; when coming from a corporate (or conservative blog) site. They also routinely search out sites of liberal and progressive content to see if they are blocked. They then compile a report to point out how the said software is discriminatory and restrictive of free speech/free access in what it censors. They offer these reports to the software makers and later follow up to see if any corrective measures have been taken.

The site is also involved in alerting the online community of efforts to pass laws restricting content to websites. Peacefire&#x27;s own website is often blocked, either in part or whole, by filtering software, and the organization has both sued and been threatened with lawsuits in civil court in the United States. Anyone of any age can become a member by signing up for the site&#x27;s low-volume, announcement-only electronic mailing list.

<text>Emerson Preparatory School (also known as Emerson) was a small private high school in Northwest Washington, D.C., founded in 1852 as the Emerson Institute. It was Washington&#x27;s oldest co-ed college preparatory school. The school closed at the end of the 2020-21 school year.

The school was located inside the Clocktower Building in Dupont Circle. Emerson had occupied that location since 2019, after moving from a temporary location in the Twelfth Street YMCA Building. Before 2017, Emerson spent eighty years in their own building across from the American Enterprise Institute. Most students used WMATA to get to and from school.

Emerson Preparatory School was a member of the Association of Independent Maryland and DC Schools (AIMS).

==History==
Emerson was founded in the District of Columbia in 1852 by Charles Bedford Young, Ph.D., as a school to prepare Washington area boys for entrance to Harvard. It was named for George Barrell Emerson, a noted New England educator, author, and Harvard graduate. After the Civil War the school&#x27;s graduates began to attend other colleges and universities, and, in 1920, Emerson became Washington&#x27;s first coeducational preparatory school.

Emerson&#x27;s school seal featured an image of the U.S. Capitol dome and the date 1852. The school mascot is the owl, symbolizing wisdom.

In the two years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, Emerson moved locations twice, later under the guidance of a new Head of School. Much of the teaching staff was let go as the school adopted an online model in response to the pandemic. The school closed at the end of the 2020-21 school year, stating that conditions were not conducive to operating Emerson in a financially sustainable manner.

==Staff and faculty==

John Julian Humphrey Sr. became principal of Emerson&#x27;s evening school in 1939, subsequently becoming headmaster at Emerson for 55 years, although his tenure was interrupted by World War Two. He also taught law, U.S. history and government, continuing to tutor students until his death.

A graduate of Emerson, Margot Walsh served as director of the school from 1999. She filled various roles at Emerson for almost 50 years, including as registrar.

==Student body==
During its early history, Emerson had sports and drama teams.

==Locations==

Emerson first opened at 914 14th Street Northwest Washington DC near Franklin Square between K and I Streets. In 1928, Emerson moved to a new building at 1740 P Street NW between Massachusetts and New Hampshire Avenues. In 1933, Emerson moved to 1525 16th Street NW near Stead Park between Q and Church Streets. In 1937, Emerson moved to 1324 18th Street NW near Dupont Circle between Massachusetts and Connecticut Avenues. In 2017, Emerson moved to a temporary location, the fourth floor of the Thurgood Marshall Center for Service and Heritage. In 2019, Emerson moved to the fourth floor of the Clocktower Building in Dupont Circle (1718 Connecticut Avenue NW).

<text>In the Marvel Universe, the Deviants are the end product of a series of DNA tests known as Homo descendus, created by the enigmatic alien Celestials. Their race is largely insensitive and they view all other species as a threat. They even distrust each other and often get in their own way.

==Publication history==
The Deviants first appeared in &quot;The Eternals&quot; #1 (July 1976).

==Fictional history==

They are an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth instigated by the alien Celestials, and wage war against their counterparts, the Eternals.

While the Eternals possess godlike power and are generally physically beautiful, the Deviants (who sometimes refer to themselves as &#x27;the Changing People&#x27;) are for the most part hideous, with each member of their race possessing some random physical or cosmetic mutation that is by Celestial design never repeated within the sub-species. Extremely mutated or deformed Deviants are referred to as &quot;mutates&quot; and some of the monsters of myth and legend have in fact been identified as Deviant mutates. Some of these mutations can provide superhuman abilities, but their powers are usually not as great as those of the Eternals.

According to the account of one Deviant in the 2006 comic book mini-series, the Deviants were created as a delicacy to be consumed &quot;en masse&quot; by Celestials at periodic intervals once they multiplied sufficiently. The veracity of this has been revealed untrue as the Deviants and the Eternals were actually created because the Celestials saw the human population as a useful pathogen to act as antibodies against the Horde, so the Deviants and the Eternals were to defend the process under the false impression that they were actually protecting the human race.

The Deviants are religious, revering the Dreaming Celestial (&quot;He Who Sleeps in Darkness&quot;). They credit him with their creation and claim that he granted them dominion over the Earth, an agreement they believe was later broken by the treachery of the other Celestials. They have one or more holy books—the only one named thus far being the &quot;Book of Krask&quot;.

The Deviants had already developed advanced technology such as genetic engineering when humans were still living in caves.

At some point in prehistoric times, some Deviants chased after Vnn and his lover Brrkk. When Brrkk died, Vnn found the corpse of a Tyrannosaurus that previously possessed the Star Brand. Vnn absorbed the Star Brand powers and used them to defeat the Deviants.

In the advent of the heroic age, Brother Tode was leading the Deviants, with his capital in the city of the Toads in the sunken continent of Lemuria. When the Fourth Celestial Host arrived on Earth, Deviants soldiers led by Warlord Kro attacked New York City in an attempt to provoke fear in the humans and trick them into attacking the Celestials. When this attempt failed, the Deviants sent an attack team to the Celestial spaceship, which failed too.

Later, the Deviants&#x27; aristocracy, led by Brother Tode, attacked Olympia and kidnapped the Eternals with the intent to disintegrate them. However, the hero Iron Man (James Rhodes) rescued the Eternals and helped them in the defeat of the Deviants. The Eternals transformed the Deviants&#x27; aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them. Only Warlord Kro escaped with the help of his old lover Thena of the Eternals.

Without the aristocracy, the Deviants&#x27; priests seized power, led by Priestlord Ghaur, who killed the son of Tode, Ranar. Kro returned to Lemuria and was crowned as a figurehead monarch, with the real power in the hands of Ghaur. With their new leader, the Deviants battled the Eternals again. Ghaur absorbed the power of the Dreaming Celestial and tried to ascend to godhood, but was defeated by the Eternals and the Avengers and was disintegrated. Kro was left as king of the Deviants.

Ghaur returned to corporeal form and tried to obtain the Serpent Crown with help of the Atlantean Lemurians, led by Llyra, in an attempt to invoke the Old God Set. The Avengers and Fantastic Four put an end to their mad plan and Ghaur was disintegrated once more. Without Ghaur, and with the abdication of Kro, the Deviants&#x27; society fall into anarchy and revolution. First, a warlord called Brutus tried to conquer the different races of the subterrain, but was killed when the Deviants discovered his &quot;mutate&quot; origin. Later Brother Visara led the Deviants in killing all the &quot;leaders&quot; and their followers. He was ultimately killed as well.

Later, Kro led a group of heroic Deviants, the Delta Network to rescue the Avengers from a resurrected Ghaur, who used his powers to control the Deviants once more. Ghaur (in a form of a giant statue) and the Deviants fought the Eternals and the Heroes for Hire, when the mad priest created an &quot;Anti-Mind&quot; in his plan to rule the world.

Kro and Ghaur formed bickering factions and kept the struggle for power for Deviant Lemuria. The external world did not know who was in charge. Ghaur risked a war with Wakanda after he discovered that his &quot;rejected&quot; (human-like) daughter was alive in that country. The Wakandan forces sieged Lemuria and the tension grew. Finally, the daughter was declared officially dead and Ghaur saved face.

Much later, the Deviant males were rendered sterile by a plague, the anarchy reigned, and a power contest between Ereshkigal and Ghaur happened. Ghaur won when he promised the Deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped Eternal Phastos and the Eternal&#x27;s resurrection machine. The Asgardian god Thor rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. When the Unbiding Stone (a doomsday artifact stolen by Erishkigal) was destroyed, Ghaur and Erishkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.

* Toxin – Member of the Underground Legion. His armor was destroyed by Tantalus. Toxin later allied himself with Tantalus against the Underground in hopes that he could rebuild his armor. However, he returned to Earth alongside the Peacekeepers.
* Wraath (William &quot;Willie&quot; Amos) – Member of the Peacekeepers. He is a cyborg who is possibly the future self of Mammoth.

===Delta Network===
The &quot;Delta Network&quot;, also referred to as the Delta Force (no relation to the real life Delta Force), was the name of a group of Deviants. The Delta Network was a group of Deviant warriors who were organized by Warlord Kro. When the Avengers were captured by the Deviant priesthood, Kro called the members into action to rescue them. Delta Network members included: Ransak the Reject, Karkas, Enigmo, and Donald and Deborah Ritter (the twin children of Thena and Kro). The Delta Network appeared only in &quot;Avengers&quot; #370–371. The group was created out of pre-existing characters by Glenn Herdling and Geof Isherwood.

===Skrulls===

The Skrulls are nearly all Deviants who eliminated the other offshoots of their species, leaving only one of the original race (Prime Skrull) and a Skrull Eternal (Kly&#x27;bn).

==In other media==
The Deviants made their film debut in &quot;Eternals&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Kro appears in the film as well, serving as the Deviants&#x27; leader. They are a monstrous race of near-immortal beings genetically engineered by the Celestials and are the historical enemies of the Eternals, their racial cousins. They were engineered to progress and ensure the development of life in the universe by wiping out apex predators on various planets, until they evolved to hunt down and wipe out all life, leading to the creation of the Eternals to stop them.

<text>The South Alberta Light Horse (SALH) is a Canadian Army armoured reconnaissance regiment of the Canadian Army Reserve. It traces its complicated lineage to the Rocky Mountain Rangers, and claims its direct ancestry to the 15th Light Horse, along with various other Alberta based cavalry units. The &quot;Light Horse&quot; designation comes from its light cavalry and mounted infantry origins.

The SALH is part of 41 Canadian Brigade Group of the 3rd Canadian Division, and is based in Medicine Hat, Edmonton and Lethbridge, Alberta.

==History==

===Early history===
The South Alberta Light Horse traces its beginnings to the period of the Riel Rebellion of 1885. During this conflict the Rocky Mountain Rangers (RMR) of Fort Macleod, which comprised 150 officers and men, were tasked with the protection of the area ranging from the U.S. border to the High River and from the Rockies to Medicine Hat. The RMR saw no action during their three months of existence during the rebellion, and the SALH carries the battle honour &quot;North West Canada, 1885&quot; on their colours.

This irregular light cavalry unit is seen as the true genesis of the regiment. The 15th Light Horse, the official direct ancestor of the SALH, was raised in Calgary on July 3, 1905. It consisted of four newly organized cavalry squadrons: Calgary (A Squadron), Fort MacLeod (B Squadron), High River (C Squadron), and Cochrane (D Squadron). From this point until the mid-1950s the regiment&#x27;s history can be described as a series of complicated amalgamations and redesignations of Alberta army reserve units of all arms until the regiment as it is now was formed in Calgary in 1954. At the beginning of the First World War, the Alberta militia units destined to become part of SALH were four cavalry regiments – 15th Light Horse in Calgary, 19th Alberta Dragoons in Edmonton, 21st Alberta Hussars in Medicine Hat and 23rd Alberta Rangers in Fort Macleod – and two infantry regiments (101st Regiment &quot;Edmonton Fusiliers&quot; and 103rd Regiment &quot;Calgary Rifles&quot;).

==== WWI and interregnum ====
In the First World War, instead of mobilising the Canadian militia to send overseas, new units were formed from volunteers of the militia and general public. The militia units generally became organizations for recruiting, induction and preliminary training for the new units. The 19th Alberta Dragoons recruited the 1st Divisional Cavalry Squadron, CEF, which landed in France in February 1915. After other divisions joined the 1st Canadian Division in France and the Canadian Corps was formed, the squadron was attached to the corps and became A Squadron, Canadian Light Horse, CEF. The troopers of this squadron wore 19th Alberta Dragoon badges throughout the war.Also recruited by SALH&#x27;s predecessors were three regiments of Canadian Mounted Rifles (CMR): the 3rd, 12th and 13th. The 3rd Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, CEF, was mobilized at Medicine Hat and landed in France in September 1915 as part of the 1st CMR Brigade. At the end of 1915, the CMR units in France were converted from two cavalry brigades (six regiments) into one infantry brigade (four battalions). The troopers of the 3rd Regiment were split up, half going to the 1st CMR Battalion and half to the 2nd CMR Battalion; both these battalions fought in the 3rd Canadian Division. The 12th and 13th Regiments CMR were broken up for reinforcements in England.

The SALH also counts a First World War artillery unit as an ancestor: 22nd (Howitzer) Battery, CFA, CEF. The battery landed in France on 19 January 1916, where it served as part of the 6th Brigade, 2nd Canadian Divisional Artillery until the end of the war. The battery was demobilized at Hamilton, 25 May 1919, and was disbanded on 1 November 1920. The battery is perpetuated by the 22nd Field Battery, RCA, Gleichen Alberta.

Of the eight infantry battalions recruited by the SALH&#x27;s predecessors, only one entered combat as a unit. The 31st Battalion, CEF, landed in France in September 1915 with the 2nd Canadian Division. It was awarded 22 battle honours, including such notable actions as Vimy and Passchendaele. The other seven battalions – 9th, 66th (Edmonton Guards), 113th Battalion (Lethbridge Highlanders), CEF, 138th (Edmonton), 175th (Medicine Hat), 187th (Central Alberta) and 202nd (Sportsman&#x27;s) – were broken up for reinforcements in England. 

The 31st Battalion (part of the 6th Infantry Brigade) participated in the first tank attack in history at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916, while A Squadron, Canadian Light Horse, made the last cavalry charge in Canadian history at the battle of Iwuy on 10 October 1918. This means that among the predecessor units of the SALH, one participated in the first military operation involving the tank and another mounted the last cavalry charge in Canadian history.

The period between the world wars saw two major reorganizations of the Canadian Militia, the first from 1920 to 1924 and the second from 1935 to 1936. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the ancestors of the SALH were two cavalry regiments (15th Alberta Light Horse in Calgary and 19th Alberta Dragoons in Edmonton) an independent artillery battery (22nd Field Battery, RCA, in Gleichen) and two infantry battalions (The Edmonton Fusiliers and the South Alberta Regiment in Medicine Hat).

===Second World War===

The 15th Alberta Light Horse contributed to several active service units, including the 31st (Alberta) Reconnaissance Regiment which remained in the Calgary area until the last year of the war. The South Alberta Regiment, recruited an active service battalion in the Medicine Hat area in the summer of 1940. This infantry unit trained in Canada until 1942 when it was reorganized as the 29th Armoured Regiment (The South Alberta Regiment) and moved to England in August. The SAR was granted 15 battle honours for its service overseas, redesignated the 29th Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (The South Alberta Regiment) in 1944. The unit was selected by Major-General F. F. Worthington to be the reconnaissance regiment of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division because he wanted &quot;keen-eyed prairie men&quot; as his scouts. The 29th was again converted, with all armoured reconnaissance regiments, to the war establishment of a regular armoured regiment in 1944 and sent to France in July of that year. It fought through Normandy, Belgium, the Scheldt, the Rhineland, the Netherlands and Germany until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945. 

The 22nd Field Battery became part of the 13th Field Regiment, which landed with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on D-Day at Juno Beach.

The Edmonton Fusiliers raised two active battalions, one for the 6th Canadian Infantry Division and one for the 8th Canadian Infantry Division. Both these divisions were home defence formations that did not go overseas.

Meanwhile, the 31st (Alberta) Reconnaissance Regiment had served in the Calgary area until January 1945 when it was shipped to England. It was disbanded a month later and broken up for reinforcements.

===Postwar===
The end of the war saw the re-emergence of The South Alberta Regiment (infantry) in Medicine Hat and the 15th Alberta Light Horse (armoured) in Calgary. The 15th however, was not to keep its name, and it was united with the 22nd Field Battery and renamed 68th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RCA. This remained until 1954 when it united with The South Alberta Regiment of Medicine Hat and the 41st Anti-Tank Regiment out of Calgary to become The South Alberta Light Horse (29th Armoured Regiment) out of Calgary. In 1958 &quot;29th Armoured Regiment&quot; was dropped from the name, and two years later, in 1960, the regiment was moved back to its old headquarters in Medicine Hat. The regiment remained an army reserve armoured unit until 1968 when it lost its tanks and was retasked as an armoured reconnaissance unit.

The two Edmonton units (19th Alberta Dragoons and The Edmonton Fusiliers) merged in 1946 as the 19th (Alberta) Armoured Car Regiment, RCAC. This regiment was renamed back to 19th Alberta Dragoons in 1958, but in the 1965 reorganization of the Reserves it was transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle: it still legally existed, but had no personnel assigned to it.

=== Recent history (1970–present) ===
In 1978 the SALH established an independent B Squadron in Edmonton to train out of Griesbach Barracks, and was originally organized as a reconnaissance unit. Though later, B Squadron transitioned to AVGP and was redesignated as armoured squadron in the early 1980s. In line with this change, the rest of the regiment followed suit and by 1985 the entire regiment returned to being an armoured regiment.

In 2005, the AVGP Cougar was retired from service, and the SALH reroled back to Armoured Reconnaissance, equipped with the Mercedes-Benz G Wagon - Light Utility Vehicle Wheeled (LUVW). 

The regiment exercised its Freedom of the City of Medicine Hat In 2006, the SALH formally amalgamated with the nil-strength 19th Alberta Dragoons, a regiment that had been on the Supplementary Order of Battle since 1965, and now officially maintains the battle honours and traditions of its Edmonton predecessors.

In the Spring of 2015, the regiment sought and received permission to detach 3 Troop, A Squadron from Medicine Hat to Lethbridge, as recruiting in the Lethbridge region had been successful enough to support several troopers travelling to Medicine Hat on a weekly basis for training. As this group grew, it became possible to detach 3 Troop to its own lines co-located with the 20th Independent Field Battery, RCA, at the Vimy Ridge Armoury in Lethbridge.

The regiment is presently training with the new Textron Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle, which was delivered to 3rd Canadian Division units in the Spring to Summer of 2017.

<text>Mary Cholmondeley ( ; 8 June 1859 – 15 July 1925) was an English novelist. Her bestseller &quot;Red Pottage&quot; satirised religious hypocrisy and the narrowness of country life. It was adapted as a silent film in 1918.

==Family==
Mary Cholmondeley was born at Hodnet near Market Drayton in Shropshire, the third of eight children of Rev Richard Hugh Cholmondeley (1827–1910) and his wife Emily Beaumont (1831–1893). Her great-uncle was a hymn-writing bishop, Reginald Heber, and her niece a writer, Stella Benson. An uncle, Reginald Cholmondeley of Condover Hall, was a host of the American novelist Mark Twain on his visits to England. Her sister Hester, who died in 1892, wrote poetry and kept a journal: selections appear in Mary&#x27;s family memoir, &quot;Under One Roof&quot; (1918).

After brief periods in Farnborough, Warwickshire and Leaton, Shropshire, the family returned to Hodnet when her father took over from his father as rector in 1874. Much of the first 30 years of her life passed in helping her sickly mother to run the household and her father to do his parish work, although she herself suffered from asthma. She entertained her brothers and sisters with stories from an early age.

After her father retired in 1896, she moved with him and her sister Diana to Condover Hall, which he had inherited from Reginald. They sold it and moved to Albert Gate Mansions in Knightsbridge, London. After her father died, she lived with her sister Victoria, moving between Ufford, Suffolk, and 2 Leonard Place, Kensington. During the war she did clerical work at the Carlton House Terrace Hospital. The sisters moved in 1919 to 4 Argyll Road, Kensington, where Mary died unmarried on 15 July 1925, aged 66.

==Writings==

Cholmondeley began writing with serious intent in her teens. She wrote in her journal in 1877, &quot;What a pleasure and interest it would be to me in life to write books. I must strike out a line of some kind, and if I do not marry (for at best that is hardly likely, as I possess neither beauty nor charms) I should want some definite occupation, besides the home duties.&quot; She placed initially some stories in &quot;The Graphic&quot; and elsewhere. Her first novel was &quot;The Danvers Jewels&quot; (1887), a detective story that won a small following. It appeared in the &quot;Temple Bar&quot; magazine published by Richard Bentley, after fellow novelist Rhoda Broughton had introduced her to George Bentley. It was followed by &quot;Sir Charles Danvers&quot; (1889), &quot;Diana Tempest&quot; (1893) and &quot;A Devotee&quot; (1897). Bentley paid £40 for &quot;The Danvers Jewels&quot; and £50 for &quot;Sir Charles Danvers&quot;, both in two volumes, but increased an offer of £250 for the three-volume &quot;Diana Tempest&quot; to £400, the first of her books to appear under her name.

The satirical &quot;Red Pottage&quot; (1899) sold well both sides of the Atlantic and is still reprinted. It satirises religious hypocrisy and the narrowness of country life, but was denounced from a London pulpit as immoral. It was equally sensational when exploring &quot;the issues of female sexuality and vocation&quot;, recurring topics in late Victorian debates about the New Women. Despite the book&#x27;s great success, however, the author received little money for it later as she had sold the copyright. A silent film, &quot;Red Pottage&quot;, was made in 1918.

&quot;Diana Tempest&quot; was reissued in 2009 for the first time in a century.

Later works such as &quot;Moth and Rust&quot; (1902) and &quot;Notwithstanding&quot; (1913) were less successful. &quot;The Lowest Rung&quot; (1908) and &quot;The Romance of his Life&quot; (1921) were story collections. The latter, her final book, was dedicated to the essayist and critic Percy Lubbock. Lubbock later commemorated her in &quot;Mary Cholmondeley: A Sketch from Memory&quot; (1928).

<text>Spiderland is the second and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was released by Touch and Go Records on March 27, 1991. Slint&#x27;s lineup at the time of recording comprised Brian McMahan on vocals and guitar, David Pajo on guitar, Todd Brashear on bass guitar and Britt Walford on drums. &quot;Spiderland&quot; was engineered by Brian Paulson and recorded over four days in August 1990. The music and vocal melodies were composed throughout the summer of 1990, while lyrics were written in-studio.

Forming in 1986 in Louisville, Kentucky, Slint had met as teenagers playing in the Midwestern punk scene but soon diverged sonically from their hardcore punk roots. By the time they recorded &quot;Spiderland&quot; in mid-1990, the band had developed a complex, idiosyncratic sound characterized by atypical rhythmic meters, harmonic dissonance and irregular song structures. McMahan&#x27;s vocal delivery on the record alternates between spoken word, singing and shouting. The lyrics are presented in a narrative style and cover themes such as unease, social anxiety, loneliness, and despair.

Slint broke up shortly before the album&#x27;s release due to McMahan&#x27;s depression. In the US, &quot;Spiderland&quot; initially attracted little critical attention and sold poorly. However, a warm reception from UK music papers and gradually increasing sales in subsequent years helped it develop a significant cult following. &quot;Spiderland&quot; is widely regarded as foundational to the 1990s post-rock and math rock movements, and is cited by critics as a milestone of indie and experimental rock, inspiring myriad subsequent artists. Slint reunited in 2005 to perform the album in its entirety across three international tours.

== Background ==

Slint formed in 1986 in Louisville, Kentucky, after the dissolution of two local bands: Squirrel Bait and Maurice. The founding members included David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums) and Ethan Buckler (bass guitar), with Brian McMahan (guitar, vocals) joining soon after their first performance. Their debut album &quot;Tweez&quot; was recorded by Steve Albini and released in 1989 on the group&#x27;s self-owned record label Jennifer Hartman Records and Tapes. Buckler left the band out of dissatisfaction with &quot;Tweez&quot;, and was replaced with Todd Brashear. Their second recording was an untitled extended play (EP) commonly referred to as &quot;Slint&quot;. Its instrumental rock sound featured on the EP, which would not be released until 1994, reflected both their new direction and increased musical sophistication since writing and recording their debut album.

The 1989 studio recordings drew the attention of Corey Rusk, co-founder of Touch and Go Records. He said that the album &quot;was just so radically different than &quot;Tweez&quot;. ... I remember getting a tape of that and just listening to it over and over, really fucking loud.&quot; By early 1990, Rusk had agreed to pay for studio time and committed to a release their next record with Touch and Go. In July 1989, two weeks after the release of &quot;Tweez&quot;, Slint supported concerts by Crain and King Kong at which they debuted early versions of the songs: &quot;Nosferatu Man&quot;, &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; and &quot;Washer&quot;. That June, they performed nearly finalized instrumental renditions of the &quot;Spiderland&quot; songs during a concert at the Kentucky Theater.

==Production and recording==
Throughout the summer of 1990, the band practiced the music for six new songs McMahan and Walford had written for Slint&#x27;s second album. The songs were recorded in August 1990 with producer Brian Paulson, who was known for his &quot;live&quot; recording style and minimal takes. Paulson later said that the recording &quot;was weird... because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there was something about it. I&#x27;ve never heard anything like this.&quot; McMahan and Walford wrote the lyrics at the last minute while in studio, although they had worked out the vocal melodies in advance using recordings of practice sessions and a four-track. The album mostly explored themes of coming of age and anxiety about the approach of adulthood, and McMahan did not want the lyrics or vocal style to be heard by others until the actual recordings. He said: &quot;I did not want to rehearse the vocals...it was a one-shot, cathartic experience.&quot;

The recording sessions were intense, fraught, and often difficult. According to AllMusic, they were &quot;traumatic...and one more piece of evidence supporting the theory that band members had to be periodically institutionalized during the completion of the album.&quot; Rumors circulated that at least one member of Slint had checked into a psychiatric hospital. Walford later said that there was no truth to such claims, although the band was &quot;definitely trying to be serious about things, pretty intense, which made recording the album kinda stressful.&quot; The recording was completed in four days.

== Music ==

The album&#x27;s guitar work is noted for its roomy sound, angular rhythms, dramatically alternating dynamic shifts, and irregular time signatures. McMahan&#x27;s singing style varies among mumbling, spoken word, strained shouting, and a written-narrative style. Will Hermes of &quot;Spin&quot; summarized the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;mid-&#x27;70s King Crimson gone emo: screeching guitar chords and gorgeous note-spinning in odd-metered instrumentals speckled with words both spoken and sung&quot;. Steve Albini, writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, described the music as &quot;structurally and in tone&quot;, saying that the band &quot;recall[s] Television circa &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; and Crazy Horse, whose simplicity they echo and whose style they most certainly do not&quot;.

The lyrics are usually narrative in style, and have been described as &quot;eerie&quot; and having &quot;peculiar syntax&quot;. Both the vocal melodies and words were written by McMahan and Walford after the basic tracks had been recorded during practice sessions, and often were not heard by Pajo and Brashear until their final recording in studio. The vocal additions often pulled the songs in new directions, with examples being &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; and &quot;Washer&quot;. McMahan was never comfortable taking the role of vocalist and only did so because nobody else in the band would. He considerably increases his range on &quot;Spiderland&quot;, incorporating both his earlier whispered and shouting approaches with what Tennent describes as conventional, &quot;actual singing&quot;.

The opening track, &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot;, describes a day at a carnival with a fortune-teller. The song is built from complex guitar arrangement with sharp transitions, during which the guitar fluctuates between a clean-sounding riff with harmonics in the verse to heavy and high pitched distortion in the chorus. &quot;Nosferatu Man&quot; is the second track and was inspired by the 1922 German Expressionist silent film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. Its verse includes a dissonant guitar riff which uses high-pitched notes similar to those in &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot; and a drumbeat centered on snare and toms. The chorus, featuring &quot;jagged&quot; distorted guitar and a beat with &quot;thrashing cymbals with quick drum fills&quot;, segues into an extended groove before the song ends with 30 seconds of feedback.

Walford sings and plays lead guitar on &quot;Don, Aman&quot;, a deliberate anagram of Madonna. Delivered in a hushed tone, the song&#x27;s ambiguous lyrics depict the thoughts of an &quot;isolated soul&quot; before, during, and after an evening at a bar. The tempo quickens as the song develops, becoming loud and distorted at its peak, before slowing back to the original speed. &quot;Washer&quot; is the album&#x27;s longest track, and features a low volume intro with guitar and cymbals before the rest of the band joins in the recording. The song builds until the final verse, when the tension is broken by loud distortion, followed by a lengthy outro. Pajo has said he is particularly proud of the song&#x27;s one-note guitar solo, admitting that &quot;at that point in my life, if someone asked me to do a solo, I would do the exact opposite of what a solo usually is. Instead of playing a bunch of notes, I would just play one, though I did some decorative stuff around it there. There’re some cool, weird things in that song&quot;.

The instrumental &quot;For Dinner...&quot; begins with a quiet section of &quot;brooding chords throb[bing] with the occasional rumble of muted toms and bass drum&quot;, the song cycles through sections of building and releasing tension. The guitars employ standard tuning, and do not use effects pedals. The closing song, &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot;, has been described as a tribute to the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; but the band have denied this. The song, which Pajo says is his favorite from the album, is built from a two-chord guitar structure, described as a &quot;spindly, tight riff&quot;, and a &quot;jerky&quot; drumbeat. During the recording of the final chorus, McMahan became physically sick due to the strain of yelling over the guitars. David Peschek of &quot;The Guardian&quot; compared &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; to Led Zeppelin for its epic scope, though not its bleak mood, writing: &quot;the extraordinary [song] is [Slint&#x27;s] &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, if it&#x27;s possible to imagine Stairway to Heaven bleached of all bombast.&quot;

== Title and packaging ==
The title originates from McMahan&#x27;s younger brother, who thought the record sounded &quot;spidery&quot;. Its black-and-white cover photograph depicts the band members treading water in the lake of an abandoned quarry in Utica, Indiana. The photograph was taken by the musician Will Oldham, who was friends with the band and whose father had taken the photograph on the cover of &quot;Tweez&quot;. &quot;The Stranger&quot; credits the image as responsible for the later mystique surrounding the publicity-shy band, and notes how &quot;most people only had seen Slint as four heads floating in a Kentucky quarry on &quot;Spiderland&quot;″s cover. Listeners pondered the band&#x27;s sparsely adorned black-and-white covers as if they were ruins bearing secrets.&quot;

Chris Gaerig of the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot; wrote that the album cover &quot;captures the joyous fear and violence of the album so precisely it shakes souls. The group—submerged in a lake to their chins with deranged smiles—seems to be stalking you, hovering out of the black-and-white façade.&quot; Several other promotional images have been taken from the same photo session with Oldham.

The photograph on the back cover is of a dead wolf spider, taken by Noel Saltzman, who also took the uncredited cover photo for their untitled 1994 EP. Saltzman found the spider in a shed while working his summer job. As it would not remain still enough to be photographed, Saltzman killed, froze, and repositioned it with tweezers to take the shot. The inside sleeve contains the message &quot;interested female vocalists write 1864 douglas blvd. louisville, ky. 40205&quot;. The words &quot;this recording is meant to be listened to on vinyl&quot; is printed on some CD issues, indicating Slint&#x27;s preference for analog audio devices.

== Reception ==
The band had broken up by the time Touch and Go were preparing for the album&#x27;s release. As a result, a planned tour of Europe was canceled and the album received minimal promotion. It thus failed to attract an audience, make an impression on college radio, or chart in either the US or the UK. The album went virtually unnoticed by the American music press or zines. &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; described it as &quot;genius&quot;, but only during a passing mention midway through a column on the Kentucky scene. The writer for &quot;Flipside&quot; was unable to review the album as he had received a damaged copy from the label, and did not ask to have it replaced. McMahan admits that while the band did not seek to engage with journalists, &quot;there wasn&#x27;t really a huge infrastructure for getting information out on a broad scale. We definitely avoided it.&quot;

The UK music press were the first to report on the album. Edwin Pouncey reviewed it in the March 23, 1991 issue of &quot;NME&quot;, finding its sound indebted to Sonic Youth but concluding that &quot;something original squirms at the core of Slint. Perhaps next time they&#x27;ll reveal all.&quot; Albini, who produced &quot;Tweez&quot;, wrote a review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; published the following week. He praised the music&#x27;s originality and emotional intensity, as well as the clarity and immediacy of Paulson&#x27;s production. He claimed that &quot;Tweez&quot;—which he produced—only &quot;hints at their genius&quot; but had little of the &quot;staying power&quot; manifested on &quot;Spiderland&quot;. He awarded the album &quot;ten fucking stars&quot; and predicted that it would rise in stature, writing &quot;It&#x27;s an amazing record... and no one still capable of being moved by rock music should miss it. In 10 years it will be a landmark and you&#x27;ll have to scramble to buy a copy then.&quot;

The album sold only a few thousand copies within the first year. Even a few years later it was estimated to have sold fewer than 5,000 copies. Slint remained an obscure local act in the period leading up to the album&#x27;s release. By the time it came out, the band had already broken up and its members had moved on to new projects, believing that Slint would be &quot;just another blip&quot;.

In the February issue of &quot;Select&quot;, reviewer Mike Noon praised its &quot;creeping success&quot;, but cautioned that the band&#x27;s sound would take time to fully appreciate. In September 1992, Ben Thompson reviewed both &quot;Spiderland&quot; and &quot;Tweez&quot; for &quot;The Wire&quot;, and while the band&#x27;s reputation had grown by that time, wrote that bands &quot;like Pavement&quot; were &quot;hailing them as guiding lights for a new obliqueness&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s not surprising these records confused people on first release&quot;, he wrote, in part because listeners had been primed to expect straightforward noise rock—a &quot;total red herring&quot; that concealed the band&#x27;s &quot;alarmingly introverted&quot; sound. Thompson found &quot;Spiderland&quot; accessible but wrote that it &quot;demands that you push your head up right close to the speakers (or buy some headphones) if you want to find out what is being said and sung.&quot; According to biographer Scott Tennent, the laudatory review of the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; failed to attract commercial interest, but over the years succeeded in rescuing the album from an otherwise-assured relegation to obscurity.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Spiderland&quot; is considered a major influence on the post-rock bands Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Isis and Explosions in the Sky. Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh said the album was &quot;quiet-to-loud&quot; while still sounding like nothing before, as if &quot;a new kind of music.&quot; Mogwai&#x27;s Stuart Braithwaite was struck by the &quot;psychic playing&quot; evident on &quot;Spiderland&quot;, stating &quot;when I heard it, it was unlike anything I’d heard before. I still don’t know if I have heard anything else like it, now. Obviously a lot of bands take a lot from it – I know that we did.&quot; PJ Harvey included &quot;Spiderland&quot; in her 1992 &quot;Ten For Today&quot; list of records, while Bob Nastanovich of Pavement ranked it as among his favorite albums.

Its cover was recreated by The Shins in the music video for &quot;New Slang&quot;. The album is regarded as essential to &quot;the fabric of math-rock genre&quot;. Peschek described it as &quot;the ur-text for what became known as post-rock, a fractured, almost geometric reimagining of rock music stripped of its dionysiac impulse.&quot; Rachel Devine of &quot;The List&quot; called &quot;Spiderland&quot; &quot;arguably the most disproportionately influential [album] in music history&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Stuart Berman noted how the album &quot;motivated a cluster of semi-popular bands in the late-90s and early 2000s to adopt its whisper-to-scream schematic. It&#x27;s the boundless inspiration it perpetually provides for all the bands that have yet to emerge from the basement.&quot; In 2015, &quot;Gigwise&quot; named the album in their list of &quot;The 11 most vicious post-hardcore albums ever.&quot;

In the 2010s AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming described it as one of the most singular and important albums of the &#x27;90s, and in 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the twelfth best album of the 1990s. Fact magazine would also rate it the third best album of the 1990s. In 2024, &quot;The Independent&quot; ranked it number five on their list of the 20 most underrated albums ever. Writing in 2000, Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, and said that despite their &quot;sad-sack affect&quot;, Slint are actually &quot;art-rockers without the courage of their pretensions&quot;, and noted that the lyrics were not to his liking. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, journalist Mac Randall felt even though it is more accessible than &quot;Tweez&quot;, &quot;[t]he absence of anything resembling a tune continues to nag&quot;. Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk observed how &quot;Spiderland&quot; is &quot;like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn&#x27;t sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it&#x27;s one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on.&quot;

=== Reunions ===
After Slint&#x27;s break-up in November 1990, the members went on to play in other projects, notably Tortoise, The Breeders, Palace and The For Carnation. They reunited briefly in 2005 for an eighteen-date tour. Pajo said that they didn&#x27;t &quot;want to be a reunion band that keeps reuniting. ... I know that this is going to be it.&quot; Their 2007 performance of the album at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; concert series celebrating classic albums lead to a tour that included an appearance at the 2007 Pitchfork Music Festival and Primavera Sound festival.

Critics differed in their assessment of the reunion. Some viewed the band&#x27;s studio-based music as fundamentally unsuited to a live setting. Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that although &quot;fans greeted [Slint&#x27;s performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival] as manna from heaven. [...] the musicians&#x27; fragile, intertwining guitar lines, mumbled attempts at poetry and uninspiring shoegazer personas were poor matches for the setting and the occasion.&quot; Both DeRogatis and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that the band&#x27;s performance was plagued by sound problems. According to &quot;Vulture&quot; reviewer Nick Catucci, their &quot;deeply brooding, fussily-executed album finally sounded, sixteen years later...like the existential, cosmos-annihilating shrug it was envisioned as. Which is to say: It sounded fucking great.&quot;

==Remastered box set==


In 2014, Touch and Go reissued &quot;Tweez&quot; and a version of &quot;Spiderland&quot; remastered by Bob Weston from the original analog master-tapes. The bonus tracks were selected by the band and include demos, outtakes and a live performance. The transitional songs (written after &quot;Tweez&quot;, but before the bulk of the &quot;Spiderland&quot; tracks) &quot;Pam&quot; and &quot;Glenn&quot; (whose recording is described as containing one the best drum sounds Albini ever achieved) were recorded during the &quot;Spiderland&quot; sessions but failed to make the album.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Slint, except track 3 which was exclusively written by Britt Walford.


== Personnel ==
The album packaging omitted the band members&#x27; names. The lineup credits below are adapted from &quot;The Great Alternative &amp; Indie Discography&quot; (1999) by Martin C. Strong. Walford performed vocals and guitar on &quot;Don, Aman&quot;, accompanied by Pajo on guitar.

<doc id="811486" wikidata="Q3234684" url="?curid=811486" title="The Elfstones of Shannara">
<text>The Elfstones of Shannara is a 1982 epic fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks. It is the first sequel to &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; and the second book in &quot;The Original Shannara Trilogy&quot;. It expands upon the history of the Elves, which was only hinted at in the preceding story, and follows Wil Ohmsford, grandson of Shea (the hero of the first book) and inheritor of the Shannara Elfstones.

The novel, set in a fictional world called the Four Lands, consists of two intertwining plotlines. The first plotline follows the quest of protagonists Wil Ohmsford and Amberle Elessedil to create a new Ellcrys, a magical tree that serves to banish all Demons from the Four Lands. To do this, they must locate a specific place in the Four Lands called Safehold, where the process of creating a new Ellcrys can begin. The second plotline focuses on the efforts of the Elven army and their allies to slow a massive Demon invasion, made possible by the dying of the current Ellcrys, to give Wil and Amberle enough time to complete their quest.

== Background ==
After Terry Brooks had completed all work on his first novel, &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, in fall 1975—having begun it in 1967—he began work on another book soon after. The plot he originally chose featured the son of Menion Leah as the protagonist and a girl with a Siren-like song that could manipulate the properties of objects around her. Brooks outlined about three-quarters of the story before beginning to write; he refused an attempt by Lester del Rey to see it because Brooks wanted to impress the editor. When Brooks finished three-quarters of the tale in fall 1977 after writing around his law practice hours, he found himself stuck and could not think of a suitable ending. He decided to send the story to del Rey to get his opinion on what the end should be. The reply he received was quite unexpected; del Rey firmly believed that Brooks needed to simply get rid of the started novel and start anew due to a plethora of problems he saw. Once del Rey finished a full line-by-line examination of the plot, Brooks leafed through the comments and found them to be disturbingly accurate.

So, Brooks started over. This time, he created an outline for the full story and mailed it to del Rey and his wife for comments prior to delving into the writing process once more. In his frustration about the old story, though, he decided to forget about his former protagonist—even that character&#x27;s entire generation. Instead, he gave the protagonist role to the grandson of the hero in &quot;Sword&quot;, Wil Ohmsford. In place of the siren-oriented tale, he took on the history of the Elves. del Rey approved this new plan, and Brooks began weaving the tale in late 1978. He finished it in late 1980 and sent it off to del Rey. He replied in February 1981 with 25 single-spaced pages-worth of errors or problems, including a roughly 200-page span where he felt that the action and dialogue was seen from the author&#x27;s viewpoint—not a character&#x27;s. To address this, Brooks used Ander Elessedil, formerly a minor character with little impact on the plot, and turned him into the focus of a majority of the book. Four months later, he sent the story out once again. This time it only required minor alterations.

== Plot ==

=== History ===
Before the dawn of mankind was the age of Faerie, an era from which many powerful spirits (such as the King of the Silver River) came. The Elves, extremely long-lived and possessing great magic, created the Elfstones. As a necessary balance to the light, darkness was also created in the beginning of time; from this darkness the Demons were born. After years of battle between the light and the dark, the Elves summoned their greatest magic and created the Forbidding, a spell that imprisoned the Demons beyond the confines of the world. They also created the Ellcrys, a beautiful silver tree with crimson leaves to maintain the Forbidding. Unfortunately, this drained nearly all the strength of the Elves, leaving them with very little magic. Most of the creatures of Faerie died out in this period of waning magic; yet the Elves survived, though diminished in splendor. In time, they came to resemble more and more the human race that had recently evolved, both in strength and longevity. Afraid of the rapidly multiplying humans, Elves went into hiding, remaining one with nature, ever guarding the Ellcrys. Even when mankind nearly destroyed the world in the Great Wars, the Elves lived on, spending their last remaining magic to save the Ellcrys. In the aftermath of the destruction, as mankind split into &quot;four&quot; distinct races, the Elves took that opportunity to come out from hiding. Indeed, most believed that the Elves were just another offshoot of mankind, like the Dwarves, Gnomes and Trolls. The Elves emerged as leaders in the new world; it was the Elf Galaphile who summoned the first Druid council at Paranor.

=== Present ===
The magical Ellcrys tree was beginning to die, thus weakening the spell that held the Forbidding. The Ellcrys spoke to the Chosen, telling them of a rebirth, a process which enables a new tree to be born—but this can only be done at the fountain of the Bloodfire. The Chosen then inform their Prince Ander Elessedil and King Eventine Elessedil of the matter. However, no one knows of the location of the Bloodfire. A search in the ancient Elven library reveals one reference to the Bloodfire. It states that it lies in a place named &quot;Safehold&quot;. At the same time, a powerful Demon, the Dagda Mor, escapes from the waning Forbidding, bringing with it two other demons named the Reaper and the Changeling. The Dagda Mor then sends the Reaper to kill all the Chosen, and the Changeling to act as a spy for the demons within the Elven city. Eventine finds himself at a loss, for only the Chosen can make the rebirth of the Ellcrys happen.

The Druid Allanon appeared, telling Eventine that his coming must remain a secret, and promising to find out the location of Safehold. He went to the ancient Druid keep, Paranor, in an attempt to locate Safehold. After learning its location, Allanon was ambushed by the Dagda Mor and a handful of Furies.

He retreated to Storlock for a time, and then went to Havenstead with Wil Ohmsford—who is a Healer, a descendant of Jerle Shannara and bearer of the Elfstones—to find Amberle Elessedil, who is King Eventine&#x27;s granddaughter and a Chosen, who abandoned her duty to the Ellcrys and fled the Elven capital, Arborlon. She eventually agreed to return to Arborlon with them, only giving in when Demon Wolves were closing in upon them.

En route, close to the Silver River, Allanon, Amberle and Wil were ambushed by Demon wolves. Allanon fended off the Demons while Wil and Amberle escaped to safety. The King of the Silver River took them in and sheltered them just before they would have been caught; after talking with him, the duo discover they have been transported miles away from where they started, and have no idea if Allanon survived or where he was. They decided to continue on to Arborlon and hoped to meet him there, but on the way their horse was stolen by Rovers, a group of people who travel in caravans and recognize no laws but their own. Wil insisted that they get the horse back, and ingratiated himself to the Rovers and their leader Cephelo by using his skills as healer to help some of the sick or mildly injured members of the family. He met Eretria, a beautiful Rover girl Cephelo said was his daughter; in reality, she was not his daughter at all and would be sold now that she was of an age to marry. She was immediately attracted to Wil and wanted to help him get the horse back, if he promised to take her with him when he escaped. A giant demon attacked the caravan and Wil was forced to use the Elfstones to defend the Rovers, finally destroying the demon, but damaging himself somehow in a way he did not understand. Cephelo was angry with him, but let him and Amberle leave with their horse. Eretria was left behind but promised to Wil that they would meet again. After being pursued by demons, Wil and Amberle managed to regroup with Allanon and return to Arborlon. Amberle received a seed from the dying Ellcrys and prepared to go to Safehold with Wil, six Elven companions and the Captain of the Home Guard, Crispin.

After they journeyed by boat to the Elven outpost at Drey Wood, the group found the entire garrison that had been stationed at the outpost dead—and the Reaper, who had killed all of them. They managed to escape by setting off down the river once more, but two of the Elven guards were run down and killed in the process. Wil realized that there must have been a spy in Arborlon, and that if the spy knew about Drey Wood, then it was likely their mission was known and they would be pursued the entire way. The party then goes to the Matted Brakes, where another two of the group are killed by an unknown massive creature. After escaping from the Brakes, the remaining group of five found themselves at an ancient Elven fortress named Pykon. The group made the decision to rest the night there, but the Reaper found them again and killed the final two Elven hunters. Wil and Amberle ran into the network of tunnels inside of the Pykon to try to find Crispin, who had gone into there to try to find a way out. Wil and Amberle finally lost the Reaper by destroying a bridge over a gorge, but they lost Crispin as well. During the battle, Wil failed to unlock the power of the Elfstones and believed that his human blood was blocking him from using them. He was resigned to not being able to use the stones anymore, and decided that they would just have to get along without them. The duo met the young Wing Rider Perk soon after, who agreed to take them into the Wilderun on his Roc, Genewen. He also agreed to fly over the Hollows every day for a week in case the duo had need of his help.

Meanwhile, Allanon and the Elves went to war with the Demons, beginning the War of the Forbidding. The Elven army took up two positions in two mountain passes named Halys Cut and Worl Run. Having no weapons, the Demons used human-wave tactics in the ensuing battles and literally ran over the Elven army, even managing to injure King Eventine. Ander&#x27;s older brother, Arion Elessedil, was killed as well in Worl Run. Defeated, the Elven force retreated first to Baen Draw, successfully defending it until it was discovered that they were being flanked. They then retreated to Arborlon, their last line of defense. In the process, they lost their commander, Kael Pindanon. Shortly after their return to Arborlon, Dwarf and Troll contingents joined them, uniting banners from all four of the Four Lands for the first time in history. Eventine was recovering in his room when the Changeling, disguised for months as Eventine&#x27;s pet dog Manx, tried to kill the old king in his bed. Eventine killed the Demon, but was badly wounded and near death.

Amberle and Wil traveled to Grimpen Ward, a town of thieves and cutthroats in the Wilderun. Wil caused a stir by healing an old innkeeper woman and jokingly claiming he did it with magic. Thieves try to rob him and Amberle, but they were rescued by Cephelo and Eretria. Wil told Cephelo of his need to go to the Hollows, claiming it was for a rare medicine for Eventine&#x27;s granddaughter. Cephelo takes them to Hebel, an old hermit who lives in the Wilderun. Hebel recognized the name Safehold and knew where it was; under a lonely mountain in the hollows, the domain of the Witch Sisters. Wil and Amberle went on despite Hebel&#x27;s warnings, after parting ways with the Rovers. They soon found out that the Elfstones were stolen by Cephelo, and that he had wanted them ever since he had seen Wil use them on the demon that attacked the caravan. Wil left Amberle at the edge of the Hollows and pursued Cephelo. Eretria once again helped Wil to locate Cephelo, only to find that he and the rest of his followers were killed by the Reaper. Wil regained the Elfstones and traveled back to the rim of the Hollows with Eretria. He found Amberle missing. Hebel appeared and agreed to track Amberle for Wil. Together with Hebel&#x27;s dog, Drifter, they tracked Amberle to the witch Mallenroh&#x27;s tower. Mallenroh captured them and decided to keep the Elfstones for herself, locking up Wil and the rest as prisoners until Wil agreed to give her the stones.

Mallenroh&#x27;s identical twin sister Morag arrived, and the Witch Sisters fought and killed each other. Wil, Eretria, Hebel, and Drifter escaped with Amberle, the Elfstones, and Mallenroh&#x27;s servant, Wisp; who brought them to the Bloodfire. Amberle both absorbed the Bloodfire and bathed the seed of the Ellcrys in it. The Reaper attacked them and killed Wisp, but Wil destroyed it by realizing that it wasn&#x27;t his human blood preventing the use of the Elfstones, but because he was afraid of them and had formed a mental block against using them. He broke the block, focusing the power of the Elfstones upon the Reaper&#x27;s cloaked face and destroying it. Wil had Eretria call Perk, who brought Wil, Amberle and Eretria back to Arborlon while Hebel returned home.

By this point, the Demons had begun a full frontal assault upon Arborlon. Despite desperate attempts to blunt the attacks, the seven gates fell one by one to the superior numbers of the Demons. The Demons eventually broke through the last of the Elven capital&#x27;s major defenses (the seventh gate). At this point, Allanon engaged and defeated the Dagda Mor in a titanic battle while the forces of &quot;good&quot;, now severely depleted, regrouped at their last line of defense: the Gardens of Life, where the Ellcrys resided. The Demons tried to reach the Ellcrys to destroy her, but they were held back by those forces of &quot;good&quot; just long enough so that Wil and Amberle could fly in. Amberle touched the dead Ellcrys and was transformed into the new Ellcrys; and with this action, Amberle restored the Forbidding, banishing the Demons back to their alternate universe. It was revealed by Allanon to Wil that he knew all along that Amberle would become the new Ellcrys. Wil was angry and told Allanon he should have been honest, but Allanon claimed that she would not have believed him. He reminds Wil that Amberle knew what would happen and made the choice herself, and that no one forced her. She did what only she could do, and in so doing saved humanity from the Demons. Wil was still bitter about the deception, because he had loved Amberle and didn&#x27;t want to lose her the way he had. It is then revealed that Allanon has aged, because he used too much of the magic in the fighting with the Demons. He said he was going to Paranor to sleep, and then left in the middle of the night without seeing or speaking with anyone else.

Eventine died, and Ander became the new King. With the Demons banished once again, the survivors of the war returned to their homes. Wil visited the Ellcrys and came to terms with Amberle&#x27;s sacrifice. He then left Arborlon to continue his studies as a healer, taking Eretria with him.

== Television adaptation ==

By 2008, the rights to movie adaptations for all of the Shannara novels were sold to Warner Bros until 2010. Those rights expired, though Brooks continued to receive inquiries from film studios. In 2011, adaptation plans coalesced around a &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;-style series, backed by Sonar Entertainment and Farah Films, and executive produced by Brooks, Dan Farah, and Stewart Till. The story would begin with &quot;Elfstones&quot;, leaving &quot;Sword&quot;, the first book in the series, for later. By 2012, they were looking for a showrunner and director before pitching to network buyers, at which time they hoped to move into production.

In December 2013, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that MTV had given a script-to-series commitment to produce the show, with Jon Favreau directing, &quot;Smallville&quot; creators Al Gough and Miles Millar writing, and Brooks and Farah as executive producers. The result was &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot;, which premiered on January 5, 2016, on MTV. In an interview, Brooks mentioned his pleasure with how his story has been adapted. In January 2018, the series was cancelled after two seasons. Producers said that they would shop the series to other networks.

==Characters==

*Wil Ohmsford – Grandson of the legendary Shea Ohmsford, Wil is a good-hearted, calm young man. He takes after his grandfather in looks, with his fair hair and the pointed ears that mark him as having Elven blood. Unlike Shea who is quite callow before his adventures, Wil has a more mature outlook, partly due to the early death of his parents. Their untimely passing inspired him to train with the renowned Gnome Healers at Storlock, and due to his persistence he was eventually allowed to train there despite not being a Gnome. Because Wil has only a small fraction of Elven blood, mastery of the legendary Elfstones does not come as easily to him as it did to Shea, and this coupled with his own fear of the Elfstones&#x27; magic and his internal conflict over doing harm after having pledged his life to being a Healer hampers his ability to use them effectively. 
*Allanon – The powerful last Druid of Paranor, this human has mastered many forms of magic and is perfectly willing to hide most or all of the truth from those he protects or leads in order to achieve his goals. Together with Shea Ohmsford and others he defeated the Warlock Lord in the most recent War of the Races. Now, fifty years later, Allanon has returned, apparently without having aged a single day, and he gives Wil Ohmsford the job of protecting Amberle Elessedil.
*Amberle Elessedil – An Elven princess and the granddaughter of the current King of the Elves, Eventine Elessedil. She is the daughter of his youngest son, Aine (deceased). Selected by the Ellcrys to be a member of the Chosen, Amberle at first enjoys the attention from the Ellcrys but soon becomes disturbed by the sentient tree&#x27;s overbearing nature and her relationship to it, and she spurns her duty as a Chosen and leaves the Elven city of Arborlon. She is later convinced by Allanon and Wil to return to Arborlon, and she ultimately decides to take on the job of restoring the Ellcrys.
*Eventine Elessedil – King of the Elves who worked with Allanon and Shea Ohmsford to defeat the Warlock Lord. Fifty years later, he is still the leader of the Elves and still a strong, capable man despite his age. He has three sons; Arion, Ander, and Aine (deceased).
*Ander Elessedil – Son of Eventine, and uncle of Amberle.
*Eretria – a human girl raised since childhood by the rover Cephelo, giving a lot of trouble to Wil and the Elves but eventually becoming their ally in their mission to restore the Ellcrys&#x27; health.
*Stee Jans – Known as the &quot;Iron Man&quot;, he commands the legendary Free Corps of the Border Legion. This small but fierce force is sent to aid the Elves and they play a pivotal role in the defense of the Westland during the War of the Forbidding.
*The Ellcrys – A magical and sentient tree with silver bark and crimson red leaves, created by Elves eons ago in the midst of a great war in order to banish the Demons to a dimension called the Forbidding. So long as she stands and remains healthy, the Ellcrys will keep the Demons locked away in the Forbidding. The Ellcrys does age and die, requiring a rebirth, but its lifespan is on the order of centuries and millennia. As the tree weakens, the seal keeping Demons locked away in the Forbidding also weakens. She can communicate telepathically and can move her branches to touch people in greeting. Her bark is warm to the touch and she can give pieces of herself if necessary, as when she produced an &quot;Ellcrys staff&quot; for Allanon. Every year the Ellcrys chooses a select group of young Elves called the Chosen to care for her. The Chosen are almost always men; Amberle Elessedil is the first woman selected in centuries.
*Dagda Mor (demon) – 
*Changeling (demon)
*The Reaper (demon)

<text>Johann Beckmann (1739–1811) was a German scientific author and coiner of the word technology, to mean the science of trades. He was the first man to teach technology and write about it as an academic subject.

==Life==
He was born on 4 June 1739 at Hoya in Hanover, where his father was postmaster and receiver of taxes. He was educated at Stade and the University of Göttingen, where he studied theology, mathematics, physics, natural history, and public finance and administration. After completing his studies, in 1762 he made a study tour through Brunswick and the Dutch Republic examining mines, factories, natural history museums, private collections, universities and their professors.

The death of his mother in 1762 having deprived him of his means of support, he went in 1763 on the invitation of the pastor of the Lutheran community, Anton Friedrich Büsching, the founder of the modern historic statistical method of geography, to teach natural history in the Lutheran gymnasium St. Petrischule in St Petersburg, Russia. This office he relinquished in 1765, and travelled in Denmark and Sweden, during 1765–66, where he studied the methods of working the mines, factories and foundries as well as collections of art and natural history. He made the acquaintance of Linnaeus at Uppsala. (His travel diary of these journeys &quot;Schwedische Reise in den Jahren 1765–1766&quot; was published in Uppsala in 1911.) In 1766 he was appointed extraordinary professor of philosophy at Göttingen. There he lectured on political and domestic economy, and in 1768 he founded a botanic garden on the principles of Linnaeus. Such was his success that in 1770 he was appointed ordinary professor.

He was in the habit of taking his students into the workshops, that they might acquire a practical as well as a theoretical knowledge of different processes and handicrafts. While thus engaged he determined to trace the history and describe the existing condition of each of the arts and sciences on which he was lecturing. But even Beckmann&#x27;s industry and ardour were unable to overtake the amount of study necessary for this task. He therefore confined his attention to several practical arts and trades; and to these labors we owe his &quot;Beiträge zur Geschichte der Erfindungen&quot; (1780–1805), translated into English as the &quot;History of Inventions, discoveries and origins&quot; (1797, 4th ed 1846) a work in which he relates the origin, history and recent condition of the various machines, utensils, etc., employed in trade and for domestic purposes. This work entitles Beckmann to be regarded as the founder of scientific technology, a term which he was the first to use in 1772.

Beckmann&#x27;s approach was that of a scholar working in the Enlightenment, and his analytical writings on technology mirrored the work of Diderot and his Encyclopedie, and the Descriptions des Arts et Metiers. He must have been inspired by the taxonomic work of Linnaeus and the &quot;Bibliothecae&quot; of Albrecht von Haller. Nothing similar was being produced in English at that time. He was the first to write historical and critical accounts of the techniques of craft and manufacture and publish classifications of techniques. His goal was to produce a survey which would inspire others to make useful improvements.

In 1772 Beckmann was elected a member of the Royal Society of Göttingen, and he contributed valuable scientific dissertations to its proceedings until 1783, when he withdrew from all further share in its work. He was also member of scientific societies in Celle, Halle, Munich, Erfurt, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Saint Petersburg. 
In 1784, he was appointed a Councillor to the Hanoverian Court. In 1790, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1809 he became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

He died on 3 February 1811. 

Klemm states &#x27;[He] should be credited with being the first reliable historian of inventions&#x27; and so must be regarded as the father of the study of the History of Technology

A Johann Beckmann Society was founded in 1987 at Hoya to celebrate his life and work.

<doc id="811500" wikidata="Q1323782" url="?curid=811500" title="Nintendo VS. System">
<text>The is an arcade system that was developed and produced by Nintendo. It is based on most of the same hardware as the Family Computer (Famicom), later released as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). As Nintendo was planning to release the NES in North America, they were aware of the video game crash of 1983 and its effects on the home console market. By March 1984 the arcade industry recovered enough for a plan to introduce NES titles there, with the VS. System later being a presentation to players who did not yet own the console. It became the first version of the Famicom hardware to debut in North America.

Most of its games are conversions from the Famicom and NES, some heavily altered for the arcade format, and some debuted on the VS. System before being released on the Famicom or NES. The system focuses on two-player cooperative play. It was released in three different configurations: upright VS. UniSystem cabinets, upright VS. DualSystem cabinets, and sit-down VS. DualSystem cabinets. Games are on pluggable circuit boards, allowing for each side to have a different game.

The VS. System did not have lasting popularity in Japan, leading to Nintendo&#x27;s departure from arcade game development. In contrast, it was a commercial success in the United States, with about 100,000 arcade cabinets sold, becoming the highest-grossing arcade machine of 1985. The system&#x27;s success in arcades proved the market for the test release of the NES in North America in 1985. The final VS. System game was released in 1990.

==Background==
In 1980, Data East had introduced the concept of a convertible arcade system board, or arcade conversion system, with the DECO Cassette System, but it was not a major success. The first successful arcade conversion system is Sega&#x27;s Convert-a-Game system in the early 1980s. Its success led to several other arcade manufacturers introducing their own arcade conversion systems by the mid-1980s, including the Nintendo VS. System in 1984.

The Nintendo VS. System is important in the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The VS. System is the first version of the Family Computer (Famicom) hardware to debut in North America during 1984, the success of which proved the market for the official release of the NES console. Following the video game crash of 1983, the North American home video game market had collapsed. Nintendo&#x27;s negotiations with Atari to introduce the Famicom in North America failed due to Atari&#x27;s collapse, and Nintendo of America&#x27;s market research garnered warnings from retailers and distributors to stay away from home consoles, with US retailers refusing to stock game consoles. Meanwhile, the arcade game industry also had a slump as the golden age of arcade video games ended, but the arcade industry recovered and stabilized with the help of software conversion kit systems, such as Sega&#x27;s Convert-a-Game system, the Atari System 1, and the Nintendo-Pak system. Hiroshi Yamauchi realized there was still a market for video games in North America, where players were gradually returning to arcades in significant numbers. Yamauchi still had faith there was a market for the Famicom, so he introduced it to North America through the arcade industry.

Nintendo based the VS. System hardware on the Famicom, and introduced it as the successor to its Nintendo-Pak arcade system, which had been used for games such as &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot;. Though technologically weaker than Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; arcade hardware, the VS. System was relatively inexpensive. The Nintendo-Pak and &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; hardware also have a limited game library, whereas the VS. System accessed a wider variety of games, by easily converting Famicom games. Nintendo of America hired Jeff Walker from Bally to help market the VS. System in North America, where it debuted at the 1984 ASI show along with &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; in February.

==Hardware==
The VS. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot;, and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; cabinets, so they require the same special monitor. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors.

Almost all VS. System cabinets have identical hardware powered by a Ricoh 2A03 central processing unit (CPU), the same in the NES, except for special PPUs or video chips. Each chip contains a different palette that arrange the colors in different configurations chosen apparently at random. Most boards can be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs and the appropriate PPU or the game will have incorrect colors. Several of the later units employ further copy protection by using special PPUs which swap pairs of I/O registers or return special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory, and games are not interchangeable with these models.

Some dedicated double cabinets look like two games butted together at an angle, with a single motherboard. The Red Tent, a steel sit-down cabinet for the VS. DualSystem, allows play for up to four players simultaneously. It has the same motherboard as the double cabinet.

Because the &quot;VS. System&quot; has the same CPU as the NES, its games can be ported to the NES with modifications to the console including extra memory banks and additional DIP switches. Some games differ from their home console versions. For example, &quot;VS. Super Mario Bros.&quot; is considerably more difficult than &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;; some of the levels were reused in &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot; for the Famicom Disk System. Some games&#x27; graphics differ, such as &quot;VS. Duck Hunt&quot; having more details and animation sequences.

== Reception ==
Upon release, the VS. System generated excitement in the arcade industry, receiving praise for its easy conversions, affordability, flexibility, and multiplayer capabilities. Eddie Adlum of &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine said Nintendo had suddenly become &quot;the big guy on the block&quot; in 1984 due to the VS. System, which &quot;not only meant interchangeable games but interaction between players on dual-monitor games&quot;. For &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine, Roger C. Sharpe called it a &quot;highly attractive and open-ended interchangeable game system featuring excellent graphics and realistic on-screen visuals&quot; in 1984 and Gene Lewin gave the system a rating of 10+ out of 10 in 1985. Others criticized the system&#x27;s graphics as technologically weaker than more recent rival arcade systems, and than Nintendo&#x27;s own powerful &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; arcade hardware.

In Japan, &quot;VS. Tennis&quot; topped Japan&#x27;s chart for table arcade cabinets in April 1984 and May 1984, and &quot;VS. Baseball&quot; topped the chart in June and July 1984. By 1985, however, the VS. System had declined in Japan, which led to Yamauchi deciding to withdraw Nintendo from the Japanese coin-op industry in late 1985 and Nintendo focusing more on the Famicom.
In North America, by contrast, the VS. System became a major success. Following the arcade success of sports video games such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; (1983), Nintendo capitalized on this trend with sports games &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, &quot;VS. Tennis&quot;, and &quot;VS. Baseball&quot; with great success in the US arcade market; Sharpe considered Nintendo &quot;a force to reckon with&quot; based on this strong performance. The VS. System was declared an &quot;overwhelming hit&quot; by &quot;Play Meter&quot;, attributing its success to &quot;good games and low price&quot;. Between 10,000 and 20,000 arcade cabinets were sold in 1984, and individual &quot;VS.&quot; games were top earners on arcade charts. &quot;VS. Tennis&quot; topped the arcade charts for software conversion kits in July 1984 (on the &quot;RePlay&quot; charts) and August 1984 (on the &quot;Play Meter&quot; charts), and &quot;VS. Baseball&quot; topped the charts from September through November 1984. &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; and &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; then became even more popular in American arcades, popularizing light gun shooter video games. By 1985, 50,000 cabinets had been sold, establishing Nintendo as an industry leader in the arcades. In November 1985, five &quot;VS.&quot; games were on the US &quot;RePlay&quot; top 20 arcade charts, with &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; holding the top spot. &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; was also popular in arcades at the time. The VS. System went on to become the highest-grossing arcade platform of 1985 in the United States, and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; and &quot;Excitebike&quot; became the top two highest-grossing arcade system games that year.

The success of the VS. System gave Nintendo the confidence to repackage the Famicom for North America as the NES. Nintendo&#x27;s strong positive reputation in the arcades also generated significant interest in the NES. It also gave Nintendo the opportunity to test new games as VS. Paks in the arcades, to determine which games to release for the NES launch. Nintendo&#x27;s software strategy was to first release games for the Famicom, then the VS. System, and then for the NES. This allowed Nintendo to build a solid launch line-up for the NES. Many games&#x27; North American debut was on the VS. System before being released for the NES, which gave players the impression of being &quot;amazed&quot; at the accuracy of the arcade &quot;ports&quot; for the NES. At the time, most arcade game hardware was significantly more powerful than home console hardware, and game developers would go through significant effort to try to replicate arcade games on the less powerful home consoles, often with little success.

Within a few months of its 1986 release, 20,000 &quot;VS. Super Mario Bros.&quot; arcade units were sold, becoming the best-selling &quot;VS.&quot; release, with each unit consistently earning more than per week. Its arcade success helped introduce &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; to many players who did not yet own an NES. By the time the NES was launched in North America (from late 1985 to 1986), about 100,000 VS. Systems had been sold to American arcades. According to Ken Horowitz, the VS. System &quot;was perhaps the most vital catalyst in the rise of the NES to the top of the home video game market&quot;.

In Europe, the VS. System was also a success in arcades by early 1986, before the launch of the NES there. At London&#x27;s Amusement Trades Exhibition International (ATEI) show in January 1986, David Snook of &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine listed &quot;VS. Super Mario Bros.&quot; as one of the top five hits of the show, along with &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet&quot; and &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot;.

Nintendo of America announced in July 1992 that it would stop making arcade machines. The announcement included the last upcoming titles for the NES-based PlayChoice-10 and the SNES-based Nintendo Super System, but none for the VS. System.

==List of games==
Unknown prototypes of &quot;VS. System&quot; games may have been either unreleased or released briefly for market testing. The launch game is &quot;VS. Tennis&quot;, released in January 1984.

<text>ACiD Productions (ACiD) is a digital art group. Founded in 1990, the group originally specialized in ANSI artwork for bulletin board systems (BBS). More recently, they have extended their reach into other graphical media and computer software development. During the BBS-era, their biggest competitor was iCE Advertisements.

== History ==
ACiD Productions was founded in 1990 as ANSI Creators in Demand by five members: RaD Man, Shadow Demon, Grimm, The Beholder, and Phantom. Their work originally concentrated in ANSI and ASCII art, but the group later branched out into other artistic media such as tracker music, demo coding, and multimedia software development (e.g., image viewers). Membership rose from five members in 1990 to well over seven hundred by 2003.

In the mid-1990s, ACiD created subsidiary groups responsible for these broader areas. For example, Remorse is the official ACiD sub-label responsible for ASCII art and other text-based graphics. Similarly, pHluid is responsible for module tracking and music production, and ACiDic handles bulletin board software modification and enhancement.

Following the post dial-up BBS era, ACiD focused largely on the preservation of digital art history, talk radio news, the sale of their DVD-based artscene archives, and sponsorship of demoparties.

In 2008, the San Francisco gallery 20 goto 10 featured an exhibit of ACiD artists Somms and Lord Jazz.

In 2013, members from ACiD collaborated with 21st century ANSI art collective Blocktronics to produce &quot;Blocktronics ACiD Trip&quot;, a scrolling ANSI measuring lines tall. This ANSI artwork debuted at Demosplash at Carnegie Mellon University where it was awarded first place in the ANSI and ASCII category.

<text>Marie Dubas (3 September 1894 – 21 February 1972) was a French music-hall singer, diseuse and comedian.

==Biography ==
Born in Paris, France, Marie Dubas began her career as a stage actress but became famous as a singer. Using the great Yvette Guilbert as her model, Dubas started singing in the small cabarets of Montmartre mixing comedy into her routine. She earned a following that led to offers to perform in Parisian operettas and musicals and during the 1920s and 1930s, starred at such places as the Casino de Paris and Bobino, the great music hall in Montparnasse. Her most famous song, &quot;Mon légionnaire&quot;, was written by Raymond Asso and recorded in 1936. Her popularity became such that in 1939 she toured the United States.

The occupation of France by the Germans during World War II proved a difficult time for the Jewish Marie Dubas. Although married to a French gentile who served in the Air Force, she was nevertheless banned by the Vichy government and placed under house arrest by the Gestapo who raided her Paris apartment. Forced to flee the country, Dubas took refuge in Lausanne, Switzerland where she remained until the end of the war. On her return to France, she learned her sister had been executed and her nephew had been shipped to a concentration camp, never to be heard from again.

The inspiration for Édith Piaf, Marie Dubas returned to performing and in 1954 was chosen as a headliner for the reopening of the Paris Olympia. A stage production about her life, &quot;Dubas de haut, en bas&quot;, was created by Opéra Éclaté.

==Death ==
Marie Dubas retired in 1958. She died in Paris in 1972 and is interred there in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. She is largely forgotten today.

<doc id="811529" wikidata="Q6807437" url="?curid=811529" title="Medway Megaliths">
<text>The Medway Megaliths, sometimes termed the Kentish Megaliths, are a group of Early Neolithic chambered long barrows and other megalithic monuments located in the lower valley of the River Medway in Kent, South-East England. Constructed from local sarsen stone and soil between the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, they represent the only known prehistoric megalithic group in eastern England and the most south-easterly group in Britain.

They remain one of several regionally contained chambered long barrow traditions in Britain, although have certain precise architectural characteristics which mark them out as distinct from other groups. 
The purpose of these long barrows remains elusive, although some were used as tombs for the remains of a select group of individuals. It is also widely believed that they were places where religious rituals were performed. Many archaeologists believe that they reflect the process of Neolithisation of Britain, as hunter-gatherer populations were replaced by pastoralists.

Three chambered tombs have been identified to the west of the river: the Coldrum Stones, Addington Long Barrow, and Chestnuts Long Barrow. To the east of the river, another three chambered tombs have been identified: Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, although it has also been suggested that two nearby megaliths, the Coffin Stone and the White Horse Stone, are remnants of former chambered tombs. An Early Neolithic longhouse and causewayed enclosure have also been identified in the vicinity of the monuments.

The Medway Megaliths have become heavily damaged and dilapidated since original construction, largely due to an intentional program of destruction in the late 13th century CE. They began to attract the interest of antiquarians in the late 16th century, who developed a number of erroneous theories about their origin, before later being scientifically investigated by archaeologists in the late 19th century. Local folklore has also grown up around the monuments, which came to be interpreted and used as sacred sites by contemporary Pagans in the latter 20th century.

==Background==
The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Beginning in the fifth millennium BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. Archaeologists have been unable to prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental Europe or because the indigenous Mesolithic Britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies. Either way, it certainly emerged through contact with continental Europe, probably as a result of centuries of interaction between Mesolithic people living in south-east Britain and Linear Pottery culture (LBK) communities in north-eastern France.

Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, all of the British Isles came to abandon its former Mesolithic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, to be replaced by the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. It is apparent that although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. There is archaeological evidence of violence and warfare in Early Neolithic Britain from such sites as West Kennet Long Barrow and Hambledon Hill, with some groups constructing fortifications to defend themselves from attackers. Contemporary archaeologists have no direct proof of gender relations on the island at this time, although most believe that it was probably a male-dominated society, in keeping with all recorded societies that practice large-scale animal husbandry.

Britain was largely forested in this period, although did witness some land clearance. It remains unclear to what extent the Kentish area was deforested in the Early Neolithic, although it appears that widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain much later, in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and &quot;Maloideae&quot;.

===The tomb building tradition===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead, and though sometimes constructed out of timber, many were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. The construction of these collective burial monumental tombs, both wooden and megalithic, began in continental Europe before being adopted in Britain in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE.

The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done. Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. It has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance. For this reason, historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. Archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on &quot;territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors.&quot; Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by Neolithicisation. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

Archaeologists have differentiated these Early Neolithic tombs into a variety of different architectural styles, each typically associated with a different region within the British Isles. Passage graves, characterised by their narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone, were predominantly located in northern Britain and southern and central Ireland. Alternately, across northern Ireland and central Britain long chambered mounds predominated, while in the east and south-east of Britain, earthen long barrows represented the dominant architectural trend. These earthen long barrows were typically constructed of timber because building stone was scarce in southern Britain; archaeologist Aubrey Burl argued that these timber tombs might have been &quot;even more eye-catching&quot; than their stone counterparts, perhaps consisting of &quot;towering carved poles, flamboyantly painted&quot;, but that evidence of such sculptures has not survived. The Medway Megaliths represent just one of these regional groups within the wider West European tradition of tomb building in this period.

==Description==

Although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most south-easterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. Archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be &quot;some of the most interesting and well known&quot; archaeological sites in Kent, while archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as &quot;the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England&quot;. The BBC &quot;Countryfile&quot; website notes that although none of the monuments are on the same scale as Stonehenge, they are &quot;really quite impressive&quot; when taken collectively, describing them as &quot;the east of England&#x27;s answer to the megaliths of the Salisbury Plains&quot;.

They can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 km. The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

Such common architectural features among these tomb-shrines indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. For instance, they would have been taller than most other tomb-shrines in Britain, with internal heights of up to 10 ft. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic tomb-shrines (such as the Cotswold-Severn group), there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut long barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. This variation might have been caused by the tomb-shrines being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would represent composite structures.

It seems apparent that the people who built these monuments were influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines that they were already aware of. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, Stuart Piggott thought that they had originated in the area around the Low Countries, while Glyn Daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia. John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group. Paul Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

There is little evidence for deposition within the tomb-shrines, largely due to the damage that they have sustained. Human bone has been found in the Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Coffin Stone, burned bone from Chestnuts Long Barrow, and pot sherds from Chestnuts, Addington, and Kit&#x27;s Coty. They have thus usually been interpreted as collective tombs for the interment of the physical remains of the dead. Ashbee believed that the area surrounding the megaliths might have been a &quot;ritual landscape&quot; that was believed to possess &quot;especial qualities&quot;, thus explaining why Early Neolithic people decided to construct the monuments at this location. Killick suggested that the area was chosen because of the visually imposing nature of the local landscape, also suggesting that it might have been chosen because it allowed for intervisibility between the different monuments. Inspired by ideas pioneered elsewhere by the archaeologist Chris Tilley, Killick suggested that the Medway Megaliths were oriented to point at either the Downs or the River, noting that five of the monuments point toward at least one of these two geographical features. The views visible from the monuments are not however uniform; had the vicinity been deforested, then Kit&#x27;s Coty, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty and Coldrum would have had 360° panoramic views of the landscape, whereas only a third of the local landscape is visible from Addington and Chestnuts Long Barrows. Killick also thought it probably that intervisibility was a factor in locating the monuments, noting that Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Little Kit&#x27;s Coty and the Coffin Stone were probably intervisible in the Early Neolithic, as were Addington and Chestnuts Long Barrow, and the White Horse Stones and Smythe&#x27;s Megalith.

===Related activity===

Other evidence of Neolithic activity has also been identified in the vicinity of the megaliths. Excavation by the Oxford Archaeological Unit in the late 1990s revealed the existence of a Neolithic longhouse close to the White Horse Stone. It was stylistically very similar to longhouses belonging to the linearbandkeramic (LBK) and post-LBK cultures of central and north-western Europe, which are dated to the 5th and 6th millennia BCE. Three of the building&#x27;s post holes contained sherds of Early Neolithic ceramic Plain Bowls, which were radiocarbon dated to 4110–3530 cal BCE. In the vicinity, sherds of Clacton-style Grooved Ware and Mortlake-style Peterborough ware ceramics were also found, dating from the Mid-to-Late Neolithic, suggesting that activity continued at the site over a long period of time (c.3750–2250 BCE). It is not known what the purpose of the longhouse was, or whether it was primarily domestic or ritualistic in function, although excavators expressed their opinion that it was probably domestic and communal in use. Conversely, the archaeologist Paul Ashbee thought it likely that it was a &quot;cult-house&quot; on the basis of its isolated nature. Evidence of a smaller, circular building was found to the south-east of the longhouse, although this might have been later in date. Ashbee highlighted that the stone long barrows stylistically emulated the wooden long houses, and that this was probably an act of conscious imitation.

An Early Neolithic causewayed enclosure was also found in the vicinity of the megaliths, at Burham. The enclosure consists of two closely spaced concentric ditches, surrounding an oval-shaped area measuring 5 ha. It is thus the largest known causewayed enclosure in Kent and one of the largest known in Britain. Excavation in 2009–10 unearthed dating evidence showing that the enclosure was in use from &quot;circa&quot; 3700 to 3400 BCE.

The Medway Megaliths are not the only Early Neolithic mound monuments in modern Kent, with another group of long barrows being located around the Stour valley. Here, three monuments are still evident: Julliberrie&#x27;s Grave, Boughton Aluph barrow, and Elmstead barrow. These Stour monuments primarily differ from their Medway counterparts in that they have not been built using sarsens, and are thus non-megalithic, unchambered long barrows. The decision by the builders of these Stour Long-Barrows to avoid using stone as a building material was likely deliberate, for sarsens are naturally present in the local area and could have been obtained without too much trouble.

==Later history==
Throughout later prehistory, the landscape around the Medway megaliths continued to be used for ritual and ceremonial purposes, including rich Bronze Age burials, gold deposits in the Late Bronze Age, an Iron Age cemetery with several rich bucket burials and a potential Romano-British temple on Blue Bell Hill. Evidence for a settlement dating to the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age has been identified on the western side of the valley by the White Horse Stone, as evidenced by postholes indicating possible roundhouses and numerous four-post structures, alongside pits that might originally have been used for storage. In the Medieval period, the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way track was constructed close to the megaliths.

In the latter 13th century, the Medway Megaliths were systematically damaged, although this was accomplished in different ways. Some of the chambers were completely toppled, while others were left standing. The reasons for this destruction are not entirely clear. Ashbee suggested that it was due to the Christian Church&#x27;s renewed attempt to consolidate its control over non-Christian beliefs and practices, in conjunction with the Northern Crusade that was supported by both Edward I and Edward III of England. He also suggested that the construction of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church at Tottington, St. Michael&#x27;s Church at Cosington, and St. Margaret&#x27;s Church at Addington, all in the vicinity of the megaliths, was potentially part of this same process.

===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===
From the late 16th century, the Medway Megaliths began to be discussed in the published literature of antiquarians. A number of the megaliths were damaged or destroyed during the 19th century, perhaps to be broken up and used as building material by local masons.

Antiquarian investigations came to be replaced by archaeological ones in the 19th century. In 1871 E.H.W. Dunkin published a paper titled &quot;On the Megalithic Remains in Mid-Kent&quot; in which he discussed the monuments and included his own plans of their lay-outs. In 1908, George Klint included information on the megaliths in his Kentish volume of the &quot;Victoria County History&quot;, in which he included early photographs of the structures and identified them as being Neolithic in origin. In 1924, O.G.S. Crawford provided locations and further information on the sites in his &quot;Ordnance Survey Professional Paper&quot;, in which he also discussed their origins.

In 1982, Robin Holgate published a paper in &quot;Archaeologia Cantiana&quot; in which he reassessed the stones in the context of contemporary thought as to megalithic archaeology in Britain. He noted that sample excavation at each site would be necessary in order to develop a &quot;chronological and structural framework&quot; for the tradition. From October 1998 to March 1999, the company Oxford Archaeological Unit excavated the site around the White Horse Stone at the behest of Union Railways (South) (URS) in advance of the construction of the nearby Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The excavations were directed by Richard Brown.
Archaeologist Paul Garwood of the University of Birmingham oversaw a six-year fieldwork program known as the Medway Valley Prehistoric Landscapes Project from 2006 to 2012 in which he mapped the landscape surrounding the megaliths.
During 2007–08, archaeologist Sian Killick performed a phenomenological survey of the tombs in their surrounding landscape, looking at factors of intervisibility.

===Religious and folk practices===

Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, the most publicly visible of which is Druidry. As of 2014, a Druidic group known as Roharn&#x27;s Grove were recorded as performing their ceremonies at the monuments, as were Heathen groups like the neo-völkisch Odinic Rite and Woden&#x27;s Folk.

Analysing Pagan uses of the Megaliths, the scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of &quot;earth energy&quot;. He argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their &quot;own spiritual ancestors&quot; and because the sites were once chambered tombs, and thus held the remains of the dead, who themselves may have been perceived as ancestors. On this latter point, it is apparent that Pagan perspectives on these sites are themselves shaped by older archaeological interpretations. Doyle White also observed differences in how this concept of ancestry was understood: among the Heathens, this concept of ancestry was expressly genetic and racial, with the figures being &quot;ancestors of the blood&quot;. Conversely, the Druids emphasised &quot;ancestors of the land&quot;, with whom they share a spiritual connection rather than a necessarily racial one. The Pagans also cited the Megaliths as spots marking sources of &quot;earth energy&quot;, often aligned on ley lines, an idea likely derived ultimately from the publications of Earth Mysteries proponents like John Michell.

==The western stones==

===Coldrum Long Barrow===

Coldrum Long Barrow, also known as the Coldrum Stones and the Coldrum, sits north-east of the village of Trottiscliffe and about 500 metres from the Pilgrims Way track. The tomb is situated on a small ridge facing east, towards the Medway. About 20 metres in length, the width at the western end is about 15 metres, and 19 metres at the eastern end, thus forming a truncated wedge-shape.

It is the best preserved of the Medway Megaliths. Nevertheless, it has suffered much damage, particularly to its eastern side, where the sarsen boulders have broken away from the monument and fallen down the ridge.

The name &quot;Coldrum&quot; dates from at least the mid-19th century, and comes from an adjacent farmhouse, Coldrum Lodge, which has since been demolished. From 1842 to 1844, the antiquarian Beale Post authored an unpublished account of the monument in which he stated that skulls had been found in the terrace, close to the chamber, in 1804 and 1825. The earliest known reference in print to the Coldrum Stones comes from Albert Way 1845, when it was erroneously described as a stone circle with a cromlech. In 1856, John Mitchell Kemble and the Reverend Lambert Larkin excavated at the site, reporting to the Central Committee of the British Archaeological Association that they had discovered sherds of pottery, some of which they suspected to be Anglo-Saxon in date.

The first published plan of the monument came from E.H.W. Dunkin in 1871, although a more detailed plan was published by Flinders Petrie in 1878, and the first photograph of the site was published in 1893. In 1910, F.J. Bennett undertook an excavation at the site, revealing the bones of 22 individuals, of both sexes and various ages, along with a pot sherd and a flint saw, which had been buried in the north-western part of the monument. Further bones were excavated in a 1922 excavation by E.W. Filkins, but these were largely lost during the Second World War. In 1926, the monument was given to the National Trust who dedicated it as a memorial to the local historian Benjamin Harrison. In 1946, the folklorist John H. Evans noted that locally, the Coldrum Long Barrows had come to be associated with the folkloric trope of the countless stones. The site is open free of charge to the public throughout the year, and can be accessed by foot along Coldrum Lane.

===Addington Long Barrow===

Addington long barrow is situated about 250 metres north of the parish church in Addington, and can be accessed via one of two small roads that branch off from the A2. A peristalith, the monument is approximately 60 metres in length, although its width tapers, from 14 metres at the east to 11 metres at the west. The stone chamber was apparently on the eastern end, although has now collapsed.
The monument is now bisected by a road running through the middle of it.
The mound of the barrow is currently one metre high, although would initially have been much higher, having succumbed to millennia of weathering.
The first published record that commented on the existence of stones at the site was in 1719, although they would only be described as the relics of a prehistoric survival in print in 1779, when it was erroneously described as a stone circle and compared to Stonehenge. When the road was widened and deepened in 1827, two of the stones from the revetment curb were removed and deposited in the corner of the wood to the south of the barrow. The site was excavated circa 1845 by a local vicar, the Reverend Lambert Larking, who allegedly found some evidence of ceramics; it has also been asserted, although not proven, that he discovered human bones at the site. When Thomas Wright explored it c.1850, he was aided by a local man who enthusiastically believed that a crock of gold would be buried there, something that Leslie Grinsell deemed to be part of local folklore.

Edwin Dunkin produced a plan of the site in 1871, with a more accurate plan being created by Augustus Pitt-Rivers in 1878.
The monument underwent a measured survey in 1981 by a team from the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit (KARU). KARU continued to monitor the status of the monument, and in 2007 archaeologist Brian Philp noted that rabbit burrowing had compromised the road; as the road was being repaired, a previously unknown sarsen was discovered buried on the northern side of the monument.
The rabbit burrowing prompted rescue excavations in 2007 and 2010 led by Paul Garwood of the University of Birmingham. This revealed buried sarsens on the north side of the monument, but no dating evidence.
The site is situated on privately owned land, although is visible from the road.

===Chestnuts Long Barrow===
Chestnuts Long Barrow is located around 100 metres north-west of Addington long barrow. The mound itself no longer exists, although the eastern end of the barrow is still marked out by sarsens, some of which have been re-erected to their original positions. Although the earthen mound no longer exists in any form, it has been estimated that it would have been 20 metres long and around 15 metres wide. The chamber would have been 12 ft long, 7 ft wide, and 9 ft high, thus being described by Paul Ashbee as being of &quot;huge and unusual proportions&quot;. Inside the chamber had been deposited human bone, cremated bone, flint artefacts, and ceramic sherds.

The first unequivocal published mention of the Chesnuts Long Barrow was provided by antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in 1773; he erroneously considered it to be a stone circle, describing it as one of &quot;the temples of the antient [sic] Britons&quot;. In 1778 John Thorpe wrongly associated the monument with the ancient druids, and it was not until 1863 that Charles Moore Jessop recognised that the stones had once been part of a chambered tomb.
The site was excavated in 1957 by John Alexander at the behest of the Ancient Monuments Inspectorate of the Ministry of Works due to the construction of a house nearby. Human bone and other artefacts discovered were deposited in Maidstone Museum. Much of this material was destroyed during the 1980s by a fire in the museum, preventing the human remains from being radiocarbon dated. In 1981, a team from the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit performed a measurement survey of the monument.

The barrow is located on private land, and is accessible for a small fee.

==The eastern stones==

===Kit&#x27;s Coty House===
Kit&#x27;s Coty House represents the surviving remains of another chambered tomb, and has been described by archaeologist Timothy Champion as &quot;perhaps the best-known monument in Kent&quot;. The long mound has eroded away, leaving only a dolmen on the eastern end of the monument, which consists of three large upright stones, with a fourth capstone on top. Traces of the mound and peristalith were identified in January 1982 during a measured survey by the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit, in which they showed it to be 70m long, estimating that it was about 1m high.

Archaeologist Paul Garwood noted that the chamber&#x27;s closest parallels come from western Britain. Garwood&#x27;s team investigated the site from 2009 to 2012, using excavations and geophysical surveys. They revealed that the chamber was not directly connected to the long mound, being offset to the south, and thus was potentially part of a structure that predated the long mound. They also revealed that the long mound had gone through at least two main phases of construction.
Due to its accessibility, Kit&#x27;s Coty House has attracted continual notice since the 16th century. In the latter part of that century, the stones were discussed in print by three antiquarians: William Lambarde, William Camden, and John Stow. Although not featured in the first edition, Lambarde discussed Kit&#x27;s Coty in the second edition of his &quot;Perambulation of Kent&quot;, published in 1596. Here he compares it to Stonehenge in Wiltshire, describing it as having been erected by ancient Britons to the memory of Catigern, a figure whom he presumably knew about through the work of Nennius. He also noted that the site was associated with the mythical hero Horsa, whom he believed had been buried nearby. However, it was the discussion of the work in Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; that resulted in it becoming more widely known and developing into a visitor&#x27;s attraction; for instance, Samuel Pepys recorded his 1669 visit to the site in his diary.

It attracted the interest of antiquarian John Aubrey, who wrote about it in his &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;, in which he included an image of the site drawn by classical scholar Thomas Gale. William Stukeley first visited the site in October 1722, making various drawings and plans of the monument, and would later publish his findings, albeit without reference to either Horsa or Catigern. In 1722, Hercules Ayleway recorded a local belief that the monument had been erected in memorial to two contending kings of Kent, who died in a battle nearby.

Following the introduction of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments, Augustus Pitt Rivers, visited Kit&#x27;s Coty in April 1886, noting that it was being damaged by ploughing and graffiti. He ensured that it was categorised as a protected monument in 1885, and that an iron railing be put around the chamber, although not the mound, which would be subject to further damage through ploughing.
In 1946, folklorist John H. Evans recorded another local piece of folklore that the megalithic dolmen was constructed by three witches living on Blue Bell Hill, while the capstone was then raised atop with the aid of a fourth witch.
The monument is currently surrounded by iron railings, and is regularly visited by tourists.

===Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House===
Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, also known as Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House and the Countless Stones, is located about 3 km north east of the village of Aylesford. It is permanently open to visitors, although the monument is enclosed within iron railings. In its current state, it consists of about 21 stones of various sizes.

The antiquarian John Aubrey noted the existence of Little Kit&#x27;s Coty in his unpublished &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;, having been informed of its existence by classical scholar Thomas Gale. It was also investigated and detailed by fellow antiquarian William Stukeley, who noted that it was once a chambered tomb in his posthumously published &quot;Itinerarium Curiosum&quot; of 1776. Stukeley had been informed that many of the stones in the monument had been pulled down in the late 17th century. By the early 19th century, the site was being erroneously associated with the ancient druids, and by the middle of the century was associated with the folkloric tale of the countless stones, thus gaining the actual moniker of &quot;the Countless Stones&quot;. In 1887, it became a scheduled ancient monument.

Folklorist Leslie Grinsell believed that it only adopted the name &quot;Countless Stones&quot; following the monument&#x27;s pillaging circa 1690. The folktale held that an Aylesford baker attempted to count the stones by placing a loaf on each of the stones, but one loaf disappeared, with the Devil appearing in its place. At the end, the baker tried to count the loaves, but found that he had one more than he had brought with him. As he was about to call out the number of the stones, he then fell dead. In 1976, Grinsell noted that this folkloric belief still survived, as evidenced by numbers chalked on to the stones.

===Coffin Stone===
The Coffin Stone is located about 400 metres north-west of Little Kits Coty House, and is also around 250 metres away from the Pilgrims Way.

The Coffin Stone is a rectangular sarsen measuring about 4.40m by 2.80m, and is at least 50 cm thick. Archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto thought that this stone marked the chamber of a chambered long-barrow, noting that an outline of a mound could be seen. They highlighted that two smaller stones exist nearby, and that another sarsen was also located close by; in 1980, a farmer shifted that latter stone atop the Coffin Stone, where it still resides.

The monument&#x27;s existence was noted in Stukeley&#x27;s 1776 &quot;Itinerarium Curiosum&quot;. In the 1840s, an antiquary and Druid from Maidstone, Beal Poste, published an account in which he asserted that a sack full of human bones was found in the vicinity of the Stone during the 1830s. A slightly different account was provided by Edwin Dunkin in 1871; he asserted that a hedge had been removed in 1836, revealing the stone along with two human skulls, several bones, and charcoal, although he did not state the provenance of this account.

In 2008 and 2009, a team led by Garwood&#x27;s team excavated at the site, revealing that the sarsen had only been placed in its current position during the Post-Medieval period (c.1450–1600), and thus was not the fallen orthostat of a chambered tomb as had previously been believed.
 Garwood nevertheless suggested that it might have been erected as a monolith during later prehistory, as evidence citing a large hollow in the chalk adjacent to the stone, which he asserted had similarities with the extraction hollows of the Cuckoo Stone and Torstone discovered during the Stonehenge Riverside Project.

===Smythe&#x27;s Megalith===
Another chambered tomb once existed in a large field east of the A229, which is sometimes termed Smythe&#x27;s Megalith. In 1823 or 1824, the landowner, George Fowle, found that large sarsens beneath the soil were interfering with ploughing. When he tried removing them, he discovered three upright sarsens, and brought Maidstone historian Clement Taylor Smythe to investigate the site. Smythe&#x27;s excavation revealed a rectilinear stone chamber, containing the bones of at least two adults and a pot sherd. None of the monument remains visible. From the account, Ashbee noted that the chamber was clearly oriented on an east–west axis like the rest of the Medway Megaliths and that the chamber would have been at the eastern end of a long barrow.

===The White Horse Stones===
The Upper White Horse Stone is located inside a narrow strip of woodland east of the A229 dual carriageway, and can be reached via the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way track. Erected in an upright position, the stone measures 2.90m in length, 1.65m in height, and 60 cm in width. There are nine smaller stones extending westward from the Upper White Horse Stone for about 10 metres. These might represent parts of a chambered tomb, although there is no evidence of a mound, and it is possible that they are actually stones moved from an adjacent field by farmers. About 300m west of the Upper White Horse Stone was a second large upright stone, known as Lower White Horse Stone, but this was destroyed in the 1820s, and its site is probably now under the dual-carriageway.

S.C. Lampreys recorded a piece of local folklore in the early 19th century which held that in the Battle of Aylesford of 455, Hengist and Horsa flew the banner of the White Horse, before it was found next to or under the White Horse Stone. Ashbee noted that this folk tale was probably no older than the 17th century, because it made use of the motif of the White Horse of Kent which developed at that point. Ashbee believed that much of the folklore associated with the White Horse Stone was originally associated with the Lower White Horse Stone, only transferring to the Upper counterpart upon the former&#x27;s destruction.

===Other possible tombs===
In 1980, a farmer discovered two large buried stones near the eastern group of chambered long barrows. Excavation by the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit revealed four further medium-sized stones buried in pits dug into the underlying chalk. The excavators believed that this represented a potential chambered long barrow.

<text>Paul Neumann (1839 – July 2, 1901) was a lawyer, politician, and diplomat in California and the Kingdom of Hawaii.

==Background==
Born and educated in Prussia, Neumann and his twin brother Edward relocated to California in 1854. The brothers worked in the goldmines, where Paul broke his leg.

Eventually, Edward relocated to New Orleans and Paul moved to San Francisco. He became a lawyer in California around 1864, and was elected to represent San Francisco for three terms in the California State Senate.

==Hawaii==

He worked for fellow-German American Claus Spreckels (1828–1908), who maintained a monopoly of the refining of sugar from Hawaii in California.
Neuman met Hawaiian royalty when they would come to California to be entertained by Spreckels. 
Neumann was the Republican Party of California&#x27;s candidate for the United States House of Representatives in November 1882 for the San Francisco district. However, he was attacked by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as being a &quot;sugar coated candidate&quot;, claiming he&#x27;s being used by Spreckels, and was defeated in the election. In 1883, Neumann came to the Hawaiian Islands to serve as legal counsel for Spreckels who was now the publisher of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; newspaper, first in the fall for a short visit.
He was one of the first Jewish leaders in the Hawaiian Islands, although in later years he led a more secular life and did not raise his children in the Jewish faith.

Being from Europe, Neumann was comfortable around a monarchy, and made friends with the other Europeans in the islands. King David Kalākaua and other members of the government depended on loans from Spreckels to support their lifestyles.
Within days of returning, Neumann was admitted to the bar and appointed as attorney general of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and a member of Kalākaua&#x27;s Privy Council on December 14, 1883.
Walter M. Gibson had been acting as attorney general, even though he had no legal training. The cabinet stayed intact until June 30, 1886, when another combination (except Gibson) was brought in, probably at the suggestion of Spreckels.
Neumann was sometimes attacked by the conservative press for his &quot;bohemianism&quot;, including playing Poker with the king, which the missionaries thought was sinful. He had been president of the Bohemian Club in San Francisco
Charles T. Gulick, although related to missionaries, also became a member of the Kalākaua cabinet as Minister of the Interior.

In 1884 Neumann was appointed to the House of Nobles in the kingdom legislature, and the board of health. 
He served as envoy to Mexico in 1884, and investigated forming a consular office in San Francisco in 1885. Under the new 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the House of Nobles became an elected office, so he lost his seat, until winning the election of 1892 for one more session.

Queen Liliuokalani appointed him attorney general again on August 29, but he resigned the next day after a motion of no confidence in the legislature, when his scheme for a state lottery was heavily opposed in the legislature. On September 12 he was appointed again and served to November 1, 1892.
Neumann became the private attorney of the queen after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. He was sent to Washington, DC to protest the overthrow and plead for the restoration of the monarchy. After an editorial in the &quot;Advertiser&quot; offended him, Neumann (who had a wooden leg) attacked new editor Henry Northrop Castle (son of Samuel Northrup Castle) with his cane in December 1893.
He defended Liliuokalani and other prisoners in a military tribunal following the failed 1895 rebellion against the Republic of Hawaii, where she was convicted of misprision of treason. He advised Liliuokalani to issue a formal abdication, which she did, and the revolutionaries were pardoned.
When a circuit judge position opened up, he was passed over for the much younger William Stanley.

After the islands were annexed to the United States in 1898, he became more resigned to the situation, and applied to be the first attorney from Hawaii to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States. He did think the Crown Lands of Hawaii had been seized illegally, a case that is still controversial.

Although he had no government position, he was accepted in society enough to become toastmaster of the local Masonic Lodge, and president of the Hawaii Bar Association. 
He represented many of the Chinese victims of the Great Honolulu Chinatown Fire of 1900.
He died July 2, 1901.
At his funeral he was called &quot;one of the most brilliant men who ever set foot on Hawaiian soil&quot;. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery.

==Personal life and death==

His daughter Eva (1871–1921) married Alfred Fowler (1860–1933) and became a friend of Ezra Pound.
Son Edouard Neumann graduated from the United States Naval Academy (nominated by California congressman Julius Kahn), but was killed in a fire during target practice on the on April 13, 1904. Son Paul Neumann Jr. studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and lived in London.
Neumann&#x27;s wife Elisa also moved to London, as did daughter Lily Neumann who married Robert MacDonald Bird.
Other daughters Anita A. Neumann married Herman T. Focke in Honolulu in 1895, and Inez Sophie Neumann married William F. C. Hasson in 1891 who moved to Annapolis, Maryland.
His wife Elisa went to Acapulco, Mexico in 1908 to settle the estate of her mother and stepfather who had both died. On a steamer to San Francisco she died after jumping overboard.

<text>Launched in 1984, the Transformers toyline by Takara Tomy and Hasbro was promoted through both a comic book by Marvel Comics and an animated series produced by Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions with Toei Animation. Although the comic outlived the animated series by a number of years, the animated series is more widely recognised. With the original show&#x27;s conclusion in 1987, original series exclusive to Japan were created which ran until 1990, and the franchise was later re-imagined with the fully CGI &quot;Beast Wars&quot; in the late 1990s. The 21st century saw a total reboot of the Transformers universe (first being Takara&#x27;s produced &quot;Car Robots&quot;, imported and retitled for Western release as &quot;&quot;), as Hasbro collaborated with Japanese Transformers producers Takara to create a new storyline with &quot;&quot; and its sequels, produced in Japan and then dubbed for English-speaking audience. In 2008, &quot;Transformers Animated&quot; saw Hasbro take control of the franchise once more through collaboration with Cartoon Network, bringing writing duties back to America, with animation being handled by Japanese studios. Hasbro also reacquired the distribution rights to the original series from Sunbow finally giving them the complete rights to the series based on their Generation 1 toy-line.

== Overview ==
==&quot;Gobots&quot;==
Although initially a separate and competing franchise in 1984, Tonka&#x27;s Gobots became the intellectual property of Hasbro after their buyout of Tonka in 1991. Subsequently, the universe depicted in the animated series and its follow-up film was established as an alternate universe within the Transformers Multiverse.

==Transformers: Generation 1==
The term &quot;Generation 1&quot;, or &quot;G1&quot;, is a retronym, coined after the advent of 1992&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Although frequently used to simply refer to the original 1984-1991 Marvel comic series, 1984-1987 animated series, the term encompasses all Transformers fiction from 1984 to 1992.
===&quot;The Transformers&quot;===
After the Federal Communications Commission did away with regulations that prohibited toy companies from broadcasting cartoons based on their products in 1985, &quot;The Transformers&quot; began with a three-episode miniseries that introduced audiences to Optimus Prime, Megatron and their armies, as they travelled from the metal world of Cybertron to Earth in search of new sources of energy. The final episode ended on an open note, should the series prove popular enough to continue, which it did. A standard season&#x27;s worth of 13 more episodes was commissioned, expanding the Transformers universe in which the Dinobots, Constructicons and Jetfire (then later called &quot;Skyfire&quot; in the series) made their debut. With popularity rising, the second season soon followed in 1986 at a mammoth 49 episodes (in order to bring the total up to 65, for syndication). Dozens of new characters were introduced throughout the season, including the Triple Changers, the combining teams the Aerialbots, Stunticons, Combaticons and Protectobots, and more new Autobot cars and Decepticon planes, while many new ideas and concepts began to establish the history of the cartoon universe.

These 65 episodes were exported to Japan in the same year, where their airing order was rearranged and the series was broadcast under the title of &quot;Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers&quot;. An OVA exclusive to Japan entitled &quot;&quot; was released which cast focus on the combining teams and introduced Ultra Magnus, Metroplex, Ratbat, Trypticon, and Blaster&#x27;s cassettes. This video does not perfectly fit into the continuity of the American series due to its different origin story for Trypticon (known as Dinosaurer in the Japanese version).

1986 marked a huge change for &quot;The Transformers&quot; with the summer screening of &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, which jumped the action forward in time twenty years to the then-future of 2005 and pitted both the Autobots and Decepticons against the menace of the giant planet-eating robot, Unicron. Optimus Prime met his end at Megatron&#x27;s hands, and Ultra Magnus briefly replaced him as a leader before being succeeded by Rodimus Prime, while Megatron himself was recreated by Unicron as Galvatron. Many more of the old guard fell in battle as their toys departed store shelves to make room for a new cast of characters created for the film.

1986 also saw the start of the third season of the animated series, which took its cue from the film, picking up precisely where it had left off with Rodimus in command and the Decepticons in exile with Galvatron missing. The season opened with a five-part miniseries entitled &quot;Five Faces of Darkness&quot; which saw Galvatron return and brought to prominence the Quintessons, multi-faced aliens introduced in the movie who were revealed to be the creators of the Transformer race, and who became a recurring third factor as the season continued through its setting of 2006. The addition of Flint Dille as story editor saw a strong sci-fi aspect infect the season as the Transformers&#x27; battles spanned many alien planets, while continuity between episode was tighter than ever before as plot concepts were revisited and expanded to truly flesh out the show&#x27;s history. Running to 30 episodes, the third season ended with the two-part &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime&quot;, bringing the legendary Autobot leader back to life. Broadcast in Japan once again, the series was retitled &quot;Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers: 2010&quot; (or &quot;Transformers: 2010&quot; for short), advancing its setting to the eponymous year.

1987 marked the end of the original American series, mirroring its beginning with a three-part miniseries entitled &quot;The Rebirth&quot;. Penned by regular series writer David Wise (who had previously written several of the series&#x27; mythology-building episodes), this finale story introduced the Headmasters and Targetmasters, as well as several other characters. Concluding with the restoration of Cybertron&#x27;s Golden Age, the Decepticons stole the final scene of the series to prove that their threat still lingered. It is unknown the exact reason the American series ended after the movie, though it is assumed that Sunbow had lost its contract to keep its cartoons running by 1987 (the final Transformers episode &quot;The Rebirth&quot; coincided with the final G.I. Joe episode &quot;G.I. Joe: the Movie&quot;).

Additionally, a fifth season of sorts was aired in 1988, serving as a kind of &quot;best of&quot; collection of the series. The most notable feature of this twenty-episode run was the new intro and concluding segments added to the episodes, which consisted of Powermaster Optimus Prime (rendered in a mixture of puppetry and stop motion animation) relating the events of the episodes to a human boy named Tommy Kennedy. The opening sequence comprised animation taken from contemporary toy adverts, and Prime occasionally referred to new toy characters like Cloudburst. Apparently never re-run after its original airing, the series aired &quot;More Than Meets the Eye&quot; Parts 1-3, &quot;Five Faces of Darkness&quot; Parts 1-5, &quot;Dark Awakening&quot;, the out-of-place &quot;Surprise Party&quot;, &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime&quot; Parts 1-2, &quot;The Rebirth&quot; Parts 1-3, and most notably, &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, split up and aired in five segments, with Stan Bush&#x27;s music video for &quot;The Touch&quot; included in the final part.

===&quot;Transformers: The Headmasters&quot;===

Rather than import &quot;The Rebirth&quot; as a conclusion, Takara, the Japanese producers of the Transformers toyline, opted instead to continue the Generation 1 universe by creating the full-length 35-episode series, &quot;Transformers: The Headmasters&quot; (two additional clips episodes were produced after the fact for direct-to-video release). Supplanting &quot;The Rebirth&quot;&#x27;s position in Japanese continuity, &quot;The Headmasters&quot; occurred one year after &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime&quot;, introducing the title characters to the Transformers universe in a different way. Whereas in western fiction, the Headmasters result from the merging of a Transformer with an organic alien being from the planet Nebulos, the Headmasters of the Japanese series are a group of small Cybertronians who departed the planet millions of years ago and crash landed on the inhospitable planet Master. To survive its harsh climate, a select few of the most-highly trained constructed larger bodies called &quot;Transtectors,&quot; to which they connected as heads.

When a group of rebellious Headmasters led by Zarak joined with Galvatron&#x27;s Decepticons in an attack on Cybertron, the Autobot Headmasters, led by Fortress returned to their home planet to aid in its defense. The situation soon went from bad to worse when it was revealed that Vector Sigma, the mega-computer at the planet&#x27;s heart, was destabilizing, and Optimus Prime again sacrificed his life to save Cybertron. This soon proved to be only delaying the inevitable, however, when a bomb attack instigated by Zarak turned Cybertron into a burnt-out, inhospitable husk. Rodimus Prime departed to search for a new planet for the Transformers to live on, leaving Fortress in command, operating from the planet Athenia. Meanwhile, Zarak replaced Galvatron - who had vanished in the explosion - as Decepticon leader, constructing a personal Transtector so that he could battle Fortress&#x27;s own giant form, Fortress Maximus, and redubbing himself Scorponok.

Although populated mainly with new characters, &quot;The Headmasters&quot; did continue to feature characters from all previous seasons, including new versions of Soundwave and Blaster, rebuilt after a duel that destroyed them both as Soundblaster and Twincast. Human Daniel Witwicky and his young Autobot friend Wheelie also played major roles in the series, serving as the youthful characters for the audience to identify with. More new characters continued to pour in when Galvatron returned to leadership and the Decepticons embarked on a space voyage, ransacking planets in a chain of stories that introduced the Horrorcons and Autobot and Decepticon Clones. The return to Earth was no less momentous, as the Decepticon ninja six-changer Sixshot killed Ultra Magnus, and the Autobot Headmasters finished off Galvatron. When the Decepticons then returned to Master, refugees from the planet were caught in a plasma bomb accident that fused them to the arms of several Autobots and Decepticons, creating the Targetmasters, and in a final move, Scorponok attempted the destruction of Earth, only to be foiled, thanks in part to a traitorous Sixshot.

Never professionally released in the United States, &quot;The Headmasters&quot; was dubbed into English in Hong Kong for broadcast on the Malaysian TV channel, RTM 1, and later the Singapore satellite station, STAR TV, where it attained greater fame, leading it to often be referred to as the &quot;StarTV dub&quot;. The dub is, however, infamous for its poor quality, full of mistranslations and incorrect names, clearly the work of a small group of individuals (literally, less than half-a-dozen actors fill every role) with little knowledge of the material. This dub has seen some DVD releases in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the entire series was released in a dual-language format in 2005.

On July 5, 2011, Shout! Factory (publishers of G1 of DVD) released the Headmasters series on DVD for the US and Canada markets but the &quot;StarTV&quot; dub wasn&#x27;t included as per Hasbro&#x27;s request.

===&quot;Transformers: Super-God Masterforce&quot;===

The second of the Japanese-exclusive animated series, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Transformers: Super-God Masterforce&quot; takes place some years after &quot;The Headmasters&quot;, introducing the Powermasters and Pretenders to Japanese fiction in ways even more different from their portrayal in the west than those of the Headmasters before them.

With the departure of the Autobots and Decepticons from Earth at the end of &quot;The Headmasters&quot;, a small group of Autobots remained to guard the planet, having hidden amongst mankind for thousands of years thanks to their &quot;Pretender&quot; powers, which allowed them to shrink down and adopt the forms of human beings. However, the sudden re-appearance of their formerly-defeated Decepticon counterparts, now in the service of the mysterious energy entity Devil Z, means that the Autobots must drop their disguises and return to battle once more. But this is only the beginning of the most unusual Transformer war yet - as the battle escalates, human beings themselves take sides, and, imbued with the power of the &quot;Masterforce&quot;, merge with Transtectors sent to Earth by the Autobots in space to become Transformers themselves as the &quot;Headmaster Juniors&quot;. But the Decepticons have Headmaster Juniors of their own, and as the conflict rages, events converge on the creation of the most powerful super-robot lifeforms yet - the Godmasters!

The Godmasters are the Japanese version of the Powermasters, with human beings transforming into engines and combining with Transtectors to transform into robots capable of wielding &quot;Chokon Power&quot;, the primal energy of life. Most notably, their ranks include Ginrai, a character based on the Powermaster version of Optimus Prime, reinvented as a Japanese trucker, and the Japanese-exclusive character, Decepticon ambassador of destruction Overlord.

Running to 42 episodes, &quot;Super-God Masterforce&quot; had six additional clip episodes made after the fact for video release, one of which, serving as an overview of the series, was selected to be broadcast as the 43rd and final episode of the series. The 42 main episodes received the same dub treatment as &quot;The Headmasters&quot;, but the dubbed version of the series was not included on the UK DVD release of the series in July 2006. The Australian version includes the &quot;StarTV&quot; dub on a few early and late episodes in the series.

===&quot;Transformers: Victory&quot;===

Taking place in an unspecified amount of time after the events of &quot;Super-God Masterforce&quot; (there is a common misconception that the series takes place in 2025), 1989&#x27;s &quot;Transformers: Victory&quot; is the third Japanese-exclusive series, the final complete Generation 1 cartoon. Led by their new Supreme Commander Star Saber, the Autobots battle the Decepticons under the command of Deszaras for control of the galaxy&#x27;s resources.

In contrast to &quot;The Headmasters&quot; and &quot;Super-God Masterforce&quot;, both of which had an over-arcing plot direction, the majority of &quot;Victory&quot; is directionless, returning to the episodic adventure tradition of the original American series which culminates in the much-threatened attack of Deszaras&#x27;s planet-destroying fortress. In another difference, the characters and toys of &quot;Victory&quot; are predominantly unique to Japan, and those that are not are remoulded in unique, distinguishing ways - the series debuts the Brainmasters, Brestforce and Multiforce, all new toys, as well as the Dinoforce, remoulded versions of the American Monster Pretenders. Micromasters also make their debut in &quot;Victory&quot;.

Of the 38 episodes of &quot;Victory&quot; broadcast, six are clip episodes containing no new footage, leaving 32 main episodes, which comprise the DVD collection released in the United Kingdom in September 2006. Six further clip episodes were produced for video, taking the total to 44. &quot;Victory&quot; also received the &quot;StarTV dub&quot; treatment - when the three Japanese series were broadcast on StarTV, it was under the umbrella title of &quot;Transformers Takara&quot;, and all three were branded with &quot;Victory&quot;&#x27;s opening sequence. The dub was not released on DVD in the UK either. The Australian release includes the &quot;StarTV&quot; dub for the entire Victory series.

===&quot;Transformers: Zone&quot;===

Originally intended to be a full-length direct-to-video (OVA) series, 1990s &quot;Transformers: Zone&quot; was cancelled after only one episode, making it the last Generation 1 animated project. Following on from &quot;Victory&quot;, the mysterious three-faced insectoid being, Violenjiger dispatches the nine &quot;Great Decepticon Generals&quot; - Devastator, Menasor, Bruticus, Trypticon, Predaking, Abominus, King Poseidon, Overlord and BlackZarak - to acquire &quot;Zone Energy&quot;, destroying the planet Feminia to obtain the world&#x27;s store. Caught in the destruction of the planet, Star Saber is rescued by Dai Atlas, who then repels an attack by the Decepticons, and is appointed the new Autobot commander at the conclusion of the episode.

The cast of Zone is heavily composed of Micromasters, who also made up much of the toyline. Dai Atlas is a &quot;Powered Master&quot;, so named for his motorized gimmick, as is his combining partner Sonic Bomber - the toyline also featured another partner for them, Roadfire, who was not in the episode. The solitary Decepticons in the toyline were the Race Car Patrol, and Metrotitan, a redeco of the Autobot city Metroplex, neither of whom appeared in animated form. They absent parties did go on to appear, however, in the pages of the Japanese publication, TV Magazine - this monthly magazine had always included Transformers manga and &quot;story pages&quot; (splash page illustrations and prose text) from the beginning, and although no manga was released for &quot;Zone&quot; (barring a single chapter available through mail-away which simply re-told the episode), its tale was completed through the story pages.

These story pages were also used to provide supporting fiction for the remaining two years&#x27; worth of toylines - 1991&#x27;s Battlestars: Return of Convoy and 1992&#x27;s Operation: Combination.

Zone is included as a bonus feature on the last disc of the Australian release of Victory with Japanese audio and English subtitles.

==Transformers: Generation 2==

When the &quot;Transformers: Generation 2&quot; toyline fully launched in 1993, it began with a small collection of original Generation 1 toys, redecoed in various ways, and equipped with ostentatious new gimmicks such as electronic sound boxes and large, firing missile launchers. Although the toyline itself would grow to include many brand new figures, and the comic book which accompanied it was a continuation of Marvel&#x27;s Generation 1 title, the &quot;Generation 2&quot; animated series stuck very closely to the toyline&#x27;s opening cascade of &quot;rehashed G1.&quot; Around fifty Generation 1 episodes from seasons 1 to 3 of &quot;The Transformers&quot; were chosen and, as the show&#x27;s narrator proudly proclaimed, &quot;computer-enhanced&quot; with the &quot;Cyber-Net Space-Cube&quot; - a gimmick that essentially consisted of inserting new, computer-generated borders and scene-changes into the existing episodes. CGI clips from toy commercials served to make up the show&#x27;s opening sequence and commercial bumpers, while the episodes themselves were shown in no particular order.

==Beast Era==
===&quot;Beast Wars: Transformers&quot;===

After the unremarkable performance of the &quot;Generation 2&quot; line, Hasbro aimed to completely re-work the Transformers premise; the result was &quot;Beast Wars: Transformers&quot;, which featured robots with familiar names and organic beast modes. As per the original toy packaging bios and mini-comic, the intention was originally to have the series be a direct continuation of the adventures of the &quot;Generation 1&quot; Transformers, but that would soon change with the advent of the animated series. Produced by Canadian animation house Mainframe Entertainment, the animated show was unlike any Transformers cartoons before it, both visually and in terms of story. With Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward at the helm as story editors, it was planned for the show to start afresh, with no ties to anything that had gone before, but the off-handed reference to the &quot;Great War&quot; included in the first episode set the internet fandom ablaze. DiTillio and Forward became occasional posters on the alt.toys.transformers newsgroup, and through this back-and-forth interaction with fans, plus their own research of previous Transformers fiction, the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; animated series soon began to grow, establishing its place as the future - and past - of the larger Generation 1 timeline.

Running to 26 episodes, 1996&#x27;s first season of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; began with an unintentional parallel to the original animated series, introducing the viewers to Maximal Optimus Primal, Predacon Megatron and their crews as their ships crashed onto an alien planet, where they warred over the energon they found there. While mostly a scattershot affair of episodic stories, the first season of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; focused heavily on characterisation, endowing its cast with consistent, developing personalities and naturalistic voice acting that brought the show to life. Additionally, amidst the one-shot adventures, a plot thread began to grow involving a race of mysterious aliens who were conducting experiments on the planet that occasionally intersected with the Beast Warriors&#x27; stories. This eventually culminated in a two-part conclusion to the season, ending on a cliffhanger that led into 1997&#x27;s 13-episode season. Many of the characters were upgraded into new &quot;Transmetal&quot; forms, and the conflict reached a new level with an exceptionally tightly-plotted story arc that included the revelation that the planet was Earth, the death of Dinobot and more alien conflicts. Story elements laid through the season once again came to a head with a three-part conclusion that firmly tied &quot;Beast Wars&quot; to the Generation 1 timeline, featuring guest appearances from Transformers of that era and displaying that the Beast Warriors came from their future, and were currently in the prehistoric past. This link proved key to the third and final season in 1998, running to another 13 episodes, in which the Maximals had to defend their past and future against Megatron&#x27;s attempts to alter history. Longtime Transformers comic scribe Simon Furman was brought on board to script the final episode, which concluded with the end of the Beast Wars, and the Maximal&#x27;s departure for Cybertron.

Although controversial among fans in its early days due to its complete re-imagining of the Transformers concept, today, it is not uncommon to find long-time Transformers fans - even those who have grown up with the franchise since 1984 - who consider &quot;Beast Wars&quot; to be their favorite Transformers series.

===&quot;Beast Wars II&quot;===

Just as with the Generation 1 timeline, Japan was quick to get in on the act when &quot;Beast Wars&quot; took off. The first season of the North American animated series was imported and dubbed with an increase in humor, under the title of &quot;Beast Wars: Super Lifeform Transformers&quot;, but due to the short length of the second season, it proved necessary to wait until both it and the third season were completed before any more could be broadcast. In order to fill the ensuing gap, 1997 debuted the Japanese-original cel-animated series, the 43-episode &quot;Beast Wars II&quot; (also known as &quot;Beast Wars Second&quot; or &quot;Beast Wars The Second&quot;). The series featured an entirely new cast of Maximals and Predacons - led by Lio Convoy and Galvatron, respectively - fighting on the planet Gaia - a &quot;future&quot; Earth, devastated by the power of the energy source the two factions seek, Angolmois energy.

Although largely looked down upon for its very light-hearted approach when compared to the darker North American series, &quot;Beast Wars II&quot; proved successful enough to spawn a theatrical movie, consisting of three &quot;acts&quot;. The first act was a recap of the original &quot;Beast Wars&quot; television show up to that point, while the second was the undubbed, English-language episode, &quot;Bad Spark&quot;, from the show&#x27;s second season, to serve as a showcase for the upcoming release of the season in Japan. The third act was &quot;Lio Convoy, Close Call!&quot;, a new, original story that saw Optimus Primal pulled forward in time to team up with Lio Convoy to stop the monstrous Majin Zarak.

===&quot;Beast Wars Neo&quot;===

Even after the conclusion of &quot;Beast Wars II&quot;, there was still some time to go before the North American series had generated enough episodes to be aired in Japan, and the 35-episode &quot;Beast Wars Neo&quot; was produced to fill the 1998 gap. Still cel-animated and ostensibly even &quot;more&quot; light-hearted than &quot;Beast Wars II&quot;, this series introduced Big Convoy and Magmatron, new Maximal and Predacon leaders, the former in search of the missing Lio Convoy, the latter questing for the capsule that Lio Convoy had sealed the Angolmois Energy into at the conclusion of the previous series. &quot;Beast Wars Neo&quot; is particularly notable for one reason - it features the first return of Unicron to animated continuity for a decade. In the course of the series, Angolmois Energy is revealed to be Unicron&#x27;s life-force, and the series leads to his attempt to transfer it into Cybertron, that it may become his new body.

With the end of &quot;Beast Wars Neo&quot;, the third season of the North American series had been completed, and it was subsequently combined with the second season and dubbed for Japanese release as &quot;Beast Wars Metals&quot;.

===&quot;Beast Machines&quot;===

As controversial as &quot;Beast Wars&quot; started out, it was nothing compared to the controversy that would result from the infamous &quot;Beast Machines&quot;. The series was the only Transformers animated series to be fully plotted from start to finish by Marty Isenberg and Robert N. Skir, writers unfamiliar with Transformers lore who sought to produce the series as, in Skir&#x27;s words, a &quot;religious epic novel for television&quot;. The series tackled the heavy philosophical concept of what it meant to live in an increasingly technological society, running to 26 episodes over two seasons, though in its native Canada, the show was aired simply in one long 26-episode run.

As &quot;Beast Machines&quot; begins, viewers rejoin Optimus Primal and his Maximals as they return to Cybertron, amnesiac and unable to recall how they got there, only to discover that the planet is now under Megatron&#x27;s rule, its cities deserted, its occupants stripped of their sparks. An encounter with the ancient Cybertronian computer, the Oracle, sees them reformatted into new technorganic bodies that blend their mechanical natures with the organic material they acquired on Earth, and as the story of the show develops, an organic past to Cybertron is steadily revealed, as is the story of the Maximal&#x27;s missing memories and friends. Influences from the original Transformers began to creep into the show as they had with &quot;Beast Wars&quot; before it, until more obscure concepts such as the key to Vector Sigma and the Plasma Energy Chamber played major roles in the series, each one exemplifying one of the mantras espoused - Primal&#x27;s dedication to seeing the organic flourish, and Megatron&#x27;s desire for unfeeling, unthinking technological perfection. The clash between these two powers marked the end of the first season, and served to provide Primal with the revelation that drove the second - that he had been wrong, and that the Oracle desired not the domination of one power over the other, but a balance between the organic and the technological. The second season of the show dove headlong into the storyline, with Megatron body-swapping repeatedly, and the concept of the show allowing for such left-field creations as an entirely organic Transformer that changed from beast to beast, and a Maximal who transformed into a plant. The series concluded with a drawn-out battle between Primal and Megatron, which ultimately concluded with their deaths, allowing the planet-wide reformatting of Cybertron into a technorganic paradise.

&quot;Beast Machines&quot; was not exported to Japan for several years, finally reaching the country in 2004 under the title of &quot;Beast Wars Returns&quot;.

==&quot;Transformers: Robots in Disguise&quot; (2000 series)==

After the conclusion of &quot;Beast Wars Metals&quot;, it was necessary for Takara to once again produce an original Transformers animated series and toyline, as &quot;Beast Machines&quot; had not yet amassed enough episodes to make importing it viable. To that end, the new cel-animated series &quot;Transformers: Car Robots&quot; (occasionally referred to by the misnomer, &quot;Transformers 2000&quot;) was produced for broadcast in Japan for 2000. The series, however, ultimately proved duly unsuccessful (to the extent that there was no Transformers animated series broadcast in Japan in 2001) and following both the conclusion of it and the second season of &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, Takara and Hasbro opted to co-produce the next series for the first time. With this decision made, Hasbro scrapped their plans for the &quot;Transtech&quot; series, and - rather than go a year without Transformers, as Takara had chosen to do - opted to import &quot;Car Robots&quot; for the 2001 year.

Renamed &quot;Transformers: Robots in Disguise&quot; (regularly referred to with the acronym of &quot;RiD&quot; by fans) the series stands alone, unconnected to any of the previous continuities as a complete, self-contained universe. Conceptually, the show united ideas from across the G1 and Beast eras by pitting the vehicular Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, against the bestial Predacons, led by Megatron, and through the inclusion of classic concepts such as Headmaster and combining technology, dubbed into English by Saban Entertainment, many fan-friendly references to the previous continuities were also added. The first story arc of the series is a series of episodic adventures introducing the majority of the cast - like the original animated series, it was very Autobot-heavy, with most characters being newly designed (bar the Spy Changers, repainted versions of &quot;Generation 2&quot; figures, and Tow-Line and Skid-Z, repainted &quot;Machine Wars&quot; toys), while on the Predacon side, only Megatron was a new mould, with his troops being repaints of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; Transmetal 2 toys. The trend continued into the second story arc, which introduced &quot;RiD&quot;&#x27;s version of the Decepticons - redecos of the G1 Combaticons and G2 &quot;Laser Optimus Prime&quot; toy - and Optimus Prime&#x27;s bitter brother, Ultra Magnus. This led smoothly into the third and final arc of the show, which saw Magnus and Prime merge into Omega Prime, and Decepticon leader Scourge began his plot to wrest the power of the ancient battle station, Fortress Maximus, away from both Megatron and the Autobots.

Its airing schedule heavily disrupted by the 9/11 event, &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; had to be re-edited in several ways for content, and several of its episodes aired out of order, or not at all in America. Although initially derided by some fans for its especially light-hearted, joke-filled nature, demand is high for the series to be released on DVD in North America, although available in the United Kingdom, it has yet to see a release in America due to the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s acquisition of Saban and its products.

==Unicron Trilogy==
The &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot; is so-named for the major role that the chaos bringer Unicron plays in each of the three series that comprise it. Taking place over a twenty year span from 2010 to 2030, the trilogy is significant for being a co-production between Hasbro and Takara; the Japanese production team actually wanted to set the series in the Generation 1 continuity, post-&quot;The Rebirth&quot;, but this was vetoed by Hasbro&#x27;s head Transformers design director, Aaron Archer, in favour of completely rebooting the Transformers universe and introducing a brand new continuity for the second time (the first being &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot;). Archer crafted the basic story outline of each of the three lines, with the anime themselves then being written and animated in Japan, but in practice, the Japanese studios did not always follow Archer&#x27;s design. While each series ran for eighteen months in Hasbro markets, lasting from mid-2002 through 2007, the three were annual affairs in Japan, running from January to December in 2003, 2004 and 2005.

===&quot;Transformers: Armada&quot;===

Launched in the summer of 2002, &quot;Transformers: Armada&quot; was the first series co-produced between Hasbro and Takara, with the intention of creating a toyline for simultaneous release in both North America and Japan. It was released in Japan six months later in January 2003, where it was known as Transformers: Micron Legend. The heavily promoted series was an attempt to re-introduce Transformers to the children of the time, and featured a particularly large number of additional merchandise such as puzzles, games, cards, candy and a tie-in PlayStation 2 video game.

In addition to drawing on and re-imagining familiar elements from Generation 1, such as the Matrix of Leadership, &quot;Armada&quot;&#x27;s defining trait was the introduction of a third faction of Transformers - the diminutive robots known as Mini-Cons (the eponymous &quot;Microns&quot; in Japan). Mini-Cons can &quot;powerlink&quot; to larger Transformers, increasing their powers, and consequently became a sought-after commodity in the war between the Autobots and Decepticons. Eventually, however, the Mini-Cons fled Cybertron in a starship, which warped into the Solar system and crashed on Earth. The series then begins in the year 2010, when three teenagers - Rad, Carlos and Alexis - find and reactivate the buried hulk of the Mini-Con ship, sending out a signal that brings Optimus Prime, Megatron and their troops to Earth.

The Autobots and Decepticons begin scouring the planet to find the stasis panels containing the dormant Mini-Cons, thought to be located in Hellnoville, but soon, the existence of three powerful weapons - each formed from the fusion of three separate Mini-Cons - comes to light. Thanks to the schemes of the mysterious, allegiance-shifting Sideways, the weapons are formed and constantly shift hands, until, through manipulation of the self-doubting Starscream, all three are finally within Decepticon hands. Through the power of these weapons, the ancient evil, Unicron is reawakened, as the mysteries of the show, the origins of the Mini-Cons and the nature of the Transformers&#x27; war are explored in a final story arc entitled &quot;The Unicron Battles.&quot;

The English-language version of &quot;Armada&quot; is infamous for having been produced in haste for several reasons, most prominently the fact that Cartoon Network would not sign off on the series without a certain number of episodes already completed. To meet this demand, the dubbing studio was forced to work with only partially complete episodes, with animation of a wildly varying quality, containing many errors that were later corrected for the Japanese broadcast. Additionally, there was rarely even enough time to produce more than a first draft of the translated script, leading to many errors in translation making it into the finished product, including incorrect character names, flat, transliterated speech, and at times, utterly nonsensical dialogue that did not match the action onscreen.

A companion comic book was included with the Japanese DVD releases of the series titled &quot;Linkage&quot;, which focused on the side story of a group of Mini-Cons whose adventures happened concurrently with the animated series. The comic takes the time to flesh out some unexplained plot points from the series, as well as providing an in-depth explanation on the nature of Mini-Cons.

===&quot;Transformers: Energon&quot;===

Whatever the technical failings of the &quot;Armada&quot; animated series, the line succeeded in its goal of reinvigorating the Transformers brand and reacquiring the recognisability the series had enjoyed in the Generation 1 heyday. Consequently, the process was repeated, and Hasbro and Takara debuted &quot;Transformers: Energon&quot; at the beginning of 2004.

Picking up ten years after the end of &quot;Armada&quot;, &quot;Energon&quot; focuses on the quest for the titular energy-rich mineral, the Transformers&#x27; power source. The Autobots and Decepticons, allied since the conclusion of &quot;Armada&quot;, have entered into an alliance with humankind in order to mine for energon on Earth, and now operate out of massive &quot;Cybertron Cities&quot; in strategic locations around the world. But, out in the void of space, the damaged, deactivated body of Unicron now serves the staging base of the deranged alien being Alpha Q, who sends armies of robotic Terrorcons to steal Energon for his own purposes. But those purposes are not as sinister as they seem, and soon pale in comparison to the evil of the resurrected Megatron.

The Autobots of &quot;Energon&quot; are empowered with the &quot;Spark of Combination&quot;, which allows them to link their bodies together in various configurations - a power that gives the series its Japanese title, Transformers: Superlink - while the Decepticons possess &quot;hyper modes&quot; with excesses of weaponry. The series also introduces the aforementioned Terrorcons, and their Autobot counterparts the Omnicons, robots with the ability to handle and shape energon into power-enhancing stars and weapons such as spears and axes.

===&quot;Transformers: Cybertron&quot;===

&quot;Transformers: Cybertron&quot; is the anomaly of the Unicron Trilogy universe. Debuting in Japan in January 2005, under the title Transformers: Galaxy Force, the series was intended by its Japanese producers to be yet another complete reboot to the timeline, beginning yet another continuity from the beginning with no connections to &quot;Armada&quot; or &quot;Energon&quot;. It would not be until mid-2005, when &quot;Energon&quot; completed its run, that Hasbro would release &quot;Cybertron&quot; into their markets, modifying the show and using other media to establish its place in continuity (see the show&#x27;s own article for more details). Concluding in Japan at the end of 2005, the series ran throughout 2006 in Hasbro markets, and once again, Takara had no animated product on Japanese screens for that year.

The story of &quot;Cybertron&quot; centres on a gigantic black hole, created by the destruction of Unicron at the conclusion of &quot;Energon&quot;, which threatens to consume Cybertron and the rest of the universe. This danger brings the ancient Transformer, Vector Prime, back to Cybertron, where he sets the Autobots on a quest for the four Cyber Planet Keys, legendary artifacts of power that can seal the black hole. The keys, however, are scattered on planets throughout the galaxy, and the Autobots must now race from world to world to acquire their power before the Decepticons. Aided with new &quot;Cyber Key Powers&quot; of their own, the Transformers makes allies and enemies on each different world they visit, from the racing-obsessed Velocitron to the bestial Jungle Planet and beyond, on an adventure that has its roots in the ancient past, and sculpts a new future for Cybertron.

&quot;Cybertron&quot;&#x27;s English language adaptation flouts Unicron Trilogy convention by being competently produced. More than simply a translation of the Japanese version, &quot;Cybertron&quot; features large amounts of new dialogue, be it to form connections with &quot;Armada&quot; and &quot;Energon&quot;, to pay homage to many classic Generation 1 quotes (several lines from &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; are re-used, in particular, and there are also a few quotes and references to the Beast Era), or simply to fill many prolonged sequences of silence in the Japanese version, an artefact of the show&#x27;s excessive use of stock footage transformation, combination and transportation sequences.

==&quot;Transformers: Animated&quot;==

Formerly known by the working title, &quot;Transformers: Heroes&quot;, &quot;Transformers: Animated&quot; debuted December 26, 2007, on Cartoon Network, and represents yet another fresh start for the animated Transformers universe, albeit one that draws inspiration from many of its antecedents, including, for the first time, elements drawn from the 2007 live-action film. Opening in a manner similar to &quot;Beast Wars&quot;, the series takes place centuries after the end of the Autobot-Decepticon war, and centers on a small group of Autobots voyaging through space on missions. The group is a Space Bridge repair crew led by academy washout Optimus Prime, who stumble across the legendary life-giving Allspark on a routine mission, drawing the attention of the long-exiled Decepticons under the command of Megatron. As a result of the ensuing battle, Megatron and the Autobots crash land on Earth, while the other Decepticons are scattered through space. Megatron&#x27;s remains are discovered by the young scientist Isaac Sumdac, who reverse-engineers his Cybertronian technology to create massive leaps in Earth machinery, transforming the planet into a technological utopia over the course of the following fifty years. The Autobots spend these years in stasis, but when they are awakened as a result of one of Sumdac&#x27;s experiments in techno-organic fusion going berserk, they publicly save the day, befriend Sumdac&#x27;s daughter Sari (who later reveals to be a robot herself), and quickly establish themselves as a force for justice on Earth.

The core Autobot team is led by Optimus Prime (voiced by David Kaye, famous for voicing the Megatrons of the Beast Era and Unicron Trilogy) and consists of the speedy, wise-cracking Bumblebee; gentle giant Bulkhead; aged, ornery medic Ratchet; and loner ninja Prowl. Early antagonists in the series will be superhuman villains, some of whom will obtain powers through Transformer technology, with the scattered Decepticons (Starscream, Blackarachnia, Lugnut, and Blitzwing) periodically arriving on Earth in their search for Megatron and the Allspark. The series also features many other additional Transformers characters in guest appearances and recurring roles, including Arcee, Ironhide, bounty hunter Lockdown, Earth machines brought to life by the Allspark such as the Dinobots, the Constructicons, and Wreck-Gar, and the Autobot Cybertron Elite Guard, including Ultra Magnus (Supreme Commander of the Autobots), Sentinel Prime, Blurr, and Jazz.

The show&#x27;s supervising director is Matt Youngberg (&quot;Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot;), with Cartoon Network vice-president Sam Register as executive producer and Vincent Aniceto as line producer. &quot;Beast Machines&quot; writer Marty Isenberg returned to &quot;Transformers&quot; as the story editor/head writer for this series, and it is voice-directed by Susan Blu, the original voice of G1 Arcee, who will be voicing the character again in this series. Art director/lead character designer Derrick J Wyatt (&quot;Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;) has created a &quot;brand new look&quot; unlike anything seen in &quot;Transformers&quot; before. The series is being distributed internationally by Entertainment Rights.

==&quot;Aligned&quot; continuity==
===&quot;Transformers: Prime&quot; (2010–2013)===

&quot;Transformers: Prime&quot; is a CGI-based series that aired on The Hub television network from November 29, 2010 to July 26, 2013, with Peter Cullen and Frank Welker once again providing the voices of Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively. The series begins three years after the Autobot&#x27;s last confrontation with the Decepticons. After Cybertron became uninhabitable due to the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, the Autobots scattered across the Universe. Optimus Prime is on Earth with a small group of Autobots that call themselves Team Prime.

While the Autobot&#x27;s presence is not known among the general population, the United States government is aware of their presence and cooperates with them. A special agent named William Fowler often communicates with the Autobots directly. Megatron discovers that Optimus is on Earth and seeks him out to destroy him. Megatron also realises that Earth is rich with sources of Energon, and the Autobots strive to stop him from destroying Earth as he searches for these sources. Energon is the emanation of Primus, the creator of the Transformers, and it functions in transformers as blood does in humans. Dark Energon, on the other hand, is a corrupted form of energon and the blood of Unicron the Chaos-Bringer, Primus&#x27;s fallen brother. Primus makes up the core of Cybertron, and it is eventually revealed that Unicron makes up the Earth&#x27;s core. Megatron injects himself with Dark energon in order to gain control over it and become stronger. Dark energon weakens and corrupts transformers, and it can be used to raise the dead, which Megatron does in the beginning of the series.

In the very beginning of the series, three teenagers named Jack, Miko and Rafael witness the Autobots and Decepticons in action. Now that they are involved, the Autobots take it upon themselves to protect them. These teenagers become great friends to the Autobots, as well as a great asset, providing them with useful information about human life and Earth. They become involved in many of the Autobots&#x27; adventures.

The series concluded with the television film &quot;Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising&quot;, on October 4, 2013.

===&quot;Transformers: Rescue Bots&quot; (2012–2016)===

&quot;Transformers: Rescue Bots&quot; is an animated series airing on The Hub and aimed at a younger generation of &quot;Transformers&quot; fans. It is part of the same continuity as &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;. The series focuses on a squad of Rescue Bots, Autobots who specialized in rescue missions back on Cybertron. Having left Cybertron on a patrol ship prior to the war between Autobots and Decepticons, they eventually arrive on Earth and meet Optimus Prime, who pairs them up with the Burns family of the fictional island Griffin Rock. The Rescue Bots are tasked with helping protect the citizens of Griffin Rock while learning from them and maintaining their cover as highly sophisticated-but nonsentient-transforming robots. The Burns serve as their partners in this endeavor, with each Rescue Bot teaming up with an adult Burns family member while the youngest Burns, Cody, helps the Bots learn more about Earth culture. While they are usually called upon to defend Griffin Rock and its citizens from man-made and natural disasters, the Rescue Bots occasionally engage human villains eager to exploit their advanced technology.

At four seasons and 104 episodes, it is the longest-running &quot;Transformers&quot; series, surpassing the record set by the original animated series at 98 episodes.

===&quot;Transformers Go!&quot; (2013–2014)===
&quot;Transformers Go!&quot; is a Japanese exclusive sequel to &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot; - &quot;Beast Hunters&quot;. There are two chapters: &quot;Samurai&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot;. Both, however, share the same basic plot. Two humans, one descended from a line of samurai and one from ninjas, encounter the Predacons who are attempting to steal the legendiscs-powerful ancient artifacts-to revive their leader, Dragotron. However, the discs summon two teams of Autobot Swordbots, each corresponding to the human partner&#x27;s ancestry. From then on, with the help of Optimus Prime, they combat the Predacons while attempting to retrieve all the legendiscs.

===&quot;Transformers: Robots in Disguise&quot; (2015–2017)===
&quot;&quot; is a sequel series to &quot;&quot;, and it ran from March 14, 2015 to November 11, 2017. Years after the conclusion of &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;, Bumblebee leads his own team of Autobots, including Sideswipe, a Mini-Con named Fixit, the Dinobot Grimlock and a female Elite Guard cadet named Strongarm. The Autobots are summoned back to Earth to defend it from a new faction of Decepticons.

===&quot;Transformers: Rescue Bots Academy&quot; (2019–2021)===

&quot;&quot; is the sequel series to &quot;&quot;, aimed at a younger audience than its predecessor. After a sneak peek on December 8, 2018, the series officially premiered on January 8, 2019 on Discovery Family.

The series focuses on Hot Shot, Whirl, Hoist, Medix and Wedge, five young Cybertronians who enroll as the first students of the Rescue Bots Training Center, where they learn from the now-famous original Rescue Bots how to respond in emergency situations and become true heroes.

==&quot;Mystery of Convoy&quot;==
In collaboration with the 30th anniversary of &quot;Transfomers&quot;, as well as the 35th anniversary of &quot;Choro-Q&quot;, a flash anime adaptation of the game, produced by DLE, titled , began airing in Japan on January 6, 2015.

It aired from November 14, 2017 to January 9, 2018 and features Peter Cullen and Judd Nelson as Optimus Prime and Hot Rod, reprising their respective characters from &quot;The Transformers&quot; 30 years previous.

===&quot;Transformers: Power of the Primes&quot; (2018 series)===

Like &quot;Combiner Wars&quot; and &quot;Titans Return&quot;, &quot;&quot; is also an Internet-based series for go90 and is also the final installment of the Prime Wars Trilogy, supporting the Power of the Primes toyline. It aired from May 1, 2018 to July 3, 2018.

==&quot;Transformers: Cyberverse&quot;==

Debuting in 2018 on Cartoon Network and produced by Boulder Media Limited and Hasbro&#x27;s Allspark Animation, &quot;&quot; is a series where Bumblebee lost his memory of the special mission given to him by Optimus Prime. With the help of his friend, Windblade, they will encounter challenges to recover Bumblebee&#x27;s memory.

The seasons are dubbed &quot;Chapters&quot;, with the first aired in 2018, the second, subtitled &quot;Power of the Spark&quot;, aired in 2019–2020 and the third and final chapter, in which the show&#x27;s title changed into &quot;Transformers: Bumblebee: Cyberverse Adventures&quot;, was aired in 2020. The series concluded with two extended-length Netflix television specials in 2021.

The show uses elements and characters across all eras of the franchise, specifically G1, &quot;Animated&quot;, Aligned and the live-action films continuities. It is, however, the first stand-alone &quot;Transformers&quot; show not connected to any larger continuity since &quot;&quot;.

==&quot;Transformers: War for Cybertron Trilogy&quot;==

&quot;&quot; is a CGI anime-influenced animation series that was first released on Netflix on July 30, 2020.

F.J. DeSanto, the showrunner of the &quot;Prime Wars Trilogy&quot; animated series, returns in the same position, alongside writers George Krstic, Gavin Hignight and Brandon M. Easton and voice actors Jake Foushee, Jason Marnocha and Frank Todaro reprising their roles as Optimus Prime, Megatron and Starscream.

<doc id="811550" wikidata="Q2088106" url="?curid=811550" title="Over-the-air update">
<text>An over-the-air update (or OTA update), also known as over-the-air programming (or OTA programming), is an update to an embedded system that is delivered through a wireless network, such as Wi-Fi or a cellular network. 
These embedded systems include mobile phones, tablets, set-top boxes, cars and telecommunications equipment. 
OTA updates for cars and internet of things devices can also be called firmware over-the-air (FOTA). 
Various components may be updated OTA, including the device&#x27;s operating system, applications, configuration settings, or parameters like encryption keys. 

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;over-the-air update&quot; applies specifically to embedded systems, rather than non-embedded systems like computers. Before OTA updates, embedded devices could only be flashed through direct physical access (with a JTAG) or wired connections (usually through USB or a serial port).

== Purpose ==

Over-the-air delivery may allow updates to be distributed at larger scales, reduce the cost of delivering updates, or increase the rate of adoption of these updates.

== Implementation ==
The distributor of these updates can decide whether users are allowed to decline these updates, and may choose to disable certain features on end-user devices until an update is applied. Users may be unable to revert an update after it is installed.

OTA updates are designed to be as small as possible in order to minimize energy consumption, network usage, and storage space. This is achieved by only transferring the differences between the old firmware and the new firmware, rather than transmitting the entire firmware. A delta of the old and new firmware is produced through a process called diffing; then, the delta file is distributed to the end-device, which uses the delta file to update itself.

== Industries ==

=== Smartphones ===
On smartphones, tablets, and other devices, an over-the-air update is a firmware or operating system update that is downloaded by the device over the internet. Previously, users had to connect these devices to a computer over USB to perform an update. These updates may add features, patch security vulnerabilities, or fix software bugs. The two main mobile operating systems are iOS and Android.

iOS gained support for over-the-air updates in iOS 5. iOS updates are distributed exclusively by Apple, resulting in wide availability and relatively high adoption rates. Major iOS releases are usually installed on 60%–70% of iPhones within a few months of the update&#x27;s release.

Android OTA updates are not distributed directly by Google, but by OEMs (like Samsung) and wireless carriers. This has led to inconsistent availability of updates, and to Android fragmentation. In the past, fragmentation increased the complexity of developing third-party apps for Android (due to inconsistent availability of the latest software frameworks on users&#x27; phones), and led to security concerns due to delays in the distribution of security updates. Google has reduced Android fragmentation through the 2017 Project Treble, which allows OEMs to release OS updates without needing to re-test hardware drivers for each version, and the 2019 Project Mainline, which allows Google to update Android components and deliver security patches through its Play Store, without requiring a full OS update. Project Mainline significantly lowers the role of middlemen in delivering OTA updates. Since Android 8.0, Android OTA updates follow an A/B partition scheme, in which an update is installed to a second (&quot;B&quot;) partition in the background, and the phone switches to that partition the next time it is rebooted; this reduces the time taken to install updates.

=== Automotive ===
Cars can support OTA updates to their in-car entertainment system, navigation map, telematic control unit, or their electronic control units (the onboard computers responsible for most of the car&#x27;s operation). In cars, the telematic control unit is in charge of downloading and installing updates, and OTA updates are downloaded through cellular networks, like smartphones. Cars cannot be driven while an OTA update is being installed. Before an update, the car checks that the update is genuine, and after the update completes, it verifies the integrity of all affected systems.

OTA updates provide several benefits. In the past, Volkswagen had to recall 11 million vehicles to fix an issue with its cars&#x27; emissions control software, and other manufacturers have instituted recalls due to software bugs affecting the brakes, or the airbags, requiring all affected customers to travel to dealership to receive updates. OTA updates would have removed the need to go through dealerships, leading to lower warranty costs for manufacturers and lower downtime for customers. OTA updates also allow manufacturers to deploy potential new features and bug fixes more quickly, making their cars more competitive in the market, and resulting in an increased pace of product improvements for consumers. For example, OTA updates can deliver improvements to a car&#x27;s driver assistance systems and improve the car&#x27;s safety.

However, OTA updates can also present a new attack vector for hackers, since security vulnerabilities in the update process could be used by hackers to remotely take control of cars. Hackers have discovered such vulnerabilities in the past, and many car manufacturers have responded by instituting vulnerability disclosure programs ( bug bounty programs). Attack vectors specific to OTA updates include &quot;spoofing, tampering, repudiation [attacks], information leakage, denial-of-service,&quot; replay attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. Example scenarios include a hacker successfully interrupting an ongoing update (deemed a &quot;flashing fail&quot;), which may corrupt the car&#x27;s computer systems and make the car malfunction later on; another scenario is &quot;arbitrary flashings&quot;, in which hackers trick the car into installing a malicious OTA update.

=== Internet of things (IoT) ===
More recently, with the new concepts of Wireless Sensor Networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), where the networks consist of hundreds or thousands of nodes, OTA is taken to a new direction: for the first time OTA is applied using unlicensed frequency bands (868 MHz, 900 MHz, 2400 MHz) and with low consumption and low data rate transmission using protocols such as 802.15.4 and Zigbee.

Sensor nodes are often located in places that are either remote or difficult to access. As an example, Libelium has implemented an OTA programming system for Zigbee WSN devices. This system enables firmware upgrades without the need of physical access, saving time and money if the nodes must be re-programmed.

=== Internet routers ===
OTA is similar to firmware distribution methods used by other mass-produced consumer electronics, such as cable modems, which use TFTP as a way to remotely receive new programming, thus reducing the amount of time spent by both the owner and the user of the device on maintenance.

Over-the-air provisioning (OTAP) is also available in wireless environments (though it is disabled by default for security reasons). It allows an access point (AP) to discover the IP address of its controller. When enabled, the controller tells the other APs to include additional information in the Radio Resource Management Packets (RRM) that would assist a new access point in learning of the controller. It is sent in plain text however, which would make it vulnerable to sniffing. That is why it is disabled by default.
=== Cellular networks ===

Over-the-air provisioning (OTAP) is a form of OTA update by which cellular network operators can remotely provision a mobile phone (termed a &quot;client&quot; or &quot;mobile station&quot; in industry parlance) and update the cellular network settings stored on its SIM card. This can occur at any time while a phone is turned on. The term &quot;over-the-air parameter administration&quot; (OTAPA) is synonymous. OTA provisioning allows mobile phones to remain properly configured when cellular network operators make changes to their networks. It also configures phones with the settings required to access certain features, like WAP (an early incarnation of the mobile web), MMS messaging, and cellular data (which requires the configuration of an Access Point Name).

The similar term &quot;over-the-air service provisioning&quot; (OTASP) specifically refers to the wireless initial provisioning (&quot;activation&quot;) of a phone. During activation, a mobile phone is provisioned with parameters like its phone number, mobile identification number, and system ID, granting it initial access to the cellular network. OTASP is sometimes called &quot;over-the-air activation&quot; or &quot;over-the-air bootstrapping&quot;. The alternative to OTA bootstrapping is SIM bootstrapping, where the phone reads the network settings stored on a SIM card. SIM bootstrapping has limitations: settings stored on a SIM card may become stale between the time the SIM is manufactured and the time it is used; also, some phones (and other cellular client equipment) do not use SIM cards.

Various standards bodies have issued OTA provisioning standards. In 2001, the WAP Forum published the WAP Client Provisioning standard. After the Open Mobile Alliance subsumed the WAP Forum, this standard became known as OMA Client Provisioning (OMA CP). In OMA CP, phones are provisioned by &quot;invisible&quot; SMS messages sent by the cellular network, which contain the requisite settings. OMA CP was followed by a newer standard, OMA Device Management (OMA DM), which use a different form of SMS-based provisioning (called &quot;OMA Push&quot;). OMA DM sessions are always client-initiated. The &quot;invisible&quot; SMS does not contain configuration settings; instead, it tells the phone (the &quot;DM Client&quot;) to connect to a DM Server (operated by the cellular network provider); once connected, the DM Server sends configuration commands to the client.

==OTA standards==
There are a number of standards that describe OTA functions. One of the first was the GSM 03.48 series. The Zigbee suite of standards includes the Zigbee Over-the-Air Upgrading Cluster which is part of the Zigbee Smart Energy Profile and provides an interoperable (vendor-independent) way of updating device firmware.
