==Early life==
Frostrup was born in Oslo, Norway, to Peter and Joan Frostrup, but moved with her family when she was six to Ireland in 1969, living in Kilmacanogue, a small village near the town of Greystones in County Wicklow. Her Norwegian father, who died aged 44 when Frostrup was 15, was a journalist (including Foreign Editor) on &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and her Scottish mother an artist. She has four siblings.

After the death of her father, in 1977 she moved to London. to work in the music industry. Following a period training to be a tape op for the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio (during which she worked with Simple Minds on their &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot; album), she went on to work as a public relations executive for Phonogram Records between 1980 and 1990; coordinated the publicity for the Live Aid concert at Wembley in 1985; and, after leaving Phonogram, started television work as a presenter and film critic.

==Advocacy==
Frostrup&#x27;s political views have been described as &quot;a bit left-of-centre&quot;. She has been active in the charity sector for two decades, having worked on Bank Aid and Comic Relief along with various fundraising initiatives for Oxfam, The Children&#x27;s Society and Save the Children. Campaigning for women&#x27;s rights and gender equality has become her main focus; she has recently made several trips to Africa to meet women and young girls in their communities, and experience first hand the realities and inequalities of the lives that they lead.

In 2010 she created, along with three other trustees, the Gender Rights and Equality Action Trust. This foundation aims at fostering gender equality and raising awareness and funds, to support grass roots gender equality projects in Africa and beyond. The GREAT Initiative works in partnership with Femmes Africa Solidarité, an African charity.

In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the African Union in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.

In 2021 she became President of the Somerset branch of CPRE, the Countryside Charity.

In 2022 she founded Menopause Mandate with Davina McCall, Penny Lancaster and others, to campaign for greater awareness of the impact of the menopause.
In 2024 she was appointed Government Menopause Employment Ambassador

<text>Thomas Andrews (30 June 1811 – 19 June 1871) was a British metallurgist of international renown.

In 1850 Andrews, Samuel Burrows and John Burrows, trading as Andrews, Burrows and Co. took over the works at Wortley. Andrews&#x27; experiments on metal fatigue and fracture at Wortley Top Forge led to the manufacture of railway axles of internationally reputed quality.

After his death in 1871 his son Thomas Andrews (1847–1907) took an active part in running the forges.

<text>The Reverend Robert Main (12 July 1808 – 9 May 1878) was an English astronomer.

==Life==
Born at Upnor in Kent, he was the eldest son of Thomas Main; Thomas John Main the mathematician was a younger brother. Robert Main attended school in Portsea, Portsmouth before studying mathematics at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he graduated as sixth wrangler in 1834. He served for twenty-five years (1835–60) as First Assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and published numerous articles, particularly on stellar and planetary motion, stellar parallax, and the dimensions and shapes of the planets. From 1841 to 1861 he was successively an honorary secretary, a vice-president, and President of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 1858 was awarded the Society&#x27;s Gold Medal. In 1860 he became director of Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford University after the death of Manuel Johnson, and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society. An ordained priest of the Church of England, he preached regularly while living in Greenwich.

Main completed the questionnaire on which Francis Galton based his &quot;English Men of Science&quot; (1874), and his recorded answers included the following comments:

:&quot;I take considerable pains in the investigation of religious matters, one of my amusements being the collection of a considerable theological library, with the books of which I am familiar.&quot;
:&quot;I am not aware of any innate taste for science... My interest in astronomy, especially, was very small indeed until I was appointed.&quot;

==Works==
Main supervised the third (1859) edition of Sir John Herschel&#x27;s &quot;A Manual of Scientific Enquiry, prepared for the use of Her Majesty&#x27;s Navy and adapted for travellers in general&quot; (1849), which included an article on geology by Charles Darwin. His textbook &quot;Rudimentary Astronomy&quot; appeared in 1852, a second astronomical book, &quot;Practical and Spherical Astronomy&quot; was published in 1863. He was responsible for editing the Second Radcliffe Catalogue (1870), which detailed 6,317 stars, and (with Charles Pritchard) Herschel&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of 10,300 multiple and double stars&quot; (1874). He also published observations made of rainfall in Oxford over 25 years from 1851 to 1875, and contributed to the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; during the editorship of G. H. Lewes.

His other works include the annual address for 1875 to the Philosophical Society at the Victoria Institute (entitled &quot;Modern Philosophic Scepticism Examined&quot;) and a sermon on I Corinthians 1:22-24 given to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in the same year.

==Legacy==
The lunar crater Main is named after Robert Main, and there is also a crater on Mars named after him.

<text>Air South was a low-cost airline from the United States, headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina. Between 1994 and 1997, it offered domestic flights mainly serving the southeast of the country. For a time, a partnership with Kiwi International Air Lines was maintained.

==History==
The company was founded in 1993, though the first aircraft, a used Boeing 737-200, arrived with Air South on 12 July 1994. Over the following months, additional aging 737-200s were added (all of them had been delivered to their original operators between 1968 and 1979), and by 1995, the fleet had grown to a total of seven airliners. The initial business model of Air South in the first year of operation showed a modest profit, however after  management changes and a refocusing on new airline routes, the airline failed and went bankrupt.

==Destinations==
Air South offered scheduled flights to the following destinations during its existence with its small fleet of Boeing 737-200 jetliners:

<doc id="794638" wikidata="Q8037286" url="?curid=794638" title="Wortley Top Forge">
<text>Wortley Top Forge is an historic former finery forge and ironworks originally dating back to the seventeenth century, although evidence suggests iron working took place in the vicinity as early as the fourteenth century. It is situated in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, England, on a loop of the River Don near the village of Wortley.

The Top Forge was always closely related to Wortley Low Forge, a short distance . One of the forges was probably built about 1639 (possibly both of them) and certainly existed by 1641, from which time the ironmasters at Wortley were Thomas Cotton, and his son William Cotton (1627–1674); the latter being the father of Thomas Cotton. Cannonballs are said to have been made here during the English Civil War. After that the finery forges usually belonged to a network of ironmasters led by members of the Spencer family of Cannon Hall, Cawthorne, but not between 1676 and 1690, when they were rented by other ironmasters. The two forges were always leased together with a blast furnace, Nether Bank Furnace, until the latter&#x27;s closure probably about 1780, all of them being rented from the Wortley family.

In 1744, the forge was let to John Cockshutt (died 1774), who ran it with a partner. He also had a &#x27;tinmill&#x27;. He was followed by his son, another John, who was succeeded by his brother James about 1800. James had worked at Merthyr Tydfil as a partner of William Crawshay in the Cyfarthfa Ironworks and when he returned to Wortley in 1791 after the dissolution of their partnership, he introduced puddling to Wortley, the tinmill probably being altered to roll blooms into bars of iron. After James&#x27; death in 1820, the works passed to relatives and then through various hands, coming into the hands of Thomas Andrews in 1849. On his death in 1871 he was followed by his son another Thomas Andrews, who died in 1907.

One of the buildings at Top Forge includes a date stone for 1713. However, the current layout of the building dates from the 1850s when the forge was turned over to the production of shafts and axles mainly for use on railway wagons. Some of the earliest metallurgical experiments in the world were conducted at the site by the engineer and metallurgist Thomas Andrews. Railway axles of the highest quality were manufactured at the site in the nineteenth century and exported all over the world.

Production ceased around 1912, but parts of the site remained in use until 1929. One of the Top Forge hammers was run as a demonstration in 1933 or 1934. In 1955, the dream of C. R. Andrews (the son of the second Thomas) was fulfilled, the forge being reopened as an industrial museum by Sheffield Trades Historical Society (now South Yorkshire Industrial History Society). From the mid-1960s the Honorary Curator of the forge for over 40 years was Ken Hawley, who was the driving force behind a team of volunteer workers who preserved and restored the forge into its present condition – work that was recognised when he was appointed MBE in 1998.

Of particular interest is that the site only ever used waterwheels to power the machinery. All three waterwheels have been restored to working order. Its buildings are used to house a variety of industrial machinery, including a Marshall twin-cylinder steam engine.

==Heritage designations==
The whole of the site is a Scheduled Monument and the main forge is a Grade I listed building. Top Forge Cottage, and two other cottages south of the forge, are listed separately at Grade II.

<doc id="794654" wikidata="Q607743" url="?curid=794654" title="Aon Center (Los Angeles)">
<text>Aon Center is a 62-story, Modernist office skyscraper at 707 Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles, California. Site excavation started in late 1970, and the tower was completed in 1973. Designed by Charles Luckman, the rectangular bronze-clad building with white trim is remarkably slender for a skyscraper in a seismically active area. It is the third tallest building in Los Angeles, the fourth tallest in California, and the 58th tallest in the United States. The logo of the Aon Corporation, its anchor tenant, is displayed at the top in red.

==History==
Aon Center was originally named the United California Bank Building from its completion in 1973 until 1981, when it became First Interstate Tower. During the 1984 Summer Olympics, the 1984 Olympics logo was displayed on the north and south sides of the building&#x27;s crown, as First Interstate Bank was a major sponsor of the games. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River when built, until 1982 when it was surpassed by the Texas Commerce Tower (now known as JPMorgan Chase Tower) in Houston. Upon its completion in 1973, the building was the tallest in the world outside of New York and Chicago. It remained the tallest building in Los Angeles until 1989, when Library Tower (now U.S. Bank Tower) was completed. Between 1998 and 2001, there were no logos on the building.

Shorenstein, which purchased the Aon Center in 2014, sold the building to Carolwood, the firm controlled by Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld, in December 2023.

===Fire===

On May 4, 1988, a fire began on the 12th floor just after 10:00 PM; it burned for about four hours. The fire destroyed five floors, injured 40 people, and left an operating engineer dead because the elevator opened onto the burning 12th floor. The fire was so severe because the building was not equipped with a sprinkler system, which was not required for office towers at the time of its construction. A sprinkler system was 90 percent installed at the time of the fire; however, the system was inoperative, awaiting the installation of water flow alarms. The fire was eventually contained at 2:19 AM, and caused $400 million in damage. Repair work took four months. Because of the fire, building codes in Los Angeles were modified, requiring all high-rises to be equipped with fire sprinklers. This modified a 1974 ordinance that had only required new buildings to contain fire sprinkler systems.

<text>The Sopwith Triplane is a British single seat fighter aircraft designed and manufactured by the Sopwith Aviation Company during the First World War. It has the distinction of being the first military triplane to see operational service.

The Triplane was developed by the firm&#x27;s experimental department as a private venture, the project was headed by the designer Herbert Smith. Aside from its obvious difference in wing configuration, the aircraft shared many similarities with the company&#x27;s successful biplane fighter, the Sopwith Pup. The prototype Triplane performed its maiden flight on 28 May 1916 and was dispatched to the French theatre two months later, where it garnered high praise for its exceptional rate of climb and high manoeuvrability. During late 1916, quantity production of the type commenced in response to orders received from the Admiralty. During early 1917, production examples of the Triplane arrived with Royal Naval Air Service squadrons.

The Triplane rapidly proved to be capable of outstanding agility, and thus was quickly deemed to be a success amongst those squadrons that flew it. Praise for the type extended to opposing pilots; Imperial Germany extensively studied the Triplane via captured examples and produced numerous tri-winged aircraft shortly thereafter. Nevertheless, the Triplane was built in comparatively small numbers to that of the more conventional Sopwith Pup. It had been decided to withdraw the Triplane from active service as increasing numbers of the Sopwith Camel arrived in the latter half of 1917. Surviving Triplanes continued to serve as operational trainers and experimental aircraft until months following the end of the conflict.

==Development==
===Background===

During the First World War, the Sopwith Aviation Company became a prominent British manufacturer of military aircraft. It was amid this conflict that one of its employees, Herbert Smith, designed the Sopwith Pup, a single-seat biplane fighter aircraft which was described by aviation author J.M. Bruce as being &quot;one of the world&#x27;s greatest aeroplanes&quot;. While it was a capable fighter that possessed impressive handling qualities for its era, from an aerodynamic perspective, the Pup was an entirely conventional design. Certain figures, including those within Sopwith&#x27;s experimental department, sought to develop a successor which would instead pioneer new concepts for such an aircraft; out of such ambitions would emerge the Triplane.

Early on, Sopwith decided to pursue development of the Triplane concept as a private venture initiative. The design, which was passed by the company&#x27;s experimental department on 28 May 1916, was contemporary to the Sopwith L.R.T.Tr. project, which never progressed beyond the prototype stage; Bruce speculated that Smith may have been inspired by the L.R.T.Tr.&#x27;s atypical wing configuration to adopt the iconic triplane configuration for the new project. Beyond the obvious difference in terms of wing configuration, the Triplane&#x27;s design largely conformed with that of the Pup. It has been described as being a &quot;remarkably simple aircraft&quot;.

===Into flight===
The initial &quot;prototype of what was to be referred to simply as the Triplane&quot; first flew on 28 May 1916, with Sopwith test pilot Harry Hawker at the controls. Within three minutes of takeoff, Hawker startled onlookers by looping the aircraft, serial N500, three times in succession. Hawker noted that this was due to his high confidence in the aircraft despite its radical design. The Triplane was very agile, with effective, well-harmonised controls. When maneuvering, however, the Triplane presented an unusual appearance. One observer noted that the aircraft looked like &quot;a drunken flight of steps&quot; when rolling.

While initially lacking any armament, N500 was subsequently furnished with a single Vickers machine gun, which was mounted centrally in front of the cockpit. In July 1916, N500 was sent to Dunkirk for evaluation with &quot;A&quot; Naval Squadron, 1 Naval Wing. Being put into action within 15 minutes of its arrival to intercept enemy aircraft, N500 quickly proved to be highly successful. According to Bruce, it demonstrated exemplary maneuverability and a phenomenal rate of climb for the era.

The second prototype, N504, performed its maiden flight in August 1916. Its primary difference from the first prototype was the installation of a 130 hp Clerget 9B engine. N504 was eventually dispatched to France in December of that year. This aircraft served as a conversion trainer for several squadrons.

===Production===
Between July 1916 and January 1917, the Admiralty issued two contracts to Sopwith for a total of 95 Triplanes, two contracts to Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth Ltd. for a total of 46 aircraft, and one contract to Oakley &amp; Co. Ltd. for 25 aircraft. Seeking modern aircraft for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), the War Office also issued a contract to Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth for 106 Triplanes.

Quantity production of the type commenced in late 1916. The first Sopwith-built Triplanes were delivered to Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth, who delivered their first Triplane on 2 December 1916. A renewed urgency amongst the Allied Powers for high performance combat aircraft came following the emergence of the Albatros D.II, which entered service with Imperial Germany around this same time frame, which threatened Allied aerial supremacy. In February 1917, the War Office agreed to exchange its Triplane orders for the Admiralty&#x27;s SPAD S.VII contracts.

While both Sopwith and Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth successfully fulfilled their RNAS production orders, Oakley, which had no prior experience building aircraft, delivered only three Triplanes before its contract was cancelled during October 1917. For unknown reasons, the RFC Triplane contract issued to Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth was simply cancelled rather than being transferred to the RNAS. Total production of the type amounted to 147 aircraft.

==Design==
The Sopwith Triplane was a single seat fighter aircraft; it shared a considerable amount of its design features, such as its fuselage and empennage, with those of the earlier Pup. While the fuselage was structurally similar, Bruce notes that there were several areas of differences present. One example was the attachment points present for the center wings, which were carried upon the top and bottom longerons of the fuselage and in turn also attached to the center-section struts. One innovation that was present only on the Triplane was the use of single broad-chord interplane struts, which ran continuously between the lower and upper wings.

The most distinctive feature of the Triplane is its three narrow-chord wings; these provided the pilot with an improved field of view. These wings had the same span as that of the Pup, while being only 21 square feet less in terms of area. Ailerons were fitted to all three wings. The relatively narrow chord and short span wings have been attributed with providing a high level of manoeuvrability. The introduction of a smaller 8 ft span tailplane in February 1917 was attributed with improved elevator response. The original tail assembly was identical to the Pup&#x27;s, other than the inclusion of the variable incidence tailplane, which could be adjusted so that the aircraft could be flown hands-off.

The Triplane was initially powered by the 110 hp Clerget 9Z nine-cylinder rotary engine. However, the majority of production examples were instead fitted with the more powerful 130 hp Clerget 9B rotary. At least one Triplane was tested with a 110 hp Le Rhône rotary engine, but this did not provide a significant improvement in performance, the only seeming benefit being a slight increase in its rate of climb.

==Operational history==
===Introduction===

No. 1 Naval Squadron became fully operational with the Triplane by December 1916, but the squadron did not see any significant action until February 1917, when it relocated from Furnes to Chipilly. No. 8 Naval Squadron received its Triplanes in February 1917. Nos. 9 and 10 Naval Squadrons equipped with the type between April and May 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks p55/68&quot;&gt; Franks 2004, pp. 54, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

All but one British Triplane were dispatched to squadrons based in France; this sole aircraft was instead sent to the Aegean, although its service details and purpose there is largely unknown, only that its use was curtailed after a crash-landing in Salonika on 26 March 1917. Aside from the British, the only other major operator of the Triplane was a French naval squadron based at Dunkirk, which received 17 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks p62/63&quot;&gt; Franks 2004, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; A single example was shipped to the United States for exhibition purposes in December 1917. Furthermore, the Imperial Russian Air Service also operated a single Triplane during the latter half of 1917, its fate being unknown.

The Triplane&#x27;s combat debut was highly successful. The new fighter&#x27;s exceptional rate of climb and high service ceiling gave it a marked advantage over the Albatros D.III, though the Triplane was slower in a dive. During April 1917, Manfred von Richthofen, better known as &quot;The Red Baron&quot;, commented that the Triplane was the best Allied fighter at that time, a sentiment that was echoed by other German senior officers such as Ernst von Hoeppner. Multiple Triplanes were captured and subject to considerable evaluation and study. The Germans were so impressed by the aircraft&#x27;s performance that it spawned a brief triplane craze among German aircraft manufacturers. Their efforts resulted in no fewer than 34 different prototypes, including the Fokker V.4, prototype of the successful Fokker Dr.I.

Pilots nicknamed the aircraft the &quot;Tripehound&quot; or simply the &quot;Tripe&quot;. The Triplane was famously flown by &quot;B&quot; Flight 10 Naval Squadron, better known as the &quot;Black Flight&quot;. This all-Canadian flight was commanded by the ace Raymond Collishaw. Their aircraft, named &quot;Black Maria&quot;, &quot;Black Prince&quot;, &quot;Black George&quot;, &quot;Black Death&quot; and &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, were distinguishable by their black-painted fins and cowlings. The Black Flight claimed 87 German aircraft in three months while equipped with the Triplane. Collishaw scored 34 of his eventual 60 victories in the aircraft, making him the top Triplane ace.

===Issues===
The Triplane&#x27;s combat career was comparatively brief, in part because it proved difficult to repair. The fuel and oil tanks were inaccessible without dismantling the wings and fuselage; even relatively minor repairs had to be made at rear echelon repair depots. Spare parts became difficult to obtain during the summer of 1917, resulting in the reduction of No. 1 Naval Squadron&#x27;s complement from 18 to 15 aircraft. According to Bruce, it is plausible that squadrons were slow to refit their Triplanes with the improved tailplane due to a lack of available kits for doing so.

The Triplane also gained a reputation for structural weakness because the wings of some aircraft collapsed in steep dives. This defect was attributed to the use of light gauge bracing wires in the 46 aircraft built by subcontractor Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth. Several pilots of No. 10 Naval Squadron used cables or additional wires to strengthen their Triplanes. Bruce alleges that there was no substance to the concerns of structural weakness. In 1918, the RAF issued a technical order for the installation of a spanwise compression strut between the inboard cabane struts of surviving Triplanes. One aircraft, serial N5912, was fitted with additional mid-bay flying wires on the upper wing while used as a trainer.

Another drawback of the Triplane was its light armament. Contemporary Albatros fighters were armed with two guns but most Triplanes carried one synchronised Vickers machine gun. Efforts to fit twin guns to the Triplane met with mixed results. Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth built six experimental Triplanes with twin guns. Some of these aircraft saw combat service with Nos. 1 and 10 Naval Squadrons in July 1917 but performance was reduced and the single gun remained standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks p13/69&quot;&gt; Franks 2004, pp. 13, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Triplanes built by Oakley would have featured twin guns, an engineering change which severely delayed production.

===Withdrawal from service===
In June 1917, No. 4 Naval Squadron received the first Sopwith Camels and the advantages of the sturdier, better-armed fighter quickly became evident. Nos. 8 and 9 Naval Squadrons re-equipped with Camels between early July and early August 1917. No. 10 Naval Squadron converted in late August, turning over its remaining Triplanes to No. 1 Naval Squadron. No. 1 operated Triplanes until December, allegedly suffering heavy casualties as a consequence of the slow replacement of their Triplanes.

By the end of 1917, surviving Triplanes were used as advanced trainers with No. 12 Naval Squadron. For a time, the type remained in use for experimental and training purposes; examples were recorded as performing flights as late as October 1918. Six British aces scored all of their victories on Sopwith Triplanes. These were John Albert Page (7), Thomas Culling (6), Cyril Askew Eyre (6), F. H. Maynard (6), Gerald Ewart Nash (6) and Anthony Arnold (5).

<text>mod_python is an Apache HTTP Server module that integrates the Python programming language with the server. It is intended to provide a Python language binding for the Apache HTTP Server.

When mod_python released it was one of the more efficient options for Python scripts compared to CGI as CGI requests require starting a new Python process to respond to each individual web request.

==History==

The initial implementation of mod_python was a port to Apache HTTP server of a project called NSAPy. NSAPy was written by Aaron Watters for the Netscape Enterprise Server and was used as an example in a chapter of the book &quot;Internet Programming with Python&quot; written by Aaron Watters, Guido van Rossum, and James Ahlstrom. The first version of mod_python was released by Gregory Trubetskoy in 2000. In September 2002, mod_python was donated to the Apache Software Foundation and became part of the Apache HTTP Server project.

Since the development of Python&#x27;s Web Server Gateway Interface from PEP 3333 in December 2003, interest in mod_python has largely moved to WSGI-compliant alternatives such as mod_wsgi.

Development on the project eventually ceased due to inactivity of the primary contributors and in The Apache Software Foundation June 16, 2010 Board meeting, the Board unanimously passed a resolution terminating Apache Quetzalcoatl Project (umbrella project for mod_python).

In September 2013, development of mod_python briefly resumed independent of the Apache Software Foundation however it has been largely inactive since and no new releases were created.

<doc id="794679" wikidata="Q1426863" url="?curid=794679" title="Suffix tree">
<text>In computer science, a suffix tree (also called PAT tree or, in an earlier form, position tree) is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values. Suffix trees allow particularly fast implementations of many important string operations.

The construction of such a tree for the string formula_1 takes time and space linear in the length of formula_1. Once constructed, several operations can be performed quickly, such as locating a substring in formula_1, locating a substring if a certain number of mistakes are allowed, and locating matches for a regular expression pattern. Suffix trees also provided one of the first linear-time solutions for the longest common substring problem. These speedups come at a cost: storing a string&#x27;s suffix tree typically requires significantly more space than storing the string itself.

==History==
The concept was first introduced by .
Rather than the suffix formula_4, Weiner stored in his trie the &quot;prefix identifier&quot; for each position, that is, the shortest string starting at formula_5 and occurring only once in formula_1. His &quot;Algorithm D&quot; takes an uncompressed trie for formula_7 and extends it into a trie for formula_8. This way, starting from the trivial trie for formula_9, a trie for formula_10 can be built by formula_11 successive calls to Algorithm D; however, the overall run time is formula_12. Weiner&#x27;s &quot;Algorithm B&quot; maintains several auxiliary data structures, to achieve an overall run time linear in the size of the constructed trie. The latter can still be formula_12 nodes, e.g. for formula_14 Weiner&#x27;s &quot;Algorithm C&quot; finally uses compressed tries to achieve linear overall storage size and run time.
Donald Knuth subsequently characterized the latter as &quot;Algorithm of the Year 1973&quot; according to his student Vaughan Pratt.
The text book reproduced Weiner&#x27;s results in a simplified and more elegant form, introducing the term &quot;position tree&quot;.

 was the first to build a (compressed) trie of all suffixes of formula_1. Although the suffix starting at formula_5 is usually longer than the prefix identifier, their path representations in a compressed trie do not differ in size. On the other hand, McCreight could dispense with most of Weiner&#x27;s auxiliary data structures; only suffix links remained.

 further simplified the construction. He provided the first online-construction of suffix trees, now known as Ukkonen&#x27;s algorithm, with running time that matched the then fastest algorithms.
These algorithms are all linear-time for a constant-size alphabet, and have worst-case running time of formula_17 in general.

 gave the first suffix tree construction algorithm that is optimal for all alphabets. In particular, this is the first linear-time algorithm 
for strings drawn from an alphabet of integers in a polynomial range. Farach&#x27;s algorithm has become the basis for new algorithms for constructing both suffix trees and suffix arrays, for example, in external memory, compressed, succinct, etc.

==Definition==
The suffix tree for the string formula_1 of length formula_19 is defined as a tree such that:
# The tree has exactly n leaves numbered from formula_20 to formula_19.
# Except for the root, every internal node has at least two children.
# Each edge is labelled with a non-empty substring of formula_1.
# No two edges starting out of a node can have string-labels beginning with the same character.
# The string obtained by concatenating all the string-labels found on the path from the root to leaf formula_5 spells out suffix formula_4, for formula_5 from formula_20 to formula_19.

If a suffix of formula_1 is also the prefix of another suffix, such a tree does not exist for the string. For example, in the string &quot;abcbc&quot;, the suffix &quot;bc&quot; is also a prefix of the suffix &quot;bcbc&quot;. In such a case, the path spelling out &quot;bc&quot; will not end in a leaf, violating the fifth rule. To fix this problem, formula_1 is padded with a terminal symbol not seen in the string (usually denoted codice_1). This ensures that no suffix is a prefix of another, and that there will be formula_19 leaf nodes, one for each of the formula_19 suffixes of formula_1. Since all internal non-root nodes are branching, there can be at most formula_33 such nodes, and formula_34 nodes in total (formula_19 leaves, formula_33 internal non-root nodes, 1 root).

Suffix links are a key feature for older linear-time construction algorithms, although most newer algorithms, which are based on Farach&#x27;s algorithm, dispense with suffix links. In a complete suffix tree, all internal non-root nodes have a suffix link to another internal node. If the path from the root to a node spells the string formula_37, where formula_38 is a single character and formula_39 is a string (possibly empty), it has a suffix link to the internal node representing formula_39. See for example the suffix link from the node for codice_2 to the node for codice_3 in the figure above. Suffix links are also used in some algorithms running on the tree.

A generalized suffix tree is a suffix tree made for a set of strings instead of a single string. It represents all suffixes from this set of strings. Each string must be terminated by a different termination symbol.

==Functionality==

A suffix tree for a string formula_1 of length formula_19 can be built in formula_43 time, if the letters come from an alphabet of integers in a polynomial range (in particular, this is true for constant-sized alphabets).
For larger alphabets, the running time is dominated by first sorting the letters to bring them into a range of size formula_44; in general, this takes formula_17 time.
The costs below are given under the assumption that the alphabet is constant.

Assume that a suffix tree has been built for the string formula_1 of length formula_19, or that a generalised suffix tree has been built for the set of strings formula_48 of total length formula_49.
You can:

* Search for strings:
** Check if a string formula_50 of length formula_51 is a substring in formula_52 time.
** Find the first occurrence of the patterns formula_53 of total length formula_51 as substrings in formula_52 time.
** Find all formula_56 occurrences of the patterns formula_53 of total length formula_51 as substrings in formula_59 time.

** Search for a regular expression &quot;P&quot; in time expected sublinear in formula_19.
** Find for each suffix of a pattern formula_50, the length of the longest match between a prefix of formula_62 and a substring in formula_63 in formula_64 time. This is termed the matching statistics for formula_50.
* Find properties of the strings:
** Find the longest common substrings of the string formula_66 and formula_67 in formula_68 time.
** Find all maximal pairs, maximal repeats or supermaximal repeats in formula_69 time.
** Find the Lempel–Ziv decomposition in formula_43 time.
** Find the longest repeated substrings in formula_43 time.
** Find the most frequently occurring substrings of a minimum length in formula_43 time.
** Find the shortest strings from formula_73 that do not occur in formula_63, in formula_75 time, if there are formula_56 such strings.
** Find the shortest substrings occurring only once in formula_43 time.
** Find, for each formula_5, the shortest substrings of formula_66 not occurring elsewhere in formula_63 in formula_43 time.

The suffix tree can be prepared for constant time lowest common ancestor retrieval between nodes in formula_43 time. One can then also:
* Find the longest common prefix between the suffixes formula_83 and formula_84 in formula_85.
* Search for a pattern &quot;P&quot; of length &quot;m&quot; with at most &quot;k&quot; mismatches in formula_86 time, where &quot;z&quot; is the number of hits.
* Find all formula_56 maximal palindromes in formula_43, or formula_89 time if gaps of length formula_90 are allowed, or formula_91 if formula_92 mismatches are allowed.
* Find all formula_56 tandem repeats in formula_94, and &quot;k&quot;-mismatch tandem repeats in formula_95.
* Find the longest common substrings to at least formula_92 strings in formula_63 for formula_98 in formula_43 time.
* Find the longest palindromic substring of a given string (using the generalized suffix tree of the string and its reverse) in linear time.

== Applications ==
Suffix trees can be used to solve a large number of string problems that occur in text-editing, free-text search, computational biology and other application areas. Primary applications include:
* String search, in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) complexity, where &quot;m&quot; is the length of the sub-string (but with initial &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) time required to build the suffix tree for the string)
* Finding the longest repeated substring
* Finding the longest common substring
* Finding the longest palindrome in a string

Suffix trees are often used in bioinformatics applications, searching for patterns in DNA or protein sequences (which can be viewed as long strings of characters). The ability to search efficiently with mismatches might be considered their greatest strength. Suffix trees are also used in data compression; they can be used to find repeated data, and can be used for the sorting stage of the Burrows–Wheeler transform. Variants of the LZW compression schemes use suffix trees (LZSS). A suffix tree is also used in suffix tree clustering, a data clustering algorithm used in some search engines.

==Implementation==
If each node and edge can be represented in formula_85 space, the entire tree can be represented in formula_43 space. The total length of all the strings on all of the edges in the tree is formula_12, but each edge can be stored as the position and length of a substring of , giving a total space usage of formula_43 computer words. The worst-case space usage of a suffix tree is seen with a fibonacci word, giving the full formula_104 nodes.

An important choice when making a suffix tree implementation is the parent-child relationships between nodes. The most common is using linked lists called sibling lists. Each node has a pointer to its first child, and to the next node in the child list it is a part of. Other implementations with efficient running time properties use hash maps, sorted or unsorted arrays (with array doubling), or balanced search trees. We are interested in:
* The cost of finding the child on a given character.
* The cost of inserting a child.
* The cost of enlisting all children of a node (divided by the number of children in the table below).

Let be the size of the alphabet. Then you have the following costs:
The insertion cost is amortised, and that the costs for hashing are given for perfect hashing.

The large amount of information in each edge and node makes the suffix tree very expensive, consuming about 10 to 20 times the memory size of the source text in good implementations. The suffix array reduces this requirement to a factor of 8 (for array including LCP values built within 32-bit address space and 8-bit characters.) This factor depends on the properties and may reach 2 with usage of 4-byte wide characters (needed to contain any symbol in some UNIX-like systems, see wchar_t) on 32-bit systems. Researchers have continued to find smaller indexing structures.

== Parallel construction ==

Various parallel algorithms to speed up suffix tree construction have been proposed.
Recently, a practical parallel algorithm for suffix tree construction with formula_44 work (sequential time) and formula_106 span has been developed. The algorithm achieves good parallel scalability on shared-memory multicore machines and can index the human genome – approximately 3GB – in under 3 minutes using a 40-core machine.

==External construction==

Though linear, the memory usage of a suffix tree is significantly higher
than the actual size of the sequence collection. For a large text,
construction may require external memory approaches.

There are theoretical results for constructing suffix trees in external
memory.
The algorithm by 
is theoretically optimal, with an I/O complexity equal to that of sorting.
However the overall intricacy of this algorithm has prevented, so far, its
practical implementation.

On the other hand, there have been practical works for constructing
disk-based suffix trees
which scale to (few) GB/hours.
The state of the art methods are TDD,
TRELLIS,
DiGeST,
and
B2ST.

TDD and TRELLIS scale up to the entire human genome resulting in a disk-based suffix tree of a size in the tens of gigabytes. However, these methods cannot handle efficiently collections of sequences exceeding 3 GB. DiGeST performs significantly better and is able to handle collections of sequences in the order of 6 GB in about 6 hours.

All these methods can efficiently build suffix trees for the case when the
tree does not fit in main memory,
but the input does.
The most recent method, B2ST, scales to handle
inputs that do not fit in main memory. ERA is a recent parallel suffix tree construction method that is significantly faster. ERA can index the entire human genome in 19 minutes on an 8-core desktop computer with 16 GB RAM. On a simple Linux cluster with 16 nodes (4 GB RAM per node), ERA can index the entire human genome in less than 9 minutes.

<text>Acarology (from Ancient Greek /, , a type of mite; and , ) is the study of mites and ticks, the animals in the order Acarina. It is a subfield of arachnology, a subdiscipline of the field of zoology. A zoologist specializing in acarology is called an acarologist. Acarologists may also be parasitologists because many members of Acarina are parasitic. Many acarologists are studying around the world both professionally and as amateurs. The discipline is a developing science and research has been provided for it in more recent history.

<text>Idina Kim Menzel ( ; ; born May 30, 1971) is an American actress and singer. Particularly known for her work in musicals on Broadway, she has been nicknamed the &quot;Queen of Broadway&quot; for her commanding stage presence, powerful mezzo-soprano, and reputation as one of the most influential stage actors of her generation. Having achieved mainstream success across stage, screen, and music, her accolades include a Tony Award and a Daytime Emmy Award.

Menzel rose to prominence as a stage actress in 1996, making her Broadway debut as performance artist Maureen Johnson in the rock musical &quot;Rent,&quot; which earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. In 2003, she originated the role of Elphaba in the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; on Broadway, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. After leaving the show in 2005, she reprised the role in the musical&#x27;s original West End production in 2006, becoming the highest-paid actress in West End theatre history. In 2014, Menzel returned to Broadway in the musical &quot;If/Then&quot;, for which she received a third Tony Award nomination.

Menzel began transitioning into film and television in the early 2000s. After reprising her &quot;Rent&quot; role in the musical&#x27;s 2005 film adaptation, she had a supporting role in Disney&#x27;s musical fantasy film &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007). She played recurring character Shelby Corcoran on the musical television series &quot;Glee&quot; from 2010 to 2013. Since 2013, Menzel has voiced Elsa in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Frozen&quot; franchise; &quot;Let It Go&quot;, a song she recorded for the first film, peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Menzel has since played supporting roles in the films &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; (2019), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2021), and &quot;You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah&quot; (2023).

As a recording artist and songwriter, Menzel has released seven studio albums, including &quot;I Stand&quot; (2008) and &quot;Holiday Wishes&quot; (2014)&quot;;&quot; the latter peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her highest-charting studio album to-date.

== Early life and education ==

Idina Kim Menzel was born on May 30, 1971, in Manhattan. She grew up in New Jersey until about age three; her family moved to Syosset, New York, on Long Island. Her parents are Stuart Mentzel, a pajama salesman, and Helene Goldberg, a therapist. She has a younger sister named Cara. Menzel is Jewish and her grandparents emigrated from Russia. She attended J. Irving Baylis Elementary School in Plainview, New York, as well as H. B. Thompson Middle School in Syosset, and Syosset High School.

When Menzel was 15 years old, her parents divorced and she began working as a wedding and bar/bat mitzvah singer, a job that she held while a student at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts; she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in drama there in 1992. Idina changed the spelling of her surname to &quot;Menzel&quot; to better reflect the pronunciation that the Mentzel family had adopted in the United States. She was friends with actor Adam Pascal before they worked together in &quot;Rent&quot;.

In 2017, Irish songwriter Jimmy Walsh who was based in New York City said that in 1992, Menzel had recorded a demo for him of the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, which went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 for Irish singer Niamh Kavanagh. Menzel was paid $75 for the recording.

== Career ==
=== Theater career ===
==== &quot;Rent&quot; to &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (1996–2000) ====
In 1995, Menzel auditioned for &quot;Rent&quot;, which became her first professional theatre job and her Broadway debut. &quot;Rent&quot; opened Off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop on January 26, 1996, but it moved to Broadway&#x27;s Nederlander Theatre due to its popularity. For her performance as Maureen Johnson in the original cast of the musical, Menzel received a Tony nomination as Best Featured Actress in a Musical losing to Ann Duquesnay for &quot;Bring in &#x27;da Noise, Bring in &#x27;da Funk&quot;. Her final performance in the musical was on July 1, 1997. Despite her breakout performance in &quot;Rent&quot;, Menzel did not experience the immediate success she was expecting, claiming she subsequently faded into &quot;obscurity&quot; for the following eight years.

Following the success of &quot;Rent&quot;, Menzel released her first solo album entitled &quot;Still I Can&#x27;t Be Still&quot; on Hollywood Records. Menzel also originated the role of Dorothy in &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; at Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut, starred as Sheila in the New York City Center Encores! production of &quot;Hair&quot; and appeared on Broadway as Amneris in &quot;Aida&quot;. Menzel earned a Drama Desk Award nomination for her performance as Kate in the Manhattan Theatre Club&#x27;s 2000 Off-Broadway production of Andrew Lippa&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Party&quot;. Her other Off-Broadway credits include the pre-Broadway run of &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

==== &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;If/Then&quot;, &quot;Skintight, to WILD&quot; (2003–2021) ====

In 2003, Menzel starred alongside Kristin Chenoweth on Broadway in &quot;Wicked&quot;, a musical by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman based upon Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;&quot;. Shortly after a San Francisco try-out, &quot;Wicked&quot; began previews on October 8, 2003, with an official opening night on October 30. Menzel&#x27;s performance as Elphaba, the misunderstood Wicked Witch of the West, garnered critical acclaim, for which she won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Menzel&#x27;s character also earned her a devoted fanbase, particularly among young girls who empathized with her misunderstood character, as well as a gay following. She can be heard on the show&#x27;s Original Broadway Cast (OBC) recording. During her penultimate performance on January 8, 2005, she fell through a trap door during the melting scene and cracked a lower rib. This injury prevented her from performing in her scheduled final show on January 9; her standby, Shoshana Bean, played Elphaba at that performance. Menzel did, however, make a special appearance, in a red tracksuit, at that performance, performed her last song, and received a five-minute standing ovation. Menzel was replaced by Elphaba standby Shoshana Bean. In 2010, Broadway.com readers voted Menzel their favourite Elphaba performer out of the then-eleven actresses who had played the character on Broadway.

Following &quot;Wicked&quot;, Menzel appeared Off-Broadway in the Public Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;See What I Wanna See&quot;, a Michael John LaChiusa-penned musical whose run ended in December 2005, for which she received Drama Desk Award and Drama League Award nominations. She reprised her Tony Award-winning role as Elphaba in the West End production of &quot;Wicked&quot; when it opened at London&#x27;s Apollo Victoria Theatre on September 27, 2006. She starred alongside Helen Dallimore as Glinda and Adam Garcia as Fiyero. During her run, she was the highest-paid female performer in the West End at $30,000 per week. Menzel finished her West End run on December 30, 2006. She was succeeded by Elphaba standby Kerry Ellis.

Menzel played the role of Florence in the 21st-anniversary concert of the musical &quot;Chess&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, from May 12 to 13, 2008, alongside Kerry Ellis, Adam Pascal, and Josh Groban. In 2008, she headlined the Powerhouse Theatre&#x27;s reading of Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik&#x27;s musical &quot;Nero&quot; from July 11 to 13, performing the role of Nero&#x27;s mistress, Poppea. She was joined by &quot;Glee&quot; costar Lea Michele as Claudia Octavia, Jeffrey Carleson as Nero, and Michael Arden as Octavia&#x27;s brother, Brittanicus.

By February 28, 2013, Menzel was cast to star as Elizabeth in the new Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey Broadway musical &quot;If/Then&quot;. Directed by Michael Greif (with whom Menzel previously worked on the original production of &quot;Rent&quot;), it had its world premiere at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., starting with previews on November 5, 2013, until November 24, 2013. Following the out-of-town tryout, the show moved to the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway and began previews on March 4, 2014. It officially opened on March 30, 2014. For her performance, Menzel received her second Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and performed Always Starting Over, but lost to Jessie Mueller for &quot;&quot;. &quot;If/Then&quot; closed on Broadway on March 22, 2015, after 29 previews and 401 regular performances.

Menzel reprised the role of Elizabeth (along with original Broadway cast members Lachanze, James Snyder, and Anthony Rapp) on the first seven stops of the show&#x27;s national tour from October 2015 to January 2016. She departed the show (along with LaChanze and Snyder) on the last day of the Costa Mesa, California engagement, on January 24, 2016. Her replacement was Jackie Burns (who previously served as Menzel&#x27;s standby in the Broadway production) starting January 27, 2016, in Dallas, Texas.

Later, in 2018, Menzel was cast as Jodi in Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s World Premiere production of Joshua Harmon&#x27;s new play &quot;Skintight&quot;. The show premiered Off Broadway at the Laura Pels Theatre at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre. It began previews on May 31, 2018, opened on June 21, 2018, and ran for strictly limited engagement till August 26, 2018. The play earned Menzel rave reviews and marking it her first major New York Theater non-musical role. A year later, she reprised her performance in &quot;Skintight&quot; marking its debut on the West Coast. The production played the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, California running from September 3 – October 6, 2019.

While appearing in &quot;Skintight&quot;, Menzel read for the role of Mary Jane in a workshop for the Broadway rock musical &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;.

In late 2019, Menzel revealed on Twitter that she was working on &quot;a mystery project&quot; with Justin Tranter, Caroline Pennell and Eve Ensler (later known as V). In mid-2021, it was announced that this project is &quot;Wild: A Musical Becoming&quot;, set to perform at American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, MA from December 3, 2021, to January 21, 2022 (she was only scheduled to perform through December 23). It was later announced that she would star as Bea, with contributions to the lyrics. On December 17, due to COVID, it was announced that the show on that day was cancelled; it was later announced that the performance on the following two days and eventually all the following productions were cancelled, making December 16 her last performance.

==== Redwood (2025–) ====
Menzel plays the main role of Jesse in &quot;Redwood&quot;, a musical that premiered at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California on February 25, 2024. The musical will preview on Broadway, at the Nederlander Theatre, on January 24, 2025. Menzel and Tina Landau created the musical; with composer/lyricist Kate Diaz, writing the music for Menzel.

=== Music career ===
Menzel initially struggled to crossover into a solo music career beyond stage musicals, claiming the industry did not take her seriously as a pop or rock singer due to her Broadway origins. Menzel performed at the 1998 Lilith Fair summer concert festival and continues to write and perform original music. She has toured extensively and frequently performs in various venues throughout New York City. She produced and released her debut album, &quot;Still I Can&#x27;t Be Still&quot;, for Hollywood Records in 1998. One single from the album, &quot;Minuet&quot;, made the Radio &amp; Records CHR/Pop Tracks chart at number 48 in October 1998. Following the album release, she embarked on a promotional tour, but after selling fewer than 10,000 copies in the US and missing the Billboard 200, Menzel&#x27;s label put the album out of print, and she was dropped from the label. However, the album was re-released once she began to rise to greater fame with her Tony-winning performance in &quot;Wicked&quot;.

Her second album, &quot;Here&quot;, was released independently by Zel Records in 2004. Menzel contributed to the soundtrack of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; in 2005. She also appears on Ray Charles&#x27;s album &quot;Genius and Friends,&quot; which was also released in 2005, on the track &quot;I Will Be There&quot;. In 2007, she appeared on the &quot;Beowulf&quot; soundtrack singing the end credits song, &quot;A Hero Comes Home&quot;. Also, in 2007, Menzel&#x27;s powerful singing voice led her to be asked to accompany the baritone British &quot;X Factor&quot; runner-up, Rhydian Roberts, on his debut album, duetting on the song &quot;What If&quot;.

Her third solo album, &quot;I Stand&quot;, was released on January 29, 2008. It includes many new songs, including the lead single, &quot;Brave&quot;, the title track &quot;I Stand&quot;, and a song released on EP, &quot;Gorgeous&quot;. The album debuted at number 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the first solo album by Menzel to make the charts. There are five versions of this album: the original version, the special limited edition, the iTunes version, the Barnes &amp; Noble edition, and the Borders edition. Menzel wrote 9 of the 10 songs on her album, with the song &quot;Forever&quot; writing only by herself.

On April 1, 2008, Menzel kicked off her 2008–2009 &quot;I Stand&quot; tour in support of her new album performing four sold-out legs. The concert at Rose Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City was filmed for the PBS television series &quot;Soundstage&quot;. Menzel was joined by special guests, superstar Josh Groban and saxophonist Ravi Coltrane.

On November 11, 2008, Menzel released &quot;Hope,&quot; written by Paul Hampton, benefiting Stand Up to Cancer. On November 27, 2008, she performed &quot;I Stand&quot; on the M&amp;M&#x27;s Chocolate float as part of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

On July 19, 2010, Menzel performed &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and &quot;What I Did For Love&quot; in front of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at &quot;A Broadway Celebration: In Performance at the White House.&quot; The concert aired on PBS on October 20, 2010.

In April 2010, Menzel returned to the concert stage embarking on her &quot;Barefoot at the Symphony Tour&quot; in which she was accompanied by major symphony orchestras. Her performances included collaborations with the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Pops Orchestra, and the North Carolina Symphony, and featured symphonic arrangements by New York composer and producer Rob Mounsey. In October 2011, Menzel returned to London to perform a one-night-only concert in the United Kingdom at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with Marvin Hamlisch conducting. Menzel&#x27;s concert stop in Toronto was filmed at The Royal Conservatory of Music on November 17 and 18, 2011, for her second PBS special. She was accompanied by the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony with Marvin Hamlisch conducting and special guest Taye Diggs, Menzel&#x27;s then-husband. &quot;Idina Menzel Live: Barefoot at the Symphony&quot; was released as a live CD and DVD and aired on PBS in March 2012, with Musical Director Rob Mounsey producing.

Menzel announced she would continue live performances in 2012. The first date she announced was July 8, 2012, at Ravinia Festival near Chicago, Illinois. She made her Carnegie Hall solo debut (originally on October 29, 2012). However, due to Hurricane Sandy&#x27;s impact on New York City, it was postponed until January 13, 2013.

Menzel toured Australia in June 2013 with shows in South Australia, Melbourne, Brisbane, and two at the Sydney Opera House.

On June 17, 2014, during a concert at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall, Menzel confirmed that she was working on a Christmas album that would contain original material to be released later that same year. In that concert, she performed one of the original tunes from the album, &quot;December Prayer&quot;. The album, &quot;Holiday Wishes&quot;, was released on October 14, 2014. The album has so far peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her highest-charting album as a solo lead artist. &quot;Holiday Wishes&quot; also marked the first that a woman had three different albums (along with the cast recording to &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;If/Then&quot;) peak within the top 20 within ten months of the release date. &quot;Holiday Wishes&quot; also become the second-ever Christmas album to chart before Halloween during the SoundScan Era after Garth Brooks&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Beyond the Season&quot;. On November 26, 2014, Menzel announced through her Facebook page that she would be touring during the summer of 2015, making it her first global tour and first time playing shows in Europe and Asia.

Menzel was honored with the Breakthrough Artist award at the 2014 &quot;Billboard&quot; Women in Music awards ceremony.

Menzel sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; a cappella at Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015. Menzel&#x27;s rendition earned mixed reviews from critics, who praised the quality of her voice but questioned some of her stylistic choices, namely tempo and volume. In a complementary review, Markos Papadatos of &quot;The Digital Journal&quot; felt Menzel redeemed her reputation as a strong vocalist after pundits had criticized her live performance of &quot;Let it Go&quot; at Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve the previous year.

On August 5, 2016, Menzel announced she would release her eponymous fifth album, on September 23. Of the release, Menzel stated: &quot;I poured my heart out and used my music as a place to kind of figure some things out. It&#x27;s a really personal album.&quot; Marking it as her first original Pop studio album in 8 years since &quot;I Stand&quot;, the album debuted at # 29 on the US Billboard 200. With the success of the album, Menzel embarked on a World Tour in 2017 that traveled to Asia, Europe, and North America. Menzel&#x27;s concert stop in Las Vegas was recorded for her second live album entitled &quot;idina Live&quot; and released on October 12, 2018.

On March 12, 2018, it was announced that Menzel would join Josh Groban for his Bridges Tour. For this tour, she served as Groban&#x27;s Opening act before joining him later during his set for two duets of &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Falling Slowly&quot;. Menzel only performed with Groban on the first leg of North America in various cities, including Atlanta, Nashville, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh, and a sold-out performance at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The New York City show (entitled &quot;Bridges Live From Madison Square Garden&quot;) was also filmed and released in Movie Theaters &amp; later a Live CD &amp; DVD release with an airing on PBS.

On May 11, 2019, it was revealed that she had signed to Scooter Braun and SB Projects for music management. Four years later, on August 22, 2023, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed that Menzel was no longer being represented by Braun, having left his management that January.

On October 18, 2019, Menzel released her second holiday album entitled &quot;&quot; from School Boy and Decca Records on October 18, 2019. It debuted at #2 on Billboard&#x27;s US Top Holiday Albums. In support of it, Menzel embarked on a three-city concert tour in the east coast including a sold-out return to New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

On October 11, 2022, Menzel announced on her Instagram page that she would be releasing a concert special on Disney+ on December 9 titled &quot;Idina Menzel: Which Way to the Stage?&quot;. The special will consist of concert footage from Madison Square Garden in New York. The title is a nod to Menzel&#x27;s first line as Maureen in &quot;Rent&quot;.

=== Film and television career ===

==== Early screen appearances (2001–2010) ====
Menzel&#x27;s feature film debut was the 2001 romantic comedy &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot; in which she had a minor role as a bridesmaid, followed by an uncredited appearance as Linda in the dark comedy &quot;Just a Kiss&quot; (2002). While starring in &quot;Wicked&quot;, she appeared in the coming-of-age dramedy &quot;The Tollbooth&quot; (2004), playing main character Sarabeth&#x27;s (Marla Sokoloff) pregnant sister, Raquel Cohen-Flaxman.

Menzel starred in her first major film venture in 2005 when she reprised the role of Maureen Johnson in the film adaptation of &quot;Rent&quot;, directed by Chris Columbus. Menzel was one of six original Broadway cast members who returned for the film, including then-husband Taye Diggs. Although rumors of a &quot;Rent&quot; movie had persisted for several years before it was green-lit, Menzel did not consider herself eligible because she assumed A-list Hollywood actors would be preferred if a film version ever materialized, until Columbus approached her directly. However, Menzel was the musical&#x27;s only main female cast member not replaced by a younger actress, despite all actors being several years older than their characters by the time the film was released. Menzel felt the film&#x27;s chemistry benefited from retaining most of the show&#x27;s original cast. &quot;Rent&quot; was released to mixed reviews and underperformed at the box office, but critics complimented Menzel&#x27;s performance. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; film critic Owen Gleiberman called Menzel&#x27;s duet with actress Tracie Thoms (as girlfriend Joanne Jefferson) a highlight. IGN&#x27;s Eric Goldman described Menzel as &quot;incredibly charismatic and fun&quot;, although her performance failed to interest him in performance art. The following year, Menzel and her castmates were nominated for Best Acting Ensemble at the 11th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards.

In 2006, she played Vera Rivkin in Robert Towne&#x27;s &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, a romantic drama starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek. Menzel&#x27;s character, a mysterious Jewish woman, harbors unrequited feelings for struggling writer Arturo, played by Farrell. Despite her limited screen time, she considers Vera one of her favorite film roles, citing her character&#x27;s lack of singing and difficulty overcoming difficult situations as essential to demonstrating her versatility. &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; was poorly received by film critics. However, Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; cautioned audiences to remember Menzel&#x27;s name, writing, &quot;the film comes to life when she barges in and finds it hard to keep it together after she&#x27;s gone&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s Ruthe Stein said Menzel enlivens the material by sharing more chemistry with Farrell during their brief scenes together than Hayek does throughout the entire film.

In 2007, Menzel appeared in the musical fantasy film &quot;Enchanted&quot; as Nancy Tremaine, the fiancée of Patrick Dempsey&#x27;s character Robert and Giselle&#x27;s (Amy Adams) romantic rival. Despite being a musical, Menzel famously does not sing in the film; several songs composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz had written for her character were ultimately omitted from the final version. Menzel was offered the role without auditioning, and was flattered that Disney would cast her solely based on her acting. Menzel explained that singing would have been out of character for Nancy, who is a New York native unlike the film&#x27;s more fantastical characters. She opted to portray Nancy with vulnerability as opposed to &quot;a typical mean girlfriend that everyone&#x27;s going to hate&quot;. &quot;Enchanted&quot; was a critical and commercial success, but &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s Kirk Honeycutt and Jim Lane of the &quot;Sacramento News &amp; Review&quot; felt the film underused Menzel&#x27;s talents. Some critics and fans also expressed disappointment over Menzel&#x27;s lack of musical numbers.

From 2010 to 2013, Menzel had a recurring role on the musical comedy television series &quot;Glee&quot; as Shelby Corcoran: the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, and the biological mother of series lead Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Fans of the show had long observed a strong physical resemblance between Menzel and Michele, and lobbied for the former to be cast as Michele&#x27;s onscreen mother. Menzel appeared in 12 episodes across the series, and covered songs such as &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; from &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Poker Face&quot; by Lady Gaga.

==== &quot;Frozen&quot; and worldwide recognition (2013–2016) ====
In 2013, Menzel voiced Elsa – a reclusive young queen struggling with her magical ability to control ice and snow – in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Frozen&quot;. After failing to secure the lead role in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010), the studio re-discovered Menzel&#x27;s audition reel while casting &quot;Frozen&quot;. Loosely based on the titular villain in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, Menzel&#x27;s character was re-written into a misunderstood anti-heroine for Disney&#x27;s adaptation, inspired by songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez&#x27;s creation of her anthem &quot;Let It Go&quot;, which they wrote specifically for Menzel due to its demanding vocal range. Released to critical acclaim, &quot;Frozen&quot; became the highest-grossing animated film upon release, earning over $1.2 billion worldwide. Meanwhile, &quot;Let It Go&quot; became a global phenomenon, with countless fans and artists releasing their own Internet covers and parodies. A crossover radio hit, the song peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making Menzel the first Tony Award–winning actor to achieve a top-10 placement on the chart. Despite its non-commercial sound, &quot;Let it Go&quot; ultimately became one of the best-selling singles of 2014, selling over 10.9 million copies. Menzel has since reprised her role as Elsa in most tie-in media, including the &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video games, the short films &quot;Frozen Fever&quot; (2015) and &quot;Olaf&#x27;s Frozen Adventure&quot; (2017), the film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018), and the sequel &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019).

Menzel sang &quot;Let it Go&quot; at the 86th Academy Awards in March 2014, where the song eventually won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. While introducing her performance, actor John Travolta mispronounced her name as &quot;Adele Dazeem&quot;; the mispronunciation was widely ridiculed by fans and the media, and subsequently became a viral Internet meme. Although initially thrown off by the incident, Menzel was not upset about the mishap, and credits it with introducing her to a wider audience. To promote her then-current role in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;If/Then&quot;, the production printed satirical playbills that credited Menzel as Adele Dazeem, and referenced her previous credits in &quot;Nert&quot; (&quot;Rent&quot;), &quot;Wicked-ly&quot; (&quot;Wicked&quot;), and &quot;Farfignugen&quot; (&quot;Frozen&quot;). Shortly after the ceremony, Travolta publicly apologized to Menzel. At the 87th Academy Awards the following year, Menzel presented Best Original Song with Travolta and jokingly introduced him as &quot;Glom Gazingo&quot;, who finally pronounced her name correctly upon joining her on stage.

Although Menzel had already been well known within the Broadway community prior to working with Disney, she was not as recognized outside of her stage credits. The success of &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Let it Go&quot;, and the Oscars incident are credited with establishing Menzel as an international superstar, helping bolster her film and music careers beyond musical theatre. She considers Travolta mispronouncing her name to be &quot;one of the best things that happened for my career&quot;.

In 2015, Menzel was slated to star on the Ellen DeGeneres–produced sitcom &quot;Happy Time&quot;, which would have been her first television role since &quot;Glee&quot;. However, the project never came to fruition.

==== Film actress (2017–present) ====
Following the success of &quot;Frozen&quot;, Menzel continued to pursue more prominent roles in film and television projects. She starred as CC Bloom, a role originated by one of her idols Bette Midler, in Lifetime&#x27;s 2017 remake of the 1988 film &quot;Beaches&quot;. The melodrama follows the decades-long friendship and rivalry between a brassy singer (Menzel) and a reserved lawyer, played by Nia Long. Due to her typical avoidance of revivals and fondness for the original film, Menzel was initially hesitant to star in the project, but ultimately embraced the remake as an opportunity to introduce a classic story about female friendship to a younger generation. The remake was conceived around Menzel&#x27;s singing career in a similar manner to how the original incorporated Midler&#x27;s, whose songs she covered for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Premiering to mixed reviews, several critics found the remake inferior to the original, but praised Menzel&#x27;s musical contributions. CNN&#x27;s Brian Lowry said &quot;the lure of providing Menzel an opportunity to let loose on these familiar tunes is more than enough to qualify as a win for Lifetime, even if the movie itself ... never achieves liftoff&quot;. Katie Rife of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Linda Holmes of NPR, and MaryAnn Sleasman of &quot;TV Guide&quot; each found Menzel&#x27;s acting adequate but lacking the conviction and humor Midler brought to the role, resulting in a less compelling version of the same character.

In 2019, she starred opposite Adam Sandler in the crime thriller &quot;Uncut Gems&quot;, playing his character&#x27;s estranged and frustrated wife Dinah Ratner. The role was considered a stark departure for Menzel, who longed to be involved in a project that differed from the family-friendly material she had become synonymous with. Directors Josh and Benny Safdie cast her based on her performance as a similar character in &quot;Skintight&quot;, and Menzel drew upon personal experience for the role, having grown up around confident women like Dinah in New York. She described Dinah as &quot;the voice for how the audience feels as they&#x27;re going through this roller-coaster ride&quot; and avoided devolving her into merely a stereotype. The film and Menzel&#x27;s performance drew critical acclaim. Writing for &quot;The Post and Courier&quot;, Jocelyn Noveck found Menzel &quot;compelling in the rare role that doesn&#x27;t make use of her famous singing voice&quot;, while Johnny Oleksinski of the &quot;New York Post&quot; called her &quot;delightfully abrasive&quot;.

In 2021, Menzel co-starred alongside Camila Cabello, Billy Porter, and James Corden in Kay Cannon&#x27;s jukebox musical adaptation of the Cinderella fairy tale, playing Cinderella&#x27;s (Cabello) unkind stepmother Vivian. Despite admiring actresses who had played the villainous role prior, Menzel wanted to eschew &quot;the archetypal kind of idea of the straight-ahead evil nemesis&quot; in order to uncover the trauma behind the character&#x27;s cruel nature. In addition to performing several covers for the film, Menzel wrote and recorded an original song for her character entitled &quot;Dream Girl&quot;, which was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. &quot;Cinderella&quot; received mixed reviews, but Menzel&#x27;s performance was praised: &quot;IndieWire&quot;&#x27;s Kristen Lopez said she played the character &quot;deliciously&quot;, while Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described Menzel as &quot;her usual spectacular self&quot; and &quot;arguably the most nuanced and empathetic &#x27;evil&#x27; stepmother in &#x27;Cinderella&#x27; history&quot;. Michael Calleri of the &quot;Niagara Gazette&quot; said Menzel delivers the film&#x27;s best performance.

In 2022, Menzel reprised her role as Nancy in the &quot;Enchanted&quot; sequel &quot;Disenchanted&quot;. Now the Queen of Anadalasia as Edward&#x27;s (James Marsden) wife, Menzel&#x27;s character sings for the first time, in addition to serving as the film&#x27;s &quot;voice of reason&quot;. A pop version of Menzel&#x27;s song, &quot;Love Power&quot;, was released as the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single in November 2022. &quot;Disenchanted&quot; received mixed reviews; most critics appreciated hearing Menzel sing, while others found her role brief and her song unmemorable. Marya E. Gates of RogerEbert.com called Menzel&#x27;s performance &quot;one of the few that manages to transcend beyond the subpar trappings of&quot; the film, lamenting that she is &quot;relegated to only a handful of scenes&quot;. She also starred in an episode of the HGTV show &quot;Celebrity I.O.U.&quot; with the Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott. In this episode, she helped the brothers renovate a garage for her friend James.

In 2023, Menzel played Bree Friedman in the coming-of-age comedy &quot;You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah&quot;, reuniting with Sandler&quot;.&quot; Directed by Sammi Cohen, the film co-stars Menzel and Sandler as Jewish parents raising an adolescent girl as they prepare for her bat mitzvah. Menzel had previously played Sandler&#x27;s wife in &quot;Uncut Gems&quot;, while Sandler&#x27;s real-life wife and children also co-star in &quot;You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Gary Goldstein said Menzel fits in well among Sandler&#x27;s own family, while Matthew Jackson of &quot;The A. V. Club&quot; said the duo make &quot;a wonderful (and wonderfully grumpy) couple&quot;. Abhishek Srivastava of &quot;The Times of India&quot; said Menzel &quot;comes across as extremely authentic and hits all the right notes&quot;.

She also starred in &quot;American Murderer&quot; directed by Matthew Gentile. During the ongoing time of the COVID-19 pandemic, Menzel created and launched a brand new YouTube web series for children entitled &quot;Idina&#x27;s Treehouse&quot;. The series featured Menzel from her treehouse out in her Los Angeles home that originally was built for her son Walker Nathaniel Diggs. It features a full set of songs, stories, and appearances from Menzel&#x27;s family and friends. In 2024, alongside Chenoweth, Menzel made a cameo appearance during the &quot;One Short Day&quot; sequence in the film adaptation of &quot;Wicked.&quot;

== Artistry ==

=== Voice and influences ===

Menzel possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range that spans approximately three octaves. For the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Sharon Eberson wrote that Menzel&#x27;s voice &quot;could be categorized as coquettish to flat-out belter and everything in between—and with a stage presence to match—she usually is labeled a mezzo-soprano. But why pigeonhole someone so intriguingly offbeat?&quot; Eberson observed that she &quot;interprets songs as much as an actress as a singer,&quot; believing, &quot;therein lies her connection to the music and her fans.&quot; Describing Menzel as a loud soprano similar to Broadway actress Ethel Merman, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times &quot;wrote &quot;The sound she creates when she belts ... is a primal cry embedded in her being that insists that we listen and pay attention.&quot; Holden observed that her voice can alternate between &quot;babyish and demanding, or it can sound grand and imperial&quot; depending on the song choice. According to Andrew Gans of &quot;Playbill&quot;, Menzel has &quot;one of the most unique voices of her generation, a pliable alto that can be sweet and girlish in its middle register and then easily soar to pop-influenced top notes way above high C.&quot; &quot;Frozen&quot; songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez described Menzel&#x27;s voice as &quot;a warm hug&quot; with &quot;this warmth and this vulnerability down low. And then, as you bring her higher and higher, she gets stronger and stronger, and more powerful. She just reaches into your soul when she&#x27;s singing these big, giant songs.&quot;

Menzel is known for her signature high belting style; the Kennedy Center website cites Menzel as a prime example of a &quot;Broadway Belter&quot; who uses the technique to her advantage. Theater critic Charles Isherwood said the singer &quot;has a voice that is very much her own,&quot; describing it as &quot;totally distinctive&quot; with &quot;a great belt and a great range.&quot; Describing Menzel&#x27;s voice as &quot;husky ... which sometimes veers toward shrieking until she effortlessly reins herself in or, amazingly, kicks it up another notch,&quot; Melissa Ruggieri of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; believes she possesses &quot;a superior instrument&quot; both live and in-studio. Explaining her own technique, Menzel said she avoids moving her shoulders while singing and prefers &quot;to take a smaller breath for a bigger, longer note because there&#x27;s less air that will come pummeling out.&quot; She also maintains her voice by constantly steaming and practicing vocal warm ups, describing her routine as &quot;very ritualistic&quot; and &quot;disciplined&quot;. Despite her live vocals earning consistent acclaim, some critics have criticized Menzel&#x27;s belting for sounding &quot;screechy&quot;. Schuyler Velasco of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; observed that the singer &quot;made a career out of belting notes that would fry the vocal chords of mere mortals&quot;, but felt the emotion of her performances sometimes suffers at the hands of her vocal proficiency. Velasco cited her rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Super Bowl XLIX as an example of Menzel sacrificing excitement and inspiration for technique, yet delivering an adequate performance nonetheless. Menzel addressed such criticisms during a 2014 concert, explaining that she wishes to sing loud, proud and &quot;from the heart&quot; like her idols Merman and Aretha Franklin. Tim Smith of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that Menzel&#x27;s &quot;high-wattage vocal cords and intense phrasing ... [make] a mark whenever she sings.&quot; Menzel admits that she finds some of her most famous songs challenging, namely songs from the &quot;Frozen&quot; films, which &quot;push her to vocal extremes&quot; and require constant warming up and sometimes lowering the key for live performances. The term &quot;powerhouse&quot; has often been used in the media to describe Menzel&#x27;s vocal ability.

Menzel&#x27;s vocal style has drawn comparisons to singer Barbra Streisand, whose song &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot; she often covers, including in tribute to her at the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors. Menzel said she had long aspired to have a career as successful as Streisand to whose Jewish upbringing Menzel has also been compared, with fans deeming her &quot;the next big Jewish icon in music&quot;. Menzel was particularly inspired by Streisand&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;A Star is Born&quot; (1976), and cites singers Franklin, Billie Holiday, Etta James, Chaka Khan and Sarah Vaughan among her vocal idols. Despite emulating her inspirations, Menzel claims she maintains the importance of &quot;finding [her] own voice.&quot; Some critics have dubbed Menzel &quot;the Streisand of her generation&quot;. Similar comparisons have been drawn between Menzel and singer Bette Midler.

=== Musical style ===
Professionally trained as a classical singer from age eight, Menzel decided to pursue different genres such as R&amp;B and jazz once she began high school. Upon becoming a wedding singer, Menzel was eventually exposed to a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from jazz to rock and Motown, and would often experiment with new arrangements of traditional songs. She credits her wedding singer background with training her to improvise new vocal arrangements, which in turn helps her ad-lib alternative versions of songs when she is feeling unwell or her voice is tired. Her set lists tend to incorporate an eclectic combination of original material and covers of popular pop, rock, musical theatre and film songs, selecting an assortment of songs she expects fans want to hear and feels inspired to attempt new interpretations of. Jay Handelman of the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; opined that Menzel&#x27;s song choices &quot;reinforce her own offbeat personality.&quot; According to Menzel, her song selections usually indicate a milestone, choosing to convey a stories and memories about her life using music. Menzel often opts to perform barefoot in concert, which has become a trademark of her live performances. She also enjoys conversing with audience members in-between musical performances. In addition to her vocal prowess, Menzel has been noted for her charming and witty banter; Smith described her as &quot;a pro at delivering stage banter and as quick on the draw with one-liners as seasoned stand-up comedians.&quot; On her stage presence, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; critic Ray Mark Rinaldi wrote that Menzel delivers &quot;the kind of self-assurance that can only come from beating out Kristin Chenoweth for a Tony. She comes out on stage, dressed like she doesn&#x27;t care, acting a little dizzy, but knowing all along she&#x27;s gonna hit the right notes.&quot;

Menzel has become closely associated with songs about self-empowerment, specifically her Signature Songs &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and &quot;Let it Go&quot;. &quot;Discussing Disney&quot; author Amy M. Davis believes Menzel&#x27;s voice &quot;has become associated with rebellion for Broadway fans.&quot; However, the artist claims such themes have made her feel fraudulent at times because she herself does not always feel empowered. Subsequently, she began incorporating more emotional material into her sets, such as Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot;. Although Menzel co-writes most of her own material as a singer-songwriter, she considers herself a collaborator rather than a songwriter, explaining that she prefers working with professional songwriters or producers: &quot;They start playing some music, and I like to sing… I can sing melodies, I come up with titles and lyrical ideas, but I&#x27;m really not good at making decisions.&quot; She has frequently collaborated with songwriter and producer Glen Ballard, and tends to draw upon lyrics from her personal diary and melodies from a tape recorder. Menzel claims she has never completed writing a song entirely on her own, finding the process to be too stressful: &quot;I never had a good song that I wrote, so to ... act like I&#x27;m this great songwriter, I would be just a fraud. But, I&#x27;m good at bringing myself to it—being a good collaborator in the room.&quot; She cites Joni Mitchell and Annie Lennox among her musical influences, describing them as &quot;singer-songwriters who had these amazing voices but also were incredible storytellers and lyricists&quot;, while expressing admiration for musicians Bono, Sting and Seal. &quot;The Ithacan&quot;&#x27;s Preston Arment observed that &quot;what Menzel may lack in songwriting ability, she makes up for with stunning vocals that remind us why listeners will never stop loving her.&quot; AllMusic biographer Marcy Donelson described Menzel&#x27;s studio albums as a combination of Adult Alternative, vocal, and contemporary pop music. Menzel&#x27;s fifth studio album, which she considers to be her most personal to-date, contains a combination of ballads and upbeat tracks that explore themes about home, personal loss, empowerment, relationships and starting over, much of which was inspired by her divorce from Taye Diggs. Bailey Flynn of &quot;The Heights&quot; believes the album demonstrates several trademarks for which Menzel has become known: &quot;power ballads that give her huge vocal range and mind-blowing control all the chance they need to show off.&quot;

Menzel described performing her own songs live as &quot;scarier&quot; than singing covers or songs from established shows because &quot;You&#x27;re a little bit more transparent. There&#x27;s no costume or character I&#x27;m hiding behind ... yet sometimes it&#x27;s more rewarding because of that&quot;, describing the feeling of hearing fans sing songs she has written herself as &quot;incredible&quot;.

== Legacy and public image ==
Menzel has been called one of Broadway&#x27;s greatest performers. Tim Beedle of DC.com declared her &quot;arguably the most widely recognized Broadway star in the country&quot;. Several media publications have nicknamed her the &quot;Queen of Broadway&quot; due to her success and impact on the genre. Often described as one of the defining singing voices of her generation, Apple Music referred to her as &quot;one of the 21st century&#x27;s premier vocalists&quot;. Jenny Singer of &quot;Glamour&quot; declared Menzel one of history&#x27;s greatest musical theatre vocalists, while Valerie Complex of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; called her an influential performer who has &quot;left an indelible mark on the industry&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;&#x27;s Jim Slotek dubbed her &quot;this generation&#x27;s Broadway icon&quot;. In a 2020 retrospective, Cleveland.com&#x27;s Troy L. Smith named Menzel the best vocalist of 2013, claiming the success of that year&#x27;s &quot;Let it Go&quot; only cemented her legacy as &quot;one of Broadway&#x27;s greatest stars of all time&quot;. The previous year, BroadwayWorld recognized Menzel as one of the decade&#x27;s 10 most influential Broadway stars. &quot;Time Out&quot; ranked Menzel the 19th greatest female Broadway actress of all time, observing that she established a &quot;stratospheric reputation&quot; largely based on the popularity of only two roles: &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Wicked&quot;. &quot;Vulture&quot;&#x27;s Jackson McHenry attributed the popularity and endurance of &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; to Menzel, believing few singers can service the song as successfully as she has. In 2018, NPR named &quot;Let it Go&quot; one of the 200 greatest female-performed songs of the 21st century, at number 182.

Menzel&#x27;s successful crossover from stage actor to television, film, and music star have been discussed at length, with &quot;Redbook&quot; dubbing her &quot;One of [Broadway&#x27;s] biggest crossover success stories&quot;. Menzel&#x27;s biography on Starz described her as the kind of stage-to-screen star Broadway seldom produces anymore. Marty Hughley of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; shared a similar sentiment, writing in 2012 that although Broadway does not guarantee global superstardom as often as it used to, Menzel is &quot;a notable exception to the rule of Broadway’s declining clout&quot;. Original Broadway cast recordings of &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;If/Then&quot;, both albums prominently featuring Menzel as a soloist, debuted within the top-20 of the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. In a 2014 article, &quot;Billboard&quot; theorized that Menzel&#x27;s crossover success &quot;bodes well for Broadway&#x27;s would-be stars&quot;, believing &quot;Let it Go&quot; &quot;kicked open the door for future composers of stage and screen&quot;. When Menzel returned to Broadway in 2014 shortly after the success of &quot;Frozen&quot;, Suzy Evans of &quot;Billboard&quot; observed that audience reception was more akin to that of a &quot;rock star&quot; than a musical theatre performer. Menzel&#x27;s fanbase has nicknamed themselves &quot;Fanzels&quot;. In addition to her perceived authenticity, Isherwood attributes the artist&#x27;s large following to the successes of &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Wicked&quot;: &quot;two era-defying, hugely successful Broadway musicals&quot;. &quot;Toronto Star&quot; theatre critic Richard Ouzounian credits the same two shows with solidifying her reputation as one of the industry&#x27;s &quot;most dynamic musical theatre stars&quot;. She has been described as &quot;Broadway royalty&quot;, due to a combination of her successful stage career and playing royalty in several Disney projects.

According to Akiva Gottlieb of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Menzel&#x27;s public persona is largely defined by her performances in &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Wicked&quot;, and recording Christmas albums. As an actress, Menzel has earned a reputation for playing misunderstood characters both on stage and in film, admitting she gravitates towards complex roles. She cited power and vulnerability as common traits among characters she has played. According to the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Menzel has become &quot;a go-to actress for producers looking for a feisty female lead&quot;, while &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s Courtney Shea said she &quot;forged her career playing strong and sensational females&quot;. Menzel believes Broadway has always offered compelling roles for women of all ages, whereas she considers Hollywood to be more susceptible to ageism and sexism. Menzel is revered as a role model for young women, particularly due to her role as Elsa which has contributed her a large following among predominantly female &quot;Frozen&quot; fans. Although she takes her responsibility as a role model seriously, she has stated that she does not always feel like a role model in her personal life and feels uncomfortable bearing the responsibility at times. Menzel has a prominent gay following, dating back to the 1990s when she starred in &quot;Rent&quot;. &quot;Rent&quot; was also one of the first Broadway shows to show a lesbian relationship. The performer attributes this to playing several repressed characters who are &quot;hiding something within them that they’re afraid to let people see, and then finally they embrace it&quot;. Michael Heaton, a critic for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, noted that some parents have expressed concerns about the &quot;blue humor&quot; Menzel uses in her typical concerts in an attempt to appeal to both her adult gay and young fans.

Diana Bunici of Evoke.ie dubbed Menzel &quot;the voice of the new generation&quot;. In 2014, Menzel was awarded &quot;Breakthrough Artist&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2019, Menzel and actress Kristen Bell, who plays her sister in &quot;Frozen&quot;, received neighboring stars—Menzel&#x27;s was the 2682nd and Bell&#x27;s was the 2681st—on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Menzel was inducted into the live theatre category. Menzel is also among the wealthiest Broadway performers, due in part to her television, film and music careers. In 2022, Menzel was announced as a recipient of a Disney Legends Award for her outstanding contributions to the Walt Disney Company, with her D23 entry reading &quot;Whether on stage or screen, Idina Menzel’s unequivocal signature talents have shone through countless projects across her almost 30-year career&quot;. In October 2024, President Joe Biden awarded Menzel with the National Medal of Arts.

She was the 2022 recipient of the National Medal of Arts. Menzel received an honorary doctorate from University of Pennsylvania in 2023.

== Personal life ==
Menzel married Taye Diggs on January 11, 2003. They met in 1995 during the original production of &quot;Rent&quot;, in which Diggs portrayed Benjamin Coffin III, the landlord. They would appear in several films together. On September 2, 2009, she gave birth to their son. In late 2013, it was reported that Menzel and Diggs had separated after 10 years of marriage. Menzel cited negative public reaction to the &quot;interracial aspect&quot; of their marriage as a factor in the divorce, as well as other unnamed &quot;complicated reasons.&quot; The two continued to co-parent their son.

Menzel began dating actor Aaron Lohr, and in August 2015, they bought a home together in Encino, Los Angeles. On September 23, 2016, Menzel announced that she and Lohr were engaged. They were married September 22, 2017, in a backyard ceremony at their home.

Menzel identifies as a feminist, saying, &quot;I love that I play all of these strong women. But they&#x27;re not just strong—they&#x27;re women who have a really deep vulnerability and need to go through a journey in order to harness their power.&quot;

== Philanthropy and other ventures ==
Menzel was an honorary chair of the Imperial Court of New York&#x27;s Annual Charity Coronation Ball, Night of A Thousand Gowns, on March 21, 2009, sharing the title with Elton John, Patti LuPone, John Cameron Mitchell, Joan Rivers, and Robin Strasser.

On May 17, 2009, Menzel performed at a special benefit concert in Atlanta, Georgia, to raise money for the Pace Academy Diversity Program in coordination with the Ron Clark Academy. The event resulted in the funding of two scholarships for Ron Clark Academy students to attend Pace Academy. The event was organized and hosted by Philip McAdoo, a former &quot;Rent&quot; cast member and current Diversity Program Director at Pace Academy.

In 2010, Menzel founded the A BroaderWay Foundation with then-husband Taye Diggs as a means of supporting young people in the arts. A BroaderWay sponsors camp programs, theater workshops, and innovative educational programming, and offers scholarships and opportunities to experience professional performances. In Summer 2011, Camp BroaderWay welcomed girls from under-served metro New York communities to a 10-day performing arts camp, run by Menzel and a team of acclaimed professional Broadway artists including Taye Diggs. During this camp, the girls collaborated with Broadway artists to write an original musical that was performed at a theatre in New York. The camp was held at Belvoir Terrace Summer Camp in Lenox, Massachusetts.

Menzel has long-championed LGBT rights by partnering with organizations like The Trevor Project, the Give A Damn Campaign (filming a public service announcement and designing a T-shirt) and the NOH8 Campaign, posing for one of their trademark duct-taped silence photos.

In April 2014, Menzel presented at Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS Easter Bonnet Competition with Bryan Cranston, Fran Drescher, and Denzel Washington, after raising donations at her Broadway show &quot;If/Then&quot;.

In 2022, Menzel had launched a clothing line with QVC called &quot;Encore by Idina Menzel&quot;. Also in 2022, Menzel co-wrote a children&#x27;s book with her sister, Cara Mentzel, called &quot;Loud Mouse&quot; with illustrations by Jaclyn Sinquett. The book is semi-autobiographical about a mouse named Dee who loves to sing loudly. The book was published by Disney-Hyperion on September 27, 2022. In promotion of the book, Menzel released &quot;The Loud Mouse Song&quot;, which she co-wrote with Laura Veltz, on September 23, 2022. In 2023, Menzel and her sister Cara Mentzel released a sequel to &quot;Loud Mouse&quot;, called &quot;Proud Mouse&quot;, with Jaclyn Sinquett returning for illustrations.

Following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, on November 20, 2023, Menzel performed at AMIT&#x27;s Evening of Solidarity with the Children of Israel in Sony Hall in Manhattan, recognizing donors who supported AMIT&#x27;s network of religious Jewish educational institutions in Israel.

<text>Truro Anglican Church is an Anglican church in Fairfax, Virginia, USA.

==History of Truro Church (1845-1948)==
There was no official Episcopal Church in the City of Fairfax until the Rev. Richard Templeton Brown, rector of The Falls Church, organized a congregation in 1843. The congregation first met at the historic Fairfax Courthouse and then moved to the private home of Mrs. William Rumsey, a Baptist from New York. There were fourteen communicants. A year later, a plain white frame church was built on the present site of the Truro Chapel and was consecrated as Zion Church in 1845.

As Union troops advanced into Virginia at the outset of the Civil War, the congregation was forced to abandon Zion Church. During the Civil War, Zion Church was first used as a storehouse for munitions and then was destroyed. The house that is now the Gunnell House (at that time a private residence) was used as the Union headquarters by General Stoughton until 1863 when he was captured in the middle of the night by Confederate Captain John Mosby. Graffiti written by the officers stationed in the house was found on the walls in a closet on the third floor and is now on display at the Fairfax Museum.

In 1882, the house was purchased for use as a rectory. At that time it was half the size it is today and was enlarged to its present form in 1911. It served as the residence of the rector of the Episcopal Church in Fairfax until 1991 when it served first as a home for single mothers and their babies (NOEL House) and then as the offices for Truro Church. Presently, the Gunnell House is used as office and meeting space for the church.

At the close of the Civil War, the congregation of Zion Church re-formed and began to meet in the Fairfax Courthouse. Zion Church was rebuilt and consecrated in 1878.

Zion Church remained in active use from 1875 through 1933, when a new church (now the Chapel) was built to serve the growing congregation of 100 parishioners, under the leadership of the Rev. Herbert Donovan. Designed to replicate the old Payne&#x27;s Church on Ox Road, the new church was consecrated on May 1, 1934, as Truro Episcopal Church. The old Zion Church building was used as the Parish Hall until it burned down in 1952.

==Truro Church (1948-2001)==
The Rev. Raymond Davis was installed as rector of Truro in 1948. He said that he would be pleased if he could, just once, fill all one hundred seats of the little brick church. Not only were all the seats filled, but the growing congregation began to burst at the seams as the great suburban expansion of Northern Virginia began in the 1950s. In 1959, a new and larger church was completed with a seating capacity of 500. The congregation first worshiped in the new church on Palm Sunday, 1959, and when the mortgage was paid off in 1974, a new Truro Church building was consecrated. The old church building is now known as the Chapel. Numerous services are still held throughout the week in the historic chapel, including contemporary worship services.

In 1967, a small group of Truro parishioners (who had been meeting together for Bible study and prayer) began a mission church called the Church of the Apostles, now located east of Truro on Pickett Road.

In 1976 the Rev. John W. Howe was installed as rector. Under his leadership Truro continued to experience physical expansion as well as spiritual renewal. The church seating capacity was expanded by 300 through the addition of the transepts in 1983. Truro also expanded its engagement in mission around the world. Another mission church, the Church of the Epiphany, was established in Herndon, Virginia in 1985, with the Rev. Bill Reardon as rector.

From the 1970s onward, Truro became a bastion of conservatism in the Episcopal Church. It was very active in the anti-abortion movement, and also started a conversion therapy program to convert homosexuals. This prompted many of the church&#x27;s more liberal members to leave, replaced by more conservative Christians from other denominations. By the turn of the century, fewer than 40 percent of Truro&#x27;s members had been raised as Episcopalian.

In 1991, the Rev. Martyn Minns was installed as rector of Truro Church. He emphasized an evangelical call to worldwide mission and outreach to the poor, as well as biblical theology. Under his leadership the Lamb Center was established, offering social services, prayer, and practical encouragement to the homeless in Fairfax, and the work of TIPS Truro&#x27;s International Programs and Services was expanded. A new mission church, Christ the Redeemer Church, was launched in western Fairfax County with the Rev. Tom Herrick as vicar in 1994. Most recently, Truro birthed another mission church in Loudoun County, the Church of the Holy Spirit in 2001, with the Rev. Clancy Nixon as vicar. The Rev. Martyn Minns was made an honorary canon of All Saints&#x27; Cathedral, Mpwapwa, Tanzania in 2002; he was consecrated as a bishop by Archbishop Peter Akinola in 2006.

==21st century==
Following the Protocol for Departing Congregations created by the Diocese of Virginia, Truro Church embarked on 40 Days of Discernment to consider its future in the Episcopal Church (TEC). This time of discernment led to a parish vote where the entire membership voted on whether to leave the Episcopal Church because of the ordination of Bishop Gene Robinson, the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church. On Sunday, December 17, 2006, 92 percent of the individual members of Truro Episcopal Church membership voted to withdraw from the Episcopal Church and join the Convocation of Anglicans in North America (CANA), a mission initiative of the Anglican Church of Nigeria (a province in the worldwide Anglican Communion), but an entity that is not a branch of the Episcopal Church, under the leadership of the Rt. Rev. Martyn Minns, Missionary Bishop of CANA. Joining Truro were other individuals from eleven other parishes in the Diocese of Virginia who also voted to leave the Episcopal Church and join CANA. CANA is a member of the Common Cause Partnership, which also includes the American Anglican Council, the Anglican Coalition in Canada, the Anglican Communion Network, the Anglican Essentials Canada, the Anglican Mission in America, the Anglican Network in Canada, the Anglican Province of America, Forward in Faith North America. and the Reformed Episcopal Church. In June 2008, Truro was represented at the Global Anglican Future in Jerusalem.

The leaving members of Truro initiated the first legal proceedings under a Virginia &quot;departure&quot; statute. Thereafter, TEC initiated legal proceedings in Virginia to determine the ownership of the facilities. Initially a Virginia Circuit Court judge agreed with CANA regarding technical points about whether the TEC was qualified to bring the action, and the case of real property ownership was not decided. TEC appealed, and on June 10, 2010, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned the decision of the circuit court, specifically finding that the Virginia statute on which the departing members relied did not apply because the departing members had not joined a &quot;branch&quot; of the same denomination. In 2012, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County decided the suit on remand, in combination with several other Northern Virginia TEC property splitting actions. Applying the neutral principles of law doctrine, the court upheld TEC&#x27;s Constitution and Canons and ordered that CANA and the trustees of the withdrawn churches &quot;promptly relinquish control over the properties to the [TEC] Diocese.&quot; Subsequently, an &quot;unexpected&quot; friendship between Rev. Tory Baucum of Truro Church and the Rev. Shannon Johnston, Bishop of the Diocese of Virginia, resulted in a situation in 2014 where &quot;...the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia and Truro Church have settled their litigation and forged an amicable truce.

<text>Jarndyce and Jarndyce (or Jarndyce v Jarndyce) is a fictional probate case in &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1852–53) by Charles Dickens, progressing in the English Court of Chancery. The case is a central plot device in the novel and has become a byword for seemingly interminable legal proceedings. 

Dickens refers to the case as &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;, the way it would be spoken of. The &quot;v&quot; in the case title is an abbreviation of the Latin &quot;&quot;, but is normally pronounced &quot;and&quot; for civil cases in England and Wales.

==Plot==
&quot;Jarndyce v Jarndyce&quot; concerns the fate of a large inheritance; due to the apparent existence of multiple wills and trusts deriving therefrom (with those containing multiple beneficiaries), the heir or heirs cannot be determined. The case has dragged on for many generations before the action of the novel, so that, by the end of the narrative when the correct heirs appear to have finally been established, legal costs have devoured the whole estate, rendering any ultimate verdict moot. Dickens used it to attack the chancery court system as being almost completely worthless, as any &quot;honourable man among its practitioners&quot; says, &quot;Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come here!&quot;

All of the main characters are connected in some way through the case, though the legal proceedings appear only as a background plot. Aside from the lawyers who sue and defend the case, every character who directly associates with it suffers some tragic fate. Miss Flite has long since lost her mind when the narrative begins. Richard Carstone, a former ward of court, dies trying to win the inheritance for himself after spending much of his life so distracted by the notion of it that he cannot commit to any other pursuit. John Jarndyce, by contrast, finds the whole process tiresome and tries to have as little to do with it as he possibly can, one of many examples of the character&#x27;s wise and self-effacing demeanour.

Dickens introduces the case in the in terms which make the futility of the matter clear:

The ending of the case reduces the whole court to fits of laughter. From :

==Real-life cases==

In the preface to &quot;Bleak House&quot;, Dickens cites two Chancery cases as special inspirations, one of which was a &quot;friendly suit&quot;:

Based on an 1853 letter of Dickens, the first of these cases has been identified as the dispute over the will of Charles Day, a boot blacking manufacturer who died in 1836. Proceedings were commenced in 1837 and not concluded until at least 1854. 

The second of these cases is generally identified as the dispute over the will of the &quot;Acton Miser&quot; William Jennens of Acton, Suffolk. &quot;Jennens v Jennens&quot; commenced in 1798 and was abandoned in 1915 (117 years later) when the legal fees had exhausted the Jennens estate of funds; thus it had been ongoing for 55 years when &quot;Bleak House&quot; was published.

Some commentators have theorised that the &quot;Jarndyce v Jarndyce&quot; case was inspired by the dispute over the will of Richard Smith, a West India merchant. When he died in 1776, the estate was tied up, and his daughter-in-law Charlotte Smith was pushed by financial necessity to write for money; she became a much-praised poet. That Chancery case has been reported to have taken 36 years to get through the court, although this may not be correct.

Another theory holds that the case is partly based on that of &quot;Wedderburn v Wedderburn&quot;, which ran from 1831 until 1857.

Others have cited the case of &quot;Thellusson v Woodford&quot; as the real-life basis but though it related to the will of a man who died in 1797 the suit was not actually filed until after the book was published.

The will of Sir George Downing, who stipulated that his fortune be used to build for a new college at Cambridge, resulted in a lawsuit which lasted for more than 40 years, until March 1800.

==Cultural references==
More than a century after the novel&#x27;s publication, &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; continues to be used as an example of the futility and length of civil court cases. For example, Lord Denning, when referring to &quot;Midland Bank v Green&quot;, said, &quot;The &quot;Green&quot; saga rivals in time and money the story of &quot;Jarndyce v Jarndyce&quot;.&quot;

In the &quot;Ampthill Peerage case&quot;, where a disputed claim to a peerage involved reopening issues which had seemingly been settled in a judgment delivered fifty years earlier, Lord Simon of Glaisdale spoke strongly of the need for finality in litigation. He reminded his fellow Law Lords that &quot;Jarndyce v Jarndyce&quot;, and the pitiful character of Miss Flite, driven mad by the strain of unending litigation, were inspired by real events.

By 2015, the case had been referred to nine times by the U.S. Supreme Court and over 333 times by state and federal courts. It is referred to (indirectly by reference to &quot;Bleak House&quot;) in the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Stern v. Marshall&quot;, a protracted lawsuit over an estate.

In the film version of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;Orlando&quot;, a court case concerning Orlando&#x27;s right to his/her estate began during the reign of Queen Anne (1702–1714) is completed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II (1952–2022). The length of the case is made humorous by the fact that Orlando, a party to the lawsuit, remains alive for its entire duration.

The case is mentioned in David Graeber&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot; as a paradigm of long-lasting court disputes which bespeak the self-serving desire of problem-solving professionals (not only lawyers but also independent auditors and financial advisers) to prolong and multiply otherwise solvable problems as a way to preserve their jobs. The 1852 case was remembered in the context of the 2006 payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal in the United Kingdom, for which &quot;banks were found to have been unloading unwanted and often wildly disadvantageous account insurance policies on their clients.&quot; According to Graeber, &quot;the result was an entire new industry organized around resolving PPI claims,&quot; leading banks to enter into contracts with professionals and firms intent on making sure the problem was never actually solved, because they eyed the &quot;vast sums set aside by the bank to pay compensation for the PPI&quot;.

<doc id="794716" wikidata="Q1285806" url="?curid=794716" title="NFL Network">
<text>NFL Network (occasionally abbreviated on-air as NFLN) is an American sports-oriented pay television network owned by the National Football League NTP and is part of NFL Media, which also includes NFL.com, NFL Films, NFL Mobile, NFL Now and NFL RedZone. Dedicated to American football, the network features game telecasts from the NFL, as well as NFL-related content including analysis programs, specials and documentaries. The network is headquartered in the NFL Los Angeles building located next to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, and broadcasts its worldwide feed from Encompass Digital Media (formerly Crawford Communications, and Broadcast Facilities Inc.) in Atlanta, Georgia. The network has secondary East Coast facilities in the NFL Films building in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. 

, NFL Network was available to approximately 71.10 million television households in the United States (totaling 61.9000% of U.S. households with at least one television set). , the channel was available in 51.5 million homes as cord cutting continues to affect the industry.

== History ==
NFL Network was launched on November 4, 2003, only eight months after the owners of the league&#x27;s 32 teams voted unanimously to approve its formation. Originally located in the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City, California, the league invested $100 million to fund the network&#x27;s operations. NFL Films, which produces commercials, television programs, and feature films for the NFL, is a key supplier of NFL Network&#x27;s programming, with more than 4,000 hours of footage available in its library. As a result, much of the network&#x27;s highlights and recaps feature NFL Films&#x27; trademark style of slow-motion game action, sounds of the game, and sideline conversations between players and/or team staff. Both the network&#x27;s site and app, were launched in 2004 (on NFL.com) and 2009, respectively.

Beginning with the 2006 season, the network began to broadcast eight regular-season NFL games during Thursday prime time, branded as &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;. In addition to live games, the network has provided coverage of the NFL draft since 2006; its coverage competes with that provided by ESPN and ESPN2. It was simulcast in a co-production with Fox Sports for the 2018 edition, though this was only a one-year agreement as exclusive over-the-air broadcast rights moved to ABC for the 2019 edition, which saw ESPN produce a different broadcast for &#x27;casual&#x27; fans. In 2020, the network simulcast ESPN&#x27;s coverage of that year&#x27;s draft which was produced remotely from the basement of commissioner Roger Goodell’s home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On September 8, 2021, the network moved with the rest of NFL Media to a space on the campus of Hollywood Park, a development that also features SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. In addition to office and studio space, the facility also features NFL Media&#x27;s first outdoor studio and space to host studio audiences.

== Branding ==
At the 2008 NFL draft, NFL Network unveiled a revised logo that was updated to match the revised NFL logo introduced around the same time. Unlike the updated logo for the league, the NFL Network&#x27;s logo included subtle changes such as using a darker shade of blue and changing the &quot;NFL&quot; lettering to match that of the new league logo. During the 2012 NFL draft, the network debuted an overhauled logo resembling that used by sister network NFL Red Zone; the network also began to play down the &quot;HD&quot; branding used on-air, as the vast majority of cable providers currently carrying NFL Network transmit the channel&#x27;s standard definition feed as a downscaled letterboxed version of the high definition feed. The logo, as with those of all NFL properties, was tinted gold during the 2015 NFL season in commemoration of Super Bowl 50.

The network unveiled an updated ticker at the start of the 2017 season, replacing the one used since the 2012 rebranding. It would be changed again for the start of the 2023 season.

== Programming ==
=== NFL game telecasts ===
NFL Network introduced original game broadcasts in the 2006 season via the &quot;Run to the Playoffs&quot;—a late-season package of Thursday- and Saturday-night games, branded as &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Football&quot; respectively. After most Saturday games were dropped from the package beginning in the 2008 season, all of the games were branded as &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; regardless of night beginning in 2009. Starting with the 2012 season, &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; expanded to include a weekly game from Weeks 2 through 15 (excluding the Kickoff Game and Thanksgiving Day, which is held by NBC), as well as one Saturday night game during Week 16. As a result, every NFL team now appears in at least one timeslot-exclusive nationally televised game per-season.

As with the games broadcast by ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, the NFL Network telecasts are also aired on a designated broadcast television station in the primary markets of the participating teams, although prior to the suspension of blackout rules in 2015 stations in the home team&#x27;s market only carried it if the televised game sold out all remaining available tickets 72 hours prior to the game&#x27;s start time.

When &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; premiered, veteran television announcer Bryant Gumbel served as play-by-play announcer, with former Fox and current NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth serving as color commentator for the broadcasts. Collinsworth won the Sports Emmy for best game analyst for his work on the NFL Network telecasts. Dick Vermeil replaced Collinsworth for two games in 2006; Marshall Faulk and Deion Sanders replaced Collinsworth when needed in 2007.

In the 2014 NFL season, the NFL established a sub-licensing agreement with CBS to increase the prominence of the &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; package, under which a portion of the package would air in simulcast on broadcast television, and CBS Sports would produce all games. Specific games would still be exclusive to NFL Network to comply with carriage agreements guaranteeing a minimum number of exclusive NFL broadcasts per-season. In 2016, NBC Sports also gained a portion of the package under a similar arrangement. Fox Sports took over the package from 2018 to 2022. With Amazon Prime Video taking over exclusive rights to &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; beginning in the 2022 season, NFL Network switched to a package consisting primarily of Sunday morning NFL International Series games, and late-season Saturday games.

==== Preseason coverage ====
NFL Network televises all 65 preseason games each August. Some of the games air live on the network; however, a majority of these contests air on a tape-delayed basis and use the local broadcast of one of the teams involved. Live preseason game broadcasts on NFL Network are blacked out in the home markets of both participating teams, where the game is broadcast on a local station; in those affected areas, an alternate feed of NFL Network is shown instead with a different preseason game, documentary programming, or a previously aired game.

Prior to 2014, NFL Network occasionally broadcast selected preseason games as special editions of &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;, such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New Orleans Saints in 2007 (NBC had opted out to carry the proposed China Bowl preseason game in Beijing, which was eventually cancelled).

=== Studio shows ===
On weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays during the off-season, &quot;Good Morning Football/Good Morning Football Weekend&quot; airs live from 7-10 am ET, followed by a repeat from 10 am-1 pm ET.

On Sundays during the NFL season, the &quot;NFL GameDay Morning&quot; pre-game show airs from 9 am-1 pm ET, &quot;NFL GameDay Live&quot; from 1-7:30 pm ET, &quot;NFL GameDay Highlights&quot; from 7:30-8:30 ET, &quot;NFL GameDay Prime&quot; from 8:30 pm–11:30 pm ET and NFL GamDay Final from 11:30 pm–12:30 am ET (though this schedule may change depending on if the network airs a 8:30 am ET International game).

On Thursdays, Mondays and anytime NFL Network airs a game, NFL GameDay Kickoff begins two hours prior to the game, with NFL GameDay Live airing during the game (for Thursdays and Mondays), or Live Game coverage (if it&#x27;s airing the game), with NFL GameDay Final airing after the game.

=== Other football ===

==== Arena Football League ====
NFL Network held the broadcast rights to the revived Arena Football League from 2010 to 2012. Starting with the 2010 season, the network broadcast a weekly &quot;Friday Night Football&quot; game each week during the regular season and playoff games at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time from March to August, in addition to rights to playoff games and the ArenaBowl. The NFL stated that unlike when the NFL last showed interest in arena football, there would be no attempts to buy into the league. Broadcasters for the games included Kurt Warner, Tom Waddle, Paul Burmeister, Fran Charles, Charles Davis and Ari Wolfe.

NFL Network ceased airing Arena Football League games partway through the 2012 season as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league. The season&#x27;s remaining games were carried on a tape delay before the network terminated the league broadcast contract outright at the end of the season; the rights were then obtained by CBS Sports Network.

In March, 2024 the NFL announced they would broadcast 30 regular season games from the 2024 revival of the AFL on NFL Network. The league never carried any games, with West Texas Desert Hawks owner Zack Bugg accusing the network of malfeasance after he personally paid for one of his team&#x27;s games to be televised only for the network never to carry it. Another league member, the Albany Firebirds, indicated that the network had refused to carry the games because the league had a number of small-market teams (including West Texas) that &quot;scared (them) off.&quot; Oregon Blackbears president Patrick Johnson was among the league&#x27;s franchisees who was against the NFL Network deal, noting the predatory structure required the league to pay the network a brokerage fee but did not allow the league to sell advertising nor share in any advertising sales the network sold.

==== College football ====

In 2006, NFL Network began a foray into televising college football bowl games, acquiring rights to the newly established Texas Bowl in Houston (whose management rights were held by the Houston Texans at the time), the Insight Bowl, as well as two all-star events—the Senior Bowl (which features prospects that had completed their college eligibility) and the Las Vegas All-American Classic (which, however, was cancelled at the last minute due to financial and sponsorship issues). These games were intended to help make NFL Network more attractive to television providers. The 2006 Insight Bowl, played between Minnesota and Texas Tech, would also achieve notoriety for featuring the largest comeback victory in Division I FBS bowl game history, with Texas Tech coming back from a 38–7 third-quarter deficit to win 44–41 in overtime.

On April 14, 2007, the network televised the Nebraska Cornhuskers&#x27; spring football game. The network again aired the Insight, Texas and Senior bowls in late 2007 and early 2008. In addition, it carried two games between historically black colleges and universities during the 2007 season, including the Circle City Classic at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rights to the Insight and Texas Bowls were later acquired by ESPN (with the former later moving to Fox Sports).

In May 2019, NFL Network announced a four-year deal with Conference USA to air a weekly regular-season game on Saturday afternoons beginning in the 2019 season. NFL Network opted out of the agreement after one season.

Since 2019, NFL Network has annually carried the Black College Football Hall of Fame Classic, a college football kickoff game that features a matchup of two historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on the Sunday before Labor Day. The HBCU Legacy Bowl, a postseason all-star game involving draft-eligible HBCU players, also has broadcast rights held by NFL Network.

In the 2022 season, NFL Network returned to carrying regular college football games through a weekly sub-license agreement with ESPN.

==== High school football ====
NFL Network aired two high school all-star games in June 2007: the Bayou Bowl between players from Texas and Louisiana on June 9 (via a live feed from regional sports network FSN Southwest), and the Big 33 Football Classic between players from Pennsylvania and Ohio on June 16 (sharing its feed with CN8 (now the Comcast Network) and cable outlets in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Ohio).

For the 2023 off-season, the NFL Network broadcast delayed games from the 7-on-7 Overtime&#x27;s football league (OT7). In 2024 the network had live coverage of OT7&#x27;s five-week regular season.

==== Canadian Football League ====
On July 1, 2010, NFL Network began airing live Canadian Football League games simulcast from Canadian sports network TSN. NFL Network aired the league&#x27;s Thursday games, three Saturday games during the month of July, and then Friday night games beginning in September (after ArenaBowl XXIII). NFL Network did not air CFL games during August as it carried a heavy amount of NFL preseason game broadcasts. In addition, NFL Network did not carry any playoff games, including the Grey Cup championship, as those games are all played on Sundays opposite NFL regular season games. Those games were instead broadcast on the ESPN3 online service (ESPN owns a 20% interest in TSN, in a joint venture with majority parent Bell Media). On May 25, 2012, NFL Network announced it would not renew its contract with the CFL. The package was subsequently acquired by the NBC Sports Network, then by the ESPN networks.

NFL Network expressed interest in picking up CFL games again beginning in the 2019 season after its previous deal with ESPN expired. To accommodate this, the NFL insisted that the CFL move its schedule over a month earlier than it currently runs, so that the network can use the league to fill air time between the NFL draft and training camp. As such a change would require a rework of the league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement, it was unable to fulfill that request and instead renewed its agreement with ESPN.

==== Alliance of American Football ====
On January 31, 2019, NFL Network signed a multi-year deal to air Alliance of American Football games, broadcasting two games per week, most of them on Saturday and Sunday nights. As with all other AAF games, the broadcasts were produced in conjunction with CBS Sports. The league ultimately folded in the middle of its inaugural season.

== High definition ==
NFL Network HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast feed of NFL Network that launched in August 2004. It is available nationally on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network, and regionally on Verizon FiOS, AT&amp;T U-verse and most Comcast and Cogeco Cable systems.

In mid-October 2008, in-studio programs began to air in &quot;enhanced HD&quot;, featuring contained additional scores and statistics on a dedicated wing on the right side of the screen that was only visible on the HD feed. Content that is presented in 4:3 standard definition is shown with stylized pillarboxes, or for some footage, blurred pillarbox wings. On May 1, 2009, &quot;NFL Total Access&quot; began airing in full HD without pillarboxing or enhanced graphics; this was followed by the upgrade of &quot;NFL GameDay&quot; to HD the following September.

Most providers began to exclusively carry the HD feed of the network during 2011, transmitting a downscaled and letterboxed version of the HD feed to provide the channel in 4:3 standard definition for analog viewers without any deviation, including the &quot;NFL HD&quot; logo. The standard definition feed was discontinued entirely in July 2012, concurrent with the introduction of the network&#x27;s current logo.

== NFL RedZone channel ==
The NFL RedZone channel is a special game-day only channel that broadcasts on Sundays during the regular season from 1:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time). &quot;RedZone&quot; provides &quot;whip around&quot; coverage of all Sunday afternoon games airing in-progress on CBS and Fox. Whenever a team enters the red zone, the coverage will switch full-screen over to the live feed of that game&#x27;s television broadcast, and attempt to cover a potential scoring result (touchdown or field goal). The coverage is hosted by Scott Hanson. This is not to be confused with the former DirecTV-exclusive channel which was a part of NFL Sunday Ticket until the end of the 2022 season.

Starting in 2016, NFL Network during the offseason replayed one week of NFL RedZone every Sunday from the previous season.

== International distribution ==
===Canada===
NFL Network was approved for distribution on Canadian television providers by the CRTC in 2004; any NFL Network-exclusive live games are blacked out on the feed distributed in Canada, as those games are aired on Bell Media&#x27;s networks, including TSN and CTV/CTV 2.

NFL Network is also offered as part of DAZN&#x27;s NFL Game Pass service as of 2017.

=== United Kingdom ===
It was reported that the network would be made available in the United Kingdom in 2008. However, this did not come to pass although significant elements of NFL Network programming is now seen in the UK on Sky Sports. Almost every edition of &quot;Good Morning Football&quot; and &quot;NFL Total Access&quot; are broadcast by &quot;Sky Sports NFL&quot;, which Sky has operated throughout the NFL season since 2020, and NFL Red Zone airs in the UK in its entirety on Sky Sports Mix.

=== Germany ===
Since the 2017 season, NFL Network is a part of the IPTV subscription service DAZN, which also offers NFL RedZone to German viewers.

=== Brazil ===
NFL Network is available on NFL GamePass Free Tier. NFL RedZone is available on the Pro Tier.

== Carriage and distribution complications ==
The launch of the &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; package led NFL Network to increasingly insist on carriage on lower subscription tiers of television providers; in particular, demanding carriage on a basic package and a carriage fee of $0.61 per subscriber. Time Warner Cable and other major cable providers wished to place it on a sports tier. Cable companies felt that a channel with such marginal interest, few live games, and filler programming, would be tough to sell outside of the football season. In February 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the NFL had been in discussion with Disney executives over the possibility of partnering with ESPN to bolster NFL Network; one analyst suggested the possibility of NFL Network being combined into its lesser-viewed, but better-carried ESPN Classic channel.

=== 2006 free preview ===
NFL Network offered a free preview from December 24 to 30, 2006 to Suddenlink Communications systems in West Texas, and to Time Warner Cable and Cablevision systems in the New York City area. The package included the Texas Bowl and Insight Bowl, but excluded that week&#x27;s NFL game between the New York Giants and Washington Redskins (which was already scheduled to air on a local broadcast station under existing NFL policy). However, Time Warner Cable and Cablevision were only interested in showing the Texas Bowl, which featured the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, who developed strong local appeal in 2006 and barely missed a berth in the Bowl Championship Series. The NFL denied that request and would only offer the free preview if Cablevision and/or Time Warner Cable made the entire preview week available to customers.

TWC then offered to carry the free preview on a digital tier. Cablevision, however, continued to refuse to carry any NFL Network programming other than the Texas Bowl. It even announced that Cablevision would put it on channel 14 (normally occupied by a television listings channel that was used as an overflow feed for MSG Network and FSN New York) at 6:00 p.m. until the end of the network&#x27;s postgame coverage. The NFL, however, stated that it would not accept that request.

On December 21, however, after New Jersey legislators threatened legal action, Cablevision changed its mind and indeed showed not only the game between Rutgers and Kansas State, but also the entire free preview schedule. Time Warner had made a similar announcement only hours earlier. Suddenlink agreed on December 22 to carry the entire free preview for their customers in West Texas. The free preview did not lead to long-term carriage deals, and the standoff continued between all three cable companies and the NFL Network.

=== 2007 Packers vs. Cowboys controversy ===
2007 saw fresh controversy about the NFL Network. That year, the network happened to hold the rights to some match-ups with major implications. The first came in late November when the one-loss Dallas Cowboys hosted the one-loss Green Bay Packers. Green Bay&#x27;s Brett Favre was also having one of the best seasons of his career and would eventually lead the resurgent Packers to the NFC Championship Game. Most fans could not see the game because of carriage restrictions, more noticeable because it involved nationally respected teams in a highly anticipated match-up. This controversy would pale in comparison to the final game the NFL Network would broadcast that season.

=== 2007 Patriots vs. Giants controversy ===

In December 2007, U.S. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts wrote a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking for the league to settle their differences in time for the New England Patriots-New York Giants game on December 29 that would be broadcast on &quot;Saturday Night Football&quot;. The game was the Patriots&#x27; record-sealing win that made them the first undefeated team through the regular season in 35 years. Kerry urged for a solution to be decided upon in time so that Americans could witness &quot;a historic event&quot;. An agreement was worked out between the NFL and two of the league&#x27;s television partners, NBC and CBS, to allow the NFL Network broadcast of the game to be simulcast on those networks, resulting in the first NFL simulcast since Super Bowl I and the first three-network simulcast in the history of the league.

In addition, New York City area MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV (channel 9), and Hearst Television-owned ABC affiliates WCVB-TV (channel 5) in Boston and WMUR-TV (channel 9) in Manchester, New Hampshire, expressed dissatisfaction over the CBS/NBC simulcast, stating it violated their agreements with the network. The stations had already been scheduled to air the game, as per NFL rules. Greg Aiello, an NFL spokesperson, stated that NBC and CBS would not have agreed to present the simulcast without clearing the game nationally, including the aforementioned markets. WWOR came to an agreement with the network and showed the game along with WNBC and WCBS-TV (channel 2) in the New York City market. WCVB also would still televise the game and stated that it was still working toward resolving issues with the NFL Network over additional coverage rights. The result of these arrangements was that viewers in the New York, Boston and New Hampshire areas could see the game on up to four networks. Also in addition, satellite provider Dish Network and radio companies Sirius XM Radio and Entercom, expressed dissatisfaction over the NBC/CBS simulcast.

RCN Corporation, the 12th-largest cable provider in the U.S., stated that the league&#x27;s deal with CBS and NBC &quot;devalues its contract with the league’s in-house service.&quot; Greg Aiello, an NFL spokesperson, said he was unaware of dissatisfaction among NFL Network affiliates over the simulcast and if any were seeking a rebate or other form of compensation because the game was being more widely distributed. If that were the case, he said, those discussions would “take place privately with our TV partners.”

=== Comcast ===
On November 10, 2006, Comcast announced it would add NFL Network on its digital tier in time for the debut of &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;. On August 6, 2007, Comcast moved NFL Network from the digital tiers to the &quot;Sports Entertainment Package&quot;. This led to a court battle between NFL Network and Comcast, with the ruling in favor of Comcast; the NFL Network later appealed the ruling. Comcast sent NFL Network a cease-and-desist letter to stop encouraging subscribers to drop their Comcast service. Comcast&#x27;s carriage agreement with the NFL Network ended in mid-2009. On February 26, 2008, a New York appellate court reversed course on a May 2007 judgment that allowed Comcast to move the network from its second-most distributed tier to the company&#x27;s sports tier. At that time, a court date had not been set. Four judges at the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled the language &quot;concerning &quot;additional programming package&quot; was ambiguous and that &quot;neither party has established that its interpretation of the relevant contracts is a matter of law.&quot;&quot; Comcast&#x27;s deal with the NFL Network was set to expire on April 30, 2009. According to messages sent out to Comcast, Midco, and some Cable Systems customers with or without set-top boxes, NFL Network might be removed from some customers&#x27; channel lineups. The message said: &quot;In spite of our efforts to continue carrying NFL Network/NFL Network HD, the NFL may terminate our rights. As a result these networks may be removed from lineups as soon as 5/1.&quot; On April 10, 2009, it was confirmed that Comcast would remove the channel on that date due to failing to reach a carriage agreement. However, on April 30, 2009, NFL Network announced that it would continue to be carried on Comcast in the interim while both sides tried to reach an agreemenet on a new contract. On July 30, 2009, NFL Network was made available to lower-tiered Comcast digital cable subscribers.

NFL Network later filed a discrimination case against Comcast with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), claiming that since Comcast does not charge an extra fee for the sports channels it owns, Versus and Golf Channel, it considered Comcast&#x27;s move to charge extra for NFL Network unfair. On October 10, 2008, the FCC ruled as follows:
==== Comcast trial ====
The trial before an administrative law judge (as ordered above) began on April 14, 2009. On April 17, 2009, Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts testified that the provider was willing to move the channel from the Sports Entertainment Package to a lower-priced base package if the subscriber fee was reduced to 25¢ per month (at that time, NFL Network was charging 75¢ per month). He claimed that overall, Comcast saved $50 million a year in license fees by leaving the channel on its Sports Package, which in turn led to savings for its customers.

On April 30, 2009, NFL Network &quot;Total Access&quot; correspondent Lindsey Soto reported Comcast would continue to carry the network after its contract expired at midnight as negotiations proceeded. On May 19, 2009, the NFL and Comcast reached a ten-year agreement to place NFL Network on Comcast&#x27;s Digital Classic package by August 1, 2009, for a monthly price between 45 and 50¢, instead of the 70¢ fee that the NFL originally requested. This deal led to speculation that other cable operators would end their holdouts and try to reach deals that would bring the network to a wider audience. 

, the NFL Network was available only on the Digital Preferred or Sports package on Comcast&#x27;s Xfinity system in Atlanta, Georgia, and not on a Digital Classic package (which does not exist). This is contrary to the above-mentioned agreement between Comcast and the NFL.

=== Time Warner Cable ===
NFL Network was added to Time Warner Cable systems in western New York and the Mohawk Valley in 2005 following the company&#x27;s acquisition of Adelphia Communications&#x27; assets, replacing Adelphia&#x27;s regional sports network, Empire. It was NFL Network&#x27;s first substantial clearance on an analog cable system.

On December 20, 2007, the NFL Network proposed to Time Warner Cable to enter into binding arbitration, which would have a neutral third party determine the price and tier for NFL Network on the provider&#x27;s systems, based on fair market value of the service. The NFL Network noted that the process could take some time and offered to make the December 29, 2007 game between the then unbeaten New England Patriots and New York Giants immediately available to Time Warner Cable subscribers, upon “written agreement to participate in the arbitration process and to be bound by its result.” The network was willing to make the binding arbitration available to cable providers not carrying the NFL Network and for an extension of Comcast&#x27;s current contract.

Time Warner Cable denied the binding arbitration proposal, saying &quot;the operator has successfully reached agreements with hundreds of programming networks without the use of arbitration. We continue to believe that the best way to achieve results is to privately seek a resolution and not attempt to negotiate through the press or elected officials.” TWC stated that it would be willing to make the network available on its sports tier, as a premium service, or make the game available to its subscribers on a per-game basis, at a retail price set by the NFL, with 100% of attendant revenue going to the league. The network refused and stated:
On September 21, 2012, the Associated Press reported that Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks had reached an agreement to carry NFL Network. Within hours, both NFL Network and NFL RedZone began to be carried on many Time Warner Cable systems in time for that week&#x27;s games, with full distribution across the company&#x27;s systems planned to be completed by September 27, in time for the next &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game.

=== Cogeco ===
On November 10, 2006, Canadian cable provider Cogeco Cable announced that it had reached a carriage agreement with the NFL Network to carry the network on its &quot;Sports &amp; Information Tier&quot;. NFL Network had previously insisted that it would only allow cable providers to carry the network on basic tiers; Time Warner Cable stated it would only carry the network on a digital sports tier. This makes Cogeco the only major cable provider to reach an agreement with the NFL Network by placing it directly on a digital sports tier without any repercussions from the network. When it was announced that NFL Network would carry &quot;Run to the Playoffs&quot; on Cogeco but not on a digital basic tier, it was stated that Cogeco&#x27;s &quot;Sports &amp; Information Tier&quot; &quot;has about 30% penetration across all Cogeco subscribers and 60% penetration among Cogeco digital-cable homes.&quot;

=== Insight Communications ===
In 2004, Insight Communications reached a carriage agreement with the NFL Network to carry the network on the provider&#x27;s digital tier, in addition to carrying NFL Network On Demand and NFL Network HD. At first, Insight did not carry the &quot;Run to the Playoffs&quot; games due to the extra surcharge providers pay to carry the games. Insight did not show the first-ever game, between the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs on November 23, 2006, but the game that aired the following week and future games were available due to a long-term agreement that was later reached. Following Insight&#x27;s January 2012 acquisition by Time Warner Cable, TWC chose to let the carriage agreement for NFL Network and NFL RedZone expire on August 1, 2012, which resulted in the two channels being removed from Insight&#x27;s systems in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, due to the long-running carriage impasse between the National Football League and Time Warner Cable. They were restored immediately upon Time Warner reaching a carriage agreement with the network two months later.

=== Dish Network ===
On February 20, 2008, Dish Network moved the NFL Network from its &quot;America&#x27;s Top 100&quot; package to the &quot;America&#x27;s Top 200&quot; package. Dish Network notified customers that the NFL Network was &quot;moving out of Free Preview into America&#x27;s Top 200 package&quot; on February 20, 2008. The move cost NFL Network four million subscribers. On February 27, 2008, the NFL Network announced it would file suit against Dish Network for moving the network to &quot;America&#x27;s Top 200&quot;. The move stemmed from the NFL Network&#x27;s decision to simulcast the 2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game on CBS and NBC, in addition to the game being shown on the NFL Network. , the NFL no longer encouraged customers to switch to Dish Network on the IWantMyNFL.com website; instead, the network only encouraged customers to switch to DirecTV, Verizon FiOS or AT&amp;T U-verse if their provider does not carry the network or has placed the network on a higher-priced tier.

On January 15, 2009, New York State Supreme Court Judge Rich Lowe ruled in favor of NFL Network, claiming their 2006 agreement for carriage on America&#x27;s Top 100 package was still valid and Dish Network violated it by moving it to the America&#x27;s Top 200 package, but he did not order Dish Network to move the channel to the lower package immediately.

On April 10, 2009, it was announced that NFL Network and Dish Network had reached an out-of-court settlement to place the channel on the &quot;Classic Silver 200&quot; package.

On June 16, 2016, Dish entered a new dispute with the NFL Network when the contract to carry the network expired at 7 PM ET, which resulted in the removal of the NFL Network and NFL Red Zone from the Dish Lineup, which marked the first time in the history of the NFL Network that a carriage agreement contract to carry the NFL Network expired and a new agreement was not reached before the deadline in which resulted in the temporary removal of the network from a cable/satellite provider. As part of the new carriage agreement, Dish subsidiary Sling TV added both networks to its lineup on August 11, 2016, in time for the start of the 2016 NFL preseason schedule. NFL Network was available on Sling until June 19, 2020.

=== Charter Communications ===
Charter Communications became one of the first multiple system operators to provide NFL Network, in 2004. Initially the deal called for the network to be carried on Charter&#x27;s digital-basic programming and included NFL HD and NFL On Demand. However, in December 2005, the network had pulled itself from Charter and filed a breach of contract suit against the provider in the New York Supreme Court over contract language regarding distribution. It was reported that NFL Network wanted a 125% rate increase in carriage fees and placement on Charter&#x27;s expanded basic tiers.

In August 2011, Charter Communications and NFL Network announced that the two parties had reached a new, long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network and RedZone in time for the 2011 season.

=== Suddenlink ===
On August 20, 2010, the National Cable Television Cooperative reached an agreement, of which Suddenlink Communications is a member, to carry the NFL Network on the organization&#x27;s participating providers. As a result, Suddenlink announced it would offer NFL Network and NFL RedZone and immediately began carrying the channels. Suddenlink expected that the network&#x27;s rollout to all of its service areas would be completed by or before September 12, the first Sunday of the NFL&#x27;s 2010 regular season.

=== AT&amp;T U-verse ===
On April 15, 2019, AT&amp;T U-verse removed the channel from the lineup along with NFL RedZone.

==Carriage disputes==
===Cablevision===
The network refused to be carried on Cablevision in 2004, but that this dispute ended in 2006, when the network was added to Cablevision.

<doc id="794738" wikidata="Q953557" url="?curid=794738" title="Gros Islet District">
<text>Gros Islet District, one of 10 first order subdivision (districts, formerly quarters) of the Caribbean island nation of Saint Lucia which includes the island&#x27;s northernmost point, Cap Point and the notable Cap Estate, where the renowned St. Lucia Golf and Country Club is located. Whilst the town of Gros Islet is an important administrative centre, Rodney Bay is the main financial center of the district.

==History==

The Arawak and Carib artifacts found in Gros Islet District date back to around 1000 A.D.

The pirate François Le Clerc, nicknamed Jambe de Bois because of his wooden leg, used Pigeon Island as a base to attack Spanish ships in the 1550s. Peg-Leg Le Clerc was originally from Normandy and the first European to settle Saint Lucia.

Because of the good anchorage at Gros Islet harbor, early French and British sailing ships often anchored at this port city. The French established 47 plantations for producing sugar in Gros Islet by 1775. The Marquis de Bouille captured Gros Islet in 1793 before he was forced to retreat by George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney from his base on Pigeon Island.

During World War II, 221 acres of land at Gros Islet were turned into a U.S. Naval Air Station with seaplanes. All that survives today are the cement ramps used by the plane to come on land.

== Government ==

The Gros Islet District is an electoral constituency and has been represented since July 2021 in the House of Assembly of Saint Lucia by Kenson Casimir, Parliamentary Representative for the Gros Islet electoral constituency.

==Modern day events==

The town of Gros Islet lies north of Castries, the capital of Saint Lucia. Gros Islet is the newest town in Saint Lucia, having been promoted from a village to a town in 1985. It is the location of the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium where Twenty20 Internationals, One Day Internationals and Test Cricket are played. Parts of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, 2010 ICC World Twenty20 and 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup have been played there.

The town of Gros Islet features a Friday Night Street Party as its major tourist attraction. Also known as the jump-up, the Friday Night Street Party encompasses several blocks, which are informally cordoned off with the stalls of street vendors. Steamed fish, barbecue chicken and St. Lucia&#x27;s own Piton beer can be purchased from these vendors. Locals and tourist both dance in a central cross section in the small streets to the sounds of calypso, zouk, reggae and R&amp;B.

The Rodney Bay area further south differs greatly from the small, makeshift housing littering most of the town of Gros Islet. Catering mostly to the tourism populace, the areas surrounding the marina contain shops, malls, restaurants and night clubs that fall on the higher end of the spectrum compared to other local enterprises. Land development costs in Rodney Bay are extremely high. The exclusive beach front properties have almost all been purchased by small and large hoteliers, and restaurateurs, frustrating locals who continually see access to the public beaches being blocked by large construction projects.

The historic Pigeon Island is a popular place for tourists because of it peacefulness and wildlife. A man-made causeway connects it to the mainland.

<text>Frederick Campion &quot;Camp&quot; Steward FRS (16 June 1904 – 13 September 1993) was a British botanist and plant physiologist.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Pimlico, London, but brought up in Yorkshire. He was educated at Heckmondwike Grammar School and then attended the University of Leeds, where he gained a BSc in biology in 1924 and then undertook research in the botany department.

== Career ==
A Rockefeller Foundation fellowship took him first to Cornell University in 1924 and then to the University of California at Berkeley four years later, where he worked as postdoctoral researcher with Dennis Robert Hoagland from 1928 to 1929. In 1934 he returned to England as a reader in botany and from 1940 to serve in the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After the war he returned to the USA, holding appointments at the Universities of Chicago and Rochester before finally moving to Cornell in 1950.

 Professor F.C. Steward discovered and laid the foundation for plant tissue culture; genetic engineering and plant biotechnology, whether of food crops or trees.

His most important scientific contribution came in 1958, when he established that plants could be totally regenerated from one cell. The finding revolutionised the world of plant cell biology, establishing for the first time that plant cuttings and shoots were no longer required to propagate hybrids and create mutations but that individual plant cells contained all the necessary information to regulate the entire plant organism. His discovery of the means to obtain such regeneration has formed the basis of the entire field of plant molecular biology, meaning that clones, hybrids and mutations of plants can be accomplished in the laboratory rather than having to resort to the far longer and cumbersome process of taking and then cultivating cuttings.

From his Cornell classrooms and laboratories, Steward was responsible for creating and inspiring a generation of botanists. Former students said that his lectures, in &quot;advanced plant physiology&quot; were the high point of their education. The lectures covered an entire year, he used no notes, and would speak as he walked back and forth in front of the lecture theatre in Plant Science hall. From the outset of his career, Steward was often associated with scientific controversy and he often tended to be at its epicentre. He believed that one could be and maybe should be a &quot;majority of one&quot; if scientific convictions dictated it.

== Recognition ==

Steward was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1957. His candidature citation read:

:&quot;[Steward] has contributed to knowledge of salt absorption, accumulation and transport since 1930. His earlier work established that ion accumulation was linked to metabolism at a time when this was doubted, and in this connection extensive studies of protein metabolism were undertaken. Steward and his colleagues Dent and Stepka made important early studies using the (then) new technique of chromatographic separation of amino acids. He has (following a distinguished war record as Director of Aircraft Equipment II) been successful in recent years in isolating from coconut milk the factors which promote or maintain plant cells in the embryonic or meristematic condition. Two have been identified definitely as diphenylures and a leuco-anthocyanin. His current studies are dealing with mode of action of these substances and with ion accumulation processes of meristem tissue&quot;.

Steward delivered The Royal Society&#x27;s Croonian Lecture in 1969 on &quot;From cultured cells to whole plants: the induction and control of their growth and morphogenesis&quot;.

He wrote more than 100 scientific journal articles and several books and was an editor and contributor to the 10 volumes and 15 books of &quot;Plant Physiology: A Treatise&quot; (Academic Press, 1959–1991).

== Family life ==

He died in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He had married Anne Temple Gordon, whom he met at Cornell. They had one son.

<doc id="794761" wikidata="Q7638154" url="?curid=794761" title="SunPass">
<text>SunPass is an electronic toll collection system within the state of Florida, United States. It was created in 1999 by the Florida Department of Transportation&#x27;s (FDOT&#x27;s) Office of Toll Operations, operating now as a division of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE). The system utilizes windshield-mounted RFID transponders manufactured by TransCore and lane equipment designed by companies including TransCore, SAIC, and Raytheon.

== History ==
SunPass was introduced on April 24, 1999, and by October 1 of the same year, more than 100,000 SunPass transponders had been sold.

In early 2009, all Easy Pay customers automatically became SunPass Plus customers if they opt-in and have the privilege of using their transponders to pay for airport parking at Tampa, Orlando, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Miami airports. Customers can opt out of the SunPass Plus program.

== Functionality ==
The Mini was introduced on July 1, 2008, and became available at retail locations. The Mini is a RFID passive transponder, about the size of a credit card, and requires no batteries. The transponder must be mounted on the glass windshield of the vehicle to work properly and, once applied, cannot be removed from a windshield without destroying the pass. The SunPass Mini sticker will not work on motorcycle windshields as they are not made of glass.

SunPass Portable (or SunPass Pro) transponders can be transferred between vehicles. The Sunpass Pro portable transporter offers E-ZPass interoperability, unlike the Mini. Customers must establish an opening account of at least $10 to fund their tolls. Unused toll fees are only refunded if the user closes the account or takes advantage of a money-back guarantee.

===Technology===

SunPass-only toll lanes on most toll roads in Florida allow a vehicle to proceed through the tollbooth at speeds of up to as a safety precaution. The Turnpike utilizes all-electronic tolling (AET) and toll by plate which handles highway speeds. The mainline toll barriers have dedicated lanes capable of full-speed automatic toll collection at up to .

Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise converted the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, the Sawgrass Expressway, and the Veterans Expressway to open road tolling, utilizing the SunPass transponders, in September 2010, February 2011, April 2014, and June 2014 respectively, ceasing cash collection. This allows free-flowing movement on both toll roads, moving through toll gantries at the former toll plazas. Motorists without a SunPass are billed through toll by plate. Toll-by-Plate uses cameras and sends a bill to the registered owner of the vehicle. The bill consists of the toll and an administrative fee. If the person fails to pay the toll and accompanying fees at all, the person would be fined $100 plus the tolls owed; in some cases, court costs, points against the driver&#x27;s license, and the suspension of the license and registration would also be levied.

== Interoperability ==

SunPass is fully interoperable with E-Pass (from the Central Florida Expressway Authority), O-Pass (from Osceola County, which has been folded into E-Pass), LeeWay (from Lee County toll bridges) and the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority (MDX) toll roads.

SunPass, like other electronic toll collection (ETC) systems in Florida, was not initially compatible with systems outside of Florida. The federal MAP-21 transportation bill passed in July 2012 required all toll facilities to have interoperable road tolling systems by October 1, 2016, but it was not met. SunPass announced in 2012 for plans to eventually become interoperable with E-ZPass. As a step towards this, the older battery-powered SunPass transponders were phased out by the end of 2015; new batteryless models can work with tolling equipment in other states.

On July 29, 2013, Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise made an interoperability agreement with North Carolina Turnpike Authority and its NC Quick Pass, allowing SunPass holders to utilize North Carolina&#x27;s toll roads and lanes.

On November 12, 2014, an interoperability agreement was made with Georgia&#x27;s Peach Pass, allowing SunPass holders to utilize the I-85 Express lanes and any future toll roads or lanes in the state. 

The C-Pass system operated by Miami-Dade County Public Works on the Rickenbacker and Venetian Causeways was replaced by SunPass and pay-by-plate on September 23, 2014.

In July 2020, E-ZPass announced that SunPass would be compatible with E-ZPass by the end of that year, along with Peach Pass in 2021. On May 28, 2021, the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise announced that its SunPass facilities would begin accepting E-ZPass. In addition, E-ZPass facilities began accepting SunPass Pro transponders (but not earlier SunPass transponders such as the SunPass Portable and SunPass Mini).

On February 27, 2023, it was announced that SunPass was now compatible with the toll roads in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as on certain toll roads in Texas. Both the SunPass Mini and SunPass Pro transponders are supported. Certain transponders from these three states can be used on all roads maintained by the Florida Turnpike Enterprise. But Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas transponders currently cannot be used on any roads or portions of roads maintained by the Central Florida Expressway Authority.

<doc id="794811" wikidata="Q206215" url="?curid=794811" title="Shigefumi Mori">
<text>is a Japanese mathematician, known for his work in algebraic geometry, particularly in relation to the classification of three-folds. He won the Fields Medal in 1990.

==Career==
Mori completed his Ph.D. titled &quot;The Endomorphism Rings of Some Abelian Varieties&quot; under Masayoshi Nagata at Kyoto University in 1978. He was a visiting professor at Harvard University during 1977–1980, the Institute for Advanced Study in 1981–82, Columbia University 1985–87 and the University of Utah for periods during 1987–89 and again during 1991–92. He has been a professor at Kyoto University since 1990.

==Work==

He generalized the classical approach to the classification of algebraic surfaces to the classification of algebraic three-folds. The classical approach used the concept of minimal models of algebraic surfaces. He found that the concept of minimal models can be applied to three-folds as well if we allow some singularities on them. The extension of Mori&#x27;s results to dimensions higher than three is called the minimal model program and is an active area of research in algebraic geometry.

He has been elected president of the International Mathematical Union, becoming the first head of the group from East Asia.

==Awards==
He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990 at the International Congress of Mathematicians.

In 2021, he received the Order of Culture.

<doc id="794832" wikidata="Q3516190" url="?curid=794832" title="Moog Taurus">
<text>The Moog Taurus is a foot-operated analog synthesizer designed and manufactured by Moog Music. It was originally conceived as a part of the Constellation series of synthesizers. The initial Taurus I was manufactured from 1975 to 1981; a less popular redesign, Taurus II, followed from 1981 to 1983. Instead of a conventional keyboard, the Taurus uses an organ-style pedal board similar to the pedal keyboard of a spinet organ. This control method was chosen because the Taurus was intended to be played by foot while the player&#x27;s hands played one or more keyboards, although it was often used by guitarists. While the original Taurus featured its own synthesis engine, the Taurus II was essentially the same as the Moog Rogue. In 2010, Moog issued the Moog Taurus III which closely emulates the analog circuitry of the Taurus I, in addition to adding some modern features.

The Taurus is mostly associated with progressive rock, and has been used by bands like Genesis, Yes, Rush, and Dream Theater, among others.

== History ==
The Taurus was originally intended to be part of a larger Moog Music synthesizer ensemble called the Constellation. In addition to the monophonic Taurus, the Constellation would have included two keyboards: the monophonic Lyra and polyphonic Apollo. The intention was that the Apollo and Lyra be played with both hands, while bass notes could be played by foot on the Taurus. The sound shaping controls are protected by a removable plastic window in order to avoid accidental adjustments while playing. The Constellation configuration was used prominently on the 1973 Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;. The band also used the Constellation on their subsequent tour, albeit without the Taurus pedal. However, the Constellation was never formally released. Instead, the Apollo synthesizer, designed by Moog&#x27;s Director of Engineering, David Luce, was redesigned and greatly upgraded to the Moog Polymoog, which was produced from 1975 to 1980; the Taurus I pedal, also designed by Luce, was released as a separate unit from 1975 to 1981. The Lyra synthesizer, designed by Robert Moog, was never commercially released. William Alexander, an engineer for ELP, described the Lyra as &quot;a Minimoog on steroids&quot;.

=== Taurus II ===

The original Taurus I was succeeded by the Taurus II, which was produced from 1981 to 1983. The Taurus II uses the same synthesis engine as a contemporary lead synthesizer, the Moog Rogue. The Taurus II was controlled through 18 foot pedals, modulation and pitch bend wheels, and a CV interface. The synthesizer also increased the amount of timbres and effects available. However, the Taurus II had no patch memory or foot controls apart from the pedals. Instead, the control panel was raised so that the player could manipulate it manually during performance.

The value of the Taurus II did not appreciate as significantly as that of the Taurus I; in 2000, Mark Vail noted that the Taurus II was worth only about half as much as its predecessor. In general, the Taurus II is considered to be inferior to the original model because of its different synthesis engine.

===Taurus III===
In 2010, Moog released a redesigned version of the Taurus called the Taurus III in a limited run of 1,000 units. According to Moog&#x27;s creative head Cyril Lance, a reissue of the Taurus had been in high demand since his first convention with Moog, the 2006 NAMM Show, shortly after Robert Moog&#x27;s death. In 2007, Moog CEO Mike Adams proposed that if customers could generate pre-order sales of 250 units, the Taurus would go into production. Work on designing the Taurus III, led by Lance, began that year after 250 units were pre-ordered. Production ceased in June 2012.

The Taurus III overlooks many of the changes made for the Taurus II, instead more closely emulating the original model. For instance, there is only one waveform available for the unit&#x27;s two oscillators. Some features are added, such as USB and MIDI support, a larger memory capacity, and velocity sensitivity. The Taurus III also adds an arpeggiator and an LFO.

==Synthesis model==
The Taurus is monophonic, with its single voice generated by two oscillators running through one three-stage voltage-controlled amplifier. For the Taurus I and Taurus III, only one waveform was available: a distorted sawtooth wave. The Taurus II introduced a second waveform, the pulse wave. All models of the Taurus use a 24db/octave resonant low pass filter with key tracking. Although the early models did not include an LFO, the Taurus III has an LFO that can be routed to either oscillator pitch or filter frequency.

== Notable users ==
The Taurus is well known for its use by progressive rock bands, such as Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, Rush, Yes and Genesis. Harmonium&#x27;s bass guitarist, Louis Valois, used the Moog Taurus I during the band&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;heptade&quot; tour in 1976-1977, which can be heard in the live recording of one of these shows, &quot;Harmonium en tournée.&quot; Other bands such as U2 and The Police have also used the synthesizer. John Hackett was known for playing the foot pedals of a Taurus with one hand, while using the other hand to change the octave range. 
Starcastle bassist Gary Strater was known for using two sets on stage. Phil Collins introduced the distinctive Taurus sound to top 40 radio with his hit &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Anymore&quot;.

According to Moog Music, artists that purchased the Taurus III also included The Black Keys, Todd Tamanend Clark, Animal Collective, Jean Michel Jarre, Steely Dan, Weezer, Dream Theater, Umphrey&#x27;s Mcgee, and Dave Matthews Band.

<doc id="794841" wikidata="Q2719417" url="?curid=794841" title="Canonical normal form">
<text>In Boolean algebra, any Boolean function can be expressed in the canonical disjunctive normal form ([[Disjunctive normal form|CDNF]]), minterm canonical form, or Sum of Products (SoP or SOP) as a disjunction (OR) of minterms. The De Morgan dual is the canonical conjunctive normal form ([[Conjunctive normal form|CCNF]]), maxterm canonical form, or Product of Sums (PoS or POS) which is a conjunction (AND) of maxterms. These forms can be useful for the simplification of Boolean functions, which is of great importance in the optimization of Boolean formulas in general and digital circuits in particular.

Other canonical forms include the complete sum of prime implicants or Blake canonical form (and its dual), and the algebraic normal form (also called Zhegalkin or Reed–Muller).

==Minterms ==
For a boolean function of formula_1 variables formula_2, a minterm is a product term in which each of the formula_1 variables appears &quot;exactly once&quot; (either in its complemented or uncomplemented form). Thus, a &quot;minterm&quot; is a logical expression of &quot;n&quot; variables that employs only the complement operator and the conjunction operator (logical AND). A minterm gives a true value for just one combination of the input variables, the minimum nontrivial amount. For example, &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;&#x27; &quot;c&quot;, is true only when &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; both are true and &quot;b&quot; is false—the input arrangement where &quot;a&quot; = 1, &quot;b&quot; = 0, &quot;c&quot; = 1 results in 1.

=== Indexing minterms ===
There are 2&quot;n&quot; minterms of &quot;n&quot; variables, since a variable in the minterm expression can be in either its direct or its complemented form—two choices per variable. Minterms are often numbered by a binary encoding of the complementation pattern of the variables, where the variables are written in a standard order, usually alphabetical. This convention assigns the value 1 to the direct form (formula_4) and 0 to the complemented form (formula_5); the minterm is then formula_6. For example, minterm formula_7 is numbered 1102 = 610 and denoted formula_8.

===Minterm canonical form===

Given the truth table of a logical function, it is possible to write the function as a &quot;sum of products&quot; or &quot;sum of minterms&quot;. This is a special form of disjunctive normal form. For example, if given the truth table for the arithmetic sum bit &quot;u&quot; of one bit position&#x27;s logic of an adder circuit, as a function of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; from the addends and the carry in, &quot;ci&quot;:

Observing that the rows that have an output of 1 are the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 8th, we can write &quot;u&quot; as a sum of minterms formula_9 and formula_10. If we wish to verify this: formula_11 evaluated for all 8 combinations of the three variables will match the table.

== Maxterms ==
For a boolean function of variables formula_2, a maxterm is a sum term in which each of the variables appears &quot;exactly once&quot; (either in its complemented or uncomplemented form). Thus, a &quot;maxterm&quot; is a logical expression of variables that employs only the complement operator and the disjunction operator (logical OR). Maxterms are a dual of the minterm idea, following the complementary symmetry of De Morgan&#x27;s laws. Instead of using ANDs and complements, we use ORs and complements and proceed similarly. It is apparent that a maxterm gives a &quot;false&quot; value for just one combination of the input variables, i.e. it is true at the maximal number of possibilities. For example, the maxterm &quot;a&quot;′ + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;′ is false only when &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; both are true and &quot;b&quot; is false—the input arrangement where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 results in 0.

=== Indexing maxterms ===
There are again 2&quot;n&quot; maxterms of variables, since a variable in the maxterm expression can also be in either its direct or its complemented form—two choices per variable. The numbering is chosen so that the complement of a minterm is the respective maxterm. That is, each maxterm is assigned an index based on the opposite conventional binary encoding used for minterms. The maxterm convention assigns the value 0 to the direct form formula_13 and 1 to the complemented form formula_14. For example, we assign the index 6 to the maxterm formula_15 (110) and denote that maxterm as &quot;M&quot;6. The complement formula_16 is the minterm formula_17, using de Morgan&#x27;s law.

===Maxterm canonical form===
If one is given a truth table of a logical function, it is possible to write the function as a &quot;product of sums&quot; or &quot;product of maxterms&quot;. This is a special form of conjunctive normal form. For example, if given the truth table for the carry-out bit &quot;co&quot; of one bit position&#x27;s logic of an adder circuit, as a function of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; from the addends and the carry in, &quot;ci&quot;:

Observing that the rows that have an output of 0 are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, we can write &quot;co&quot; as a product of maxterms formula_18 and formula_19. If we wish to verify this:
:formula_20
evaluated for all 8 combinations of the three variables will match the table.

==Minimal PoS and SoP forms==
It is often the case that the canonical minterm form is equivalent to a smaller SoP form. This smaller form would still consist of a sum of product terms, but have fewer product terms and/or product terms that contain fewer variables. For example, the following 3-variable function:

has the canonical minterm representation formula_21, but it has an equivalent SoP form formula_22. In this trivial example, it is obvious that formula_23, and the smaller form has both fewer product terms and fewer variables within each term. The minimal SoP representations of a function according to this notion of &quot;smallest&quot; are referred to as &quot;minimal SoP forms&quot;. In general, there may be multiple minimal SoP forms, none clearly smaller or larger than another. In a similar manner, a canonical maxterm form can be reduced to various minimal PoS forms.

While this example was simplified by applying normal algebraic methods [formula_24], in less obvious cases a convenient method for finding minimal PoS/SoP forms of a function with up to four variables is using a Karnaugh map. The Quine–McCluskey algorithm can solve slightly larger problems. The field of logic optimization developed from the problem of finding optimal implementations of Boolean functions, such as minimal PoS and SoP forms.

==Application example==
The sample truth tables for minterms and maxterms above are sufficient to establish the canonical form for a single bit position in the addition of binary numbers, but are not sufficient to design the digital logic unless your inventory of gates includes AND and OR. Where performance is an issue (as in the Apollo Guidance Computer), the available parts are more likely to be NAND and NOR because of the complementing action inherent in transistor logic. The values are defined as voltage states, one near ground and one near the DC supply voltage Vcc, e.g. +5 VDC. If the higher voltage is defined as the 1 &quot;true&quot; value, a NOR gate is the simplest possible useful logical element.

Specifically, a 3-input NOR gate may consist of 3 bipolar junction transistors with their emitters all grounded, their collectors tied together and linked to Vcc through a load impedance. Each base is connected to an input signal, and the common collector point presents the output signal. Any input that is a 1 (high voltage) to its base shorts its transistor&#x27;s emitter to its collector, causing current to flow through the load impedance, which brings the collector voltage (the output) very near to ground. That result is independent of the other inputs. Only when all 3 input signals are 0 (low voltage) do the emitter-collector impedances of all 3 transistors remain very high. Then very little current flows, and the voltage-divider effect with the load impedance imposes on the collector point a high voltage very near to Vcc.

The complementing property of these gate circuits may seem like a drawback when trying to implement a function in canonical form, but there is a compensating bonus: such a gate with only one input implements the complementing function, which is required frequently in digital logic.

This example assumes the Apollo parts inventory: 3-input NOR gates only, but the discussion is simplified by supposing that 4-input NOR gates are also available (in Apollo, those were compounded out of pairs of 3-input NORs).

===Canonical and non-canonical consequences of NOR gates===
A set of 8 NOR gates, if their inputs are all combinations of the direct and complement forms of the 3 input variables &quot;ci, x,&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, always produce minterms, never maxterms—that is, of the 8 gates required to process all combinations of 3 input variables, only one has the output value 1. That&#x27;s because a NOR gate, despite its name, could better be viewed (using De Morgan&#x27;s law) as the AND of the complements of its input signals.

The reason this is not a problem is the duality of minterms and maxterms, i.e. each maxterm is the complement of the like-indexed minterm, and vice versa.

In the minterm example above, we wrote formula_25 but to perform this with a 4-input NOR gate we need to restate it as a product of sums (PoS), where the sums are the opposite maxterms. That is,

:formula_26

In the maxterm example above, we wrote formula_27 but to perform this with a 4-input NOR gate we need to notice the equality to the NOR of the same minterms. That is,

:formula_28

===Design trade-offs considered in addition to canonical forms===
One might suppose that the work of designing an adder stage is now complete, but we haven&#x27;t addressed the fact that all 3 of the input variables have to appear in both their direct and complement forms. There&#x27;s no difficulty about the addends &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in this respect, because they are static throughout the addition and thus are normally held in latch circuits that routinely have both direct and complement outputs. (The simplest latch circuit made of NOR gates is a pair of gates cross-coupled to make a flip-flop: the output of each is wired as one of the inputs to the other.) There is also no need to create the complement form of the sum &quot;u&quot;. However, the carry out of one bit position must be passed as the carry into the next bit position in both direct and complement forms. The most straightforward way to do this is to pass &quot;co&quot; through a 1-input NOR gate and label the output &quot;co&quot;′, but that would add a gate delay in the worst possible place, slowing down the rippling of carries from right to left. An additional 4-input NOR gate building the canonical form of &quot;co&quot;′ (out of the opposite minterms as &quot;co&quot;) solves this problem.

: formula_29

The trade-off to maintain full speed in this way includes an unexpected cost (in addition to having to use a bigger gate). If we&#x27;d just used that 1-input gate to complement &quot;co&quot;, there would have been no use for the minterm formula_10, and the gate that generated it could have been eliminated. Nevertheless, it is still a good trade.

Now we could have implemented those functions exactly according to their SoP and PoS canonical forms, by turning NOR gates into the functions specified. A NOR gate is made into an OR gate by passing its output through a 1-input NOR gate; and it is made into an AND gate by passing each of its inputs through a 1-input NOR gate. However, this approach not only increases the number of gates used, but also doubles the number of gate delays processing the signals, cutting the processing speed in half. Consequently, whenever performance is vital, going beyond canonical forms and doing the Boolean algebra to make the unenhanced NOR gates do the job is well worthwhile.

===Top-down vs. bottom-up design===
We have now seen how the minterm/maxterm tools can be used to design an adder stage in canonical form with the addition of some Boolean algebra, costing just 2 gate delays for each of the outputs. That&#x27;s the &quot;top-down&quot; way to design the digital circuit for this function, but is it the best way? The discussion has focused on identifying &quot;fastest&quot; as &quot;best,&quot; and the augmented canonical form meets that criterion flawlessly, but sometimes other factors predominate. The designer may have a primary goal of minimizing the number of gates, and/or of minimizing the fanouts of signals to other gates since big fanouts reduce resilience to a degraded power supply or other environmental factors. In such a case, a designer may develop the canonical-form design as a baseline, then try a bottom-up development, and finally compare the results.

The bottom-up development involves noticing that &quot;u = ci&quot; XOR (&quot;x&quot; XOR &quot;y&quot;), where XOR means eXclusive OR [true when either input is true but not when both are true], and that &quot;co&quot; = &quot;ci x&quot; + &quot;x y&quot; + &quot;y ci&quot;. One such development takes twelve NOR gates in all: six 2-input gates and two 1-input gates to produce &quot;u&quot; in 5 gate delays, plus three 2-input gates and one 3-input gate to produce &quot;co&quot;′ in 2 gate delays. The canonical baseline took eight 3-input NOR gates plus three 4-input NOR gates to produce &quot;u, co&quot; and &quot;co&quot;′ in 2 gate delays. If the circuit inventory actually includes 4-input NOR gates, the top-down canonical design looks like a winner in both gate count and speed. But if (contrary to our convenient supposition) the circuits are actually 3-input NOR gates, of which two are required for each 4-input NOR function, then the canonical design takes 14 gates compared to 12 for the bottom-up approach, but still produces the sum digit &quot;u&quot; considerably faster. The fanout comparison is tabulated as:

The description of the bottom-up development mentions &quot;co&quot;′ as an output but not &quot;co&quot;. Does that design simply never need the direct form of the carry out? Well, yes and no. At each stage, the calculation of &quot;co&quot;′ depends only on &quot;ci&quot;′, &quot;x&quot;′ and &quot;y&quot;′, which means that the carry propagation ripples along the bit positions just as fast as in the canonical design without ever developing &quot;co&quot;. The calculation of &quot;u&quot;, which does require &quot;ci&quot; to be made from &quot;ci&quot;′ by a 1-input NOR, is slower but for any word length the design only pays that penalty once (when the leftmost sum digit is developed). That&#x27;s because those calculations overlap, each in what amounts to its own little pipeline without affecting when the next bit position&#x27;s sum bit can be calculated. And, to be sure, the &quot;co&quot;′ out of the leftmost bit position will probably have to be complemented as part of the logic determining whether the addition overflowed. But using 3-input NOR gates, the bottom-up design is very nearly as fast for doing parallel addition on a non-trivial word length, cuts down on the gate count, and uses lower fanouts ... so it wins if gate count and/or fanout are paramount!

We&#x27;ll leave the exact circuitry of the bottom-up design of which all these statements are true as an exercise for the interested reader, assisted by one more algebraic formula: &quot;u&quot; = &quot;ci&quot;(&quot;x&quot; XOR &quot;y&quot;) + &quot;ci&quot;′(&quot;x&quot; XOR &quot;y&quot;)′]′. Decoupling the carry propagation from the sum formation in this way is what elevates the performance of a &quot;carry-lookahead adder&quot; over that of a &quot;ripple carry adder&quot;.

==Application in digital circuit design==
One application of Boolean algebra is digital circuit design, with one goal to minimize the number of gates and another to minimize the settling time.

There are sixteen possible functions of two variables, but in digital logic hardware, the simplest gate circuits implement only four of them: &quot;conjunction&quot; (AND), &quot;disjunction&quot; (inclusive OR), and the respective complements of those (NAND and NOR).

Most gate circuits accept more than 2 input variables; for example, the spaceborne Apollo Guidance Computer, which pioneered the application of integrated circuits in the 1960s, was built with only one type of gate, a 3-input NOR, whose output is true only when all 3 inputs are false.

<text>An acidic oxide is an oxide that either produces an acidic solution upon addition to water, or acts as an acceptor of hydroxide ions effectively functioning as a Lewis acid. Acidic oxides will typically have a low pKa and may be inorganic or organic. A commonly encountered acidic oxide, carbon dioxide produces an acidic solution (and the generation of carbonic acid) when dissolved. Generally non-metallic oxides are acidic.

The acidity of an oxide can be reasonably assumed by its accompanying constituents. Less electronegative elements tend to form basic oxides such as sodium oxide and magnesium oxide, whereas more electronegative elements tend to produce acidic oxides as seen with carbon dioxide and phosphorus pentoxide. Some oxides like aluminium oxides are amphoteric while some oxides may be basic.
Acidic oxides are of environmental concern. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are considered air pollutants as they react with atmospheric water vapour to produce acid rain.

== Examples ==

Carbonic acid is an illustrative example of the Lewis acidity of an acidic oxide.
:CO2 + 2OH− HCO3− + OH− CO32− + H2O
This property is a key reason for keeping alkali chemicals well sealed from the atmosphere, as long-term exposure to carbon dioxide in the air can degrade the material. 

*Carbon dioxide is also the anhydride of carbonic acid:
*Chromium trioxide, which reacts with water forming chromic acid:
*Dinitrogen pentoxide, which reacts with water forming nitric acid:
*Manganese heptoxide, which reacts with water forming permanganic acid:

==Further examples==
===Aluminium oxide===
Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is an amphoteric oxide; it can act as a base or acid. For example, with base different aluminate salts will be formed:
:Al2O3 + 2 NaOH + 3 H2O → 2 NaAl(OH)4

===Silicon dioxide===
Silicon dioxide is an acidic oxide. It will react with strong bases to form silicate salts.

Silicon dioxide is the anhydride of silicic acid: 

===Phosphorus oxides===
Phosphorus(III) oxide reacts to form phosphorous acid in water:
:P4O6 + 6 H2O → 4 H3PO3

Phosphorus(V) oxide reacts with water to give phosphoric acid:
:P4O10 + 6 H2O → 4 H3PO4

===Sulfur oxides===
Sulfur dioxide reacts with water to form the weak acid, sulfurous acid:
:SO2 + H2O → H2SO3

Sulfur trioxide forms the strong acid sulfuric acid with water:
:SO3 + H2O → H2SO4
This reaction is important in the manufacturing of sulfuric acid.

===Chlorine oxides===
Chlorine(I) oxide reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid, a very weak acid:
Chlorine(VII) oxide reacts with water to form perchloric acid, a strong acid:
:Cl2O7 + H2O → 2 HClO4

===Iron oxides===
Iron(II) oxide is the anhydride of the aqueous ferrous ion:

===Chromium oxides===
Chromium trioxide is the anhydride of chromic acid:

===Vanadium oxides===
Vanadium trioxide is the anhydride of vanadous acid:
Vanadium pentoxide is the anhydride of vanadic acid:

<text>Zoran Krušvar is a Croatian psychologist and science fiction and fantasy writer, born on April 9, 1977, in Rijeka. He won 4 SFERA awards, in 2002 (for &quot;Igra&quot;), in 2003 (for &quot;Brodovi u tami&quot;), in 2007 (for &quot;Izvršitelji nauma Gospodnjeg&quot;) and in 2008 (for &quot;Tako biti mora&quot;) from the Zagreb-based science fiction society SFera.

Krušvar&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Izvršitelji nauma Gospodnjeg&quot;, was a multimedia project, first of such kind in Croatia. DVD distributed with the book contains music video soundtrack to the novel, and the trailer for the book was released on YouTube a month before its publishing. At the presentation of the novel on April 22, 2007, a group of young people acted out a ritual sacrifice of a young maiden in order to propitiate God, so the novel would sell better.

<text>The Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (British English) or the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Score (American English) or simply PGCS is the equivalent of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) used to assess the level of consciousness of child patients. As many of the assessments for an adult patient would not be appropriate for infants, the Glasgow Coma Scale was modified slightly to form the PGCS. As with the GCS, the PGCS comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible PGCS (the sum) is 3 (deep coma or death) whilst the highest is 15 (fully awake and aware person). The pediatric GCS is commonly used in emergency medical services.

In patients who are intubated, unconscious, or preverbal, the motor response is considered the most important component of the scale.
==Coma scale==

Any combined score of less than eight represents a significant risk of mortality. A score of 12 or below indicates a severe head injury. A score of less than 8 indicates that intubation and ventilation may be necessary. A score of 6 or below indicates that intracranial pressure monitoring may be necessary.

<text>Katharine Brush (August 15, 1902 – June 10, 1952) was an American newspaper columnist, short-story writer, and novelist. In the era of the 1920s-1930s, she was considered one of the country&#x27;s most widely-read fiction writers, as well as one of the highest paid women writers of her time; several of her books were best-sellers, and several others were made into movies.

==Early years==
Katharine Brush was born Katharine Louise Ingham in Middletown, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Charles S. Ingham, an educator, and his wife Clara. Young Katharine did not attend college; directly after graduating from Centenary Collegiate Institute, a New Jersey boarding school, at age 16, she began working as a movie columnist for the &quot;Boston Evening Traveller.&quot; She married Thomas Stewart Brush when she was eighteen; he was the son of Louis H. Brush of Brush-Moore Newspapers. After the marriage, she moved to Ohio with him.

==Literary career==
Brush&#x27;s writing first attracted attention in the 1920s. During this time, multiple short stories of hers were published in serial magazines like &quot;College Humor&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;; the best known of these were collected in a book titled &quot;Night Club&quot; (1929); the title story first appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in September 1927.

Brush&#x27;s works were characterized by her narrative style and wit: she was praised for being a keen observer of contemporary American life, a writer skilled at presenting the foibles of relationships in a realistic manner. Her story &quot;Him and Her&quot; (published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; March 16, 1929) was an O. Henry Award winner named &quot;Best Short Short&quot; of 1929, and in 1932, she was again named a Best Short Story writer, by the O. Henry Memorial Committee. She also received honorable mentions for her short story &quot;Night Club&quot; (1927); her 1931 story &quot;Good Wednesday&quot;, which also appeared in Harper&#x27;s; as well as for a 1932 short story, &quot;Football Girl&quot;, which was published in &quot;College Humor&quot; in October 1931.

During the mid-1920s, in addition to writing short stories and beginning a novel, she also wrote syndicated columns. Among her columns in the early-to-mid-1920s were occasional articles about sports, including boxing, and college football. And during 1925 and 1926, she covered the World Series for several newspapers in Ohio.

Brush&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Glitter&quot;, was published in 1926, to favorable reviews. Her novel &quot;Young Man of Manhattan&quot; was named the 9th best-selling novel of 1930 by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and later that year was made into a film starring Claudette Colbert, Norman Foster, and Ginger Rogers. Her subsequent novel &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; was made into a film in 1932 starring Jean Harlow; playwright Anita Loos adapted the story for the screen.

In 1936, Katharine Brush christened the USCGC Ingham; the new cutter was formally commissioned on 12 September 1936; it would later be decommissioned in 1988. The ship was named after one of her ancestors, American politician Samuel D. Ingham, and this incident was discussed in her 1940 autobiographical collection of works, &quot;This Is On Me&quot;. It also featured a story about what in the 1970s became known as latchkey children) . Critics praised the book for its honesty in showing the development of Brush&#x27;s talent, by including some early works that were not as impressive, and then moving on to her well-received later works. In addition, the book was said to offer a behind-the-scenes look at how Brush went from obscurity to success as an author. Ironically, Brush (whose nickname was &quot;Kay&quot;) frequently told friends that despite being popular and critically acclaimed, she worried that after she died, she would probably be forgotten. In 1967, only 15 years after her death, a critic who had known her noted that in fact, fewer and fewer people remembered who she was.

==Later years and legacy==
Her first marriage ended in divorce; she moved to New York City and remarried in 1929, to businessman Hubert Charles &quot;Bobby&quot; Winans, but that marriage ended in divorce in 1941. She was the mother of one child, Thomas, with her first husband. She died after a long illness, in New York: some sources say she was 49, but some sources say she was 52. At the time when she took ill, she had been working on a new novel, to be called &quot;Lover Come Back.&quot; Her son Thomas, who became a newspaper executive and a patron of the arts, donated the funding for a new library in her memory to the Loomis Chaffee School of Windsor, CT, in 1968. The building, designed by architect Kenneth DeMay of Hideo Sasaki&#x27;s firm Sasaki, Dawson, DeMay Associates (now Sasaki Associates), is still in use today at the school. The Katharine Brush Library contains a larger than life-size portrait by Leon Gordon of Katharine Brush looking down the length of the second floor.

Brush&#x27;s short story &quot;Birthday Party&quot; is frequently taught in literature classes. It appeared on the 2005 Advanced Placement English Literature Exam; the story was originally published in The &quot;New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Fiction section on March 16, 1946. Brush&#x27;s Connecticut home was featured on a 2006 episode of HGTV&#x27;s &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot;.

<doc id="794855" wikidata="Q16829226" url="?curid=794855" title="A Defence of General Funston">
<text>&quot;A Defence of General Funston&quot; is a satirical piece written by Mark Twain lampooning US Army General and expansionism advocate Frederick Funston. Funston had been a colonel during the Spanish–American and Philippine–American Wars, and Twain had been an outspoken critic of these wars, as immoral ventures of the American state into the imperialist subjugation of foreign peoples and territories.

In the piece, Twain essentially excoriates Funston as a scoundrel for the tactics he employed in capturing the Filipino president Emilio Aguinaldo, while at the same time facetiously arguing that Funston is not responsible for any of his actions since it was not Funston himself but his &quot;inborn disposition&quot; that determined his actions for him. As this is the only ground upon which Twain makes his &quot;defence&quot;, the overall effect is to ironically and comically emphasize Twain&#x27;s view that Funston&#x27;s actions were completely indefensible.

<doc id="794856" wikidata="Q2939002" url="?curid=794856" title="Carl Storck">
<text>:&quot;This is about the American football executive, not to be confused with sculptors Carol Storck or Karl Storck
Carl H. Storck (born November 14, 1892 – March 13, 1950) was a co-founder of the National Football League (NFL), as well as the founding owner of the Dayton Triangles. He was also the Triangles coach from 1922 to 1926. Storck served as the NFL&#x27;s secretary-treasurer from 1921 to 1939 and president from 1939 to 1941.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Carl Storck was born November 14, 1892, in Dayton, Ohio. He lived in that city throughout his life, attending Stivers High School, where he was a three sport athlete — a football halfback, basketball guard, and a sprinter and shot-putter on the track and field squad.

After graduating from high school in 1913, Storck pursued a career in the YMCA movement. He attended the YMCA&#x27;s preparatory training course at Lake Geneva before accepting a position as second assistant physical education director for the Dayton YMCA in July 1914.

On October 1, 1916, Storck left for Chicago to attend the YMCA Training School there. He was simultaneously made the physical director of the Sears and Roebuck Company YMCA club in Chicago.

Storck returned to Dayton in 1919, where he took a position with the personnel department of the General Motors Corporation there. He remained in that professional capacity in addition to his football avocation through the first half of the 1930s.

After his return, Storck took the reigns as manager of the Dayton Triangles professional basketball team. While successful on the court, the team was plagued by poor attendance, however, resulting in an abrupt shutting down of home games and completion of a truncated schedule on the road. It would not be the last time that lack of fan support in Dayton interfered with Storck&#x27;s best-laid plans.

===Dayton Triangles===
After his return to Dayton from Chicago, Storck tried his hand at professional football, playing weekends for the St. Marys Cadets before assuming the helm of the venerable Dayton Triangles as player-coach. In this capacity as head of the Triangles, Storck became a founder of the National Football League, representing the club at the September 17, 1920, meeting at Ralph Hay&#x27;s Hupmobile dealership which formally organized the American Professional Football Association, forerunner of the NFL.

The Triangles would have trouble competing in the increasingly competitive NFL, however, and would be plagued by poor attendance throughout their existence.

Storck would remain head of the Triangles franchise until its sale in 1928 to Bill Dwyer, who moved the team to Brooklyn and renamed them the Brooklyn Dodgers.

===League officer===

Storck served as secretary-treasurer of the National Football League from 1921 to 1939. 

Upon the death of Joe Carr, Storck served as president of the NFL during its 1939 and 1940 seasons.

===The NFL restructures===

As the public presence of the NFL grew, it sought to professionalize its apparatus. The ten owners of the NFL came to a decision in 1940 to supplant the role of league president by following the path blazed by Major League Baseball by hiring and empowering a prominent Commissioner. Corinne Griffith, wife of Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall, recalled this process in her 1947 memoir: &quot;A big name was desired by all. Draft meetings were postponed, schedules sidetracked, and football players forgotten. The hunt for a big name began. Every living famous name in the United States was suggested, I believe.&quot;
Former Notre Dame great Elmer Layden, an undersized fullback who gained fame as a member of Knute Rockne&#x27;s legendary &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; backfield of 1924, was decided upon. A lucrative five-year contract was bestowed upon Layden to induce him to leave his comfortable position as head coach and athletic director of Notre Dame.

League President Carl Storck was the odd man out under this restructuring. He had given twenty years of his life to the NFL — most of them unpaid — as a league official and had performed his duties capably. He was not the subject of criticism during his tenure as president. Now he was seemingly rendered a veritable minister without portfolio or even function.

Initially, Storck stated that he would on the job as league president if the owners defined his duties in a contract. However, on April 4, 1941, he abruptly reversed course and announced that he would be resigning the position &quot;for the best interests of the game&quot;.

===Life outside football===

Storck worked full-time as a foreman in the Inspection and Packing Department of the National Cash Register Company. He then worked as assistant manager at Delco.

In 1939, Storck served as president of the Dayton Wings baseball franchise of the Middle Atlantic League.

===Illness and death===

At the time of his resignation, Storck was seriously ill with Neurasthenia. He had been bedridden for seven weeks prior to his resignation and was partially paralyzed on the right side of his body. He retired from Delco in 1942 due to ill health. Storck died on March 13, 1950, at a nursing home in Dayton.

When Robert Mantell, the head of a Shakespearean touring theatre company, remarked that he liked Bulliet&#x27;s theater reviews, Bulliet offered to become his press agent. Bulliet traveled in advance of the company throughout the United States and Canada during a period of nine years, except for one year when he was a regional publicist for D. W. Griffith&#x27;s silent film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915). After a brief return to newspaper journalism in Louisville, Kentucky, Bulliet moved to Chicago to edit &quot;Magazine of the Art World&quot;, a weekly periodical published by the &quot;Chicago Evening Post&quot;. Art criticism remained his primary occupation even after the &quot;Post&quot; was assimilated by the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1932.

Bulliet played a role in popularizing of modern art in the Midwestern United States, and in organizing Chicago&#x27;s independent artists, who felt snubbed by the conservative tastes that dominated the Chicago Art Institute.

=== Personal life ===
He was married to southern Indiana artist Katherine Adams Bulliet; they had one son, Leander Jackson. After the death of his first wife in 1947 he married Catherine Girdler Bulliet. C. J. Bulliet is the grandfather of Columbia University historian Richard Bulliet. 

For a time his lover was the painter Macena Barton, who once challenged his assertion that no woman had ever painted a worthwhile nude.

<text>The Old Bull and Bush is a Grade II listed public house at North End near Hampstead Heath in London, which gave its name to the music hall song &quot;Down at the old Bull and Bush&quot;, sung by Florrie Forde. It is located on North End Way.

The Old Bull and Bush is managed by Mitchells and Butlers under the Premium Country Dining Group brand.
The interior was renovated to a modern, gastropub style in 2006. Until the introduction of the smoking ban in England in 2007, The Bull and Bush was one of the few completely smoke-free pubs in London.

==History==
The earliest record of a building on the site is of a farmhouse in 1645. The farmhouse gained a licence to sell ale in 1721. William Hogarth drank here, and is believed to have been involved in planting out the pub garden.

The pub gained a music licence in 1867, when Henry Humphries was the landlord. The pub became popular as a day trip for cockneys.

The building underwent a major reconstruction in 1924, when owned by the Ind Coope brewery. Another refurbishment took place in 1987.

In 2006, the interior was renovated to a modern, gastropub style with an openly visible kitchen, and reopened to the public on 24 March that year.

==Bull and Bush tube station==
Near to the pub was the site of the proposed North End tube station (also called &quot;Bull and Bush&quot;) on the Northern line of the London Underground. Only the platforms were excavated, and the station construction was cancelled. An entrance (for emergency use only) leading down 197 steps to platform level is located on Hampstead Way.

<text>is a Japanese electrical engineer who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002 for developing a novel method for mass spectrometric analyses of biological macromolecules with John Bennett Fenn and Kurt Wüthrich (the latter for work in NMR spectroscopy).

==Early life and education==
Tanaka was born and raised in Toyama, Japan, his biological mother died one month after he was born. Tanaka graduated from Tohoku University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1983, afterward he joined Shimadzu Corporation, where he engaged in the development of mass spectrometers.

==Soft laser desorption==

For mass spectrometry analyses of a macromolecule, such as a protein, the analyte must be ionized and vaporized by laser irradiation. The problem is that the direct irradiation of an intense laser pulse on a macromolecule causes cleavage of the analyte into tiny fragments and the loss of its structure. In February 1985, Tanaka found that by using a mixture of ultra fine metal powder in glycerol as a matrix, an analyte can be ionized without losing its structure. His work was filed as a patent application in 1985, and after the patent application was made public reported at the Annual Conference of the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan held in Kyoto, in May 1987 and became known as soft laser desorption (SLD).

However, there was some criticism about his winning the prize, saying that contribution by two German scientists, Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas was also big enough not to be dismissed, and therefore they should also be included as prize winners. This is because they first reported in 1985 a method, with higher sensitivity using a small organic compound as a matrix, that they named matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Also Tanaka&#x27;s SLD is not used currently for biomolecules analysis, meanwhile MALDI is widely used in mass spectrometry research laboratories. But while MALDI was developed prior to SLD, it was not used to ionize proteins until after Tanaka&#x27;s report.

==Recognition==

<text>Adolf Georg Wilhelm Busch (8 August 1891 – 9 June 1952) was a German-Swiss violinist, conductor, and composer.

== Life and career ==
Busch was born in Siegen in Westphalia. He studied at the Cologne Conservatory with Willy Hess and Bram Eldering. His composition teacher was Fritz Steinbach but he also learned much from his future father-in-law Hugo Grüters in Bonn.

In 1912, Busch founded the Vienna Konzertverein Quartet, consisting of the principals from the Konzertverein orchestra, which made its debut at the 1913 Salzburg Festival. After World War I, he founded the Busch Quartet, which from the 1920–21 season included Gösta Andreasson, violin, Karl Doktor, viola, and Paul Grümmer, cello. The quartet was in existence with varying personnel until 1951.

The additional member of the circle was Rudolf Serkin, who became Busch&#x27;s duo partner at 18 and eventually married Busch&#x27;s daughter, Irene, 1935 in Basel. The Busch Quartet and Serkin became the nucleus of the Busch Chamber Players, founded in Basel, a forerunner of modern chamber orchestras.

In 1927, with the rise of Adolf Hitler, Busch decided he could not in good conscience stay in Germany, so he emigrated to Basel, Switzerland. Busch was not Jewish and was popular in Germany, but firmly opposed Nazism from the beginning. On 1 April 1933, he repudiated Germany altogether and in 1938, he boycotted Italy. As the Nazis tried to convince him to return to Germany, he declared that he would &quot;return with joy on the day that Hitler, Goebbels und Göring are publicly hanged.&quot; In 1935, he became a Swiss citizen of Riehen, Basel. During 12 years in Basel and besides his many concerts around the world, he founded a chamber orchestra in Basel, was a co-founder of the Lucerne Festival in 1938, together with Arturo Toscanini and his conducting brother Fritz Busch, and taught many students in Basel, among them Yehudi Menuhin. On the outbreak of World War II, Busch emigrated from Basel to the United States in 1939, where he eventually settled in Vermont. There, he was one of the founders with Rudolf Serkin of the Marlboro Music School and Festival.

The Busch Quartet was particularly admired for its interpretations of Brahms, Schubert, and above all Beethoven. It made a series of recordings in the 1930s that included many of these composers&#x27; works for string quartet. In 1941, it set down three Beethoven quartets that it had not previously recorded, including Opus 130. The Busch Quartet never recorded the Grosse Fuge, Opus 133; an arrangement was recorded by the Busch Chamber Players, with Busch leading from the first violin desk.

Busch was a great soloist, as well as a chamber musician, and live recordings exist of him playing the Beethoven, Brahms, Dvorák and Busoni Concertos, as well as the Brahms Double Concerto. In the studio he recorded concertos and chamber orchestra performances of Bach and Mozart, and of the Concerti grossi, op.6 by Handel; his recordings of Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concertos brought them to prominence after many years of relative obscurity. He had a highly individual tone and great technique. Among his students were Stefi Geyer, Erica Morini and Yehudi Menuhin.

As a composer, Busch was influenced by Max Reger. He was among the first to compose a Concerto for Orchestra, in 1929. A number of his compositions have been recorded, including the Violin Concerto (A minor, opus 20, published 1922), String Sextet (G major, opus 40), Quintet for Saxophone and String Quartet, Violin Sonata No 2, Op. 56, Clarinet Sonata, and several large scale works for organ. Regarding the last, Busch once remarked that if he could come back after his death he would like to return as an organist.

He was the son of the luthier Wilhelm Busch; brother of the conductor Fritz Busch, the cellist Hermann Busch, the pianist Heinrich Busch and the actor Willi Busch, father in law of the pianist Rudolf Serkin and maternal grandfather of the pianist Peter Serkin and the cellist Judith Serkin. An exhaustive two-volume biography of Busch by Tully Potter was published in 2010 by Toccata Press In November 2015, Warner Classics released a 16-CD collection of Busch&#x27;s recordings of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, and other composers.

<doc id="794866" wikidata="Q15989591" url="?curid=794866" title="Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)">
<text>Helmut Schmidt (21 February 1928 – 18 August 2011) was a German-born physicist and parapsychologist whose experiments on extrasensory perception were widely criticized for machine bias, methodological errors and lack of replication. Critics also noted that necessary precautions were not taken to rule out the possibility of fraud.

==Biography==
Schmidt was born in Danzig, Germany. He was educated at the University of Göttingen (M.A., 1953) and obtained a Ph.D. in physics from University of Cologne in 1958. He taught theoretical physics at universities in America, Germany and Canada.

In the 1960s Schmidt carried out experiments into clairvoyance and precognition. In the early 1970s he pioneered research into the effects of human consciousness on machines called random number generators or random event generators at the Rhine Research Center Institute for Parapsychology. He was appointed Research Director of the Institute in 1969.

Schmidt initially conducted experiments with electronic random event generators of either a flashing red or green light. Subjects would attempt to make one illuminate more than the other by psychic means. Schmidt reported success rates of 1–2% above what would be expected at random over a large number of trials. He has been credited by critics of parapsychology as the researcher with the most sophisticated approach to the methodological design of parapsychological experiments.

==Reception==
Critics have written Schmidt&#x27;s experiments in parapsychology have not been replicated. Schmidt worked alone with no one checking his experiments. He was accused of being a careless experimenter.

The psychologist C. E. M. Hansel found flaws in all of Schmidt&#x27;s experiments into clairvoyance, precognition and psychokinesis. Hansel found that necessary precautions were not taken, there was no presence of an observer or second-experimenter in any of the experiments, no counterchecking of the records and no separate machines used for high and low score attempts. There were weaknesses in the design of the experiments that did not rule out the possibility of trickery. There was little control of the experimenter and unsatisfactory features of the machine employed. Regarding the machine used in the experiments, Hansel wrote:

The most obvious weakness in Schmidt&#x27;s machine is that the results are in no case recorded positively inside the machine. They are only revealed after processing data obtained from the resettable counters in the machine or from the paper punch connected it. While machines may be foolproof, human beings seldom are... If Schmidt had used two machines, his scores for high- and low-aiming runs could have been kept separate from the start. Nonresettable counters could have ensured that all attempts were recorded and some supervision of the use and recording of the counters would have instilled more confidence into readers of the reports than they are likely to have at present.

The psychologists Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones supported Hansel and also noted:

The effect obtained by Schmidt and others is very small, at most a 2% deviation from the 50% chance level. Because of the very large number of trials that can be run with the REG in a short period of time (each trial lasts only a second or less), the odds against even such minuscule deviations range from 100 to 1 to several billions to 1. When, in addition to assessing the statistical significance of the results, their clinical or practical significance is also assessed using the appropriate statistics, it turns out to be practically zero... It can be assumed that the smaller the absolute size of a measured effect, the greater the likelihood that the effect is due to some extraneous, uncontrolled variable. In the REG experiments, statistical significance of the results is achieved only against a background of a very large number of trials, and the practical significance of the results is concomitantly zero. It can be, therefore, also assumed that such results are probably the outcome of one or more uncontrolled variable.

According to the physicist Victor Stenger &quot;While Schmidt claims positive results, his experiments also lack adequate statistical significance and have not been successfully replicated in the thirty-five years since his first experiments were reported.&quot;

The psychologist James Alcock wrote that he found &quot;serious methodological errors&quot; throughout Schmidt&#x27;s work which rendered his conclusions of psychokinesis untenable. This included criticism of Schmidt acting both as experimenter and subject and lack of clarification and detail from his reports such as the possibility of optional stopping during the experiments.

Schmidt has also drawn criticism for endorsing the psychic claims of Uri Geller.

<doc id="794868" wikidata="Q5860371" url="?curid=794868" title="Mushy peas">
<text>Mushy peas are dried marrowfat peas which are first soaked overnight in water with baking soda, and then rinsed in fresh water, after which the peas are gathered in a saucepan, covered with water, and brought to a boil, and then simmered until the peas are softened. The mush is seasoned with salt and pepper.

Throughout England and Scotland they are a traditional accompaniment to fish and chips. In Northern England they are also commonly served as part of a popular snack called pie and peas (akin to the South Australian pie floater; but instead of the thick pea soup of the floater, in pie and peas it is mushy peas which accompany the meat pie) and are considered to be a part of traditional British cuisine. They are sometimes also packed into a ball, dipped in batter, deep-fried, and served as a pea fritter. Mushy peas can also be bought ready-prepared in tin cans.

== Local variants ==

In Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and parts of Lincolnshire, mushy peas are often served as a snack on their own. In Nottinghamshire they are traditionally accompanied by mint sauce, and sold at open-air events such as fairs or fêtes. In Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, mushy peas served with chips is called a &#x27;pea mix&#x27;. 
A variant (particularly popular around Bolton and Bury of Greater Manchester, and Preston, Lancashire) is parched peas – carlin peas (also known as maple peas or black peas) soaked and then boiled slowly for a long time; these peas are traditionally served with vinegar.

Mushy peas have occasionally been referred to as &quot;Yorkshire caviar.&quot;

==Artificial colouring==
Most commercially produced mushy peas contain artificial colourants to make them green; without these the dish would be murky grey.
Traditionally the controversial colourant tartrazine (E102) had been used as one of the colourants; however, as recently as 2019, major manufacturers were using a combination of brilliant blue FCF (E133) and riboflavin (E101).

<doc id="794879" wikidata="Q4571400" url="?curid=794879" title="1963–64 United States network television schedule">
<text>The following is the 1963–64 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1963 through August 1964. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1962–63 season.

ABC began its new fall schedule a week early, beating CBS and NBC out of the starting gate. New series debuting this week included sci-fi anthology &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, police/lawyer series &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, drama &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and game show &quot;100 Grand&quot;. ABC also completely revamped its Friday night schedule, with two new series: detective show &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, sitcom &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and returning boxing program &quot;The Fight of the Week&quot;. &quot;Fight&quot; would mark the end of boxing on network television. Weekly boxing telecasts had debuted on network TV in 1940 and had enjoyed a run on all networks at various times, but after September 11, 1964, weekly primetime boxing series would disappear entirely from network television. ABC introduced two variety hours that fall with &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; and the short lived &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot;.

CBS&#x27;s success with rural comedies &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; had convinced the network that rural sitcoms would continue to be popular. As a result, CBS president James Aubrey added what some critics described as an &quot;endless procession of country clones [of] the wildly successful &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;&quot; to the network&#x27;s schedule. &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, from the same producers of &quot;Hillbillies&quot;, debuted on September 24. CBS also brought two show business veterans to weekly variety television that year with &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; and &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;.

Westerns continued to be popular on television, and all three networks scheduled several Western series. NBC, in particular, retained a number of Westerns on its fall 1963 schedule: two returning series &quot;The Virginian&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and new series &quot;Temple Houston&quot;, and &quot;Redigo&quot;. NBC&#x27;s Western-heavy schedule would pay off, as &quot;Bonanza&quot; again became the second highest-rated TV series in the Nielsen ratings that year; &quot;The Virginian&quot; reached #17. CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; reached #20. However, some Westerns from the previous season were cancelled, some examples are Laramie and Empire, which due to low ratings.

On July 17, 1963, NBC removed &quot;The Robert Taylor Show&quot; from the lineup due to conflicts between the producers and the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

All times are Eastern and Pacific. New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

Two landmark events occurred during this network TV season. The first was the JFK assassination, which took place on Friday, November 22, 1963. Many programs that were originally scheduled to air in prime time on that weekend had to be pushed back to the following weekend due to all three networks broadcasting news coverage that would last until November 26.

The second event was the live American debut of The Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on February 9, 1964. An estimated 73 million people tuned in to watch the Fab Four perform on the program, which made it one of the highest rated TV episodes in the history of prime-time television.

<text>The Rhine Research Center is an independent, non-profit parapsychology research center that takes a scientific approach to anomalous phenomena and exceptional human experience. According to the mission statement, the &quot;Rhine&#x27;s mission is to advance the science of parapsychology, to provide education and resources for the public, and to foster a community for individuals with personal and professional interest in PSI.&quot; It is the successor to the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University.

In 1965, when J. B. Rhine reached mandatory retirement age, he left Duke University and founded an independent non-profit organization called the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man. The current research center is a successor to this organization, and it is no longer affiliated with Duke University. The Rhine Research Center continues to conduct parapsychology research today, but it also provides online courses, educational events, and holds meetings for people interested in parapsychology and psychic phenomena. The current president is Loyd Auerbach.

<text>Vágner Silva de Souza (born 11 June 1984), known as Vágner Love, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Série B club Avaí. He is a forward who has been described by &quot;World Soccer Magazine&quot; as possessing &quot;mobility, flair, awareness and powerful shooting&quot;.

The second name Love was given to Vágner while playing for Palmeiras as he was known for his playboy lifestyle.

Over two spells, Vágner Love scored 117 goals across 241 official games in eight seasons at CSKA Moscow. He won 14 honours in the Russian capital, scoring in their win in the 2005 UEFA Cup Final to become the youngest player to score in a UEFA Cup final.

Vágner Love scored four goals in 20 games for the Brazil national team, winning the Copa América in 2004 and 2007.

==Club career==
===Palmeiras===
Vágner Love started his career with Palmeiras. In the 2003 season, he helped them to return to the Série A, the nation&#x27;s top-flight division, by scoring 19 goals and finishing as Serie B&#x27;s top scorer.

===CSKA Moscow===
In August 2004, Vágner Love was bought by Russian Premier League club CSKA Moscow, where he joined fellow Brazilian creative midfielder Daniel Carvalho, who had transferred before start of the season. Upon his arrival, Vagner Love had an immediate impact; in his debut on 4 August 2004 against Neftchi, he came on as a sub and scored a goal. In the last qualifying round against Scottish club Rangers, Vagner Love scored goals in both legs as CSKA won 3-2 on aggregate and qualified to the Champions League group stage. He also scored 9 goals in the remaining 12 league games, including braces against Rotor Volgograd (3-0), Alania Vladikavkaz (1-4) and FC Moscow (1-4) as the team finished second in a close title race against cross-city rivals Lokomotiv, losing by just one point. He also played in every Champions League group stage game and scored one goal against PSG. In December 2004, CSKA finished third in the group and was relegated to the UEFA Cup knockout stage, where he scored three goals. 

At the end of the football season in Russia, Vagner Love was linked with a move to Corinthians due to homesickness and having trouble adjusting to life in Moscow. However, CSKA refused to sell or loan him.

On 18 May 2005, at the age of , Vágner Love scored the final goal in CSKA&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Sporting CP in the 2005 UEFA Cup Final at the Estádio José Alvalade in Lisbon, making him the youngest player to score in a UEFA Cup final. In addition to winning the UEFA Cup, he has gone on to win the Russian Premier League title and Russian Cup in both 2005 and 2008, as well as the Russian Super Cup in 2006.

Vágner Love became the top scorer in the 2008 season (the first top scorer from outside the former Soviet Union) and the top scorer of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, the latter with 11 goals in 8 games.

====Return to Palmeiras on loan====
On 28 August 2009, following a run of poor form for CSKA, Vágner Love was signed by his former club Palmeiras on a one-year loan deal until 31 July 2010. CSKA press spokesman Sergei Aksenov claimed that Vágner Love left Russia due to &quot;urgent family problems demand(ing) his presence at home in Brazil&quot;.

Vágner Love had a respectable return of 5 goals in 12 games for Palmeiras, but his loan spell was ended prematurely: After publicly stating his concern over his safety at Palmeiras due to off-field altercations with fans, as well as his desire to play for his childhood team Flamengo, the deal was ended early on 14 January 2010.

===Flamengo===
On 15 January 2010, the day after his loan was terminated with Palmeiras, Vágner Love officially signed a loan deal with reigning Brazilian champions Flamengo, through till July 2010. He made his Flamengo debut against Bangu in the Campeonato Carioca on 23 January 2010, scoring two goals.

Vágner Love performed very well playing for Flamengo, scoring 23 goals in 26 matches. His successful strike partnership with Adriano was dubbed by fans as &quot;Império do Amor&quot;, or &quot;The Love Empire&quot;, in reference to Adriano&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Emperor&quot; and Vágner Love&#x27;s artistic surname. The presence of midfielder Dejan Petković in Flamengo&#x27;s squad made supporters start the year with high expectations—it was widely believed that the Serbian&#x27;s passing and free-kick abilities, coupled with Adriano&#x27;s and Vagner&#x27;s prolific scoring, would produce a top team. However, the team failed to advance past the quarter-finals in the 2010 Copa Libertadores. Shortly after, Adriano revealed he wanted to try playing in Italy again, and Flamengo could not convince CSKA to extend Vágner Love&#x27;s loan, thus dismantling the once-promising &quot;Love Empire&quot;.

===Return to CSKA===

After a change of presidency, on 12 January 2013, Flamengo did not pay his pendencies of rights with CSKA, and Vágner Love had to leave the club, returning to Russia after a one-year absence. On 16 January, he was &quot;re-presented&quot; in Moscow and signed a three-year contract extension. He continued his goal scoring record with CSKA on his return to the club, and propelled the club to the Premier League title in 2013 after a goalless draw with Kuban Krasnodar on 18 May, the club&#x27;s first league title since 2006.

===Kairat===

On 3 November 2020, Love scored Kairat&#x27;s first goal, in a 3–1 win over Ordabasy, to clinch their first Kazakhstan Premier League title since 2004. On 5 November 2020, Kairat extended their contract with Vágner Love until the end of the 2021 season.

He made his debut as a substitute in the 4–1 win against Costa Rica, which was his single appearance as Brazil went on to win the competition.

He did not make the final 23-man squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Following the tournament, Vágner Love was named in new manager Dunga&#x27;s first squad for the national team and scored his first goal for the &quot;Seleção&quot; in the same year, against Wales.

<text>Howard Chandler Christy (January 10, 1872 – March 3, 1952) was an American artist and illustrator. Famous for the &quot;Christy Girl&quot; – a colorful and illustrious successor to the &quot;Gibson Girl&quot; – Christy is also widely known for his iconic WWI military recruitment and Liberty loan posters, along with his 1940 masterpiece titled, &quot;Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States&quot;, which is installed along the east stairwell of the United States Capitol.

From the 1920s until the early 1950s, Christy was active as a portrait painter whose sitters included presidents, senators, industrialists, movie stars, and socialites. He painted Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt, and Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. Other famous people he painted include William Randolph Hearst, Edward VIII, Eddie Rickenbacker, Benito Mussolini, Prince Umberto, and Amelia Earhart. By 1938, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Christy as &quot;the most commercially successful U.S. artist.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Christy was born in Morgan County, Ohio and attended early school in Duncan Falls, Ohio. He then attended the Art Students League of New York in New York City from 1890 to 1891 and then at the National Academy under William Merritt Chase, first at Chase&#x27;s summer retreat at Shinnecock Hills, New York on Long Island, and then at his 10th Street Studio.

==Early work==

Christy first attracted attention with his realistic illustrations and several articles as a combat artist during the Spanish–American War that included the Battle of Las Guasimas, the Battle of El Caney, and the Battle of San Juan Hill, published in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and 
&quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazines, and in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Christy gained especial prominence with the series, &quot;Men of the Army and Navy&quot;, and a portrait of Colonel Roosevelt that appeared on the cover of his Rough Riders series published in Scribner&#x27;s. These illustrations propelled Christy to national prominence. From this, he decided to turn away from war and painting men in uniform. Instead, he yearned for beauty and created the &quot;Christy Girl&quot;, redefining the portrayal of women in America through his illustrations and portraits. He captured the modern American woman – tall, confident, elegant, witty, and athletic.

He painted patriotic posters for the US Navy and US Marine Corps. He is also known for his illustrations of the works of such as the well-known war correspondent, Richard Harding Davis.

He illustrated books during this period as well.

==National recognition==

Having made his reputation for his work as a combat artist and in support of America&#x27;s World War I effort, Christy soon was illustrating for numerous magazine covers. He became famous for the &quot;Christy Girl&quot;, a picturesque and romantic type of society women uniquely his own. His work, whether in watercolor, oils, or pen-and-ink, is characterized by great facility, a dashing but not exaggerated style and a strong sense of values. Together with fellow artists Harrison Fisher and Neysa McMein he constituted the &quot;Motion Picture Classic&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; contest jury of 1921–22, that discovered the It girl, Clara Bow.

In 1924, Christy painted the official portrait of First Lady Grace Coolidge featuring her white collie Rob Roy, that was hung in the Red Room of the White House and has been displayed in the China Room since the Kennedy administration.

During the Great Depression, Christy found new success as a muralist and painter of historical events. In 1934 he painted a series of female nudes to decorate the New York City restaurant Café des Artistes. Some of Christy&#x27;s works, newly cleaned, are on display at The Leopard at des Artistes restaurant, the successor to the Café des Artistes. They include six panels of wood nymphs and paintings such as &quot;The Parrot Girl&quot;, &quot;The Swing Girl&quot;, &quot;Ponce De Leon&quot;, &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, and the &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot;.

In 1940, he painted the &quot;Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States&quot;, which was installed in the House of Representatives wing in the United States Capitol.

Christy&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Dorothy Barton Thomas&quot; is in the Zanesville Museum of Art in Zanesville, Ohio, along with other Christy posters, prints and paintings in their collection. Another of Christy&#x27;s paintings was displayed at the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center. The National Museum of American Illustration in Newport, RI, has a large collection of works by Christy.

A Christy hangs above a desk and typewriter in Jack London&#x27;s cottage, located in Jack London State Historic Park, Glen Ellen, California.

==Personal life==
Christy was married twice, both times to women who had modeled for him as one of his &quot;Christy Girls&quot;. The first was Maebelle Gertrude Thompson, whom he married on October 15, 1898, shortly after his return from the Spanish–American War. They had a daughter named Natalie Chandler Christy. They finally divorced in May 1919, after over ten years of periodic separation, bitter divorce, and custody battles.

His second marriage was to Nancy Mae (née Coone) Palmer, a widow who had modeled for him for over eight years prior to their marriage.

In the early 1930s, he met Elise Ford who became his model for the murals on Café des Artistes wall. Elise Ford was also Christy&#x27;s model for the 1941 &quot;I Am An American&quot; poster personifying America &quot;rushing forward to give the touch of the contagion of liberty and democracy to the rest of the world&quot; in the words of then New York Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Forty years his junior, she became Christy&#x27;s companion until his death at age 80. They had a daughter named Holly (Holly Christina Longuski née Holly Ford) born in 1939 while he was painting &quot;Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States&quot;.

Christy was the cousin of actor Chick Chandler.

== Legacy ==
Attorney and author James Philip Head wrote a novelistic biography of Christy, &quot;The Magic of Youth&quot;, published in 2016. It is the first book in a projected trilogy titled &quot;An Affair with Beauty - The Mystique of Howard Chandler Christy&quot;. &quot;Romantic Illusions&quot;, the second installment in the trilogy, was released in March 2019.

Helen Frances Copley (1935–2021) documented her research into the life of Christy in her 1999 book &quot;The Christy Quest&quot;. Copley&#x27;s viewing of Christy&#x27;s painting of Christ &quot;The Coming Peace and Prince of Peace&quot; led her to ten years of research to better understand the man behind the unusual portrayal of Jesus. In 2017, Copley donated her substantial collection of items related to Christy&#x27;s career as a book and magazine illustrator and the Christy Girl to Laffayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="794889" wikidata="Q6170934" url="?curid=794889" title="Jean Kane Foulke du Pont">
<text>Jean Kane Foulke du Pont (May 21, 1891 – November 6, 1985) was an American suffragette, prison reform activist and philanthropist.

==Biography==
Jean Kane Foulke was born in West Chester, Lenape, Pennsylvania to George Rhyfedd Foulke and Jean (Kane) Foulke. She was the granddaughter of William Foulke, who discovered the first full dinosaur skeleton in North America (&quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;), in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in 1858.

She grew up in West Chester, at Bala Farm and attended the Misses Hebb&#x27;s School in Wilmington, Delaware. She married industrialist Éleuthère Paul du Pont on June 9, 1910. Her husband was a member of the prominent Du Pont family and the founder of Du Pont Motors. They had six sons: Éleuthère Paul, Jr. (1911); Francis George (1913); Stephen (1915); Benjamin Bonneau (1919); 
Robert Jacques (1923); and Alexis Irénée (1928). Stephen, an aviation enthusiast, was inducted into the Soaring Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Activism==
Foulke du Pont was a progressive woman for her era, and her passion was prison reform; in 1919 she helped found The Prisoners&#x27; Aid Society of Delaware as well as Bridge House, a detention home for juvenile offenders in the Browntown section of Wilmington, that was open until 1989.

Foulke du Pont was exceedingly active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement; in 1916 she picketed the White House with a troop of Delaware women in an effort to persuade President Woodrow Wilson to become active in the cause.

During World War I, Foulke du Pont was a leader in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary for the Delaware Committee, as well as the Council of National Defense. She was also responsible for several &quot;Save the Babies&quot; stations, which resulted in Delaware&#x27;s &quot;Pure Milk Legislation&quot; intended to protect milk sold for babies, and also led to child welfare programs in Delaware. Foulke du Pont also played an important role in the creation of Delaware&#x27;s present Family Court. There is a plaque in her honor at the Family Court in Wilmington, dedicated in 1963.

In 1964, she contacted the University of Delaware seeking a training and educational program for the Delaware&#x27;s correctional workers, to benefit those &quot;working in probation, parole, family court, and youth services, as well as the guards in state prisons.&quot;

She created a $400,000 endowment (equivalent of $3 million in 2014) in honor of her husband, the &quot;E. Paul du Pont Endowment for the Study of Crime, Delinquency, and Corrections,&quot; if the university agreed to train the correctional personnel. She also donated a 10-year grant to encourage the university faculty to study prison reform and prisoner rehabilitation issues through the sociology department. This eventually led to the university&#x27;s criminal justice program. She also made additional yearly donations to the sociology department to study social welfare.

<doc id="794891" wikidata="Q356444" url="?curid=794891" title="Judd Winick">
<text>Judd Winick (born February 12, 1970) is an American cartoonist, comic book writer and screenwriter, as well as a former reality television personality. He first gained fame for his stint on MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot; in 1994, before finding success as a comic book creator with &quot;Pedro and Me&quot;, an autobiographical graphic novel about his friendship with &quot;The Real World&quot; castmate and AIDS educator Pedro Zamora. Winick wrote lengthy runs on DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series and created &quot;The Life and Times of Juniper Lee&quot; animated TV series for Cartoon Network, which ran for three seasons.

As part of his run on &quot;Batman&quot;, Winick wrote the 2005 storyline &quot;&quot;, which featured the return of Jason Todd, the second Robin (who was murdered by the Joker in the 1988 storyline &quot;&quot;), now operating as the anti-hero Red Hood. Winick also wrote the prequel miniseries &quot;Red Hood: The Lost Days&quot;, which detailed the exact nature of Todd&#x27;s resurrection, as well as the animated film &quot;&quot;, which adapted his original story to screen.

==Early life and career==
Winick was born February 12, 1970, to a Jewish family, and grew up in Dix Hills, New York. In his youth Winick initially read superhero comics, but this changed when he read Kyle Baker&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Why I Hate Saturn&quot;, which Winick said in a 2015 interview he still reads once a year. Winick also cites &quot;Bloom County: Loose Tails&quot; by Berke Breathed as the first collection of that strip that changed his life, one which prompted him to spend the next ten years &quot;horribly aping&quot; Breathed&#x27;s style.

Winick graduated from high school in 1988 and entered the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor&#x27;s School of Art, intending to emulate his cartoonist heroes, including Breathed and Garry Trudeau. His comic strip, &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot;, began running in the school&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot;, in his freshman year, and he was selected to speak at graduation. The university published a small print-run of a collection of his strips called &quot;Watching the Spin-Cycle: The Nuts &amp; Bolts Collection&quot;. In his senior year, Universal Press Syndicate, which syndicates strips such as &quot;Doonesbury&quot; and &quot;Calvin &amp; Hobbes&quot;, offered Winick a development contract.

After graduation, Winick lived in an apartment in Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts, with fellow writer Brad Meltzer, struggling to develop &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot; for UPS, while working at a bookstore. On January 1, 1993, UPS decided not to renew Winick&#x27;s strip for syndication, feeling it could not compete in the current market. Winick was unable to secure syndication with another company, and was forced to move back in with his parents by the middle of 1993, doing unfulfilling T-shirt work for beer companies. Winick had &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; in development with the children&#x27;s television network Nickelodeon as an animated series, even turning the human characters into mice, and proposing new titles like &quot;Young Urban Mice&quot; and &quot;Rat Race&quot;, but nothing came of it.

===&quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot;===

Winick applied to be on MTV network&#x27;s reality TV show, &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot;, hoping for fame and a career boost. During the casting process, the producers of the show conducted an in-person, videotaped interview with Winick. When asked how he would feel about living with someone who was HIV-positive, Winick gave what he thought was an enthusiastic, politically correct answer, despite reservations. Winick was accepted as a cast member on the show in January 1994. The producers informed the housemates that they would be living with someone who was HIV-positive, but they did not reveal who it was. Winick and his six castmates (Mohammed Bilal, Rachel Campos, Pam Ling, Cory Murphy, David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey, and Pedro Zamora) moved into the house at 949 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12, Winick&#x27;s 24th birthday. Winick became roommates with Pedro Zamora. Although Cory Murphy, who was the first housemate to meet Zamora, learned that he was HIV-positive when they took the train together from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Winick learned that Zamora was the housemate who had AIDS after Winick and Zamora had decided to be roommates, when Zamora told him that he was an AIDS educator, and subsequently showed his scrapbook to Winick and the other housemates.

Winick&#x27;s &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot; strip began running in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; in March of that year.

Winick, who is Jewish, was offended at Rainey&#x27;s decision to wear a T-shirt depicting four guns arranged in the shape of a swastika, and by Rainey&#x27;s refusal to accede to Winick&#x27;s request not to wear it.

After filming of the season ended, Winick and Ling moved to Los Angeles to continue their relationship.

By August 1994, Zamora&#x27;s health began to decline. After being hospitalized, he asked Winick to substitute for him at a national AIDS education lecture. When Zamora died on November 11, 1994, Winick and Ling were at his bedside. Winick would continue Zamora&#x27;s educational work for some time after that.

===1994 – 2001===

Winick designed illustrations for &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide to...&quot; series of books, and did over 300 of them, including that series’ computer-oriented line. A collection of the computer-related titles&#x27; cartoons was published in 1997 as &quot;Terminal Madness, The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide Computer Cartoon Collection&quot;.

While working on &quot;Pedro and Me&quot;, Winick began working on comic books, beginning with a one-page &quot;Frumpy the Clown&quot; cartoon in Oni Press’ anthology series, &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot; #3, in 1998, before going on to do longer stories, like the two-part &quot;Road Trip&quot;, which was published in issues #9 and 10 of the same book. &quot;Road Trip&quot; went on to become an Eisner Award nominee for Best Sequential Story.

Winick followed up with a three-issue miniseries, &quot;The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius&quot;, about a cynical, profane grade school whiz kid, who invents a myriad of futuristic devices that no one other than his best friend knows about. &quot;Barry Ween&quot; was published by Image Comics from March through May 1999, with two subsequent miniseries, &quot;The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius 2.0&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius: Monkey Tales&quot; (Retitled &quot;The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius 3&quot; or &quot;The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius: Gorilla Warfare&quot; in the collected editions), published by Oni Press, which published trade paperback collections of all three miniseries.

Winick’s graphic novel, &quot;Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss, and What I Learned&quot;, was published in September 2000. It was awarded six American Library Association awards, was nominated for an Eisner Award, won Winick his first GLAAD award, has been praised by creators such as Frank Miller, Neil Gaiman, and Armistead Maupin, and has been incorporated into school curricula across the country.

===DC Comics, television work and &quot;Hilo&quot;===
Winick&#x27;s work in mainstream superhero comics received attention for storylines in which he explores gay or AIDS-oriented themes. In his first regular writing assignment on a monthly superhero comic book, DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, Winick wrote a storyline in which Terry Berg, an assistant of the title character, emerged as a gay character in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #137 (June 2001) and in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #154 (November 2002) the story entitled &quot;Hate Crime&quot; gained media recognition when Terry was brutally beaten in a homophobic attack. Winick was interviewed on Phil Donahue&#x27;s show on MSNBC for that storyline on August 15, 2002, and received two more GLAAD awards for his &quot;Green Lantern&quot; work.

In 2003, Judd Winick left &quot;Green Lantern&quot; for another DC series, &quot;Green Arrow&quot;, beginning with issue #26 of that title (July 2003). He gained more media recognition for &quot;Green Arrow&quot; #43 (December 2004) in which he revealed that Green Arrow&#x27;s 17-year-old ward, a former runaway-turned prostitute named Mia Dearden, was HIV-positive. In issue #45 (February 2005), Winick had Dearden take on the identity of Speedy, the second such Green Arrow sidekick to bear that name, making her the most prominent HIV-positive superhero to star in an ongoing comic book, a decision for which Winick was interviewed on CNN.

In 2003 Winick wrote a five-issue miniseries for DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint called &quot;Blood &amp; Water&quot;, about a young man with terminal illness whose two friends reveal to him that they are vampires, and that they wish to save his life by turning him into a vampire himself.
Winick&#x27;s other comic book work includes &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Exiles&quot;. In 2005 he co-wrote &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;, a one-shot comic that initiated the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, with Geoff Johns and Greg Rucka. Winick was responsible for bringing Jason Todd, the second character known as Batman&#x27;s sidekick Robin, back from the dead, and making him the new Red Hood, the second such Batman villain by that name. That same year, Winick created an animated TV show named &quot;The Life and Times of Juniper Lee&quot; in 2005, which ran for three seasons on the Cartoon Network. Along with creating the show and the characters, he has also directed the voice actors alongside Susan Blu.

Between September 2005 and March 2006, Winick wrote the four-issue Captain Marvel/Superman limited series, &quot;Superman/Shazam: First Thunder&quot; with art by Josh Middleton. Winick continued his work with the Marvel Family in a 12-issue limited series titled &quot;The Trials Of Shazam!&quot;, and continued his Green Arrow work with 2007&#x27;s &quot;Green Arrow/Black Canary Wedding Special&quot;, which led to the ongoing series &quot;Green Arrow and Black Canary&quot;, the first 14 issues of which Winick wrote. In November 2007, DC released a &quot;Teen Titans East&quot; special, a prequel for &quot;Titans&quot;, which was scripted by Winick. Following the &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; storyline, Winick took over the writing on &quot;Batman&quot; for four issues. He co-wrote the 26-issue biweekly &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot; with Keith Giffen, a title which alternated with &quot;Brightest Day&quot;. In addition, he was a regular writer on the monthly &quot;Power Girl&quot; series.

Winick wrote the screenplay for the 2010 direct to DVD animated feature &quot;&quot;, which was based on the 1988–89 story arc &quot;&quot; and the 2005 &quot;&quot; story arc that he wrote in the &quot;Batman&quot; comic book.

Beginning in September 2011, Winick began writing new &quot;Catwoman&quot; and &quot;Batwing&quot; ongoing series that were launched as part of DC Comics&#x27; reboot of its continuity, The New 52. The &quot;Catwoman&quot; series was criticized by some readers for its focus on Selina Kyle&#x27;s sexuality, particularly scenes showing her sexual relationship with Batman. Winick responded that it was DC that desired this tone.

Winick was the head writer on &quot;The Awesomes&quot;, an animated superhero comedy series created by Seth Meyers and Mike Shoemaker for Hulu. It debuted on August 1, 2013, and ended on November 3, 2015.

In July 2012 Winick announced that he was leaving &quot;Catwoman&quot; after issue #12, in order to create an all-ages, original graphic novel called &quot;Hilo&quot; (pronounced &quot;High-Low&quot;), a move that Winick explained was inspired a year or so prior when his then-seven-year-old son asked to read his work. Not having age-appropriate material for him, Winick gave him Jeff Smith&#x27;s &quot;Bone&quot;, which both father and son enjoyed, and decided to create an all-ages story that his son could read. The full color series, whose tone and visuals Winick describes as &quot;part &quot;E.T.&quot;, part &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, part &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;&quot;, stars a small town boy named D.J. whose life takes an unexpected turn when a mysterious boy named Hilo falls from the sky, and takes D.J. and his friend Gina on adventures that include robots, aliens and a quest to save the world. The series represents Winick&#x27;s first artwork since 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius: Gorilla Warfare&quot;, as well as his first children&#x27;s book. It is published by Random House, with the first book published in September 2015. The deal is for three books, though Winick plans to have a total of six graphic novels by the time the story is finished, and hopes to release a book every six months. The first two volumes of the Hilo series, &quot;Hilo, the Boy Who Crashed to Earth&quot; and &quot;Hilo, Saving the Whole Wide World&quot;, are &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers. The HILO series has successfully continued with the 11th book in the series slated for publication in February 2025.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Pedro&quot;, the 2008 film dramatizing Pedro Zamora&#x27;s life, Winick is portrayed by Hale Appleman. Winick and his wife Pam Ling can be seen in a cameo in a scene where Jenn Liu and Alex Loynaz, as Ling and Zamora, are meeting on a staircase.

Winick is mentioned in Dave Eggers&#x27; &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;.

==Personal life==
After appearing on &quot;The Real World&quot;, Winick and his former costar, Pam Ling, began to date. Winick proposed to her with a cartoon he made for the occasion, and which he presented to her while wearing a gorilla suit. The cartoon presented Ling with two choices to answer his proposal. After she accepted his proposal, he summoned three singing Elvises. Winick and Ling married in a civil ceremony on August 26, 2001. Writer Armistead Maupin spoke at their ceremony. It marked the first time two cast members of &quot;The Real World&quot; married. As of September 2000, they lived in San Francisco&#x27;s Upper Haight. As of 2024, they have two children, a son and a daughter, whom they work to keep out of the spotlight, preferring to omit photos of them from social media, and mention of their names in interviews.

<text>The Treaty of Córdoba established Mexican independence from Spain at the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence. It was signed on August 24, 1821 in Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico. The signatories were the head of the Army of the Three Guarantees, Agustín de Iturbide, and, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, &quot;Jefe Político Superior&quot; Juan O&#x27;Donojú. The treaty has 17 articles, which developed the proposals of the Plan of Iguala. The Treaty is the first document in which Spanish (without authorization) and Mexican officials accept the liberty of what will become the First Mexican Empire, but it is not today recognized as the foundational moment, since these ideas are often attributed to the Grito de Dolores (September 16, 1810). The treaty was rejected by the Spanish government, publishing this determination in Madrid on February 13 and 14, 1822.

==Objectives==
In the treaty, New Spain is recognized as an independent empire, which is defined as &quot;monarchical, constitutional and moderate.&quot; The crown of the Mexican Empire was offered first to Ferdinand VII of Spain. Should he not present himself in Mexico within the time to be determined by the Mexican Cortes (parliament) to take the oath of office, the crown would then be offered in sequence to his brothers, the Infantes Carlos and Francisco, and cousin, Archduke Charles or another individual of a royal house, whom the Cortes would determine. In the case that none of these accept the crown, the treaty then established that Cortes could designate a new king without specifying if the person needed to belong to a European royal house.

The idea in this last clause had not been considered in the Plan of Iguala, and was added by Iturbide to leave open the possibility of his taking the crown. At the same time, O&#x27;Donojú, as captain general and &quot;jefe político superior&quot;, had no authority to sign such a treaty, but was interested in preserving Mexico for the Spanish royal family, and probably signed without considering that Iturbide might have designs on the crown.

==Signing and consequences==
On September 27, 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered triumphantly into Mexico City and on the following day, the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire was widely known. Shortly after, Iturbide suggested to offer the Mexican throne to a member of the House of Bourbon (most likely to Ferdinand VII) but all attempts and offers had failed. Therefore, the Mexican Congress elected a Mexican monarch the following year. Iturbide was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on May 18, 1822. The monarchy lasted three years, and after the republican revolution of Casa Mata, the Congress no longer considered the Plan of Iguala or Treaty of Córdoba in effect.

<text>John Rhodes Cobb (2 December 1899 – 29 September 1952) was an early to mid 20th century English racing motorist. He was three times holder of the World Land Speed Record, in 1938, 1939 and 1947, set at Bonneville Speedway in Utah, US. He was awarded the Segrave Trophy in 1947. He was killed in 1952 whilst piloting a jet powered speedboat attempting to break the World Water Speed Record on Loch Ness water in Scotland.

==Early life==
Cobb was born in Esher, Surrey, on 2 December 1899, near the Brooklands motor racing track which he frequented as a boy. He was the son of Florence and Rhodes Cobb, a wealthy furs broker in the City of London. He received his formal education at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, before joining his father&#x27;s firm and pursuing a successful career as the managing director of a number of companies in the trade, the personal financial resources from which he used to fund a passion for large capacity motor high speed racing. In 1924 he acquired a Royal Aero Club aviator&#x27;s certificate, qualifying as a pilot in the Sopwith Grasshopper.

==Racing and speed records career==
Cobb won his first track race in a 1911 10-litre Fiat in 1925, and raced in the Higham Special at Brooklands race track in 1926.

In 1928 he privately purchased a 10.5-litre &quot;Delage&quot; which was imported to England from the factory in Paris, which he raced at Brooklands from 1929 to 1933, breaking the flying start outer lap Record three times in these years, and being clocked at a top speed of 138.88 miles per hour on 2 July 1932. In 1932 he also won the British Empire Trophy at Brooklands.

In 1933 he privately commissioned the design and construction of the 24-litre &quot;Napier Railton&quot; from &quot;Thomson &amp; Taylor&quot;, with which he broke a number of track speed records, including setting the ultimate lap record at the Brooklands race track which was never surpassed, driving at an average speed of achieved on 7 October 1935, having earlier overtaken the 1931 record set by Sir Henry &quot;Tim&quot; Birkin driving Bentley Blower No.1, and regaining it from his friend Oliver Bertram. In the 1934 RAC Tourist Trophy race on the Ards Circuit near Belfast the Lagondas of Cobb and the Hon Brian Lewis competed in the class for larger sports cars against Eddie Hall in a Bentley.
Driving the piston-engined, wheel-driven Railton Special, he broke the World Land Speed Record at Bonneville salt flats on 15 September 1938 by achieving 350 miles per hour. He broke it a second time at the same site on 23 August 1939, achieving 369 miles per hour.

==War service==
During World War II, he served as an officer in the Royal Air Force, and between 1943 and 1945 served with the Air Transport Auxiliary, being demobilised with the rank of Squadron Leader. He made an (uncredited) appearance in the wartime propaganda film &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; (1941).

==Post-war speed record career and death==
Cobb returned to Bonneville salt flats again in 1947, where on 16 September he beat his own standing 1939 World Land Speed Record by reaching (on one of the two runs he was clocked at having reached ), earning him the press moniker 
&quot;The Fastest Man Alive&quot;. This record remained in place until 1963, when it was surpassed by the American Craig Breedlove.
After the 1947 achievement, Cobb turned his mind to becoming on water what he now was on land and went after the simultaneous World Water Speed Record. He commissioned from &quot;Vospers&quot; the jet-engine powered speedboat &quot;Crusader&quot; and selected the long water loch of Loch Ness in Scotland for the speed trial. On 29 September 1952 he was killed at the age of 52 whilst attempting to break the world Water Speed Record at Loch Ness whilst piloting &quot;Crusader&quot; at a speed in excess of . During the run the boat lost stability and disintegrated about Cobb. After extensively studying footage of the crash, Reid Railton, the designer of the boat, concluded the crash was caused by an undamped oscillation which caused a loss of control authority. Cobb&#x27;s body, which had been thrown beyond the wreckage, was recovered from the loch, and subsequently conveyed back to his home county of Surrey, where it was buried in the graveyard of Christ Church, Esher. A memorial was subsequently erected on the Loch Ness shore to his memory by the townsfolk of Glenurquhart.

In 2002 the remains of the jet engine speedboat &quot;Crusader&quot; were located on the bed of Loch Ness at a depth of and the site was designated as a scheduled monument in 2005. The wreck was filmed by a research team from National Geographic in 2019.

==Personal life==

John Cobb married Elizabeth Mitchell-Smith in 1947. Elizabeth died from Bright&#x27;s Disease 14 months later. In 1950 he married Vera Victoria Henderson (1917–2007).

Cobb&#x27;s parental home was &#x27;The Grove&#x27; in Esher, an 18th-century mansion, which was demolished in the late 20th century for building development. A public green in Esher (located at 51.37933 -0.36472) was named &#x27;Cobb Green&#x27; in tribute to his achievements. In 2013 an archaeological excavation of meadowland at Arran Way at Esher&#x27;s Lower Green uncovered the foundations of The Grove. In 2017 a Blue plaque was unveiled by Richard Noble to Cobb&#x27;s memory at the newly re-built Cranmere Primary School which partially occupies the site of the former Grove House estate.

<text>The College of Sociology (French: &quot;Collège de Sociologie&quot;) was a loosely-knit group of French intellectuals, named after the informal discussion series that they held in Paris between 1937 and 1939, when it was disrupted by the war. Its main objective was to find out signs of the sacred in everyday social life.

==History==
Founding members include some of France&#x27;s most well-known intellectuals of the interwar period, including Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois, Pierre Klossowski, Jules Monnerot, Pierre Libra and Georges Ambrosino. Participants also included Hans Mayer, Jean Paulhan, Jean Wahl, Michel Leiris, Alexandre Kojève and André Masson. Walter Benjamin was invited to give lectures, but these never materialized.

The members of the College were united in their dissatisfaction with surrealism. They believed that surrealism&#x27;s focus on the unconscious privileged the individual over society, and obscured the social dimension of human experience.

In contrast to this, the members of the College focused on &quot;Sacred Sociology, implying the study of all manifestations of social existence where the active presence of the sacred is clear.&quot; The group drew on work in anthropology and sociology which focused on the way that human communities engaged in collective rituals or acts of distribution such as potlatch. It was here, in moments of intense communal experience, rather than the individualistic dreams and reveries of surrealism, that the College of Sociology sought the essence of humanity.

The group met for two years and lectured on many topics, including the structure of the army, the Marquis de Sade, English monarchy, literature, sexuality, Hitler, and Hegel. This focus, and in particular their interest in indigenous cultures, was part of a wider trend towards primitivism of the time.

<text>The Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort is a resort hotel on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii. The resort first opened in 1955, and since has grown to become the largest in the Hilton chain of hotels. It is one of largest hotels in the world and the largest in the US outside of Las Vegas.

== Pre-history ==
Located on the Hawaiian island of O&#x27;ahu. The site was the former village of Kālia, which had many ancient aquaculture fishponds. It was later part of the former Bernice Pauahi Bishop estate (until 1912), and was also the childhood home of Duke Kahanamoku and his many cousins from the Paoa family.

The portion of the Bishop estate nearest the ocean beach was developed around 1900 as a small hotel, named the Old Waikiki; then redeveloped in 1928 as the Niumalu Hotel.

== History ==

=== Hawaiian Village Hotel (1955–1960) ===
The Hawaiian Village Hotel was conceived, constructed and first administered by Henry J. Kaiser, the same industrialist who built the Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam and founded the Kaiser Permanente health system.

In 1954, Kaiser and developer Fritz B. Burns bought the Kalia estate of John Ena Jr. and combined it adjacent properties, including the Niumalu Hotel, to construct the Hawaiian Village, converting the flat to a lagoon. They built thatched-roof cottages with 70 guest rooms, The Tapa Room, gardens and three swimming pools and the hotel opened on September 15, 1955. On May 1, 1956, Western Hotels assumed management of the Hawaiian Village Hotel. In 1957, the modern Ocean Tower and the Geodesic Dome were added.

=== Hilton Hotels and Resorts ===
Conrad Hilton bought half of the resort from Henry J. Kaiser in 1961. Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts assumed management on February 1, 1961, renaming the resort the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It cost $21.5 million USD when it was purchased in 1961, which was considered an unusually high price. Elvis Presley stayed at the hotel soon after while filming &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;. In 1968, the resort&#x27;s iconic Rainbow Tower opened, with the world&#x27;s largest and tallest ceramic tile mosaic on its facade, an image of a rainbow measuring 26 feet wide and 286 feet tall, which required over 16,000 individual tiles. The Tapa Tower was added in 1982, and the original Ocean Tower was gutted and rebuilt in 1987, with the addition of two floors, at which point it was renamed the Ali&#x27;i Tower. The 25-story Kalia Tower was added in 2001.

The hotel might be best known as the location for the popular TV series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, which aired on ABC from 1959 to 1963. (The purchase by Hilton was duly noted by the changed signage in 1961.) However, only second-unit footage was filmed there; the bulk of the series was shot at Warner Bros.&#x27; studio in Burbank.

In 1999, The Hilton Hawaiian Village was used as a taping location for two weeks of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; episodes. It would again be used for taping sessions in 2001.

In 2006, Hilton Hotels received $25 million in settlement of its lawsuit over toxic mold grown in the Hilton Hawaiian Village&#x27;s Kalia Tower. Then, in 2015, the hotel was inducted into Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Today, the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel sits on over of beachfront property, near the Ala Moana Center. It features the largest swimming pool in Waikiki, over twenty-two restaurants, exotic wildlife, and botanical gardens, Duke&#x27;s Lagoon and historical exhibits on loan from the Bishop Museum.

===2024 strike===
On September 24, 2024, 1,800 employees at the hotel would go on strike. As of October 30, 2024, all of these 1,800 Hilton Hawaiian Villege employees remained on strike. On November 4, 2024, the strike ended after the over 1,800 striking workers, all of whom where members of UNITE HERE Local 5, voted to ratify a new labor contract. The striking workers would return to work by November 6, 2024.

== Village plan ==
The main concept of the Hawaiian Village was to provide a complete Hawaiian experience for guests without leaving the resort, meaning guests could potentially stay at the resort the whole duration of their stay and be equipped with restaurants, shops, and more.

In building the Hawaiian Village Hotel, Kaiser developed the &quot;village plan&quot; for his resort. In the village plan, various sections of the development were designed in specific types of motifs indicative of the culture of the hotel&#x27;s surroundings. The various villages in the present-day Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort and Spa surround centerpiece towers: Diamond Head Tower, Ali&#x27;i Tower, Tapa Tower, Rainbow Tower, Lagoon Tower, Kalia Tower, Grand Waikikian and Grand Islander. The newest tower is the Grand Islander, which was opened to the public March 1, 2017.

Kaiser&#x27;s village plan is now used in various layouts of hotels and resorts throughout the world.

== Wildlife ==
The Village Hotel includes a small pond filled with several types of turtles (box and soft-shelled). Other animals that live on the grounds include several types of ducks, lesser flamingos, sacred ibis, black-crowned night herons, koi fish, chameleons, macaws, and parakeets. As of 2014, Hilton Hawaiian Village relocated their 3 remaining South African black-footed penguins to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore.

== Geodesic dome ==
The village was the site one of the earlier geodesic domes constructed in the United States, named the &quot;Kaiser Aluminum Dome&quot;. It was used as a music and entertainment venue.

Wanting an auditorium at the Honolulu village, Henry Kaiser acquired the license to produce geodesic domes following the design work of Buckminster Fuller. An aluminum-skinned dome with a -wide span was manufactured at the company&#x27;s plant in Oakland, California and shipped to Hawaii in 1957. When Kaiser understood that the materials had arrived in Hawaii, he flew from San Francisco to follow the construction — only to discover the building was already complete, having been constructed in only 22 hours.

Many records of the golden age of Exotica, notably most of Arthur Lyman&#x27;s albums, were recorded at the dome, renowned for its acoustics and natural reverberation. It was demolished in 1999 to make room for the Kalia Tower.

<text>The Muntz Car Company was an automobile manufacturer based in the United States.

==History==
The company was established in 1950 in Glendale, California by Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz, a well known local used car dealer and electronics retailer. Muntz was assisted by Frank Kurtis, who had earlier attempted to produce a sports car under the Kurtis Kraft marque (the Kurtis Kraft Sport, which sold just 36 units by 1950).

In 1951, Kurtis sold the license to manufacture the cars to Muntz, who rebadged them as the &quot;Muntz Jet&quot;, extended the body to make it a 4-seater, and exchanged the Ford engine with a larger Cadillac V8. Later, this engine would be replaced with a less expensive Lincoln side-valve V8.

The car, a sports coupe, was first built in Glendale, but manufacture soon moved to a new factory in Evanston, Illinois. It featured its own unique design, with aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top that were manufactured in-house. Other parts (such as the engines) were sourced from other manufacturers. It was capable of 112 mph, a significant achievement for a road car at the time. It was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of &quot;Popular Science&quot; (with a Jaguar and an MG).

The company managed to build and sell only about 400 cars during 1951–1954, and due to the high manufacturing cost, Muntz himself estimated that his company lost about $1,000 on each car; this eventually caused him to close the company.

Muntz Jets today are considered rare and valuable collector pieces.

<text>The 3rd World Championships in Athletics, under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations, were held in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Japan between August 23 and September 1. 1517 athletes from 167 countries participated in the event. Japan hosted again the championship in 2007 in Osaka and Tokyo will host again the event in 2025 in a new venue building at the same place.

The event is best-remembered for the men&#x27;s long jump competition, when Carl Lewis made the best six-jump series in history, only to be beaten by Mike Powell, whose jump broke Bob Beamon&#x27;s long-standing world record from the 1968 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="794909" wikidata="Q6209615" url="?curid=794909" title="Joe Duffy">
<text>Joseph Duffy (born 27 January 1956) is an Irish radio and TV presenter employed by RTÉ. One of the public service broadcaster&#x27;s highest-earning stars, he is the current presenter of &quot;Liveline&quot;, an interview and phone-in chat show broadcast on RTÉ Radio 1 on Mondays to Fridays between 13:45 and 15:00.

Duffy was a student activist and a former president of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI). He is married, is the father of triplets, and resides in Clontarf, Dublin. He won a Jacob&#x27;s Award in 1992.

Duffy is a client of self-styled &quot;agent to the stars&quot; Noel Kelly of NK Management.

==Early life==
Duffy was born on 27 January 1956 in Mountjoy Square, Dublin. He was brought up in Ballyfermot, one of five siblings. His father was Jimmy and his mother Mabel. Jimmy, who had problems with alcohol, died aged 58 in 1984. Joe Duffy&#x27;s brother Aidan was killed in a road accident on the Maynooth Road in 1991 aged 25, with Joe first learning of the &quot;horrific accident&quot; on the news on RTÉ Radio. Joe&#x27;s brother Brendan was described by him as &quot;crippled, ruined and wrecked by a savage addiction&quot; to sniffing glue which he developed as a teenager.

Duffy attended De La Salle Boys&#x27; primary school, St Lorcan&#x27;s B.N.S. and St John&#x27;s De La Salle College. He enrolled at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in 1977 to study Social Work and was elected President of Trinity College Students&#x27; Union in 1979, becoming President of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) four years later. As President of the USI he was once jailed for an occupation in which he had participated.

In 2008, he appeared on the RTÉ television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, where his family history in the British Army in India was revealed.

==Career==
===&quot;Liveline&quot;===
Duffy claims he thought about resigning from RTÉ in 2007 after the broadcaster forced him to give Justice Minister Michael McDowell a platform on &quot;Liveline&quot; to make a &quot;party political broadcast&quot;. Duffy considered it &quot;direct party-political interference&quot; in &quot;Liveline&quot;. However, he went ahead with the broadcast and did not resign or make any protest on air.

In October 2008, he was proactive as a supporter of Irish pensioners who marched on Leinster House (home of the Oireachtas) to protest at the proposed means testing of their medical cards in the Government Budget. However, earlier that month, he was reportedly censored by the government when he attempted to continually discuss the effects of the global financial crisis in Ireland. This followed on from the outrage caused when Duffy was held responsible by Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan, for inciting widespread public fear that Irish citizens were on the verge of losing their savings. Several callers freely spoke of their lack of confidence in the banking system, of how they had withdrawn their money from banks, some of which were identified, and were either carrying it around on their person, or considering keeping it &quot;under the mattress&quot;, or burying it in their garden. Lenihan personally rang Cathal Goan, the Director-General of RTÉ, on 18 September 2008 (the date of the show) to express his outrage at the sudden increase in potentially disastrous speculation following the show.

The extent of The Finance Minister&#x27;s concern first publicly emerged the following morning when he was interviewed by RTÉ&#x27;s economics editor George Lee. In that interview, Lenihan insisted that deposits were not in any danger and said that people should not be going to banks to shift their deposit accounts &quot;on the basis of unfounded allegations made on radio programmes&quot;.

Rival broadcaster TV3 accused RTÉ and Joe Duffy of waging a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; war against them after a late-night game show run by TV3 was berated by callers to &quot;Liveline&quot; and saying several times on air that he had been unable to get a representative from the station to reply to callers&#x27; concerns. TV3 said a lengthy statement was sent to the &quot;Liveline&quot; office almost two hours before the September 2009 show went on air but was ignored, despite the fact that it clarified some of the issues. The &quot;Play TV&quot; service was discontinued by TV3 in March 2010 after 29 complaints to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), though TV3 said it was because of a decline in viewership.

Journalist Kevin Myers wrote in October 2009, &quot;Throw in some mob-oratory from the national broadcaster&#x27;s disgraceful &#x27;Liveline&#x27;, and almost no state institution and no politician is safe from the vengeful, idiot wrath of Madame La Guillotine, or Les Heureuses Tricoteuses.&quot;

===Earnings===
Duffy earned €408,889 in 2008. RTÉ&#x27;s Director General said there was &quot;no question that by today&#x27;s standards&quot; the salaries paid to its top presenters last year &quot;were excessive. I have to repeat that they were set at a different time in a different competitive reality where some of this talent might be up for poaching by other organisations and in RTÉ&#x27;s view at the time, they delivered value for money&quot;.

Listeners, who contacted RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Drivetime&quot; programme were swift to condemn the salary level, saying it was ironic that programmes like &quot;Liveline&quot; – presented by Joe Duffy – were used as a platform for criticising the pay and expenses of Oireachtas members.

Duffy defended his own high wages and those of his fellow RTÉ presenters while appearing on TV3&#x27;s &quot;Midweek&quot; in October 2011, claiming they were agreed “fair and square”. The following month, his 2009 earnings were revealed by RTÉ to have been €389,314. He defended this by saying he considered himself and his &quot;Liveline&quot; show &quot;good value&quot; for RTÉ.

In March 2013, it was revealed he had earned €378,000 in 2011, which increased to €392,494 in 2019.

===Panto===
In 2018–19, Duffy played (in pre-recorded sequences) the Magic Mirror in the Cheerios Panto, Snow White, making use of some of the Liveline catchphrases, such as &quot;Talk to Joe&quot;.

==Lampooning of Joe Duffy on &quot;The Savage Eye&quot;==
Duffy was frequently lampooned at length on the satirical TV programme &quot;The Savage Eye&quot;. It portrays him as a fetish garment clad sado-masochist who derives perverse pleasure by urging his call-in radio listeners in a strong working class Dublin accent, to express excesses of degradation and misery as he &quot;empathises&quot; verbally and plays with his nipple clamps. Duffy has since questioned viewership figures for &quot;The Savage Eye&quot; on his daily radio show and had questioned whether it is &quot;blasphemous&quot; on his Sunday afternoon religious affairs TV show &quot;Spirit Level&quot;.

==Personal life==
Joe Duffy is married and is the father of triplets. He currently resides on Dublin&#x27;s Northside.

He describes himself as a Christian socialist who advocates justice &quot;very much based on Christian teaching and principles&quot;. Duffy retraced his Christian roots in 2010 by hosting an RTÉ One TV show called &quot;Joe Duffy&#x27;s Spirit Level&quot; which discussed the great faith of the Irish people and various religions present in the country, and also queried whether David McSavage&#x27;s satirical portrayal of Duffy could be considered blasphemous.

His autobiography &quot;Just Joe&quot; was launched by Gay Byrne in Harry&#x27;s Bar in October 2011. 
In 2014, Duffy made a cameo in &quot;Mrs. Brown&#x27;s Boys D&#x27;Movie&quot; as himself. The film was negatively received but was a moderate box office success.

In August 2022, Joe described on his radio programme his terrifying recent encounter with a weever on a Dublin beach, leading to &#x27;excruciating pain&#x27; which necessitates him wearing swim boots at all times.

==Awards==
In 1992, Duffy won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for his reports on RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot;.

Duffy was named 11th most influential person of 2009 by &quot;Village&quot;.

<doc id="794911" wikidata="Q979129" url="?curid=794911" title="Central hypoventilation syndrome">
<text>Central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that causes ineffective breathing, apnea, or respiratory arrest during sleep (and during wakefulness in severe cases). CHS can either be congenital (CCHS) or acquired (ACHS) later in life. The condition can be fatal if untreated. CCHS was once known as Ondine&#x27;s curse.
ACHS can develop as a result of severe injury or trauma to the brain or brainstem. Congenital cases are very rare and involve a failure of autonomic control of breathing. In 2006, there were only about 200 known cases worldwide. As of 2008, only 1000 total cases were known. The diagnosis may be delayed because of variations in the severity of the manifestations or lack of awareness in the medical community, particularly in milder cases. However, as there have been cases where asymptomatic family members also were found to have CCHS, it may be that these figures only reflect those found to require mechanical ventilation. In all cases, episodes of apnea occur in sleep, but in a few patients, at the most severe end of the spectrum, apnea also occurs while awake.

Although rare, cases of long-term untreated CCHS have been reported and are termed late onset CCHS (LO-CCHS). There have, however, even been cases of LO-CCHS where family members found to have it have been asymptomatic. Again, lack of awareness in the medical community may cause such a delay. CCHS susceptibility is not known to be affected by sex or race.

==Signs and symptoms==
CHS is associated with respiratory arrests during sleep and, in some cases, to neuroblastoma (tumors of the sympathetic ganglia), Hirschsprung disease (partial agenesis of the enteric nervous system), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and anomalies of the pupilla. Other symptoms include darkening of skin color from inadequate amounts of oxygen, drowsiness, fatigue, headaches, and an inability to sleep at night. Patients with CHS also have a sensitivity to sedatives and narcotics, which makes respiration even more difficult. A low concentration of oxygen in the red blood cells also may cause hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension, culminating in cor pulmonale or a failure of the right side of the heart. Associated complications may also include gastro-esophageal reflux, ophthalmologic issues, seizures, recurrent pneumonia, developmental delays, learning disabilities, episodes of fainting, and temperature disregulation.

==Causes==
CHS is exhibited typically as a congenital disorder, but in rare circumstances, can also result from severe brain or spinal trauma or injury (such as after an automobile accident, stroke, asphyxiation, brain tumor, encephalitis, poisoning, as a complication of neurosurgery) or due to particular neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, multiple system atrophy, or multiple sclerosis. Long and Allen (1984) were the first to report the abnormal brainstem auditory-evoked responses in an alcoholic woman who recovered from Ondine&#x27;s curse. These investigators hypothesized that their patient&#x27;s brainstem was poisoned—not destroyed—by her chronic alcoholism.

Medical investigation of patients with this syndrome has led to a deeper understanding of how the body and brain regulate breathing on a molecular level. PHOX2B, a transcription factor involved in the development of neurons, can be associated with this condition. This homeobox gene is important for the normal development of the autonomic nervous system.

The disease used to be classified as a &quot;neurocristopathy&quot;, or disease of the neural crest because part of the autonomic nervous system (such as sympathetic ganglia) derives from the neural crest. However, this denomination is no longer favored because essential neurons of the autonomic nervous system, including those that underlie the defining symptom of the disease (respiratory arrests), are derived from the neural tube (the medulla), not from the neural crest, which may be the case in other mixed embryological origins and neurocristopathies.

==Diagnosis==
Children with CCHS develop life-threatening episodes of apnea with cyanosis, usually in the first months of life. Medical evaluation excludes lesions of the brain, heart, and lungs but demonstrates impaired responses to build-up of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and decreases of oxygen in the circulation (hypoxia), the two strongest stimuli to increase breathing rate.

Polysomnography shows that hypoventilation is most marked during slow-wave sleep. Specifically, infants with CCHS usually display lower tidal volumes during sleep, meaning they inhale less air during a normal breath. In the most severe cases, hypoventilation is present during other nonrapid eye movement sleep stages and even wakefulness. A subset of CCHS patients are at very high risk for developing malignant neural crest-derived tumors, such as neuroblastoma.

Sequencing of the gene PHOX2B revealed mutations in 91% of the cases within a French cohort.

Physicians unable to recognize the disorder should seek help from a neurologist and a pulmonologist. In some locations, such as France, optimal management of patients, once identified, has been aided by the creation of a national registry and the formation of a network of centers.

==Treatment==
People generally require tracheostomy and lifetime mechanical ventilation on a ventilator in order to survive. However, it has now been shown that biphasic cuirass ventilation can effectively be used without the need for a tracheotomy. Other potential treatments for CCHS include oxygen therapy and medicine for stimulating the respiratory system. Currently, problems arise with the extended use of ventilators, including fatal infections and pneumonia.

There are two primary organisations focused on delivering new treatments for CCHS. These are Keep Me Breathing, a UK based research charity which focuses solely on CCHS and The CCHS Network, a US based research charity which focuses the vast majority of its funding on CCHS scientific research.

==Prognosis==
Most people with CCHS (unless they have the Late Onset form) do not survive infancy, unless they receive ventilatory assistance during sleep. An alternative to a mechanical ventilator is diaphragm pacing.

==History==
CCHS was first described in 1962 by Severinghaus and Mitchell in three patients following surgery to the upper cervical spinal cord and brainstem.

==Etymology==
Its name is a reference to the story of Ondine and Hans, characters in &quot;Ondine&quot;, a 1938 play by Jean Giraudoux based on traditions tracing back through &quot;Undine&quot; (a novella of 1811) to earlier European folk tales. The water-spirit Ondine tells her future husband Hans, whom she had just met, that &quot;I shall be the shoes of your feet ... I shall be the breath of your lungs&quot;. Ondine reluctantly makes a pact with her uncle the King of the Ondines that if Hans ever deceives her he will die. After their honeymoon, Hans is reunited with his first love Princess Bertha. Ondine leaves Hans in an attempt to protect him, but she is recaptured by a fisherman and Hans is stricken by the King&#x27;s curse. On meeting Ondine again, Hans tells her that &quot;all the things my body once did by itself, it does now only by special order ... A single moment of inattention and I forget to breathe&quot;. Hans and Ondine kiss, after which he dies.

Since being coined in 1962 the name has become controversial in medical literature, as later summaries frequently misunderstood the plot of &quot;Ondine&quot; and its connection to the diagnosis. Most frequently, Ondine was inaccurately blamed for cursing Hans, but other mistakes sometimes changed the nature of the curse itself. Such errors led to confusion in defining the medical condition.

<doc id="794913" wikidata="Q60467" url="?curid=794913" title="Hideo Itokawa">
<text>was a pioneer of Japanese rocketry, popularly known as &quot;Dr. Rocket,&quot; and described in the media as the father of Japan&#x27;s space development.

The near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa was named in honor of Itokawa, and is notable as the target of the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission. 

==Biography==
Born in Tokyo, Itokawa skipped grades in school and graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University (University of Tokyo) in 1935, having majored in aeronautical engineering. In 1941, he became an assistant professor at the university. During World War II, he was involved in designing aircraft at the Nakajima Aircraft Company and designed the Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Hayabusa&quot; (&quot;peregrine falcon&quot;; Allied reporting name &quot;Oscar&quot;) fighter. 

Itokawa became a full professor at his alma mater in 1948. In 1955, Itokawa worked on the Pencil Rocket for Japan&#x27;s space program. He retired from his post at the university in 1967 and established an institute.

On 11 February 1970, a team formerly led by him at the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science at the University of Tokyo succeeded in launching Japan&#x27;s first satellite, Ohsumi, making the country the fourth nation in the world to have the capability to send objects into orbit with their own launch vehicles. The satellite was carried on a Lambda 4S rocket, a joint project by the Institute of Industrial Science at the university and Nissan.

Itokawa wrote 49 books, and was a best-selling author. Topics that Itokawa became interested in or took as a hobby, include such sports as basketball, golf and swimming, as well as orchestral arrangements and such instruments as cello, harmonica, organ, piano, violin and taishōgoto (a string instrument invented in Japan). He was also interested in baton twirling, brain waves, English language plays, Mah Jong, philosophy, rocket engineering and novel writing.

<text>IPIX was an imaging technology company headquartered in Cohoes, New York. It supplies hardware and software for producing, publishing, embellishing, and collaborating with spherical imagery.

== History ==
IPIX Corporation, successor-in-interest to Internet Pictures Corporation, Bamboo.com Inc., Omniview Inc., and TeleRobotics International, was originally an imaging technology company headquartered in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. One of its products was visual technology allowing the stitching of panoramic images into 360°x 180° field of view video and photography. The company&#x27;s stock was traded on NASDAQ (IPIXQ).

Their .ipx format was for a time a widely used virtual image type for hotel and real estate websites. &#x27;IPIX Interactive Studio&#x27;, could create IPIX&#x27;s proprietary format, QuickTime Cubic VR images, Equirectangular and Cylindrical Projections as JPEGs that could be viewed with Helmut Dersch&#x27;s freeware Java PTViewer, Shockwave w3d files, VRML files and X3D files. Two plug-ins are available that can create images in the RealViz format and iSeeMedia&#x27;s PhotoVista format.

IPIX licensing method was as follows. The proprietary IPIX software &quot;IPIX Wizard&quot; could seam any number of fisheyes (or retouched fisheyes) into a .ipx and would only allow viewing of the image for quality control purposes. Users wanting to save the .ipx file would &quot;spend&quot; an IPIX key. These keys could be purchased from the IPIX store for $25 each, or less if purchased in bulk. Resellers could purchase these keys and offer IPIX services while charging more than $25 per sold .ipx picture. Minds-Eye-View (&quot;MEV&quot;), the company that bought what remained of IPIX continued this licensing method and continues to use the IPIX name.

IPIX patented its &quot;Omniview motionless camera orientation system&quot;, and has claimed that this patent covered techniques for creating 360-degree images using two fish-eye photographs. It pursued an active policy of filing patent lawsuits against any company or individual that developed similar technologies, Helmut Dersch and the company Infinite Pictures being the most notable examples. The company also filed lawsuits against photographers using software it considered to be infringing its patents. The company was widely criticized for these lawsuits. Among the arguments against the patent claims were the existence of prior art, and that these lawsuits have acted to put a damper on the development of interactive immersive image technologies. It was also argued that some of their claims are too broad, suggesting that any geometric remapping of a fisheye image is their invention. In the end it turned out that IPIX itself was in violation of a prior patent held by Pictosphere, and in court attempted to use the same defense that had been used against them in the past. They lost the suit.

On July 31, 2006, IPIX filed for bankruptcy after posting a 3.8 million dollar loss for the first part of 2006. They had posted a $347 million loss in the tech crash in 2001.

Before going bankrupt IPIX had finished developing a technology called i-movies or vPix, streaming video in 360 degrees again without moving cameras. The technology could allow an infinite number of viewers to &quot;move&quot; their own camera and viewing space in a live televised event. The technology was not further marketed.

On January 19, 2007, it auctioned off a block of 28 patents for $3.6 million, to an anonymous bidder which later revealed itself to be Sony.

On March 27, 2007 Minds-Eye-View won the auction for the remaining IPIX assets, including the trademark name, software and websites. Quotes by Minds-Eye-View president Ford Oxaal suggest the IPIX brand and products will continue to be available.

<text>Mystery Writers of America (MWA) is a professional organization of mystery and crime writers, based in New York City.

The organization was founded in 1945 by Clayton Rawson, Anthony Boucher, Lawrence Treat, and Brett Halliday.

It presents the Edgar Award, a small bust of Edgar Allan Poe, to mystery or crime writers every year. It presents the Raven Award to non-writers who contribute to the mystery genre. The category of Best Juvenile Mystery is also part of the Edgar Award, with such notable recipients as Barbara Brooks Wallace having won the honor twice for &quot;The Twin in the Tavern&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Sparrows in the Scullery&quot; in 1998, and Tony Abbott for his novel &quot;The Postcard&quot; in 2009.

John Dickson Carr, who also served as president of the MWA, won a Grand Master Award in 1949 and 1962.

==Grand Master Award==
The Grand Master Award is the highest honor bestowed by the Mystery Writers of America. It recognizes lifetime achievement and consistent quality. (The award was presented irregularly up to 1978; from 1979 to 2008, it was given to one writer each year. Since 2009, as many as three authors have been honored annually.)

In 2018, the Mystery Writers of America announced that it would honor best-selling author and former prosecutor Linda Fairstein with one of its Grand Master Awards for literary achievement. But two days after controversy erupted in connection with her alleged role in the Central Park jogger case, the organization withdrew the honor.

==Raven Award==

The Raven Awards are recorded in the Edgars Database of the Mystery Writers of America.

<text>Kołbacz () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Stare Czarnowo, within Gryfino County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-western Poland. It lies approximately north-east of Stare Czarnowo, east of Gryfino, and south-east of the regional capital Szczecin. It is located on the Pyrzyce-Stargard Plains, on the west bank of the river Płonia, and has roughly 1,400 inhabitants.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since at least the times of the Lusatian culture. The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I around 967. Following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation, it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1173 it was donated to the Cistercian order (originally of Esrum, Denmark). Between 1210 and 1347 a large monastery (Kołbacz Abbey) and several farms were built in the area to house the monks. In sources known as &quot;Colbatz&quot;, &quot;Kolbatz&quot;, &quot;Colbas&quot;, sometimes &quot;Mera Vallis&quot; which means &quot;Bright Valley&quot;. After the secularization of Pomeranian Cistercians in 1555 the area became a private property of the Dukes of Pomerania-Stettin (Szczecin) from the House of Griffin, the monastery was converted into a castle and then into a summer residence of the dukes. After the dissolution of the duchy, the rulings of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653) assigned the settlement to the Margraviate of Brandenburg. From the 18th century it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. Since 1815 it was administratively located in the Province of Pomerania. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II in 1945, the area became again part of Poland.

==Sights==
Among the most notable historical attractions are remnants of Cistercian abbey, which include a Romanesque-Gothic church (1210–1347), one of the oldest brick churches in Pomerania. There are also remnants of the monastery itself, as well as a converts&#x27; house, abbot&#x27;s house, a gothic barn and a fortified tower. The abbey is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland.

<text>The Riigikogu (, from Estonian &quot;riigi-&quot;, &quot;of the state&quot;, and &quot;kogu&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;) is the unicameral parliament of Estonia. In addition to approving legislation, the Parliament appoints high officials, including the prime minister and chief justice of the Supreme Court, and elects (either alone or, if necessary, together with representatives of local government within a broader electoral college) the president. Among its other tasks, the Riigikogu also ratifies significant foreign treaties that impose military and proprietary obligations and bring about changes in law, as well as approves the budget presented by the government as law, and monitors the executive power.

==History==
===History===
23 April 1919, the opening session of the Estonian Constituent Assembly is considered the founding date of the Parliament of Estonia. Established under the 1920 constitution, the Riigikogu had 100 members elected for a three-year term on the basis of proportional representation. Elections were fixed for the first Sunday in May of the third year of parliament. The first elections to the Riigikogu took place in 1920. From 1923 to 1932, there were four more elections to the Riigikogu. The elections were on a regional basis, without any threshold in the first two elections, but from 1926 a moderate threshold (2%) was used. The sessions of the Riigikogu take place in the Toompea Castle, where a new building in an unusual Expressionist style was erected in the former courtyard of the medieval castle in 1920–1922.

In 1933 amendments to the first Constitution were approved by referendum, where more power was given to an executive President. The following year, the President used these new powers to adjourn parliament and declared martial law to avert an alleged coup. In 1937, a second constitution was approved by referendum which saw the introduction of a two chambered legislature, the (&quot;Riigivolikogu&quot;) and the National Council (&quot;Riiginõukogu&quot;). Elections were subsequently held in 1938 where only individual candidates were allowed to run.

During the subsequent periods of Soviet occupation (1940–41), German occupation (1941–44), and the second Soviet occupation (1944–1991) the Parliament was disbanded. The premises of the &quot;Riigikogu&quot; were used by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR during the second Soviet occupation.

===Restitution of independence===
In September 1992, a year after Estonia had regained its independence from the Soviet Union, elections to the Parliament took place on the basis of the third Constitution of Estonia adopted in a referendum in the summer of the same year. The 1992 constitution, which incorporates elements of the 1920 and 1938 Constitutions and explicitly asserts its continuity with the Estonian state as it existed between 1918 and 1940, sees the return of a unicameral parliament with 101 members. The most recent parliamentary elections were held on 5 March 2023. The main differences between the current system and a pure political representation, or proportional representation, system are the established 5% national threshold, and the use of a modified D&#x27;Hondt formula (the divisor is raised to the power 0.9). This modification makes for more disproportionality than does the usual form of the formula.

The seat allocation refers to &quot;de facto&quot; allocation, as defectors from fractions are not allowed to join other ones between elections.

<text>Du Pont Motors was founded by E. Paul du Pont to produce marine engines for the Allied nations during World War I. After the war, Du Pont Motors produced extremely high-end automobiles. The cars were manufactured in Wilmington, Delaware.

E. Paul du Pont&#x27;s resources allowed him to hire top-quality automotive and management talent. The company&#x27;s first product, the Model A, was introduced at the 1919 International Salon at the Commodore Hotel in New York City (an event for the wealthy by invitation only, along with the finest manufacturers and coach builders). The Model G was introduced in 1928, with a 5.3 liter side-valve straight eight engine of .

Between 1919 and 1931, the company produced approximately 625 automobiles. They were compared to such luxury cars as Packard, Cadillac and even Stutz, and Duesenberg, and were known for their quality and style. Customers included Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Will Rogers, and Jack Dempsey.

The company went bankrupt in 1932 and merged into the Indian Motorcycle Company when E. Paul du Pont purchased the latter company.

==Du Pont model G==
The Du Pont Model G was the first 8 cylinder model from Du Pont Motors in Wilmington, Delaware.

The car was powered by a Continental 12-K side-valve straight eight cylinder engine with a displacement of 321.8 c.i. (5.3 litre), delivering 125 bhp. Du Pont added an aluminum cover over the distributor, spark plugs and wiring for water and dust protection. There was a 3 speed transmission. Included were four-wheel hydraulic brakes, and hydraulic shock absorbers. Standard wheelbase was 136 in., with 141 in. available for formal coachwork, and a speedster with 125 in. There were 12 factory body styles to choose from, manufactured for Du Pont by Merrimac, Derham, and Waterhouse. The rolling chassis was available for other coachbuilders. Prices ranged from US$4,360 ($ in dollars ) to US$5,750 ($ in dollars ), with Speedsters up to US$6,125 ($ in dollars ).

A 1930 Du Pont Model G Merrimac Town Car won the Best of Show award in the 1958 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance. 

==Du Pont model H==
The Du Pont Model H was the last motor car line for Du Pont Motors. In 1930 the Model H was introduced, which was basically a Model G but with a longer wheelbase that measured 146-inches. A total of three were built consisting of a two car and two sport models. The sports chassis were later bodied as a sport phaeton and a closed-coupled sedan by Dietrich. The other received a formal Berline body and a flat radiator.

<text>A beth din (, , beis din, plural: batei din) is a rabbinical court of Judaism. In ancient times, it was the building block of the legal system. Today, it is invested with legal powers in a number of religious matters (din Torah, &quot;matter of litigation&quot;, plural dinei Torah) both in Israel and in Jewish communities in the diaspora, where its judgments hold varying degrees of authority (depending upon the jurisdiction and subject matter) in matters specifically related to Jewish religious life.

== History ==
Rabbinical commentators point out that the first suggestion in the Torah that the ruler divest his legal powers and delegate his power of judgment to lower courts was made by Jethro to Moses (Exodus ). This situation was formalised later when God gave the explicit command to &quot;establish judges and officers in your gates&quot; (Deuteronomy ).

There were three types of courts (Mishnah, tractate &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 1:1-4 and 1:6):
* The Sanhedrin, the grand central court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, numbering 71
*Smaller courts of 23, called a &quot;Sanhedrin Ketana&quot; (&quot;small Sanhedrin&quot;). These courts could pass the death verdict. These existed on two levels, the one higher in standing than the other:
**The main cities of the tribes, had a court of 23
**All towns of a minimum size (either 120 or 230 people) had to have a court of 23, which was under the jurisdiction of the tribal court
*The smallest court of three was found in villages with a population of fewer than 120 people. Any smaller court (including a court of three laymen) could not pass binding verdicts, and only dealt with monetary matters.

Participation in these courts required the classical &quot;semikhah&quot; (rabbinic ordination), the transmission of judicial authority in an unbroken line down from Moses. Since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, or at the latest the abolition of the position of Nasi in 425 CE, the transmission of &quot;semikhah&quot; has been suspended. Attempts in the 16th century to reinstate the &quot;semikhah&quot; were unsuccessful; Rabbi Yosef Karo was one of the recipients of this &quot;semikhah&quot;.

The Mishnah and Talmud distinguish between ritual or criminal matters and monetary matters (&quot;issurim&quot; and &quot;mamonoth&quot;), and impose different regulations for them, with criminal cases generally having much more stringent limitations. Courts ruled in both kinds of cases. Any question that could not be resolved by a smaller court was passed up to a higher court. If the Sanhedrin was still uncertain, divine opinion was sought through the &quot;Urim ve-Tumim&quot; (the parchment in the High Priest&#x27;s breastplate, which was inscribed with the Name of God and could give supernatural clues).

Given the suspension of &quot;semikhah&quot;, any beth din existing in medieval or modern times is in theory a court of laymen, acting as arbitrators. In practice, they are given greater powers than this by the local &quot;takkanot ha-kahal&quot; (community regulations), and are generally composed of experienced rabbis. Modern training institutes, especially in Israel, confer a qualification of &quot;dayan&quot; (religious judge), which is superior to the normal rabbinical qualification.

== Present day ==
In Orthodox Judaism, the traditions state that a &quot;beth din&quot; consists of three observant Jewish men, at least one of whom is widely knowledgeable in &quot;halakha&quot;, to be capable of instructing the other members in any matters of &quot;halakha&quot; relevant to the case being heard. The rabbis on the &quot;beth din&quot; do not have to be expert in all aspects of Jewish law, rather only the area in question. For example, a &quot;beth din&quot; for conversion need only have expertise in conversion, not necessarily in all areas of Jewish law. There are also a number of opinions that permit women to serve on a &quot;beth din&quot;. One such opinion is Rabbi Ben Zion Uziel. Despite this, there are no Orthodox &quot;batei din&quot; currently with a woman as a member.

In progressive communities, as well as in other non-Orthodox streams of Judaism, women do serve on the &quot;beth din&quot;.

In practice, a permanent &quot;beth din&quot; will consist of three rabbis, while a &quot;beth din&quot; for an occasional matter (such as handling religious vows) need not consist of rabbis. A &quot;beth din&quot; which handles cases involving complex monetary issues or large community organizations requires &quot;judges&quot; (&quot;dayanim&quot;, singular: &quot;dayan&quot;), who require an additional &quot;semikhah&quot; (&quot;yadin yadin&quot;) which enables them to participate in such a &quot;beth din&quot; and adjudicate complex cases involving highly technical points of law.

A &quot;beth din&quot; is only required for conversions and &quot;gittin&quot; (divorce documents), although lay people are permitted to sit on the &quot;beth din&quot; for conversions.

In addition to this there are &quot;batei din&quot; around the world who supervise the following matters:
*&quot;Kosher&quot; certification of restaurants and food manufacturers (&quot;Hechsher&quot;).
* Examination of shochetim and the control of the shechita inspectors
* Supervising the building and maintenance of a &quot;mikvah&quot;.
* Determination of &quot;personal status&quot; (i. e., whether someone is a Jew according to &quot;halakha&quot;).
* The authorization and supervision of mohelim.
* Questions relating to burial practices and mourning.

A &quot;beth din&quot; is sometimes used within the Orthodox Jewish community to resolve civil disputes, with the Shulkhan Arukh calling for civil cases being resolved by religious, instead of secular, courts (&quot;arka&#x27;oth&quot;). Modern Western societies increasingly permit civil disputes to be resolved by private arbitration, enabling religious Jews to enter into agreements providing for arbitration by a particular &quot;beth din&quot; in the event of a dispute. By this device, the rules, procedures, and judgement of the &quot;beth din&quot; are accepted and can be enforced by secular courts in the same manner as those of a secular arbitration association. For example, in a 2018 decision, the Court of Appeal in Ontario, Canada, enforced an arbitration decision by the New York rabbinical court tribunal Beth Din (or Bais Din) of Mechon L&#x27;Hoyroa, in Brooklyn. However, the decisions of religious courts cannot be binding without the prior agreement of both parties, and will otherwise act only as mediation. 

== Officers of a &quot;beth din&quot; ==
A &quot;beth din&quot; may have the following officers:

*Av Beth Din (, literally &quot;Chief of the Court&quot;, abbreviated / ABD) is the most senior jurist who may join in the adjudication of cases or advise the presiding &quot;dayanim&quot;. The &quot;av beth din&quot; will usually be a highly respected &quot;rabbi&quot; and &quot;posek&quot;, who can give responsa. Traditionally, the salaried rabbi of the local Jewish community served as the &quot;av beth din&quot;.
*Rosh Beth Din (, literally &quot;Head of the Court&quot;, abbreviated ) is equivalent to a chief justice. He will be the senior member of a three-judge panel. In smaller communities, the &quot;av beth din&quot; also serves as the &quot;rosh&quot;.
*A Dayan (, rabbinic judge, plural: dayanim) sits and adjudicates cases. A rabbinic judge may directly question and cross-examine witnesses. The &quot;Dayan&quot; holds a specialized ordination titled &quot;Yadin Yadin&quot;.

<text>A longbox is a form of exterior paperboard packaging for musical compact discs in widespread use in the 1980s and early 1990s in North America.

== Background ==
When compact discs first began to appear in the retail stores, the longbox packaging served a transitional purpose, allowing shops to file new compact discs in the same bins originally used for vinyl records. Longboxes were tall (the same length as the standard 33⅓ LP), and capable of containing two separate discs when necessary. Most longboxes were full color, with details about the compact disc on the back, and artwork that was frequently taken from the original square album cover art, reworked for the new shape and size. There were generic white longboxes with windows that would display the compact disc cover, as well as clear plastic versions that were an inexpensive substitute for a printed longbox.

Placing the jewelcase within a cardboard enclosure made for a larger and more cumbersome package that would be more difficult to shoplift from retailers.

Longboxes began to fade from popularity as the CDs themselves became more colorful, elaborate, and customized (labels initially printed CDs with standardized, oftentimes black-on-silver labels simply listing basic information about a release and its contents). Longboxes were also considered environmentally wasteful and were expensive to produce. In North America, the drive to eliminate longboxes took hold in Canada first.

== Legacy ==
Environmental concerns of unnecessary cardboard waste from artists and consumers alike created controversy over continued use of longboxes. For instance, David Byrne included a sticker over the packaging of his album &quot;Uh-Oh&quot; reading &quot;THIS IS GARBAGE&quot;, referring to the excessive material use of the packaging and encouraged customers to complain to retailers, while musicians such as Raffi and Peter Gabriel simply refused to have their material packaged with a longbox. In 1990, the Earth Communications Office, a coalition formed within the US entertainment industry focused on the environment, launched a movement called “Ban the Box” in an effort to eliminate longboxes. The satirical band Spinal Tap&#x27;s 1992 studio album &quot;Break Like the Wind&quot; was sold in an &quot;extra-long box&quot; (an longbox).

On the other hand, some recording executives tried to have the packaging serve a useful purpose beyond marketing such as when in 1991 Warner Music executive Jeff Gold approached the band R.E.M. about a political initiative. The band agreed to have the longbox to their album &quot;Out of Time&quot; carry printing where customers were encouraged to sign their name on the longbox as part of a petition in support of the Motor Voter Bill to ease voter registration. As a result, the participating activist group Rock the Vote received 10,000 signed longboxes and presented them to the US Congress in support of the bill, which was voted into law, although Presidential approval had to wait until the Bill Clinton administration.

Some merchants resisted this disapproval of the packaging, as longboxes theoretically made it harder for shoplifters to hide the items as well as avoiding friction with retailers. Several proposals for new types of packaging that served the display-size of the longbox and theft-prevention goals were developed. A common replacement consisted of locking plastic frames (security keepers) containing anti-theft detection strips, designed to roughly meet the same dimensions as the longbox to fit into the same racks in a record store, and removed by the cashier upon purchase. Eventually, as LP-sized sales racks were phased out, these frames were reduced to a size only slightly larger than the disc boxes themselves.

Longbox packaging was phased out officially as of April 1, 1993, due to the controversy. At the same time, major retail stores were no longer selling vinyl records and had converted their displays to accommodate shrink-wrapped jewel cases, meeting the rising consumer demand for CDs while eliminating the need for longboxes. A further inducement came when Jeff Gold convinced Warner Music&#x27;s distributors that they could save $25 million by eliminating the expense of using that packaging form and placate retailers by passing on half the savings to them to help ease the conversion to the proper display fixtures.

Aside from the occasional box-set or vanity CD packaging, longbox packaging is largely obsolete. However, longboxes are still occasionally used by warehouse clubs such as Costco for both CD and DVD packaging, though the boxes are typically generic and not produced by the media distributors.

Most original longboxes were discarded upon purchase, and they have since become desirable amongst music collectors. A compact disc is worth more if it is accompanied by its original longbox.

<text>Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda (30 April 1914 – 21 May 1977) was a Brazilian journalist and politician.

==Biography==
Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state. He was the son of the politician, tribune and writer Maurício de Lacerda (1888–1959) and Olga Caminhoá Werneck (1892–1979), being the paternal grandson of Sebastião Lacerda, Minister of the Supreme Federal Court and Minister of Transport in the government of Prudente de Morais. For his maternal family, he was great-grandson of botanist Joaquim Monteiro Caminhoá, great-grandson of the baron of Ribeirão, a direct descendant of Inácio de Sousa Vernek, whose family had important political and economic influence in the region; great-nephew of the baron of Maçambara, of the viscount of Cananeia, of the baron of Avelar e Almeida, of the baroness of Werneck, great-nephew of the baron of Santa Fé and great-nephew of the 1st baron of Santa Justa.

When he was a law student, Lacerda became sympathetic to left-wing ideas, but by the 1940s, he had transformed into a staunch anticommunist and conservative.

He started his journalism career at &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; (English: &quot;Daily News&quot;) in 1929. In 1949 he founded the newspaper &quot;Tribuna da Imprensa&quot; (English: &quot;Press Tribune&quot;)..

Starting his political career in 1947, Lacerda was elected to the legislative chamber (city council) of the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1950, he was elected a National Democratic Union representative for the state of Rio in the Chamber of Deputies. He became well known for his uncompromising opposition of the government of President Getúlio Vargas and even demanded the overthrow of Vargas.

He survived an assassination attempt in the Rua Tonelero shooting in August 1954. It is widely believed by historians to have been made by men acting under the orders of Gregório Fortunato, &quot;O Anjo Negro&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;The Black Angel&quot;), a black man, who was the head of Vargas&#x27; personal bodyguards. Brazilian Air Force Major Rubens Vaz was killed in the attempt, and Lacerda was slightly injured. That sparked a political crisis that culminated with the suicide of Vargas.

Lacerda was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies later in 1954, with more votes than any other candidate. He also opposed the government of President Juscelino Kubitschek.

Lacerda was elected governor of Guanabara State, comprising Rio, in 1960. His administration was praised by the US government and the IMF for his efforts to solve some chronic problems of Rio such as water services, public transportation and housing. As part of this drive, Lacerda ordered areas of the city - often areas targeted by developers - to be cleared of the inhabitants. Over this period, up to 140,000 people were evicted, mostly from the three favelas on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, located near the beaches of the city&#x27;s south zone.

An opinionated and controversial politician, Lacerda was involved in the crisis of the resignation of President Jânio Quadros in 1961 and conspired against the presidency of João Goulart. Hoping to be elected president in the 1965 elections, Lacerda initially supported the military coup d&#x27;état of 1964 and was nominated the UDN candidate. Since the military was not willing to give up power, the 1965 elections were cancelled, and Lacerda definitely fell from the military&#x27;s favor. In 1968, his efforts to restore democracy in Brazil made him ally with his old enemies, Kubitschek and Goulart, and Lacerda was arrested for a brief period and stripped of his right to run for political office for ten years. Then, he retired from politics and resumed his journalism and publishing career. In 1977, he died suddenly in Rio de Janeiro from a heart attack., his wife Leticia died in 1990.

==Popular culture==
Lacerda was portrayed by Alexandre Borges in the 2014 biographical drama film &quot;Getúlio&quot;.

Author Rubem Fonseca treats the assassination attempt on Lacerda (Rua Tonelero shooting) as part of his role in the crises events of Rio de Janeiro during August 1954 in his 1990 novel, &quot;Crimes of August&quot;, (translated from the Brazilian &quot;Agosto&quot; to English in 2014).

His friendship with the architect Lota de Macedo Soares is depicted as a side plot in the 2013 film &quot;Flores Raras&quot; (&quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot;), directed by Bruno Barreto and starring Gloria Pires and Miranda Otto. Actor Marcello Airoldi played Lacerda in this biographical drama about the 15 years relationship of American poet Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares.

He is also mentioned in the book, &quot;Child of the Dark&quot;, The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus.

<text>:&quot;Alternative meaning: Richard Atkinson (educator)&quot;

Richard John Copland Atkinson (22 January 1920 – 10 October 1994) was a British prehistorian and archaeologist.

==Biography==
Atkinson was born in Evershot, Dorset, and went to Sherborne School and then Magdalen College, Oxford, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics. During the Second World War, his Quaker beliefs meant that he was a conscientious objector. In 1944, he became Assistant Keeper of Archaeology at the Ashmolean Museum. In 1949, he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.

Atkinson directed excavations at Stonehenge for the Ministry of Works between 1950 and 1964. During this period he helped to bring theories about the origins and construction of Stonehenge to a wider audience: for example, through the BBC television programme, &quot;Buried Treasure&quot; (1954), which, among other things, sought to demonstrate, using teams of schoolboys, how the stones might have been transported by water or over land. He also produced a theory on the creation of Stonehenge.

He also investigated sites at Silbury Hill, West Kennet Long Barrow, and Wayland&#x27;s Smithy and was a friend and collaborator of Peggy Piggott, Stuart Piggott and John F.S. Stone. His Silbury work was part of a BBC documentary series &quot;Chronicle&quot; on the monument. In 1958, he moved to University College, Cardiff, to become its first professor of archaeology. He remained at Cardiff until he retired in 1983. He served on the University Grants Committee. He received the CBE in 1979. Atkinson worked tirelessly to promote and develop science-based British archaeology, and was famous for his practical contributions to archaeological technique and his pragmatic solutions to on-site problems, which were listed in the handbook he wrote called &quot;Field Archaeology&quot;.

== Legacy ==
English Heritage holds Atkinson&#x27;s collection of over 2,000 record photographs in the public English Heritage Archive. A selection of around 200 photographs can be viewed online on the ViewFinder website. The Wessex Gallery of Archaeology, which opened at the Salisbury Museum in summer 2014, displays Bronze Age artefacts discovered by Atkinson in July 1953.

Unfortunately, because of an extremely heavy administrative burden arising from service on many committees throughout his career, including a period as Deputy Principal of University College, Cardiff, Atkinson&#x27;s written reports of the excavations at Stonehenge were not complete before serious illness, mainly caused by overwork, forced total retirement.

<doc id="794957" wikidata="Q12495" url="?curid=794957" title="Burj Khalifa">
<text>The Burj Khalifa (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and the world&#x27;s tallest structure. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire) of , the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.

Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. 

The building is named after the former president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The United Arab Emirates government provided Dubai with financial support as the developer, Emaar Properties, experienced financial problems during the Great Recession. Then-president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed, organized federal financial support. For his support, Mohammad bin Rashid, Ruler of Dubai, changed the name from &quot;Burj Dubai&quot; to &quot;Burj Khalifa&quot; during inauguration.

The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimise residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. The Burj Khalifa&#x27;s central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai&#x27;s hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.

== Development ==
Construction began on 12 January 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The building officially opened on 4 January 2010 and is part of the Downtown Dubai development at the &#x27;First Interchange&#x27; along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai&#x27;s main business district. 

The tower&#x27;s architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as a chief structural engineer. The firm had designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, a previous record holder for the world&#x27;s tallest building.

Hyder Consulting was supervising engineer and NORR Group Consultants supervised the architecture. The primary contractor was Samsung C&amp;T of South Korea, together with the Belgian group BESIX and the local company Arabtec. 

Numerous complaints concerned migrant workers from South Asia, the primary building labour force, who were paid low wages and sometimes had their passports confiscated.

== Conception ==
Burj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development to include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), of parkland, at least 19 residential skyscrapers, the Dubai Mall, and the artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build Burj Khalifa was reportedly based on the government&#x27;s decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, projects like Burj Khalifa needed to be built to garner more international recognition and hence investment. &quot;He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational,&quot; said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties. 

The tower was known as Burj Dubai (&quot;Dubai Tower&quot;) until its official opening in January 2010. It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of US dollars so that Dubai could pay its debts – Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects. In the 2000s, Dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, leaving large-scale projects already in construction abandoned.

== Records ==
The Burj Khalifa set several world records, including:
* Tallest existing structure: (previously KVLY-TV mast – )
* Tallest structure ever built: (previously Warsaw radio mast – )
* Tallest freestanding structure: (previously CN Tower – )
* Tallest skyscraper (to top of spire): (previously Taipei 101 – )
* Tallest skyscraper to top of antenna: (previously the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower – )
* Building with most floors: 163 (previously World Trade Center – 110)
* World&#x27;s highest elevator installation (situated inside a rod at the very top of the building)
* World&#x27;s longest travel distance elevators: 
* Highest vertical concrete pumping (for a building): 
* World&#x27;s tallest structure that includes residential space
* World&#x27;s highest installation of an aluminium and glass façade: 
* World&#x27;s highest restaurant (&quot;At.mosphere&quot;): 122nd floor at (previously 360, at a height of in CN Tower)
* World&#x27;s highest New Year display of fireworks.
* World&#x27;s largest light and sound show staged on a single building.

== Architecture and design ==

The tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM), which also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City. Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan. Due to its tubular system, proportionally only half the amount of steel was used in the construction, compared to the Empire State Building. Khan&#x27;s contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work. The design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago&#x27;s Lake Point Tower. When Adrian Smith was conceiving the project at SOM, he looked out his office window toward Lake Point Tower&#x27;s curved three-wing layout and thought, &quot;There&#x27;s the prototype&quot;. According to Strabala, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73rd floor Tower Palace Three, an all-residential building in Seoul. In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.

After the original design by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer and NORR Group Consultants International Ltd to supervise the architecture of the project. Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering. Hyder Consulting&#x27;s role was to supervise construction, certify the architect&#x27;s design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities. NORR&#x27;s role was the supervision of all architectural components including on-site supervision during the construction and design of a 6-storey addition to the office annex building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD, an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.

The design is derived from Islamic architecture. As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 setbacks in a spiral pattern, decreasing the cross-section of the tower as it rises and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices. At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire. At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of .
The spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs and has a height of . The spire also houses communications equipment. This spire is widely considered vanity height, since very little of its space is usable. Without the spire, Burj Khalifa would be tall. This was reported in a Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat study, which notes that the empty spire &quot;could be a skyscraper on its own&quot;. Such a skyscraper, if located in Europe, would be the 11th tallest building on that continent.

In 2009 architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of Jaume Plensa.

The cladding system consists of of more than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins. The architectural glass provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti-glare shield for the intense desert sun, extreme desert temperatures and strong winds. The glass covers more than in area. The Burj&#x27;s typical curtain wall panels measure wide by high and weigh about each, with wider panels near the building&#x27;s edges and taller ones near the top.
The exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6 °C (11 °F) cooler than at its base.

A 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of 4 by Armani, occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors. The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010, but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010. The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards, yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.

The sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools. Floors 20 through 108 have 900 private residential apartments (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor zero-entry swimming pool is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for the 122nd, 123rd, and 124th, where the Atmosphere restaurant, sky lobby, and an indoor and outdoor observation deck are located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents in February 2010.

The building has 57 elevators and 8 escalators. The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 people per cabin, and include the world&#x27;s fastest double-deck elevators, rising and descending at up to . Engineers initially considered installing the world&#x27;s first triple-deck elevators. The double-deckers are equipped with LCD displays to amuse visitors during their travel to the observation deck. The building has 2,909 stairs from the ground floor to the 160th floor.

=== Plumbing systems ===
The Burj Khalifa&#x27;s water system supplies an average of of water per day through of pipes. An additional of piping serves the fire emergency system, and supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system.

=== Air conditioning ===
The air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground. At peak cooling times, the tower&#x27;s cooling is , equivalent to that provided by of melting ice in one day. Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park.

=== Window cleaning ===
To wash the 24,348 windows, totaling of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks, each holding a bucket machine. Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the building is cleaned by a crew that uses ropes to descend from the top to gain access. Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior.

Unmanned machines clean the top 27 additional tiers and the glass spire. The cleaning system was developed in Melbourne, Australia, by CoxGomyl, a manufacturer of building maintenance units, at a cost of A$8 million.

== Features ==
=== Fountain ===
Outside the Burj Khalifa, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh 800 million (US$217 million). Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is long and shoots water into the air while accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and other music. It is the world&#x27;s largest choreographed fountain. On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain.

=== Observation deck ===

An outdoor observation deck, named &quot;At the Top&quot;, opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At , it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened. After this was initially surpassed in December 2011 by &quot;Cloud Top 488&quot; on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at , Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at , once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014. Subsequently, on February 18, 2019, the Burj Khalifa also opened The Lounge observatory at – the highest lounge in the world, However, in June 2016 the Shanghai Tower opened with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres, thus taking the title of the world&#x27;s highest observation deck. 

The Burj Khalifa&#x27;s 124th floor observation deck also features a so-called electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct° of Montréal, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions. To reduce the daily rush of sightseers, management allows visitors to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time, at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot.

On 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public for two months after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes.

When the tide is low and visibility is high, people can see the shores of Iran (which is around away) from the top of the skyscraper.

=== Park ===
Burj Khalifa is surrounded by an park designed by landscape architects SWA Group. Like the tower, the park&#x27;s design was based on the flower of the &quot;Hymenocallis&quot;, a desert plant. At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the &quot;Hymenocallis&quot; flower.

The plants are watered by water collected from the building&#x27;s cooling system. The system provides annually. WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park&#x27;s six water features.

On the higher floors, the sun is seen for several minutes after it has set at ground level. Those living above the 80th floor should wait two extra minutes to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor should wait three minutes.

== Construction ==
The tower was constructed by Samsung C&amp;T from South Korea, which also did work on the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101. Samsung C&amp;T built the tower in a joint venture with BESIX from Belgium and Arabtec from the UAE. Turner was the project manager on the main construction contract. Hong Kong-based Far East Aluminium combined to provide the exterior cladding for Burj Khalifa.

The contractor and the engineer of record was Hyder Consulting. Under UAE law, the contractor and the engineer of record is jointly and severally liable for the performance of Burj Khalifa.

The primary structure is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project. Burj Khalifa&#x27;s construction used of concrete and of steel rebar, and construction took 22 million man-hours. In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel to surpass the 600 metres weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next 4th level, and the rest was by metal columns &quot;jacketed&quot; or &quot;covered&quot; with concrete to a then world record delivery height of , the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during the construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load. The remaining structure above was constructed of lighter steel.

In 2003, 33 test holes were drilled to study the strength of the bedrock underlying the structure. &quot;Weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone&quot; was found, just metres below the surface. Samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of 140 metres, finding weak to very weak rock all the way. The study described the site as part of a &quot;seismically active area&quot;. Another challenging element was the shamal which often creates sandstorms.

Over of concrete, weighing more than were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre in diameter by 43 m in length, buried more than deep. The foundation was designed to support the total building weight of approximately . This weight was then divided by the compressive strength of concrete which is 30 MPa which yielded 450 sq. metres of vertical normal effective area, which then yielded 12 metres by 12 metres dimensions. A cathodic protection system is under the concrete to neutralise the sulphate and chloride-rich groundwater and prevent corrosion.

During the construction of the Burj Khalifa, over 35,000 tonnes of structural steel which held the Palace of the Republic, the former parliament building of the German Democratic Republic, the Volkskammer, in East Berlin together were shipped to Dubai in 2008.

The Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised. Pressurised, air-conditioned refuge floors are located every 13 floors (on floors G, 13, 26, 39, 52, etc.) where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire.

Special mixes of concrete were made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. CTLGroup, working for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.

The consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach . To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher. Cooler concrete cures more evenly and is, therefore, less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.

=== Real estate values ===
In March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project&#x27;s developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m2). He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5 billion.

The project&#x27;s completion coincided with the Great Recession, and with vast overbuilding in the country, leading to high vacancies and foreclosures. With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion-dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi. Subsequently, in a surprise move at its opening ceremony, the tower was renamed Burj Khalifa, said to honour the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his crucial support.

Because of the slumping demand in Dubai&#x27;s property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening. Out of 900 apartments in the tower, 825 were still empty at that time. Over the next 30 months, overseas investors steadily bought up available apartments and office space. By October 2012, Emaar reported that around 80% of the apartments were occupied.

=== Official launch ceremony ===

The ceremony was broadcast live on a giant screen on Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere. Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene. In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected.

The opening was held on 4 January 2010. The ceremony featured a display of 10,000 fireworks, light beams projected on and around the tower, and further sound, light and water effects. The celebratory lighting was designed by UK lighting designers Speirs and Major Associates. Using the 868 powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the façade and spire of the tower, different lighting sequences were choreographed, together with more than 50 different combinations of other effects.

== Controversies ==
=== Incidents ===
On 10 May 2011, an Asian migrant worker in his mid-30s jumped to his death from the 147th floor onto the 108th floor&#x27;s deck. Dubai police said he killed himself because his company refused to let him leave the country.

On 18 May 2015, Dubai police disputed a report that a Portuguese tourist named Laura Vanessa Nunes fell to her death from the Burj Khalifa the prior 16 November, claiming that she fell from the Jumeirah Lake Towers. Nine News obtained emails from Portugal&#x27;s embassy in the UAE under freedom of information laws, which indicated that the female tourist jumped from the 148th floor of the Burj Khalifa.

=== Labour ===

The Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia. This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment. On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site. Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned £4.34 a day, and labourers earned £2.84. According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay. During construction, one construction-related death was reported. Workplace injuries and deaths in the UAE are poorly documented, according to Human Rights Watch.

In March 2006 about 2,500 workers, upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers, and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost £500,000 in damage. Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.

== New Year&#x27;s Eve ==
Emaar New Year&#x27;s Eve is an annual event held every 31 December at Burj Khalifa, organised by Emaar Properties. The event consists of fireworks launched from Burj Khalifa, a light and laser show on the facade of Burj Khalifa, and an accompanying soundtrack and a special fountain show on The Dubai Fountain choreographed to the soundtrack. The Emaar New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks celebration originated in 2010 with the inauguration of the world&#x27;s tallest building, Burj Khalifa. The celebration was broadcast live to more than 2 million people and lasted for 3 minutes.

Since 2011, national live broadcasting rights have been held by Dubai Media Incorporated and Dubai TV.

Emaar New Year&#x27;s Eve has won two Guinness World Records, including &#x27;Largest LED-Illuminated Facade&#x27; in 2015 and 2019.

In 2017 and 2018, Emaar New Year&#x27;s Eve was broadcast live on Twitter, and YouTube. In 2020, it was broadcast live for the first time on Zoom.

In 2021, Emaar celebrated solidarity in honour of frontline workers of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the 2022 event, a laser feature was installed on The Dubai Fountain in sync with the Burj Khalifa&#x27;s laser and fireworks show.

== BASE jumping ==
The building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:

In May 2008, Hervé Le Gallou and David McDonnell, dressed as engineers, entered Burj Khalifa (around at the time), and jumped off a balcony situated several floors below the 160th floor.

On 8 January 2010, with permission of the authorities, Nasr Al Niyadi and Omar Al Hegelan, from the Emirates Aviation Society, broke the world record for the highest BASE jump from a building after they leapt from a crane-suspended platform attached to the 160th floor at . The two men descended the vertical drop at a speed of up to , with enough time to open their parachutes 10 seconds into the 90-second jump.

On 21 April 2014, with permission of the authorities and support from several sponsors, highly experienced French BASE jumpers Vince Reffet and Fred Fugen broke the Guinness world record for the highest BASE jump from a building after they leapt from a specially designed platform, built at the very top of the pinnacle, at .

== Climbing ==
On 28 March 2011, Alain &quot;Spiderman&quot; Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa. The climb to the top of the spire took 6 hours. To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness.

== Awards ==
In June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 &quot;Best Tall Building Middle East &amp; Africa&quot; award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for the best project of the year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010. Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, said:

Burj Khalifa was also the recipient of the following awards.

<text>The European Republicans Movement (, MRE) is a minor social-liberal political party in Italy.

From 2007 to 2010 the party was a founding member and associate of the Democratic Party, the leading centre-left party in Italy. In 2011 the MRE was merged into the Italian Republican Party, the party from which it had seceded in 2001. The MRE was also a member of the pan-European European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), and its long-standing leader was Luciana Sbarbati.

==History==
In 2001 the Italian Republican Party (PRI), after five years within the centre-left coalition, decided to join the centre-right House of Freedoms instead. The MRE was formed by those Republicans who refused such a decision and wanted to remain in the centre-left. The MRE took part in the consolidation of The Olive Tree as a joint centre-left electoral list both for the 2004 European Parliament election and the 2006 general election, along with the Democrats of the Left and Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy. The list won 220 out of 630 deputies (including two Republicans, Luciana Sbarbati and Adriano Musi) as part of The Union.

In 2007 the MRE was a founding member of the Democratic Party (PD), but continued to exist as an associate party and retained almost entirely its autonomy. In the 2008 general election, Sbarbati and Musi were elected to the Senate and often distinguished themselves from Democrats in key votes. Notably, they opposed European Parliament electoral law reform in 2009.

The common battle against electoral reform favored a reconciliation with the PRI. During the 2009 congress of the MRE the two parties signed a joint declaration, under which - despite their different coalition allegiances - they pledged to join forces on key issues, especially those concerning civil liberties and freedom of research.

In April 2010, Sbarbati led the MRE out of the PD and joined the Union of the Centre (UdC) in the Senate. In January 2011 the party sought a reconciliation with the PRI, which was reached two months later.

Following the decision of the PRI to join the centre-right coalition in the 2020 regional elections, the MRE split away from it again and regained its autonomy. The two parties ran in separate coalitions during the 2022 elections: the MRE joined the Democratic Party - Democratic and Progressive Italy list, while the PRI joined the Action - Italia Viva list.

<doc id="794969" wikidata="Q3315947" url="?curid=794969" title="Blue ribbon">
<text>Blue ribbons are typically a symbol of high quality. The association comes from The Blue Riband, a prize awarded for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by passenger liners and, prior to that from Cordon Bleu, which referred to the blue ribbon worn by the French knightly Order of the Holy Spirit.
The spelling &quot;blue riband&quot; is still encountered in most English-speaking countries, but in the United States, the term was altered to &quot;blue ribbon&quot;, and ribbons of this color came to be awarded for first place in certain athletic or other competitive endeavors (such as county and state fairs). 

It has also been applied to distinguished members of a group or commission who have convened to address a situation or problem; in these cases, the usual usage is &quot;blue ribbon commission&quot; or &quot;blue-ribbon panel&quot;.

==Fair competitions==
In some fair competitions in the U.S., particularly 4-H and FFA livestock and horticultural events, blue ribbons may be awarded to any project or exhibit which meets or exceeds all of a competition&#x27;s judging criteria. In Canada, New Zealand and Great Britain, blue ribbons are awarded to &quot;second&quot; place, with red ribbons awarded to first.

The project may not necessarily be the first-place finisher, however. In such cases, a purple ribbon may be given to the champion and the second-place (or reserve) champion.

==Usage as an awareness or activism ribbon==
Blue ribbons have also been used as awareness ribbons for numerous different causes. Notable examples:

* The &quot;Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign&quot; is an online campaign by the EFF endorsing the protection of free speech on the Internet.
* The blue ribbon is internationally used to spread awareness of chronic fatigue syndrome.
* A blue ribbon is also the ribbon used for awareness for the autoimmune disease of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome.
* Blue ribbons are used internationally to express solidarity for the safe return of the hostages taken by Hamas in Israel.
* In Canada, it is the symbol of an anti-tobacco, anti-second hand smoke campaign. It has the same meaning in Japan. 
* Students of the Hugh Boyd Secondary School in Richmond, British Columbia started the &quot;Blue Ribbon Campaign&quot; in 1999. Each year it has grown and now has taken on a national scope. Singapore is the first country in the region to adopt The Blue Ribbon initiative started by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region, on a nationwide scale with 10 markets and food centres.
* In Spain, a blue ribbon (&quot;lazo azul&quot;) was used between 1993 and 2018 by those opposing the terrorism of ETA.
* During the political battle in Israel over the disengagement from the Gaza Strip, blue ribbons indicated support for the disengagement, while orange ribbons indicated opposition.
* In Japan, a blue ribbon is a symbol against abductions of Japanese citizen by North Korea, which took place during 1977 to 1983. The blue ribbon symbolizes the Sea of Japan, between Japan and Korea.
* In the Philippines, the Senate has a Blue Ribbon Committee which serves as an oversight to government accountability and conducts investigations against corrupt officials.
* In spring 2007, thousands of World Bank employees started wearing blue ribbons as a symbol of support for the cause of good governance. This was seen as a silent protest against World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, who had to step down several weeks later due to charges of nepotism.
* In Sweden, there is a temperance organization with the name &quot;Blå bandet&quot; (The Blue Ribbon).
* In the United States, blue ribbons are also symbols for several disorders. The blue ribbon (and awareness bracelet from CCFA) are used to signify Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, and associated gastrointestinal diseases. A light blue ribbon is the symbol of prostate cancer awareness, a royal blue ribbon is the symbol of mesothelioma awareness, and a dark blue ribbon is the symbol of colorectal cancer (colon cancer and rectal cancer) awareness. Blue is also used in the multi-colored ribbons symbolizing awareness of bladder cancer and thyroid cancer. Shaped like the letter &quot;P&quot;, it is an American symbol for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. 
* The blue ribbon is used as an emblems against child abuse by the National Exchange Club for their national project, the Prevention of Child Abuse. The Club adopted the blue ribbon in 1979 with the encouragement of National President Edward North Jr., a physician from Jackson, Mississippi, who observed increased instances of abuse through his medical practice. The blue ribbon became the emblem of the project following the example of Bonnie Finney. The club sponsors numerous Blue Ribbon Campaigns and Child Abuse Prevention Month in April. In the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, the Penn State Nittany Lions football team announced that they will wear a blue ribbon to support child abuse victims. 
* The blue ribbon in Hong Kong represents support of the Hong Kong police, in opposition to the yellow ribbon, which represents the Umbrella movement since the 2014 Hong Kong protests.
* In Denmark, FAIM (Association for Autoimmune Diseases) uses the Blue ribbon to represent all autoimmune diseases (https://www.faim.dk/awareness-logo-og-sloejfe-for-alle-autoimmune-sygdomme/)

==Other uses==
* The Norwegian Cancer Society (NCS) has a blue ribbon campaign each November, in order to raise awareness about prostate cancer.

* Blue ribbons for boys (and pink for girls) were used from the mid-19th century on christening gowns in Paris, and to a limited extent in the United States. In St. Petersburg (Russia) ribbons of the same color scheme were used on white funeral shrouds for children.
*In Australia and New Zealand, safe seats are sometimes described as &quot;blue-ribbon seats&quot;. Safe seats for the two countries&#x27; major centre-left parties (the Australian Labor Party and the New Zealand Labour Party) were in a single instance referred to by a prominent daily newspaper as &quot;red-ribbon seats&quot;, however this is not a legitimate point of reference, as seats where any political interest holds as strong majority have for many decades, commonly been called blue ribbon seats. 

*In Australia, blue ribbon is also a term referring to shares of any company on the stock exchange deemed to be secure investment.

<text>The Phoenix (stylized as &quot;The Phœnix&quot;) was the name of several alternative weekly periodicals published in the United States by Phoenix Media/Communications Group of Boston, Massachusetts, including the Portland Phoenix and the now-defunct Boston Phoenix, Providence Phoenix and Worcester Phoenix. These publications emphasized local arts and entertainment coverage as well as lifestyle and political coverage. The &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot;, which was published until 2023, is now owned by another company, New Portland Publishing.

The papers, like most alternative weeklies, are somewhat similar in format and editorial content to &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

==History==

===Origin===
&quot;The Phoenix&quot; was founded in 1965 by Joe Hanlon, a former editor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Tech&quot;. Since many Boston-area college newspapers were printed at the same printing firm, Hanlon&#x27;s idea was to do a four-page single-sheet insert with arts coverage and ads. He began with the Harvard Business School&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Harbus News&quot;. A student there, James T. Lewis, became Hanlon&#x27;s advertising manager.

&quot;Boston After Dark&quot; began March 2, 1966. Theater enthusiast Larry Stark began contributing theater reviews with the second issue. When the insert idea did not pan out, the trio continued &quot;Boston After Dark&quot; as a weekly free paper.

A year after the launch, Hanlon sold off his half to Lewis. For three years, &quot;Boston After Dark&quot; kept the four-page format, with Lewis as publisher, Jane Steidemann as editor, Stephen M. Mindich as ad salesman and Stark as full-time theater critic and copy editor, plus film reviews by Deac Rossell, who later went on to become head of programming at London&#x27;s National Film Theatre.

Arnie Reisman was appointed executive editor beginning in November 1968 and ending in November 1971. During Reisman&#x27;s term of office, what began as &quot;Boston After Dark&quot;, a 16-page entertainment weekly was turned into a 156-page news weekly on the order of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

===Expansion===

As the paper expanded, Mindich acquired a half interest. Stark quit in 1972 and began reviewing for the rival &quot;Cambridge Phoenix&quot;, which had begun October 9, 1969, started by Jeffrey Tarter. The first managing editor of the &quot;Cambridge Phoenix&quot; was April Smith, who later became a novelist (&quot;Good Morning, Killer&quot;) and TV writer-producer (&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;).

Following a two-week writers&#x27; strike in August 1972, the &quot;Cambridge Phoenix&quot; was sold to &quot;Boston After Dark&quot;. Mindich&#x27;s merger then became known as &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, with &quot;Boston After Dark&quot; used as the name for the paper&#x27;s arts and entertainment section, as well as the nameplate for a free edition of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; distributed on college campuses in Boston. In the conflicts between writers and management, ousted writers immediately started another weekly, &quot;The Real Paper&quot; (which began August 2, 1972, and continued until 1981), while management continued the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;.

In 1988, the company that owned the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Phoenix Media/Communications Group, bought a similar publication in neighboring Providence, Rhode Island, called &quot;The NewPaper&quot;, which had been founded in 1978 by &quot;Providence Journal&quot; columnist Ty Davis. It continued under the &quot;NewPaper&quot; name until 1993, when it became the &quot;Providence Phoenix&quot;. In 1999, PM/CG branched out into Portland, Maine, by creating the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot;. That same year the nameplate changed from &quot;Phoenix B.A.D.&quot; to &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;. From 1992 through 2000, there was also a &quot;Worcester Phoenix&quot;, but it folded due to Worcester&#x27;s dwindling arts market.

In 2005, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; underwent a major redesign, switching from a broadsheet/Berliner format to a tabloid format and introduced a new logo in order to increase its appeal to younger readers.

Towards the end of its existence, The &quot;Phoenix&quot; had a weekly circulation of 253,000, and its website featured 90% of the paper&#x27;s content, as well as extra content not included in the paper.

===Mergers, closures and ownership change===
On August 1, 2012, it was announced that &quot;Stuff Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; newspaper would merge and the result would be a weekly magazine to be called &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, to debut in the fall of 2012. The first issue of the new, glossy-paper &quot;Phoenix&quot; had a cover date of September 21, 2012. On March 14, 2013, the publisher announced that the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; would fold effective as of the March 15, 2013, print edition, though the Portland and Providence papers would be unaffected. In October 2014, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; announced that their Providence paper would also cease publication, with last issue being the October 17 issue.

The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; published its last issue on March 14, 2013. A statement from publisher Mindich in that issue blamed the 2007 financial crisis and changes in the media business, particularly the downturn in print advertising revenue, as the reasons for the closing.

In November 2014, Mindich sold the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot; to the Portland News Club LLC, publishers of &quot;The Portland Daily Sun&quot;. Although the &quot;Daily Sun&quot; would cease publication one month later, the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot; continues to be published weekly by new owners.

In January 2019, the owner of the since-renamed Country News Club, Mark Guerringe, announced that the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot; would move from once weekly to bi-weekly. In February, the paper ceased publication altogether, with an announcement that the paper had folded coming in April. In an interview with the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot;, Guerringue said he may try to relaunch the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot; on a membership basis or as a non-profit, funded by ads for Maine&#x27;s legal marijuana industry.

In August 2019, New Portland Publishing purchased the Portland Phoenix relaunching it as a weekly publication on November 13, 2019. Partners of New Portland Publishing Karen Wood (former long-time Publisher of &quot;The Forecaster&quot;) assumed the role of Publisher, and Marian McCue (former owner of &quot;The Forecaster&quot; and member of the Maine Press Association Hall of Fame) became the editor.

On July 23, 2023, the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot; published its final issue, citing a decline in advertising revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Archiving===
After the closing of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; and the &quot;Providence Phoenix&quot;, Mindich reassured the public that the websites would be maintained, and the online and print archives would be preserved. 

In November 2015, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; announced that Mindich, with the help of former &quot;Phoenix&quot; columnist and current Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy, had donated the &quot;Phoenix&quot; archives to Northeastern University&#x27;s Snell Library Archives and Special Collections. The gift also included other publications associated with the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, including &quot;Boston After Dark,&quot; the Portland, Providence and Worcester &quot;Phoenix&quot; editions; &quot;El Planeta&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot; and &quot;Stuff at Night&quot; magazines, and early issues of &quot;The Real Paper&quot;. Hard copies of the publications are currently available to the public at Snell Library. Northeastern&#x27;s goal was to digitize the collection and make it available online, but the cost was found to be prohibitive. In 2021, it learned that the Internet Archive already had ownership of the complete microfilm collection of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; from 1973 to 2013. Northeastern then allowed the Internet Archive to make the collection available for download by the public without limits.

Records from the Boston WFNX radio station were donated to Northeastern University&#x27;s Snell Library Archives and Special Collections.

In 2020, the online citizen science website Zooniverse started archiving the 1974 card file index, with the help of site users. After the finishing of the 1974 archives, Zooniverse moved to the 1980 index.

==Radio==
Over the years, PMCG acquired radio stations in Boston, Portland and Providence, notably the Boston alternative rock radio station WFNX. The company owned stations serving Metro Boston, New Hampshire, and Maine. The radio stations covered the same music, arts and political scene as the paper and sold to many of the same advertisers. The Maine station, WPHX-FM, was sold to the owner of WXEX in 2011, while on May 16, 2012, the over-the-air signal and broadcast tower for the Boston station WFNX was sold to Clear Channel Communications and New Hampshire station WFEX was sold to Blount Communications. Following FCC approval of the sale, WFNX stopped broadcasting on Tuesday, July 24, 2012; the webcast ended in May 2013. Former WFNX DJs and personalities Julie Kramer, Adam 12, Henry Santoro, and Paul Driscoll joined Boston.com and formed Radio BDC, another internet radio station.

Records from WFNX were also donated to Northeastern University&#x27;s Snell Library Archives and Special Collections.

==Awards==
&quot;The Phoenix&quot; received many awards for excellence in journalism, including honors from the New England Press Association, the Penny-Missouri Newspaper Awards, the American Bar Association Gavel Awards, Michael J. Metcalfe Diversity in Media Awards and the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Awards.

In 1994, &quot;Phoenix&quot; classical music writer Lloyd Schwartz was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.

<text>Metlapilcoatlus is a genus of pit vipers endemic to Mexico and Central America. Six species are currently recognized. The common names suggest they are able to leap at an attacker, but this is likely exaggerated. Common names for the species include jumping pitvipers and jumping vipers. The genus name comes from the Nahuatl name &quot;metlapilcohuatl&quot;, which means of the oblong grindstone held in the hand when grinding corn—alluding to the snake&#x27;s short, stocky body. 

==Description==
All of these snakes are extremely thick-bodied, with &quot;M. nummifer&quot; being the most stout. The head is large, with small eyes and a broadly rounded snout. The tail is short, not prehensile, and accounts for only 15% of the total length.

The color pattern usually consists of a gray-brown or reddish brown ground color (sometimes yellow, cream, purplish brown or black), overlaid with a series of lateral and dorsal blotches. The shape of these blotches is subject to some variation, but is sometimes still helpful for identification.

==Geographic range==
Found in the mountains of eastern Mexico southeastward on the Atlantic versant and lowlands though Central America to central Panama. On the Pacific versant, they occur in isolated populations in east-central and southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama.

==Behavior==
The common name alludes to the supposed ability these snakes have to launch themselves at an attacker during a strike, thereby bridging a distance that is equal to or greater than the length of the body. Mehrtens (1987) states that they live up to their name, striking at their assailants with such force that they actually leave the ground. Campbell and Lamar (2004), on the other hand, describe this as greatly exaggerated, saying that actually these snakes are only able to strike about half of their own body length. In addition, they describe them as slow moving and non-aggressive. However, when provoked all species will put on a rather dramatic open-mouthed threat display.

These snakes may be active both during the day and at night. On the other hand, populations found at higher altitudes seem to be active only during daylight hours and never at night.

==Feeding==
Adults feed mainly on small mammals and lizards, while juveniles feed on orthopterans and skinks.

==Venom==
Unlike most vipers, members of this genus will strike and then hold on and chew. In one case, a machete was used to pry off the jaws. March (1929) wrote that &quot;M. mexicanus&quot; (&quot;M. nummifer&quot;) will hang on and make half a dozen punctures unless quickly and forcibly removed. However, the effects of the venom include only transient pain and mild swelling. In one part of Honduras the locals even insist that the snake (&quot;M. nummifer&quot;) is not venomous. Laboratory studies suggest that &quot;Metlapilcoatlus&quot; venoms are unlikely to lead to consumption coagulopathy and incoagulable blood in humans.

<text>The following is the 1964–65 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1964 through August 1965. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancel after the 1963–64 season.

This is the first full season in which NBC broadcast more than 50% of its schedule in color, a fact which the network emphasized during its September 19–25 premiere week.

CBS and ABC, still mostly in black and white, continued rolling out rural sitcoms; in fall 1964, the networks added &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; (CBS) and &quot;No Time For Sergeants&quot; (ABC) to their respective schedules. According to television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982), critics objected to CBS&#x27;s rural sitcom-heavy schedule, particularly the Gomer Pyle character, but the &quot;high ratings earned by the silly gimmicks and simpleton heroes would assure rural sitcoms spots in the network schedules for years&quot;.

Castleman and Podrazik also point out the large number of &quot;escapist&quot; programs which debuted during the fall of 1964: &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (CBS), &quot;Bewitched&quot; (ABC), &quot;My Living Doll&quot; (CBS), &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (ABC) and &quot;The Munsters&quot; (CBS). Only NBC avoided the escapist trend during the season, with the exception of &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot;.

All times are Eastern and Pacific. Premieres are highlighted in bold while endings are highlighted in &quot;italics&quot;.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

== Sunday ==

Notes: &quot;Mister Ed&quot; aired on CBS from 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. until January 1965, when &quot;World War One&quot; took over the time period.

On NBC, some episodes of &quot;Branded&quot; aired in color. &quot;Buckskin&quot;, which aired on NBC in July and August 1965, consisted of reruns of the 1958–1959 series.

On CBS, &quot;Bill &amp; Martha&quot; was originally supposed to have aired 9:30 p.m., but it was replaced by &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; before it ever began.

== Monday ==

NOTES: On CBS, &quot;Summer Playhouse&quot; was an anthology series made up of a combination of unsold television pilots and reruns of episodes of other anthology series.

== Tuesday ==
== Wednesday ==
== Thursday ==
== Friday ==

Note: On CBS, &quot;Vacation Playhouse&quot; was an anthology series made up entirely of unsold television pilots.

<doc id="794996" wikidata="Q1161568" url="?curid=794996" title="Granulomatosis with polyangiitis">
<text>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener&#x27;s granulomatosis (WG), after German physician Friedrich Wegener, is a rare, long-term, systemic disorder that involves the formation of granulomas and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It is an autoimmune disease and a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels in many organs, but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions, and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye. Damage to the heart, lungs, and kidneys can be fatal.
The cause of GPA is unknown. Genetics have a role in GPA, though the risk of inheritance appears to be low.
GPA treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Severe disease is typically treated with a combination of immunosuppressive medications such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide and high-dose corticosteroids to control the symptoms of the disease, and azathioprine, methotrexate, or rituximab to keep the disease under control. Plasma exchange is also used in severe cases with damage to the lungs, kidneys, or intestines.
The number of new cases of GPA each year is estimated to be between 2.1 and 14.4 new cases per million people in Europe. GPA is rare in Japanese and African-American populations but occurs more often in people of Northern European descent. GPA is estimated to affect three cases per 100,000 people in the United States and affects men and women equally. GPA has infrequently been reported in minors.

==Signs and symptoms==

Initial signs are highly variable, and diagnosis can be severely delayed due to the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. In general, irritation and nasal inflammation are the first signs in most people. Involvement of the upper respiratory tract, such as the nose and sinuses, is seen in nearly all people with GPA. Typical signs and symptoms of nose or sinus involvement include crusting around the nose, stuffiness, nosebleeds, runny nose, and &quot;saddle-nose&quot; deformity due to a hole in the septum of the nose. Inflammation of the outer layers of the eye (scleritis and episcleritis) and conjunctivitis are the most common signs of GPA in the eye; involvement of the eyes is common and occurs in slightly more than half of people with the disease.
* Kidney: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (75%), leading to chronic kidney disease
* Upper airway, eye, and ear disease:
** Ears: conductive hearing loss due to auditory tube dysfunction, sensorineural hearing loss (unclear mechanism)
** Oral cavity: strawberry gingivitis, underlying bone destruction with loosening of teeth, and nonspecific ulcerations throughout the lining of the mouth
* Trachea: Subglottal stenosis
* Lungs: Pulmonary nodules (referred to as &quot;coin lesions&quot;), infiltrates (often interpreted as pneumonia), cavitary lesions, bleeding in the lungs causing a person to cough up blood, and rarely bronchial stenosis
* Arthritis: Pain or swelling (60%), often initially diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis
* Skin: Subcutaneous nodules (granulomas) on the elbow, purpura, and various others (see cutaneous vasculitis)
* Nervous system: Occasionally sensory neuropathy (10%) and rarely mononeuritis multiplex
* Heart, gastrointestinal tract, brain, other organs: Rarely affected

==Causes==
The cause of GPA is unknown, although microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as genetics, have been implicated in its pathogenesis.

==Pathophysiology==
Classic microscopic features of GPA include inflammation of blood vessels associated with poorly formed granulomas, necrosis, and many giant cells. Bacterial colonization with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; has been hypothesized as an initiating factor of the autoimmunity seen in people with GPA. Several genes involved in the immune system including &quot;PTPN22&quot;, &quot;CTLA4&quot;, and human leukocyte antigen genes may influence the risk of developing GPA.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) now are widely presumed to be responsible for the inflammation in GPA. The typical ANCAs in GPA are those that react with proteinase 3, an enzyme prevalent in neutrophil granulocytes. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies have found that ANCAs can activate neutrophils, increase their adherence to endothelium, and induce their degranulation that can damage endothelial cells. This phenomenon could cause extensive damage to the vessel wall, especially to arterioles.

==Diagnosis==

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is usually suspected only when a person has had unexplained symptoms for a long period. Determination of ANCAs can aid in the diagnosis, but positivity is not conclusive, and negative ANCAs are insufficient to reject the diagnosis. More than 90% of people who have GPA test positive for ANCAs. Cytoplasmic-staining ANCAs that react with the enzyme proteinase 3 (cANCA) in neutrophils (a type of white blood cells) are associated with GPA. Involvement of the ears, nose, and throat is more common in granulomatosis with polyangiitis than in the similar condition microscopic polyangiitis.

If the person has signs of kidney involvement or cutaneous vasculitis, a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. Rarely, a thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are the main reason for the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although it is not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. Many biopsies can be nonspecific, though, and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is part of a larger group of vasculitic syndromes called systemic vasculitides or necrotizing vasculopathies, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating antibody termed ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-sized blood vessels. Apart from GPA, this category includes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and microscopic polyangiitis. Although GPA affects small- and medium-sized vessels, it is formally classified as one of the small-vessel vasculitides in the Chapel Hill system.

===Criteria===
In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology accepted classification criteria for GPA. These criteria were not intended for diagnosis but for inclusion in randomized controlled trials. Two or more positive criteria have a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 92.0% of describing GPA.

* Nasal or oral inflammation with painful or painless oral ulcers or purulent or bloody nasal discharge
* Lungs: Abnormal chest X-ray with nodules, infiltrates, or cavities
* Kidneys: Urinary sediment with microscopic hematuria or red cell casts
* Biopsy: Granulomatous inflammation within the arterial wall or in the perivascular area
According to the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) on the nomenclature of systemic vasculitis (1992), establishing the diagnosis of GPA demands
a granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract, and a vasculitis of small to medium-sized vessels.

Several investigators have compared the ACR and Chapel Hill criteria.

In 2022, the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology updated the classification criteria for GPA.

==Treatment==
GPA treatment depends on its severity and whether it has caused organ damage.

===Severe disease===
The standard treatment for severe GPA is to induce remission with immunosuppressants such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide in combination with high-dose corticosteroids. Plasmapheresis is sometimes recommended for very severe manifestations of GPA, such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (as seen in pulmonary-renal syndrome). The use of plasmapheresis in those with GPA and acute kidney failure (renal vasculitis) might reduce progression to end-stage kidney disease at three months.

Oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide are both effective for induction of GPA remission. Oral cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day was the standard treatment for many years; this regimen resulted in complete remission in more than 75% of people with GPA but is associated with significant toxicities, including infertility, inflammation and bleeding from the bladder, and bladder cancer. In contrast, administering pulsed doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide is equally effective for inducing remission, results in a lower cumulative dose, and decreases the incidence of abnormally low white blood cell counts by one-third. However, pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide may be associated with a higher risk of GPA relapse when compared to oral cyclophosphamide. Due to a high frequency of abnormally low white blood cell counts seen with cyclophosphamide treatment, &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; pneumonia is a common complication, so prophylaxis against this pathogen is recommended.

Rituximab may be substituted for cyclophosphamide to induce remission since it is similarly effective and has a comparable side-effect profile. The dose of corticosteroids is generally tapered (decreased) very slowly over several months to reduce the risk of another GPA flare. After a person with GPA has successfully undergone induction and gone into remission, the treatment goal then shifts to maintenance of remission and preventing subsequent GPA flares. Less-toxic immunosuppressing medications such as rituximab, methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, or mycophenolate mofetil are used. TNF inhibitors, such as etanercept, appear to be ineffective and are not recommended for routine use.

===Limited disease===
In generalized non-organ-threatening disease, remission can be achieved with a combination of methotrexate and corticosteroids, where the steroid dose is reduced after a remission has been achieved and methotrexate is used as maintenance therapy. Treatment measures for localised GPA of the nose and sinuses include nasal irrigation, nasal corticosteroids, and antibiotics if infection occurs. If perforation of the nasal septum occurs (or saddle-nose deformity), then surgical repair is recommended.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been proposed to help prevent relapse, though a 2015 Cochrane review did not confirm fewer relapses with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment.

==Prognosis==
Before modern treatments, the two-year survival was under 10% and the average survival was five months. Death usually resulted from uremia or respiratory failure. The revised five-factor score is associated with five-year mortality from GPA and is based on these criteria: Age greater than 65 years, cardiac symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, chronic kidney disease, and the absence of ear, nose, and throat symptoms.

With corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, five-year survival is over 80%. Long-term complications are common (86%), mainly chronic kidney failure, hearing loss, and deafness. The risk of relapse is increased in people with GPA who test positive for anti-PR3 ANCA antibodies and is higher than the relapse risk for microscopic polyangiitis.

Today, medication toxicity is managed more carefully and long-term remissions are possible. Some affected individuals can lead relatively normal lives and remain in remission for 20+ years after treatment.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence is 10–20 cases per million per year. It is exceedingly rare in Japan and in African Americans.

==History==
Scottish otolaryngologist Peter McBride (1854–1946) first described the condition in 1897 in a &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; article entitled &quot;Photographs of a case of rapid destruction of the nose and face&quot;. Heinz Karl Ernst Klinger (born 1907) added information on the anatomical pathology. An early name for the disease was pathergic granulomatosis. The disease is still sometimes confused with lethal midline granuloma and lymphomatoid granulomatosis, both malignant lymphomas.

The full clinical picture was first presented by Friedrich Wegener (1907–1990), a German pathologist, in two reports in 1936 and 1939, leading to the eponymous name Wegener&#x27;s granulomatosis or Wegener granulomatosis (). In 2011, the American College of Rheumatology, the American Society of Nephrology, and the European League Against Rheumatism resolved to change the name to granulomatosis with polyangiitis, given Wegener&#x27;s association with the Nazi Party.

<text>Brett Halliday (July 31, 1904 – February 4, 1977) is the primary pen name of Davis Dresser, an American mystery and western writer. Halliday is best known for the long-lived series of Michael Shayne mysteries he wrote, and later commissioned others to continue. Dresser also wrote westerns, non-series mysteries, and romances under the names Asa Baker, Matthew Blood, Kathryn Culver, Don Davis, Hal Debrett, Anthony Scott, Peter Field, and Anderson Wayne.

==Biography==

Dresser was born in Chicago, Illinois, but mostly grew up in West Texas. Here he lost an eye to barbed wire as a boy, and thus had to wear an eye patch for the rest of his life.

At the age of 14, he ran away from home and enlisted in the U.S. 5th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas, followed by a year of Border Patrol duty on the Rio Grande. After his service, he returned to Texas to finish high school. In search of adventure, Dresser traveled throughout the Southwest working at various odd jobs, including that of muleskinner, farm hand, deckhand on a freighter in the Gulf of Mexico, laborer in the California oilfields, etc. Eventually, he went to Tri-State College of Engineering, where he received a certificate in civil engineering. Back in Texas, he worked as an engineer and surveyor for several years before turning to writing in 1927.

After his first marriage (to Kathleen Rollins, who had two daughters from a previous marriage), Dresser was married to mystery writer Helen McCloy from 1946 to 1961; they had a daughter named Chloe. As partners, they formed a literary agency called Halliday and McCloy. Dresser also established Torquil Publishing Company, which published his books as well as those of other authors, from 1953 to 1965. In 1961, he married Mary Savage, also a writer; their son, Halliday, was born in 1965.

The first Michael Shayne novel was rejected by 21 publishers before being accepted by Henry Holt &amp; Co. in 1939. The Shayne series went on to be highly successful, reprinted in many editions and translated into French, Spanish, Italian, German, Swedish, Japanese and Hebrew.

A radio series based on the Shayne character was heard during the 1940s. Twelve motion pictures were made, seven of them featuring Lloyd Nolan as Shayne. Five of the Nolan films, which were produced by 20th Century Fox, have been released on DVD: &quot;Michael Shayne, Private Detective&quot;; &quot;Sleepers West&quot;; &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;; &quot;Blue, White and Perfect&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die.&quot; After the Fox series ended, five more Shayne films were made by Producers Releasing Corporation which featured Hugh Beaumont as the detective. There was also a TV series in 1960, starring Richard Denning, as well as a pulp fiction magazine that began as &quot;Michael Shayne Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1956 and ran for nearly 30 years. The 2005 film &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; is partly based on Halliday&#x27;s novel &quot;Bodies Are Where You Find Them&quot;. The 2016 film &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;, also directed by Shane Black, acknowledged the works of Brett Halliday.

In 1958, Dresser ceased penning the novels published under the name &quot;Brett Halliday&quot;, and arranged for ghostwriters, among them Bill Pronzini and Robert Terrell, to continue the series. This was likewise the arrangement for the magazine, and later for the Dell paperback originals.

Dresser was a founding member of the Mystery Writers of America, and in 1954 he and McCloy were given Edgar Awards for their critical writings on the genre. He also edited several anthologies of crime stories.

He lived in Santa Barbara, California, until his death at the age of 72.

==Novels==

There is a dispute on how many Halliday novels Dresser wrote himself, and how many were published under his pseudonym, but written by others. Usually it&#x27;s supposed that he stopped writing completely, or for the most part, after &quot;Murder and the Wanton Bride&quot; (1958).

<doc id="795012" wikidata="Q1490375" url="?curid=795012" title="Dog watch">
<text>A dog watch is a work shift, also known as a &quot;watch&quot;, in a maritime watch system that is half the length of a standard watch period. This is typically formed by splitting a single four-hour watch period between 16:00 and 20:00 (4 pm and 8 pm) to form two two-hour dog watches, with the &quot;first&quot; dog watch from 16:00 to 18:00 (4 pm to 6 pm) and the &quot;second&quot; or &quot;last&quot; dog watch from 18:00 to 20:00 (6 pm to 8 pm).

This watch exists because, in order for the crew to rotate through all the watches, it is necessary to have an odd number of watches in a ship&#x27;s day. Splitting one of the watches in half allows the sailors to stand different watches instead of one team being forced to stand the mid-watch every night. The choice of time also allows both watches, if there are only two, to eat an evening meal at about the traditional time.

== Etymology ==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the word &#x27;dogwatch&#x27; is a direct translation from either German or Dutch of a similar term. It originally referred to the night-watch on ships—that is, the time when (on land) all but the dogs were asleep. The name is also said to be derived from Sirius, the &quot;Dog Star&quot;, on the claim that Sirius was the first star that can be seen at night. An alternative folk etymology is that the name arose because someone tasked with one of these &#x27;half&#x27; watches was said to be &#x27;dodging the watch&#x27;, taking or standing the &#x27;dodge watch&#x27;. This became shortened to &#x27;dog watch&#x27;. Another variation is that those sleeping get only &#x27;dog sleep&#x27; in this watch. Stephen Maturin of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin series retells the 19th century humourist Theodore Hook&#x27;s pun that the dog watch is so-named because it is &quot;cur-tailed&quot; (&quot;curtailed&quot;, i.e. shortened).

==Traditional watch system==

The traditional watch system arose from sailing ships of the late 19th century and was used by the Royal Navy and many other Commonwealth navies. It consisted of 5 four-hour periods and 2 two-hour periods. Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day were assigned to one of two divisions: the starboard or the port division. These can be further divided into two parts, e.g., First Port, Second Starboard.

The Royal Navy traditional submarine three watch system is 2 on 4 off during the day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and 3 on 6 off during the night (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.).

<text>H.O.T. (; pronounced &quot;H. O. T.&quot;, acronym for Highfive of Teenagers) was a South Korean boy band that was created by SM Entertainment in 1996. They are considered to be the first K-pop &quot;idol group&quot; and their successful formula became the model for many K-pop groups that followed them. The group consisted of five members: Moon Hee-joon, Jang Woo-hyuk, Tony Ahn, Kangta, and Lee Jae-won.

H.O.T. sold over 6.4 million records in South Korea during their career. They were also commercially successful in China and Taiwan, and were among the first stars of the Korean Wave in Asia.

The group broke up in 2001 following a contract disagreement with SM Entertainment, prompting hundreds of fans to stage protests against the company.
Currently, only Kangta, an executive of SM Entertainment, remains at the company.

== Formation ==
Record producer Lee Soo-man, the founder of SM Entertainment, formed the group in 1996 by using information that he had obtained from polling high school students to find out what their idol pop group would be like. The first member to join the group was Kangta, whom Lee discovered at an amusement park. Next to join were friends and singing partners Moon Hee-joon and Lee Jae-won. Jang Woo-hyuk joined the group after attracting Lee&#x27;s attention by winning first place in a dance contest. Finally, Tony Ahn joined the group after auditioning for Lee in Los Angeles.

==History==

=== 1996–1997: Debut and breakthrough ===
H.O.T.&#x27;s first public appearance was in August 1996, at the opening stage of the 1996 012 Concert. Their TV debut came on September 7, 1996, performing &quot;Descendants of Warriors&#x27; on the variety show &quot;Saturday! Saturday Is Fun&quot;. &quot;We Hate All Kinds of Violence&quot;, the group&#x27;s debut album, was a success, selling 1.5 million copies. Their first single, &quot;Descendants of Warriors&quot;, was a critique of schoolyard bullying, while their second single, &quot;Candy&quot;, was a cheerful bubblegum pop song that established H.O.T.&#x27;s popularity, especially among teenage girls. That year, H.O.T. won Best New Artist at the Golden Disc Awards.

In July 1997, H.O.T. released their second album, &quot;Wolf and Sheep&quot;, which sold 1 million copies in ten days. The album included the singles &quot;Wolf and Sheep&quot;, &quot;Happiness&quot;, and &quot;We Are the Future&quot;, the first of which was banned from airplay due to its use of strong language. Nonetheless, the album was both commercially and critically successful, winning the Grand Prize at both the 1997 Golden Disc Awards and the 1997 Seoul Music Awards. Additionally, &quot;We Are the Future&quot; was nominated for an International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. By this time, H.O.T. had become a &quot;social sensation&quot; in South Korea. In 1997, H.O.T. also released their first Chinese album, the sales of which helped the group survive the slump in South Korean record sales that followed the Asian financial crisis.

===1998–1999: &quot;Resurrection&quot;, controversy and &quot;I Yah&quot;===
H.O.T. released their third album, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, in September 1998. The album, which featured a variety of styles including hardcore hip hop, sold more than 1.1 million copies by the following year. At the 1998 Seoul Music Awards, &quot;Resurrection&quot; was awarded the Grand Prize, which it shared with &quot;Special Album&quot; by Sechs Kies. Netizens accused the album of plagiarism on account of alleged similarities between the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Line Up!&quot; and &quot;Killing In The Name&quot;, a song by American rock band Rage Against the Machine. However, the song won the International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award for MTV Korea at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.

H.O.T. released a live greatest hits album in April 1999. On June 25, H.O.T. performed alongside Michael Jackson and popular South Korean girl group S.E.S. at a benefit concert in Seoul arranged by Jackson. On September 15, 1999, H.O.T. released their fourth album, &quot;I Yah!&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track was about a 1999 fire that killed kindergarten students at the Sealand Youth Training Center in South Korea. The album sold more than 1.3 million copies. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release on September 18, H.O.T. became the first K-pop group to perform at the Seoul Olympic Stadium, where over 40,000 fans saw them perform.

===2000–2001: &quot;Outside Castle&quot;, &quot;Age of Peace&quot; and disbandment===
On February 1, 2000, H.O.T. performed for 13,000 fans in Beijing at their first concert in China. The group became immensely popular among Chinese teenagers, and reportedly sold around 400,000 copies of their albums in the country by January 2000. Their success inspired SM Entertainment and other South Korean entertainment companies to promote their artists in China. H.O.T. released their fifth album, &quot;Outside Castle&quot;, in September 2000. That year, the group also starred in the sci-fi movie &quot;Age of Peace&quot;, in which they portrayed soccer players living in a futuristic society. Despite H.O.T.&#x27;s popularity at the time, the movie was not a hit.

H.O.T. announced its disbandment at a press conference in Seoul in May 2001. Members An, Lee and Jang told the press that they were leaving S.M. Entertainment because they could not come to an agreement with the company over a new contract. In the following days, hundreds of the group&#x27;s fans protested outside of S.M. Entertainment headquarters. Some fans blocked roads and threw rocks at the company headquarters&#x27; windows to protest what they believed were unjust actions against H.O.T. on the part of S.M. Entertainment. It was later reported that the contractual disagreements between H.O.T. and S.M. Entertainment concerned the group members&#x27; pay, which was only about $10,000 USD for every 1 million albums they sold.

After the split, Kangta and Moon were offered lucrative contracts by S.M. Entertainment as solo artists. An, Lee and Jang signed to Yejeon Media and formed a three-member group called jtL, which experienced moderate success before they disbanded in 2003. All five former H.O.T. members have since pursued solo careers and are still active in the entertainment industry.

=== 2018–2019: Reunion and later career===
In February 2018, H.O.T. was featured on the South Korean variety show &quot;Infinite Challenge&quot; in the &quot;Saturday, Saturday is for Singers&quot; () special, a recurring segment on the show which showcases famous singers from the 1990s and was notably responsible for the reunion of their first-generation counterparts Sechs Kies. All five members appeared on the show, marking their first appearance as a complete group since 2003.

During the years in between disbandment and the reunion, the possibility of a reunion had been repeatedly brought up. Following the successful reunions of their fellow first-generation groups g.o.d and Fly to the Sky in 2014, a Naver online poll revealed that H.O.T ranked first as the first-generation idol group K-pop fans most wanted to see again. In 2016 it was reported that the members had been in contact with one another and met with Lee Soo-man to discuss the possibility of reuniting for the 20th anniversary of their debut but it ultimately did not come to fruition.

On August 31, 2018, it was announced that H.O.T. would be independently holding their reunion concert, &#x27;Forever [Highfive Of Teenagers]&#x27;, on October 13 and 14 in Seoul Olympic Main Stadium with 100,000 attendees.

<text>Hugo Porta (born 11 September 1951) is an Argentine retired rugby union player. Considered one of the best fly-halves the sport has seen, he is an inductee of both the International Rugby Hall of Fame and IRB Hall of Fame. During the 1970s and 1980s, he played 58 times for Argentina, captaining them on 34 occasions, including leading them during the first World Cup in 1987.

Porta made his international debut in 1971. His best performances for &quot;Los Pumas&quot; came in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with a draw with France in 1977, a 24–13 win against Australia in 1979, and a 21–21 draw with New Zealand in 1985.

In December 2018, Porta was elected as president of Argentine sports club Banco Nación, where he spent his entire career as player.

==Career==

Porta was born in Buenos Aires. He played football (soccer) and almost signed for Boca Juniors but then changed to rugby union, joining Banco Nación. Porta made his debut for Argentina on 10 October 1971 against Chile in the starting line up. He earned another three caps that year in games against Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The following year, Argentina played two games against South Africa in Buenos Aires.

Porta played seven times for the national team the following season, including matches against Romania as well as Ireland and Scotland XVs (non-cap). During the 1974 and 1975 seasons, Argentina played four Tests against France. In 1976, games were also played against Welsh and New Zealand XVs (non-cap). Porta became the national captain in 1977, and in his first game in charge, led the Pumas against France. Argentina lost 3–26, with Porta getting Argentina&#x27;s only points through a penalty goal. However, in the following match, the nations drew 18–18, Porta providing all of Argentina&#x27;s points through six penalties, as, for France, did Jean-Michel Aguirre, who also kicked six penalties.
Porta led Argentina in two matches during October 1978; against an England XV (non-cap) and Italy. The following season he led the Pumas against a New Zealand XV (non-cap) in a two match series. On 27 October 1979, Porta led Argentina to a victory over Australia in Buenos Aires, winning 24–13. Porta kicked two conversions, one penalty and three drop goals to contribute 18 points during the match. Although the following leg was lost 12–17, the win became a landmark for Argentina.

Porta captained the South American Jaguars on three tours of South Africa between 1980 and 1984. Following the 1980 South America tour, Porta led Argentina to two victories over Fiji, and drew with England in 1981. During the second South America tour in 1982, South America won the second of the two internationals in Bloemfontein, with Porta scoring all of the 21 points in the victory. Argentina also defeated Australia 18–3 in Brisbane at Ballymore in 1983. Another South American tour took place in 1984. Argentina also defeated France 24–16 in June 1985. Following a 20–33 loss to New Zealand that October, the famous 21–21 draw happened on 2 November, with Porta kicking four penalties and three drop goals for 21 points. Porta is the only Argentine player to have represented the South African Barbarians Club.

Porta led Argentina to the 1987 World Cup, at the age of 36 and retired after the tournament. In their first pool match, they lost to Fiji 28–9. The following game saw Argentina win, defeating Italy 25–16. They were defeated 46–15 by New Zealand in the last game. He came out of retirement briefly in 1990 to play games against Ireland, England and Scotland. In 1991, he was appointed Argentine Ambassador to South Africa by President Carlos Menem, and in 1994, became Argentina&#x27;s Minister for Sport. In 2000, his car was carjacked by thieves in Buenos Aires, but they returned his vehicle after reading whose car they had stolen in the newspapers.

In September 2007, former England captain Will Carling included Porta among his list of top ten rugby players of all time. Former Australian fly-half Mark Ella wrote of Porta that, &quot;I&#x27;ve never played against a better five-eighth.&quot;
