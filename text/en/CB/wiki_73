<text>The Cozumel thrasher (Toxostoma guttatum) is a bird from the mockingbird family (Mimidae), which is endemic to the island of Cozumel off the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. It is believed to be the most critically endangered species of bird in Mexico – if it indeed still exists, which is probable but not certain.

This bird is closely related to the long-billed and brown thrashers. It has been generally described as shy, but there have been descriptions to the contrary. It was once abundant throughout Cozumel before two hurricanes greatly affected its numbers. Invasive species are also thought to have impacted the population of the thrasher.

==Taxonomy ==
The Cozumel thrasher was first described as &quot;Harporhynchus guttatus&quot; by Robert Ridgway in 1885. It has been described as a subspecies to its relative the long-billed thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma longirostre&quot;), but was considered a separate species when it was determined in a 1998 study that it differed genetically more than five percent from both the long-billed and brown thrashers (&quot;T. rufum&quot;). In the same study it was determined to be the basal member of the &quot;rufum&quot; group of &quot;Toxostoma&quot; thrashers. The bird is monotypic.

== Description ==
The thrasher is in length. The adult has a brown crown, back, shoulders, and rump that becomes more red in its tint on its lower back and rump. Greater and lesser coverts are a warm brown with concealed white tips, preceded with a black bar. Primaries and secondaries are grayish-brown with warm rufous-brown outer webs. The rectrices are also have a warm brown color. The lores and ear-coverts are a mottled grey brown. The chin and throat are an off-white color with a blackish partial malar stripe. The chest is a buffy-white in color with stark black teardrop shaped spots. The belly is off-white, and the flanks have larger black spots. Its vent is buffy and an underwing that is buffy-white with darker markings. The iris is yellow, the bill is grayish-brown, and the legs are brown with a dull tint. Juveniles&#x27; plumage have not been recorded, but presumably is similar in development to adulthood like the long-billed and brown thrasher.

===Similar species===
The Cozumel thrasher is similar in appearance to the long-billed thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma longirostre&quot;, in length), but is smaller, darker in color, has a blacker bill, and the markings are more sharply defined. No other thrasher species coexist on the island, but the Cozumel thrasher may be confused with the migratory wood thrush (&quot;Hylocichla mustelina&quot;). The wood thrush differs in lacking wing bars, a shorter beak, and a different shape.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The distribution of the thrasher is restricted to Isla Cozumel which is 45 km long and 20 km wide.

The habitat preferences for the thrasher is thought to be in low and medium deciduous and semi-deciduous forests. It may have once been most abundant in forest edges adjacent to clearings.

==Behavior and ecology== 
The thrasher is predominately terrestrial and elusive and as with all members of the genus &quot;Toxostoma&quot;, it may resort to running instead of flying when startled. Ornithologists Ludlow Griscom and Raymond A. Paynter, Jr. had noted its secretive behavior, but James Bond did not.

The song is described as a rich varied warbling, slightly scratchy with little repetition. Bond described its alarm note being similar to the brown thrasher.

==Status==
The numbers of this bird declined rapidly when Hurricane Gilbert hit this island on September 14, 1988. Until it was sighted in June 2004, this bird had last been seen in 1995, the same year that Hurricane Roxanne hit Cozumel on October 11, and it was widely believed to have become extinct.

It is still unclear what damage the impact of Hurricanes Emily and Wilma in 2005 caused; it seems that the bird was not found anymore during a survey in December 2006.

Inquiry from the local population had suggested that the species would likely be encountered near the Mayan ruins of San Gervasio.

The last – unconfirmed – sightings were in April 2006, where an apparent &quot;T. guttatum&quot; was sighted at the Cozumel Golf Club; in October and December 2007, thrashers were also seen but could not be reliably identified as &quot;T. guttatum&quot;. Relocation efforts continue; though at least a few birds seem to survive, the continuing existence of this species had not been verified as of January 2008.

Some scientists believe that other factors must have contributed to the bird&#x27;s decline, because the Cozumel thrasher likely survived hurricanes for millennia. Introduced species, including predatory boa constrictors—which were released on the island in 1971 and are now abundant—may also have had a detrimental effect.

<text>Jörg Fauser (16 July 1944 – 17 July 1987) was a German writer, poet and journalist.

The influence of the American beat generation literature on his works is well known. Together with Carl Weissner and other colleagues he published several issues of the literature magazine Gasolin 23 which included work by William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and the first German translations of short stories by Charles Bukowski. His later works are mostly German detective stories. &quot;Der Schneemann&quot; has been made into . He died when a truck hit him while walking on a motorway near Munich. Fauser&#x27;s autobiographical novel, &quot;Rohstoff&quot;, a cutting look at the German counter-culture scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s, has been translated into English by Jamie Bulloch as &quot;Raw Material&quot; and published by Clerkenwell Press. His radio play &quot;Für eine Mark und Acht&quot; was adapted into the 1998 film &quot;Frankfurt Millennium&quot;.

<text>Thomas Chester Edwards (born November 24, 1951) is an American politician who was a United States Representative from Texas, representing a district based in Waco, from 1991 to 2011. Previously, he served in the Texas Senate from 1983 to 1990. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Edwards was on Barack Obama&#x27;s vice presidential shortlist in 2008.

==Early life and education==
A Waco resident, Edwards was born in Corpus Christi. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Texas A&amp;M University in 1974, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. One of his professors was future U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator Phil Gramm. Upon graduation, he received the Earl Rudder Award, which is given to two outstanding seniors. Edwards was the Chairman of the 18th MSC Student Conference on National Affairs Conference, where he helped to bring Vice President Walter Mondale and businessman Ross Perot to campus.

== Early career ==
After graduation, Edwards worked as an aide to Congressman Olin E. Teague for three years. This mentorship later influenced Edwards’ work in Congress on Veterans Affairs. When Teague announced his retirement in 1978, Edwards ran in the Democratic primary to succeed him. He lost by only 115 votes to his former professor, Phil Gramm, who switched to Republican affiliation in 1983.

In 1981, Edwards earned his MBA from Harvard Business School. He then went to work for the Trammell Crow Company as a commercial real estate agent. Later, Edwards purchased several rural radio stations in South Texas.

===Texas Senate===
Edwards was elected to the Texas Senate in 1983, and served until 1990, representing District 9. He was the youngest member at age 30. In the Texas Senate, Edwards was a member of the Senate Education Committee which oversaw class size reduction in public schools. He was also on the Health and Human Resources Committee, chaired the Senate Nominations Committee, the Texas Sunset Commission, a joint commission which reviews state agencies on a 12-year rotation, and the Texas Election Code Revision Committee. Edwards was also a member of the Committee on Business, Technology, and Education. He received the “Texas Business” award during the 68th Regular Session as one of three outstanding freshman legislators, and was named by &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; as one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Legislators&quot; during his tenure.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
**Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government
**Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (Chairman)
*Committee on the Budget

Edwards served as a member on the House Budget Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee and vice chair of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. He also chaired the House Army Caucus.
After becoming Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee in 2007, Edwards authored a $17.7 billion increase in funding for veterans health care and benefits, the largest increase in veterans funding in the history of the Veterans Administration. He also assisted in enacting the 21st Century GI Bill of Rights into law, covering the full cost of a college education for troops. In 2008, both the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars recognized Edwards&#x27; leadership with their national awards.
In 2007, he received the Marix Congressional Achievement Award from the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) in recognition of his work. In 2006, Edwards was honored with the Award of Merit, the highest award given by the Military Coalition, which represents 36 military and veteran groups. In 2003, the Association of the U.S. Army gave Edwards its &quot;Legislator of the Year Award.&quot; He was co-chair of the House Army Caucus for over a decade and served on the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees for six years before joining the Appropriations Committee.

==Political positions==

Edwards is a moderate Democrat according to a nonpartisan organization GovTrack. He was also a leader in the House of Representatives.

However, he has stated his opposition to caps on medical malpractice lawsuits. He voted for the Iraq Resolution.

===Fiscal policy===
Edwards opposed the 2001 federal tax cuts and voted against eliminating the marriage penalty and estate tax. He voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

In 2001, he opposed cuts of $100 million to the nuclear non-proliferation budget proposed by the Bush administration. Serving as a member on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Edwards oversaw homeland defense and university research programs to protect Americans from the threat of nuclear terrorism. Edwards supported the implementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and, in 2003, helped secure $84 million to install radiological detectors at the busiest foreign ports so nuclear materials could be detected overseas before reaching America.
Edwards is known as a fiscal conservative. The non-partisan Concord Coalition gave him its &quot;Deficit Hawk&quot; Award. His pro-economic, pro-agriculture record also earned him endorsements from both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Farm Bureau Friends of Agriculture Fund (AGFUND). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave him their &quot;Spirit of Enterprise&quot; Award for several years for his support of business. Edwards voted with the NRA 100% on gun rights issues for many years and received the NRA&#x27;s endorsement.

===Social policy===
Edwards traditionally votes against same-sex marriage. He has voted in favor of Constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, as well as to define marriage one-man-one-woman, and holds a 25% rating from the Human Rights Campaign. Edwards voted against ending preferential treatment by race in college admissions and received an 83% rating from the NAACP in 2006. Edwards has received an &quot;A&quot; by the NRA Political Victory Fund.

Edwards supported increased access to health care for children of working families under the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). Edwards was honored by the Baptist Joint Committee, and earned the Walter Cronkite Award from the Interfaith Alliance for his principled stand to keep government regulations out of churches and houses of worship. He also received the T.B. Maston Christian Ethics Award.

==Political campaigns==
Edwards was elected to the U.S. House in 1990 with 54 percent of the vote in what was then the 11th District, defeating Republican Hugh Shine. He was re-elected in 1992 with 67 percent of the vote, defeating Republican James Broyles. He defeated Broyles again in 1994 with 59 percent of the vote.

During the 1990s, like much of rural Texas, the 11th District trended increasingly Republican. Edwards was able to hold onto his seat, though with shrinking margins. In 1996, he was re-elected with 57 percent of the vote against Republican Jay Mathis. He won in 1998 without any Republican opponent. In 2000 he won with 55 percent of the vote over Ramsey Farley; in 2002, he beat Farley again, this time with 52 percent of the vote. In 2000, he became President Bush&#x27;s congressman; the district includes Prairie Chapel Ranch just outside Crawford, which was Bush&#x27;s legal residence during his presidential term.

As part of the 2003 Texas redistricting, Edwards&#x27; district was renumbered as the 17th District and radically altered. The ethnically diverse cities of Temple and Killeen were removed, as was the Army post of Fort Hood. In their place, his district absorbed College Station, home to Texas A&amp;M and a long-standing bastion of conservatism. It also absorbed some heavily Republican territory near Fort Worth. While Edwards&#x27; old district had been trending Republican for some time, the new district was, on paper, one of the most Republican districts in the country. Edwards defeated conservative State Representative Arlene Wohlgemuth in November 2004 by 9,260 votes, or approximately a 3.8% margin. Proving just how Republican the new 17th district was, Bush carried it with a staggering 70 percent of the vote—the most of any Democratic-held district, and Bush&#x27;s 17th-best district in the entire country. Edwards was one of two Democrats to represent a significant portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in Congress, along with Eddie Bernice Johnson. In much of the district, Edwards was the only elected Democrat above the county level. It was generally understood that he would be succeeded by a Republican when he retired.

In 2006, Edwards ran for reelection against Republican Van Taylor, a former Marine Corps reservist and Iraq War veteran, and was re-elected with 58% of the vote to Taylor&#x27;s 40%.
On February 18, 2008, Edwards officially endorsed Barack Obama in the Texas March 4 Democratic primary. In late June 2008, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi publicly suggested that Edwards would be a great choice as Obama&#x27;s vice-presidential running mate. Edwards stated that he would accept such an offer from Obama. On August 22, the Associated Press reported that Edwards was on Obama&#x27;s short-list as a potential running-mate.

===2008===

In November 2008, Edwards was reelected, defeating Republican Rob Curnock, a Waco video business owner, with 53 percent of the vote. John McCain carried the 17th with 67 percent of the vote.

===2010===

Edwards was challenged by Republican nominee Bill Flores, a retired Bryan oil and gas executive.

Edwards was endorsed by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; and the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;.

Nate Silver in the FiveThirtyEight.com &quot;New York Times&quot; blog predicted that there was a 4.7% chance that Edwards would defeat Flores. Real Clear Politics rated this race &quot;Likely Republican&quot;.

On November 2, 2010, Edwards was heavily defeated, taking 37 percent of the vote to Flores&#x27;s 62 percent. He lost his home county of McLennan. This was the largest margin of defeat for a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 cycle. Edwards&#x27;s term ended on January 3, 2011.

==Personal life==
Since leaving Congress in 2011, Edwards has established Edwards, Davis Stover &amp; Associates, LLC with his former chief of staff, Lindsey Davis Stover, and continues to be involved with veterans issues in the Washington, D.C. area through his work on the boards of the Military Child Education Coalition and the Arlington National Cemetery Advisory Commission. He is married to Lea Ann Wood from Paducah, Kentucky. They have two sons, J.T. and Garrison. He was raised a Methodist.

<text>Fiber simulation is a branch of mechanics that deals with modeling the dynamics and rheology of fibers, i.e. particles of large aspect ratio length to diameter. Fiber simulations are used to gain a better understanding of production processes including fibers (textile and paper industry), biological systems or computer graphics.

== Modeling fibers ==
Many of the models used to simulate fibers were developed by researchers in the field of rheology. Rheologically speaking fiber suspensions are non-Newtonian fluids, and can display normal stress differences.

== Simulation techniques ==
Early fiber simulations employed particles which were rigid rods or prolate spheroids, whose equations of motion have analytical solutions. More recent models are able to represent flexible fibers. The models rely heavily on continuum mechanics concepts and the numerical methods employed have some similarities to those employed in molecular dynamics, or in dynamics of multi body systems.

The use of computers facilitates greatly the solution of fiber simulation problems. The complexity of the simulations arise from the system having a large number of degrees of freedom, and from the numerous possible interparticle interactions having place, such as friction, hydrodynamic interactions, and other kinds of interparticle forces such as colloidal forces that exert attractive or repulsive forces.

<text>Robert Gernhardt (13 December 1937 – 30 June 2006) was a German writer, painter, graphic artist and poet.

==Life==
Robert Gernhardt was born the son of a judge and a chemist in Tallinn, where his family was part of the Baltic German minority. In 1939 they had to relocate to Poznań. In 1945 his father was killed in the war, and after the end of the war, his mother fled west with her three sons Robert, Per, and Andreas, finally ending up in Göttingen, where Robert Gernhardt finished school in 1956.

Afterwards, he studied painting, first in Stuttgart and then at the Hochschule der Künste in Berlin, also doing German Studies at Berlin&#x27;s Freie Universität.

Beginning in 1964, he lived in Frankfurt, working as a freelance artist and writer. In 1965 he married his first wife, Almut Gernhardt, née Ulrich, who died in 1989. In 1990 he married his second wife, Almut Gehebe.

Since purchasing a house in Tuscany in 1972, he regularly spent many months in Italy.

In 1996 he had to undergo a multiple bypass operation and, in 2002, he was diagnosed with Colorectal cancer, which he succumbed to in 2006.

== Work ==
Robert Gernhardt was a regular contributor to the satirical magazine &quot;pardon&quot;, where he edited the section &quot;Welt im Spiegel&quot; (&quot;World in the Mirror&quot;) with F. K. Waechter and F. W. Bernstein, using the pseudonym &quot;Lützel Jeman&quot; until 1971.

Gernhardt co-founded the satirical magazine &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1979. He was a member of the so-called Neue Frankfurter Schule (New Frankfurt School) together with artists like Waechter, , and . Gernhardt&#x27;s satirical style combines social critique with a self-consciously irreverential attitude to cultural and literary traditions.

His poetry and prose are situated within the comic traditions of Wilhelm Busch, Christian Morgenstern and the urban poetry of Heinrich Heine and Bertolt Brecht. Gernhardt&#x27;s poems, which frequently produce their comic effects through play with language and sound as well as through playfully quoting literary tradition, have become part of public consciousness in Germany.

During the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, he wrote material for Otto Waalkes, one of Germany&#x27;s most popular comedians. A lot of Waalkes&#x27; most famous routines were written by Gernhardt, often in collaboration with and .

In 2006, shortly before his death, he was the Writer in Residence at the German department of the University of Warwick.

He died on 30 June 2006 in Frankfurt am Main, after a long fight against cancer, aged 68.

In 2009 a CD-ROM with the title: &quot;der ton im wörtersee&quot; was published in the German language.

==Awards==
He won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1983 and the Kassel Literary Prize in 1991. He won the Bertolt-Brecht-Literaturpreis in 1998, and the Rheingau Literatur Preis in 2002. In 2004 he was awarded the Heinrich Heine Prize, and in 2006, the Wilhelm Busch Prize.

The state-owned bank Helaba is sponsoring an award named after Gernhardt.

<doc id="833746" wikidata="Q2932227" url="?curid=833746" title="Distinguished Service Order (Vietnam)">
<text>The Army Distinguished Service Order (), Air Force Distinguished Service Order (), and Navy Distinguished Service Order () was a military decoration of South Vietnam which was awarded throughout the years of the Vietnam War. The decoration was bestowed for meritorious or heroic deeds related to wartime operations and was awarded for both combat and non-combat service.

There were two classes of the Army/Air Force/Navy Distinguished Service Order, the first class being for officers and the second class for enlisted personnel. The first class of the order was differentiated by a blossom device centered on the medal and ribbon.

The Army/Air Force/Navy Distinguished Service Order was also provided to foreign militaries, and in the United States military the decoration was considered the equivalent of the Legion of Merit. For foreign officers, the 2nd class of the order was also provided to officers.

The decoration ranked immediately below the National Order of the Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal. It was among the less commonly bestowed medals, in contrast to such decorations as the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross and Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

The last issuance of the Vietnam Distinguished Service Order was in 1974, before the Fall of Saigon.

==Criteria==
The Army/Air Force/Navy Distinguished Service Order is awarded or posthumously awarded to RVN Army/Air Force/Navy Officers who meet one of the following requirements: 
*Have been cited or wounded many times in combat or in line of duty.
*Have accomplished exceptionally important achievements that reflect great credit on, or is beneficial to the RVN Army/Air Force/Navy in any field. 
The Army/Air Force/Navy Distinguished Service Order is also intended for Army/Air Force/Navy units and General Officers in other armed services, who have accomplished an achievement that is exceptionally important and beneficial to the Republic of Vietnam Army/Air Force/Navy.

<text>The Downing Professorship of Medicine was one of the senior professorships in medicine at the University of Cambridge.

The chair was founded in 1800 as a bequest of Sir George Downing, the founder of Downing College, Cambridge. The original electors were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, and the masters of the colleges of Clare, St John&#x27;s and Downing.

The chair was discontinued on the death of its final holder in 1930.

<text>Helmut Flieg was a German writer, known by his pseudonym Stefan Heym (). He lived in the United States and trained at Camp Ritchie in 1943, making him one of the Ritchie Boys of World War II. In 1952, he returned to his home to the part of his native Germany which was, from 1949 to 1990, the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. He published works in English and German at home and abroad, and despite longstanding criticism of the GDR remained a committed socialist. He was awarded the 1953 Heinrich Mann Prize, the 1959 National Prize of East Germany (2nd class), and the 1993 Jerusalem Prize.

==Biography==

=== Early years===
Flieg, born to a Jewish merchant family in Chemnitz, was an antifascist from an early age. In 1931, he was, at the instigation of local Nazis, expelled from the Gymnasium in his home town because of an anti-military poem. He completed school in Berlin, and began a degree in media studies there. After the 1933 Reichstag fire, he fled to Czechoslovakia, where he took the name Stefan Heym.

In Czechoslovakia, the only remaining democracy in Central Europe at that time, he worked for German newspapers published in Prague such as &quot;Prager Tagblatt&quot; and &quot;Bohemia&quot; and also managed to have some of his articles published in translation by Czech newspapers. During this time he signed his articles under several pseudonyms, including Melchior Douglas, Gregor Holm and Stefan Heym.

===United States===
In 1935, he received a grant from a Jewish student association, and went to the United States to continue his degree at the University of Chicago, which he completed in 1936 with a dissertation on Heinrich Heine. Between 1937 and 1939 he was based in New York as Editor-in-Chief of the German-language weekly &quot;Deutsches Volksecho&quot;, which was close to the Communist Party of the USA. After the newspaper ceased publication in November 1939, Heym worked as a freelance author in English, and achieved a bestseller with his first novel, &quot;Hostages&quot; (1942).

From 1943, Heym (who had become a U.S. citizen), contributed to the World War II war effort. He was a member of the Ritchie Boys, a unit for psychological warfare under the command of émigré Hans Habe. His work consisted of composing texts designed to influence Wehrmacht soldiers, to be disseminated by leaflet, radio and loudspeaker. These experiences formed the background for a later novel, &quot;The Crusaders&quot;, and were the basis for &quot;Reden an den Feind&quot; (&quot;Speeches to the Enemy&quot;), a collection of those texts.

After the war Heym led the &quot;Ruhrzeitung&quot; in Essen, and then became editor in Munich of &quot;Die Neue Zeitung&quot;, one of the most important newspapers of the American occupying forces. Because of his refusal to soften his critical stance toward Nazism and the German elites that had collaborated with it and his refusal to begin to discreetly weave doubts about Soviet intentions into his editorials, Heym was transferred back to the U.S. toward the end of 1945 and in 1951, fearing investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee as the hunt for Communists led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy reached a crescendo, Heym left the United States with his American wife, Gertrude Gelbin, whom he married in 1944.

In the following years he worked as a freelance author once again. In 1952 he gave all his American military commendations back in protest against the Korean War and moved first to Prague, then in the following year to the German Democratic Republic, after the GDR government had restored his former German citizenship.

===GDR===

In the GDR, Heym initially received privileged treatment as a returning antifascist emigre. He lived with his wife in a state-provided villa in Berlin-Grünau. Between 1953 and 1956, he worked at the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot;, thereafter primarily as a freelance author. In the early years of his life in the GDR, Heym supported the regime with socialist novels and other works. Heym&#x27;s works, which he continued to write in English, were published by a publishing house founded for him (Seven Seas Publishers). In German, translations were printed in large numbers.

Conflicts with the GDR authorities became apparent from 1956 on, as despite the destalinisation of the leadership, the publication of Heym&#x27;s book on the June 17, 1953, uprising, &quot;Five Days in June&quot;, was rejected. Tensions increased after 1965, when Erich Honecker attacked Heym during an SED party conference. In 1969, Heym was convicted of breaching the exchange control regulations after publishing his novel &quot;Lassalle&quot; in West Germany. He was nonetheless able to leave the GDR on foreign trips, such as his two-month visit to the U.S. in 1978, and his books continued to appear, albeit in lower print runs, in the GDR.

In 1976, Heym was among those GDR authors who signed the petition protesting against the exile of Wolf Biermann. From this point on Heym could only publish his works in the West, and he began composing works in German. In 1979, he was again convicted of breaching exchange controls and excluded from the GDR Authors Association. Heym expressed support for German reunification as early as 1982, and during the 1980s supported the civil rights movement in the GDR, contributing a number of speeches to the East Berlin demonstrations in autumn 1989.
===After reunification===

In the years after reunification, Heym was critical of what he saw as the discrimination against East Germans in their integration into the Federal Republic, and argued for a socialist alternative to the capitalism of the reunited Germany. At the 1994 German federal election, Heym stood as an independent on the Open List of the then Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), but won direct election to the Bundestag by winning the seat of Berlin-Mitte/Prenzlauer Berg (discontinued after 1998, Berlin-Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg – Prenzlauer Berg East being one successor).

As President by right of age of the Bundestag he held the opening speech of the new Parliament in November 1994, but resigned in October 1995 in protest against a planned constitutional amendment raising MP expense allowances. In 1997, he was among the signers of the &quot;Erfurt Declaration&quot;, demanding a red-green alliance (between SPD and Greens) to form a minority government supported by the PDS to end the 16 year reign of Chancellor Kohl after the 1998 German federal election (which saw a decisive SPD win with a stable red-green majority). 

Heym died suddenly of heart failure in Ein Bokek in Israel whilst attending a Heinrich Heine Conference. He was honoured with honorary doctorates from the University of Bern (1990) and University of Cambridge (1991), and honorary citizenship of Chemnitz, his birthplace (2001). He was also awarded the Jerusalem Prize (1993) for literature &#x27;for the freedom of the individual in society&#x27;, and the peace medal of the IPPNW. Previously he had won the Heinrich-Mann-Prize (1953), and the National Prize of the GDR, 2nd class (1959). He died in 2001, aged 88, and was buried in the Weißensee Cemetery.

<text>Tench Coxe (May 22, 1755July 17, 1824) was an American political economist and a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress in 1788–1789. He wrote under the pseudonym &quot;A Pennsylvanian,&quot; and was known to his political enemies as &quot;Mr. Facing Bothways.&quot;

==Biography==
Coxe was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 22, 1755. His mother was a daughter of Tench Francis Sr. His father came of a family well known in American affairs. His great-grandfather was the governor of West Jersey, Daniel Coxe.

Tench received his education in the Philadelphia schools and intended to study law, but his father determined to make him a merchant, and he was placed in the counting-house of Coxe &amp; Furman, becoming a partner at the age of twenty-one.

After Patriots took power, Coxe left Philadelphia for a few months, only to return when British General Howe occupied the city in September 1777. Coxe remained in Philadelphia after the British departed in 1778, and some Patriots accused him of having Royalist sympathies and of having served (briefly) in the British army. Coxe&#x27;s trading successes during the period of British occupation lent considerable support to the charges, and he was arrested; although nothing came of the allegations and he was pardoned. The Pennsylvania militia records of 1780, 1787, and 1788 listed Coxe as a militia private. Of the militia, Coxe wrote,

Coxe became a Whig and began a long political career. In 1786 he was sent to the Annapolis Convention and in 1788 to the Continental Congress. In September of 1787, Coxe wrote three articles published in the Independent Gazetteer (Philadelphia) with the name “An American Citizen” examining the newly minted U.S. Constitution with a focus on the Presidency and the two houses of Congress and contrasting it – favorably – to the British Constitution.

Coxe next became a Federalist. A proponent of industrialization during the early years of the United States, Coxe co-authored the famous &quot;Report on Manufactures&quot; (1791) with Alexander Hamilton, providing much of the statistical data. He had been appointed Assistant Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789, under Alexander Hamilton when Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury. Coxe also headed a group called the Manufacturing Society of Philadelphia. He was appointed revenue commissioner by President George Washington on June 30, 1792, and served until removed by President John Adams. In 1796, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Coxe then turned Democratic-Republican, and in the canvass of 1800 published Adams&#x27; famous letter to him regarding Pinckney. For this he was reviled by the federalists as a renegade, a tory, and a British guide, and President Thomas Jefferson rewarded him by an appointment as Purveyor of Public Supplies; he served from 1803 to 1812.

In 1804 Coxe organized and led a group at Philadelphia opposed to the election to congress of Michael Leib, and this brought him again into public notice. Though a Democratic-Republican, he was for three months daily abused by the &quot;Aurora&quot;. He was called a tory, a Federal rat, a British guide who had entered Philadelphia in 1777 with laurel in his hat, and his group was nicknamed the &quot;quids.&quot; The term is commonly supposed to have been first applied to the little band led by John Randolph in 1806, but this is a mistake.

Coxe was a writer on political and economic subjects and a champion of tariffs to protect the new nation&#x27;s growing industries. He wrote also on naval power, on encouragement of arts and manufactures, on the cost, trade, and manufacture of cotton, on the navigation act, and on arts and manufactures in the United States. He deserves, indeed, to be called the father of the American cotton industry. He was the first to attempt to bring an Arkwright machine to the United States, the first to urge Southerners to raise cotton. Coxe also acquired vast acreage of Pennsylvania timber and coal lands. This investment in lands though not much developed in Tench Coxe lifetime was the basis of wealth for his descendants.

Coxe died July 17, 1824, in Philadelphia, where he is interred in Christ Church Burial Ground.

His grandson Colonel Frank Coxe built Battery Park Hotel in Asheville, North Carolina and bought Green River Plantation in Polk County, North Carolina. His grandson, Eckley Coxe, founded MMI Preparatory School in Freeland, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="833773" wikidata="Q378753" url="?curid=833773" title="Dmitry Pisarev">
<text>Dmitry Ivanovich Pisarev ( – ) was a Russian literary critic and philosopher who was a central figure of Russian nihilism. He is noted as a forerunner of Nietzschean philosophy, and for the impact his advocacy of liberation movements and natural science had on Russian history.

A critique of his philosophy became the subject of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s celebrated novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. Indeed, Pisarev&#x27;s philosophy embraces the nihilist aims of negation and value-destruction; in freeing oneself from all human and moral authority, the nihilist becomes ennobled above the common masses and free to act according to sheer personal preference and usefulness. These &quot;new types&quot;, as Pisarev termed them, were to be pioneers of what he saw as the most necessary step for human development, namely the reset and destruction of the existing mode of thought. Among his most famous locutions is: &quot;What can be smashed must be smashed. Whatever withstands the blow is fit to survive; what flies into pieces is rubbish. In any case, strike out right and left, no harm can come of it.&quot;

Pisarev wrote most of his works while imprisoned. He was arrested for political crimes the year after graduating university and drowned only two years after his release, aged 27. It is unknown whether his death was accidental or suicide as he had also suffered severe mental health issues throughout his life. His works had a deep influence throughout Russia on revolutionaries such as Lenin, anti-nihilists such as Dostoevsky, and scientists such as the Nobel Prize winner Ivan Pavlov.

== Biography ==

Dmitry Pisarev was born in Znamenskoye in the west of the Russian Empire, into a family of the landed aristocracy. He graduated from a gymnasium in Saint Petersburg in 1856, and in the same year began studying history and philology at Saint Petersburg Imperial University. He began writing as a literary critic for a women&#x27;s liberal journal called &quot;Rassavet&quot; in 1858 while he was still a student. From 1859 to 1860 he suffered a severe mental breakdown and attempted suicide at least twice. He was committed to a mental asylum for four months after which he resumed his work and studies. As a critic, he came into contact with the writings of radicals such as Nikolay Dobrolyubov and Nikolay Chernyshevsky, as well as their mentors and followers. He became enthralled with this modern wave of literature, stating that it &quot;forced me out of my confined cell into the fresh air.&quot; He graduated in 1861, the same year as serfdom was abolished and the first major student demonstrations were held in Saint Petersburg, by which time he had thoroughly adopted the nihilist outlook and abandoned his Orthodox Christian faith.

After graduation he worked as editor for various publications. He was arrested in 1862 for anti-government writings and was imprisoned until 1866. After his release, he continued his literary work.

During the summer holidays of 1868 he died as a result of a drowning accident at Dubulti on the Gulf of Riga (in present-day Latvia).

== Legacy ==
Pisarev was one of the writers who propelled the democratic-revolutionary trend in Russia during the 1860s. The next generation of Russians, made famous by the events of 1905 and 1917, acknowledged Pisarev&#x27;s influence. Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin&#x27;s wife, once wrote, &quot;Lenin was of the generation that grew up under the influence of Pisarev&quot;.

Pisarev was also noted for his support of Russian natural science, particularly biology, and his works greatly influenced the career choice of the young Ivan Pavlov. He considered himself a positivist, although his incorporation of imagination and style somewhat contradicted that school of thought. He did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were &quot;an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position.&quot; He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

Pisarev wanted, more than anything else, for his readers to learn to think independently. This desire he pursued through philosophy, literary criticism and social and family analyses.

=== Influence on Lenin ===

Lenin, in the fifth chapter of &quot;What Is To Be Done?&quot;, quoted these lines from an article by Pisarev:

<doc id="833777" wikidata="Q61994" url="?curid=833777" title="Wolfgang Hohlbein">
<text>Wolfgang Hohlbein (born 15 August 1953) is a German writer of science fiction, fantasy and horror fiction. His wife, Heike Hohlbein, is also a writer and they frequently collaborate. With more than 200 published books and more than 43 million sold copies he is considered one of the most successful German writers in the fantasy genre.

==Personal life==
Wolfgang Hohlbein was born on 15 August 1953 in Weimar, Bezirk Erfurt. After finishing school, he took an apprenticeship as industrial clerk, a profession he then worked in for the following years. To bolster his income, he also worked as night watchman. It was during this period when he started to write his early works, to pass the time faster. In 1971 he met his wife Heike, whom he would marry three years later. Together they raised six children, including Rebecca Hohlbein (*1977), who would become an author as well. In 1982 he quit his job to work as a full-time author. Shortly after, he and his family moved to his wife&#x27;s birth town of Neuss, North Rhine-Westphalia, where they live to this day.

In 2014 the German TV channel RTL II launched a reality show called &quot;Die Hohlbeins – Eine total fantastische Familie&quot; (&quot;The Hohlbein&#x27;s, a fantastic family&quot;), which aimed to show the life of the Hohlbein family in the a docusoap format. The show garnered about 910,000 viewers during the first episode, but after a fast drop-off in viewers and negative criticism of being too trivial and boring it was cancelled soon after.

==Work==

Writing short stories since a young age, Hohlbein was first recognized as an author after sending in a manuscript he and his wife had written at a fantasy and science fiction writing contest in 1982. They won and their book, &quot;Märchenmond&quot; (English title: &quot;Magic Moon&quot;), was published by &quot;Ueberreuter Verlag&quot;, soon becoming a bestseller and winning several awards. In the following years the Hohlbein&#x27;s wrote two sequels to the book, continuing their success. The trilogy remains their greatest success until today and sold more than 2 million copies. He&#x27;s also a writer of pulp fiction, including the series &quot;Der Hexer&quot; (The Warlock), which he conceived in 1984 for the magazine &quot;Gespenster-Krimi&quot; (Ghost Thriller) published by Bastei Lübbe, mainly based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, and of which he wrote the majority of novels initially under the collective pen name of Robert Craven. Later the series was reedited and republished as paperbacks, which collected the stories of several pulp magazines, including a prequel, and as e-books both under Hohlbein&#x27;s own name.

Hohlbein primarily writes in the genre of fantasy, horror and historical fiction. Since the success of &quot;Märchenmond&quot; Hohlbein had published more than 200 books. He sometimes cooperates with other authors like Dieter Winkler or his daughter Rebecca Hohlbein. His most important source of inspiration is his wife Heike Hohlbein, who is credited as co-author on more than 30 of his books. In his early days, Hohlbein also wrote a lot of paperback stories for various magazines and also often used a pseudonym. Later he focused more on stand-alone novels as well as some long-running book series, like the &quot;Enwor&quot; saga or the still not finished &quot;Chronik der Unsterblichen&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the Immortals&quot;).

Apart from his own creations, Hohlbein also wrote various tie-in books for such franchises as &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;.

==Reception==

Wolfgang Hohlbein is among the most successful and prolific German fantasy authors. He has written more than 200 books and sold more than 43 million issues throughout his career.

Many of his books are translated and published internationally in various European countries as well as outside of Europe in countries such as South Korea. For many years none of his works had been translated into English, not even the eight Indiana Jones novels he wrote. His only works to be translated into English were his three &quot;Märchenmond novels&quot;, which were published by Tokyopop from 2006 onwards, now titled &quot;Magic Moon&quot;.

Hohlbein&#x27;s books also have been adapted into other media such as radioplays. His work &quot;Märchenmond&quot; was translated into a theatre play, which has been presented in places like the &quot;Westfälisches Landestheater&quot; or the &quot;Theater für Niedersachsen&quot;. The German progressive metal band, Vanden Plas, recorded and consecutively released two full-length albums, &quot;Chronicles of the Immortals – Netherworld (Path One)&quot; in 2014 and &quot;Chronicles of the Immortals – Netherworld II&quot; in 2015, that were adapted from &quot;Blutnacht,&quot; a theater production based on the author&#x27;s &quot;Die Chronik der Unsterblichen.&quot;

Throughout the years, various propositions have been made to turn some of his works into film, for example for &quot;Das Druidentor&quot; or &quot;Azrael&quot;, but none of these projects were realized.
In September 2016 however, Constantin Film announced they will create a feature film based on his book &quot;Hagen von Tronje&quot;.

In 2020 Sony released a film called &quot;The Magic Kids: Three Unlikely Heroes&quot;, based on his book series &quot;Die Wolf-Gäng&quot;, about Vlad the vampire who moves to a new magical town and a special magical school, three of the year 7 children team up together as they all have their own problems - a fairy who is afraid of heights, a werewolf who is allergic to fur, and a vampire who can&#x27;t stand blood. They soon discover that the town is controlled by a demon who is after one thing - a magical crystal that has been left by Vlad&#x27;s mother that could bring back dark magical times if used improperly.

<text>On April 28, 1905, William H. Pickering, who had discovered the Saturnian moon Phoebe seven years earlier, announced the discovery of a tenth Saturnian satellite, which he promptly named [[Themis]] after the Greek goddess of divine law and order. The thirteen photographic plates on which it supposedly appeared spanned a period between April 17 and July 8, 1904. No other astronomer ever confirmed Pickering&#x27;s claim. 

Pickering attempted to compute an orbit, which showed a fairly high inclination (39.1° to the ecliptic), fairly large eccentricity (0.23) and a semi-major axis () slightly less than that of Hyperion. The period was supposedly 20.85 days, with prograde motion.

Pickering estimated Themis&#x27; diameter at 38 miles (61 km), based on his assumptions that Themis&#x27; albedo was the same as Titan&#x27;s, and that Titan&#x27;s diameter was about 2300 miles. Today, Titan&#x27;s diameter is known to be closer to 3200 miles. The same assumptions led him to a diameter of 42 miles (68 km) for Phoebe, far less than Phoebe&#x27;s true diameter of roughly 132 miles (213 km).

In April 1861, Hermann Goldschmidt had also believed that he had discovered a new satellite of Saturn between Titan and Hyperion, which he called Chiron. It does not exist, though the name was used much later for the comet/asteroid 2060 Chiron.

Pickering was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1906 for his &quot;discovery of the ninth and tenth satellites of Saturn&quot;.

The actual tenth satellite of Saturn (in order of discovery) was Janus, which was discovered in 1966 and confirmed in 1980.

==In fiction==
Philip Latham (pen-name of Robert S. Richardson), in his novel &quot;Missing Men of Saturn&quot;, has Themis collide with Titan, &quot;getting rid of the little nuisance once and for all&quot;, according to the introduction.

John Varley&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Titan&quot; is set aboard an expedition to Saturn. During the novel, as they approach the planet and prepare to enter orbit, the astronomer onboard discovers a new moon. At first she believes she has recovered Pickering&#x27;s lost moon, so she names it Themis.

Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat trilogy of novels makes frequent reference to Pickering&#x27;s Moon as a satellite that revolves the &quot;wrong way&quot; (i. e. retrograde) around its primary. Likewise, the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; asks in the novel: &quot;Why does Pickering&#x27;s Moon go about in reverse orbit?&quot;

Nelson S. Bond, in his 1943 science-fiction story &quot;The Ordeal of Lancelot Biggs,&quot; explains that Themis periodically disappears when it is occulted by its own moon, an invisible body with &quot;the peculiar property of being able to warp light waves around itself&quot;.

<text>Augustus Owsley Stanley III (January 19, 1935 – March 12, 2011) was an American-Australian audio engineer and clandestine chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the decade&#x27;s counterculture.

Under the professional name Bear, he was the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, recording many of the band&#x27;s live performances. Stanley also developed the Grateful Dead&#x27;s Wall of Sound, one of the largest mobile sound reinforcement systems ever constructed. Stanley also helped Robert Thomas design the band&#x27;s trademark skull logo.

Called the Acid King by the media, Stanley was the first known private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD. By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced at least 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses.

He died in a car accident in Australia (where he had taken citizenship in 1996) on March 12, 2011.

==Ancestry==
Stanley was the scion of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His paternal grandfather, Augustus Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.

==Biography==
===Early life===
When he was fifteen, Owsley spent fifteen months as a voluntary psychiatric patient in St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. Without having graduated from high school, he was admitted to the University of Virginia, where he studied engineering for a year. Despite maintaining a 3.4 grade point average with minimal effort, he dropped out because of his disinclination for slide rules and mechanical drawing. Despite his dearth of formal education, he secured a position as a test engineer with Rocketdyne in Los Angeles; in this capacity, he worked on the SM-64 Navaho supersonic cruise missile. In June 1956, he enlisted in the United States Air Force as an electronics specialist, serving for 18 months (including stints at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Edwards Air Force Base&#x27;s Rocket Engine Test Facility) before being discharged in 1958. During his service, he secured an amateur radio license and a general radiotelephone operator license.

Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer. In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD, which was not illegal at the time as its classification as a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. did not occur until 1968.

Stanley returned to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965, and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.

In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD sold under the trade-name Delysid was hard to come by, as Sandoz halted LSD production in August 1965 after growing governmental protests at its proliferation among the general populace, which meant that &quot;Owsley Acid&quot; had become the new standard. He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968), Tom Wolfe&#x27;s book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966, with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.

Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967), and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron&#x27;s band free LSD.

===Involvement with the Grateful Dead===
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965. He both financed them and worked with them as their first sound engineer. Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the band&#x27;s iconic &#x27;Steal Your Face&#x27; lightning bolt-skull logo. The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: &quot;One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn&#x27;t read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment.&quot;

During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his &quot;sonic journals&quot; was to improve his ability to mix the sound, but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s. Another reason for the first recordings was that Stanley had hearing damage in one ear from a swimming-pool diving accident when he was 19, and wanted a way to check himself. His cassette recordings of shows also proved useful for the band to review post-show and critique their performances.

In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old &amp; In the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.

Live albums recorded by Owsley Stanley include &quot;Bear&#x27;s Choice&quot; by the Grateful Dead, &quot;Old &amp; In the Way&quot; by the bluegrass group of the same name, &quot;Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969&quot; by the Flying Burrito Brothers, and &quot;Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968&quot; by Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin. Also, a number of Grateful Dead archival releases, including several of the &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks&quot; and &quot;Dave&#x27;s Picks&quot; series and other titles, were recorded by him. Additionally, the &quot;Bear&#x27;s Sonic Journals&quot; series of live albums (see below) feature various musical artists recorded by Stanley.

===Richmond LSD lab===
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (a skilled chemist and Cargill family scion who became Stanley&#x27;s girlfriend following an introduction by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed &quot;White Lightning&quot;. When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.

In Denver, the trio was augmented by fellow Berkeley student Rhoney Gissen, who joined the manufacturing effort and began a relationship with Stanley (concurrent with Stanley&#x27;s relationship with Cargill and Cargill&#x27;s separate relationship with Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady) that endured through the early 1970s; although they never married, Gissen would eventually take Stanley&#x27;s surname. Stanley&#x27;s scientific tutelage influenced Gissen&#x27;s decision to return to her formal studies and pursue the profession of dentistry; their son, Starfinder, would go on to earn zoology and veterinary medicine degrees from Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania.

===Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead===
A psychedelic known as STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet). Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of that was confiscated by the police.

In late 1967, Stanley&#x27;s lab at La Espiral, Orinda, California, was raided by police and he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to &quot;Owsley Stanley&quot;. After his release from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 a.m., 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel after returning from a concert at The Warehouse in New Orleans.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, everyone in the band except Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan and Tom Constanten—neither of whom used psychedelic drugs—was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge &quot;State Times&quot;, Stanley identified himself to the police as &quot;The King of Acid&quot; and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song &quot;Truckin&#x27; &quot; is based on the incident (&quot;Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won&#x27;t let you be&quot;).

Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 conviction. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity in jail to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.

Immediately following his release in the summer of 1972, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer. Since his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his time in prison, he struggled to regain his past influence with the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received &quot;just a taste&quot; of his previous position: &quot;I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability.&quot; The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band&#x27;s physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as &quot;macho cowboys&quot;, in contrast to Stanley&#x27;s diminutive stature and scholarly demeanor.

The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at an October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University, at which students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absent Matthews absconded with half of the band&#x27;s PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.

Although Stanley stopped touring with the Grateful Dead following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the band. In 1973, he served as lead designer of the band&#x27;s Wall of Sound, collaborating with Dan Healy and Mark Raizene, as well as Rick Turner and John Curl of Alembic, to design the ground-breaking sound reinforcement system. During that period, Stanley also assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for &quot;Steal Your Face&quot; (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom. Following the hiatus, Stanley returned as Lesh&#x27;s personal roadie for &quot;a couple of tours&quot; in the late 1970s, although personality conflicts with other crew members once again precipitated his departure.

===Post–Grateful Dead career===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the live mixing engineer for Robert Hunter and Jefferson Starship. From 1974 to 1981, he also grew and sold cannabis from his garden in Fairfax, California, but the profits from this endeavor proved to be far less remunerative than his earlier work in clandestine chemistry. Stanley moved to Australia in 1982, and frequently returned to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours. He retained backstage access during this period, and his clientele included such notable figures as Keith Richards.

Stanley&#x27;s level of access to the group&#x27;s inner echelon (including complimentary food from the band&#x27;s caterers) was somewhat controversial among the band&#x27;s employees, with one staffer opining that &quot;he had the sales tactics of a Mumbai street peddler&quot;; on one occasion, Garcia and Weir were forced to intervene when Stanley provoked Chelsea Clinton&#x27;s Secret Service detail as he attempted to conduct business with the then-First Daughter.

Notwithstanding his tour activities, Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.

==Personal life and death==

Stanley believed a &quot;thermal cataclysm&quot; related to climate change would soon render the Northern Hemisphere largely uninhabitable, and moved to Australia in 1982. He became a naturalized Australian citizen in 1996. Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah (a former clerk in the Grateful Dead&#x27;s ticket office) in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture and wearable art.

From at least the mid-1960s until his death, Stanley practiced and advocated an all-meat diet, believing that humans are naturally carnivorous. He argued that rare red meat was a complete food and that a diet of such is optimal for human health and longevity. He held many radical opinions on biology and nutrition. He argued that the body could not store protein or fat as adipose tissue, but would instead be simply excreted if consumed in excess, and that only consumption of carbohydrates and sugars could make someone obese. He also theorized that diabetes was not technically a disease but actually the term for the damage wrought by insulin, and that adopting a zero carb diet would treat this so-called disease.

Stanley died after a car accident in Australia on Saturday, March 12, 2011, not Sunday, March 13, as reported in most publications (a widely propagated error stemming from the Monday release to the press of the initial family statement, which was written on Sunday, stating he &quot;died yesterday&quot;). The statement released on behalf of Stanley&#x27;s family said the car crash occurred near his home, on a rural stretch of highway near Mareeba, Queensland.

His ashes were placed on the soundboard at the celebration of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 50th anniversary at the Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead shows in Chicago, on July 3–5, 2015.

==Owsley Stanley Foundation==

Shortly before his death, Stanley was in the process of curating and releasing the first of a planned series of concert recordings, to be called &quot;Bear&#x27;s Sonic Journals&quot;. The first of these releases was set to be &quot;Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968&quot; by Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin. After he died, the album was finished and released by Columbia / Legacy Records, under the supervision of his family and some close friends.

Subsequently, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization known as the Owsley Stanley Foundation was founded, dedicated to restoring and preserving the archive of Stanley&#x27;s recordings, which he called his &quot;sonic journals&quot;. Through the work of the Owsley Stanley Foundation, some of these concert recordings have been released as a series of live albums.

<text>The locus coeruleus () (LC), also spelled locus caeruleus or locus ceruleus, is a nucleus in the pons of the brainstem involved with physiological responses to stress and panic. It is a part of the reticular activating system in the reticular formation.

The locus coeruleus, which in Latin means &quot;blue spot&quot;, is the principal site for brain synthesis of norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The locus coeruleus and the areas of the body affected by the norepinephrine it produces are described collectively as the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system or LC-NA system. Norepinephrine may also be released directly into the blood from the adrenal medulla.

==Anatomy==

The locus coeruleus (LC) is located in the posterior area of the rostral pons in the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle. It is composed of mostly medium-size neurons. Melanin granules inside the neurons contribute to its blue colour. Thus, it is also known as the &quot;blue nucleus&quot;, or the &quot;nucleus pigmentosus pontis&quot; (heavily pigmented pontine nucleus). The neuromelanin is formed by the polymerization of norepinephrine and is analogous to the black dopamine-based neuromelanin in the substantia nigra.

In adult humans (19-78) the locus coeruleus has 22,000 to 51,000 total pigmented neurons that range in size between 31,000 and 60,000 μm3.

==Connections==
The projections of this nucleus reach far and wide. For example, they innervate the spinal cord, the brain stem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the thalamic relay nuclei, the amygdala, the basal telencephalon, and the cortex. The norepinephrine from the LC has an excitatory effect on most of the brain, mediating arousal and priming the brain&#x27;s neurons to be activated by stimuli.

As an important homeostatic control center of the body, the locus coeruleus receives afferents from the hypothalamus. The cingulate gyrus and the amygdala also innervate the LC, allowing emotional pain and stressors to trigger noradrenergic responses. The cerebellum and afferents from the raphe nuclei also project to the LC, in particular the pontine raphe nucleus and dorsal raphe nucleus.

===Inputs===
The locus coeruleus receives inputs from a number of other brain regions, primarily:
*The Medial prefrontal cortex, whose connection is constant, excitatory, and increases in strength with raised activity levels in the subject
*The Nucleus paragigantocellularis, which integrates autonomic and environmental stimuli
*The Nucleus prepositus, which is involved in gaze
*The Lateral hypothalamus, which releases orexin, which, as well as its other functions, is excitatory in the locus coeruleus.

===Outputs===
The projections from the locus coeruleus consist of neurons that utilize norepinephrine as their primary neurotransmitter. These projections include the following connections:
:* LC → Amygdala and Hippocampus
:* LC → Brain stem and Spinal cord
:* LC → Cerebellum
:* LC → Cerebral cortex
:* LC → Hypothalamus
:* LC → Tectum
:* LC → Thalamus
:* LC → Ventral tegmental area

==Function==
It is related to many functions via its widespread projections. The LC-NA system modulates cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, brainstem, and spinal cord circuits. Some of the most important functions influenced by this system are:
* Arousal and sleep-wake cycle
* Attention and memory
* Behavioral and cognitive flexibility, creativity, behavioral inhibition and stress (psychological)
* Cognitive control
* Decision making and utility maximization
* Emotions
* Neuroplasticity
* Posture and balance
* Global model failure where predictions about the world are strongly violated
The locus coeruleus is a part of the reticular activating system, and is almost completely inactivated in rapid eye movement sleep.

==Pathophysiology==
The locus coeruleus may figure in clinical depression, panic disorder, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and anxiety. Some medications including norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (reboxetine, atomoxetine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (bupropion) are believed to show efficacy by acting upon neurons in this area.

Research continues to reveal that norepinephrine (NE) is a critical regulator of numerous activities from stress response, the formation of memory to attention and arousal. Many neuropsychiatric disorders precipitate from alterations to NE modulated neurocircuitry: disorders of affect, anxiety disorders, PTSD, ADHD and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Alterations in the locus coeruleus (LC) accompany dysregulation of NE function and likely play a key role in the pathophysiology of these neuropsychiatric disorders.

===In stress===
The locus coeruleus is responsible for mediating many of the sympathetic effects during stress. The locus coeruleus is activated by stress, and will respond by increasing norepinephrine secretion, which in turn will alter cognitive function (through the prefrontal cortex), increase motivation (through nucleus accumbens), activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and increase the sympathetic discharge/inhibit parasympathetic tone (through the brainstem). Specific to the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, norepinephrine will stimulate the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus, that induces adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the anterior pituitary and subsequent cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands. Norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus will feedback to inhibit its production, and corticotropin-releasing factor will feedback to inhibit its production, while positively feeding to the locus coeruleus to increase norepinephrine production.

The LC&#x27;s role in cognitive function in relation to stress is complex and multi-modal. Norepinephrine released from the LC can act on α2 receptors to increase working memory, or an excess of NE may decrease working memory by binding to the lower-affinity α1 receptors.

Psychiatric research has documented that enhanced noradrenergic postsynaptic responsiveness in the neuronal pathway (brain circuit) that originates in the locus coeruleus and ends in the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala is a major factor in the pathophysiology of most stress-induced fear-circuitry disorders and especially in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The LC neurons are probably the origin of the first or second &quot;leg&quot; of the &quot;PTSD circuit.&quot; An important 2005 study of deceased American army veterans from World War II has shown combat-related PTSD to be associated with a postmortem-diminished number of neurons in the locus coeruleus on the right side of the brain.

===In opiate withdrawal===
Opioids inhibit the firing of neurons in the locus coeruleus. When opioid consumption is stopped, the increased activity of the locus coeruleus contributes to the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. The α2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine is used to counteract this withdrawal effect by decreasing adrenergic neurotransmission from the locus coeruleus.

===Rett syndrome ===
The genetic defect of the transcriptional regulator MECP2 is responsible for Rett syndrome. A MECP2 deficiency has been associated to catecholaminergic dysfunctions related to autonomic and sympathoadrenergic system in mouse models of Rett Syndrome (RTT). The locus coeruleus is the major source of noradrenergic innervation in the brain and sends widespread connections to rostral (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus) and caudal (cerebellum, brainstem nuclei) brain areas and. Indeed, an alteration of this structure could contribute to several symptoms observed in MECP2-deficient mice. Changes in the electrophysiological properties of cells in the locus ceruleus were shown. These Locus Coeruleus cell changes include hyperexcitability and decreased functioning of its noradrenergic innervation. A reduction of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA level, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, was detected in the whole pons of MECP2-null male as well as in adult heterozygous female mice. Using immunoquantification techniques, a decrease of TH protein staining level, number of locus coeruleus TH-expressing neurons and density of dendritic arborization surrounding the structure was shown in symptomatic MECP2-deficient mice. However, locus coeruleus cells are not dying but are more likely losing their fully mature phenotype, since no apoptotic neurons in the pons were detected. Researchers have concluded that, &quot;Because these neurons are a pivotal source of norepinephrine throughout the brainstem and forebrain and are involved in the regulation of diverse functions disrupted in Rett Syndrome, such as respiration and cognition, we hypothesize that the locus coeruleus is a critical site at which loss of MECP2 results in CNS dysfunction. Restoration of normal locus ceruleus function may therefore be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Rett Syndrome.&quot; This could explain why a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (desipramine, DMI), which enhances the extracellular NE levels at all noradrenergic synapses, ameliorated some Rett syndrome symptoms in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
The locus coeruleus is affected in many forms of neurodegenerative diseases: genetic and idiopathic Parkinson&#x27;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick&#x27;s disease, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It is also affected in Down syndrome. For example, there is up to 80% loss of locus coeruleus neurons in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Mouse models of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease show accelerated progression after chemical destruction of the locus coeruleus. Neurofibrillary tangles, a primary biomarker of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, may be found in the locus coeruleus decades before any clinical symptoms. The norepinephrine from locus coeruleus cells in addition to its neurotransmitter role locally diffuses from &quot;varicosities&quot;. As such it provides an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress Aβ-induced production of cytokines and promotes phagocytosis of Aβ. This suggests that degeneration of the locus coeruleus might be responsible for increased Aβ deposition in AD brains. Degeneration of pigmented neurons in this region in Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease can be visualized in vivo with Neuromelanin MRI. Since the marked degeneration of locus coeruleus, and the neuroprotective properties of noradrenaline, Ian Robertson proposed the &quot;Noradrenergic Theory of Cognitive Reserve&quot; which postulates that the upregulation of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system throughout the lifespan may enhance cognitive stimulation contributing to cognitive reserve preventing from neurodegeneration. Evidence appear to support this theory reporting the locus coeruleus integrity primarily responsible of biological brain maintenance, cognitive efficiency, and reduced neuropathological burden.

=== Sleep deprivation ===
Animal studies showed that sleep deprivation can reduce the number of neurons in the locus coeruleus. Therefore the possibility of lasting damages to human brain functions due to sleep deprivation has become a matter of discussion.

==History==
The locus coeruleus was discovered in 1784 by Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr, redescribed later by Johann Christian Reil in 1809 and named by the brothers Joseph and Karl Wenzel in 1812. High monoamine oxidase activity in the rodent LC was found in 1959, monoamines were found in 1964 and the widespread projections of noradrenergic neurons in the 1970s. An important advance in understanding the anatomical organization of the locus coeruleus was the application of the Falck-Hillarp technique, which combines freeze-dried tissue and formaldehyde to cause catecholamines (such as norepinephrine) and serotonin to fluoresce in tissue sections.

===Etymology===
====&quot;Coeruleus or caeruleus&quot;====
The &#x27;English&#x27; name &quot;locus coeruleus&quot; is actually a Latin expression consisting of the noun, &quot;locus&quot;, &quot;place&quot; or &quot;spot&quot; and the adjective &quot;coeruleus&quot;, &quot;dark blue&quot; or &quot;sky-blue&quot;. This was aptly translated into English as &quot;blue place&quot; in 1907 in the English translation of the official Latin anatomic nomenclature of 1895, &quot;Nomina Anatomica&quot;. The name of the &quot;locus coeruleus&quot; is derived from its azure appearance in unstained brain tissue. The color is due to light scattering from neuromelanin in noradrenergic (producing norepinephrine) nerve cell bodies.

The spelling &quot;coeruleus&quot; is actually considered incorrect, with dictionaries of classical Latin preferring &quot;caeruleus&quot; instead. &quot;Caeruleus&quot; is derived from &quot;caelum&quot;, hence the spelling with -ae, like caeluleus → caeruleus. &quot;Caelum&quot; in classical Latin could refer to &quot;the sky&quot;, &quot;the heaven&quot; or &quot;the vault of heaven&quot;. In mediaeval Latin, orthographic variants such as &quot;coelum&quot; for classical Latin &quot;caelum&quot; and &quot;cerulans&quot; for classical Latin &quot;caerulans&quot; can be found. In English, the color adjective &quot;cerulean&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;caeruleus&quot;. In addition, &quot;ceiling&quot; is ultimately derived from Latin &quot;caelum&quot;.

====&quot;Official Latin nomenclature&quot;====
The official Latin nomenclature, &quot;Nomina Anatomica&quot; as ratified in Basel in 1895 and in Jena in 1935 contained the orthographically correct form &quot;locus caeruleus&quot;. The &quot;Nomina Anatomica&quot; published in 1955 inadvertently introduced the incorrect spelling &quot;locus coeruleus&quot;, without further explanation. The subsequent edition monophthongized the diphthong, resulting in &quot;locus ceruleus&quot;, as they proclaimed that: &quot;All diphthongs should be eliminated&quot;. This form was retained in the subsequent edition. The following two editions from 1977
and 1983 reverted the orthography back to the incorrect spelling &quot;locus coeruleus&quot;, while the subsequent edition from 1989 eventually returned to the correct spelling &quot;locus caeruleus&quot;. The current edition of the &quot;Nomina Anatomica&quot;, rebaptized as &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, dictates &quot;locus caeruleus&quot; in its list of Latin expressions and correspondingly mentions &quot;locus caeruleus&quot; in its list of English equivalents. This is in line with the statement made by the chairman of the &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot; that &quot;the committee decided that Latin terms when used in English should be in correct Latin&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
On &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, season 5, episode 16 (&quot;The Vacation Solution&quot;), Amy tasks Sheldon with removing the locus coeruleus from a tissue sample.

In Season 3, Episode 14 of Fear The Walking Dead, a man offers preserved Locus Coeruleus as drugs.

<text>Nogometni klub Maribor () is a Slovenian professional football club based in Maribor, Slovenia. It competes in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the top tier of the Slovenian football league system. Nicknamed &quot;The Purples&quot; (&quot;&quot;), the club was founded on 12 December 1960. They are regarded as a symbol of Slovenian football, particularly in their home region of Styria in northeastern Slovenia.

Maribor have won a record 16 Slovenian PrvaLiga titles, 9 Slovenian Cups and 4 Slovenian Supercups. The club won seven consecutive league titles between 1997 and 2003, and five consecutive titles between 2011 and 2015. Prior to Slovenia&#x27;s independence in 1991, Maribor played in the Yugoslav football system. They won the Yugoslav second division in 1967 and were therefore promoted to the top-level Yugoslav First League, where they stayed until 1972. They are one of three Slovenian teams that participated in the Yugoslavia&#x27;s highest division between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991.

Maribor is the only Slovenian club that reached the group stages of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. In addition, the club is one of the two founding members of the Slovenian PrvaLiga (along with Celje) which have never been relegated from the league since the inaugural 1991–92 season.

The club have a long-standing rivalry with Olimpija from the capital Ljubljana, with whom they contest the Eternal derby. Other rivalries include those with Celje, dubbed as the Styrian derby, and the Prekmurje–Styria derby, contested between Maribor and Mura. Maribor&#x27;s home ground is the Ljudski vrt stadium, which has a capacity of 11,709 seats. The traditional colours of the club are purple, yellow and white.

==History==

===Founding and early years (1960–1967)===
Nogometni klub Maribor was founded on 12 December 1960 by officials and players of NK Branik Maribor, a club that folded a few months earlier. Srečko Koren was appointed the first president of the club, and Andrija Pflander the first head coach. The club played their first friendly match on 5 February 1961 against Kovinar, defeating them 2–1 with two goals by Stefan Tolič. In their first season, Maribor won the Slovenian Republic League (third tier in Yugoslavia) and qualified for the 1961–62 Yugoslav Second League through the play-offs. In 1961, the club also moved to a newly built Ljudski vrt stadium. After six seasons in the second division, Maribor won the league and was promoted to the top flight Yugoslav First League in the 1966–67 season.
===Yugoslav top division (1967–1972)===

Maribor played their first match in the Yugoslav top tier against Vardar in Skopje; Maras scored the only goal for Maribor in a 1–1 draw. Their first win came in August 1967, when Maribor defeated Proleter Zrenjanin 3–0 at home. During the season, the first ever match in the Yugoslav top flight involving two clubs from Slovenia was held, when Maribor hosted a goalless match against their rivals Olimpija from Ljubljana in front of 13,000 spectators. Each match between the two sides during this period attracted large crowds, with attendance sometimes as high as 20,000. Maribor finished their inaugural top division season in 12th place out of 16 teams.
In the 1969–70 season, Maribor finished 10th out of 18 clubs, their highest ever ranking in Yugoslav football. Their last season in the top division was 1971–72, when the team finished dead last with just 20 points in 34 matches. Mladen Kranjc was Maribor&#x27;s top scorer in each of the five Yugoslav top division seasons, scoring a total of 54 league goals, which eventually led to his transfer to one of the top Yugoslav clubs, Dinamo Zagreb. During their five-year stay in Yugoslav&#x27;s top division, the club played a total of 166 league matches and achieved 40 wins, 57 draws and 69 defeats.

===Dark years and bribery scandal (1972–1991)===

In the 1972–73 season, Maribor were competing in the second tier. They finished the season in second place, only behind Zagreb, which meant that they qualified for the Yugoslav first division promotion play-offs. In the first qualifying round against Montenegrin side Budućnost, Maribor won on penalties and qualified for the decisive round against Proleter. The first leg was played at home on 8 July 1973, and is acknowledged as one of the most memorable matches in the history of Maribor, as it still holds the club&#x27;s home attendance record. There were 20,000 spectators, 15,000 of whom were already present in the stands almost three hours before the start, eventually helping Maribor to win the game 3–1. However, the two-goal advantage proved to be insufficient as Proleter won the second leg 3–0 and was promoted. When the score was 1–0 for Proleter, Josip Ražić equalised in the 23rd minute, but the goal was not awarded by the referee. Later, the television replay showed that the ball had actually crossed the goal line and that the goal should have stood.

The period between 1973 and 1991 is one of the darkest in the club&#x27;s history. In the following 1973–74 season, the club failed to stay near the top of the second division and finished the season in 13th place. In the 1974–75 season, Maribor were relegated to the third-tier Slovenian Republic League for the first time in 14 years, but the club immediately returned to the second division by being 15 points clear at the top of the Republic League table at the end of the 1975–76 season. The club nearly returned to the top tier in 1978–79 when they finished as runners-up of the second division, six points behind Bosnian side Čelik Zenica, but failed to win the promotion play-offs.

At the end of the 1980–81 season, after Maribor managed to avoid relegation from the second Yugoslav division, a bribery scandal emerged and caused the club to be relegated by the decision of the Football Association of Yugoslavia disciplinary committee. The club allegedly had a secret fund that served to bribe officials and opponents. The fund was abolished in 1968 after the club&#x27;s promotion to the first division, but was later established again in 1976. After the scandal and the subsequent relegation, Maribor spent the following years bouncing between the second and third Yugoslav divisions until Slovenia&#x27;s independence in 1991.

===Domestic domination after independence (1991–2004)===
Following Slovenia&#x27;s independence in June 1991, Maribor were one of the founding members of the newly formed Slovenian First League for the inaugural 1991–92 season. In the first few seasons, Maribor&#x27;s rivals Olimpija from Ljubljana dominated the league. Nevertheless, Maribor managed to win the first edition of the Slovenian Cup in 1992 after beating Olimpija 4–3 on penalties in the final. In the next season, Maribor made their debut in international UEFA competitions, appearing in UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. They played their first international match on 19 August 1992, when they hosted Ħamrun Spartans of Malta and won 4–0. Ante Šimundža scored the first European goal for the club. Maribor were Slovenian League runners-up in 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1994–95, before finishing fourth in the 1995–96 season. During this period Maribor won another cup title in 1993–94, defeating Mura 3–2 on aggregate over two legs in the final.

The 1996–97 season proved to be a turning point in the history of Maribor. The club won the league and became champions for the first time in their history. During the season, the average home attendance was 5,289 spectators, which is still a record .&lt;ref name=&quot;1996/1997&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The final match of the season was played on 1 June 1997 against Beltinci in front of 14,000 spectators, which is also a joint-record of the Slovenian top division. In that season Maribor also won the 1996–97 Slovenian Cup, thus winning the domestic double, a feat they repeated in the 1998–99 season. After their first title in 1996–97, Maribor went on to win six more titles, bringing their total number to seven consecutive titles by 2003. In the 1999–2000 season, the club, led by head coach Bojan Prašnikar, defeated Genk and Lyon in the qualifying rounds of the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League and thus qualified for the group stage of the competition for the first time. Maribor were drawn into the group with Dynamo Kyiv, Bayer Leverkusen, and Lazio. They finished in last place with four points out of six games.

===Financial difficulties (2004–2008)===
The 2003–04 Slovenian Cup was the last trophy won by Maribor before the club declined for several years. Between 2004 and 2007, the club was plagued by major financial difficulties, and even came close to being disbanded at one point. Due to their large debts, which at one point amounted to over €3 million, the club could not afford to buy new players. As a result, the first team at the time consisted mostly of youth players mixed with a couple of foreign players brought to the club on free transfers. In the autumn of 2006, the leadership of the club changed, and it was not until January 2011 that the club announced that the debt had been paid in full. During this period, Maribor never finished higher than third in the league, and were runners-up of the Slovenian Cup twice, in 2007 and 2008. They were, however, one of the eleven winners of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, in which they defeated Spanish side Villarreal 3–2 on aggregate in the final round, only a couple of months after Villareal had played in the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League.

===Zlatko Zahovič&#x27;s golden era (2008–2020)===

In July 2007, Maribor appointed former Slovenian international Zlatko Zahovič as the club&#x27;s sporting director, which marked the beginning of the golden era of the club.

In May 2008, Maribor played their first match at the renovated stadium in front of over 12,000 spectators. In the same month, Darko Milanič, who later became the most successful manager in the club&#x27;s history, was appointed as manager. Under his leadership, Maribor won the league in the 2008–09 season, their first title in six years. The following season, they failed to retain the league title, finishing second behind Koper. However, they won the cup title after beating Domžale 3–2 in the final, as well as their first ever Slovenian Supercup title after beating Interblock.

At the end of 2010, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary, and also secured its ninth Slovenian league title during the course of the season. In the following years, Maribor won four more consecutive titles, bringing the total championship tally to 13, before finally losing the title in 2016 to their biggest rivals Olimpija Ljubljana. In 2012, Maribor also obtained a record number of points (85). Furthermore, Maribor also won two back-to-back doubles in this period, beating Celje on both occasions in the 2012 and 2013 Slovenian cup finals.

In 2011, Maribor made a breakthrough in international competitions. They eliminated Rangers in the UEFA Europa League play-offs and qualified for the group stage, their first group stage appearance in European competitions in more than a decade. They obtained one point in six matches, holding Braga to a 1–1 draw at home. In the next season, they again qualified for the group stage, and managed to win four points after defeating Panathinaikos and drawing with Tottenham Hotspur, both at home.

In their third consecutive appearance in the group stage, in 2013–14, Maribor advanced to the knockout phase of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League for the first time. In the round of 32, they were eliminated by the eventual winners of the competition, Sevilla, 4–3 on aggregate. Their successful European run was upgraded in the 2014–15 season, when Maribor finally qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the second time in their history, after eliminating Celtic in the play-offs. They were drawn into Group G with Chelsea, Schalke 04, and Sporting CP. After a draw and a defeat against each team, Maribor won three points in six matches.

In 2015–16, Maribor failed to win the league title for the first time in six years, but reclaimed the throne the following season, winning their 14th national title. As Slovenian champions, Maribor represented Slovenia in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, and for the third time in the club&#x27;s history reached the group stage. Maribor competed in Group E, along with Spartak Moscow, Sevilla, and Liverpool. The club again obtained three points in six matches, the same as in 2014, after drawing with Sevilla at home and twice against Spartak. Their 7–0 defeat to Liverpool was the club&#x27;s heaviest home defeat in European competitions, and their second highest European defeat overall. In the same season, Maribor failed to win a trophy for the first time since 2007–08, losing the league title to Olimpija on head-to-head record after finishing with the same number of points. Olimpija also eliminated Maribor in the quarter-finals of the national cup, and therefore Maribor failed to reach the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2002–03.

In 2018–19, Maribor won its 15th national title under the guidance of Milanič, who won his sixth league title with the club and became the most successful manager in the Slovenian top division. However, Milanič and Zahovič left the club in March 2020 after a series of poor results. During Zahovič&#x27;s era, Maribor won eight league titles and reached the UEFA Champions League group stages twice.

==Club identity==
===Colours, kits and nicknames===
Throughout the entire history of NK Maribor, the main colour of the club has been purple. For this reason, the team is nicknamed &quot;The Purples&quot; (&#x27;) and &quot;The Violets&quot; (&#x27;). The club is also referred to as the &quot;Viole&quot;, predominantly in the region of the former Yugoslavia.

When NK Maribor was established, some of the club officials were in favour of red and white colours, inspired by the coat of arms of the city of Maribor. However, because many football teams in Yugoslavia already wore red and white jerseys, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to follow the example of Fiorentina and their purple and white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain of the club, was the one who suggested the combination after seeing the Italian team in &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. Since it was almost impossible to get purple kits in Yugoslavia in 1961, the players painted them themselves. The club&#x27;s secondary colours are yellow and white.

In March 1973, the name of the sponsor first appeared on Maribor kits. Since Slovenia&#x27;s independence in 1991, the main kit sponsors have been Pivovarna Laško, OTP banka (Nova KBM prior 2024) and Zavarovalnica Sava (Zavarovalnica Maribor prior 2016).

===Crest===
The current crest of the club is based on the official coat of arms of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in a shape of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished at the end of the 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the club&#x27;s current badge does not represent a white dove facing down towards the castle, but a minimalist portrayal of a person. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included white, one of the club&#x27;s traditional colours, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012, the crest includes a yellow star at the top, indicating the first ten domestic titles won.

===Anthem===
Since 1992, the club&#x27;s official anthem has been the song &quot;Heja, hej Viole&quot;, which was written and composed by the band Čudežna polja. 80 members of the Viole Maribor fan group also participated in the recording as backing vocalists. The premiere performance of the song took place on 16 September 1992, at the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup match between Maribor and Atlético Madrid.

==Stadium==

Maribor have played their home games at Ljudski vrt since June 1961. Previously, the club played a very short period of its early history at Stadion ob Tržaški cesti. Prior World War II, the ground consisted of just a pitch with a small stand, which was destroyed during the war. The site has been used for football since at least the early 20th century; between 1910 and 1960, it was the home ground of many teams based in Maribor, including Marburger Sportvereinigung, SV Rapid Marburg, SK Hertha, SK Rote Elf, I. SSK Maribor and NK Branik Maribor.

After the war, the ground was renovated and opened in 1952, but the main grandstand was not built until the early 1960s. On 25 June 1961, Maribor played its first match at the stadium, against Mladost Zabok, when the grandstand was still under construction.

Ljudski vrt is the only stadium in Maribor that is located on the left bank of the river Drava. It is considered a natural, cultural, architectural and sports landmark of the city and is named after a public park previously located in the area. A prominent feature of the grandstand is the 129.8 metres long and 18.4 m high concrete arch. In 1994, floodlights were installed and the stadium hosted its first match at night. Since then, the stadium went through several renovations. The most notable was the one between 2006 and 2008, when three of the four stands (South, East and North) were demolished and completely rebuilt. The West Stand was completely renovated in 2021, bringing the stadium&#x27;s current capacity to 11,709 seats.

In addition to being the home ground of Maribor, the stadium also occasionally hosts matches of the Slovenia national football team.

==Supporters and rivalries==
===Supporters===

NK Maribor is known for having a loyal and passionate supporters. In addition to the city of Maribor and its surroundings, the club also has a large fan base in Styria and Carinthia, with smaller groups of supporters also present in other parts of Slovenia. After its founding, Maribor was marked as a citizens&#x27; club, and their city rivals Železničar Maribor as a working class club.

The club has an ultras group called Viole Maribor, established in 1989. An apolitical group, they are located on the South Stand of the stadium. The record for the most travelling fans in domestic competitions was in 2001, when 3,000 Maribor supporters gathered in Ljubljana, while the most fans gathered abroad was in 2017 during the club&#x27;s UEFA Champions League campaign, when over 2,400 supporters travelled to Liverpool.

Since the establishment of the Slovenian First League in 1991, Maribor has had the highest average home attendance in 27 out of 33 seasons. The highest average league attendance was in the 1996–97 season, when on average 5,289 people attended Maribor&#x27;s home matches, which is a record in Slovenian club football. In addition, Maribor is the first team to gather more than two million people at Slovenian First League matches.

===Rivalries===
Maribor&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with Olimpija from the capital Ljubljana, against whom they contest the Eternal derby (&quot;). The rivalry dates back to the early 1960s, when both clubs used to play in the Yugoslav Second League. The first official match between the two clubs was played on 2 September 1962 at the Bežigrad Stadium in Ljubljana, and was watched by around 10,000 spectators.

In 2005, the old Olimpija was dissolved due to financial difficulties. In the same year, a phoenix club was established under the name NK Bežigrad, and was later renamed as NK Olimpija Ljubljana. The first derby between Maribor and the newly formed club was played on 24 October 2007 in the quarter-finals of the Slovenian Cup. When Olimpija was promoted to the Slovenian First League in 2009, the rivalry came back to life.

Maribor also developed a rivalry with another Styrian club, Celje, dubbed the Styrian derby (&quot;). Maribor and Celje contested in three Slovenian Cup finals, all of which were won by Maribor, and also competed for the national title in the 2002–03 season, when Maribor defeated Celje 2–1 in the decisive match with two late-game goals, clinching their seventh consecutive title.

Another rival of Maribor is Mura from Prekmurje, with whom they contest the Prekmurje–Styria derby (&quot;&quot;). In the 2020–21 season, Maribor and Mura contested the title-deciding match on the final day of the season. A draw was enough for Maribor, but Mura won 3–1 and clinched their first-ever title.

He played his last game for the club on 7 July 2005, a friendly match against his former club Hajduk Split, where he was substituted after 19 minutes of play in a symbolic gesture. In May 2021, the club retired another squad number, 33, in honour of goalkeeper Jasmin Handanović, who made over 350 appearances for Maribor between 2011 and 2021.

===Youth Academy===
The academy is responsible for the development of young players in the club. It is composed of ten youth selections, ranging from under-8 to under-19, with over 210 youth players in the system. The club has also spread the activities of the football school to primary schools in the city of Maribor, where around 850 of the youngest footballers train as part of the Children&#x27;s Football School (&quot;&quot;).

Since the establishment of Maribor&#x27;s youth system in its present form in 1990, the academy has been one of the most successful in the country in terms of titles won. The under-19 team holds the national record for most titles, having won the under-19 league eight times. The same team has also won five Youth Cups. Other teams are equally successful as both the under-17 and under-15 teams holds the record for the most titles in their category. In addition, Maribor&#x27;s youth selections were the first in the country to win championship titles in the four highest youth classes (under-13, under-15, under-17 and under-19) during the same season. In 2012, a record eight Maribor players were called to the Slovenian under-17 national team for the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship.

<text>St. Joseph College Seminary was a college of Loyola University Chicago and the college seminary of the Archdiocese of Chicago. It later became a residence hall for Loyola.

== History ==
Saint Joseph College Seminary opened as Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Niles, Illinois in 1964 and became known as the Niles College Seminary.

In 1994, the Niles campus was sold and the seminary moved to Loyola University where the seminary was renamed St. Joseph College Seminary in honor of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin.

In the Archdiocesan Chicago Seminary system, Saint Joseph College Seminary trained college-aged men for the Catholic priesthood. The Archdiocese of Chicago Seminary System also included the Archbishop Quigley Scholars Program, an outreach program for high school students, and the University of Saint Mary of the Lake incorporating the Cardinal Mundelein Seminary, a major seminary for graduate-level theology studies.

In January 2019, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of the Archdiocese announced that the seminary would close in June 2019. The seminary building was sold to Loyola University Chicago and now serves as one of the university&#x27;s residence halls.

<text>Hermann Kant (; 14 June 1926 – 14 August 2016) was a German writer noted for his writings during the time of East Germany. He won the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1967. He served the Stasi as an informer under the codename &quot;IM Martin&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hermann Kant was born on 14 June 1926 in Hamburg, Germany the son of a factory worker and a gardener born into poverty. His younger brother, Uwe Kant, became a well-known children&#x27;s author. Because of the impending bombing of Hamburg during the Second World War, the family moved to Parchim in 1940, where his paternal grandfather lived as a master potter. After passing elementary school he began an electrician apprenticeship in Parchim, which he completed in 1944. On 8 December 1944 he was drafted into the German Military. He became a Polish POW, was held in Warsaw&#x27;s Mokotów Prison and later was transferred to a labor camp, which was located on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto. He was the co-founder of the antifascist committee and teacher at the Anti-fascist Central School. During this time he met the writer Anna Seghers, who would have a lasting impression on him. After being released as a prisoner of war in 1949, he moved to East Germany and joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Kant finished High School in 1952 at the &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants Faculty&quot; in Greifswald. From 1952 to 1956 he studied German literature at the Humboldt University of Berlin. His thesis was entitled &quot;The representation of the ideological-political structure of the German fascist army in Pliviers novel Stalingrad.&quot; After graduating he worked until 1957 as a research assistant at the university and was also the editor of the student magazine, &quot;Tua res&quot;, from 1957 to 1959. In 1960, Kant became a freelance writer and member of the Writers&#x27; Union of East Germany.

== Writing career ==
Kant&#x27;s first book was published in 1962 as a collection of short stories entitled, &quot;A Little South Seas&quot;. The book showed stylistic influences adopted from the American Short Story genre and authors such as O. Henry, giving the East German literature a new satirical and a plainly ironic style.

In his first novel, &quot;The Aula&quot; (1965), Kant described his own experiences at the &quot;Workers and Peasants Faculty.&quot; In the book, the closure of the faculty is an occasion for a graduation, for which the main character is to deliver a speech, which determines the fate of their fellow students and thus a part of their own lives in the early days of East Germany. &quot;Kant&#x27;s most famous and best novel&quot; made him famous overnight in both the East and the West, while the book also being considered controversial in both German states. In East Germany most viewed the book as a &quot;partisan commitment&quot; of Kantian protagonists devoted to the &quot;socialist movement&quot;, Marcel Reich-Ranicki remarked that Kant was too timid to write about the real conditions that existed in East Germany.

In 1972, the novel was published in a second edition, where he perfected his writing style. The publication was always seen as a false depiction of parts of the East German cultural bureaucracy, and Kant was criticized for painting a misrepresentation of the social conflict. In 1976 he began developing the novel &quot;Der Aufenthalt&quot; in the Bildungsroman style. He tells the story of Mark Niebuhr, mistakenly labelled as a German war criminal. With the protagonist socialist Roman left Kant&#x27;s &quot;hero&quot; with nothing to do. The story describes a &quot;conversion&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot;, but also knowledge of &quot;disenchantment&quot;. The writing was depicted in the 1983 DEFA film &quot;The Turning Point&quot;.

In addition, Kant wrote occasionally scripts and screenplays, including for Günter Reisch&#x27;s feature film &quot;Ach du fröhliche...&quot; (1962 - with supporting role) and, based on his own novel, turned into a made-for-TV movie; &quot;Mitten im kalten Winter&quot; (1968).

From the 1970s, Kant took despite its rather narrow view a &quot;weighty significance&quot; in the contemporary literature of East Germany, and had &quot;helped shape minds.&quot; Heiner Müller described Kant&#x27;s narrative &quot;Bronze Age&quot; (1986) in his autobiography as &quot;the sharpest East German satire&quot; which he had read in recent years. For many other colleagues, literary and social critic Kant was opposed to the &quot;pattern and quintessential as maneuverable as windy compromise literati&quot; become the bridge between conformism and confrontation; an impression that was reinforced by his vacillation as a literary functionary. So Kant remained in East and West &quot;one of the most controversial figures in East German literature&quot;.

<text>FK Sileks () is a football club based in Kratovo, North Macedonia, who play in the [[Macedonian First Football League|Macedonian First League.]]

==History==
FK Sileks Kratovo, a football club from Kratovo, Macedonia, has a rich history that dates back several decades, with significant achievements, memorable moments, and prominent figures shaping its legacy. Here&#x27;s an overview of the club&#x27;s history:

Early Years

FK Sileks was founded in 1965, during the Yugoslav period, and initially competed in the regional leagues. The club was named after the nearby Sileks lead and zinc mine, which played a significant role in the local economy and provided financial backing for the team. Despite being a small club, Sileks gradually built a reputation for itself within the regional competitions.

Rise to promience

The club&#x27;s first major breakthrough came in the early 1990s, after North Macedonia declared its independence from Yugoslavia. In 1992, the Macedonian First Football League was established, and FK Sileks became one of the founding members. Under the guidance of Ljubislav Ivanov &quot;Singo,&quot; a key figure in the club&#x27;s history, Sileks quickly rose to prominence.

During the 1990s, FK Sileks established itself as one of the strongest teams in the Macedonian league. The club won its first Macedonian First League title in the 1995-96 season and successfully defended the title in the following two seasons, achieving a historic &quot;three-peat&quot; by winning the league in 1996-97 and 1997-98. This period of dominance cemented FK Sileks as one of the top teams in the country.

Domestic Success 

FK Sileks&#x27; success wasn&#x27;t limited to the league. The club also enjoyed considerable success in the Macedonian Football Cup, winning the competition three times—in 1994, 1997, and 2021. The 1994 Cup victory was particularly notable, as it was the first time the club won a major domestic trophy. 

In addition to its three league titles and three cup victories, FK Sileks also won the Macedonian Super Cup in 1997, further solidifying its status as one of the country&#x27;s top football clubs during the 1990s and early 2000s.

European Competitions

FK Sileks&#x27; domestic success also gave the club the opportunity to participate in European competitions. Over the years, Sileks has competed in the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the UEFA Europa Conference League. While the club has yet to achieve significant success in Europe, its participation in these competitions has brought international exposure to the team and the town of Kratovo.

Challenges and Rebuilding

After a period of sustained success in the 1990s, FK Sileks faced several challenges in the early 2000s. Financial difficulties, changes in management, and the rise of other football clubs in North Macedonia led to a decline in the club&#x27;s fortunes. Sileks was relegated from the Macedonian First League in the early 2000s and spent several seasons in the second tier.

However, the club&#x27;s resilience and strong local support enabled it to rebuild. Sileks returned to the Macedonian First League and began to re-establish itself as a competitive team. In recent years, the club has once again become a regular participant in the top flight of Macedonian football.

Recent Achievements

In 2020-2021, FK Sileks enjoyed a resurgence, winning the Macedonian Football Cup for the first time in nearly two decades. This victory was a testament to the club&#x27;s enduring spirit and ability to overcome adversity.

Home Stadium

FK Sileks plays its home matches at the Gradski Stadion Kratovo, a small but passionate venue with a capacity of 1,800 spectators. The stadium has witnessed many of the club&#x27;s historic moments and continues to be a fortress for the team.

Notable Figures

- Ljubislav Ivanov &quot;Singo&quot; A key figure in the club&#x27;s history, Singo&#x27;s leadership during the 1990s was instrumental in FK Sileks&#x27; rise to prominence.

- Nedzmedin Memedi The club&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer, Memedi&#x27;s contributions on the pitch have made him a legend at FK Sileks.

<text>Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (; ; 23 January 1751 (OS 12 January 1750) – 4 June 1792 [O.S. 24 May 1792]) was a Baltic German writer of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement.

==Life==
Lenz was born in Sesswegen (Cesvaine), Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire, now Latvia, the son of the pietistic minister Christian David Lenz (1720–1798), later General Superintendent of Livonia. When Lenz was nine, in 1760, the family moved to Dorpat, now Tartu, where his father had been offered a minister&#x27;s post. His first published poem appeared when he was 15. From 1768 to 1770 he studied theology on a scholarship, first at Dorpat and then at Königsberg. While there, he attended lectures by Immanuel Kant, who encouraged him to read Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He began increasingly to follow his literary interests and to neglect theology. His first independent publication, the long poem &quot;Die Landplagen&quot; (&quot;Torments of the Land&quot;) appeared in 1769. He also studied music, most likely with either the Ukrainian virtuoso lutanist Timofey Belogradsky, then resident in Königsberg, or his student Johann Friedrich Reichardt.

In 1771 Lenz abandoned his studies in Königsberg. Much against the will of his father, who on that account broke off contact with him, he took a position little better than that of a servant with the brothers Friedrich Georg von Kleist and Ernst Nikolaus von Kleist, barons from Courland who were about to begin their military service as officer cadets, whom he accompanied to Strasbourg. Once there, he came into contact with the actuary Johann Daniel Salzmann, around whom had formed the literary group of the Société de philosophie et de belles lettres. The young Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who happened to be in Strasbourg, also frequented this group. Lenz became an acquaintance of Geothe and of Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling. Goethe now became Lenz&#x27;s literary idol, and through Goethe Lenz made contact with Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Kaspar Lavater, with whom he corresponded.

The following year, 1772, Lenz accompanied the Kleist brothers to the garrisons of Landau, Fort Louis and Wissembourg. He also fell in love with Friederike Brion, once the beloved of Goethe, but his feelings were not reciprocated.

In 1773 Lenz returned to Strasbourg and resumed his studies. The following year he gave up his position with the Kleist brothers and lived as a freelance writer, earning his living by private tutoring. His relations with Goethe became friendlier. While the two of them were visiting Emmendingen, Goethe introduced Lenz to his sister Cornelia and her husband Johann Georg Schlosser.

In April 1776 Lenz followed Goethe to the court of Weimar, where he was at first amicably received. But in early December, on Goethe&#x27;s instigation, he was expelled. The exact circumstances are unknown. Goethe broke off all personal contact with him after this and once referred in his diary to &quot;Lenz&#x27;s asininity&quot; (&quot;Lenzens Eseley&quot;).

Lenz then returned to Emmendingen, where the Schlossers took him in. From there he made a number of journeys to Alsace and Switzerland, including one to visit Lavater in Zürich in May 1777. The news of Cornelia Schlosser&#x27;s death, which reached him there in June of that year, had a powerful effect on him. He returned to Emmendingen, and then visited Lavater again. In November, while staying in Winterthur with Christoph Kaufmann, he may have suffered an attack of paranoid schizophrenia. In January 1778 Kaufmann sent Lenz to the philanthropist, social reformer and clergyman Johann Friedrich Oberlin in Waldersbach in Alsace, where he stayed from 20 January to 8 February. Despite the care of Oberlin and his wife, Lenz&#x27;s mental condition grew worse. He returned to Schlosser at Emmendingen, where he was lodged with a shoemaker and then with a forester.

His younger brother Karl fetched him in June 1779 from Hertingen, where he was under treatment by a doctor, and brought him to Riga, where their father had risen to the position of General Superintendent.

Lenz was unable to establish himself professionally in Riga. An attempt to make him director of the cathedral school came to nothing, as Herder refused to give him a reference. Nor did he have any greater success in St. Petersburg, where he lived from February to September 1780. He then took a position as a private tutor on an estate near Dorpat, returned to St. Petersburg for a time, and then went to Moscow in September 1781, where initially he stayed with the historian Friedrich Müller and learned Russian.

He worked as a private tutor, mixed in the circles of Russian Freemasons and authors, and helped produce a number of reformist schemes. He also translated books on Russian history into German. His mental condition however was steadily deteriorating, and at last he became entirely dependent on the goodwill and financial support of his Russian patrons.

In the early morning of 4 June 1792 (24 May in the Julian calendar) Lenz was found dead in a Moscow street. The place of his burial is unknown.

==Lenz as a literary figure==
&quot;Lenz&quot;, a novella fragment by Georg Büchner, deals with Lenz&#x27;s visit to the minister Friedrich Oberlin, in the Vosges. Lenz had visited Oberlin, on the suggestion of Kaufmann, because of his reputation as a pastor and psychologist. Oberlin&#x27;s account of the events of Lenz&#x27;s visit furnished Büchner with the source of his story, which in its turn was the source of Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s chamber opera &quot;Jakob Lenz&quot;.

In his 1923 play &quot;Weh um Michael&quot;, Waldfried Burggraf presented the life of Lenz, explaining his suicide as an act of despair at not finding an audience for his critique of society. One literary critic summarizes Burggraf&#x27;s treatment: &quot;His Michael Lenz is a voice in the wilderness crying out against moral and social injustice.&quot; 

In Paul Celan&#x27;s acceptance speech for the Georg Büchner Prize for Literature in 1960, both the historical man and the &quot;Lenz&quot; of Büchner&#x27;s fragment figure heavily. In the first line of Büchner&#x27;s novella, Lenz sets off for the mountains on 20 January. Celan relates this to the life of the poem, asking, &quot;Perhaps one can say that every poem has its 20th of January?&quot; He adds that the poem remains mindful of such dates. Celan also says of his work &quot;Conversation in the Mountains,&quot; composed after a missed encounter with Adorno, that it was written from such a date: that he started writing from his own &quot;20th of January.&quot;

More recently the writers Peter Schneider, in his story &quot;Lenz&quot; (1973), and Gert Hoffmann, in his novella &quot;Die Rückkehr des verlorenen J.M.R. Lenz nach Riga&quot; (&quot;The Return of the Lost J.M.R. Lenz to Riga&quot;, 1984), have given literary form to the events of his life.

Marc Buhl&#x27;s novel of 2002, &quot;Der rote Domino&quot; (&quot;The Red Domino&quot;), uses the friendship between Goethe and Lenz, and its abrupt end, as the inspiration for a detective story.

<doc id="833811" wikidata="Q11927084" url="?curid=833811" title="Jack Mormon">
<text>The term Jack Mormon is a slang term originating in nineteenth-century America. It was originally used to describe a person who was not a baptized member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints but who was friendly to church members and Mormonism, sympathized with them, and/or took an active interest in their belief system. Sometime in the early- to mid-twentieth century, however, the term began to refer to an individual deemed by adherents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to be an inactive or lapsed member of the LDS Church who, despite their personal religious viewpoint, maintained good relations with and positive feelings toward the church.

==Origin of the term==
On April 18, 1845, the term &quot;Jack Mormon&quot; appeared in &quot;The Ottawa Free Trader&quot; to refer to J. B. Backenstos, the sheriff of Hancock County, who was &quot;friendly to the Mormons, though not one himself.&quot; This early published use of the term marks perhaps the earliest appearance of &quot;Jack Mormon&quot; in print, though it was followed soon by other instances in papers such as the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Richmond Palladium&quot;. Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the &quot;Warsaw Signal&quot;, also coined the term &quot;Jack-Mason&quot; to refer to those who were sympathetic toward Freemasons in the Anti-Masonic political movement. These sympathetic non-Mormons included Nauvoo Justice of the Peace Daniel H. Wells, who later joined the church, and soldier and diplomat Thomas L. Kane. Kane was identified as a sympathetic Jack Mormon by US Army officials and the media, some of whom asserted that he had been secretly baptised into the LDS faith. However friendly toward the LDS people, Kane remained a Presbyterian all of his life.

Several LDS historians believe that the term was used prior to Sharp&#x27;s mention, and has ties to sympathetic Democrats in Jackson County, Missouri. Their belief is that the term originated in Missouri, during the Kirtland period of Latter Day Saint history, circa 1834. When Church members were expelled from Jackson County by a mob, many fled to Clay County, where local citizens, mostly Democrats, were sympathetic and friendly toward the Mormons. These citizens were pejoratively labeled &quot;Jack&quot; Mormons by the antagonistic citizens of Jackson County.

During the early 1980s, it was also used as a description of members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church) who broke from the church, in part, over belief in plural marriage.

==Political usage==
LDS Church membership was made up predominantly of Democrats until the early 1900s, possibly due to anti-Mormon positions held by the Republican party during the latter half of the 19th century. However, the church&#x27;s conservative positions on social issues such as sexuality, drug use, traditional family values, and the role of religion in government caused large numbers of previously Democratic Latter-day Saints to shift to the Republican Party by the late 1970s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the LDS church took a stand against the Equal Rights Amendment, and again increased the population&#x27;s participation in the Republican party. At that time, many members who were registered Democrats were called &quot;Jack Mormons&quot;, not as a negative term, but to distinguish them as traditional liberal Democrats. Because of the negative connotation of the term&#x27;s modern context, this usage was short-lived. An alternative theory and contemporary usage holds that the term refers to a person who is a Mormon in &quot;name only&quot; (as in having a common Mormon surname) as though the &quot;Mormon&quot; label were nothing but a surname to this individual.

The term was made popular by heavyweight champion William Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Dempsey, born in Manassa, Colorado, on June 24, 1895. During the 1920s, the greatest American sports hero of the day was undoubtedly Babe Ruth; his closest rival was Dempsey, a tough heavyweight boxer from the mining West. Around 1880, an LDS Church missionary converted Dempsey&#x27;s parents and they moved to the Mormon village of Manassa, Colorado. While his father parted ways with the church, his mother remained a devoted member. Dempsey would write, &quot;I&#x27;m proud to be a Mormon. And ashamed to be the Jack Mormon that I am.&quot;

==Change in terminology==
The term is now used to describe a baptized member of the LDS Church who rarely or never practices the religion, but is still friendly toward the church. Alternatively, it can be used for someone that is of Mormon descent but unbaptized or non-religious. Some Jack Mormons still support the goals and beliefs of the LDS Church, but for various reasons choose not to attend services or participate in church activities. They are also colloquially known as &quot;Cultural Mormons&quot;, the LDS equivalent of a lapsed Catholic, a &quot;Christmas and Easter Christian&quot;/ &quot;Sunday Christian&quot;(or based on an adage &quot;Once a Baptist, Always a Baptist&quot;) and a &quot;Yom Kippur Jew&quot; (or sometimes &quot;ethnic Jew&quot;).

Some modern LDS youth today use the term to describe a baptized member who chooses not to follow the ethical, moral and cultural guidelines common to Mormons. These guidelines include refraining from profanity and pre-marital sex. Other common cultural limitations include following the Word of Wisdom by consuming a healthy diet, seeking exercise, and avoiding the use of drugs, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee and tea. Often such individuals are noticeable for public consumption of tobacco or alcohol.

It is unclear how or why the meaning of the term changed to its current usage, which is almost the reverse of its original meaning. Preston Nibley, a mid-20th century LDS author who had a large impact on Mormon culture and folklore, mentioned the term in its modern context during the late 1940s and used it extensively in the 1950s.

==In popular culture==
The term &quot;Jack Mormon&quot; was used by author Edward Abbey in his novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; to describe a character, Seldom Seen Smith, who was a Mormon and had many wives, but was not active in the LDS Church nor its belief system: &quot;Born by chance into membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), Smith was on lifetime sabbatical from his religion. He was a jack Mormon. A jack Mormon is to a decent Mormon what a jackrabbit is to a cottontail.&quot;

In the play &quot;Angels in America&quot; by Tony Kushner, the character Harper Pitt identifies herself as a Jack Mormon, and postulates an alternate explanation for the origin of the term: &quot;Like jack rabbit...I ran.&quot;

In Episode 6 of Season 5 of the AMC television series &quot;Hell On Wheels&quot;, the character known as Eva identifies herself as a Jack Mormon to the Brigham Young character.

The term is used in its modern meaning by Wallace Stegner in his 1979 novel &quot;Recapitulation&quot;, set in Salt Lake City.

Jerry Joseph and the Jackmormons is a rock band from Portland, Oregon in the United States.

Jon Huntsman the Republican former Governor of Utah, and presidential contender in 2012, was described this way due to his distance from some LDS tenets.

Jack Mormon Coffee Company is a Salt Lake-based coffee roaster, located in the Historic Avenues district.

American actor Jason Cloud premiered a self-produced play titled &quot;Jack Mormon&quot; in December 2017 in Vienna, Austria.

<text>Football Club Urartu (, translated &quot;Futbolayin Akumb Urartu&quot;), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup four times, in 1992, 2007, 2016, and 2023. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.

In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.

==History==
===Kotayk===
Urartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of &quot;Banants&quot; (currently known as &quot;Bayan&quot;). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.

===Yerevan===

In 2001, FC Banants was relocated to Yerevan. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants&#x27;s youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.
Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club&#x27;s future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.

The club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan.

===Domestic===
===European===


==Stadium==
The construction of the Urartu Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).

===Training centre/academy===
Urartu Training Centre is the club&#x27;s academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.

==Fans==
The most active group of fans is the &quot;South West Ultras&quot; fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a &quot;de facto&quot; representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.

<doc id="833814" wikidata="Q1113479" url="?curid=833814" title="Gerald Hawkins">
<text>Gerald Stanley Hawkins (20 April 1928– 26 May 2003) was a British-born American astronomer and author noted for his work in the field of archaeoastronomy. A professor and chair of the astronomy department at Boston University in the United States, he published in 1963 an analysis of Stonehenge in which he was the first to propose that it was an ancient astronomical observatory used to predict movements of the sun and moon, and that it was used as a computer. Archaeologists and other scholars have since demonstrated such sophisticated, complex planning and construction at other prehistoric earthwork sites, such as Cahokia in the U.S.

==Early life and education==
Gerald Hawkins was born in Great Yarmouth, England and studied physics and mathematics at the University of Nottingham. In 1952 he took a PhD in radio astronomy, studying under Sir Bernard Lovell at the University of Manchester.

==Career==
In 1957 Hawkins became professor of astronomy and chairman of the department at Boston University in the United States. He wrote widely on numerous subjects, including tektites, meteors and the steady-state universe theory. Born in England, he became an American citizen in 1965.

===&quot;Splendor in the Sky&quot; (1961)===
Hawkins&#x27; first book, &quot;Splendor in the Sky&quot;, is a detailed overview of astronomy. It includes a conventional overview of the history of the field and discusses topics of interest such as the formation and evolution of the Solar System as well as the properties of distant galaxies. However, he dismisses the expansion of the universe from the Big Bang as a false notion, despite the evidence compelling science &quot;to adopt the expanding solution at the present epoch&quot;. His dismissal of the Big Bang was based on an alleged lack of &quot;remnants left behind at the seat of the explosion [at the] center of the universe&quot;. The cosmic microwave background, which fills space with no preference as to a center, was discovered in 1965 and provided strong evidence for the Big Bang model.

Hawkins acknowledges the age of Earth (over 4 billion years old) and the truth of Darwinism, and suggests the poetic compatibility of religious creation myths with cosmology. However, he also refers to the mythological Genesis flood narrative as a historical event that &quot;probably dates back to 4000 B.C.&quot; and suggests that a meteorite was sent by God to destroy the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He mentions the possible astronomical nature of Stonehenge, an idea he developed into a number of subsequent works.

===&quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot; (1965)===
Hawkins applied the technological resources of the university to studying the astronomical alignments of ancient megalithic sites. He fed the positions of standing stones and other features at Stonehenge into an early IBM 7090 computer and used the mainframe to model sun and moon movements. In his 1965 book, &quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot; (with John B. White), Hawkins argued that the various features at the monument were arranged in such a way as to predict a variety of astronomical events.

By interpreting Stonehenge as a giant prehistoric observatory and computer, Hawkins&#x27; work what had previously been seen as a primitive temple. The archaeological community was sceptical and his theories were criticized by such noted historians as Richard Atkinson, who denounced the book as being &quot;tendentious, arrogant, slipshod, and unconvincing&quot;.

&quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot; sold widely. It was especially popular among the members of 1960s counterculture, who found that it followed a similar &quot;wisdom of the ancients&quot; line explored by Alexander Thom. Hawkins&#x27; theories still inform popular opinion of Stonehenge. Although some archaeologists are cautious to accept Hawkins&#x27; theories, many archaeoastronomers have built upon his work. Many scholars accept that the importance of astronomical alignment and large complexes being planned and constructed to fulfill cosmology has been demonstrated at other prehistoric sites, such as the Snake Mound and Cahokia in the U.S.

Hawkins later examined the Nazca lines in Peru, and concluded there was not enough evidence to support an astronomical explanation for them. He also studied the temple of Amun at Karnak. He continued to study Stonehenge up until his death. In 1973, he published &quot;Beyond Stonehenge&quot;.

The American Astronomical Society stated in its obituary for Hawkins:

<doc id="833815" wikidata="Q506630" url="?curid=833815" title="Laws of the Game (association football)">
<text>The Laws of the Game are the codified rules of association football. The laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the offside law, and many other laws that define the sport. During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game.

There were various attempts to codify rules among the various types of football in the mid-19th century. The extant Laws date back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly formed Football Association (FA) and written by its first secretary, Ebenezer Cobb Morley. Over time, the Laws have been amended, and since 1886 they have been maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).

The Laws are the only rules of association football FIFA permits its members to use. The Laws currently allow some minor optional variations which can be implemented by national football associations, including some for play at the lowest levels, but otherwise almost all organised football worldwide is played under the same ruleset. Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.

== List of Laws==
The Laws of the Game consist of seventeen individual laws, each law containing several rules and directions:
* Law 1: The Field of Play
* Law 2: The Ball
* Law 3: The Players
* Law 4: The Players&#x27; Equipment
* Law 5: The Referee
* Law 6: The Other Match Officials
* Law 7: The Duration of the Match
* Law 8: The Start and Restart of Play
** Covers the kick-off and dropped-ball; other methods of restarting play are covered in other laws.
* Law 9: The Ball In and Out of Play
* Law 10: Determining the Outcome of a Match
* Law 11: Offside
* Law 12: Fouls and Misconduct
* Law 13: Free Kicks
* Law 14: The Penalty Kick
* Law 15: The Throw-in
* Law 16: The Goal Kick
* Law 17: The Corner Kick

=== Permitted variations ===
All high-level association football is played according to the same laws. The Laws permit some variation for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football, such as shortening the length of the game and the use of temporary dismissals. 

===Presentation and interpretation===
In 1997, a major revision dropped whole paragraphs and clarified many sections to simplify and strengthen the principles. These laws are written in English Common Law style and are meant to be guidelines and goals of principle that are then clarified through practice, tradition, and enforcement by the referees.

The actual law book had long contained 50 pages more of material, organised in numerous sections, that included many diagrams but were not officially part of the main 17 laws. In 2007, many of these additional sections along with much of the material from the FIFA Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A), were restructured and put into a new &quot;Additional Instructions and Guidelines for the Referee&quot; section. In the 2016/2017 revision of the Laws, the material from this section was folded into the Laws themselves.

Referees are expected to use their judgement and common sense in applying the laws; this is colloquially known as &quot;Law 18&quot;.

===Jurisdiction and change management===
The laws are administered by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). They meet at least once a year to debate and decide any changes to the text as it exists at that time. The meeting in winter generally leads to an update to the laws on 1 July of each year that take effect immediately. A minimum of six of the eight-seat IFAB board needs to vote to accept a rule change. Four seats are held by FIFA to represent their 200+ member Nations, with the other four going to each of the British associations (the FA representing England, the SFA representing Scotland, FAW representing Wales and the IFA representing Northern Ireland), meaning that no change can be made without FIFA&#x27;s approval, but FIFA cannot change the Laws without the approval of at least two of the British governing bodies.

==History==

===Pre-1863===

In the nineteenth century, the word &quot;football&quot; could signify a wide variety of games in which players attempted to move a ball into an opponent&#x27;s goal. The first published rules of &quot;football&quot; were those of Rugby School (1845), which permitted extensive handling, quickly followed by the Eton field game (1847), which was much more restrictive of handling the ball. Between the 1830s and 1850s, a number of sets of rules were created for use at Cambridge University – but they were generally not published at the time, and many have subsequently been lost. The first detailed sets of rules published by football &quot;clubs&quot; (rather than a school or university) were those of Sheffield F.C. (written 1858, published 1859) which codified a game played for 20 years until being discontinued in favour of the Football Association code, and those of Melbourne FC (1859) which are the origins of Australian rules football. By the time the Football Association met in late 1863, many different sets of rules had been published, varying widely on such questions as the extent to which the ball could be handled, the treatment of offside, the amount of physical contact allowed with opponents, and the height at which a goal could be scored.

===1863 rules===

In 1863, some football clubs followed the example of Rugby School by allowing the ball to be carried in the hands, with players allowed to &quot;hack&quot; (kick in the shins) opponents who were carrying the ball. Other clubs forbade both practices. During the FA meetings to draw up the first version of the laws, there was an acrimonious division between the &quot;hacking&quot; and &quot;non-hacking&quot; clubs. An FA meeting of 17 November 1863 discussed this question, with the &quot;hacking&quot; clubs predominating. A further meeting was scheduled in order to finalise (&quot;settle&quot;) the laws. At this crucial 24 November meeting, the &quot;hackers&quot; were again in a narrow majority. During the meeting, however, the FA&#x27;s secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley brought the delegates&#x27; attention to a recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University which banned carrying and hacking. Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final &quot;settlement&quot; of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December. A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting, resulting in hacking and carrying being banned.

Francis Campbell of Blackheath F.C., the most prominent &quot;hacking&quot; club, accused FA President Arthur Pember, Morley, and their allies of managing 24 November meeting improperly in order to prevent the &quot;pro-hacking&quot; laws from being adopted. Pember strongly denied such an &quot;accusation of ungentlemanly conduct&quot;. The verdicts of later historians have been mixed: Young accuses Campbell of &quot;arrogance&quot;, while Harvey supports Campbell&#x27;s allegations, accusing the non-hackers of a &quot;coup&quot; against the pro-hacking clubs. Blackheath, along with the other &quot;hacking&quot; clubs, would leave the FA as a result of this dispute.

The final version of the FA&#x27;s laws was formally adopted and published in December 1863. Some notable differences from the modern game are listed below:
* There was no crossbar. Goals could be scored at any height (as today in Australian rules football).
* While most forms of handling were forbidden, players were allowed to catch the ball (provided they did not run with it or throw it). A fair catch was rewarded with a free kick (a feature that today survives in various forms in Australian rules football, rugby union and American football).
* There was a strict offside rule, under which any player ahead of the kicker was in an offside position (similar to today&#x27;s offside rule in rugby union). The only exception was when the ball was kicked from behind the goal line.
* The throw-in was awarded to the first player (on either team) to touch the ball after it went out of play. The ball had to be thrown in at right-angles to the touchline (as today in rugby union).
* There was no corner-kick. When the ball went behind the goal-line, there was a situation somewhat similar to rugby: if an attacking player first touched the ball after it went out of play, then the attacking team had an opportunity to take a free kick at goal from a point fifteen yards behind the point where the ball was touched (somewhat similar to a conversion in rugby). If a defender first touched the ball, then the defending team kicked the ball out from on or behind the goal line (equivalent to the goal-kick).
* Teams changed ends every time a goal was scored.
* The rules made no provision for a goal-keeper, match officials, punishments for infringements of the rules, duration of the match, half-time, number of players, or pitch-markings (other than flags to mark the boundary of the playing area).

At its meeting on 8 December 1863, the FA agreed that, as reported in &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot;, John Lillywhite would publish the Laws. The first game to be played under the new rules occurred eleven days later between Barnes and Richmond.
Adoption of the laws was not universal among English football clubs. The Sheffield Rules continued to be used by many. Additionally, in preference for hacking as well as handling of the ball, several clubs, such as Blackheath, decided against being part of the FA in its early years and would later form the Rugby Football Union in 1871.

===IFAB created===
Minor variations between the rules used in England (the jurisdiction of the Football Association) and the other Home Nations of the United Kingdom – Scotland, Wales and Ireland – led to the creation of the International Football Association Board to oversee the rules for all the home nations. Their first meeting was in 1886. Before this, teams from different countries had to agree to which country&#x27;s rules were used before playing.

===FIFA adoption===
When the international football body on the continent FIFA was founded in Paris in 1904, it immediately declared that FIFA would adhere to the rules laid down by the IFAB. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. Up until 1958, it was still possible for the British associations to vote together to impose changes against the wishes of FIFA. This changed with the adoption of the current voting system whereby FIFA&#x27;s support is necessary, but not sufficient, for any amendment to pass.

===Notable amendments===

Notable amendments to the rules include:
* 1866 – The strict rugby-style offside rule is relaxed: a player is onside as long as there are three opponents between the player and the opposing goal. The award of a free kick for a fair catch (still seen in other football codes) is eliminated. A tape (corresponding to the modern crossbar) is added to the goals; previously goals could be scored at any height (as today in Australian rules football).
* 1867 – The situation when the ball goes behind the goal-line is simplified: all rugby-like elements are removed, with the defending team being awarded a goal-kick regardless of which team touched the ball.

* 1870 – All handling of the ball is forbidden (previously, players had been allowed to catch the ball). Teams change ends at half-time, but only if no goals were scored in the first half.
* 1871 – Introduction of the specific position of goalkeeper, who is allowed to handle the ball &quot;for the protection of his goal&quot;.
* 1872 – The indirect free kick is introduced as a punishment for a handball, the first mention of a punitive action for contravening the rules. The corner kick is introduced. Teams do not change ends after goals scored during the second half.
* 1873 – The throw-in is awarded against the team who kicked the ball into touch (previously it was awarded to the first player from either team to touch the ball after it went out of play). The goalkeeper may not &quot;carry&quot; the ball.
* 1874 – The indirect free kick, previously used only to punish handball, is extended to cover foul play and offside. The first reference to a match official (the &quot;umpire&quot;). Previously, team captains had generally been expected to enforce the laws.
* 1875 – A goal may not be directly scored from a corner-kick or from the kick-off. Teams change ends at half-time only. The goal may have either a crossbar or tape.
* 1877 – The throw-in may go in any direction (previously it had to be thrown in at right-angles to the touchline, as today in rugby union). As a result of this change, the clubs of the Sheffield Football Association agreed to abandon their own distinctive &quot;Sheffield Rules&quot; and adopt the FA laws.
* 1878 – A player can be offside from a throw-in.
* 1881 – The referee is introduced, to decide disputes between the umpires. The caution (for &quot;ungentlemanly behaviour&quot;) and the sending-off (for violent conduct) appear in the laws for the first time.
* 1883 – The International Football Conference, held between the English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh football associations in December 1882, resulted in the unification of the rules across the home nations, which entailed several changes to the FA&#x27;s laws the following year. The throw-in finally reaches its modern form, with players required to throw the ball from above the head using two hands. A player cannot be offside from a corner kick. The goalkeeper may take up to two steps while holding the ball. The goal must have a crossbar (the option of using tape is removed). The kick-off must be kicked forwards. The touch-line is introduced (previously, the boundary of the field of play had been marked by flags).
* 1887 – The goalkeeper may not handle the ball in the opposition&#x27;s half.
* 1888 – The drop ball is introduced as a means of restarting play after it has been suspended by the referee.
* 1889 – A player may be sent off for repeated cautionable behaviour.
* 1890 – A goal may not be scored directly from a goal kick.

* 1891 – The penalty kick is introduced, for handball or foul play within 12 yards of the goal line. The umpires are replaced by linesmen. Pitch markings are introduced for the goal area, penalty area, centre spot and centre circle.
* 1897 – The laws specify, for the first time, the number of players on each team (11) and the duration of each match (90 minutes, unless agreed otherwise). The half-way line is introduced. The maximum length of the ground is reduced from 200 yards to 130 yards.
* 1901 – Goalkeepers may handle the ball for any purpose (previously the goalkeeper was permitted to handle the ball only &quot;in defence of his goal&quot;).
* 1902 – The goal area and penalty area assume their modern dimensions, extending six yards and eighteen yards respectively from the goal posts. The penalty spot is introduced.
* 1903 – A goal may be scored directly from a free kick awarded for handball or foul play (previously all free-kicks awarded for infringements of the laws, other than penalty kicks, had been indirect). A referee may refrain from awarding a free kick or penalty in order to give advantage to the attacking team. A player may be sent off for &quot;bad or violent language to a Referee&quot;.
* 1907 – Players cannot be offside when in their own half.
* 1912 – The goalkeeper may handle the ball only in the penalty area.
* 1920 – A player cannot be offside from a throw-in.
* 1924 – A goal may be scored directly from a corner kick.
* 1925 – The offside rule is relaxed further: a player is onside as long as there are two opponents between the player and the opponents&#x27; goal-line (previously, three opponents had been required).
* 1931 – The goalkeeper may take four steps (rather than two) while carrying the ball.
* 1937 – The &quot;D&quot; is added to the pitch markings, to ensure that players do not encroach within 10 yards of the player taking a penalty kick. 
* 1938 – The laws are completely rewritten and reorganised by a committee under the leadership of Stanley Rous. The rewriting introduces the schema of seventeen laws that still exists today. A player may be sent off for &quot;serious foul play&quot;.
* 1958 – Substitutions of injured players is allowed in competitive matches for the first time, subject to national association approval.
* 1970 – Introduction of red and yellow cards.
* 1990 – A further relaxation of the offside law: a player level with the second-last opponent is considered onside (previously, such a player would have been considered offside). A player may be sent off for an offence that denies opponents a &quot;clear goalscoring opportunity&quot;.
* 1992 – Introduction of the back-pass rule: the goalkeeper may not handle the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to him/her by a teammate.
* 1993 - Introduction of the golden goal: if either team scored a goal during extra time in a competitive match, the game ends immediately and the scoring team becomes the winner. This rule remained in place until being removed from most competitions in 2004.
* 1997 – The rules are completely rewritten, for the first time since 1938. A goal may be scored directly from the kick-off or from a goal kick. The goalkeeper may not handle the ball after receiving it directly from a team-mate&#x27;s throw-in.
* 2000 – The four-step restriction on the goalkeeper handling the ball is repealed and replaced by the &quot;six-second rule&quot;: the goalkeeper may not handle the ball for more than six seconds. The goalkeeper may no longer be charged while holding the ball.
* 2004 – The golden goal rule is eliminated.
* 2012 – Goal-line technology permitted (but not required).
* 2016 – The kick-off may be kicked in any direction. Fouls from &quot;legitimate football challenges&quot; inside the penalty area that are a &quot;denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity&quot; reduced in punishment from a red card to a yellow card and the penalty kick for the foul. Fouls for &quot;stopping a promising attack&quot; inside the penalty area no longer attract a yellow card, only a penalty kick. These fouls can still be punished with a red or yellow card if deemed to be reckless, with excessive force or with brutality by the referee.
* 2017 – Prohibition on the use of electronic devices by coaching staff removed. Microphones, earpieces, mobile phones, tablets, watches and laptops are allowed for player welfare, safety &amp; tactical coaching reasons. Players remain restricted to use of electronic performance tracking systems, with no electronic communication devices allowed.
* 2018 – Video assistant referees permitted (but not required). A fourth substitution is permitted in extra time.
* 2019 – Goals scored by hand, whether accidental or not, are disallowed. Attacking players can no longer interfere in defensive walls during free kicks. Substituted players have to leave the field at the nearest goal line or touchline instead of walking to their technical area. Goal kicks put the ball into play immediately (instead of having to leave the penalty area). Team officials can also be cautioned or dismissed. During penalties, goalkeepers are only required to keep one foot on the line. The dropped ball is no longer competitive, instead being dropped for the defensive goalkeeper if in the penalty area, otherwise for the team which last touched the ball. Disallowance of goals scored by a throw from the goalkeeper introduced for all football, but mainly intended as a preventative measure in youth &amp; small pitch football played under official laws.
* 2022 - Increase in standard number of substitutions from 3 to 5 and introduction of 3 &quot;substitute windows&quot; teams can using during regulation play to make their changes. These two changes were introduced in a trial form during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable an easier recovery and return to football for players who contracted COVID.
* 2023 - &quot;Kicks from the penalty mark&quot; renamed to &quot;Penalties (penalty shoot-out)&quot;. Cautions in regulation play &amp; extra time are no longer carried forward into a penalty shootout. Expanded wording to clarify meaning regarding what &quot;deliberate play&quot; means in relation to an offside player receiving the ball from an opponent. Goal celebrations positively identified as a reason for additional playing time to be added. &quot;Downgrade&quot; on punishment for an offence which results in a penalty kick clarified to also apply to challenges on opponent in addition to attempts to play the ball.
* 2024 - Additional substitution and sub window allowed for one player per team who is believed to have received a concussion injury, with opposition given an additional substitution and sub window. Temporary dismissal (sin bin) protocols added for optional use outside professional football. Each team now requires a mandatory Captain who is identified with an armband. Penalty encroachment by players who aren&#x27;t the kicker or the goalkeeper only penalised if their encroachment impacted play after the penalty kick.

===Titles of the laws===

The 1938 rewriting of the laws introduced the scheme of 17 named laws that has lasted until today, with only minor alterations. The history of the numbering and titles of the laws since 1938 is shown in the table below:

<text>FC TVMK was an Estonian football club. TVMK won the Estonian Meistriliiga in 2005. They are also multiple winners of the Estonian Cup.

==History==

Founded in 1951, TVMK played in regional leagues until 1986, when the club eneterd the &quot;Jõgeva III division&quot;, winning promotion to the II liiga the same year. In 1988 TVMK reached the top flight of 1988 Estonian SSR Football Championship, that was not directly affiliated with Soviet Union football league system where Estonia was represented by SK Tallinna Sport and JK Tallinna Kalev.
 TVMK won the Estonian SSR

TVMK won two of the final seasons of the Estonian SSR Football Championship in 1990 and 1991 subsequently becoming one of the founding members of Estonian Meistriliiga as TVMV when the independent championship was first held in 1992, following the Soviet occupation.

Financial difficulties at TVMV parent company - the TVMV plywood-producing factory (known as TVMK for most of its history) put the club&#x27;s existence at risk following the 1992 season. The club was saved by sponsorship investments from the transport company Nikol AS.

Due to sponsorship reasons, TVMK played both the 1992-93 and 1993-94 seasons under the name of FC Nikol, securing Meistriliiga bronze medals on both occasions.

One game before the end of the 1993-94 season, newly-formed FC Tevalte was disqualified from Meistriliiga on match fixing allegations. Tevalte owner, Sergei Belov, filed a complaint against disqualification, but ultimately established a new club based on FC Nikol. The new club was named FC Lantana-Marlekor, where Marlekor was referring to the company that privatised the TVMK factory, a business with which FC TVMK was affiliated.

Despite using FC Nikol&#x27;s Meistriliiga license and referencing TVMK owners Marlekor AS in their name, Lantana-Marlekor was mostly formed out of former FC Tevalte players and was coached by Sergei Belov&#x27;s father, who had also coached FC Tevalte the season earlier. Most of the TVMK/Nikol players, including player-coach Vjatseslav Smirnov, left the club during this transition.

In the subsequent season, following Belov&#x27;s successful appeal to FIFA, the Estonian Football Association (EJL) reinstated FC Tevalte back to Meistriliiga. Since Sergei Belov was already operating his club under a new license and name, the slot regained by FC Tevalte was passed to AS Marlekor, effectively returning FC TVMK&#x27;s successors to Meistriliiga. Marlekor used Tevalte&#x27;s Meistriliiga license, and the team played the 1995-96 Meistriliiga season as Tevalte-Marlekor. Meanwhile, Lantana dropped the reference to Marlekor from their name. The return of TVMK&#x27;s successors to Meistriliiga saw many former TVMK/Nikol players, including player-coach Vjatseslav Smirnov, rejoin the team.

Tevalte-Marlekor finished the 1995–96 season in third place, level on point with FC Flora and six point behind FC Lantana. The following season Tevalte was dropped from the club&#x27;s name and the team continued under the name of Marlekor.

Ahead of the 1997-98 season, the club regained its historic name, FC TVMK. TVMK achieved limited success between 1997 and 1999, finishing either fifth or sixth in Meistriliiga. It was not until 2000 that TVMK secured Meistriliiga bronze medals. Subsequently, TVMK consistently won either silver or bronze during the five Meistriliiga seasons between 2000 and 2004, culminating in their first and last Meistriliiga championship in 2005.

===After the title===

After winning the title TVMK lost several key players to other clubs in the pre-season. Club top scorers Ingemar Teever and Tarmo Neemelo left to Sweden (although the latter would later return on loan, after a troubled start abroad), Maksim Smirnov and Deniss Malov left for rivals FC Levadia, Egidijus Juška returned to Lithuania. Vyacheslav Bulavin continued as the head coach, but was sacked in mid-season, with the former Russia international Sergei Yuran taking over. The fortunes didn&#x27;t change much though, and the highlights of the season were winning the Estonian Cup and Estonian Super Cup, as the club finished only fourth in the league. The following season Yuran left for Shinnik Yaroslavl. Vjatšeslav Smirnov took over and led the team to a third-place finish in the league. After the 2007 season Pjotr Sedin, the chairman, announced that the club is currently considering a possibility of giving up their professional status, because of financial difficulties.

FC TVMK licence was revoked following the 2007 season.

<text>Erich Loest (; 24 February 1926 – 12 September 2013) was a German writer born in Mittweida, Saxony. He also wrote under the pseudonyms Hans Walldorf, Bernd Diksen and Waldemar Naß.

==Life and career==
He was a conscripted soldier in World War II and a Nazi Party member, he was captured by US troops in 1945. 
In 1947 he joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and became a journalist for the Leipziger Volkszeitung. His first novels were heavily criticized, he was dismissed from the Volkszeitung and became a freelance writer. In 1957 he lost his SED membership and was held as a prisoner in a Stasi prison in Bautzen for &quot;konterrevolutionärer Gruppenbildung (counter-revolutionary grouping)&quot; until 1964, during which period he was prohibited from writing.

From 1965 to 1975, he wrote eleven novels and 30 short stories, some under pseudonyms. In 1979 he was ostracized from East Germany and did not return until after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990.

In 1995, Frank Beyer directed the film &quot;Nikolaikirche&quot;, which was written, at first, as a screenplay by Loest, who later made it a novel. In his later years, Loest became seriously ill and announced at an Academy of Arts ceremony in 2010 that he did not have the strength to write another novel. On 12 September 2013, he committed suicide by jumping from a second-floor hospital window. He was 87 years old.

<text>FC Santa Coloma is an Andorran professional football club based in Santa Coloma, parish of Andorra la Vella, that competes in the Primera Divisió. It is the most successful team in both Primera Divisió and Copa Constitució, having won both titles thirteen and ten times respectively.

==History==

Fútbol Club Santa Coloma was founded in 1986 through the efforts of a group of football enthusiasts who represented the village of the same name that belongs to Andorra la Vella in the National Football Tournament (the former amateur league of Andorra). Later on FC Santa Coloma became one of the founder members of Primera Divisió in 1995. Since 2001 the club has enjoyed a great success in all Andorran competitions standing with all the records in the Premier Andorran League (13) and Andorran Cup (10).

At the end of 2017, the Spanish La Liga Villarreal CF team announced a collaboration agreement with the Andorran club at grassroots football level.

In July 2022, Gold Star Sports Management Group, led by Ukrainian-American entrepreneur, Daniel Milstein, completed the acquisition of the club. With Milstein as chairman, he announced Alex Lubyansky as CEO and Annabel Llevot as the General Manager. FC Santa Coloma and Gold Star FC Detroit are both under the Gold Star Football Club group of clubs.

==FC Santa Coloma in Europe==
FC Santa Coloma has two unique achievements for an Andorran team in European competitions: it was both the first team from Andorra to win a match in any European competition and the first team from Andorra that did not concede a goal in a match in a European competition.

Both of these feats were achieved on three occasions: the first match in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup qualifying round against the Israeli side Maccabi Tel Aviv, in which FC Santa Coloma won 1–0 at home with a goal scored by Juli Fernandez, then in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League First qualifying round when they beat Banants of Armenia 1–0, and in the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League Second qualifying, in which FC Santa Coloma won 1–0 at home against Valur of Iceland. On the first and last occasion, in the return leg they lost 4–0 to Maccabi and 3–0 to Valur, thus FC Santa Coloma were eliminated from the tournament.

Against Banants, they lost the second leg away in Armenia 3–2, however the game finished 3–3 on aggregate and FC Santa Coloma won by the away goals rule, thanks to a last minute goal by goalkeeper Eloy Casals. It was the second time an Andorran club won a two-legged tie in Europe after Sant Julià.

The 2023–24 season saw FC Santa Coloma claim another first - becoming the first Andorran team to navigate two European two-legged ties in the same season. Entering at the first qualifying round of the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League, they eliminated Welsh club Penybont F.C., then Montenegrin club FK Sutjeska Nikšić, to reach the third qualifying round against Dutch club AZ.

==Colours and badge==
FC Santa Coloma dressed in all white all the seasons since the creation of the Andorran Premier League, alternating the home kit with red or blue. Traditionally, the away kit has been all blue and third kit all red. However the original first kit at the beginning of the foundation of the club was blue and gives the nickname of &quot;Blues&quot;. In the club crest feature the colours of Andorra and the Holy Dove that gives the name of the Santa Coloma d&#x27;Andorra town and therefore the name of the club.
* &quot;Since the Andorra Football Federation affiliation.&quot;

==Club rivalries==

===&quot;El Clàssic&quot;===
The main rival of FC Santa Coloma in Primera Divisió has been always Sant Julià playing in a derby called &quot;El Clàssic&quot;. Both teams are strong in the Andorran Premier League and since the creation of the championship the clubs have been competing for being the champion of the top flight.

===&quot;El Derbi Colomenc&quot;===
The local rival of FC Santa Coloma is actually their neighbour&#x27;s hometown football team UE Santa Coloma. The rivalry between these two teams has increased since the 2009/10 season when those teams were competing for winning the Premier Andorran League.

<doc id="833834" wikidata="Q4718102" url="?curid=833834" title="Alexander's Bridge">
<text>Alexander&#x27;s Bridge is the first novel by American author Willa Cather. First published in 1912, it was re-released with an author&#x27;s preface in 1922. It also ran as a serial in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, giving Cather some free time from her work for that magazine.

==Plot introduction==
Bartley Alexander is a construction engineer and world-renowned builder of bridges undergoing a mid-life crisis. Although married to Winifred, Bartley resumes his acquaintance with a former lover, Hilda Burgoyne, in London. The affair gnaws at Bartley&#x27;s sense of propriety and honor.

==Plot summary==
Professor Wilson arrives at the Alexanders&#x27; house in Boston, Bartley Alexander having persuaded him to attend a Congress of Psychologists in the city. He is greeted by Winifred Alexander. When her husband comes home the men talk; Winifred plays the piano for them. The next day, she tells Wilson how she met her husband through her aunt.

On Christmas Eve, the Alexanders prepare for Christmas dinner. Bartley tells Wilson he is having trouble with a bridge in Canada. Later he gives his wife pearl earrings. On New Year&#x27;s Day, Alexander makes ready to leave for London. On the ship, he endures sharp gales and goes into a bar, where he gambles at bridge, the card game. In London, Bartley visits Hilda and tells her he cannot go on having two relationships; she must forget about him and leave him alone. She is distressed. The day before he is due to return to America however, he takes her out to dinner.

Later, Hugh MacConnell walks Hilda back to her house on a foggy day. She says she isn&#x27;t attracted to him; they are just close friends. In her house, she receives a letter from Bartley, saying he is going mad away from her. This prompts her to visit him in America to tell him she will marry another man; Bartley doesn&#x27;t like the idea. They spend one last evening together.

Soon afterward, Philip Horton calls Bartley to Canada to inspect the bridge. Bartley discovers that one of the lower chords is failing, compromising the structural integrity of the entire bridge. Horton had been concerned that the bridge was not safe and had attempted to contact Bartley to have him inspect the bridge earlier – on the very day Bartley was with Hilda. While Bartley is on the bridge telling the work crews to stop working because the bridge was unsafe, the bridge collapses, killing Bartley and many of the workers. Bartley&#x27;s body is recovered the next day and taken to Horton&#x27;s house. Winifred comes back to make arrangements for her husband&#x27;s corpse. Finally, Wilson visits Hilda. The latter expresses her envy of Winifred. Wilson reminds her that Winifred is now bereft and will be haunted by Bartley&#x27;s death. Hilda concludes that she will be too.

<text>A blood lancet, or simply lancet, is a small medical implement used for capillary blood sampling. A blood lancet, sometimes called a lance, is similar to a scalpel style lancet, but with a double-edged blade and a pointed end. It can even be a specialized type of sharp needle. Lancets are used to make punctures, such as a fingerstick, to obtain small blood specimens. Blood lancets are generally disposable.

Lancets are also used to prick the skin in dermatological testing for allergies.

A blood-sampling device, also known as a lancing device, is an instrument equipped with a lancet. It is also most commonly used by diabetic patients during blood glucose monitoring. The depth of skin penetration can be adjusted for various skin thicknesses. Long lancing devices are used for fetal scalp blood testing to get a measure of the acid base status of the fetus.

==Blood sampling==

The small capillary blood samples obtained can be tested for blood glucose, hemoglobin, and many other blood components.

<text>Fudbalski klub Modriča (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Модрича), known as Alfa Modriča for sponsorship reasons, is a professional football club based in Modriča that is situated in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The club was founded in 1922 and it is currently active in the Second League of the Republika Srpska. The club plays its home matches at the Dr. Milan Jelić Stadium, which has a capacity of 6,000 seats.

Modriča became champions in the First League of RS in the 2002–03 season, which secured them a place in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club&#x27;s big success came in the 2003–04 season when it won the national cup. Due to this victory, Modriča qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup tournament. It played against FC Santa Coloma of Andorra and won both games, but was later knocked out by Bulgarian side PFC Levski Sofia.

However, its biggest success was when it won the 2007–08 Bosnian Premier League and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds where they played against FK Dinamo Tirana and Aalborg BK.

The club is sponsored by Meridianbet.

== History ==
The origins of Modriča&#x27;s history of professional sports are connected to football, and they date back to 1921.

The first football was brought from Prague by a student Đoka Petrović. The first football club was founded in Modriča in 1922.
The club was originally named Rogulj, but it soon changed its name to Zora. In the first years of development of the sport, there were no official competitions – only friendly matches played between teams from neighbouring locations, and the players purchased sports equipment for themselves alone. The first official match Zora played was against the neighbouring team of &quot;Bosanac&quot; from Bosanski Šamac in 1923, which resulted in a 2–2 draw.

Zora existed up until 1927, when the authorities forbade its operation. Soon after, however, another club was founded under the name Olimpija, which existed under this name until 1938, when it changed its name to FK Dobor. After the beginning of World War II, all sports activities ceased, and only when the war was over, in August 1945, a new football club was founded, named Sloga. The club later changed its name to Napredak until it finally got the name Modriča. For sponsoring reasons, Modriča later received for a long time the surname Maxima. What was later changed again in summer 2017 because of sponsor change to Alfa.

The biggest successes of the club during the years of the former Yugoslavia were in the season 1968/69, when it won first place and the title of amateur champion of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the second place in the competition for amateur champion of Yugoslavia.

The shirt of FK Modriča Maxima has been worn, among others, by: Nikola Nikić, Goran Peleš, Džemal Đedović, Slavko Cvijić, Dragan Voćkić, Rade Radulović, Slavko Mamuzić and Mustafa Čoralić. Coaches FK Modriča Maxima Dušan Radoja, Mitar Lukić, Slaviša Božičić, Zoran Ćurguz, Nikola Nikić, Marko Stojić.

The 2003–04 season saw Modriča&#x27;s first participation in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The same season saw Modriča lift the Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup on 26 May 2004.

In the 2007–08 season, Modriča won its first and so far only league title, which ranks as the biggest success in the long history of the club.

== Stadium ==

The stadium was built and opened in 1962. FK Modriča was formed in 1922 as a club and played its home games at Vranjak.

At the time, the stadium was mainly built with wooden stands and could have an attendance of 3,000 spectators. Modriča, being an industrial city and having the oil refinery as the main provider for most of the population of the city, needed to provide some kind of job offer for its hard workers.

Now, the decision was made to build a larger stadium since FK Modriča was taking part in the country&#x27;s top league.
The stadium &quot;Dr. Milan Jelić&quot; was named after the former president of Republika Srpska. After Dr. Milan Jelić&#x27;s death on 30 September 2007, the club decided to change the name of their stadium in his honour. The stadium has changing rooms, offices for the hosts, chairs for its main stand, and the capacity altogether is 6,000.

Dinamo Tbilisi was one of the most prominent clubs in Soviet football and a major contender in the Soviet Top League almost immediately after it was established in 1936. The club was then part of one of the leading sport societies in the Soviet Union, the All-Union Dynamo sports society which had several other divisions besides football and was sponsored by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its main claim to European fame was winning the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1981, beating FC Carl Zeiss Jena of East Germany 2–1 in the final in Düsseldorf. It remains the only club based in Georgia to have ever lifted a trophy in European competition. Throughout its history, FC Dinamo Tbilisi produced many famous Soviet players: Boris Paichadze, Avtandil Gogoberidze, Shota Iamanidze, Mikheil Meskhi, Slava Metreveli, Murtaz Khurtsilava, Manuchar Machaidze, David Kipiani, Vladimir Gutsaev, Aleksandre Chivadze, Vitaly Daraselia, Ramaz Shengelia, and Tengiz Sulakvelidze. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it would later produce some of the finest Georgian players such as Temur Ketsbaia, Shota Arveladze, Giorgi Kinkladze, Kakha Kaladze, Levan Kobiashvili, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Giorgi Mamardashvili etc.

Dinamo Tbilisi was one of a handful of teams in the Soviet Top League (along with Dynamo Kyiv and Dynamo Moscow) that were never relegated. Their most famous coach was Nodar Akhalkatsi, who led the team to the Soviet title in 1978, two Soviet Cups (1976 and 1979), and the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1981. He was also one of three co-coaches of the Soviet Union national football team during the FIFA World Cup in 1982. FC Dinamo Tbilisi are also 16–time Georgian league champions and 13–time Georgian Cup holders (the current records).

==History==

===The beginning: 1920s===
The history of FC Dinamo Tbilisi began in autumn 1925 when the Dinamo sports society set out to form a football club, at a time when football was gradually becoming one of the greatest and most popular sports in the world.

In 1927, FC Dinamo Tbilisi established a Junior club, &quot;Norchi Dinamoeli&quot; (young Dinamo). The Juniors club provided the senior with many young skillful players, including the first goalkeeper who played for Dinamo in the USSR championship, the first captain Shota Savgulidze, defender Mikhail Minaev, forward Vladimer Berdzenishvili and other famous players.

In the early years, no official championship existed in Georgia, so the teams played friendly games against each other. The first match was played with Azerbaijan team Dinamo Baku on 26 January 1926, with the more experienced Azerbaijan squad winning 1–0. The Dinamo team starred: D. Tsomaia, A. Pochkhua, M. Blankman, I. Fedorov, N. Anikin, A. Gonel, A. Pivovarov, O. Goldobin, A. Galperin, S. Maslenikov, and V. Tsomaia.

Three days later, Dinamo played another Azerbaijani team, &quot;Progress&quot;, and easily beat them 3–0.

Despite their success in the middle years of the 1930s, the Football Federation of the Soviet Union placed FC Dinamo Tbilisi in the first league instead of the Top League. Dinamo continued to show good form against the top teams, winning 9–5 in Tbilisi against probably the best team in the USSR championship, Dynamo Moscow. They later beat Dinamo Leningrad 3–2, winning 5 matches out of 6 plus a draw against Stalinec Moscow. This was enough for Dinamo to qualify for the top league.

===World War II: 1930s and 1940s===
The second championship started in autumn 1936. Altogether Dinamo played 1424 matches in the Soviet Union Championship. The first match was against Dynamo Kyiv, finishing 2–2, with goals by Nikolas Somov and Boris Paichadze. The team sheet was: A. Dorokhov, S. Shavgulidze (E. Nikolaishvili), B. Berdzenishvili, N. Anikin, V. Jorbenadze, G. Gagua, I. Panin, M. Berdzenishvili, B. Paichadze, M. Aslamazov, and N. Somov.

The first victory in the USSR championship was in the match against Spartak Moscow on 25 September with Mikheil Berdzenishvili scoring the winning goal. Dinamo finished the season in 3rd place. They challenged for the title, but this faded after the 2–3 loss against Krasnaia Zaria Leningrad. Dinamo also played an unforgettable match in Moscow against Spartak Moscow in the Soviet Cup quarter-final, when Dinamo beat them 6–3. They reached the first edition of the Soviet Cup final, but lost 0–2 to Lokomotiv Moscow. Their first international match was against the Spanish team Baskonia in 1937, which Dinamo lost 0–2.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Dinamo was one of the top Soviet football teams, even though they did not win a title. They were often referred to as the &quot;crownless champions&quot; with the team including S. Shavgulidze, A. Dorokhov, S. Shudra, B. Frolov, M. Berdzenishvili, A. Kiknadze, V. Paniukov, V. Berezhnoi, G. Gagua, V. Jorbenadze, and G. Jejelava.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, the team was led by Avtandil Gogoberidze who spent 17 years with Dinamo. He still holds the record for games played and goals scored for Dinamo, with 341 matches and 127 goals. In the same period, the following players starred for Dinamo: G. Antadze, Vladimer Marghania, N. Dziapshipa, M. Minaev, A. Zazroev, V. Eloshvili, and Avtandil Chkuaseli.

A prominent place in Dinamo history belongs to Andro Jordania, a coach who is considered as one most important figures in the club&#x27;s history. His period in charge was seen as &quot;the Renaissance&quot; of Dinamo&#x27;s traditions, which laid the ground for the major successes connected with his name. The club&#x27;s Digomi practice ground is named after him.

===First Soviet successes: 1960s===
The first major success came in the 1964 Soviet Top League when Dinamo won the Soviet Top League, with the team unbeaten in the last 15 matches. At the end, Dinamo was tied with Torpedo Moscow so the teams played an additional match in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, which Dinamo won 4–1. Georgian supporters celebrated the victory by naming their team &quot;Golden Guys&quot;.

A popular French magazine, &quot;France Football&quot;, wrote: &quot;Dinamo has great players. Their technique, skills, and playing intellect enables us to name them the best Eastern representatives of &#x27;South American Football Traditions&#x27;. If Dinamo were able to participate in the UEFA European Cup, we are certain, they would bring the hegemony of Spanish-Italian teams to an end.&quot; However, no Soviet team appeared in the European Cup at that time.

The line-up of the winning team in 1964 was: Sergo Kotrikadze, Giorgi Sichinava, Guram Petriashvili, Jemal Zeinklishvili, Guram Tskhovrebov, Vakhtang Rekhviashvili, Shota Iamanidze, Slava Metreveli, Vladimer Barkaia, Mikheil Meskhi, Ilia Datunashvili, and Alexander Apshev. Coach: Gavriil Kachalin.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the quality of the Dinamo team was further enhanced by several skillful players: Mikheil Meskhi, Slava Metreveli, Murtaz Khurtsilava, Revaz Dzodzuashvili, Kakhi Asatiani, Gocha Gavasheli, Guram Petriashvili, Piruz Kanteladze, and the Nodia brothers, Givi and Levan.

===European years: 1970s===
Dinamo&#x27;s first appearance in Europe was in 1972 against Dutch team Twente in the UEFA Cup. Dinamo won the game 3–2, with two goals scored by Givi Nodia and one by David Kipiani. The following players appeared on the field in this historic match: David Gogia, Revaz Dzodzuashvili, Vakhtang Chelidze, Murtaz Khurtsilava, Shota Khinchagashvili, Guram Petriashvili, Manuchar Machaidze, Kakhi Asatiani, Vladimir Gutsaev, Levan Nodia, Givi Nodia, and David Kipiani. In the second match Twente won the game 2–0 and progressed to the next round.

In 1973 Dinamo won their first International tournament. After beating Atlético Madrid and Benfica, the club won the Columbus&#x27;s Caravela Trophy.

In 1976 Nodar Akhalkatsi was appointed as Dinamo&#x27;s head coach. It was under his leadership that Dinamo achieved greatest success. The club was referred to as the &quot;Great Team&quot; between 1976 and 1982, characterised by a mobile, fast and technical style of play.

In this period Dinamo won the Soviet Cup for the first time in their history, convincingly defeating Armenian side Ararat Yerevan 3–0 in the final, with goals scored by David Kipiani, Piruz Kanteladze and Revaz Chelebadze. In 1978 the club won the Soviet Top League for a second time. Next year Dinamo won the Soviet Cup again by defeating Russian side Dynamo Moscow in the final. In 1979 the club played its first match in the UEFA European Cup tournament. In the first round Dinamo knocked out English side Liverpool, at the time one of the strongest teams in European football. After losing the first match at Anfield 1–2, Dinamo comfortably beat the opponent 3–0 in Tbilisi and advanced to the next round, where they were eliminated by German champions Hamburg. In the 1970s Dinamo also eliminated famous Italian sides Inter Milan and Napoli in European competitions.





===Last Soviet days: 1980s===

The highlight of Dinamo&#x27;s history was winning the 1980–81 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, including knocking out clubs like West Ham United (4–1, 0–1) and Feyenoord Rotterdam (3–0, 0–2), and beating East German side Carl Zeiss Jena 2–1 in the final on 13 May 1981. Vitaly Daraselia and Vladimir Gutsaev scored goals in the final.

Helmut Schön, 1974 FIFA World Cup winning coach said: &quot;It is to be said directly, Dinamo deserved the victory. This team has top-quality performers.&quot;

Next year in 1982 as reigning champions Dinamo advanced to the semi-finals in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup tournament, where they were eliminated by Belgian side Standard Liège. In the 1980s numerous skillful players appeared on the team, but for various reasons they were not able to do their best: Grigol Tsaava, Mikheil Meskhi (Junior), Otar Korghalidze, Gia Guruli, Mamuka Pantsulaia, Merab Jordania, Levan Baratashvili and many other talented players.

In 1983 a crisis began. It was hard for the club to go through the first rounds of the Soviet Cup. They also performed poorly in the championship. From 1983 to 1989 the team appeared only once in the UEFA tournaments.

Dinamo Tbilisi played its last game in the Soviet Top League on 27 October 1989 against Dynamo Kyiv. Dinamo played its first and last official matches in the Soviet championship with Dynamo Kyiv, with both matches ending 2–2.

===1990s===
In 1990 the Georgian Football Federation refused to participate in the Soviet Union championship. That meant that no Georgian football clubs would appear in Soviet tournaments. From that moment the more recent history of FC Dinamo Tbilisi began.

During this time, as a means of distancing from the Soviet past, the club was renamed Iberia Tbilisi. This move was largely opposed by the supporters and by 1992 the club reverted to its initial name.

The club played its first match in the Georgian National championship against Kolkheti Poti on 30 March 1990. Dinamo lost the historic match, 0–1. Ultimately the club recovered from this setback and won the first Georgian National championship. The club also won the next 9 championships.

In 1992 came Dinamo&#x27;s first double: the team won the league and the Georgian Cup, beating Tskhumi Sokhumi in the final. In 1993 Dinamo played its first international official match representing independent Georgia. Dinamo won the home match against Linfield 2–1, with goals from Shota Arveladze and Gela Inalishvili. The second leg in Belfast ended 1–1. However the club was disqualified for attempting to bribe the referee in the first leg.

Despite continued success in national cups and championships, the club had no success in European club tournaments.

In 1996 Dinamo passed 3 rounds in the UEFA Cup. They beat CS Grevenmacher 4–0, 2–2, Molde FK 2–1, 0–0 and Torpedo Moscow 1–0, 1–1. In the next round the club was unable to overcome Portuguese side Boavista and left the tournament.

Dinamo came very close to advancing in the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League group stages, but were eliminated by Athletic Bilbao on the away goals rule, 2–1, 0–1. The migration of key players to European clubs caused negative results. It became harder and harder for the club to win the Georgian Championship or Georgian Cup.

===2000s===
In the early 2000s, famous Georgian businessman Badri Patarkatsishvili purchased FC Dinamo Tbilisi. In 2003 the club won the Georgian Championship and Georgian Cup.

In 2004 Dinamo, under the leadership of Croatian coach Ivo Šušak, won the CIS Cup in Moscow, beating Latvian side Skonto 3–1 in the final. In the same year, Dinamo successfully made it through the UEFA Cup qualifying rounds, after defeating BATE Borisov (1–0, 3–2), Slavia Prague (2–0, 1–3) and Wisła Kraków (2–1, 3–4) and qualified for the group stage, where their opponents were Newcastle United, Sporting CP, Sochaux and Panionios. Dinamo lost all four games and finished bottom in the group.

In the following season Dinamo were again Georgian champions and they won the Georgian championship again in 2008, when the head coach of Dinamo was Czech Dušan Uhrin.

In 2009 the club beat Olimpi Rustavi and won the Georgian Cup.

===2010s===
In January 2011, FC Dinamo Tbilisi was purchased by Georgian businessman Roman Pipia. That year, the club successfully played in the UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds, but they were not able to overcome AEK Athens in the play-off round.

After a bad performance in the Georgian championship of 2011–12, Dinamo could not qualify for any UEFA competitions for the first time.
The new owner immediately started the modernization of the club starting with the reconstruction of the Digomi training ground. The Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena was reconstructed as well. The pitch surface was changed with a new specially adapted surface for the local climate. Renovated Youths Football Academy also began.

The club were beaten 5–0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League play-off round in the 1st leg and again 3–0 the following week at White Hart Lane, thus crashing out 8–0 on aggregate.

After that in national competitions Dinamo won the double in the 2013, 2014 and 2016 seasons.

==Stadium==
Construction of the Dinamo stadium started in autumn 1929 although the project was soon suspended. The construction was renewed in 1933 (chief architect – Archil Kurdiani). Construction is completed on 12 October 1935 with a maximum capacity of 23,000 spectators.

In 1960–1962 the stadium was reconstructed and the number of spectators increased to 36 000. After reconstruction the stadium was officially opened on 27 July 1962. Dinamo Tbilisi hosted FC Dynamo Leningrad in the Soviet championship and defeated it with minimal score 1–0.

The demand for a new and bigger stadium had increased due to the successful performance of Dinamo Tbilisi. This was the Communist time, when every problem had to be solved by the USSR supreme government body. The leader and the first secretary of Georgian Communist Party Eduard Shevardnadze was able to persuade official Moscow, that Georgia needed a bigger and better stadium for home matches. By the time the stadium was built, it had the third biggest capacity in the Soviet Union. It could fit 78,000 supporters and fulfill every standard and requirement of the Soviet Football Federation as well as the UEFA.

The first official match played after the stadium was built occurred on 29 September 1976. This was the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup 1/16 final match between Dinamo Tbilisi and Cardiff City. Dinamo won the opening game 3–0.

The next reconstruction of the stadium was held in 2006 (architects-Gia Kurdiani and Archil Kurdiani Junior) and the number of spectators was changed to 54,549. The stadium was opened with the European championship qualifying match. On 6 September 2006 the Georgia national team hosted the France national team and was defeated with the score 3–0. In 2012 the turf of Dinamo Arena was changed. Energy and irrigation systems were also fully rehabilitated. There was new lighting to satisfy demands for high standards. The VIP box was fully changed and fixed according to UEFA standards.

Even though the stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity was 78,000, Georgian football fans can remember matches with more accommodation. For instance, in 1979 Dinamo was hosting one of the best British teams – Liverpool. The first match was played in England at Anfield, and Liverpool won 2–1. The attendance was 110,000 and their support played an important role in winning. Dinamo beat Liverpool 3–0 and qualified in the next round. In the Soviet Union Dinamo stadium kept the record with an average attendance of 45,000.

The record attendance was repeated in 1995 for Georgia vs Germany. The football clubs Spartak Moscow and Dynamo Kyiv often played their autumn international matches at this stadium.

Hundreds of Georgian, European and even South American stars played in Dinamo stadium. In 1985 the stadium hosted the qualifying stage of the Juniors World Cup. Cláudio Taffarel and Muller played for the Brazil national team.

In 1995 the stadium was renamed Boris Paichadze National Stadium after a major Georgian international footballer. It is home to the Georgia national football team.
Holding lit torches, 80,000 fans came in 1981 to congratulate the team on their European Cup Winners Cup triumph.

The stadium hosted the 2015 UEFA Super Cup match between Barcelona and Sevilla. Barcelona won 5–4 in extra time.

<text>Anna Seghers (; born &quot;Anna Reiling,&quot; 19 November 1900 – 1 June 1983), is the pseudonym of German writer Anna Reiling, who was notable for exploring and depicting the moral experience of the Second World War. Born into a Jewish family and married to a Hungarian Communist, Seghers escaped Nazi-controlled territory through wartime France. She was granted a visa and gained ship&#x27;s passage to Mexico, where she lived in Mexico City (1941–47).

She returned to Europe after the war, living in West Berlin (1947–50), which was occupied by Allied forces. She eventually settled in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where she worked on cultural and peace issues. She received numerous awards and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1959, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1972.

She is believed to have based her pseudonym, Anna Seghers, on the surname of the Dutch painter and printmaker Hercules Pieterszoon Seghers or Segers (c. 1589 – c. 1638).

== Life ==
Seghers was born Anna Reiling in Mainz in 1900 into a Jewish family. She was called &quot;Netty&quot;. Her father, Isidor Reiling, was a dealer in antiques and cultural artefacts. In Cologne and Heidelberg she studied history, the history of art, and Chinese.

In 1925 she married László Radványi, also known as Johann Lorenz Schmidt, a Hungarian Communist and academic, thereby acquiring Hungarian citizenship.

She joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1928, at a time when the Weimar Republic was moribund and soon to be replaced. Her 1932 novel, &quot;Die Gefährten&quot; was a prophetic warning of the dangers of Nazism, for which she was arrested by the Gestapo. In 1932, she formally left the Jewish community.
By 1934 she had emigrated, via Zürich, to Paris. After German troops invaded the French Third Republic in 1940, she fled to Marseilles, seeking to leave Europe.

One year later, she was granted an entry visa to Mexico and ship&#x27;s passage. Settling in Mexico City, she founded the anti-fascist &#x27;Heinrich-Heine-Klub&#x27;, named after the German Jewish poet Heinrich Heine. She also founded &quot;Freies Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Free Germany&quot;), an academic journal.

While still in Paris, in 1939, she had written &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot;. The novel is set in 1936 and describes the escape of seven prisoners from a concentration camp. It was published in English in the United States in 1942 and quickly adapted for an American movie of the same name. &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; was one of the very few depictions of Nazi concentration camps, in either literature or the cinema, during World War II. In 1947 Seghers was awarded the Georg Büchner-Prize for this novel.

Seghers&#x27;s best-known short story, the title of her collection in &quot;The Outing of the Dead Girls&quot; (1946), was written in Mexico. It was partially autobiographical, drawn from her reminiscence and reimagining of a pre-World War I class excursion on the Rhine river. She explores the actions of the protagonist&#x27;s classmates in light of their decisions and ultimate fates during both world wars. In describing them, the German countryside, and her hometown Mainz, which was soon destroyed in the second war, Seghers expresses lost innocence and ponders the senseless injustices of war. She shows there is no escape from such loss, whether or not one sympathized with the Nazi Party. Other notable Seghers novels include &quot;Sagen von Artemis&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Ship of the Argonauts&quot; (1953), both based on myths.

In 1947, Seghers returned to Germany, settling in West Berlin, an enclave within the Soviet-controlled East Germany. She joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the zone occupied by the Soviets. That year she was also awarded the Georg Büchner Prize for her novel &quot;Transit&quot;, written in German, and published in English in 1944.

In 1950, she moved to East Berlin, where she co-founded the Academy of the Arts of the GDR, and became a member of the World Peace Council.

Her radio play &quot;The Trial of Joan of Arc at Rouen, 1431&quot; was adapted to the stage by Bertolt Brecht. It was written in collaboration with Benno Besson and premiered at the Berliner Ensemble in November 1952, in a production directed by Besson (his first important production with the Ensemble), with Käthe Reichel as Joan.

==Honors and awards==
In 1951, Seghers received the first National Prize of the GDR and the Stalin Peace Prize. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena in 1959. Seghers was nominated for the 1967 Nobel Prize in Literature by the German Academy of Arts. In 1981, she was made an honorary citizen of her native town Mainz. She died in Berlin on 1 June 1983 and is buried there.

==Representation in other media==
*&quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944) was adapted in English from her 1942 novel of the same name and released by MGM, starring Spencer Tracy.
*Anna Seghers is mentioned in the German ostalgie film, &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; (2003), directed by Wolfgang Becker.
*Her novel published as &quot;Transit&quot; (1944) in English, set in Marseilles, was adapted for a 2018 film of the same name by German director Christian Petzold. It was set in contemporary Marseilles, again a center of refugees.

== Selected works ==
Anna Seghers&#x27;s earlier works are typically attributed to the New Objectivity movement. She also made a number of important contributions to Exilliteratur, including her novels &quot;Transit&quot; and &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot;. Her later novels, published in the GDR, are often associated with socialist realism. A number of her novels have been adapted into films in Germany. In 2021, a collection of her short stories was published in English by NYRB Classics.

<text>Neftçi Peşəkar Futbol Klubu, known simply as Neftçi () or Neftchi Baku, is an Azerbaijani professional football club based in the capital Baku, that plays in the Azerbaijan Premier League, the highest tier of Azerbaijan football. The club was founded on 18 March 1937 and played under the name of Neftyanik until 1968. Since then, the club has been competing under the name of Neftçi.

Neftçi played for a total of 27 seasons in the Top Division of Soviet football. The main achievement of that period is the bronze medals of the USSR Championship won in 1966. Neftçi has won nine Azerbaijan Premier League titles, six Azerbaijan Cups and two Azerbaijan Supercup titles. The club is one of the two teams in Azerbaijan, along with Qarabağ, which has participated in all Azerbaijan Premier League championships so far.

In 2012, Neftçi became the first Azerbaijani club to advance to the group stage of a European competition after defeating APOEL 4–2 on aggregate in the play-off round of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. Neftçi plays its matches at the Neftçi Arena in Baku, which also serves as the venue for Azerbaijan national team matches.

== History ==

=== Soviet era (1937–1991) ===

The club was founded on 18 March 1937 and played under the name of Neftyanik until 1968. The first official match of Neftyanik took place on May 24, 1937. In the 1/64 finals of the Soviet Cup, Neftyanik beat FC Dinamo Yerevan (1:0). The goal scored by Pavel Shtyrlin in the 87th minute was the first in the history of Neftçi.

The team, which has played since the USSR championships in the group G, took the 11th place among 12 participants. In the same year, in the matches for the USSR Cup, Neftyanik, although he won in 1/64 and 1/32 finals in the Dinamo teams from Yerevan and Batumi, lost in the 1/16 finals from the fight, losing to the Dinamo Tbilisi.

Between 1938 and 1941, Neftyanik also played in local Azerbaijani and Caucasus championships. At the start of World War II, the players had to join the army. Mirmehdi Aghayev, who played for the club before the war, was among those killed in action. As the war drew to an end, the team gradually resumed operations and in 1944, Neftyanik returned to the Azerbaijani championship, becoming champions the following year.
Neftyanik competed in the 2nd Group of the USSR championship in 1946–1948, and was qualified for the first time in its history for the 1st Group (Top League) in 1949. After Temp Baku which took part only one year in the 1st Group eleven years ago, Neftyanik became the second representative of the Republic in that level in the history of Azerbaijan football. The first Top League match was against the VVS Moscow at the then Lenin Stadium (now Ismat Gayibov Stadium). In this historic match, the team won with a score of 1:0. The first goal in group A of the championship of the USSR was recorded by Viktor Anoshkin. They finished the Top Division in 14th place in their debut season. Playing in the Top Division for two consecutive years, Neftyanik left it in 1950 and had to play in the Class B again. The team was qualified for the second time in its history for the Top League in 1960, and by playing regularly in the Top League during 1960–1965.

The 1966 season stands out in the history of Neftçi, as the club achieved its biggest success in the USSR championships by finishing third. By beating Spartak Moscow 3:0 in the last game of the championship in the current Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium on 30 November, the Black and Whites, coached by 31-year-old Ahmad Alaskarov, reached 45 points and finished only two points short of the Rostov Army Club who were second. Dynamo Kyiv won the championship with 56 points. Two years later, in 1968, the club began the 30th USSR championship as Neftçi rather than Neftyanik.

Neftçi dropped to the Second Division in 1972 and spent the 1973–76 seasons there. Elbrus Abbasov played a great role in the team&#x27;s comeback. By scoring 28 goals, he became the Second Division&#x27;s top scorer, helping the Black and Whites finish second and qualify for the top flight again. In 1987 season, Neftçi coached by Aghasalim Mirjavadov, finished the championship in 9th place, registering its best performance since 1971. The team was known for its attacking trio which included Isgandar Javadov, Mashalla Ahmadov and Igor Ponomaryov. 1988 was a disappointing season for the club, as they finished 15th and were relegated to the Second Division. Aghasalim Mirjavadov coached them in the first half of the season and Yuriy Kuznetsov in the second, but neither could save the team from relegation.

=== Domestic hegemony (1991–2012) ===

Neftçi won the first Azerbaijani national championship having begun as clear favourites, since many of the players playing for the club at the end of the Soviet period remained. The team was coached by Ahmad Alaskarov. Another success came three years later. In 1995, Neftçi, led by Vagif Sadygov, defeated all rivals in the fight for the Cup of Azerbaijan. 1995–1996 season, Neftçi finished with a &quot;golden double&quot; — won the national championship and became the owner of the Cup. This success was achieved thanks to the efforts of coaches Vagif Sadygov, Asif Aliyev and Kazbek Tuaev.

In 2006, Neftçi managed to win the CIS Cup after defeating FBK Kaunas of Lithuania in the final. In European competitions, the club also have advanced to the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League twice, having defeated Bosnian champions – NK Široki Brijeg – and Icelandic champions – FH Hafnarfjarðar – in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Neftçi advanced to the third round of the 2008 Intertoto Cup, after defeating the Slovak club FC Nitra and the Belgian side K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot in the first two rounds.

A long period of decline followed the success of the 2005 to the end of the decade. Despite the appointment of famous names such as Gurban Gurbanov, Vlastimil Petržela, Anatoliy Demyanenko and Hans-Jürgen Gede, the club did not achieve any success and squandered large sums of money on unsuccessful signings.

Prospects changed positively in December 2009 when the club&#x27;s control was given to Sadıq Sadıqov. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile international players such as Bahodir Nasimov, Nicolás Canales, Flavinho, Bruno Bertucci, Eric Ramos, Igor Mitreski and Julius Wobay. In May 2011, coached by Arif Asadov, the club won its sixth championship title. Asadov also become the first person in Azerbaijan to win the league title as a coach and football player. However, Asadov was dismissed after the defeat to Dinamo Zagreb in the qualifying round of the Champions League 2011–2012 season.

In the 2011–12 season, Boyukagha Hajiyev guided Neftçi to another domestic success as the club become champions for seventh time in their history. In November 2011, Neftçi celebrated its 1,000th victory in official matches and its 1,000th goal in Azerbaijan League, scored by Araz Abdullayev.

=== European breakthrough (2012–present) ===

In 2012, Neftçi qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage, being the first Azerbaijani team to advance to this stage in a European competition. Neftçi managed to get three points in six matches, drawing with Partizan both times and holding Internazionale away at the San Siro.

A third consecutive Premier League title followed in 2012–13. Neftçi then won the Azerbaijan Cup on 28 May 2013 to secure the domestic double. Following Neftçi&#x27;s early exit from European cups, Boyukagha Hajiyev resigned from his post. Following defeat at 2013 Azerbaijan Supercup, Nazim Suleymanov was appointed as Neftçi&#x27;s new manager after Tarlan Ahmadov was sacked just three months in charge. On 8 January 2014, Suleymanov resigned as manager after a transfer fund dispute. In May 2014, despite finishing fourth, Neftçi managed to win Azerbaijan Cup. In August 2014, the club reached Europa League play-off round after defeating Chikhura Sachkhere on aggregate.

On 2 November 2014, Neftçi club president Sadygov stated that the club was experiencing financial difficulties. In 2015, it was announced that the club would become a public limited company – Neftchi PLC, while the club&#x27;s new president would be Chingiz Abdullayev.

On 8 June 2018, Roberto Bordin was announced as Neftçi&#x27;s new manager on a two-year contract. Under the head coach of Roberto Bordin, the team finished Azerbaijan Premier League in second place and they have advanced two qualifying rounds in the UEFA Europa League. On 18 January 2020, the club officially announced that the contract with Bordin mutually terminated, and he was replaced temporarily by his assistant Fizuli Mammadov.

On 11 November 2020, Samir Abasov was appointed manager. The contract between the parties was signed until the end of the 2021/2022 season. In the first season under his coach, the club won the Azerbaijan Premier league after 7 years again.

On 11 July 2023, Adrian Mutu was appointed as Neftçi&#x27;s new Head Coach on a two-year contract.

On June 26, 2024, Roman Hryhorchuk was appointed as club&#x27;s head coach. On October 7, 2024, his contract with the club was terminated by mutual agreement. Under his leadership, Neftçi played in 9 rounds of the Azerbaijani Premier League, recording 5 draws and 4 losses.

== Crest and colours ==

In 1937 Baku had already gained a reputation as an oil city. Therefore, those working in the field of &quot;black gold&quot; soon formed a football team on 18 March 1937. But they didn&#x27;t have to think much about the name. They gave own names to the team. The color of &quot;black gold&quot; also formed the basis of the form. At that time, along with oil, cotton, called &quot;white gold&quot;, played no less a role in the glory of the Azerbaijani SSR than oil, so it was decided that the color of cotton should be reflected in the form. Since then, Neftçi, has remained faithful to black-white.

1949 means for history of Neftçi not less than the year of its establishment. That year taking part under the name Neftyanik, the club was qualified for the first time in its history for the Soviet Top League. A radical changes were made in the staff of Neftyanik with the aim to provide successes of the team among Football elite. Also the team logotype was made. The emblem was the letter &quot;Н&quot; of the Cyrillic Alphabet against the background of an oil rig – the first letter of the word Neftyannik.

<text>The Theft Act 1968 (c. 60) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It creates a number of offences against property in England and Wales.

On 15 January 2007 the Fraud Act 2006 came into force, redefining most of the offences of deception.

==History==
The Theft Act 1968 resulted from the efforts of the Criminal Law Revision Committee to reform the English law of theft. The Larceny Act 1916 had codified the common law, including larceny itself, but it remained a complex web of offences. The intention of the Theft Act 1968 was to replace the existing law of larceny and other deception-related offences, by a single enactment, creating a more coherent body of principles that would allow the law to evolve to meet new situations.

==Provisions==
A number of greatly simplifiedor at least less complicatedoffences were created.

===Section 1 – Basic definition of &quot;theft&quot;===
This section creates the offence of theft. This definition is supplemented by sections 2 to 6. The definition of theft under the Theft Act 1968 is:
===Section 2 – &quot;Dishonestly&quot;===
This section provides a partial definition of dishonesty for certain purposes.

===Section 3 – &quot;Appropriation&quot;===
Appropriation is defined as &quot;Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner&quot;.

The courts have interpreted the assumption &quot;of the rights of an owner&quot; to mean that a person assumes at least one of a set of rights rather than having to assume &quot;all&quot; of the rights of the owners. This interpretation of the legislation was originally given in the case of &quot;R v Morris; Anderton v Burnside&quot; [1984] UKHL 1, and it has been endorsed by the decision in &quot;R v Gomez&quot; [1993] AC 442.

===Section 4 – &quot;Property&quot;===
The definition of property is:

===Section 5 – &quot;Belonging to another&quot;===
The definition of belonging to another is 

It is possible to have a proprietary right or interest over property that in the ordinary sense belongs to someone else. In the case of &quot;R v Turner (No. 2)&quot; [1971] 1 WLR 901, the Court of Appeal found that a man had committed theft by driving away his car without having paid for repairs made on the car. The garage that repaired his car had a proprietary right over it.

One can have a controlling interest in a piece of property even after selling it. In &quot;R v Marshall&quot; [1998] 2 Cr App R 282, a group of defendants resold used tickets for the London Underground. The Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal in part because the tickets said they were the property of London Underground, a condition of sale agreed to by the original buyer of the ticket.

Section 5 includes subsections that deal with possession that has conditions. Section 5(3) deals with situations where a person has given property to another for a particular purpose: the person receiving the property is said to be engaging in theft if they use the property for some purpose it was not intended. If A gives B money to purchase a particular good for A and B buys something else with it without A&#x27;s consent, even though the property is not in A&#x27;s hands, A still has a controlling interest in it under Section 5(3).

If one is placed under a duty to use property in a particular way, that obligation must be legal under civil law according to the Court of Appeal in &quot;R v Breaks and Huggan&quot; (1998).

There are limits to the legal obligations one is liable for under Section 5(3). In &quot;R v Hall&quot; (1972), a customer paid a deposit to a travel agent. The deposit was paid into the company&#x27;s bank account but the travel agent went out of business. This was not an instance of theft as the money was legitimately paid as a deposit against cancellation and there was no specific obligation to spend the money in a particular way.

Section 5(4) requires that if property is received by mistake it must be returned and failure to do so counts as appropriation. This was seen in action in &quot;Attorney-General&#x27;s Reference (No. 1 of 1983)&quot; where a police officer was given £74 extra in her wages but failed to return it or alert her superiors to it. The Court of Appeal held it to be theft.

===Section 6 – &quot;Intention to permanently deprive&quot;===
This section provides that a person in order to be guilty of theft had the intention of permanently depriving the other of the property. In certain cases, the intention to deprive may be construed, even when the person may not have meant to deprive another of their property permanently, for example if the intention is to treat another&#x27;s property as one&#x27;s own to dispose of regardless of the other&#x27;s rights.

===Section 7 – Theft===
This section provides that a person convicted of theft on indictment is liable to imprisonment to a term not exceeding seven years.

===Section 8 – Robbery===
Section 8(1) creates the offence of robbery (theft by force or threat of force). Section 8(2) provides that a person convicted on indictment of robbery or assault with intent to rob is liable to imprisonment for life. Common assault itself is defined at common law.

===Section 9 – Burglary===
This section codifies the offence of burglary and provides for penalties for that offence on conviction on indictment. The offence consists of entering a building (including an &quot;inhabited vehicle or vessel&quot;, such as a caravan or ship, and regardless of whether any inhabitant is there at the time) as a trespasser, either with intent to commit (section 9(1)(a)), or actually committing or attempting to commit (section 9(1)(b)), an offence of theft, grievous bodily harm, or criminal damage. &quot;Theft&quot; for this purpose includes taking a conveyance without consent contrary to section 12(1). The maximum sentence is ten years&#x27; imprisonment, or fourteen years if the building is a dwelling.

The entry may be by entry of the full body, entry of part of the body or entry by an instrument.

Originally, rape was one of the offences that could lead to a charge of burglary. This very narrow definition was replaced with the more general offence of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence by section 63 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Trespass is usually a civil matter in English law.

===Section 10 – Aggravated burglary===
Section 10(1) creates the offence of aggravated burglary, which involves the use of weapons or explosives. Section 10(2) provides that a person guilty of that offence is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

===Section 11 – Removal of articles from places open to the public===
This section creates the offence of removing an article from a place open to the public and provides that a person guilty of that offence is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

===Section 12 – Taking motor vehicle or other conveyance without authority===
Section 12(1) creates an offence of taking a conveyance without authority (referred to in police jargon as &quot;taking without consent&quot; or TWOC), which falls short of theft in that there is no intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession. &quot;Conveyance&quot; includes a land, water or air vehicle, but not an unmanned or remote-controlled vehicle, nor a pedal cycle. It is a summary offence with a maximum sentence of a level 5 fine on the standard scale or six months&#x27; imprisonment, or both.

Section 12(4) allows a jury to return a verdict of TWOC on an indictment for theft of a vehicle.

Section 12(5) creates a separate offence of taking a pedal cycle.

===Section 12A – Aggravated vehicle-taking===
This section, which was added by the Aggravated Vehicle-Taking Act 1992, creates an offence of aggravated vehicle taking, which involves either dangerous driving or causing injury or damage. It can only be committed in respect of a motor vehicle. It is an indictable offence carrying a maximum sentence of two years, or fourteen if it causes a person&#x27;s death.

===Section 13 – Abstracting of electricity===
This section creates the offence of abstracting electricity. It replaces section 10 of the Larceny Act 1916. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of five years.

===Section 14 – Thefts from mails outside England and Wales ===
This section provides that theft of or from mail bags being transported between jurisdictions in Britain (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), and robbery etc. during such a theft, can be prosecuted as though it was committed in England and Wales, even if the offence was committed elsewhere. This removes the burden on the prosecution to prove, for example, exactly where a train was when a theft took place on it.

===Section 15 – Obtaining property by deception===
This section created the offence of obtaining property by deception, a statutory version of the common law offence of cheating, and provided a definition of deception for the purpose of that offence and the offences under sections 15A, 16 and 20(2) of this Act and sections 1 and 2 of the Theft Act 1978. It was repealed and replaced by the more general offence of fraud under the Fraud Act 2006.

===Sections 15A and 15B – Obtaining a money transfer by deception===
Section 15A created the offence of obtaining a money transfer by deception. Section 15B made supplementary provision. They were repealed and replaced by the more general offence of fraud under the Fraud Act 2006.

===Section 16 – Obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception===
This section created the offence of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception. It was repealed and replaced by the more general offence of fraud under the Fraud Act 2006.

===Section 17 – False accounting===
This section creates an offence of false accounting. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of seven years.

===Section 18 – Liability of company officers for certain offences by company===
This section makes officers of corporations liable for offences under section 17 committed by the company where the offence was committed with the &quot;consent or connivance&quot; of that officer. Originally this also applied to offences under sections 15 and 16, but this was replaced by the offence of participating in a fraudulent business under section 9 of the Fraud Act 2006.

===Section 19 – False statements by company directors etc===
This section adds liability for any officer of a corporation or unincorporated association who publishes false accounts with intent to deceive members or creditors of the body corporate or association about its affairs. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of seven years.

===Section 20 – Suppression, etc, of documents===
Section 20(1) creates the offence of dishonestly destroying, defacing or concealing certain documents with intent to make a gain for oneself or loss for another. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of seven years.

Section 20(2) created the offence of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. This was replaced by fraud under the Fraud Act 2006.

===Section 21 – Blackmail===
This section creates the offence of blackmail. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of fourteen years.

===Section 22 – Handling stolen goods===
This section creates the offence of handling stolen goods. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of fourteen years.

===Section 23 – Advertising rewards for return of goods stolen or lost===
This section replaces section 102 of the Larceny Act 1861. The offence is made out only if an advertisement offers a reward for the return of the goods, &quot;and&quot; uses words to the effect that &quot;no questions will be asked&quot; or claims to ensure that the person &quot;will be safe from apprehension or inquiry&quot;. The printer or publisher is liable as well as the advertiser.

A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.

===Section 24 – Scope of offences relating to stolen goods===
This section defines &quot;stolen goods&quot; for the purpose of relevant offences. In particular, goods stolen outside England and Wales (by way of a criminal offence in the relevant jurisdiction), and goods obtained by blackmail or fraud (within the meaning of the Fraud Act 2006), though not the object of an offence of theft under this Act, nonetheless qualify as stolen.

===Section 24A – Dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit===
This section, added by the Theft (Amendment) Act 1996 and amended by the Fraud Act 2006, prohibits receiving a transfer of money to one&#x27;s account that one knows or believes derives from theft, blackmail, fraud, or stolen goods, and dishonestly not trying to cancel the transfer. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of ten years.

===Section 25 – Going equipped===

This section creates an offence of &quot;going equipped&quot; for burglary or theft. It is described by the marginal note to that section as &quot;going equipped for stealing, etc&quot;, and by the preceding crossheading as &quot;possession of housebreaking implements, etc&quot;. It includes any item that is designed to be used to carry out a theft or burglary, as well as any items made specifically by a thief for use in committing a burglary, etc. It is an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of three years.

The offence originally applied also to the offence under section 15 of this Act, as a statutory version of the common law offence of going equipped to cheat (obtain property by deception). This application was replaced by section 6 of the Fraud Act 2006.

<text>B68 Toftir is a Faroese football club based in the village of Toftir in Betri deildin.

==History==
After being promoted to the 1. deild (now called Effodeildin) in 1980, they won the league 3 times: in 1984, 1985, and 1992. In 2004 they were relegated. 2005 saw them bounce back to the top flight, coming first in the second division, but they were again relegated from the Premier Division at end of the 2006 season. In 2007, they easily won the second division, and were promoted.

In the 2008 season, they came 6th out of 10 in the Premier League. In the 2009 season, they finished in 4th place. In 2010, they finished as number 7 in the Effodeildin, and in 2011, they finished as number 6.

In 2012, B68 Toftir ended as number 9 in Effodeildin and were relegated: they only needed to score one more goal against TB Tvøroyri in the final round to stay up. They won the match 4–1, but it was not enough. They played in 1. deild in 2013.

<doc id="833866" wikidata="Q360485" url="?curid=833866" title="Scott Ian">
<text>Scott Ian (born Scott Ian Rosenfeld, December 31, 1963) is an American musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist, lyricist and co-founder of the thrash metal band Anthrax, of which he is the sole continuous member. Ian is also the guitarist, lyricist, and a founding member of the crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death, and is the rhythm guitarist for the metal bands the Damned Things and Mr. Bungle. He has hosted &quot;The Rock Show&quot; on VH1 and has appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the...&quot; series, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;SuperGroup&quot;.

==Early life==
Scott Ian Rosenfeld (his name has since been legally changed to drop his birth surname) was born to a Jewish family in the Bayside section of the New York City borough of Queens; he has a younger brother named Jason (who was the lead vocalist of Anthrax for a brief period in the early 1980s) and a half-brother named Sean. Ian attended Bayside High School, with classmates (and future Anthrax bandmates) Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.

Witnessing KISS live at Madison Square Garden in 1977 made a huge impact on Ian, who has been vocal about his love for the band (Ian appeared on an episode of &quot;Gene Simmons Family Jewels&quot;, in which he visited Simmons&#x27; home and spoke about the impact KISS has had on his life). Ian went on to be influenced by British heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Motörhead and Judas Priest, as well as the punk rock band Ramones. The musical style of his playing and songwriting including fast alternate picking was also largely influenced by the German metal band Accept.

Ian states that Malcolm Young, Rudolf Schenker, and Johnny Ramone were his biggest influences to pursue rhythm guitar.

== Career ==

===Anthrax===
As a founding member of Anthrax, Ian helped to create thrash metal in the mid-1980s alongside Megadeth, Slayer, and Metallica. He came up with the idea to collaborate with the rap group Public Enemy, covering their song &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; in 1991. This has been considered a foundational recording of the rap/rock genre. In 2005, Ian was invited by Chuck D of Public Enemy to perform &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; with them as part of their induction into VH1&#x27;s Hip Hop Honors Hall of Fame. He also joined Public Enemy on the &quot;Rock the Bells&quot; tour in 2007.

===Other ventures===
Ian began working with music television channel VH1 in 2001, when he was asked to host the program &quot;Rock Show&quot;. During his 48 episodes as host, he interviewed guests including Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford, Ted Nugent, Stone Temple Pilots, Megadeth, 3 Doors Down, Sevendust, Tenacious D, and the Cult. Ian was a regular commentator on various VH1 shows including the &quot;I Love the...&quot; series, &quot;100 Most Metal Moments&quot;, &quot;Awesomely Bad Number One Songs&quot;, &quot;When Metallica Ruled the World&quot;, and episodes of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; featuring Metallica, Pantera and Anthrax. Ian was prominently featured in VH1&#x27;s &quot;History of Heavy Metal&quot;. In June 2006, he starred in the VH1 reality series &quot;SuperGroup&quot; with Ted Nugent, Sebastian Bach, Jason Bonham and Evan Seinfeld.

Ian plays guitar in the group &quot;Pearl&quot; (with his wife, Pearl Aday), who toured with Velvet Revolver and Meat Loaf. Pearl&#x27;s debut album was released on January 19, 2010, through Megaforce Records. Ian performed with Pearl on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on January 20, 2010.

In 2008, DC Comics asked Ian to write a two-issue prestige-format comics series for the character Lobo. Books one and two of &quot;Lobo: Highway to Hell&quot; were released in November and December 2009.

In 2008, Ian signed with UltimateBet, the third largest internet gaming site in the world, as one of their online professional players. He joined professional poker players Phil Hellmuth and Annie Duke as one of Ultimate Bet&#x27;s star pros. He won Ultimate Bet&#x27;s premier Sunday 200K tournament and cashed in in 2010&#x27;s WSOP main event by finishing 634th out of 6494 players.

In 2010, Ian joined the metal supergroup the Damned Things, which released their first album on December 14, 2010. On June 21, 2011, his wife gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, thus forcing Ian to briefly depart from Anthrax&#x27;s tour. Andreas Kisser of Sepultura filled in for Scott on guitar during Scott&#x27;s absence.

Ian provided voice work for the Adult Swim show &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, as the character &quot;Some Guy Who Snuck Into Dethklok&#x27;s Trunk Last Night When They Were Pretty Hammered&quot; in the &quot;Season III: The Dead Man&quot; opening episode &quot;Renovationklok&quot;, as well as providing guest voices in the episode &quot;Tributeklok&quot;.

Ian did a spoken word tour entitled &quot;Speaking Words&quot;, starting in May 2013, in the UK.

In 2014, he and his wife joined former members of Mother Superior to form Motor Sister. They released their debut album, &quot;Ride&quot;, on March 9, 2015.

He also toured Europe and North American with a solo spoken word storytelling act called &quot;Speaking Words&quot; that year.

In 2015, Da Capo Press published Ian&#x27;s memoir titled &quot;I&#x27;m the Man: The Story of That Guy from Anthrax&quot;.

On December 12, 2017, Ian released his book &quot;Access All Areas: Stories from a Hard Rock Life&quot;, which is a follow-up to his first autobiographical book &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;, published November 24, 2015. The book features stories about his life including not only his adventures with Anthrax, but also with other musical celebrities such as Madonna and David Lee Roth.

In 2018, he toured Australia on another spoken word act called &quot;&#x27;Spoken Word Stories by Scottie&#x27;&quot; also known as &quot;One Man Riot&quot;.

In 2019, he contributed the foreword to the book &quot;King&#x27;s X: The Oral History&quot; by Greg Prato, published by Jawbone Press.

==Appearances in films==
Ian has appeared as himself, representing the character Kevin&#x27;s conscience, in the 2022 American teen comedy-drama &quot;Metal Lords&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ian was formerly married to his high school girlfriend, Marge Ginsburg, in the 1980s; the marriage ended in divorce.

In 2011, he married singer Pearl Aday, adopted daughter of singer Meat Loaf. They have one child.

Ian is a New York Yankees fan and enjoys snowboarding. He plays poker and is an online pro at UltimateBet; he finished 637th in the 2009 World Series of Poker Main Event, taking home $21,365. He is also a &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; fan and has posted numerous blogs about the show, even making an appearance for the red carpet series finale; he also played guitar on the soundtrack of &quot;The Plan&quot;, a made-for-DVD &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; film. He is a fan of the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as seen in &quot;The Best of the Doctor&quot;, which aired August 13, 2011, on BBC America (numbered episode 166). Ian is a fan of hip hop and rap music, particularly Public Enemy and Run-DMC. He was known to wear Public Enemy shirts while performing gigs in the late 1980s. He has also said Run-DMC came out with the same aggression that metal bands played with (that he was listening to at the time), and that Run-DMC was the group that put rap on the map.

He co-owned a hard rock bar called Dead Man&#x27;s Hand in Las Vegas with Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains.

Ian is an avid fan of Stephen King and has collected first and limited editions of his books. A number of Anthrax&#x27;s songs were inspired by King&#x27;s stories such as &quot;Among the Living&quot; (based on &quot;The Stand&quot;), &quot;A Skeleton In The Closet&quot; (&quot;Apt Pupil&quot;), &quot;Lone Justice&quot; and &quot;Breathing Lightning&quot; (&quot;the Dark Tower&quot; series).

==Equipment==
Scott Ian uses his signature Jackson guitars and signature Randall MTS Series heads and cabinets. He is known to use Dimebag Darrell tribute Deans and previously endorsed Washburn. During the mid-1980s, he used ESP guitars for a while, also getting Kirk Hammett his ESP endorsement. Scott uses a DigiTech signature Black 13 distortion pedal, and a DigiTech chorus pedal for his clean sounds. Many of his guitars have been equipped with custom made Seymour Duncan &quot;El Diablo&quot; pickups, but can also be seen using standard Seymour Duncan SH-4&#x27;s and &#x27;59 pickups on several guitars, including his newest signature Jackson. He also recently began endorsing Evertune bridges.

In late 2009, Ian ended his endorsement with Washburn and went back to Jackson guitars. He was seen using custom made Soloist and Randy Rhoads guitars during the 2009 Sonisphere Festival. On March 27, 2010, Ian announced the production of a new signature guitar by Jackson via Twitter and YouTube. He said it would be based on his Soloist from 1987. It has a silverburst finish, a single Seymour Duncan J.B. humbucker, lightning bolt inlays, and a string-thru/tune-o-matic bridge. A dual-humbucker version with a Floyd Rose tremolo will also be released. He stated, &quot;I am so stoked to be back with Jackson.&quot; He was seen using this guitar while playing with Brian Posehn at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards and with the Damned Things at the 2011 Download Festival.

<text>FK Ventspils was a Latvian professional football club based at Ventspils Olimpiskais Stadions in Ventspils. It was one of the most prominent football clubs in the country. The club played in the Latvian Virslīga since 1997. 

It folded in July 2021 and was officially liquidated on 19 January 2024. A new phoenix club - JFK Ventspils was created on the basis of the former FK Ventspils youth academy, returned to Latvian football and competes in the Latvian First League as of 2023.

In total, FK Ventspils has won six league titles and seven Latvian Cups. They became Latvian Higher League champions in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2014. In 2009 FK Ventspils became the first Latvian club to participate in the group stages of a UEFA competition after beating BATE Borisov from Belarus.

==History==

FK Ventspils was founded in 1997 with the merger of two former Ventspils clubs – FK Venta and FK Nafta. Its predecessor, Venta, was one of the leading clubs in the Latvian league in the 1960s.

===FK Venta===

The next notable success for “Venta” was in 1967, when they won the Latvian Cup. By that time they had quite a fighting fit line-up, and 1969 already was their golden year when Venta became champions. During the tournament they gained 43 points; 20 matches won, 3 matches ended with a draw and only 3 matches lost. Additionally, they lost only in the away matches. They scored 45 goals and 16 conceded. At that time Venta&#x27;s leader was a player manager, who is well known not only to the admirers of Ventspils, but the whole of Latvian football, Vladimir Chikinov.

This was the golden line-up: &quot;Leonid Virko, Konstantin Zhurkevich, Aleksandr Busarov, Valery Yashenko, Aleksandr Tronev, Ariy Shmerling, Vladimir Samohvalov, Aleksandr Novash, Nikolay Chaevky, Nikolay Pozdnyakov, Vladimir Chikinov, Viktor Yurinov, Viktor Litvinenko, Aleksandr Rakicky, Valentin Ipolitov, Vladimir Kutuzov, Valentin Vetrenko, Genady Hrustalov&quot;.

Of course, the victories did not come easy. There was a huge effort put into both – the matches and training. However, at that time they had quite a modest material and technical basis. They trained in the sport hall of Ventspils port, had training camps in Piltene and went to Moldova several times. They had close contacts with a children&#x27;s sport school from which talented youth players often came into the team. Whereas these days there are limits on foreign born players, at that time it was an obligation for the team to have two players younger than 18 years of age in the line-up. Thus, V. Kutuzov, V. Ivankovich, N. Dishlov and later Y. Romanenko, V. Fedotov and others appeared in the team.

In 1963 Ventspils gained a place and the rights to play in the Latvian championship (Virsliga). The next major achievement for &quot;Venta&quot; came in 1967, when it won the Latvian Cup. In 1969 &quot;Venta&quot; were champions of Latvia, in that season &quot;Venta&quot; got 43 points, 20 matches won, three drawn and three lost. In the 1970s the team lost its position, in the 1980s it lost its financial support and became defunct for some years. In 1994 Venta returned to 1. līga but after that season many players left the club as FK Nafta was formed. Until the merger Venta played in 1. liga.

===FK Nafta===

FK Nafta was formed in 1995, in the first season the club won its 2nd league division and earned a promotion to the 1st league. In its only season there the club finished higher than FK Venta. After the season the teams merged to form FK Ventspils.

===FK Ventspils===

The recent history of “Ventspils” began in 1997, the year of the team&#x27;s foundation. In February 2007, the club that represents the town on the bank of the river Venta with a population of 45 thousand people, celebrated its 10th anniversary. In a relatively short period of time FK “Ventspils” has become one of the strongest clubs in Latvia. FK “Ventspils” has rapidly developed and gained a reputation of a serious Latvian club, winning various trophies.

In 2003 FK &quot;Ventspils” won the Latvian Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, and in the next two consecutive years. Only the main trophy – golden medal of the Latvian championship – had yet to be attined. The team won silver and bronze medals of the Latvian championship several times, and, finally, in 2006 FK &quot;Ventspils&quot; became the champions of Latvia.

The Ukrainian specialist Roman Hryhorchuk led FK Ventspils to the main trophy. Prior to that, in 2003, FK Ventspils had won the Latvian Cup for the first time. Also, in 2004 and in 2005, FK Ventspils won the trophy, but only finished second and third in the Latvian championship. Before Hryhorchuk the team was managed by Russian coach Boris Sinicin, English coach Paul Anthony Ashworth, Lithuanian specialist Saulius Širmelis and the Latvian local Sergejs Semjonovs.

Despite being a relatively new club, FK Ventspils has also had a quite rich and interesting history in the Eurocups. In 1999 FK Ventspils had its debut in the Intertoto Cup and beat Norwegian team Vålerenga on aggregate. Later the club took part in the UEFA Cup, thus allowing fans to see matches against such famous European clubs as Stuttgart, Rosenborg, Brøndby and Newcastle United. The 0–0 draw in the away match against Newcastle United might have been called the greatest achievement of FK Ventspils until 2009. However, even more memorable were the matches against Brøndby in 2004, when FK Ventspils eliminated the Danish club from the UEFA Cup.

On 17 July 2007 FK Ventspils made its debut in the UEFA Champions League. The yellow-and-blue started their historical trip of the most prestigious club tournament in Europe in Wales, where they played against TNS. The author of the first FK Ventspils goal in the Champions League was forward Vits Rimkus. One week later, on 25 July, FK Ventspils achieved their first victory in the Champions league, beating TNS 2–1 at home. Goals were scored by defenders Jean-Paul Ndeki and Deniss Kačanovs. In the second qualifying round the Roman Hryhorchuk&#x27;s team played against Red Bull Salzburg, led by the legendary Italian specialist Giovanni Trapattoni and lost. In 2008 FK Ventspils participated in the Champions league for the second time. The first opponents of the team were again the champions of Wales, Llanelli.

===UEFA Europa league Group stage 2009/10===
In the 2009–10 season FK Ventspils became the first Latvian club to participate in the group stages of UEFA club competitions after beating BATE Borisov from Belarus in the last UEFA Europa League qualification round. FK Ventspils opponents in the group stages were Sporting CP from Portugal, Hertha BSC from Germany and Heerenveen from the Netherlands. Adding several experienced players to the squad, FK Ventspils showed a remarkable performance, playing 1–1 draws away in the Olympiastadion in Berlin and Estádio José Alvalade in Lisbon. They also kept a 0–0 draw against Heerenveen at home. With three points in six matches, FK Ventspils finished last in Group D, failing to qualify for the UEFA Europa League group stages.

In 2010 FK Ventspils won the 2009–10 Baltic League. They finished second in the national championship, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League first qualification stage. The club was knocked out of the tournament in the third qualification stage by Red Star Belgrade. In 2011, they won the national championship, securing their fourth league title. In 2013 FK Ventspils won the league for the fifth time and lifted the Latvian Cup for the sixth time in the club&#x27;s history. In the middle of 2013 the club participated in the UEFA Europa League qualification stages, reaching the third qualification stage. They knocked out the Welsh champions Airbus UK Broughton and Luxembourg National Division club Jeunesse Esch, but lost to the Israeli club Maccabi Haifa.

===Disqualification===

On 9 June 2021, UEFA banned FK Ventspils from participating in UEFA club competitions for the next seven years (i.e. up to and including the 2027–28 season) for violating UEFA regulations related to &quot;fraud, bribery and/or corruption&quot; and for &quot;violation of the integrity of matches and competitions&quot;. Club officials Nikolajs Djakins and Adlan Shishkanov were banned from football for 4 years and for life, respectively. The charges were related to July 2018 Europa League qualifier against Bordeaux, Russian referee Sergey Lapochkin who was refereeing that game was banned from football activity for 10 years.

=== Dissolution ===
By 2021, financial problems had beset the club and in the middle of the 2021 Virslīga season the club pulled out of the league and was dissolved.

<text>Kauno futbolo ir beisbolo klubas, commonly known as FBK Kaunas, was a Lithuanian football club from the city of Kaunas.

==History==

===Banga Kaunas (1960–1993)===
Originally the team was founded in 1960 as Banga Kaunas and played its first three years in the Soviet First League. Afterwards the club decided to play in the Lithuanian SSR Championship and they did so until 1990. In that period they won two Lithuanian SSR Championship&#x27;s. One in 1986 and another in 1989. When Lithuania regained independence in 1991 A Lyga was created and they played as Banga Kaunas until 1993 before the club changed its name.

===FBK Kaunas (1993–1999 and 2000–2012)===
The club changed its name in 1993 to Kauno futbolo beisbolo klubas. The club had in its first years not such a great success and FBK Kaunas had to wait until 1999 before they could lift a trophy again. Club was shortly renamed to Žalgiris Kaunas after the 9th round of 1999 A Lyga, but only carried the name for the remaining of the season. From 1999 to 2008, Kaunas won 8 championships, 4 Lithuanian cups, 3 super cups and 1 Baltic league title, but in the autumn of 2008 Kaunas dominance was once and for all broken when FK Ekranas won the championship in front of FBK Kaunas. After finishing second in 2008 A Lyga championship the club&#x27;s president announced that the club were being demoted from the A Lyga in favour of LFF I Lyga, the 2nd tier of Lithuanian football system, but as conflict with LFF intensified, FBK Kaunas was relegated to LFF II lyga (consisting of amateur teams).

FBK Kaunas won II lyga championship in their first year in that division. Despite relegation FBK Kaunas also participated in the new UEFA Europe League as a vice-champ of Lithuania but did not advance past FK Sevojno. Despite drawing both games FBK Kaunas lost on away goals. FBK Kaunas won I Lyga in 2010 and was promoted to the 2011 A Lyga season. The 2011 season was a huge disappointment for Kaunas as they didn&#x27;t manage to live up to the high expectations and eventually ended at a 10th place.

FBK Kaunas were not granted a 2012 A Lyga license because of financial problems and was due to play in the 2012 I Lyga. However, due to the clubs increasing financial problems the chairman eventually decided to withdraw the club from any competitions and later declared the club bankrupt. Shortly afterwards the fans decided to form a new club.

Kaunas have played Celtic, Rangers and Liverpool among others in Europa League and Champions League qualifying stages. On 5 August 2008, FBK Kaunas defeated Rangers, 2–1, to advance to the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League for the first time. The game was won in dramatic circumstances as Kaunas had to come from behind and finally took the lead just four minutes from time. Linas Pilibaitis was the scorer.

FBK Kaunas were for many years (1993–2012) sponsored by Ūkio bankas, a bank which had Vladimir Romanov as its principal shareholder. In October 2005 Romanov became the majority shareholder of Scottish Premier League side, Heart of Midlothian. Romanov then used Kaunas as a feeder club for Hearts by signing players ostensibly for Kaunas, then immediately loaning them to the SPL side. Romanov&#x27;s mismanagement and dubious dealings effectively destroyed the clubs he was involved with FBK Kaunas and Partizan Minsk going bankrupt and Hearts into administration. BC Zalgiris also suffer from his dishonesty to this day. Romanov fled to Russia where he was granted asylum in 2014 and is now wanted by the Lithuanian prosecutors on charges for fraud and embezzling for at least £308m.

<text>Sliema Wanderers Football Club, nicknamed &quot;tax-Xelin&quot; (of the shilling), is a professional Maltese football club. It is the most successful team in Malta and hails from the seaside town of Sliema. It currently plays in the Maltese Premier League.

==History==
The club was founded in 1909. The club competed in the first ever Maltese Premier League season in 1909–10 and finished in second position to Floriana after the five-game season came to an end.

Ten years down the line Sliema Wanderers finally made their mark in Maltese football by winning the Maltese Premier League title in the 1919–20 season. Since then the team have gone on to win the title 26 times, a record for Malta; the last three being in 2002–03, 2003–04 and 2004–05.

Sliema Wanderers also hold the record for the most FA Trophy wins, with their first coming in 1935, when they overpowered Floriana with a 4–0 victory. The club have gone on to win this particular honour 20 times, most recently in 2000, 2004 and in 2009; the last title was won against Valletta 7–6 on penalties after the match finished 3–3 following extra time.

With all these honours, Sliema Wanderers are currently the most successful team in the history of Maltese football with approximately 113 honours. Sliema Wanderers train at the Tigne Sports Complex, in Sliema.

Sliema Wanderers also had a futsal team, which participated in Malta&#x27;s top futsal league.

===2000s===
The 2000s saw Sliema Wanderers becoming a dominant club in the Maltese scene again.

Summer 2003 had President Robert Arrigo signing Maltese internationals Jamie Pace, Djibril Sylla and Daniel Bogdanovic.

Season 2004-05 saw the Wanderers, under the presidency of Robert Arrigo, win their 26th Maltese Premier League title. Part of this success was Michael Mifsud&#x27;s return to his boyhood club after being leaving 1.FC Kaiserslautern on a free.

Season 2005-06 started with a UEFA Champions League qualifier against Sheriff Tiraspol. Much to Arrigo&#x27;s chagrin, lost Michael Mifsud to Lillestrøm SK, in a move made possible by Nikki Dimech who acted as his representative, albeit being a lengthy transfer saga that was complicated by International Transfer Clearance issues and compensation fees.

===2010s===
Sliema Wanderers clinched a Maltese FA Trophy in season 2015-16.

Keith Perry was confirmed as president in the beginning of season 2016-17 despite rumours. John Buttigieg was appointed as Head Coach.

===2020s===
The club endured a rough start to the 2020s. The club started off with a bang, signing former Arsenal F.C. midfielder Denílson. Further players were signed and Keith Perry was appointed chairman of the club, and Jeffrey Farrugia took over as president. A sponsorship deal was struck with Catco Group, an oil investment company based in China and Tunisia. Catco Group however, failed to pay its dues, citing technical reasons. This gave way to unrest within the club, with captain Mark Scerri and head coach Andrea Pisanu making public statements regarding the financial situation of the club, proceeding with resignations such as Perry and team manager Alex Muscat. Players went unpaid for months, with another sponsor, Sixt, finally paying the players directly just before Christmas. Eventually a new sponsor was brought on board. Farrugia was later ousted as Keith Perry returned in the President&#x27;s seat in preparation for the upcoming season.

Season 2021-22 was disastrous from a technical point of view. Despite signing two new players in Djibouti international Warsama Hassan and Japanese Yuki Uchida, up until 19 November 2021, the club had not yet won a match, and sat at the bottom of the Maltese Premier League. The first win came on 20 November, stunning Valletta with a 2–1 result. The dying minutes of the match however, proved fatal, as Warsama Hassan was introduced at 90 minutes. However, the player had just returned from Egypt, where he had featured for his Djibouti national football team in a match against Algeria. Warsama was supposed to be in quarantine, having returned from a Dark Red listed country. Valletta lodged a formal complaint, which was upheld by the Malta Football Association, awarding a 3–0 win to Valletta. Sliema Wanderers&#x27; next match was against Birkirkara F.C., resulting in a further loss. On 10 April 2022 Sliema Wanderers lost against Valletta with a 2–1 result, and were relegated to Maltese Challenge League after thirty-seven years in the top flight.

<text>FC Tiraspol was a Moldovan football club based in Tiraspol, Moldova. They played in the Divizia Naţională, the top division in Moldovan football.

Founded in 1992 as &quot;Constructorul Chișinău&quot;, it entered the Moldovan National Division in the 1995–96 season, winning its only title in the 1996–97 and Moldovan Cups in 1996 and 2000. The club then relocated in 2001 to Cioburciu before moving to Tiraspol the year after. Despite the latter two settlements being in the breakaway republic of Transnistria, their clubs play in the Moldovan league system.

==History==

===Constructorul Chișinău===
The side was founded in 1992 as &quot;Constructorul Chișinău&quot;, and played in Chișinău, the Moldovan capital. It entered the Moldovan National Division in the 1995–96 season. Constructorul won their first silverware, the 1996 Moldovan Cup with a 2–1 win over Tiligul Tiraspol, and the next season won their only Moldovan National Division title by denying city rivals Zimbru Chișinău a sixth consecutive triumph. The league triumph earned Constructorul a place in the 1997-98 UEFA Champions League, where they were knocked out by Belarusian club MPKC Mozyr 4–3 on aggregate in the first qualifying round. In 2000, Constructorul won their second Cup, by beating Zimbru 1–0 in the final on 24 May.

The club also participated in the UEFA Cup during the Constructorul era. In September 2000, the club was banned from appearing in European competitions for a year following a number of security breaches in a home match against Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia.

The first FC Tiraspol chairman was Valeriu Rotari (1947–2000), a businessman accused of organized crime gang activities. Thanks to Rotari, the club managed to achieve his first National Division titles. The murder of Rotari on February 16, 2000, was one of the reasons the club&#x27;s further performance was much worse than in the 1990s.

===Move to Transnistria===
Before the 2001–02 season, the club relocated to Cioburciu, a small village outside Tiraspol, the capital of the breakaway republic of Transnistria, and was renamed &quot;Constructorul Cioburciu&quot;. The following season, the club moved into Tiraspol and became its current entity. The club has not won a Cup or National Division title since leaving Chișinău.

The only major European campaign since leaving Chișinău was the 2004-05 UEFA Cup. The club defeated Armenian team Shirak in the first qualifying round (4–1 on aggregate) before a 5–1 aggregate elimination by Metalurh Donetsk of Ukraine in the next round.

<text>Sir James Alexander Mirrlees (5 July 1936 – 29 August 2018) was a British economist and winner of the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He was knighted in the 1997 Birthday Honours.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, Mirrlees was educated at Douglas Ewart High School, then at the University of Edinburgh (MA in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in 1957) and Trinity College, Cambridge (Mathematical Tripos and PhD in 1963 with thesis title &quot;Optimum Planning for a Dynamic Economy&quot;, supervised by Richard Stone). He was a very active student debater. A contemporary, Quentin Skinner, has suggested that Mirrlees was a member of the Cambridge Apostles along with fellow Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen during the period.

== Economics ==
Between 1968 and 1976, Mirrlees was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three times. He was also a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1986) and Yale University (1989). He taught at both Oxford University (as Edgeworth Professor of Economics 1968–1995) and University of Cambridge (1963–1968 and 1995–2018).

During his time at Oxford, he published papers on economic models for which he would eventually be awarded his Nobel Prize. The papers centred on asymmetric information, which determines the extent to which they should affect the optimal rate of saving in an economy. Among other results, he demonstrated the principles of &quot;moral hazard&quot; and &quot;optimal income taxation&quot; discussed in the books of William Vickrey. The methodology has since become the standard in the field.

Mirrlees and Vickrey shared the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences &quot;for their fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information&quot;.

Mirrlees was also co-creator, with MIT Professor Peter A. Diamond, of the Diamond–Mirrlees efficiency theorem, which was developed in 1971.

Mirrlees was emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He spent several months a year at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He was the Distinguished Professor-at-Large of the Chinese University of Hong Kong as well as University of Macau.

In 2009, he was appointed Founding Master of the Morningside College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Mirrlees was a member of Scotland&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers. He also led the Mirrlees Review, a review of the UK tax system by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

His PhD students included eminent academics and policymakers like professor Franklin Allen, Sir Partha Dasgupta, professor Huw Dixon, professor Hyun-Song Shin, Lord Nicholas Stern, professor Anthony Venables, Sir John Vickers, and professor Zhang Weiying. He died in Cambridge, England, on 29 August 2018.

== Personal life ==
Mirrlees was an atheist.

<text>FK Pobeda () was a football club based in the city of Prilep, North Macedonia.

==History==
The club was founded in 1941 as Goce Delčev and renamed in 1950 to FK Pobeda. FK Pobeda has been a winner of Macedonian First League for two times (eight times as Republic League in Yugoslavia), and Macedonian Football Cup for one time (eight times as Republic Cup in Yugoslavia). Their first great period was the 1950s, when they won the Republic Cup for the first time in 1951. One year later Pobeda won its first championship title in 1952 and in 1954 the second one. They waited for 4 years for their next trophy they won the Republic Cup for the second time in 1958. Next year 1959 they became champions of SR Macedonia again. They continued with their winning series in the 1960s. Pobeda won its 3rd cup in 1960, and again the cup masters won their 4th cup in 1961. Next year it was time for a new championship title in 1962, and then the duble crown in 1963. Last trophy in the 1960s was 1964 Republic Cup for the 6th time. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Pobeda had a stagnation period although it was on the top most of the time and they played pretty good in the cup too. Finally after 13 years Pobeda won again, and again it was the Macedonian Republic Cup in 1977 for the 7th time. Two years after Pobeda was back on track winning its 5th title after 16 years waiting. Two years after in 1981 Pobeda did it again 7th time champion of SR Macedonia. The 1980s was their last good period and they won their 8th championship title in 1986. Next year it was time to win the cup again and they did it for the 8th time in 1987 (and last time in the part of Yugoslavia).

The period of the 1990s, after an independence of Macedonia, didn&#x27;t bring much excitement for the Pobeda&#x27;s fans and they had to wait for better times. The beginning of the 2000s was a good sign and the long period of waiting was over. In 2002 it was time to win the Macedonian Football Cup for the first and only time. Two years later the club was won the champions title in 2004 for the first time since of the Macedonia&#x27;s independence. They didn&#x27;t wait for long to win their second, 3 years later in 2007 Pobeda was champion again and for the last time. Also, Pobeda has represented Macedonia for ten times in the European Football Cups. On March 27, 2009, UEFA, the governing body of football in Europe, charged FK Pobeda over match fixing allegations relating to a Champions League qualifying match against FC Pyunik of Armenia in 2004 They were subsequently found guilty and banned from UEFA competitions for eight years. The next season in which they will be eligible to compete is 2017–18. In April 2017, their suspension was expired and Pobeda will be returning to the Macedonian leagues soon.

A successor club which claims rights to Pobeda&#x27;s honours and records was established in 2010 under the name Viktorija, later renamed to Pobeda Junior and then to the name of the original club. However, they are not legally considered to be successors to the original Pobeda and the two clubs&#x27; track records and honours are kept separate by the Football Federation of Macedonia.

==Rivalries==
The club&#x27;s biggest rivals are Pelister, and matches between the teams are called the &quot;Derby of Pelagonia&quot; (geographical region in Macedonia).

==Supporters==
FK Pobeda supporters were called &quot;Majmuni&quot; (Monkeys).

<text>Football Club Pyunik (), commonly known as Pyunik (), is an Armenian professional sports club based in the Kentron neighbourhood of Yerevan. Pyunik is mostly known for its professional football team which, since its creation in 1992, has always played in the Armenian Premier League, becoming the most successful team of Armenia in number of official titles, with 34 won to date.

Internationally, Pyunik has yet to win an international title, with the closest result being a bronze place finish in the 2006 Commonwealth of Independent States Cup. Pyunik&#x27;s domestic success usually qualifies the team for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds. Pyunik is also known to be one of the most popular football clubs in Armenia, along with Urartu, Shirak and Ararat.

Pyunik has always had a fierce rivalry with Ararat, as both clubs are considered to be the most successful clubs in Armenia, the latter due to its Soviet accomplishments. Both clubs are also the two most popular in the country and favorites within the Armenian Diaspora. Pyunik also shares a rivalry with Urartu which began when Urartu relocated from Abovyan to Yerevan in 2001, and became the third largest team in the city. The Pyunik-Urartu rivalry is seen as one of the biggest clashes in Armenian football.

Pyunik&#x27;s home stadium is the Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium, which is also home to the Armenia national football team. The youth academy has produced many Armenian internationals such as Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Robert Arzumanyan, Karlen Mkrtchyan, Edgar Manucharyan, Varazdat Haroyan and Gevorg Ghazaryan, many who have played or are playing for top European clubs.

==History==
Pyunik was founded in 1992 by Armenian football legend Khoren Oganesian and originally named Homenetmen Yerevan. The club won the first Armenian Premier League competition held in 1992 which it shared with Shirak since both teams were tied on points. In 1995, Homenetmen Yerevan was renamed FC Pyunik (Armenian for &quot;Phoenix&quot;). Following the change of name, Pyunik went on to win the 1995–96 Armenian Premier League and end the season with a 59-match unbeaten streak.

In 1996, Pyunik played its first international cup match, a UEFA Europa League qualifying match against Finnish club HJK Helsinki which Pyunik won 3–1. Pyunik also won the 1996-97 Armenian Premier League securing itself another chance at qualifying for an international cup playoffs the following year.

In 1997, Pyunik played its first UEFA Champions League qualifying match against Hungarian side MTK Budapest FC yet failed to qualify for the playoffs following a 6–3 defeat on aggregate.

1998 proved to be a crucial year for the club following the loss of its main source of funding and the subsequent departure of its main players. Pyunik finished 6th that season and withdrew from football altogether.

Pyunik secured a comeback to professional football following its absorption of FC Armenicum, a newly promoted team to the Armenian Premier League. The club&#x27;s new management sought to bring more experience to the club and reinforced the squad with foreign players from Argentina, Cameroon, Mali and Romania. The reinforcements brought positive results and Pyunik went on to win the 2001 Armenian Premier League and 2002 Armenian Cup.

2002 saw Pyunik advance to the second round of the UEFA Champions League qualifying round after beating Finnish champions Tampere United 6–0 on aggregate. From 2002 forwards, Pyunik went on to win the Armenian Premier League a record of 10 times in a row, from 2001 to 2010.

On 8 January 2020, former Armenian international goalkeeper Roman Berezovsky was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager. Just over 7-months later, 13 July 2020, Berezovsky left the club by mutual consent. On 20 July 2020, Artak Oseyan was announced as Pyunik&#x27;s new manager, but left his role as head coach on 13 December 2020. On 7 January 2021, Yegishe Melikyan was announced as Pyunik&#x27;s new manager.

In the 2022/23 season, after victories over Cluj and Dudelange, Pyunik became the first ever Armenian club to reach the third round of Champions League qualifying, where they played against former European Champions Crvena Zvezda, losing 7–0 on aggregate.

Subsequently, Pyunik dropped into the play-off round of the Europa League, where they played against the Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol. After two scoreless draws, Pyunik lost on penalties, thus dropping into the group stages of the Conference League, the first ever group stage appearance in a European competition for the club.

After a defeat away against Basel on the first matchday, Pyunik faced Slovan Bratislava in their first home match in Yerevan, which they won thanks to goals from Artak Dashyan and Yusuf Otubanjo. This result meant that they became the first ever Armenian team to win a game in UEFA group stage competitions.

On 31 December 2024, Pyunik released a statement stating that ownership of the club had passed from Artur Soghomonyan to Anton Farber.

===Domestic history===
*Due to the 1995 season being a transitional season, there was no official winner of championship.
*Championship was decided by a decision game.

=== European history ===


==Kit and badge==
Throughout the seasons, Pyunik has predominantly worn blue and white jerseys, with a few exceptions including Pyunik&#x27;s first jerseys which were orange and

Puma is the club&#x27;s current kit supplier since 2019.

On 3 August 2020, Pyunik announced that Joma would be supplying the team&#x27;s kit for the 2020–21 season.

===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===
===Badge===
The club has had five different designs for its badge during its history, with the first three designs being significantly different from each other. 
Following the club&#x27;s reappearance in 2001, Pyunik introduced its iconic logo design which included a bold letter P placed on top of a football. The club kept this design for 13 years before introducing a double-headed golden phoenix crest in 2014. This change resulted unpopular among the fans and Pyunik introduced a new badge in 2019, this time returning to its original round shape with a predominantly blue logo and a red phoenix in the center.

==Stadium==

Pyunik used several locations throughout its history. Between 1992 and 1998, Pyunik played at Hrazdan Stadium, Armenia&#x27;s largest stadium with a capacity for 54,208 spectators.

In 2001, following the renovations works done at the Republican Stadium two years before, Pyunik relocated and played all its home matches there until 2013, with a brief interruption in 2008, when the club was forced to play at Pyunik Stadium; its training ground, due to renovation works at the Republican Stadium.

Between 2013 and 2017, the Yerevan Football Academy served as a home venue for all domestic competitions, while still using the Republican Stadium for international fixtures.
At the beginning of 2017–18 Armenian Premier League season, Pyunik used the Republican Stadium as a home venue during the first half of the season, and eventually returning to their own Pyunik Stadium during the second half.

The Republican Stadium is also the home of the Armenia national football team, and is sometimes used by other Armenian teams for their international cup fixtures.

The club is currently planning on building an all-seater 5,000 capacity stadium by 2022.

===List of stadiums used by the club===
* Hrazdan Stadium: 1992–98
* Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium: 2001–08 
* Pyunik Stadium: 2008
* Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium: 2008–13
* Yerevan Football Academy Stadium: 2013–17
* Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium/Pyunik Stadium: 2017–18
* Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium: 2018–present

==Supporters==

Pyunik&#x27;s supporter base is traditionally regarded as part of Yerevan&#x27;s higher class, in contrast with the supposedly more lower-class base of cross-town arch rival FC Urartu. Because of the club&#x27;s history and recent success, the fanbase has grown not only in Yerevan, but in other provinces of Armenia and within the Armenian Diaspora as well.

Pyunik is considered to be one of the most popular clubs in Armenia, and has one of the biggest Ultras fanbases in Armenia, called Sector 18, named after the sector they occupy at the Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium.

==Rivalries==
Pyunik&#x27;s rivalry with Ararat originates with the creation of the club itself. Pyunik&#x27;s founder Khoren Oganesian, is considered an Ararat club idol, due to his achievements at the club during the Soviet period, winning the 1975 Soviet Cup. Pyunik&#x27;s success in recent history has led the club&#x27;s image to surpass that of Ararat, which has led to arguments over which club has had a bigger impact on Armenian football.

The other rivalry, between Pyunik and Urartu is also known as the clash of Yerevan neighborhoods, since Pyunik is located in the wealthier Kentron neighborhood, whereas Urartu is located in the lower-class Malatia-Sebastia neighborhood. The rivalry between both teams originates from Urartu&#x27;s relocation from Abovyan to Yerevan in 2001, competing with and eventually becoming one of the largest teams in the city. Both teams&#x27; youth academies also compete with each other as they are considered to be two of the best in the country.

<text>FC Nistru Otaci was a Moldovan football club based in Otaci, Moldova. The club was founded on 17 August 1953. It was dissolved in 2017.

==History==
During the 1999–2000 season, the club played as FC Nistru-Unisport Otaci due to Nistru being expelled in the summer of 1999. The club merged with Unisport Chişinău, which allowed Nistru to use Unisport&#x27;s top flight position to play. However, this merger was canceled in 2000, sending Unisport back down to the Divizia A.

In June 2020, club president Vasile Traghira died.

<text>FC Shakhtyor Soligorsk (, ) is a Belarusian Premier League football club, playing in the city of Salihorsk (Soligorsk).

== History ==
The club was founded in 1961. During Soviet era, Shakhtyor Soligorsk played in the top or second division of the Belarusian SSR league, occasionally dropping to lower tiers (Minsk Oblast league) for a short time. In 1971, Shakhtyor absorbed two other local Soligorsk teams (Khimik and Gornyak). Their best results came toward the end of Soviet days, when the team finished as league runners-up twice (1988, 1990) and won the Belarusian SSR Cup three times (1985, 1986, 1988).

Since 1992, Shakhtyor has been playing in Belarusian Premier League. The team struggled through the 1990s, usually fighting against relegation. In 1997, they finished at the last place in the league, but were saved from relegation after two other Premier League clubs withdrew.

After a transitory 1998 season, since 1999, they have never finished below 6th place and became a staple European Cups participant. Shakhtyor Soligorsk became the champions of Belarus in 2005, 2020 and 2021, and were league runners-up six times (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2018). They also won the Belarusian Cup three times (2004, 2014, and 2019).

On May 11, 2023, following a match-fixing scandal, the club was stripped of the 2022 league title and received a 30-point deduction for the following campaign, as well as an additional 20-point deduction the campaign afterwards.

<doc id="833947" wikidata="Q7721462" url="?curid=833947" title="The Cartoon History of the Universe">
<text>The Cartoon History of the Universe is a book series about the history of the world. It is written and illustrated by American cartoonist, professor, and mathematician Larry Gonick, who started the project in 1978. Each book in the series explains a period of world history in a loosely chronological order. They draw upon evolutionary biology and other sciences, and provide citations to sources. 

Though originally published as a comic book series, the series is now published in trade paperback volumes of several hundred pages each. The final two volumes, published in 2007 and 2009, bring 
the narrative up to 2008 and are named &quot;The Cartoon History of the Modern World&quot;, volumes one and two. The books have been translated into many languages, including Portuguese, Greek, Czech and Polish.

== Publication history ==
San Francisco-based underground comix publisher Rip Off Press began publishing &quot;The Cartoon History of the Universe&quot; in 1978, with five volumes being published by 1980. 

Rip Off Press published 9 issues from 1978 to 1992; the first collected edition was published by Doubleday in 1990.

While seeking a book publisher, Gonick received early support from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who worked as an editor at Doubleday and championed &quot;The Cartoon History of the Universe&quot;&#x27;s publication by the company.

== Illustration style ==
&quot;The Cartoon History&quot; is illustrated in a black-and-white cartoon style, other than the coloured covers. Gonick occasionally uses crosshatching and other realistic drawing techniques, but he primarily draws with a lively brush-and-ink squiggle. His drawings resemble Bill Watterson&#x27;s &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;, and René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo&#x27;s &quot;Astérix&quot;. Occasionally, as in the sequences on India in the second book, he mimics Gilbert Shelton&#x27;s style from &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;.

His tribute to &quot;Asterix&quot; is explicit. When Gauls are depicted, not only do they often resemble Goscinny and Uderzo&#x27;s characters Asterix and Obelix, but when Gonick treats the Gallic invasion of Italy (390 – 387 BCE), the characters, along with Vitalstatistix, appear unmistakably (Vitalstatistix is transported on a shield, Asterix pummels a Roman soldier, etc.); and as they trudge off into the sunset, the speech balloon reads &quot;Come on, Asterix! Let&#x27;s get our own comic book&quot;.

== Narrative framework ==
Each volume or chapter begins with a one- or two-panel introduction. An Einstein-like Professor (representing Gonick&#x27;s authorial voice) prepares to travel in his time machine to whatever place or era the chapter is about. The Professor reads a passage from a historical book, which activates the &quot;time machine&quot;, a literary device. For example, the Professor reads a book about dinosaurs to introduce Volume 1 about prehistory, and Volume 4 draws from &quot;part of the Old Testament&quot;. 

He reads from Hans Zinsser&#x27;s &quot;Rats, Lice and History&quot; before Volume 19 about the Black Death. This introduction provides a bridge to the action, the main narrative of each chapter.

== Narrative style and tone ==
=== Point of view ===
Any history book has a point of view, and Larry Gonick&#x27;s might best be described as &quot;humanist&quot;, but it is not written in the style of a didactic textbook. Instead, Gonick fleshes out history into a long yarn, injecting characterization into historical personages, continually reporting gory anecdotes, and focusing on quirky details—all backed up by research—to enliven his subject. He reports both the greatness of human achievement and acknowledges humanity&#x27;s savagery.

In addition to being a chronological history, &quot;The Cartoon History&quot; helps readers understand historical cause and effect—how the past relates to the present. It explains the motivations behind human beings&#x27; discoveries, inventions, explorations, wars, triumphs, and mistakes. Gonick&#x27;s editorial aim seeks to do justice to every point of view.

=== Humor ===
Gonick consistently uses elements of satire to find the most humor in every situation. For example, one cartoon panel depicts the barbarism of a group of Huns who had elephants herded off a cliff for their sadistic enjoyment. One Hun exclaims with an oafish grin, &quot;My emotions are valid!&quot;—juxtaposing the Hun&#x27;s brutal barbarism with an anachronistic, post-modern view of his own cruelty [3].

Also noteworthy is Gonick&#x27;s use of caricature. For example, he depicts the weaselly Robert Guiscard, the 11th-century Norman adventurer, as an anthropomorphic weasel, an allusion to Guiscard&#x27;s name and cunning nature, and depicts Babur, the 16th-century founder of the Mughal Empire with buckteeth (an allusion to the theory that the conqueror&#x27;s name means &quot;beaver&quot;).

== Unorthodox citations ==
Consistently enthusiastic in tone, for the first five volumes Gonick uses the last page to recommend further reading, in prehistory, archaeology and history. But rather than relying upon an ordinary, typeset bibliography, Gonick sustains his unorthodox style and exuberant tone as the Professor takes the reader through a cartoon tour of his sources.

Because much of &quot;The Cartoon History&quot; covers evolutionary science, physics, astronomy, and ancient history, Gonick has referenced original writings on these subjects, rather than relying on secondary sources or anthologies. Some of these primary sources are national epics, cultural writings, or holy scriptures, such as Homer&#x27;s Iliad, the Rig Veda of India, and the Bible. In this way he prompts his readers also to read the primary sources.

==The series==
Beginning with its original comic book &quot;Volume 1&quot; in 1977, the complete series covers world history through 2008.

<doc id="833962" wikidata="Q1022453" url="?curid=833962" title="C. D. Broad">
<text>Charlie Dunbar Broad (30 December 1887 – 11 March 1971), usually cited as C. D. Broad, was an English epistemologist, historian of philosophy, philosopher of science, moral philosopher, and writer on the philosophical aspects of psychical research. He was known for his thorough and dispassionate examinations of arguments in such works as &quot;Scientific Thought&quot; (1923), &quot;The Mind and Its Place in Nature&quot; (1925), and &quot;Examination of McTaggart&#x27;s Philosophy&quot; (2 vols., 1933–1938).

Broad&#x27;s essay on &quot;Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism&quot; in &quot;Ethics and the History of Philosophy&quot; (1952) introduced the philosophical terms &quot;occurrent causation&quot; and &quot;non-occurrent causation&quot;, which became the basis for the contemporary distinction between &quot;agent-causal&quot; and &quot;event-causal&quot; in debates on libertarian free will.

== Biography ==
Broad was born in Harlesden, in Middlesex, England.

He was educated at Dulwich College from 1900 until 1906. He gained a scholarship in 1906 to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1910 with First-Class Honours, with distinction. He became a Fellow of Trinity College the following year.

=== Career ===
As his fellowship at Trinity College was a non-residential position, he was also able to accept a position as an assistant lecturer that he had applied for at St Andrews University, where he remained until 1920. That year, he was appointed professor at Bristol University, working there until 1923, when he returned to Trinity as a lecturer. From 1926 until 1931, he was a lecturer in &#x27;moral science&#x27; at Cambridge University&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy.

Later at Cambridge, he was appointed in 1931 as &#x27;Sidgwick Lecturer&#x27;, a role he would keep until 1933, when he was appointed Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at the university, a position he held for twenty years (until 1953). In 1927 he gave the British Academy&#x27;s Master-Mind Lecture, entitled &quot;Sir Isaac Newton.&quot;

In addition, Broad was President of the Aristotelian Society from 1927 to 1928, and again from 1954 to 1955. He was also President of the Society for Psychical Research in 1935 and 1958.

=== Personal life ===
Broad was openly homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. In March 1958, Broad along with fellow philosophers A. J. Ayer and Bertrand Russell, writer J.B. Priestley and 27 others sent a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; which urged the acceptance of the &quot;Wolfenden Report&#x27;s&quot; recommendation that homosexual acts should &quot;no longer be a criminal offence.&quot;

== Theory ==

=== Psychical research ===
Broad argued that if research could demonstrate that psychic events occur, this would challenge philosophical theories of &quot;basic limiting principles&quot; in at least five ways:

# Backward causation (i.e., the future affecting the past) is rejected by many philosophers, but would be shown to occur if, for example, people could predict the future.
# One common argument against dualism (i.e., the belief that, while bodies are physical entities, minds are a different, non-physical sort of entity) is that physical and non-physical things cannot interact. However, this would be shown to be possible if people can move physical objects by thought (telekinesis).
# Similarly, philosophers tend to be skeptical about claims that non-physical &#x27;stuff&#x27; could interact with anything. This would also be challenged if minds are shown to be able to communicate with each other, as would be the case if mind-reading is possible.
# Philosophers generally accept that we can only learn about the world through reason and perception. This belief would be challenged if people were able to psychically perceive events in other places.
# Physicalist philosophers believe that there cannot be persons without bodies. If ghosts were shown to exist, this view would be challenged.
In his 1949 paper, Broad examined the implications of research by British parapsychologist Samuel Soal, who claimed to have discovered a subject, Basil Shackleton, capable of guessing the identity of Zener cards with odds of &#x27;billions to one&#x27;. However, the validity of these findings was later questioned by Betty Markwick, following testimony from a colleague suggesting that Soal had manipulated both data and experiment methods. 

=== Free will ===
In his essay &quot;Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism&quot;, Broad argued for non-occurrent causation as &quot;literally determined by the agent or self.&quot; The agent could be considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent. Thus, our efforts would be completely determined, but their causes would not be prior events. New series of events would then originate, which he called &quot;continuants&quot;, which are essentially &quot;causa sui&quot;.

Peter van Inwagen says that Broad formulated an excellent version of what van Inwagen has called the &quot;Consequence Argument&quot; in defence of incompatibilism.

===Metaphilosophy and science===
Broad distinguished between critical philosophy and speculative philosophy. He described critical philosophy as analysing &quot;unanalysed concepts in daily life and in science&quot; and then &quot;expos[ing] them to every objection that we can think of&quot;. While speculative philosophy&#x27;s role is to &quot;take over all aspects of human experience, to reflect upon them, and to try to think out a view of Reality as a whole which shall do justice to all of them&quot;. 

One aspect of critical philosophy was the Principle of Exceptional Cases, whereby everyday concepts are considered in highly abnormal cases, so as to &quot;clear up the meaning&quot; of a concept.

Broad saw philosophy and science as supplemental to one another. Scientists who ignore philosophy expose themselves to a &quot;danger to which the natural scientist is peculiarly liable. The extraordinary success of physics and chemistry within their own sphere tempts men to think that the world is simply a physico-chemical system&quot;. Whereas philosophers who ignore science are ignoring properties which are &quot;very pervasive&quot; and can shed light on things. 

In terms of empirical propositions Broad distinguished between inspective empirical propositions which he defined &quot;one which asserts of some particular existent with which the mind is acquainted at the time some property which the mind can notice by inspection to belong to it&quot; and inferred empirical propositions which are &quot;derived from a number of perceptual propositions either directly by pure inductive generalization, or indirectly by deduction from one or more inductive generalizations&quot;.

<text>Budapest Honvéd Football Club (), commonly known as Budapest Honvéd or simply Honvéd, is a Hungarian sports club based in Kispest, Budapest, with the colours of red and black. The club is best known for its football team. &quot;Honvéd&quot; means the Homeland Defence. Originally formed as &quot;Kispest AC&quot;, they became &quot;Kispest FC&quot; in 1926 before reverting to their original name in 1944.

The team enjoyed a golden age during the 1950s when it was renamed &quot;Budapesti Honvéd SE&quot; and became the Hungarian Army team. The club&#x27;s top players from this era, Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis, József Bozsik, Zoltán Czibor, and Gyula Grosics helped the club win the Hungarian League four times during the 1950s and also formed the nucleus of the legendary Hungary national team popularly known as the &quot;Mighty Magyars.&quot;

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the club enjoyed another successful period, winning a further eight Hungarian League titles. They also won league and cup doubles in 1985 and 1989. In 1991, the club was renamed &quot;Kispest Honvéd FC&quot; and adopted its current name in 2003.

When the club was originally formed in 1909, it also organised teams that competed in fencing, cycling, gymnastics, wrestling, athletics, boxing, and tennis. Later, the Honvéd family was extended to include a water polo team, now known as &quot;Groupama Honvéd&quot;, a 33-times basketball-champion team and a handball team that were European Champions in 1982.

==History==

Budapest Honvéd FC were founded in 1909 as Kispesti AC. At domestic level they first entered the Nemzeti Bajnokság I in the 1916–17 season. Their first success came in the 1926 Magyar Kupa season when they beat Budapesti EAC in the final. The club had played in the first division since 1916, until the club got relegated to the second division in 2003. 

==Stadium==
Budapest Honvéd&#x27;s first stadium was opened in 1913. On 5 August 2018, the last match was played at the stadium. The match was won by Honvéd against Paksi FC on the 3rd match day of the 2018–19 Nemzeti Bajnokság I. The only goal was scored by Danilo in the 48th minute. The referee was Viktor Kassai. The stadium was demolished in 2019.

The new stadium of the club was opened in 2021. The first match was played between Budapest Honvéd FC II and Szekszárdi UFC in the 2020–21 Nemzeti Bajnokság III season. The stadium was selected to host the 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

==Ownership==

In 2022, Chris Docherty was appointed as the new sport director of the club.

Chris Docherty said in an interview that the club cannot sign any new players for financial problems in the middle of the 2022-23 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season.

On 22 May 2023, Chris Docherty resigned as sports director. In an article published by Nemzeti Sport, George F. Hemingway, former owner of the club, heavily criticized the management of the club for their relegation to the Nemzeti Bajnokság II after finishing 11th in the 2022–23 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season. Hemingway said that the solid financial background is not enough if there is no expertise.

On 27 April 2024, it was revealed that a Tamás Lisztinger-led business showed interest in purchasing the club.

<text>The National Galleries of Scotland (, sometimes also known as National Galleries Scotland) is the executive non-departmental public body that controls the three national galleries of Scotland and two partner galleries, forming one of the National Collections of Scotland.

The purpose of National Galleries Scotland (NGS) was set out by an Act of Parliament in the National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906, amended by the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985. Its role is to manage the National Galleries of Scotland, care for, preserve and add to the objects in its collections, exhibit artworks to the public and to promote education and public enjoyment and understanding of the Fine Arts. It is governed by a board of trustees who are appointed by ministers of the Scottish Government.

==History==

The National Gallery of Scotland (now called the National) was opened to the public in 1859. Located on The Mound in the centre of Scotland&#x27;s capital city, Edinburgh, the building was originally shared between the National Gallery and the collection of the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). The gallery was a success, and in response to increasing public demand for the celebration of Scottish history and culture, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (SNPG) was opened in 1889 to display portraits of noted Scots. The National Gallery collection was nevertheless constrained by lack of space in the premises on The Mound, and the (6 Edw. 7. c. 50) granted to the RSA perpetual tenancy of the Royal Institution building in front of the National Gallery, allowing the National Galleries collection to take over the entire National Gallery of Scotland building. Since then, the Royal Institution building became known as the Royal Scottish Academy.

In 1959, National Galleries of Scotland expanded further with the establishment of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (SNGMA), housed in Inverleith House in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Twentieth-century artworks in the National Galleries collection were relocated to the new gallery, and the gallery began to acquire many more objects after 1960. By 1984, the modern art gallery had outgrown its first home, and the SNGMA relocated to the vacant John Watson&#x27;s Institution building, a former school. In 1999, the SNGMA expanded with the opening of 
The Dean Gallery (now called Modern Two) in a former orphanage opposite the Gallery of Modern Art.

In 2012, National Galleries of Scotland underwent a rebranding exercise, and the National Gallery of Scotland building on The Mound was renamed the &quot;Scottish National Gallery&quot; to distinguish it from the organisation that manages it.

A further rebranding was undertaken in 2023, when the organisation&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;National Galleries Scotland&quot;. A new visual identity was introduced, including a three-dimensional logo consisting of a pair coloured rectangles placed at an angle, said to &quot;evoke the idea of discovery and different perspectives&quot;. The names of the individual gallery buildings were considered to be too long, and were given &quot;snappier and more memorable&quot; names within the branding family: &quot;National&quot;, &quot;Portrait&quot; and &quot;Modern&quot;.

<text>Sir Eduardo Luigi Paolozzi (, ; 7 March 1924 – 22 April 2005) was a Scottish artist, known for his sculpture and graphic works. He is widely considered to be one of the pioneers of pop art.

==Early years==

Eduardo Luigi Paolozzi was born on 7 March, 1924, in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland, and was the eldest son of Italian immigrants. His family was from Viticuso, in the Lazio region. Paolozzi&#x27;s parents, Rodolfo and Carmela, ran an ice cream shop. Paolozzi used to spend all his summers at his grandparents place in Monte Cassino and grew up bilingual. In June 1940, when Italy declared war on the United Kingdom, Paolozzi was interned (along with most other Italian men in Britain). During his three-month internment at Saughton prison his father, grandfather and uncle, who had also been detained, were among the 446 Italians who drowned when the ship carrying them to Canada, the &quot;Arandora Star&quot;, was sunk by a German U-boat.

Paolozzi studied at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1943, briefly at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in 1944, and then at the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London from 1944 to 1947, after which he worked in Paris. While in Paris from 1947 to 1949, Paolozzi became acquainted with Alberto Giacometti, Jean Arp, Constantin Brâncuși, Georges Braque and Fernand Léger. This period became an important influence for his later work. For example, the influence of Giacometti and many of the original Surrealists he met in Paris can be felt in the group of lost-wax sculptures made by Paolozzi in the mid-1950s. Their surfaces, studded with found objects and machine parts, were to gain him recognition.

==Career==
After Paris, he moved back to London eventually establishing his studio in Chelsea. The studio was a workshop filled with hundreds of found objects, models, sculptures, materials, tools, toys and stacks of books. Paolozzi was interested in everything and would use a variety of objects and materials in his work, particularly his collages. In 1955 he moved with his family to the village of Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex. Together with Nigel Henderson he established Hammer Prints Limited, a design company producing wallpapers, textiles and ceramics that were initially manufactured at Landermere Wharf, and when his evening course in printed textile design at the Central School of Art and Design attracted the Trinidadian graphics student Althea McNish, he was instrumental in pointing her towards her future career as a textile designer. Paolozzi came to public attention in the 1950s by producing a range of striking screenprints and Art brut sculpture. He was a founder of the Independent Group in 1952, which is regarded as the precursor to the mid-1950s British and late 1950s American Pop Art movements. His seminal 1947 collage &quot;I was a Rich Man&#x27;s Plaything&quot; is considered the earliest standard bearer representing Pop Art. He always described his work as surrealist art and, while working in a wide range of media though his career, became more closely associated with sculpture. Paolozzi is recognized for producing largely lifelike statuary works, but with rectilinear (often cubic) elements added or removed, or the human form deconstructed in a cubist manner.

He taught sculpture and ceramics at several institutions, including the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (1960–62), University of California, Berkeley (in 1968) and at the Royal College of Art. Paolozzi had a long association with Germany, having worked in Berlin from 1974 as part of the Berlin Artist Programme of the German Academic Exchange Programme. He was a professor at the Fachhochschule in Cologne from 1977 to 1981, and later taught sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich. Paolozzi was fond of Munich and many of his works and concept plans were developed in a studio he kept there, including the mosaics of the Tottenham Court Road Station in London. He took a stab at industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale &quot;Suomi&quot; tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Paolozzi decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker&#x27;s &quot;Studio Linie&quot;.

Paolozzi&#x27;s graphic work of the 1960s was highly innovative. In a series of works he explored and extended the possibilities and limits of the silkscreen medium. The resulting prints are characterised by Pop culture references and technological imagery. These series are: &quot;As Is When&quot; (12 prints on the theme of Paolozzi&#x27;s interest in the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein; published as a limited edition of 65 by Editions Alecto, 1965); &quot;Moonstrips Empire News&quot; (100 prints, eight signed, in an acrylic box; published as a limited edition of 500 by Editions Alecto, 1967); &quot;Universal Electronic Vacuu&quot; (10 prints, poster and text; published by Paolozzi as a limited edition of 75, 1967); &quot;General Dynamic Fun&quot;. (part 2 of &quot;Moonstrips Empire News&quot;; 50 sheets plus title sheet; boxed in five versions; published as a limited edition of 350 by Editions Alecto, 1970).

In the 1960s and 1970s, Paolozzi artistically processed man-machine images from popular science books by German doctor and author Fritz Kahn (1888–1968), such as in his screenprint &quot;Wittgenstein in New York&quot; (1965), the print series &quot;Secrets of Life – The Human Machine and How it Works&quot; (1970), or the cover design for John Barth&#x27;s novel &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; (Penguin, 1972). As recently as 2009, the reference to Kahn was discovered by Uta and Thilo von Debschitz during their research of work and life of Fritz Kahn.

==Later career==

Paolozzi was appointed CBE in 1968 and in 1979 he was elected to the Royal Academy. In 1967, he started contributing to literary magazine &quot;Ambit&quot;, which began a lifelong collaboration.

In 1980, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) commissioned a set of three tapestries from Paolozzi to represent &#x27;present day and future societies in relation to the role played by ICAEW&#x27;, as part of the institute&#x27;s centenary celebrations. The three highly distinctive pieces – which Paolozzi wanted to &quot;depict our world of today in a manner using the same bold pictorial style as the Bayeux tapestries in France&quot; – currently hang in Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall.

He was promoted to the office of Her Majesty&#x27;s Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland in 1986, which he held until his death. He also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1987.

Paolozzi was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1989 as Knight Bachelor ().

In 1994, Paolozzi gave the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art a large body of his works, and much of the content of his studio. In 1999 the National Galleries of Scotland opened the Dean Gallery to display this collection. The gallery displays a recreation of Paolozzi&#x27;s studio, with its contents evoking the original London and Munich locations and also houses a Scottish-Italian restaurant, Paolozzi&#x27;s Kitchen, which was created by Heritage Portfolio in homage to the local artist.

In 2001, Paolozzi suffered a near-fatal stroke, causing an incorrect magazine report that he had died. The illness made him a wheelchair user, and he died in a hospital in London in April 2005.

In 2013, Pallant House Gallery in Chichester held a major retrospective &quot;Eduardo Paolozzi: Collaging Culture&quot; (6 July −13 October 2013), featuring more than 100 of the artist&#x27;s works, including sculpture, drawings, textile, film, ceramics and paper collage. Pallant House Gallery has an extensive collection of Paolozzi&#x27;s work given and loaned by the architect Colin St John Wilson, who commissioned Paolozzi&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Newton After Blake&quot; for the British Library.

<text>Monongalia County is a former county in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It was identified in 1858, although the Dakota War of 1862 delayed its organization until 1861. It was named after Monongalia County, Virginia (now Monongalia County, West Virginia) after residents moved from Virginia to Minnesota. The county seat was at New London, after a brief stay at Columbia.

In 1870 the state legislature ordered it merged with Kandiyohi County, its southern neighbor. Neither county had been able up till then to raise enough money to build a courthouse. In February 1871, they finally agreed to make Willmar the new county seat, succeeding to Kandiyohi Station.

<doc id="834030" wikidata="Q4749822" url="?curid=834030" title="An Assassin's Diary">
<text>An Assassin&#x27;s Diary () is a book written by Arthur Bremer and Harding Lemay and released in 1973. It was based on part of the diary of Bremer, the would-be assassin of Alabama governor George Wallace. Bremer shot Wallace on May 15, 1972, at the Laurel Shopping Center in Laurel, Maryland, while Wallace was in the midst of his third campaign for President.

In the book, Bremer says he was not particularly opposed to Wallace&#x27;s political agenda, which many had branded as white supremacist; his primary motive was to become famous as he had also stalked President Richard Nixon.

Paul Schrader was partly inspired by Bremer&#x27;s diary when he wrote the screenplay for the 1976 film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, which was directed by Martin Scorsese. Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Family Snapshot,&quot; from &quot;Peter Gabriel (III)&quot; was inspired by &quot;An Assassin&#x27;s Diary&quot;.

==Reviews==
In the essay &quot;The Art and Arts of E. Howard Hunt&quot;, Gore Vidal assesses Bremer&#x27;s writing style and notes the apparent contradiction between Bremer&#x27;s lucid prose and his characterization as a person with a mediocre intellect. Vidal further speculates that CIA agent E. Howard Hunt may have authored parts of Bremer&#x27;s supposed diary, arguing there are similarities between Bremer&#x27;s writing style and the prose found in Hunt&#x27;s adventure and espionage novels, and noting Bremer&#x27;s supposed diary alternates between passages of clear writing and passages of extreme misspelling and poor grammar.

<text>The counts of Albon () were members of the medieval nobility in what is now south-eastern France.

Guigues IV, Count of Albon (d. 1142) was nicknamed or &#x27;the Dolphin&#x27;. His nickname morphed into a title among his successors. By 1293, the lands ruled by the Counts Albon, the old , were known as the Dauphiné of Viennois ().

The titles and lands had been part of the Holy Roman Empire since 1032. They passed to Philip VI of France in 1349 on condition that the heir apparent to the French crown always be titled , and be personal holder of the lands and titles. By condition of the emperor, the Dauphiny could never be united to France. When the king of France had no son, he would personally rule the Dauphiny separately, as dauphin. Thus, the province technically remained in the Holy Roman Empire even after 1349, and it was administered separately from France well into the early modern period; it was incorporated into France only &quot;de facto&quot; with the rise of absolutism in the 17th century.

<doc id="834099" wikidata="Q2664788" url="?curid=834099" title="Abeir-Toril">
<text>Abeir-Toril is the fictional planet that makes up the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting, as well as the Al-Qadim and Maztica campaign settings, and the 1st edition version of the Oriental Adventures campaign setting.

The name means &quot;cradle of life&quot; in an archaic fictional language of the setting. It consists of various continents and islands, including Faerûn, Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica, Osse, Anchorome and Katashaka, a sub-Saharan-like continent south of Maztica, where humanity appeared. Toril was originally the name of Jeff Grubb&#x27;s personal campaign world before part of it was merged with Ed Greenwood&#x27;s Forgotten Realms setting.

==Publishing history==
Toril was the name of Jeff Grubb&#x27;s campaign world, and was adopted as the name of the planet upon which the continent of Faerûn existed when he and Ed Greenwood were designing the original &quot;Forgotten Realms Boxed Set&quot; in 1987. Greenwood had written tales for his world &quot;as far back as 1967&quot; and &quot;it had been the setting for his homespun D&amp;D campaigns since 1978&quot;. Abeir- was added as a prefix to the planet&#x27;s name so that it would be the first entry in the alphabetical encyclopedia of terms included in the set. The setting&#x27;s entire planet underwent a major change during the 1989 &quot;Avatar&quot; trilogy, which detailed a series of events called the Time of Troubles, during which gods walked the earth and magic became unpredictable. These events caused permanent changes in gameplay that were outlined in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition campaign setting books. In this edition, Abeir-Toril was considered one of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s three main worlds, along with Krynn and Oerth.

In a significant retcon of the setting&#x27;s history, &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; material for the fourth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;reveals&quot; that the world was split in two in prehistory, divided between the primordials (Abeir) and the gods (Toril). Toril is the world that has been showcased so far. A cataclysm called the Spellplague has caused several parts of the two worlds to switch places, displacing portions of Faerûn and the entire continent of Maztica, with regions of Abeir: Tymanther, Akanûl, and Returned Abeir. A subsequent event called &quot;The Sundering&quot; reverted many of these changes and restored much of the pre-Spellplague Toril.

Abeir-Toril is the default world for the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

==Fictional continents==
===Anchorome===

Anchorome is almost unexplored and is at the North of Maztica. Its best-known inhabitants are the &quot;Azuposi&quot;, as well as the defunct &quot;Esh Alakarans&quot; and the xenophobic Poscadar elves. There is also a sahuagin realm called Itzcali located in the sea nearby.

The character Balduran, a sea captain and founder of Baldur&#x27;s Gate, sails to Anchorome and returns with a great wealth which is used to build the wall around the fledgling Baldur&#x27;s Gate. In the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast&quot; expansion, it is revealed that Balduran returns to Anchorome and retrieves a second hoard of treasure from the Native kingdoms. When he attempts to take on a number of locals to replenish his crew, he discovers they are infected with lycanthropy. The resulting battle shipwrecks Balduran on an island, which is later discovered by a Merchant Guild from Baldur&#x27;s Gate and subsequently by the player who is sent to confirm the finding, where both the original crews&#x27; and the natives from Anchorome&#x27;s descendants are locked in a bloody lycanthrope feud. The fate of Balduran himself is never clearly revealed.

After the discovery of Maztica by the mercenary captain Cordell, mercenaries from the Flaming Fist are sent to Anchorome. They build a keep, Fort Flame, in the shores of Balduran&#x27;s bay (which is actually far below Balduran&#x27;s resting place) but other than this it has been a complete disaster.

It is speculated that it is the land where the Creator Race known as the &quot;Aearee&quot; retreated a long time ago. It is rumored that several tribes of thri-kreen make their home in Anchorome&#x27;s western regions.

===Faerûn===

The continent of Faerûn is the primary setting of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; and the part of Toril most detailed in stories and supplements.

===Kara-Tur===
Kara-Tur&#x27;s cultures and peoples are fantasy analogues of medieval regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Tibet, and others. According to Jim Bambra, &quot;while primarily drawing on Japan for inspiration, [Kara-Tur] also contains elements of medieval China and Korea&quot;. Kara-Tur was first described in the original 1985 &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; book. A reviewer for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; called the long background section of Kara-Tur in the book, a &quot;bonus&quot;. Originally intended as a western part of the continent of Oerik in the Greyhawk setting, the description of Kara-Tur in the &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; rulebook made no attempt to link it with another D&amp;D game-world. The first map of Kara-Tur appeared in the adventure module OA1: &quot;Swords of the Daimyo&quot; (1986), where the setting was still world-neutral. The 1987 &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Set&quot; left the eastern half of its continent reserved for the future publication of Kara-Tur. In 1988, TSR released a boxed set, &quot;Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms&quot;, describing the region in greater detail, with two 96-page books and maps. In the process of adapting the setting to the Forgotten Realms, the size of the continent was scaled down significantly.

The ten distinct nations and regions described in the boxed set and their real-world analogues include:
* Shou Lung: Imperial China during periods of centralized government
* T&#x27;u Lung: Historical China during eras of political disunity, e.g. the Warring States period
* Wa: Feudal Japan (Edo/Kamakura period)
* Kozakura: Japan (Feudal/Sengoku period)
* Northern Wastes: Historical Eastern Siberia
* Tabot: Tibet
* Koryo: Korea
* The Island Kingdoms: Pre-colonial civilizations of Indonesia and the Philippines.
* The Plain of Horses: Historical Mongolia. This region is the Kara-Tur portion of the Hordelands, also known as the Endless Wastes. 
* The Jungle Lands of Malatra: Pre-colonial civilizations of Indochina (historical versions of the Khmer Empire and Vietnam) as well as the hill tribes inspired by their real-life Southeast Asian counterparts.

In 1989 a printing of &quot;Trail Maps&quot; for Kara-Tur appeared as part of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition. In 1990 the maps were again included in &quot;The Forgotten Realms Atlas&quot;. Later that year TSR converted the monsters of Kara-Tur to second edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules as part of the &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; series. After 1990, TSR ceased publishing new material related to Kara-Tur. The setting was, however, occasionally referred to by other TSR products such as &quot;Spelljammer&quot; and &quot;Ravenloft&quot;.

The setting of Kara-Tur still exists on Abeir-Toril in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition and is often mentioned in Forgotten Realms supplements. Characters and artifacts from Kara-Tur sometimes show up in Faerûn, but beyond that there is little interaction between the continents. The 2015 release of &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, a supplement for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition, introduced Kara-Tur to the fifth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. There is a brief description of the land along with references throughout the book to its culture and how certain classes or backgrounds might fit in there.

Reviewer Michael Mullen, looking at the setting of Kara-Tur before the publication of the boxed set, stated that players would probably like the world, but that it would depend largely on how familiar the DM was with Oriental culture or Japanese movies and television. He remarked that the &quot;usual opposition, if not human, will be from the spirit world&quot;, rather than more conventional battles versus monsters. Game studies scholar Aaron Trammell commented that &quot;Although Gary Gygax envisioned a campaign setting that brought a multicultural dimension to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the reality is that by lumping together Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Philippine, and &#x27;Southeast Asian&#x27; lore he and co-authors David &#x27;Zeb&#x27; Cook and Francois Marcela-Froideval actually developed a campaign setting that reinforced western culture&#x27;s already racist understanding of the &#x27;Orient&#x27;.&quot;

===Maztica===
Maztica, called by its inhabitants &quot;The True World&quot;, is a fictional continent that is a land of jungles and (to the Faerûnians) mystery. The area was heavily inspired by Aztec and Mayan culture.

Early in its fictional history it was a land fought over by the gods Qotal the Plumed Serpent and his brother Zaltec. For a crime against his sister, Qotal retreated from Maztica for an age but returned in recent times.

It was &#x27;discovered&#x27; by Amnian explorers led by one Captain-general Cordell and his Golden Legion in 1361 DR. Amn was quick to carve out its claim to the land for trade benefits, establishing the port city of Helmsport, and the church of Helm led the encroachment into the new land. The native peoples were devastated by foreign diseases and the ruthlessness of the invaders, and this, coupled with the difficulties encountered on Maztica backfiring against them, caused the church of Helm to come under heavy criticism. Lantan also claimed some lands.

Maztica is divided into the nations of Nexal, Kultaka, Huacli, Kolan, Pezelac, and Payit. The region known as Far Payit neighbours Payit, both in the east around Helmsport. The native people of Maztica from Payit and Far Payit are known as Payits, whereas natives from the other nations are known as Mazticans. There are also the human races known as the Dog People and the Green Folk. Many monstrous races also live in Maztica, including wild halflings and Chacs—jaguar spirits. In very old times, couatl came from Maztica to fight the Yuan-Ti of Chult.

Some scorpionfolk from Maztica found an Underdark passage to the Underdark of Faerûn.

North of Maztica is the continent of Anchorome. South of it (and separated by a strait) lies an unknown continent.

Maztica was detailed for 2nd Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in the &quot;Maztica Campaign Set&quot; by Douglas Niles, and in the Forgotten Realms novels of the Maztica Trilogy—&quot;Ironhelm&quot;, &quot;Viperhand&quot; and &quot;Feathered Dragon&quot;—also by Douglas Niles. It was based on historical Central America.

In a retrospective review in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Scott Taylor found Maztica unimpressive because the continent too closely mirrored the Mesoamerican world, down to the history of the Conquistadores, rather than creating a uniquely fantasy version inspired by the &quot;colorful and diverse&quot; reality that is Mesoamerica. CBR author Matthew England considered it &quot;a rarity in the fantasy genre&quot; to base a continent on these cultures.

Maztica was also the name of the elder goddess who embodied the land of Maztica. Killed by her own son Zaltec, she was the wife of dead Kukul, but unlike her husband, continues to live on in the continued existence of the continent.

In 4th edition, the Spellplague caused by Mystra&#x27;s death caused Abeir and Toril to briefly merge and then instantly rip apart again. As a result, Maztica is no longer a part of Toril, having been replaced with a continent called &quot;Returned Abeir&quot;. On some maps, it has been renamed Anchorome.

===Zakhara===
Zakhara is a fictional realm styled after the themes and setting depicted in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. The land is the setting of the Al-Qadim campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; tabletop role-playing game. Zakhara is a giant peninsula of the same supercontinent that hosts Faerûn and Kara-Tur on the planet Abeir-Toril. Zakhara is located east of Faerûn, and the closest Faerûnian lands to Zakhara are Dambrath (by sea) and Ulgarth or arguably Konigheim (by land). Zakhara is mostly isolated from the rest of the world, as the peninsula is separated from the main mass by the World Pillar Mountains (also known as Wu Pi Te Shao in Kara-Tur).

The Zakharan pantheon consists of several cultures, like the culture of Enlightenment and more savage deities, such as Ragarra.

Waters around Zakhara are bountiful with pirates and corsairs who charge traders tolls to cross &quot;their&quot; seas, such traders willingly pay these exorbitant fees as Zakhara&#x27;s exotic trading goods tend to be well worth the price back in Faerûn. Occasionally the pirates decide to completely cut off Zakhara from Faerûn.

The land is full of secretive cities, unwelcoming to travellers, huge deserts, lush oases and powerful genies who meddle in the affairs of humans frequently. The continent is ruled by a theocracy headed by the Grand Caliph, and tales tell of demon-infested cities and godless sorcerers (like the genie-binding Sha&#x27;irs) wielding strange magic. Powerful magic and great warriors of every like are to be found in Zakhara.

Zakharans are firmly convinced they are more civilized than the rest of the world and treat &quot;barbarians&quot; accordingly.

The capital city of Zakhara is Huzuz, the &quot;City of Delights&quot;.

The setting itself proclaimed to have &quot;much more in common with early Hollywood depcitons rather than hard historical fact.&quot;

In the view of Myles Balfe, the Fantasy &quot;Orient&quot; of Zakhara has been designed as a new and exotic counter-realm for players to experience, contrasting with more common settings depicted as &quot;a moralized neo-medieval Europe&quot;. It is presented &quot;as a chaotic, alien space&quot;. In some depictions Balfe sees the Arabic-style cities of the continent connected to erotic ideas of the harem and the &quot;Arabian courtesan&quot;, tropes from Orientalist fiction. In his view the ruling Grand Caliph – &quot;the symbolic figurehead of the entire Land of Fate&quot; – is depicted as impotent to protect his own harem, so that he and his land are dependent on western-style heroic characters to save them.

==Other features==
===Tears of Selûne===
The Tears of Selûne are a pack of asteroids trailing Abeir-Toril&#x27;s moon, Selûne.

===Wu Pi Te Shao===
Known as the World Pillar Mountains in Faerûn or Wu Pi Te Shao in Kara-Tur, the &quot;Roof of the World&quot; is the largest mountain range in the fictional fantasy world of Toril. It is inhabited by evil Yak-men and separates Zakhara from the rest of the supercontinent.

===Yal-Tengri===
Yal-Tengri (also known as The Great Ice Sea) is Toril&#x27;s equivalent of the Arctic Ocean. It is barely known at all. In the ancient time, the major city on its shore was Winterkeep; it is now the trade city of Naupau, in Sossal. Far in the north of the sea is a small island dominated by a cathedral-like spire, inhabited by gnomes of Gond.

The Yal-Tengri is free of ice for the six summer months of the year

The Endless Ice Sea is the name of the western Faerûn part of it. Somewhere there is Jhothûn, the long-forgotten capital of a mighty empire of Giants.

==Reception and analysis==
Philip J. Clements referred to &quot;the world of the highly popular &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; series&quot; as &quot;an unusually well-developed D&amp;D setting&quot;, which has great variety among its fantasy races. A number of human cultures in different regions take their inspirations from real-world cultures.

Daniel T. Kline summed up Abeir-Toril as a &quot;vast, high-fantasy, neo-medievalist world&quot;.

&quot;CBR&quot; writer Jared King considered the history of the world of Toril &quot;full of deep lore crafted over decades of editions&quot; and found the Dawn War, a conflict involving the gods in the ancient past of the setting, especially fascinating.

In comparison to other &quot;D&amp;D&quot; worlds, Aidan-Paul Canavan found Toril &quot;more illustrative&quot; and that it &quot;became further codified and developed over time&quot; than the world of &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, and &quot;militarily more stable and thus may lead to more &#x27;adventure&#x27; based missions&quot; compared to the focus on wars within Krynn/Ansalon. In Canavan&#x27;s view, Toril more closely resembled Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Hyborian Age, as both are &quot;constructed as a patchwork or mosaic of kingdoms, realms and lands, many borrowing directly from historical settings&quot;. Even though &quot;pseudo-medieval European analogues&quot; were predominant, a great variety in environments and cultures could be encountered in the setting. The regions of Toril were given many details and relationships among each other in various game products. As a world designed for role-playing games it has a static character: where main characters in fantasy settings designed for novels could drastically change the world, the descriptions of Toril have to be &quot;re-usable&quot; for various groups of players. There were, however, significant changes made to the world to accommodate rule changes between different editions of the game, explained through magical events within the fictional universe.

Areas of the planet inspired by non-Western real-world cultures, namely Chult, Kara-Tur, Maztica and &quot;Al-Qadim&quot;&#x27;s Zakhara, have been criticized for perpetuating simplistic and harmful stereotypes. In July 2020, Wizards of the Coast added a sensitivity disclaimer to digitally sold products describing such regions, to acknowledge and distance themselves from problematic content.

Medievalist Amy S. Kaufman listed Kara-Tur and the Anauroch desert of Faerûn in 2010 as two of the few fantastic realms based on non-European medieval cultures to date. She remarked that the setting descriptions &quot;reinforce their distance from the &quot;real&quot; Middle Ages&quot;, &quot;which suggests that the [non-Western] realms may be outside the imaginative limits of designers, at least for now&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; author Derek Garcia questioned the use of Abeir-Toril &quot;as the default setting of modern-day &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&quot;, as he saw many problematic stereotypes published in the game&#x27;s history as associated with this world.

<text>In mathematics, a superparticular ratio, also called a superparticular number or epimoric ratio, is the ratio of two consecutive integer numbers.

More particularly, the ratio takes the form:
:formula_1 where is a positive integer.

Thus:
Superparticular ratios were written about by Nicomachus in his treatise &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot;. Although these numbers have applications in modern pure mathematics, the areas of study that most frequently refer to the superparticular ratios by this name are music theory and the history of mathematics.

==Mathematical properties==
As Leonhard Euler observed, the superparticular numbers (including also the multiply superparticular ratios, numbers formed by adding an integer other than one to a unit fraction) are exactly the rational numbers whose simple continued fraction terminates after two terms. The numbers whose continued fraction terminates in one term are the integers, while the remaining numbers, with three or more terms in their continued fractions, are superpartient.

The Wallis product
: formula_2
represents the irrational number  in several ways as a product of superparticular ratios and their inverses. It is also possible to convert the Leibniz formula for π into an Euler product of superparticular ratios in which each term has a prime number as its numerator and the nearest multiple of four as its denominator:
:formula_3

In graph theory, superparticular numbers (or rather, their reciprocals, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.) arise via the Erdős–Stone theorem as the possible values of the upper density of an infinite graph.

==Other applications==
In the study of harmony, many musical intervals can be expressed as a superparticular ratio (for example, due to octave equivalency, the ninth harmonic, 9/1, may be expressed as a superparticular ratio, 9/8). Indeed, whether a ratio was superparticular was the most important criterion in Ptolemy&#x27;s formulation of musical harmony. In this application, Størmer&#x27;s theorem can be used to list all possible superparticular numbers for a given limit; that is, all ratios of this type in which both the numerator and denominator are smooth numbers.

These ratios are also important in visual harmony. Aspect ratios of 4:3 and 3:2 are common in digital photography, and aspect ratios of 7:6 and 5:4 are used in medium format and large format photography respectively.

==Ratio names and related intervals==
Every pair of adjacent positive integers represent a superparticular ratio, and similarly every pair of adjacent harmonics in the harmonic series (music) represent a superparticular ratio. Many individual superparticular ratios have their own names, either in historical mathematics or in music theory. These include the following:

The root of some of these terms comes from Latin &quot;sesqui-&quot; &quot;one and a half&quot; (from &quot;semis&quot; &quot;a half&quot; and &quot;-que&quot; &quot;and&quot;) describing the ratio 3:2.

<doc id="834120" wikidata="Q3209932" url="?curid=834120" title="La La La Human Steps">
<text>La La La Human Steps was a Québécois contemporary dance group in Canada, active between 1980 and 2015, known for its energetic, acrobatic style involving fast-paced and athletic physical contact. Its signature move was the barrel jump – a gravity-defying, fully horizontal, mid-air barrel roll.

The first mention of the group in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, after the premiere of &quot;Human Sex&quot;, stated:

:&quot;This [performance] integrates punk art music into the dancing - which features the fearless physicality of a group of high-flying and nose-diving performers. There is also the added interest of the dancers producing sound by activating laser-beam instruments with their bodies. […] Yet the style - Miss Lecavalier wears a Merry Widow corset, tights, running shoes and a mustache - is different. There is something touching about seeing a younger generation reinvent a wheel, however naively: this difference in attitude defines our times.&quot;

The troupe collaborated with rock musicians, including David Bowie, David Lang, Frank Zappa, Skinny Puppy, Stephen Luscombe, Pandit Dinesh, Asha Bhosle (West India Company), Einstürzende Neubauten, Janitors Animated (Yves Chamberland), Kevin Shields, David Van Tieghem, Carole Laure, Priya Khajuria, Michel Cusson and Alain Bertrand.

It was formed in 1980 by Édouard Lock under the name Lock-Danseurs and showcased for many years Louise Lecavalier. The group appeared regularly in its hometown of Montreal, Quebec, and all over the world.

In later years the leading soloist of La La La Human Steps was Grace-Anne Powers.

On 2 September 2015 Lock announced that the company had been disbanded owing to insurmountable financial difficulties.

<text>A &quot;zentai&quot; suit () is a skin-tight garment that covers the entire body. The word is a portmanteau of &quot;zenshin taitsu&quot; (). &quot;Zentai&quot; is most commonly made using nylon/spandex blends.

==Use==
The costumes are seen at major sporting events in North America and the United Kingdom. They created internationally recognized personalities of The Green Men, two fans of the Vancouver Canucks NHL team. Various professional street dance/hip hop dance groups use the outfits, such as The Body Poets in the United States and Remix Monkeys in the United Kingdom.
Full-body suits are used for video special effects: their unique colors enable the person wearing the chroma key suit to be digitally removed from a video image. Other applications have included music videos (Black Eyed Peas&#x27; song &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot;, including the live performance at the Super Bowl), breast cancer awareness, fashion modeling on an episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, social anxiety workshops, television (Charlie Kelly as Green Man), a participant in public art project &quot;One &amp; Other&quot;, and social experiments.

===Legal limitations===

Since &quot;zentai&quot; cover one&#x27;s face, a fine of up to €150 may be imposed upon those who wear them publicly in France. Furthermore, some sports leagues, such as Major League Baseball, ban the use of the costume hoods.

==Brands==

Companies have created brands of the suits including &quot;RootSuit&quot; or &quot;Superfan Suit&quot; in the United States, &quot;Bodysocks&quot; or &quot;Second Skins&quot; by Smiffy&#x27;s and Morphsuits in the United Kingdom, and Jyhmiskin in Finland. Morphsuits has achieved relative commercial success internationally. Between January and late October 2010, the company shipped 10,000 to Canada alone. The Morphsuits brand has actively tried to disassociate themselves from the existing &quot;zentai&quot; community. Superfan Suits acknowledges in interviews that the outfits have existed previously. The term &quot;morphsuit&quot; has become a generic term in the process; one New Zealand-based newspaper refers to competing brand Jaskins as &quot;one of the main online morphsuit brands.&quot; Jaskins company founder Josh Gaskin says their origins are unclear, pegging the first usage with &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

<text>Široki Brijeg (, ) is a city and the regional capital of West Herzegovina Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. the town itself had a population of 6,149 and the municipality of 28,929.

== Name ==
Široki Brijeg means &quot;wide hill&quot; in Bosnian. It is sometimes referred to as Široki Brig or simply Široki (&quot;wide&quot;). From 1952 until October 16, 1992, the town was officially called Lištica after the river that runs through it.

== Geography ==
The town is from Mostar, from Međugorje, and from the Adriatic coast (Ploče).

The Široki Brijeg Municipality today numbers around 30,000 people, and the town itself about 13,000. The area of the municipality amounts to . The center of town is at above sea level, while its area is known as &quot;lower Herzegovina&quot;. Almost the entire northern part of the municipality itself, however, belongs to &quot;high Herzegovina&quot;, the highest point being the &quot;Bile stine&quot; (&quot;White Rocks&quot;) near Donji Crnač.

=== Climate ===
Široki Brijeg has mild humid subtropical climate(Köppen climate classification:&quot;Cfa&quot;). Winters are chilly and often cold. Summers are warm to hot.
=== Terrain ===
The wider area of the municipality of Široki Brijeg is located on the characteristic, complex structural forms known as the &quot;high karst zone&quot; in geological terms. The basic characteristic is the rocky limestone relief in various karst forms (sinks, caves, sinkholes, karst fields, etc.), as well as deeply cut valleys with occasional torrents flows. The Široki Brijeg area is located on the direction of tectonic units Rakitno-Hrgud and spreads over Rakitno, Vardi mountains, Mostarsko Blato, Rotimlje and Hrgud to Trebišnjica in the southeast. The area is made-up of up late Jurassic sediments, followed by Cretaceous and Paleogene age layers, then Neogene and Quaternary deposits. Highlights are early Cretaceous dun, well stratified limestone and dolomites. Late Cretaceous deposits, cenoman-turon, are represented by white and pink, massive limestone with the shoot. In Paleogenic layers function Liburnijska and alveolinic-nummulitic limestones, then eocenic flysch, which is represented by marl, sandstone, calcarenite and conglomerates.

Neogenic layers are built of marl, sandy clay, sandstone and conglomerates, and can be found in the vicinity of Grabovo Drage and Mostarsko Blato.

== History ==
=== Ancient period ===
The ruins from the Illyrian period confirm that the area of Široki Brijeg had a large population in pre-historic times. The evidence can be seen on the hill Gradina on the frontier of Mokro and Čerigaj. There is also evidence on the walls of the forts where they had been in past. During the ancient period there was plenty of life in that region. From the Roman period there are remains of a fort (&quot;refugium&quot;) in the village of Biograci and a basilica in Mokro; there are remains of the forts and roads there.

=== Middle ages ===
Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos mentions that Mokriskik was in that area . The basilica in Mokri was built and destroyed several times in the Middle Ages and it was used for its purpose. In her neighbourhood is nekrepola with stećak,which are present elsewhere. There number and size indicate that this region was (from 12th till 15th century) has been very populated and rich. From that period on Kočerin was kept the longest tablet on stećak written with Bosnian Cyrillic, known as Kočerinska ploča („Kočerin tablet&quot;). The residues of middle-age fort can be found in the Bork, close to the source of river Lištica.

=== Ottoman rule ===
After the Turkish conquest in the middle of 15th century the population was mainly rural and in the mountains. Until the middle of 19th century, Herzegovina was cut off from social, cultural and political events in other European countries.

=== World War II and Yugoslavia ===

During the Second World War the Ustaše held the city together with Italian troops. During their presence, the Italians built several forts for observation of the city. A number of prominent Ustaše officials, including Andrija Artuković were educated at the Široki Brijeg school and monastery.

Following the war, the town was renamed Lištica by the Yugoslav government after the river that runs through it. Investment in the city was also very poor. A number of people emigrated to Zagreb and Dalmatia, as well as to Germany as gastarbeiters.

In 1985, the local Communist Party built a monument to the Yugoslav Partisans in the centre of the town.

On 7 April 1992, during the first stages of the Bosnian War, the town was the target of an air raid carried out by the Yugoslav Air Force. Two aircraft that took off from Podgorica fired air-to-air rockets and dropped bombs on the town centre, killing six civilians.

== Settlements ==

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===
Agricultural production in the municipality of Široki Brijeg is mostly reduced to the production for their own use on yards and a minor part of the arable land. It is the production of agricultural products for the market is very small compared to the alternatives, and refers primarily to the production of wine, a little bit in the production of vegetables and flowers, very little in the livestock and milk production.

This resulted in a large percentage of agricultural land is not used- according to latest statistics - even 60% that could be used for agricultural land is not processed.

The lack of clear government strategy and orientation towards the launching and development of agricultural production is also very important feature of the present situation in agriculture .

==== Prior to the war ====
Unlike twenty years ago, is now in agricultural production there is no fundamental cultural production, production that would be meaningful and possible in a larger area of the municipality. For many years it was tobacco. Together with the war has fallen down and the existing state system and thus the former system of organization of agricultural production. In the entire period since then until today, the new system was established.

It is the whole country, especially the area where the municipality brought uncontrolled import all kinds of things. So the majority of agricultural products has become cheaper to import than produce.

The result has already been mentioned drastically reducing obrađivanih area, reducing the number of cattle and even up to five times, the entire reduction in volume of agricultural production. Finally it came to life the feeling that it is impossible to engage in agricultural production as the production activity of which can be live or something and make money.

==== After the war ====
The municipality&#x27;s overall economic performance is stronger than that of the surrounding municipalities - primarily in the Entrepreneurial Sector, and the time orientation and working-age population by non-sector higher. Therefore, the percentage of uncultivated land is the largest in the municipality in comparison to the surrounding ones- 60% (Posušje 59%, 49% Ljubuški and Grude 47%). The number of residents who are engaged solely in agriculture is relatively smallest in Siroki Brijeg.

==Industry==
In the area of industrial production in the municipality are significantly represented meat industry and metal industry, and to a smaller production of footwear, manufacture of construction products and stone processing, production of insulation materials, graphic activity, etc.

Official statistics, which regularly publishes the Federal Bureau of Statistics tracked the movement of industrial production at the level of the Federation and cantons, so that these (official) data for the municipality does not have. However, the basic features of industrial production in this region in the West would be essentially similar and reflect the movement of industrial production for the municipality of Siroki Brijeg.

In the period 2004/2005 the recorded slight growth of the index of industrial production (101.3). When the production of metals and production of metal products recorded a significant growth (index 2005./2004. = 134.3 and 180.4), production of paper products (index = 110.7), while other areas of industrial production recorded a significant decrease ( such as food and beverages: Index = 80.0, mining: index = 71.4).

For further growth of industrial production are essential investments in the development of existing industrial capacity in the areas that are currently represented in the municipality and which employ a large number of workers. This primarily refers to the production of metals and metal products. These activities according to official statistics reported a continued growth during 2005 year. The establishment and construction of new or expansion of existing business and industrial zones is prerequisite for the growth of manufacturing sector, attract domestic and foreign capital and create new jobs.

<text>NEC Nijmegen (&quot;Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie&quot;), commonly known as NEC (), is a professional Dutch association football club based in Nijmegen. The club currently competes in the Eredivisie, the top tier of Dutch football, following promotion from the 2020–21 Eerste Divisie.

The club has reached the final of the KNVB Cup on five occasions – in 1973, 1983, 1994, 2000 and 2024 – and has never won the cup.

==History==
=== 1900–1919: Merger and early years ===
The oldest remnant of NEC Nijmegen, Eendracht, was formed on 15 November 1900 by three men – August Lodenstijn, Antoon Kuypers and Wouter de Lent – representing the people from the &quot;benedenstad&quot; (lower town) who, due to their working class status, were not able to play for the major club in the city, Quick 1888.

Due to a lack of funds, Eendracht initially played only friendly matches against teams from other parts of the city until 1903, when the local league in Nijmegen was formed. Eendracht was the first champion and was promoted to Gelderland&#x27;s regional league, and two years later the club was promoted to the second tier of Dutch football.

Eendracht merged in April 1910 with NVV Nijmegen, a club formed two years earlier by former members of Quick 1888. The new club was given the name Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie, and played its first match against Amsterdam side DEC, the match ending 0–0.

=== 1920–1939: &quot;Never first-class&quot; ===
After a series of ground moves in the club&#x27;s early years, at the beginning of the 1920s, NEC bought land and moved to a ground at Hazenkampseweg. Finally, the club had a permanent home and the club&#x27;s fanbase began to grow. However, despite a new home and increased membership, on-field success did not follow.

Although NEC won second-tier championships in 1928, 1929, 1931, and 1934, the club did not win promotion after losing consecutive play-off matches. The club was mockingly nicknamed &quot;Nooit eerste classer&quot; (), before being promoted at the fifth attempt in 1936. In 1939, NEC won the first Eastern title and fought for the Dutch title in a playoff competition with four other district champions. NEC came in third place, behind Amsterdam sides Ajax and DWS.

The club moved from Hazenkampseweg in 1942 to the Goffertstadion, located in the Goffertpark on the outskirts of the city, where the club still plays today.

=== 1940–1959: WWII and professional football ===
During the Second World War, little football was played. After liberation, the club&#x27;s pre-war success continued and again became the champion of the East in both 1946 and 1947.

Professional football was introduced in the Netherlands in 1954, and came at the wrong time for NEC. The club was not in a good financial state and not as well established as other clubs. When the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) reorganised the league structure in time for the 1956–57 season, NEC found themselves in the lowest semi-professional division, the Tweede Divisie.

=== 1960–1973: Recovery ===
At the beginning of the 1960s, NEC began to recover from its financial difficulties. A major reason for this was new support from the municipal council who began to see the importance of a professional club like the NEC, and started providing financial support in 1963. The following year, the club was promoted to the second-tier Eerste Divisie again and three years later, reached the top-tier Eredivisie for the first time, finishing tenth in its first season.

The club remained in the top flight for seven seasons in a row, with some games played in front of capacity crowds; season averages of 14,000 spectators were normal. NEC flourished, primarily due to the development of players from their youth setup, including Frans Thijssen and Jan Peters.

=== 1974–2002: Lean years ===
However, a sharp decline soon followed. NEC could not sustain itself with its only major revenue sources being the sale of players and the large subsidy from the Nijmegen council.

Relegation from the top flight came in 1974, and although NEC returned to the top division the following year, the club was heading in a downward trajectory. During the following years, NEC became renowned as a yo-yo club; in little over a decade, they changed leagues six times: relegation in 1983, promotion in 1985, relegation in 1986, promotion in 1989, relegation in 1991, and finally promotion in 1994.

In 1981, the club was given further support from the municipal council, when NEC&#x27;s professional and amateur sides separated. This did not prevent the club&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1987. NEC continued to exist only after 80% of creditors waived their claims.

New chairman Henk van de Water formed a sponsors&#x27; club to raise funds which started to gather momentum. By the mid-1990s, NEC was on the way up again. In 1995, the club clung on to a place in the Eredivisie by the skin of their teeth. In 1998, it surprised many with an eighth-place finish. Its financial situation had improved and attendance numbers rose gradually, up to an average of 10,000 spectators.

====Cup finals====
NEC has reached the final of the KNVB Cup four times. On two occasions NEC were underdogs. Going into the 1973 final, the club was the overwhelming favorite. At Rotterdam&#x27;s De Kuip against NAC Breda, things went completely wrong for the Nijmegen club, with NAC coming away 2–0 winners, amidst claims of infighting and disagreements with the manager.

In 1983, NEC unexpectedly reached the Cup Final despite having been relegated that season. It fell to the league champions Ajax 3–1 – the final goal being scored by Johan Cruyff in his final game for Ajax.

NEC, about to be promoted from the Eerste Divisie surprised many by defeating Ajax 2–1 away from home in the semi-finals of the 1994 competition, coming up against Rotterdam at De Kuip in the final, it fell once more 2–1.

In 2000, the club&#x27;s centenary year, it reached the final for the fourth time. The match against Roda JC would end in disappointment for the 20,000 fans who made the trip; NEC lost the match 2–0.

====NEC in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup====
In 1983, during the darkest period of the club&#x27;s history, the club played a match which many see as a highlight of the club&#x27;s history: a match played in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup against Barcelona, while NEC was little more than a mid-table second-tier team.

In the spring, NEC had lost the cup-final against Ajax and were also relegated. Because the Amsterdam-based side had also been crowned champion of the Eredivisie, NEC qualified for UEFA competition while in the second-tier, something which has only happened once since: Wigan Athletic&#x27;s participation in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League while playing in the Championship.

In the first round of the European tournament, NEC narrowly defeated Norway&#x27;s Brann, 2–1 on aggregate. A few days later, the draw was completed for the second round, which pitted the superstars of Barcelona – with both Bernd Schuster and Diego Maradona – against the small Dutch outfit. Both players were injured for the tie, though there was still excitement for the fans at the Goffertstadion – NEC raced into a 2–0 lead after 44 minutes, with goals from Anton Janssen and Michel Mommertz, though the &quot;Blaugrana&quot; would hit back, winning the game 3–2, and strolled to a 2–0 victory at Camp Nou in the second leg.

=== 2003–2012: NEC in Europe ===
29 May 2003 marked a historic day for NEC. Following a late strike from Jaromír Šimr against RKC Waalwijk, NEC finished fifth in the Eredivisie. For the first time in the club&#x27;s history, NEC qualified for the UEFA Cup through their league position. This led to unprecedented scenes with jubilant fans invading the pitch. Similar scenes occurred in the city centre with over 25,000 people celebrating.
In the 2007–08 Eredivisie season, NEC qualified for European competition again, despite a disappointing first half of the season, when the club found itself in 17th place at the winter break. However, there was a remarkable turnaround. From January, NEC improved their form and finished eighth place in the league. This position secured participation in the UEFA Cup play-offs, which they won, beating Roda JC, Groningen, and NAC Breda. With 31 undefeated matches in a row and with a 6–0 home victory at NAC Breda the highlight of the turnaround, NEC achieved European qualification once again.

The year became even more successful following early rounds of the UEFA Cup. In the first round, the club defeated Dinamo București over two ties. After a 1–0 home win, NEC drew 0–0 in Romania to reach the group stage. They were then drawn against Tottenham Hotspur, Udinese, Spartak Moscow, and Dinamo Zagreb. They started poorly, with defeats to both Dinamo Zagreb and Tottenham Hotspur – meaning they were bottom of the group and almost out of the competition. After a 2–1 victory against Spartak Moscow in Russia with a goal from Lasse Schöne, NEC played their last match in Nijmegen against Udinese. To advance, NEC had to win and hope that other results went their way. Tottenham were trailing at half time, while NEC were being held at 0–0. In the 74th minute, however, Tottenham scored twice to eventually draw 2–2 against Spartak and goals from Collins John and Jhon van Beukering gave NEC a 2–0 victory, and they qualified for the knockout round.

The round of 32 of the UEFA Cup saw NEC drawn against Bundesliga side Hamburger SV. The run ended when the Germans won 3–0 in Nijmegen and 1–0 in Hamburg. NEC supporters were subsequently complimented in Europe by Franz Beckenbauer, who said he had never witnessed such great support from away supporters.

=== 2013–present: Relegations and promotions ===
At the end of the 2013–14 season, NEC prevented automatic relegation by holding Ajax to a 2–2 draw in Amsterdam on the last matchday with a brace from Alireza Jahanbakhsh. However, in the following relegation play-offs, NEC lost 4–1 on aggregate to Eerste Divisie&#x27;s 16th placed Sparta Rotterdam and was relegated to the second tier of Dutch football, ending a 20-year run in the top flight.

They bounced back however at the first attempt after beating Sparta 1–0 on 3 April 2015 to clinch the Eerste Divisie title with six games left. On 28 May 2017, NEC faced relegation again after two years in the Eredivisie after losing 5–1 on aggregate against NAC Breda.

They reached the promotion play-offs in both the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, but lost in the semi-finals on both occasions to FC Emmen and RKC Waalwijk. For the 2019–20 season, the club took the ususual step of appointing three head coaches: Adrie Bogers, Rogier Meijer and Francois Gesthuizen – the club finished in eighth place, which would have granted them a place in the play-offs, but due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, there was no promotion or relegation between Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie.

In May 2021, the club once again achieved promotion to the Eredivisie after beating NAC Breda 2–1 in the final of the promotion/relegation play-offs.

== Stadium ==
In the early years of NEC&#x27;s existence, the club played at various grounds around the city, most notably at Hazenkampseweg.

The club&#x27;s current home, Goffertstadion, was opened in 1939 by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. It had been constructed by thousands of the city&#x27;s unemployed, during a time of compulsory employment. At the time of its completion it was the third highest capacity stadium in the Netherlands, after Ajax&#x27;s Olympic Stadium and De Kuip in Rotterdam.

The Gofferstadion was a project by the municipal council, but upon completion both local clubs Quick 1888 and NEC refused to play there, as both had their own stadiums and did not want to pay rent for De Goffert. It therefore took until 1942 for the first match to be played, after NEC&#x27;s home ground was damaged during the Second World War and the club permanently moved to the Goffert.

In 1992 the club purchased the stadium from the municipal council for the symbolic sum of 1 guilder. The stadium was renovated in the late 1990s, with an increased capacity of 12,500, opening with a friendly match between NEC and RSC Anderlecht, which the home side won 3–1.

On 17 October 2021, the away stand collapsed after a match between NEC and rivals Vitesse. Nobody was seriously injured.

=== International matches ===
Goffertstadion has hosted various senior men&#x27;s international matches.
== Kit and colours ==

=== Club colours ===
Upon the merger of NVV and Eendracht, the club played in black shirts with a green and red band across the chest. However the club&#x27;s traditional shirt is known as the &quot;Balkenshirt&quot;, consisting of a red shirt with a green chestband with black trim. During the 2000s, other variations of the club&#x27;s colours were worn, such as a quartered design in 2004–05 and various half-and-half designs. In 2016 NEC&#x27;s board allowed a controversial fan vote on whether to restore the classic chest band, which passed with a slim majority.

== Club culture ==

===Rivalries===
Vitesse are NEC&#x27;s archrivals. The two clubs share a long history together and they contest the Gelderse Derby (Derby of Gelderland), a confrontation between the two largest cities of the province of Gelderland, Arnhem and Nijmegen, two cities with major differences in attitude and culture. Since 1813, Arnhem has been the capital of Gelderland and is historically based on finance and trade, perceived as an office city with modern buildings. Nijmegen, on the other hand, is predominantly a workers&#x27; city, with middle and high-income groups in the minority.

The two cities are just 24 kilometers apart, resulting in an intense crosstown rivalry. The meeting between the two teams is still considered to be one of the biggest matches of the season.

De Graafschap are also considered a rival, and games between them are known as the &quot;Kleine Gelderse Derby&quot; (Little Gelderland Derby) but these matches are not as loaded with the tension and rivalry of those with Vitesse.



=== Mascot ===
Since 2007, the club&#x27;s mascot has been Bikkel, a Roman legionary, with a sword and shield, a reference to the Roman history of the city of Nijmegen. The name Bikkel reportedly refers to the nickname given to former player and coach Ron de Groot, who spent his whole career at the club.

<text>The Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine lies a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, on Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades, California. It was founded and dedicated by Paramahansa Yogananda, on August 20, 1950, and is owned by the Self-Realization Fellowship. The site has lush gardens, a large spring-fed lake framed by hillsides, and a variety of flora and fauna, swans, ducks, koi, turtles, and lotus flowers. The property is situated in a landscape shaped like an amphitheater. Thousands of visitors come each year.

==Overview==

The visitor center provides information about Lake Shrine. There are waterfalls, fountains, flower beds, statues, white swans across the lake, lacy fern grottos, lily ponds, and a Dutch windmill which is used as a chapel. The Court of Religions, honoring five principal religions of the world, displays the symbols of these religions: a cross for Christianity, a Star of David for Judaism, a Wheel of Law for Buddhism, a crescent moon and star for Islam, and the Om symbol for Hinduism. Yogananda believed in an underlying harmony of all faiths that unites us all. Along with a few statues of Krishna and other Hindu deities, there is also a life-size statue of Jesus Christ, above the waterfall, as well as Francis of Assisi and the Madonna and Child.

The golden lotus archway, a towering, sleek, white arch trimmed with blue tile, and topped with gold lotus blossoms, is visible from all parts of the grounds. The archway frames the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial, an outdoor shrine where an authentic 1,000-year-old Chinese stone sarcophagus holds a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi.

The gardens are filled with little brick paths and short stairways which lead from the main trail to hidden alcoves where meditation or sitting and taking in the view is possible. The gift shop features arts and crafts from India which is adjacent to a museum focusing on Paramahansa Yogananda, the founder of Lake Shrine. There is a Dutch windmill converted into a chapel, a houseboat, a bookstore and a temple overlooking the lake.

==History==
The site of the present day Lake Shrine was once part of a parcel of land in the Santa Ynez Canyon, called Bison Ranch. After an initial daily lease arrangement, it was purchased by the silent film producer and director Thomas H. Ince in 1912 to serve as his studio that was developed into an expansive network of sets. Originally known as the Miller 101 Bison Ranch studio, it was subsequently named Inceville, and then Triangle Ranch. After Ince founded his new Triangle/Ince Studios in Culver City in 1915, the site was taken over the following year by director William S. Hart and eventually renamed Hartville. On January 16, 1916, a fire broke out at the Inceville studio; portentously, the first of numerous that eventually claimed all of the timber frame buildings onsite. In 1920, Hart sold the property to the Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation when it was renamed as R.C. Ranch, and where filming continued until a blaze destroyed all of the remaining structures (except for an old church that was made of stone) on July 4, 1922.
For a period of time hence, the property was used as a sand, rock, and gravel quarry before it was later purchased by Los Angeles real-estate magnate Alphonzo Bell Sr. In 1927, the surrounding hillsides were hydraulically graded to fill the canyon, with the intention to completely level it for future development. However, the earth-moving project was never completed, which left a large basin in an unleveled portion of the canyon that subsequently filled to a depth of with water from four (hot and cold) springs within the vicinity. The became known as Lake Santa Ynez; the only spring-fed lake within the City of Los Angeles.

The property remained undeveloped for more than a decade, when the lake was used as a local swimming hole and cattails and reeds grew to screen most of it from view. Although much of the local citizenry considered the area to be valueless swampland, the property was nevertheless purchased by H. Everett &quot;Big Mac&quot; McElroy (the assistant superintendent of construction at 20th Century Studio) in 1940, when it was again used as a film set. McElroy later reflected on his initial vision of his purchase:

The lake was subsequently dredged, and the weeds were cleared away. During his ownership, McElroy and his wife lived in three homes: their two-story Mississippi-styled houseboat (&quot;Adeline&quot;) transported from Lake Mead, a mill house McElroy constructed (which today serves as the gift shop and museum) equipped with a 2.5 ton water wheel used for onsite irrigation from captured lake overflow, and a replica of a sixteenth-century Dutch windmill he built, which later served as the first chapel of the Lake Shrine. The windmill, though functional, was never used. After the McElroys had moved into the mill house, they rented out the houseboat to film stars, movie-industry people, and on occasion to unnamed royalty. At some point, a Chinese Junk had been brought to the site and moored on the eastern shore.
In 1948, McElroy and his wife sold the property to Rene Williams and Joseph M. Gross (an oil company executive) for a reported price exceeding $250,000. Gross and his wife moved into the windmill and made plans to redevelop the site into a resort that included a rambling $2.3 million, 150-room hotel to be constructed around the contour of Lake Santa Ynez. However, one evening Mr. Gross purportedly had a dream reoccur three times, where in the middle of the lake there was a platform adorned with a podium. Here ministers from the &quot;churches of all religions&quot; addressed thousands of attendees with inspirational speeches. When Mr. Gross awoke, he looked up the name &quot;Church of All Religions&quot; in the telephone directory and found the listing for the &quot;Self-Realization Fellowship Church of All Religions&quot; located in Hollywood. Inspired by this coincidence, Gross immediately composed a letter to go out in the next day&#x27;s mail, which described his dream and included an offer to sell his property.

Rather than await a response, on the following day, Gross telephoned the church headquarters and was transferred to Paramahansa Yogananda who mysteriously initiated the conversation before the caller could even introduce himself or state his business: &quot;You have some property for sale, don&#x27;t you? When can I see it?&quot;, inquired Sri Yogananda. &quot;But you haven&#x27;t received my letter,&quot; replied Mr. Gross. &quot;The letter will come tomorrow morning. Can we meet tomorrow afternoon?&quot;, responded Sri Yogananda. The next day, he visited the site and immediately planned for the establishment of an open-air shrine of all religions. With the support of several benefactors, Paramahansa Yogananda acquired the property in 1949 and constructed a temple, meditation garden, the Mahatma Gandhi peace memorial, and the newly replaced landing (2023).

During the months of improvement, Sri Yogananda commuted from the Mount Washington hermitage (whilst spending at least several nights in the houseboat) to supervise the project with a vision to create an environment that would reflect all aspects of God with peace, beauty, and harmony; and also invoked a blessing upon all of the future visitors to the Lake Shrine. A public dedication of the Lake Shrine took place on August 20, 1950. The keynote speaker was the then Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight who addressed some 1,500 attendees, including a number of other foreign dignitaries. Within the first eight months of its opening, ten thousand people had visited the site.

Sri Yogananda had remarked that the location reminded him of Kashmir, and had described within the &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; some of the landscaped features and flora cultivated onsite:

On March 6, 1952, the day before his passing, Paramahansa Yogananda and a group of monks participated in what was to become known as the Guru&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;, where for over an hour Sri Yogananda chanted &quot;Light the Lamp of Thy Love&quot; while playing the organ.

A number of improvements have occurred on the property in the ensuing years, including: the construction of the main temple upon the southern bluff overlooking the lake (in 1996), construction of the monastics&#x27; ashram and retreat (1997), the purchase of the adjoining Santa Ynez Transcendental Meditation (TM) property (1998), the addition of a steel structure and copper roof over the Gandhi peace memorial (2002), the renovation of the Lake Shrine Court of Religions, entrance gate (2003), and the houseboat (2007); the restoration of the Windmill Chapel (2015), and the newly replacement landing (2023).

The property was surrounded by flames during the 2025 Palisades Fire; one family defended the Lake Shrine for four days, and though there was some damage, most of the facilities were unharmed due to their efforts.

==Features==
===Gandhi Shrine===

The Lake Shrine is home for the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial. Originally designed by Paramahansa Yogananda as a &quot;wall-less temple&quot;, it was erected in honor of Mahatma Gandhi, the architect of India&#x27;s freedom through nonviolent means. Along the southern lakeshore, surrounding a semicircular portion of the memorial area stands the golden lotus archway, which is crowned at the center with a massive ellipsoidal pinnacle that is flanked by two large lotuses (with two additional smaller ellipsoidal fixtures on the outermost edges atop the structure); each constructed of copper coated with a golden varnish. The focal point of the memorial is a thousand-year-old stone sarcophagus from China, in which a portion of Gandhi&#x27;s ashes are encased in a brass and silver coffer. The sarcophagus is flanked by two statues of Guanyin.

The ashes had been sent to Yogananda by an old friend, Dr. V.M. Nawle, a publisher and journalist from Pune, India. Following the dedication of the memorial, Dr. Nawle wrote:
For some, enshrining Gandhi&#x27;s ashes at the Lake Shrine is controversial since the Hindu cremation ritual ends with immersion of the ashes in water. One report states that Gandhi&#x27;s relatives want the ashes at Lake Shrine to be immersed in water. Another report states that the descendants of Mahatma Gandhi do not want to have the ashes removed because it would entail breaking the shrines.

===Windmill Chapel===
The previous owners, the McElroys, built an authentic reproduction of a 16th-century Dutch windmill. Though the mill was never put to use, its sails are functional and capable of turning in the wind. Then came a boat dock and landing, whose peaked roof, carved figure-heads, and benches added yet another charming touch to the unusual setting. Yogananda converted the windmill into a chapel where meditations and services were held. Until the new temple was constructed in 1996, the windmill chapel was the primary location for all services held at the Lake Shrine. During the interim years, it had been enlarged once during the 1950s, and again later to accommodate the ever increasing attendance.

Due to the erosion caused by the elements, termites, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the chapel was closed to the public in 2013. Cost overruns delayed the completion of the Windmill Chapel for another year. During an exploratory demolition process, it was discovered that the windmill tower was not well-connected to the lower structure, making it unreliable for withstanding earthquakes. The scope of the restoration work therefore evolved into a major engineering project. Throughout the nearly two year-long restoration process, both the interior and exterior appearance of the building were diligently preserved to match its original form. Along with the architects, engineers, and other professional tradespeople, SRF monks with carpentry skills and construction experience participated in the project, which was entirely funded through donations from devotees.

To remedy the structural deficiency, two long steel beams were installed to anchor the octagonal tower to the masonry of the outer walls, thus dispersing the load upon the lower structure. About six years prior to the windmill restoration project, SRF staff had purchased some rare old growth redwood beams that were salvaged in Mendocino County. This wood was used to build the long windmill replacement veins, the fascia, and other exterior elements. Due to the high presence of tannin that built up within the wood over the course of some four-hundred years, it is considered to be highly resilient to weathering and termite incursion, and is estimated to last in the hundreds of years.

Further improvements included: the replacement or repair of all of the roofs; installation of additional hidden steel structural reinforcement to help prevent earthquake damage; and the precise re-creation of the original windmill sails, window casings, the skylight, and other elements of the building&#x27;s extensive customized woodwork. The tiles covering the windmill tower were removed, numbered, and reinstalled in their original order after repairs were made to its frame. Additional upgrades were made to the furnace, gas lines, the access for the disabled, retaining walls, the surrounding landscaping; and the electrical, security, audio, and fire alarm systems. The reopening of the chapel took place on July 27, 2015, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony officiated by Brother Achalananda, preceded by an introduction by Brother Vishwananda.

===Lake, waterfalls and animal life===
Averaging a depth of , Lake Santa Ynez is fed by two waterfalls; one that falls approximately , and another series-waterfall, that falls approximately .

Yogananda (Paramahansa means &quot;supreme&quot; or &quot;highest swan&quot;) encouraged swans to live on the Lake Shrine. Their large nests can be seen in this locale. Brother Anandamoy said in the recording, &quot;Is Peace Possible in Today&#x27;s World&quot; that when he was a minister at the Lake Shrine, they had three pairs of swans: one white, one black, and one white with a black neck. The lake was big enough for everybody, but the swans fought, fighting for the kill. They had to be separated, by dividing the lake into three sections. Anandamoy continues saying that swans are like people and as long as one party wants the &quot;whole cake&quot; there will be war. If people follow the laws of God, overcome selfishness and consider the welfare of everyone, we will have peace eventually.

==In popular culture==
Elvis Presley loved the shrine. According to his friend, Jerry Schilling, he walked around the lake and picked up some brochures, and later sent away for information about Eastern philosophy. Elvis developed a 12-year relationship with Sri Daya Mata, the woman who was then the president of the Self-Realization Fellowship, and would often call her for advice when he was troubled.
George Harrison&#x27;s funeral was held at the Lake Shrine. Anne-Marie O&#x27;Connor of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;After the death of George Harrison, one of the most high-profile members of the Self-Realization Fellowship, his family and friends gathered at the Lake Shrine&#x27;s small Windmill Chapel for his funeral. Ravi Shankar was there with his wife.&quot;

Singer-songwriter Judee Sill (1944–1979) was given a service here by her friends in 1979 following her death from an overdose in November 1979. Her ashes were then scattered on the Pacific Ocean.

The memorial service for Lux Interior, lead singer of the Cramps, was held on February 21, 2009, at the Windmill Chapel.

Dennis Weaver was a member of the Self-Realization Fellowship and spoke once a month at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine for seventeen years, while Gerry, his wife, played the organ. He said, &quot;We called it our &#x27;mom and pop&#x27; church and it was one of my great blessings. It was life-changing.&quot;

The actress Linda Evans was invited by Dennis Weaver, when she was doing a guest appearance on &quot;McCloud&quot;, to the SRF Lake Shrine, to hear one of his monthly Sunday sermons. Weaver gave her the &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, saying that it changed his life. Linda wrote, &quot;Because of Dennis I took the first step in what would become a lifelong spiritual journey. After years studying the Self-Realization Fellowship at Malibu, I went on to learn from books and other teachers&quot;.

Tom Petty&#x27;s memorial was held at the Lake Shrine in October 2017.

Jazz singer and actor Herb Jeffries&#x27;s memorial service was held at the Lake Shrine on July 12, 2014. Paramahansa Yogananda was Jeffries&#x27; guru. Jeffries was internationally known for performing with Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines. He was also recognized as &quot;The Bronze Buckaroo&quot;, the first African-American to take a lead role in westerns.

<doc id="834193" wikidata="Q705345" url="?curid=834193" title="List of One Day International cricket records">
<text>One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top four Associate members. Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings – although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI matches are a subset of List A cricket.

The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been more than 4,700 ODIs played by 29 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased, partly because of the increase in the number of ODI-playing countries, and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue with the increased popularity of cricket, a process that dates from the time of the Packer Revolution. In February 2022, in their home series against the West Indies, India played their 1,000th ODI match, becoming the first team to play one thousand matches in this format.

The trend of countries to increase the number of ODI matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players, though this trend is reversing as teams play more Twenty20 Internationals. Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in ODIs with a total of 18,426. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is the highest ODI wicket-taker with a total of 534 wickets. The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene.
==Listing criteria==
In general the top five are listed in each category (except when there is a tie for the last place among the five, in which case all the tied record holders are noted).

==Listing notation==
Team notation
* (300–3) indicates that a team scored 300 runs for three wickets and the innings was closed, either due to a successful run chase or if no overs remained (or are able) to be bowled.
* (300) indicates that a team scored 300 runs and was all out, either by losing all ten wickets or by having one or more batsmen unable to bat and losing the remaining wickets.

;Batting notation
* (100*) indicates that a batsman scored 100 runs and was not out.
* (175) indicates that a batsman scored 175 runs and was out after that.

;Bowling notation
* (5–40) indicates that a bowler has captured 5 wickets while giving away 40 runs.
* (49.5 overs) indicates that a team bowled 49 complete overs (each of six legal deliveries), and one incomplete over of just five deliveries.

;Active players

* Currently active ODI players appear in boldface.
* Currently active ODI officials are shown by ‡.

Seasons
* Cricket is played during the summer months in most countries. Domestic cricket seasons in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and the West Indies may therefore span two calendar years, and are by convention said to be played in (&quot;e.g.&quot;) &quot;2008–09&quot;. A cricket season in England is described as a single year. &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;2009&quot;. An international ODI series or tournament may be for a much shorter duration, and Cricinfo treats this issue by stating &quot;as a rule of thumb, any series or tour or tournament which began between the six months of April and September of any given year will appear in the relevant single year season and any that began between October and March will appear in the relevant cross-year season&quot;. In the record tables, a two-year span generally indicates that the record was set within a domestic season in one of the above named countries.

<doc id="834195" wikidata="Q3040721" url="?curid=834195" title="Duke of Saint-Cloud">
<text>The title of Duke of Saint-Cloud was created in 1674. The intention behind the creation was to provide a noble title to be held by the Archbishop of Paris for the time being.

The Bishop of Paris had only received the title Archbishop in relatively recent times, on October 20, 1622, so as to recognize the emergence of Paris as the royal capital. It was common enough in France for a number of bishoprics to be joined automatically to a noble title. There were, for example, the Bishop-Count of Beauvais, the Bishop-Count of Châlons and the Bishop-Count of Noyon.

In this way, the incumbents of three ancient bishoprics in the kingdom had along with the title of the ecclesiastical see also the secular noble title of Duke and peer of France, the latter being a particularly high distinction for a restricted circle of the nobility.

The three cases prior to 1674 were the Archbishop of Rheims and the Bishops of Laon and Langres. To these was added, then, the case of the archbishopric of Paris. In the existing cases, the title of the dukedom was the same as the bishopric. Presumably in the case of Paris, it seemed inappropriate for the bishop of the royal capital be &quot;Duke of Paris&quot; and so the dukedom or duchy created was given an alternative name.

So it was that in 1674 the domain and lordships of Saint-Cloud, Maisons-Alfort, Créteil, Ozoir-la-Ferrière, and Armentières-en-Brie were erected into a duchy of Saint-Cloud, although the title was not registered in the parlement until 1690. The first to bear the title was François de Harlay de Champvalon, who had been Archbishop since 1671. It was then held by his successors at Paris till the Revolution.

These four dukedoms, not being hereditary, did not become extinct on the death of the holder, but were assumed by the legitimate successor to the bishopric.

However, all four dukedoms or duchies, along with the entire Peerage of France, were abolished during the French Revolution, on August 4, 1789, the Night of the Abolition of Feudalism.

<doc id="834196" wikidata="Q24719" url="?curid=834196" title="Roda JC Kerkrade">
<text>Sportvereniging Roda Juliana Combinatie Kerkrade (; ), shortly as Roda JC Kerkrade () or commonly Roda JC or simply Roda, is a Dutch professional football club based in Kerkrade, Netherlands. Roda JC Kerkrade plays in the Eerste Divisie. The club was founded by a merger between Rapid JC and Roda Sport in 1962. They were placed in the Eerste Divisie, and after a relegation they were promoted back to the top division in 1973, where they would stay for 41 years until being relegated in 2014. In 2009–10, they added &quot;Kerkrade&quot; to the name to create brand awareness and get financial support.

Roda JC is known as the &quot;coal-miner&#x27;s club&quot;; fans of archrival club MVV, from the provincial capital of Maastricht, say those words condescendingly. However, in Kerkrade and the surrounding area, they are said with pride and respect, although the last Dutch coal mines were closed in the 1970s.

Roda JC&#x27;s club honours include seven European campaigns and six KNVB Cup finals, of which they won two. One of its predecessors in club&#x27;s &quot;family tree&quot; of mergers, Rapid JC, were champions of the Netherlands in 1956. Ten out of eleven players on that Rapid JC team were coal miners.

==History==
===Merge (1955–1962)===
Roda JC Kerkrade came into being as the result of a merger of several football clubs from Kerkrade. In 1954, SV Kerkrade (established 1926) and SV Bleijerheide (1914) merged to form Roda Sport. That same year, Rapid &#x27;54 (1954) and amateur club Juliana (1910) merged to form Rapid JC. Rapid JC was one of the most successful clubs of that time, winning the Championship play-off in 1956. In later years they would only finish in the top 10 once, when they finished second in the 1958–59 season. Roda Sport, however, were relegated to the Tweede Divisie and stayed there until the latest merger with Rapid JC, to form Roda JC.

===Struggling and staying at the top division (1963–94)===
After the merger they began in the Eerste Divisie in the 1962–63 season, but were relegated the same season after finishing 16th. The following season they almost achieved promotion again, but they lost in the play-off and remained in the Tweede Divisie for eight years. After their return to the Eerste Divisie, it only took a further two seasons before they were promoted to the Eredivisie, when they finished first.

The club are finally in the premier division, but did not manage to qualify for a European competition even though they finished near the top several times. They only qualified for Europe once when they lost in the finals of the KNVB Cup in 1975, but they lost in the first round, 5–3 on aggregate, to Anderlecht. In the 1986–87 season they finally finished high enough for the UEFA Cup play-offs in the Netherlands, but lost their place to Utrecht. One year later they finished 15th and struggled to avoid relegation to the Eerste Divisie. They did, however, reach the finals of the KNVB Cup. Since PSV already had a place in Europe by winning the Eredivisie, Roda JC also earned a place in the European Cup. With the financial backing of entrepreneur Nol Hendriks, this was the club&#x27;s most memorable European campaign, when Roda made it through the winter in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup before succumbing to the superb strikers of Bulgarian Sredets Sofia, Hristo Stoichkov, Lyuboslav Penev and Emil Kostadinov, who became superstars in Europe&#x27;s major football leagues. Two years later, they finished fifth twice, but only once gained a place in a European competition. They did well in the KNVB Cup in 1990–91, reaching the semi-finals, and a year later reached the finals.

===Dutch and European success (1994–2002)===
Since 1994, the club has managed to achieve several successes both in Europe and the Netherlands during the Nol Hendriks era. Most notable was their second-place finish in the Eredivisie in 1994–95. They also won the KNVB Cup twice, in 1996–97 and 1999–2000. As a result of these successes, they qualified for several European competitions. In the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Roda was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Vicenza 1–9 on aggregate. Roda&#x27;s most memorable European match was played on 28 February 2002. After a 0–1 defeat at the hands of Milan in Kerkrade, Roda caused panic at San Siro by winning the return leg by the same score (0–1). The only goal scored during this match was made by Mark Luijpers. Roda even took the lead in the penalty shoot-out, but ended up losing the series, only being one penalty away from eliminating Milan.

Since then, Roda have only qualified twice for the UEFA Intertoto Cup, in 2003–04 and 2004–05. In later years, they did manage to qualify for the play-offs but never won it.

Roda&#x27;s position in Dutch football is best illustrated by their history in the KNVB Cup. Roda were good enough to make it to six finals, but the first three times and the last time the opponent in the final was one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; – and Roda went home with the silver medal: PSV won in 1976 and 1988 and Feyenoord in 1992 and 2008. However, in two of the club&#x27;s cup finals, a non-Big Three side was the opponent. Both times, the cup went to Kerkrade: Heerenveen were defeated in 1997 and NEC in 2000.

===Decline (2002–2013)===
Since 1992, Roda have been in discussions with neighbours Fortuna Sittard, as well as MVV and VVV, with a view to merging to form a new club, named FC Limburg. A statement of intent was published by Roda and Fortuna in November 2008 and in early 2009 financial backing was found for the scheme. All these attempts, however, floundered.

In 2008, the club gained its final notable success by reaching the KNVB Cup final. In the final, opponent and home side Feyenoord proved to be too strong, winning 2–0. One year later, the two teams met again in De Kuip for the final round of the 2008–09 Eredivisie season. Roda JC needed a win to avoid direct relegation, and against all odds, Roda JC defeated Feyenoord to qualify for the promotion/relegation play-offs. Roda eventually won the play-offs, defeating Cambuur in a penalty shoot-out.

In 2010, the club added &quot;Kerkrade&quot; to its name, so the new full name of the sports club is now Roda JC Kerkrade. This was one of the conditions set by the municipality of Kerkrade, in return for their sponsorship.

Roda JC finished in 16th position in the 2012–13 Eredivisie season and were therefore again forced to participate in the play-offs. &quot;The Coal Miners&quot; came out victorious again after a late free-kick winner by Mark-Jan Fledderus against Sparta Rotterdam, extending the club&#x27;s stay at the highest level for another season.

===Relegations, Eerste Divisie and turmoil (2014–2019)===
Roda JC finished 18th in the 2013–14 Eredivisie and were relegated in May 2014, ending a 41-year period of football at the highest national level. However, they bounced back from the Eerste Divisie on their first attempt after defeating NAC after extra time in a promotion/relegation play-off final.

In January 2017, Dubai-based Swiss-Russian businessman Aleksei Korotaev took a minority interest in the club and brought former French international Nicolas Anelka with him in an advisory role. After Korotaev was jailed for alleged fraud in Dubai later that year, Anelka dropped his involvement with the club.

The club was relegated for a second time in their history in May 2018, after finishing the season in 16th place and subsequently losing 2–1 on aggregate to Eerste Divisie side Almere City in the promotion and relegation play-offs.

The following seasons were marked by ups and downs in the second tier, finishing as low as 17th in the abandoned 2019–20 season, and as high as the fifth in the 2021–22 season, where they were, however, knocked out by Excelsior 4–2 on aggregate in the playoffs. The club also went through turmoil behind the scenes, and had been close bankruptcy several times in the late 2010s.

In May 2019, Mexican investor Mauricio García de la Vega became involved in the club, acquiring 25% of the shares. However, the club faced consequences for not disclosing this to the licensing commission beforehand, receiving a three-point deduction from the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) in December 2019. García de la Vega&#x27;s presence led to significant tensions within the organisation, as it later emerged that he had threatened several staff members.

The situation reached a climax on 27 September 2019, when angry fans chased him out of the stadium. Following this, on 5 October 2019, Roda JC announced that García de la Vega had withdrawn his investment and departed from the club. Instead, a consortium of local investors assumed control of 80% of the club shares (with Korotaev retaining 20%) and pledged to cover the club&#x27;s €900,000 debt. The KNVB approved the plan in January 2020, effectively rendering the club debt-free.

===Stabilisation (2020–present)===
In September 2020, the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) greenlit the acquisition of Roda JC, transferring ownership to the Roda JC Foundation. Spearheaded by a local consortium comprising entrepreneurs Stijn Koster, Bert Peels, Roger Hodenius, and investment firm Mercurius, the proposal emerged in May 2020 with the goal of propelling the club to the summit of the Eerste Divisie. Operating under the moniker Phoenix Group, they committed to injecting €1.5 million annually over the next three seasons, bracing for potential budget shortfalls. Simultaneously, they petitioned the Kerkrade municipality to slash Parkstad Limburg Stadion&#x27;s rent to €250,000. The KNVB&#x27;s nod signaled the official departure of principal shareholder Frits Schrouff, who had been at the helm since 2015.

Following successful on-field performances, securing playoff spots in 2021 and 2022, Roda JC faced a downturn in the 2022–23 season, finishing in 15th place. In response, the club appointed former Roda JC player Bas Sibum, then assistant coach at FC Emmen, as their new head coach for the 2023–24 season. Under his leadership, the team experienced a significant turnaround in results, propelling them into contention for promotion. On 3 May 2024, Roda JC fans prematurely celebrated their team&#x27;s promotion to the Eredivisie after a 2–0 victory over Cambuur, believing they had secured a top-two finish. However, a 95th-minute equalizer by their direct rivals, Groningen, against Telstar denied Roda&#x27;s promotion, extending the race to the final matchday. The stadium announcer had mistakenly announced their promotion due to a poor internet connection, leading Roda&#x27;s supporters to invade the pitch at Parkstad Limburg Stadion. The premature pitch invasion made international news. On the final matchday, Roda lost a direct matchup to Groningen, meaning they had to compete in the playoffs for promotion. In the first round of the playoffs, Roda lost 8–1 on aggregate to NAC Breda, extending their stay in the second tier.

==Stadium==
After the establishment of the club, Roda JC Kerkrade played in Sportpark Kaalheide with a capacity of 21,500 spectators. Its current stadium is the Parkstad Limburg Stadion, an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 19,979. It was opened on 15 August 2000 with a match against Spanish side Real Zaragoza, which ended in a 2–2 draw.

==Honours==
Before their merger, Rapid JC had won the top league title once, in the 1955–56 season.

==Coaches==
==Sponsors==
==Supporters==

Although not the most vocal, the supporters of Roda JC are generally considered to be among the most loyal and well behaved in the Netherlands. In the early days of the club, Kaalheide was the club&#x27;s home ground. Initially, supporters could roam free over the terraces. However, in the 1970s, fences were placed between the various sections, preventing supporters to move from one stand to the other. The fanatical supporters decided to unite at the covered north side stand, creating an old fashioned, atmospheric stand. Kaalheide became an infamous stadium for visiting teams.

Since moving to the Parkstad Limburg Stadium in the summer of 2000, the more fanatical supporters can be found behind the goal on the West side. The West Stand was renamed &#x27;Koempel Tribune&#x27; (Miner Stand) in September 2014 to honour the fans who remained loyal to the club after the relegation four months earlier.

Since 1989, there is a close friendship between the supporters of TSV Alemannia Aachen and Roda JC Kerkrade. Fans of both clubs regularly visit each other&#x27;s games. The clubs have the tradition to play a preparation match for the coming season, each and every year. It is not uncommon that fans from both clubs get together, march towards the stadium as one group, and walk into a stand as one. They cheer and clap for every goal.

==Rivalries==
Roda JC has three provincial rivals, namely Fortuna Sittard, MVV and VVV-Venlo. The arch rival is MVV, the team from the provincial capital of Maastricht. The Roda JC-MVV rivalry is considered to be the number one rivalry in the province of Limburg by both sets of supporters.

During the 1990s, the rivalry between Roda JC and Fortuna Sittard intensified, as both clubs were relatively successful during that period. Fanatical supporters of both clubs have clashed regularly ever since. This increased rivalry also created animosity between hooligans of Roda JC and the Belgian Limburg club K.R.C. Genk, stemming from the friendship between Fortuna Sittard and K.R.C. Genk.

Due to the distance between Kerkrade and Venlo, the rivalry with VVV-Venlo is considered to be a minor one by the majority of the Roda JC supporters.
