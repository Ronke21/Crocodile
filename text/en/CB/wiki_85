<text>Weapon focus is the concentration on a weapon by a witness of a crime and the subsequent inability to accurately remember other details of the crime. Weapon focus is a factor that heavily affects the reliability of eyewitness testimony. This effect involves a witness to a crime diverting his or her attention to the weapon the perpetrator is holding, thus causing memory impairments and leaving less attention for other details in the scene, such as the attacker’s face, clothing or vehicle.

Several studies support the notion of weapon focus, particularly in terms of greater attention paid to the weapon and its effects on recognition and recall. Elizabeth Loftus, Yuille and Burns have all been associated with studies showing the existence of a weapon focus effect.

== Background information ==

In the field of forensic psychology, researchers have validated the weapon focus effect and shown that a witness will remember less about a crime, or the perpetrator of a crime, when a weapon is present, as opposed to if the weapon is not present at an identical crime. As for the reason of the phenomenon, the two leading explanations attribute it to the cognitive arousal of the witness, or to the overall unusualness of the situation.

In one of the earliest known investigations of weapon focus, Johnson and Scott (1976) had two groups of participants come into what they thought was a laboratory study of human memory. In actuality, they were to take part in a simulated interaction intended to determine whether the presence of a weapon would influence eyewitness memory for an event. Participants in the control condition sat in a waiting room where they overheard a conversation between two people following which a man exited with greasy hands and a grease pen. In the weapon condition, participants sat in the same waiting room, but instead they heard a violent argument – including furniture being thrown around – following which a man came out holding a blood-stained knife. During a photo line-up, the control participants were more likely to accurately identify the man they saw in the waiting room relative to participants in the weapon condition (49% versus 33% correct identifications).

In 1979, initially Loftus postulated that it is an expected occurrence in the event where an individual is highly aroused, such as in the case of a frightening situation. This suggestion was criticized for its lack of supporting evidence, so its author conducted several studies in 1987 and finally demonstrated the viability of weapon focus. The study conducted by Johnson and Scott (1976) represents one of the few early simulation studies available, likely due to the ethical issues surrounding the exposure of research participants to a putatively threatening scenario. For this reason much of the research conducted on the weapon focus effect has made use of videos or slideshows. In one of the first such experiments, Loftus, Loftus and Messo (1987) had participants watch a video in which a young man approached the counter of a fast food restaurant, presented an object to the cashier, accepted money and left. In the control condition the man presented a cheque to the cashier whereas in the weapon condition the man presented a gun. Specialized equipment tracked the participant&#x27;s gaze as they viewed the video to determine with what frequency (and for how long) they fixated upon the item of interest (the cheque or the gun). Relative to the control condition, participants in the weapon condition looked at the item the man was holding more frequently and for greater duration. Further, when tested for the details of the event, performance was better for the control condition relative to the weapon condition - with the exception that participants in the weapon condition were more likely to recall what object the man was holding (a gun).

Another significant challenge to the studies on the weapon focus effect has been their ecological validity. Specifically, many theorists have argued that the effect is limited to the laboratory design. These claims have been supported by the relative absence of applied evidence supporting the effect. Several reports have been published looking for evidence of a weapon focus effect using records of actual crimes. According to the laboratory findings summarized above, the prediction had been that eyewitness memory would be worse for weapon crimes compared to non-weapon crimes. Many primary studies have failed to support this prediction. Even so, a recent meta-analysis conducted by Fawcett et al. (2013) has demonstrated that when the data for all of the applied studies are combined, there &quot;is&quot; a small but reliable effect suggesting that weapon presence impairs actual eyewitness memory. This is extremely significant when one considers how jurors tend to overvalue eyewitness testimony. This finding adds to the ecological validity of the laboratory studies conducted on this topic. One reason why this effect&#x27;s ecological validity may be hard to support could be the difficulty in testing this effect on actual eyewitnesses and their memory of a crime.

On the other hand, a study published in 2004 found the opposite when confronted with weapon focus. It found that the exposure to firearms was associated with significantly better eyewitness descriptions especially regarding basic features such as gender, height, build, age, and ethnicity.

==Causes of weapon focus==

A leading explanation for a cause of weapon focus is the unusualness of the situation, being a witness to a crime. Since the initial research conducted by Johnson and Scott (1976) and Loftus et al. (1987), others have demonstrated a similar effect using unusual objects rather than weapons. These findings are described as the &quot;Unusual Item Hypothesis.&quot; This effect is seen when an object does not fit with the schema of the situation. Attention is then drawn to the out-of-place object and less attention is paid to other objects in the scene making recalling these other objects more difficult. This effect was observed in Toronto in 1997 when a robber entered a coffee shop and demanded money while threatening to strangle a goose he was holding if he did not receive the money. Meanwhile, the customers were too focused on the strangeness of a goose in the coffee shop to observe any details about the perpetrator himself. This effect has also been observed in the lab. For example, Pickel (1998) demonstrated an effect comparable to weapon focus using a video in which a man approached a cashier and presented a whole raw chicken or miniature Pillsbury Dough Boy instead of an expected item such as a wallet. From her finding, Pickel (1998) argued that the weapon focus arose from the unusual nature of the object in the relation to the context in which it was presented. Another study by Mansour et. al (2018) presented subjects with a video of a crime scene. From their findings, subjects remembered more about a scene when a crime was committed with a binder, which represented an ordinary object, compared to unusual objects such as a gun or knife. This was also seen in a study done in 2013 which examined weapon focus, and determined whether or not a gun automatically engages visual attention. There were two experiments that were conducted, which included targets that either depicted a gun, or another object. The conclusion of this experiment was that images of a gun did not engage attention more than that of images of other objects, including a tomato and a pocket watch. It was discovered that in order for an object to be viewed as threatening, the environment and context of the situation is of utmost importance. The context of the situation will ultimately determine whether or not weapon focus is existent in an instance of eyewitness testimony. Furthermore, in her article, Kerri L. Pickel determined that the peculiarity of an object is a reason for the weapon focus effect. Being unusual attracts more attention to the weapon, but the object does not necessarily have to be a weapon to produce this effect. This contributes to the idea that the context of the situation has more importance than the actual weapon a victim witnesses. The mere unusual aspect of a situation with a foreign object is enough to elicit the weapon focus response. 

In their 2013 meta-analysis, Fawcett et al. (2013) presented the issues surrounding the arousal/threat hypothesis. This is one of the oldest explanations connected to the weapon focus phenomenon, and relies on the Yerkes-Dodson law that links arousal and performance; emotionally arousing states, such as stress, can enhance performance up to a point, but after this there are detrimental impacts on cognitive functions, like memory and learning. The amygdala, a brain region located near the center of the brain, is responsible for fear processing and emotional response to both negative and positive stimuli. Research by Sander and Grafman has suggested that the amygdala serves to not only process fear-inducing stimuli but also to determine which information is relevant for encoding. This suggests that the amygdala plays a role in determining what to pay attention to during the crime. In situations where a weapon is present, witnesses tend to focus on the object of arousal and miss peripheral details, like the identity of the perpetrator. This explanation relies on Easterbrook&#x27;s (1959) theory that stress causes a reduction in mental resources, thus the range of cues a subject can attend to in this situation will be significantly reduced. In a dangerous situation where a weapon is present, survival becomes the most important facets and peripheral information is overlooked. This means that the witness has a heightened memory for the weapon, but may struggle to recall other information. Over time, research into the role of anxiety on weapon focus has produced inconsistent findings, causing researchers to look at alternative causes of the phenomenon. The relative contributions of both arousal and unusualness remain one of the primary theoretical issues in this literature, with some authors arguing for a contribution of both.

Another potential cause of weapon focus is the &quot;automatic capture&quot; explanation. This suggests that the attention paid to a weapon is automatic and unintentional. Studies have been performed that show that even if a subject is asked to ignore specific stimuli they are unable to, thus indicating an automatic response. Remington et al. (1992) conclude that a participant might intend to ignore an event, but their attention is often automatically captured by it - as such, an eyewitness may not intend to solely focus on a weapon, but if their diversion of attention to it cannot be controlled, they possess little ability to ignore it. Yantis and Jonides (1996) suggest that it makes adaptive sense for humans to divert attention towards new objects, as a new representation has to be created for that object, presenting another explanation for the weapon focus phenomenon. However, they also conclude that attention focus is not automatic and can be directed on command, especially if attention is already focused somewhere specific. If attention is already focused away from a certain stimulus, then automatic capture is avoidable.

== Differences in weapon focus effects ==
Differences in eyewitness memory can be attributed to whether the perpetrator holding a weapon is consistent with the eyewitness&#x27;s schema. People use schemas to organize knowledge and provide a basis for future understanding. Researcher Kerri Pickel posits that if the object held by the target falls in line with the witness&#x27;s schema, they will not divert as much attention to it and the characteristics of the perpetrator will be encoded normally - it is only when the combination of the perpetrator and the object is not consistent with the schema that the weapon focus effect will be significant in distorting memory.

Pickel looked into some differences in the memory of the eyewitnesses, when the physical traits of the perpetrator change. Firstly, the difference in memory was examined between eyewitnesses that saw a white perpetrator versus a black perpetrator. Her research, conducted in 2009, showed that the weapon focus effect weakens with &#x27;black&#x27; perpetrators in comparison to &#x27;white&#x27; perpetrators, and that the weapon focus effect is not significant when a &quot;Black perpetrator wore a style of clothing that is strongly associated with Black men&quot;. It is suggested that individuals who observe a black perpetrator who is armed automatically activates a stereotype that links black men with weapons and crime. As a consequence, this reduces the unusualness of the weapon and increases the likelihood of attracting attention.

In the same year, Pickel also looked at the weapon focus effect on memory for female versus male perpetrators. The experiments involved participants watching videos that either had a male or female perpetrator, holding either a gun or a neutral object. Overall, the weapon focus effect was strongest when the gun was held by a woman as opposed to a male perpetrator. Participants rated the presence of the gun as more unusual when it was held by a woman versus when it was held by a man, less accurately described the physical traits of the perpetrator when they were holding a gun and the overall memory falsities were greater in the conditions where the gun was held by a female. The presence of the gun in the possession of the female perpetrators was more unexpected, thus participants allocated more of their attention to the weapon over their physical traits. Pickel did, however, find that the weapon focus effect was mitigated when participants were primed and the perpetrators were categorized as dangerous and aggressive.

A different effect of weapon focus can be used in a way to reduce change blindness. A study in 2017 aimed to find a way to reduce change blindness by making use of weapon focus. What they found was that the group of subjects that make use of weapon focus was less susceptible to change blindness when the change in the picture was a weapon they focused on. This shows that weapon focus can be used in a less negative way.

== Weapon focus effect on children ==
In light of research recommendations, some more recent research has looked into the individual differences surrounding the weapon focus phenomenon, where not all samples of participants have reacted in the same way to the presence of a weapon, namely children. In some situations, like domestic violence, children can be crucial eyewitnesses, so recent research has looked at the age at which the weapon focus effect becomes influential. One study looked at the impacts of a surprising object on the memory of children, using a syringe filled with red dye in place of a classic weapon. The presence of the syringe caused a reduction in performance on a memory task, suggesting that the children diverted a significant proportion of their attention to the weapon, so that their recall ability was negatively impacted. This implies that the weapon focus effect does not exclusively occur in adults. At a similar time, Pickel et al. (2008) conducted comparable research, which used videos containing either a weapon or neutral object. Again, children recalled significantly less accurate information when a knife was involved as opposed to a water bottle. The researchers attributed this to the unexpected nature of the knife and schema violation. Adults were found to be more accurate in general with their recollection of the perpetrator than children; language abilities, appreciation for the situation and differing locations were all implicated in these asymmetries.

==Reducing weapon focus and its impact on criminal cases==

Pickel, Ross, and Truelove (2006) decided to take a more in depth look at these ideas and apply them specifically to reducing weapon focus. If weapon focus is an automatic process, then the capture of attention may be out of an eyewitness&#x27; control. However, if there is no automatic capture of the witness&#x27; attention, then weapon focus effect may be able to be overcome. Specific training can be developed to teach a person who may be at risk of an armed robbery, such as a bank teller or cashier, to perform an identification that is comparable to if there was no weapon present. The data indicate that weapons do not capture attention automatically and involuntarily. If a witness was given a lecture about weapon focus and the problems that can arise in memory formation in an incident when a weapon is present at the scene, they can more accurately identify a perpetrator of a crime. This shows that with proper training weapon focus effect can be overcome and an eyewitness&#x27; testimony becomes more accurate. These findings, however, are theoretical and need to be replicated in real world situations to really assess the usefulness of them. They show great promise that weapon focus effect and be counteracted by education on the topic, but they will remain theoretical until further research and implementation of the idea can be conducted. Later research by Pickel and Sneyd (2018) showed that subjects reported more correct details of a crime scene if the perpetrator was White compared to a Black perpetrator. Stereotypes regarding race where measured in the study and concluded that memory performance was not related to subject prejudices. Ratings showed that the subjects had a high awareness of stereotypes, and had a low endorsement of prejudices. The findings imply that the presence of a weapon may make it more difficult for law enforcement to bring White offenders over Black offenders to justice.

One method that has become more and more prevalent to reduce negative consequences that can stem from errors in eyewitness testimony, including errors that can arise from weapon focus effect, is expert witness testimonies by research psychologists about eyewitness testimony. This is an educational session, which a judge has to allow, given by a forensic psychologist to a jury as part of the trial. This form of expert testimony has been called social framework testimony, defined by Cronin as &quot;expert testimony that presents conclusions based on social science research to assist the court in making a decision.&quot; The expert testimony would provide the jury with a context for evaluating eyewitness testimonies and the jury is meant to factor that into its decision making process. These educational sessions in the courtroom will help make the presentation of eyewitness testimony as rigorous as possible and put as much scrutiny on the social evidence as what is put on physical, scientific evidence. Eyewitness testimony is very often wrong, and the scrutiny put on it greatly reduces the number of false convictions. Another way eyewitness testimony can be impaired even more by weapon focus is if the person in question is intoxicated. A study conducted in 2020 was done to observe what would happen if a person that was witnessing a crime was intoxicated and how it would affect their ability to retrieve crime scene data. The study found that if a person was intoxicated, they were more likely to focus on the weapon than people who weren’t intoxicated. This should be taken into consideration when retrieving information from people in the incident and will help to get better eyewitness testimony.

The major problem with this strategy is that many judges do not allow this expert testimony in their courts. For example, in the court case Blasdell v. State (2010, 2015) a woman who had been robbed at gunpoint by an unknown man was able to describe the gun in great detail but could only provide very imprecise details of the perpetrator. The defense was unable to present expert testimony on the concept of weapon focus and the suspect was convicted based on the eyewitness testimony. Despite cases like these, reasoning behind judges not permitting expert testimony is Their reasoning is usually that they think what the social framework testimony will present is common knowledge. However, the data overwhelmingly shows that the typical jury member does not know most of the information presented by the expert. The fallibility of eyewitness testimony is not common knowledge and eyewitness psychology can offer valid and constructive information to juries. Even with this knowledge, jury decisions cannot perfectly serve justice without exceptions, but perfection in the legal system is an unattainable goal. However, any information that can be presented about the shortcomings of eyewitness testimony can better serve justice in the long run. According to a 2001 survey of experts on eyewitness testimony, 87% found the weapon focus effect to be sufficiently reliable to form the basis of expert testimony in criminal trials. Regarding eyewitness testimony, another study by Shaw and Skolnick (1994) discovered that sex plays a role in eyewitness memory and recall of a crime. Both men and women identified targets of their own sex more easily than target persons of the opposite sex. Women identified other women more accurately and men identified men more accurately than the women did.

There can be some ethical concerns to these expert witnesses. There are arguments that suggest that these social framework testimonies discredit the eyewitnesses and put the victims and bystanders on trial. This is not the purpose of the experts though. These testimonies are merely attempting to educate jury members of problems that can arise from eyewitnesses. There can also be issues raised about the credibility of the expert testimonies. The screening process of the experts is not very stringent and the criteria of an expert witness are not laid out in black in white. This can lead to a battle of the experts between prosecution and defense. Any testimony the prosecution or defense deems relevant to contradict the opposing side may be introduced if the judge allows it, so an expert can be called and a battle of the experts can ensue. This takes away from the central point of a trial and can overwhelm the jury.

<text>Jan Baptist Weenix, also spelled Jan Baptiste Weeninx (1621–c. 1659), was a painter of the Dutch Golden Age. Despite his relatively brief career, he was a very productive and versatile painter. His favourite subjects were Italian landscapes with large figures among ruins, seaside views, and, later in life, large still life pictures of dead game or dogs. He was mainly responsible for introducing the Italian harbour scene into Dutch art, in mid-size paintings with a group of figures in the foreground.

==Life==

Weenix was born near Amsterdam&#x27;s harbour, the son of an architect.
He could not speak well, apparently from a medical condition, and because he very much liked to read books, his mother sent him to work for a bookseller, who was not able to deal with him. 
He drew whenever he could, according to Jan Weenix his son, who told the story to Arnold Houbraken.

Weenix first studied under Jan Micker, who was the brother-in-law of his oldest sister Lysbeth. He then studied in Utrecht under Abraham Bloemaert, and later back in Amsterdam under Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert. 
In 1639, he married Josijntje d&#x27;Hondecoeter, the daughter of Gillis d&#x27;Hondecoeter. In 1643, Weenix travelled to Rome with Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem, who had also studied with Moeyaert.
He had left his home in secret, but his wife traced him to Rotterdam. He was allowed to stay away for four months. 
In Rome, he became a member of the Bentvueghels with the name &quot;Ratel&quot; (meaning rattle, because a voice defect), and was much esteemed and worked for Pope Innocent X.
He returned to Amsterdam after four years; his wife had refused to come to Rome.

In 1649, he became master of the guild of St. Luke in Utrecht, and also painted a portrait of René Descartes. 
When his brother-in-law Gijsbert d&#x27;Hondecoeter died, he trained his nephew Melchior d&#x27;Hondecoeter, together with his own son Jan Weenix. Weenix rented the castle at Haarzuilens outside Utrecht, to concentrate on his work or for health reasons (plague). On 25 April 1659 the inventory of his estate was auctioned off. His widow, who had been living on Wittevrouwenstraat, in Utrecht, was buried on 6 October 1662.

He painted a few religious scenes, one of the rare pieces of this kind being the &quot;Jacob and Esau&quot; (Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden). In the National Gallery, London, is a &quot;Hunting Scene&quot; by Weenix, and Glasgow has a characteristic painting of ruins. Weenix is represented at most of the important continental galleries, notably at Munich, Vienna, Berlin, Amsterdam, and St Petersburg.

<text>Jan Weenix or Joannis Wenix (between 1641/164919 September 1719 (buried)) was a Dutch painter. He was trained by his father, Jan Baptist Weenix, together with his cousin Melchior d&#x27;Hondecoeter. Like his father, he painted various subjects, but is mostly known for his paintings of dead game and hunting scenes. Many paintings in this genre were formerly ascribed to the elder Weenix, but are now generally considered to be the work of the son.

==Life==
Jan Weenix was born in Amsterdam according to his notice of marriage in 1679 but his date of birth is not exactly known as the baptismal record of this catholic church did not survive. Between 1643 and 1647 his father (Jan Baptist) worked in Italy, but the family moved to Utrecht around 1649. His father subsequently moved into a castle near Vleuten, but died rather young in 1659.

By the age of twenty Jan Weenix rivalled and later surpassed his father in breadth of treatment and richness of colour. Jan Weenix was a member of the Utrecht guild of painters in 1664 and 1668.

Marriage and children

In 1679, Jan Weenix married the 20-year-old Pieternella Backers (he told the schepen he was &quot;around thirty&quot;). Between 1680 and 1700, the couple had 13 children who were baptized in a hidden church. At least four were sons –Jan Baptista (1680-), Willem Ignatius (1690-1764), Jacobus (1693-), Nicolaes Andreas (1699-1757) – and two were daughters: Sara and Maria Weenix (1697–1774).


In 1697 he painted a portrait of Peter the Great, visiting the Republic to study shipbuilding, science, and the art of fortification building. In Amsterdam, Weenix was frequently employed to decorate private houses with wall-paintings on canvas.

He painted five fixed paintings or wallpaper on canvas for Jacob de Granada; these became very popular in the second half of the 18th century when nature and Rousseau were fashionable and copied. The paintings survived in the house until 1922. Then the enormous &quot;paintings&quot; were sold before an auction to William Randolph Hearst in a private arrangement. After Hearst went bankrupt, the paintings were dispersed; one is in the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, two are in the Hotel Carlyle in New York, one has been in the Allen Memorial Art Museum since 1953 and one is lost.

Between 1702 and 1712 Weenix was occupied with an important series of twelve large hunting pictures for the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm&#x27;s castle of Bensberg, near Cologne. Also Eglon van der Neer, Rachel Ruysch, Adriaen van der Werff had a very good relationship with the court, being paid well or knighted as ridder and probably meeting an international crowd of artists and musicians. The treasury was empty when Jan Wellem, as he was called in Düsseldorf, died. Most of this collection is now at the Munich Gallery.

Weenix&#x27; pupils were his daughter Maria Weenix and Dirk Valkenburg.
Jan Weenix lived most of his life in a house across the Mint Tower and was buried in Nieuwezijds Kapel a nearby catholic church on the Rokin. His widow and daughters stayed in the masonry business, selling stones and tiles.

==Work==

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was impressed by the treatment of animals in Weenix pictures which he saw in Munich. He devoted a poem to Weenix&#x27;s technique, in which he stated that Weenix equaled and even surpassed nature in his treatment of animal textures such as hair, feathers and claws.

Many of his best works are to be found in English private collections. The National Gallery, London has two paintings, including &quot;A Deerhound with Dead Game and Implements of the Chase&quot;, while the Wallace Collection (also in London) has thirteen paintings, including &quot;Flowers on a Fountain with a Peacock.&quot;

Outside the United Kingdom, Jan Weenix is well represented in the galleries of Amsterdam, The Hague, Haarlem, Rotterdam, Berlin, Lisbon and Paris. A medium-sized Weenix, &quot;Still Life with Dead Game&quot;, hangs in the dining room of the Filoli estate in California. A certain &quot;Still Life with Hunting Trophies&quot; hangs in the Ackland Art Museum, Chapel Hill, NC, and a large &quot;Peacock with Hunting Trophies&quot; hangs in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. &quot;Boy with Toys, Pet Monkey and a Turkey&quot; is in the Kresge Art Museum. &quot;Still Life with Dead Hare&quot; in the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kyiv.

<text>Allaert van Everdingen (; bapt. 18 June 16218 November 1675 (buried)), was a Dutch Golden Age painter and printmaker in etching and mezzotint.

==Biography==
Van Everdingen was born at Alkmaar, the son of a government clerk. He and his older brothers, the painters Jan and Caesar van Everdingen, according to Arnold Houbraken, were taught by Roelandt Savery at Utrecht. Allaert moved in 1645 to Haarlem, where he studied under Pieter de Molijn. In February of that year he married Janneke Cornelisdr. Their first child, Cornelis, was born a year later. Allart finally settled about 1657 in Amsterdam, where he died in 1675.

===Style===
It would be difficult to find a greater contrast than that presented by the works of Savery and Everdingen. Savery inherited the brilliant style of the Brueghels, which he carried into the 17th century; whilst Everdingen realized the large and effective system of coloured and powerfully shaded landscape which characterises the precursors of Rembrandt. A fascination with the exotic is probably what inspired Allaert to travel himself, though it is quite within the range of probability that he acquired his approach from his drawing master, Pieter de Molijn.

===Norwegian waterfalls===
In 1644 Everdingen travelled to Norway and Sweden, a trip that was to have profound consequences on his art. According to his biographer Arnold Houbraken, his visit to Norway was unscheduled, but occurred when his ship, en route to the Baltic Sea, ran into a heavy storm and moored there for shelter. In the manner of Frans Post, Everdingen took advantage of this mishap by making sketches of the Norwegian landscape, which would have seemed very exotic to his Dutch countrymen. His annotated drawings document visits to the south-east Norwegian coast and to Bohusland and the Göteborg area in western Sweden. These sketches, which he later painted in his studio, became very popular, and though now scarce, exhibit a broad and sweeping mode of execution, differing but slightly from that transmitted at the dawn of the 17th century from Jan van Goyen to Salomon van Ruysdael. He returned to the Netherlands by 21 February 1645, when he married Janneke Cornelisdr Brouwers in Haarlem. He died in Amsterdam.

===Haarlem school of landscape artists===
Molijn wielded his own influence on his gifted disciple, but the school of landscape painters in Haarlem brought forth many young, talented artists who incorporated the tonal qualities of van Goyen. This can be seen in the development of Isaac van Ostade, who abandoned the genre techniques of his brother Adriaen van Ostade for the broader landscapes of the Ruisdael family. In Utrecht Allert would have also met Savery&#x27;s nephew and namesake, the landscape artist and engraver Roelant Roghman, who probably returned with him on his trips to Alkmaar, where he made many prints. Alkmaar, itself a busy trading place near Texel island, had little of the picturesque for an artist except polders and dunes or waves and sky. Accordingly, we find Allaert at first a painter of coast scenery. But on one of his expeditions he is said to have been cast ashore in Norway, and during the repairs of his ship he visited the inland valleys, and thus gave a new course to his art.

==Works==
In early pieces he cleverly represents the sea in motion under varied, but mostly clouded, aspects of sky. Their general intonation is strong and brown, and effects are rendered in a powerful key, but the execution is much more uniform than that of Jacob van Ruisdael. A dark scud lowering on a rolling sea near the walls of Flushing characterizes Everdingens Mouth of the Schelde in the Hermitage at St Petersburg. Storm is the marked feature of sea-pieces in the Staedel or Robartes collections; and a strand with wreckers at the foot of a cliff in the Munich Pinakothek may be a reminiscence of personal adventure in Norway. But the Norwegian coast was studied in calms as well as in gales; and a fine canvas at Munich shows fishermen on a still and sunny day taking herrings to a smoking hut at the foot of a Norwegian crag.

The earliest of Everdingen&#x27;s sea-pieces bears the date of 1640. After 1640 we meet with nothing but representations of inland scenery, and particularly of Norwegian valleys, remarkable alike for wildness and a decisive depth of tone. The masters favorite theme is a fall in a glen, with mournful fringes of pines interspersed with birch, and log-huts at the base of rocks and craggy slopes. The water tumbles over the foreground, so as to entitle the painter to the name of inventor of cascades. It gives Everdingen his character as a precursor of Jacob van Ruisdael in a certain form of landscape composition; but though very skillful in arrangement and clever in effects, Everdingen remains much more simple in execution; he is much less subtle in feeling or varied in touch than his great and incomparable countryman.

Five of Everdingen&#x27;s cascades are in the museum of Copenhagen alone: of these, one is dated 1647, another 1649. In the Hermitage at St Petersburg is a fine example of 1647; another in the Pinakothek at Munich was finished in 1656. One of his best-known masterpieces is the Norwegian glen belonging to Lord Listowel. Of his etchings and drawings there are much larger and more numerous specimens in England than elsewhere. Being a collector as well as an engraver and painter, he brought together a large number of works of all kinds and masters; and the sale of these by his heirs at Amsterdam on 11 March 1676 gives an approximate clue to the date of the painters death.

His two brothers, Jan and Caesar, were both good painters according to Houbraken, though Jan had a civil job that kept him from his hobby.

<doc id="840093" wikidata="Q537355" url="?curid=840093" title="Carlos Seixas">
<text>José António Carlos de Seixas (; 11 June 1704 – 25 August 1742) was a pre-eminent Portuguese composer of the 18th century. An accomplished virtuoso of both the organ and the harpsichord, Seixas succeeded his father as the organist for Coimbra Cathedral at the age of fourteen. In 1720, he departed for the capital, Lisbon, where he was to serve as the organist for the royal chapel, one of the highest offices for a musician in Portugal, a position which earned him a knighthood. Much of Seixas&#x27; music rests in an ambiguous transitional period from the learned style of the 17th century to the galant style of the 18th century.

==Life==
Seixas was born in Coimbra to Francisco Vaz and Marcelina Nunes. From a young age, he was surrounded by musical activity; his father served as the cathedral organist, and the flurry of musical activity in the local monastery of Santa Cruz had an equally important role in his musical training. In 1718, a few days before his father&#x27;s death, Seixas succeeded his father as cathedral organist. Two years after, in 1720, he moved to Lisbon to take up his new position in the court of John V of Portugal as court organist and harpsichordist.

Citing his elegance and agility on the keyboard, he was a favorite teacher of many noble families, including the family of , the Viscount of Barbacena, where he gave harpsichord lessons to the Viscount&#x27;s wife and daughters in exchange for artistic patronage. In Lisbon, Seixas met Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti, who was working in Portugal from 1719 to 1728 as appointed director of the court cathedral. In an account by José Mazza in his &quot;Diccionario biographico de Musicos portugueses e noticia das suas composições of 1780,&quot; the king&#x27;s brother, Dom António, arranged for Scarlatti to give Seixas harpsichord lessons. Scarlatti, immediately recognizing Seixas&#x27; talent, replied, &quot;You can give me lessons.&quot;

In 1731 he was married at age twenty-eight to D. Maria Joana Tomásia da Silva, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. He was knighted in 1738 by the king, inducted into the Order of Christ. Four years later, in 1742, he died of a rheumatic fever, and was buried in the Santa Maria Basilica in Lisbon. 

==Works==
Seixas&#x27; keyboard works were written for a variety of instruments, including the organ, harpsichord, and the clavichord. Stylistically speaking, however, his sonatas showcase a range of musical styles: some are exemplary of a Baroque toccata; some are firmly in the galant style; some are clearly influenced by the German &quot;Empfindsamer Stil&quot; (literally &#x27;sensitive style&#x27;). Despite rarely, if ever, traveling outside of Lisbon, his work also includes various geographical styles, such as the German Mannheim school, the French minuet, and the Italian style as composed by Scarlatti, his colleague and contemporary. Santiago Kastner, Seixas&#x27; biographer and editor of his pieces, describes Seixas&#x27; works as &quot;unoccupied&quot; with a particular form, and given over to frequent improvisation. Much of his work was destroyed in the earthquake that devastated Lisbon in 1755. Only three orchestral pieces and around one hundred keyboard sonatas out of over an alleged seven hundred survived, plus a handful of choral works for liturgical use (much more conservative than what one would expect from his instrumental music).

Macario Santiago Kastner published collections of the sonatas in &quot;Portugaliae Musica.&quot;

<doc id="840099" wikidata="Q1851515" url="?curid=840099" title="500 home run club">
<text>In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. There are twenty-eight players who are members of the 500 home run club. Seven 500 home run club members—Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez and Miguel Cabrera—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. 
In the past, membership in the 500 home run club was a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years and many members have not been enshrined in Cooperstown. 

All 15 players who became members of the 500 home run club between 1929 and 1996 are members of the Hall of Fame. Of the 11 players who made the 500 homer club between 1999 and 2015 who are Hall of Fame eligible, only four have been enshrined in Cooperstown. Seven eligible club members—Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Mark McGwire, Palmeiro, Manny Ramirez, Gary Sheffield and Sammy Sosa—have not been elected to the Hall. Bonds is one of only four members in the 700 home run club and Rodriguez and Sosa are members of the 600 homer club, all of whose other members are Hall of Famers except for the recently retired Albert Pujols, who hit 703 career home runs and is not eligible until 2027. 

Bonds and Sosa made their first appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot in ; Bonds received only 36.2% and Sosa 12.5% of the total votes, with 75% required for induction. Eligibility requires that a player has &quot;been retired five seasons&quot; or be deceased for at least six months. Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009. Additionally, several of these recent members - including all seven aforementioned eligible members - have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall the voters were establishing a &quot;referendum&quot; on how they would treat players from the &quot;Steroid Era&quot;. On January 8, 2014, Palmeiro became the first member of the club to be removed from the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot after failing to appear on at least 5.0% of ballots.

On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth surpassed Roger Connor&#x27;s record of 138 career homers during the 1921 season, and was the first player to hit 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 career home runs. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron&#x27;s ultimate career total, 755, remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Miguel Cabrera, who hit his 500th home run on August 22, 2021; As of the end of the 2024 season, there are no active members of the club.

<text>JT Group Limited (doing business as JT) is the parent company of several subsidiaries including Jersey Telecom Limited and Wave Telecom Limited. Jersey Telecom is the former monopoly operator in the Bailiwick of Jersey. JT provides telecommunications, Internet access and other services, mostly within the Channel Islands.

==History==

In 1972 legislation was passed in Jersey, which led the States of Jersey to take over the country&#x27;s telephone exchanges from the British Post Office. A state monopoly was formed through the Telecommunications Board in 1973, and remained under state control until 2003, when the market was opened to competition. In 2002 JT was granted licences by the Office of Utility Regulation to operate fixed and mobile telecommunications services to, from and within the Bailiwick of Guernsey and was known as Wave Telecom. The following year in 2003, Jersey Telecom became a private company, though it remained under 100% ownership by the States.

In 2006 the States of Jersey Council of Ministers proposed the sale of JT Limited. In 2008, following comments in the Scrutiny report and market uncertainty, the Minister for Treasury and Resources decided to withdraw the proposition. In November 2006 JT then announced that it was to install a new high capacity optical submarine cable from Dartmouth to L&#x27;Ancresse Bay on the north west tip of Guernsey. In 2009 Graeme Millar, formerly Chief Commercial Officer of Mobile TeleSystems, the Russian mobile operator, became the CEO of JT.

In April 2010 JT relaunched its Next Generation Networking (NGN) programme which had run into technical difficulties the previous autumn. In September 2011, Jersey Telecom changed its name to JT. The following year, in 2012, JT acquired Worldstone. In September 2014, JT began work on a £12m 4G network in Jersey. The first masts went live in February 2015 and full Island coverage was reached three months later. On 28 March 2014 JT partnered with Fon and the service became available to JT broadband subscribers connected to fibre in 2016.

===Digital sandbox===
In 2018 JT began partnering with Sony in order to test its newly developed Low-Power, Wide-Area Wireless Network (LPWAN) technology, for use in the Internet of Things where low speed data links are utilized. That year JT also partnered with ZTE to bring a 5G network to the Channel islands. Both deals are a part of JT&#x27;s and Jersey&#x27;s role as a &quot;digital sandbox&quot;, for testing new telecommunications technologies. That year JT was named Digital Company of the Year award at the Jersey TechAwards.

==Operations==
===Wave Telecom===
JT Group has operated in the Bailiwick of Guernsey since 2002 through the subsidiary company &quot;Wave Telecom Limited&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary of the JT Group, which was later renamed JT with the rest of the company&#x27;s properties.

===JT Fibre===
JT Fibre is a fibre to the home service, was initiated with a budget of £41.5m with £20m provided by the States of Jersey. The first homes were connected in February 2012. The project ran into difficulties in 2013 due to a dispute between JT and contractors and JT established a new subsidiary to take the programme forward. In November 2015, JT admitted that the project was behind schedule and could finish three years after its 2016 completion deadline. In January 2017, JT announced that the work was 70% complete. The project was delayed as the result of services having to be provided to additional new homes that had been built since the project began.

In 2018, JT announced that thanks to the completion of its full-fibre network, Jersey had become the first jurisdiction in the world where 100 percent of broadband users were on its fibre network. The JT Fibre project began in 2012 with a budget of £41.5m, of which £20m was provided by the Government of Jersey. The first properties were connected in February 2012, but the project ran into difficulties with JT defending the progress after criticism in the States Assembly. JT has laid over 3,000 km of individual fibre-optic cable to over 45,000 homes and businesses providing access, regardless of means, to the whole Island.

In January 2020, JT announced it was doubling broadband speeds from 250 Mbit/s to 500 Mbit/s for all subscribers. In March, following discussions with Digital Jersey and other telecom operators, JT increased speeds to 1 Gbit/s at no extra cost as part of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.

As of 2021, JT has the fastest network in the world.

===IoT===
JT sold a majority stake in its Internet of Things business in June 2021
to family-backed private equity firm Perwyn. The business
continues to operate from Jersey as Velos IoT.

== Partnerships and international business ==
In 2019, JT signed a partnership with Speednet Communications, the leading mobile network provider in Belize. The deal meant JT would provide a fully managed roaming service using its existing 2G, 3G and 4G roaming connectivity. The partnership added to JT&#x27;s already wide roaming network that has access to over 700 networks around the world.

JT upgraded its mobile network to be able to cope with future demands and technologies by signing a deal with ECI to upgrade its optical network.

== Technology ==

===JT Lab===
JT Lab provides facilities for the trial and testing of telecoms related products in small-scale and live environments. JT Group is regulated by the Channel Islands Competition and Regulatory Authorities.

===Gigabit Isles===
In the early 2010s, JT created the Gigabit Isles project, in order to spread access to FTTP broadband to the full population if the Isles region, at various data rates.

=== 5G ===
Along with other mobile operators, JT has taken part in limited trials of 5G at two test sites, one in Jersey and the other Guernsey. Roll out of 5G is dependent on licences being issued by the telecoms regulator, the JCRA.

== Finance ==

=== Profits ===
In 2019, JT returned £17m in dividends to the Government of Jersey&#x27;s Treasury, which was in line with previous years. However, the Jersey Evening Post reported a fall in profits which JT&#x27;s CEO Graeme Millar explained was down to higher operating costs and investment in major projects and developments. In 2018, profits after tax were £2.2m, a drop of more than half. JT said cutting roaming charges had hit revenue and it had been expensive to increase the number of broadband users on unlimited contracts.

<doc id="840102" wikidata="Q1340217" url="?curid=840102" title="Encyclopédie Méthodique">
<text>The Encyclopédie méthodique par ordre des matières () was published between 1782 and 1832 by the French publisher Charles Joseph Panckoucke, his son-in-law Henri Agasse, and the latter&#x27;s wife, Thérèse-Charlotte Agasse. Arranged by disciplines, it was a revised and much expanded version, in roughly 210 to 216 volumes (different sets were bound differently), of the alphabetically arranged &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. The full title was &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie méthodique ou par ordre de matières par une société de gens de lettres, de savants et d&#x27;artistes; précédée d&#x27;un vocabulaire universel, servant de table pour tout l&#x27;ouvrage, ornée des portraits de MM. Diderot et d&#x27;Alembert, premiers éditeurs de l&#x27;Encyclopédie.&quot;

== Development ==
Two sets of Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; and its supplements were cut up into articles. Each subject category was entrusted to a specialized editor, whose job was to collect all articles relating to his subject and exclude those belonging to others. Great care was to be taken of those articles that were of a doubtful nature, which were not to be omitted. For certain topics, such as air (which belonged equally to chemistry, physics and medicine), the methodical arrangement had the unexpected effect of breaking up a single article into several parts. Each volume was to have its own introduction, a table of contents, and a history of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The whole work was to be linked together by a &quot;Vocabulaire universel&quot; (Vol. 14), with references to all locations where each word appears.

The prospectus, issued early in 1782, proposed three editions, each with seven volumes of 250 to 300 plates:
* 84 volumes;
* 43 volumes, with 3 columns per page; and
* 53 volumes of about 100 sheets, with 2 columns per page.

Subscription was priced at:
* 672 livres from the March 15 to July 1782
* 751 livres from August 1782 to March 1783; and
* 888 livres after April 1783.

The &quot;livraisons&quot; (home-deliveries) were to be in two volumes each, the first (Jurisprudence, Vol. 1; Literature, Vol. 1,) to appear in July 1782, and the whole to be finished by 1787. The number of subscribers, 4072, was so great that the subscription list for the price of 672 livres was closed on April 30. Twenty-five printing offices were employed, and in November 1782, the first &quot;livraison&quot; (Jurisprudence, Vol. 1; and half volume each of &quot;Arts et métiers&quot; and &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot;) was issued.

A Spanish prospectus was sent out and obtained 330 Spanish subscribers, with the inquisitor-general at their head.

The complaints of the subscribers and his own heavy advances of over 150,000 livres induced Panckoucke, in November 1788, to appeal to the authors to finish the work. Those who were behind made new contracts, giving their word of honor to put their parts to press by 1788, so that Panckoucke hoped to finish the whole, including the &quot;Vocabulaire universel&quot; (4 or 5 vols.) by 1792.

Entire topics such as architecture, engineering, hunting, police, and games had been overlooked in the prospectus. A new division was made in 44 parts, to contain 51 dictionaries, and about 124 volumes. Permission was obtained on February 27, 1789 to receive subscriptions for separate dictionaries. Two thousand subscribers were lost in the French Revolution.

The 50th &quot;livraison&quot; appeared on July 23, 1792, by which time all the dictionaries eventually published had been begun except for seven: &quot;Jeux familiers&quot; and &quot;mathématiques&quot;, physics, &quot;Art oratoire&quot;, physical geography, &quot;Chasses&quot; and &quot;Pèches&quot;. On the other hand, eighteen volumes were now finished: &quot;Mathématics&quot;, games, surgery, ancient and modern geography, history, theology, logic, grammar, jurisprudence, finance, political economy, commerce, marine, military science, academic art, arts and crafts, and &quot;Encyclopédiana&quot;. Of the three parts of &quot;Assemblée Nationale&quot;:
* the History of the Revolution;
* Debates; and
* Laws and Decrees;
only volume 2, i.e. &quot;Debates&quot;, appeared in 1792, with 804 pages (Absens to Aurillac). Supplements were added to military art in 1797, and to history in 1807, but not to any of the other 16, despite many changes in knowledge by 1832.

The publication was continued by Henri Agasse, Panckoucke&#x27;s son-in-law, from 1794 to 1813, and then by the latter&#x27;s widow, Mme Agasse, until 1832, when it was completed in 102 livraisons or 337 parts, forming roughly 166½ volumes of text (depending on how the parts were bound) as well as 51 illustrated parts containing 6,439 plates. The number of pages totalled 124,210 pages, of which 5,458 pages were plates. To save money, the plates belonging to architecture were not published. Pharmacy (separated from chemistry), minerals, education, &quot;Ponts et chausses&quot; were not published as had been announced.

Many dictionaries have a classed index of articles. The one in &quot;Oeconomie politique&quot; is an excellent example, giving the contents of each article, so that any passage can be found easily.

When &quot;completed,&quot; the encyclopedia suffered at least one great weakness. As the &quot;Vocabulaire Universel&quot;, the key and index to the entire work, was not published, it was difficult to carry out any research or to find all the articles on any particular subject. The original parts had often been subdivided, and had been so added onto by other dictionaries, supplements, and appendices that an exact account could not be given of the work, which contained 88 alphabets, 83 indexes, 166 introductions, discourses, prefaces, etc. Overall, probably no more an unmanageable body of dictionaries has ever been published, except Jacques Paul Migne&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie théologique&quot;, Paris, 1844–1875, with 168 volumes, 101 dictionaries, and 119,059 pages.

The &quot;Encyclopédie méthodique par ordre des matières&quot; occupied a thousand workers in production, and 2,250 contributors.

== Translations ==
Ten volumes of a Spanish translation with a volume of plates were published at Madrid in 1806:
* &quot;Historia natural&quot;, Vol. 1-2
* &quot;Grammatica&quot;, Vol. 1
* &quot;Arte militar&quot;, Vol. 1-2
* &quot;Geografia&quot;, Vol. 1-3
* &quot;Fabricas&quot;, Vol. 1-2
* &quot;Plates&quot;, Vol. 1

A French edition was printed at Padua, with the plates, very carefully engraved.

== Details of encyclopedia format ==
The division adopted was:

The largest dictionaries were:
* Zoology: 13,645 pages, 1206 plates (7 vols.);
* Botany: 12,002 pages, 1,000 plates (34 only of cryptogamic plants);
* Medicine: 10,330 pages (13 vols.);
* Geography: 9,090 pages, 193 maps and plates (3 vols. and 2 atlases);
* Jurisprudence (with police and municipalities): 7,607 pages (10 vols.); and
* Anatomy (not a dictionary but a series of systematic treatises): 2,866 pages (4 vols.).

<doc id="840104" wikidata="Q1532858" url="?curid=840104" title="South Kentish Town tube station">
<text>South Kentish Town is a disused London Underground station located in Kentish Town, north London, on the branch of the Northern line.

It was opened in 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway but closed in 1924 due to low passenger usage. Latterly, it was on what is now the Northern line&#x27;s High Barnet branch between Camden Town and Kentish Town stations. The surface building survives on Kentish Town Road near its junction with Castle Road and is currently a retail unit.

==History==
South Kentish Town station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR) on its branch to Highgate (now Archway).
The station was planned to be called Castle Road; however, this was changed just before it opened. The Castle Road name had already been fired into the original Leslie Green tiles inside the station, so after the name change they were painted over with the revised name.

On 20 April 1924, trains of the City &amp; South London Railway began to call at the station as the connection between the CCE&amp;HR and C&amp;SLR at allowed the C&amp;SLR to extend its services northwards along the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s northern branches. This situation would only last for seven weeks. The station was temporarily closed following unofficial strike action at Lots Road Power Station during the afternoon of 5 June 1924. It was decided not to re-open the station after the power was restored, due to the very low number of passengers using it; in fact, since as early as 1908 some trains did not stop there. During the Blitz in the Second World War it was adapted for use as an air-raid shelter.

There have been occasional proposals to rebuild the platforms and the station as part of the redevelopment plans for Camden Town. The layout of South Kentish Town is similar to Kentish Town (also originally a CCE&amp;HR station); with two diameter lift-shafts and an diameter spiral staircase. South Kentish Town now serves as an access point for permanent way works and as an emergency egress point for passenger services.

A 1951 short story called &quot;South Kentish Town&quot; by John Betjeman told the fictional story of a passenger who became trapped in the disused station. It was based on a true incident where a train stopped at the station and mistakenly opened its doors, but in reality nobody became trapped.

As of 2016, the station building housed a retail unit and a yoga studio. From 2021, it contained three escape rooms themed to its heritage as both a former Underground station (with the aforementioned John Betjeman story being a crucial plot point) and a World War 2 air-raid shelter.

<text>The Sun Sessions is a compilation album by American singer Elvis Presley, issued by RCA Records in 1976. The album contains Presley&#x27;s earliest commercial recordings, made in Memphis, Tennessee, for Sun Records in 1954 and 1955. RCA issued the album in the UK in 1975 under the title The Sun Collection. The album features liner notes by Roy Carr of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;. &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; features most of the tracks Elvis recorded for Sun Records and produced by Sam Phillips, the head of Sun Studios. &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums and number 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Country Albums charts.

In 2002, &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; was chosen by the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress to be included in its archives given their importance to the development of American popular music. In 2003, the album was ranked number 11 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, although its place in future revisions of the list was supplanted by &quot;Sunrise&quot;, a similar, larger compilation. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll included two tracks from the album: &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s All Right.&quot;

==Recording==

The album features most of the tracks Elvis recorded at Sun studio and were produced by Sam Phillips, the head of Sun Studios. Elvis began his singing career with Sun Records label in Memphis. Phillips signed Presley after hearing a song that he had recorded for his mother on his birthday.

Phillips said that Presley was rehearsing with his band, Scotty Moore and Bill Black, when Presley started singing the song, a blues song written by Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup. Phillips said that the version of the song was what he was looking for when he signed Presley, and turned the tape recorder on.

Elvis recorded more than 20 songs at Sun, including some private recordings. Of these, 15 appear on this album.

Missing songs:
*&quot;Harbor Lights&quot;
*&quot;Tomorrow Night&quot;
*&quot;When It Rains, It Really Pours&quot;
*&quot;I Got a Woman&quot; (tape lost)
*&quot;Satisfied&quot; (tape lost)
*The earlier private recordings

In 1987, RCA Records released &quot;The Complete Sun Sessions&quot; which included all 15 tracks previously issued on &quot; The Sun Sessions&quot; plus &quot;Harbor Lights&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot;, &quot;When It Rains, It Really Pours&quot;, and 14 other outtakes. Although the album claims to contain the &quot;Complete&quot; Sun recordings, the collection was still missing &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;, &quot;Satisfied&quot; and the earlier private recordings.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; was released in March 1976 and reached No. 76 on the pop and No. 2 on the country charts.

The single &quot;Baby, Let&#x27;s Play House&quot; combined with &quot;I&#x27;m Left, You&#x27;re Right, She&#x27;s Gone&quot; reached No. 5 on the country charts in 1955. Aware that Elvis was rapidly building a reputation for his live performances, RCA Victor bought out Presley&#x27;s contract with Sun Records for $35,000.

The single &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; did not chart in the US when released in 1954, and it was never issued as a single in Great Britain during Presley&#x27;s lifetime. In 2004, the song became the focus of attention when it was the subject of a great deal of publicity because of the 50-year anniversary. There was a special ceremony on July 6, 2004, featuring Isaac Hayes, Justin Timberlake and Scotty Moore which was beamed live to 1200 radio stations. The song went top five in the UK and Canada and also charted in Australia. &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; was also re-released in 2004 (in Japan only) to celebrate the anniversary.

==Reception and legacy==

After &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; was released, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau hailed &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; as &quot;the rock reissue of the year&quot;, writing in that along with &quot;Chuck Berry&#x27;s Golden Decade&quot;, its songs represented the wellspring of rock music. He later included it in his &quot;basic record library&quot; of essential albums from the 1950s and 1960s, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

In 2003, the album&#x27;s 1999 extended 2CD reissue was ranked No. 11 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 78 in the 2020 reboot of the list. In 2001, the TV channel VH1 named it the 21st greatest album of all time. Music scholar Michael Campbell called it &quot;quintessential rockabilly&quot; with Presley&#x27;s voice &quot;the magical element&quot; drawing on country and rhythm and blues but confined to neither, while AllMusic critic Cub Koda said &quot;what we ultimately have here is a young Elvis Presley, mixing elements of blues, gospel and hillbilly music together and getting ready to unleash its end result – rock &amp; roll – on an unsuspecting world.&quot;

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll included two tracks from the album: &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s All Right.&quot; In 2002, &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; were chosen by the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress to be included in its archives given their importance to the development of American popular music. This album is the very first Elvis album to feature &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care If The Sun Don&#x27;t Shine&quot;, which was only previously issued as a single. After more than 20 years, &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; marked the song&#x27;s official debut on LP.

==Track listing==

Note
*The last six tracks are original Sun recordings, but were not issued until 1956 on Presley&#x27;s first album for RCA Victor. They were never released on the Sun label.

<doc id="840106" wikidata="Q722878" url="?curid=840106" title="Master equation">
<text>In physics, chemistry, and related fields, master equations are used to describe the time evolution of a system that can be modeled as being in a probabilistic combination of states at any given time, and the switching between states is determined by a transition rate matrix. The equations are a set of differential equations – over time – of the probabilities that the system occupies each of the different states.

The name was proposed in 1940:
==Introduction==
A master equation is a phenomenological set of first-order differential equations describing the time evolution of (usually) the probability of a system to occupy each one of a discrete set of states with regard to a continuous time variable &quot;t&quot;. The most familiar form of a master equation is a matrix form:
formula_1
where formula_2 is a column vector, and formula_3 is the matrix of connections. The way connections among states are made determines the dimension of the problem; it is either
*a d-dimensional system (where d is 1,2,3...), where any state is connected with exactly its 2d nearest neighbors, or
*a network, where every pair of states may have a connection (depending on the network&#x27;s properties).

When the connections are time-independent rate constants, the master equation represents a kinetic scheme, and the process is Markovian (any jumping time probability density function for state &quot;i&quot; is an exponential, with a rate equal to the value of the connection). When the connections depend on the actual time (i.e. matrix formula_3 depends on the time, formula_5 ), the process is not stationary and the master equation reads
formula_6

When the connections represent multi exponential jumping time probability density functions, the process is semi-Markovian, and the equation of motion is an integro-differential equation termed the generalized master equation:
formula_7

The matrix formula_3 can also represent birth and death, meaning that probability is injected (birth) or taken from (death) the system, and then the process is not in equilibrium.

==Detailed description of the matrix and properties of the system==
Let formula_3 be the matrix describing the transition rates (also known as kinetic rates or reaction rates). As always, the first subscript represents the row, the second subscript the column. That is, the source is given by the second subscript, and the destination by the first subscript. This is the opposite of what one might expect, but is appropriate for conventional matrix multiplication.

For each state &quot;k&quot;, the increase in occupation probability depends on the contribution from all other states to &quot;k&quot;, and is given by:
formula_10
where formula_11 is the probability for the system to be in the state formula_12, while the matrix formula_3 is filled with a grid of transition-rate constants. Similarly, formula_14 contributes to the occupation of all other states formula_15
formula_16

In probability theory, this identifies the evolution as a continuous-time Markov process, with the integrated master equation obeying a Chapman–Kolmogorov equation.

The master equation can be simplified so that the terms with &quot;ℓ&quot; = &quot;k&quot; do not appear in the summation. This allows calculations even if the main diagonal of formula_3 is not defined or has been assigned an arbitrary value.
formula_18

The final equality arises from the fact that 
formula_19 
because the summation over the probabilities formula_20 yields one, a constant function. Since this has to hold for any probability formula_2 (and in particular for any probability of the form formula_22 for some k) we get
formula_23 
Using this we can write the diagonal elements as
formula_24

The master equation exhibits detailed balance if each of the terms of the summation disappears separately at equilibrium—i.e. if, for all states &quot;k&quot; and &quot;ℓ&quot; having equilibrium probabilities formula_25 and formula_26,
formula_27

These symmetry relations were proved on the basis of the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics (microscopic reversibility) as Onsager reciprocal relations.

==Examples of master equations==
Many physical problems in classical, quantum mechanics and problems in other sciences, can be reduced to the form of a &quot;master equation&quot;, thereby performing a great simplification of the problem (see mathematical model).

The Lindblad equation in quantum mechanics is a generalization of the master equation describing the time evolution of a density matrix. Though the Lindblad equation is often referred to as a &quot;master equation&quot;, it is not one in the usual sense, as it governs not only the time evolution of probabilities (diagonal elements of the density matrix), but also of variables containing information about quantum coherence between the states of the system (non-diagonal elements of the density matrix).

Another special case of the master equation is the Fokker–Planck equation which describes the time evolution of a continuous probability distribution. Complicated master equations which resist analytic treatment can be cast into this form (under various approximations), by using approximation techniques such as the system size expansion.

Stochastic chemical kinetics provide yet another example of the use of the master equation. A master equation may be used to model a set of chemical reactions when the number of molecules of one or more species is small (of the order of 100 or 1000 molecules). The chemical master equation can also solved for the very large models, such as the DNA damage signal from fungal pathogen Candida albicans.

== Quantum master equations ==

A quantum master equation is a generalization of the idea of a master equation. Rather than just a system of differential equations for a set of probabilities (which only constitutes the diagonal elements of a density matrix), quantum master equations are differential equations for the entire density matrix, including off-diagonal elements. A density matrix with only diagonal elements can be modeled as a classical random process, therefore such an &quot;ordinary&quot; master equation is considered classical. Off-diagonal elements represent quantum coherence which is a physical characteristic that is intrinsically quantum mechanical.

The Redfield equation and Lindblad equation are examples of approximate quantum master equations assumed to be Markovian. More accurate quantum master equations for certain applications include the polaron transformed quantum master equation, and the VPQME (variational polaron transformed quantum master equation).

== Theorem about eigenvalues of the matrix and time evolution ==
Because formula_3 fulfills
formula_29
and 
formula_30 
one can show that: 
* There is at least one eigenvector with a vanishing eigenvalue, exactly one if the graph of formula_3 is strongly connected. 
* All other eigenvalues formula_32 fulfill formula_33.
* All eigenvectors formula_34 with a non-zero eigenvalue fulfill formula_35.

This has important consequences for the time evolution of a state.

<text>Smith&#x27;s longspur (Calcarius pictus) is a bird from the family Calcariidae, which also contains the other species of longspurs. A bird of open habitats, it breeds in northern Canada and Alaska, and winters in the southern United States. Primarily a ground-feeding seed-eater, it supplements its diet with insects in the summer.

== Description ==
These birds have short cone-shaped bills, streaked backs, and dark tails with white outer rectrices. In breeding state plumage (mostly formed by worn basic plumage), the male has a pumpkin-orange throat, nape, and underparts contrasting with an intricate black-and-white face pattern. The white lesser coverts are quite pronounced on a male in spring and early summer. Females and immatures have lightly streaked buffy underparts, dark crowns, brown wings with less obvious white lesser coverts, and a light-colored face. The tail is identical at all ages.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.9–6.7 in (15–17 cm)
* Weight: 0.7–1.1 oz (20–32 g)
* Wingspan: 25 cm

== Distribution and habitat ==
This bird breeds in open grassy areas near the tree line in northern Canada and Alaska. In winter, they congregate in open fields, including airports, in the south-central United States. Migration is elliptical, with northbound birds staging in Illinois in the spring and southbound birds flying over the Great Plains in the fall.

== Behavior ==
These birds nest in small colonies; males do not defend territory. The female lays three to five eggs in a grass cup nest on the ground. Both males and females may have more than one mate (polygynandry). The parents, one female and possibly more than one male, feed the young birds.

These birds forage on the ground, gathering in flocks outside of the nesting season. They mainly eat seeds, also eating insects in summer. Young birds are mainly fed insects.

The song is a sweet warble that is inflected at the end, somewhat reminiscent of the chestnut-sided warbler. The call is a dry rattle, like a shortened version of the call of a female brown-headed cowbird, noticeably drier than that of Lapland longspur.

Audubon named this bird after his friend Gideon B. Smith.

<text>Nigella is a genus of 18 species of annual plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native to Southern Europe, North Africa, South Asia, Southwest Asia and Middle East. Common names applied to members of this genus are nigella, devil-in-a-bush or love-in-a-mist.

The species grow to tall, with finely divided leaves; the leaf segments are narrowly linear to threadlike. The flowers are white, yellow, pink, pale blue or pale purple, with five to ten petals. The fruit is a capsule composed of several united follicles, each containing numerous seeds; in some species (e.g. &quot;Nigella damascena&quot;), the capsule is large and inflated.

== Uses ==
===Culinary===

The seeds of &quot;Nigella sativa&quot;, known as &quot;kalonji&quot;, black cumin, black caraway, black coriander, roman coriander, black onion seed, onion seed, charnushka, git (in historical Roman cuisine), or just nigella, are used as a spice and a condiment in South Asian, Ethiopian, Middle Eastern and Polish cuisines.

===Garden flowers===
Several species are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. &quot;Nigella damascena&quot; has been grown in English cottage gardens since the Elizabethan era, commonly called love-in-a-mist. &quot;Nigella hispanica&quot; is a taller species with larger blue flowers, red stamens, and grey leaves. Nigella seeds are self-sowing if the seed pods are left to mature.

The dried seed capsules can also be used in flower arrangements.

==Use in healthcare==
In traditional medicine, the seeds are used as a carminative and stimulant to ease bowel and indigestion problems, and are given to treat intestinal worms, nerve defects, to reduce flatulence, and induce sweating. Dried pods are sniffed to restore a lost sense of smell. It is also used to repel some insects, much like mothballs.
Numerous studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-mycotic, antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anti-viral, antihistamine properties, possessing many properties that make it a potential remedy against certain diseases.

Black cumin is used in naturopathy. Black cumin oil or powder are used in the treatment of pathologies such as skin diseases, muscle pain, eczema or psoriasis, but also acne, diabetes, asthma, A 2014 study showed its positive effects on the harmful effects of radiotherapy treatments.

Nigella oil contains almost 60% linoleic acid (omega 6).

It is available in capsule, oil or powder form, with both internal and external uses (in massages).

In Silico study of 96 phytochemical compounds of Nigella sativa, identifying Nigelladine A as the most promising compound for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition with the highest docking scores for the spike protein and Mpro. 
Thymoquinone is a phytochemical compound found in the plant Nigella sativa. 
Dithymoquinone, kaempferol, Nigelladine B, Nigelladine, and Nigelladine sulphate also showed high docking scores.

<text>The Royal Military Police (RMP) is the corps of the British Army responsible for the policing of army service personnel, and for providing a military police presence both in the UK and while service personnel are deployed overseas on operations and exercises. Members of the RMP are often known as &#x27;Redcaps&#x27; because of the scarlet covers on their peaked caps and scarlet coloured berets.

The RMP&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the 13th century but it was not until 1877 that a regular corps of military police was formed with the creation of the Military Mounted Police, which was followed by the Military Foot Police in 1885. Although technically two independent corps, they effectively functioned as a single organisation. In 1926, they were fully amalgamated to form the Corps of Military Police (CMP). In recognition of their service in the Second World War, they became the Corps of Royal Military Police on 28 November 1946. In 1992, the RMP amalgamated into the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps (AGC), where they form part of the AGC&#x27;s Provost Branch.

Non-commissioned members of the RMP receive their basic training as soldiers at the Army Training Centre in Pirbright. They then receive further training at the Defence School of Policing and Guarding (DSPG), previously known as the Defence College of Policing and Guarding (DCPG). 

The regimental march of the RMP is &quot;The Watchtower&quot; or &quot;Hoch Heidecksburg&quot;, originally a German Army marching tune from 1912 by Rudolf Herzer. The RMP motto is &quot;Exemplo ducemus&quot;, Latin for &quot;By example shall we lead&quot;.

==History==
The Provost Marshal is a post which goes back to the 13th century and was originally an under-officer of the Earl Marshal. In 1685 the role of Provost Marshal General became a permanent post. The Cavalry Staff Corps of 1813–14 and 1815–18 is regarded as Britain&#x27;s first standing military police force and a forerunner of the Royal Military Police. The Military Mounted Police was formed in 1877 and the Military Foot Police was formed in 1885.

During the First World War the Military Police grew from 508 all ranks to over 25,000 all ranks by the end of the War. During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 the Military Police served the Army as a whole, rather than individual units.

On 27 February 1926 the Corps of Military Police was formed by merging the Military Mounted Police and the Military Foot Police.

During the Second World War the Military Police grew from 4,121 all ranks to over 50,000 all ranks within six major branches of specialists:
* Special Investigation Branch – formed in 1940, with 19 detectives from the Metropolitan Police transferred to the Army for deployment in France. From this small beginning the Branch expanded into numerous Sections which were deployed both in the UK and overseas, providing the Corps with its own Criminal Investigation Department to conduct more detailed and protracted investigations into organised crime and serious offences such as murder.
* Provost Wing – responsible for general policing. Provost Companies were included in the order of battle of Home Commands, Armoured, Infantry and Airborne Divisions, as well as at Army and Corps level and with independent Brigades. From 1942, &quot;Ports Provost&quot; Companies were raised, consisting of a mix of Provost and Vulnerable Points Sections, which were deployed on security and policing duties within ports and docks.
* Vulnerable Points Wing – formed in 1941 to provide security of static locations and establishments. They were known as &quot;blue caps&quot; from the Oxford blue cloth covers worn on their service dress caps. Originally intended to act as static Companies and detachments, VP Coys were later deployed in North West Europe, guarding prisoner of war camps and other static installations. The VP Wing was quickly phased out at the end of the war, but re-appeared briefly in the Supplementary Reserve/Army Emergency Reserve between 1950 and 1961.
* Traffic Control Wing – formed in 1941, TC Coys were deployed throughout the United Kingdom, releasing Provost Companies from the tasks of traffic control. TC Coys were later deployed in the Middle East, Italy and North-West Europe. The Wing was phased out of the Corps by 1946.
* Field Security Wing – formed in 1937. Personnel wore Lincoln green cap covers, green brassards and brass shoulder titles on their tunics with the letters &quot;FSP&quot;, to distinguish them from the rest of the Corps. They wore the standard CMP cap badge, but unofficially ground down the wording &quot;MILITARY POLICE&quot; from the lower scroll of the badge. In July 1940 the Wing was absorbed into the new Intelligence Corps.

In November 1946, King George VI granted the &#x27;Royal&#x27; prefix to the Corps of Military Police in recognition of its outstanding record in two World Wars and the Corps became known as The Corps of Royal Military Police, though abbreviated to Royal Military Police (RMP). From 1969 the Corps made an important contribution during The Troubles in Northern Ireland.
A horse detachment of the Royal Military Police remained in service after World War II, being recreated in 1950. Based at Aldershot, its purpose was mainly to undertake patrol and other policing duties in areas not suitable for vehicles, but also to act as a ceremonial unit preserving mounted RMP traditions dating back to the nineteenth century. The Mounted Troop was gradually reduced to about 20 personnel and finally disbanded in 1995.

On 6 April 1992 the RMP amalgamated into the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps (AGC), under whose overall command they form part of the AGC&#x27;s Provost Branch alongside the also pre-existent Military Provost Staff Corps and the later-formed Military Provost Guard Service. Although they lost status as an independent corps, they were permitted to retain the Royal Military Police title and cap badge.

==Role==
As well as policing service personnel whilst at home in the UK, the Royal Military Police are required to provide a capable military police presence in support of military operations overseas.

===In the United Kingdom and British overseas garrisons===
Broadly speaking, within the United Kingdom and its overseas garrisons, the Royal Military Police are responsible for policing service personnel. In garrison towns, the RMP often assist the local territorial police force in town centres at venues where service personnel are likely to frequent. Some Royal Military Police NCOs are allocated roles working on Service Family Accommodation (SFA) estates, such as Community Liaison Officers and Crime Reduction Officers. Part of this role involves visiting schools in the SFA catchment area, where the school&#x27;s children come from service families. In the UK, this work is often done in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence Police.

Some of the specific roles the RMP fulfill include:
* Law enforcement and crime prevention, within the service community
* Assistance to civilian police forces in garrison towns

===When deployed on operations===

The Royal Military Police are required to provide tactical military police support to the British Army in military operations. When deployed, some of the roles the RMP fulfill include:
* War crime investigations
* Handling and collating criminal evidence
* Reconnaissance patrols
* Detainee handling
* Search operations
* General policing duties within operational bases
* Foreign police and military training
* Provide close protection operatives for senior military and diplomatic personnel on operations

==Jurisdiction==

===In the United Kingdom===
Royal Military Police personnel are not constables under UK law and do not have any specific police powers over the general public, only whilst dealing with service personnel. The RMP are subject to inspection by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, in the same way as UK civilian police forces.

RMP personnel sometimes have powers, conferred by military lands byelaws, to give lawful directions to civilians who are on Ministry of Defence land affected by such byelaws. This may include the power to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic, close or restrict access, or to direct civilians to leave military land to which the byelaws apply. The particulars of these powers are highly changeable and are determined by each individual statutory instrument.

A member of the Royal Military Police can arrest any individual in the UK whom they have reasonable grounds to believe to be a serving member of HM Armed Forces and to have committed a relevant civil or military law offence. RMP personnel do not have to be on Ministry of Defence land to exercise their authority over service personnel. The RMP also have police powers over personnel of the other two branches of the armed forces: the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. The Royal Navy Police and RAF Police also have reciprocal police powers over British Army personnel.

===Postings overseas===
Where service personnel are deployed overseas, the Royal Military Police are often called upon to provide a complete policing service. In these situations, members of the Royal Military Police can often exercise police powers in respect of civilians subject to service discipline. This includes, not exclusively, service dependents and overseas contractors sponsored by the British Army.

In Germany, under the Status of forces agreement, the RMP has jurisdiction and primacy over British service personnel, their families, MoD contractors, and NAAFI staff. The German civil police only normally become involved where the interests of a German national are concerned.

==Equipment==
Royal Military Police personnel undertaking general police duties are equipped with extendable batons, Hiatt speedcuffs and Airwave personal radios.

The RMP also uses the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, known as HOLMES.

==Training==

RMP commissioned officers attend the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, as do all other British Army officers. Other ranks recruits undertake their phase 1, Common Military Syllabus (Recruits) training at the Army Training Regiment in Winchester. They then move onto Phase 2 which is undertaken at the Defence School of Policing and Guarding.

The training syllabus includes:
* Service Police Codes Of Practice (SPCOP), military legislation which shadows Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)
* Armed Forces Act 2006 (also Status of Forces in NATO)
* Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA 2005)
* Geneva Conventions
* HAIG Rules
* Personal Safety Training (PST)

==Organisation==
The regimental headquarters of the RMP moved to MOD Southwick Park - Southwick House - near Portsmouth, in February 2007. It is co-located with the triservice Defence School of Policing and Guarding. The RMP training centre moved there on 27 September 2005, from the RMP&#x27;s long-standing RHQ (with effect from February, 1964) at Roussillon Barracks in Chichester, West Sussex. The Service Police Crime Bureau is also located at MOD Southwick Park, and is staffed by personnel from the Royal Military Police, Royal Air Force Police, and Royal Navy Police. The RMP Museum has also moved to MOD Southwick Park.

<text>Cesar Pietersz, or Cesar Boetius van Everdingen (1616/17 – buried 13 October 1678), older brother of Allart van Everdingen and Jan van Everdingen, was a Dutch Golden Age portrait and history painter.

==Biography==


He was born in Alkmaar and educated in Utrecht, where he learned to paint from Jan Gerritsz van Bronckhorst. Caesar became a member of the painter&#x27;s guild in Alkmaar in 1632. His first known painting dates from 1636. In 1648 he moved to Haarlem, where he joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke and the civic guard (or &quot;schutterij&quot;) there, where he met Jacob van Campen. From 1648 to 1650 He helped him with the decoration of the &quot;Oranje Zaal&quot; (Orange room) in Huis ten Bosch. In 1658 he moved back to Alkmaar where he started a workshop and took on pupils. He died and was buried in the Grote- or St. Laurenskerk in Alkmaar.

==Works==
Many of his pictures are to be seen in the museums and private houses of the Netherlands, with several on display at the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. His pupils were Jan Theunisz Blanckerhoff, Adriaen Dekker, Hendrik Graauw, and Thomas Heeremans. Houbraken also lists two other pupils; Adriaen Warmenhuizen, and Laurens Oosthoorn. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid owns a Vertumnus and Pomona .

<doc id="840123" wikidata="Q8017062" url="?curid=840123" title="William Preston (Freemason)">
<text>William Preston (7 August 1742 – 1 April 1818) was a Scottish author, editor and lecturer, born in Edinburgh. After attending school and college he became secretary to the linguist Thomas Ruddiman, who became his guardian on the death of his father. On the death of Thomas, Preston became a printer for Walter Ruddiman, Thomas&#x27; brother. In 1760 he moved to London and started a distinguished career with the printer William Strahan. He became a Freemason, instituting a system of lectures of instruction, and publishing &quot;Illustrations of Masonry&quot;, which ran to several editions. It was under Preston that the Lodge of Antiquity seceded from the Moderns Grand Lodge to become &quot;The Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent&quot; for ten years. He died on 1 April 1818, after a long illness, and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Early life==

Preston was a born in Edinburgh, on 7 August 1742. His father, also William Preston, was a Writer to the Signet, a form of solicitor. His second, and only surviving child, was encouraged in Classical studies, entering the Royal High School, Edinburgh at six, where he shone in Latin, and would also have studied Greek. He continued his classical studies at college, before becoming secretary to Thomas Ruddiman, a classical scholar whose blindness now necessitated such help. Meanwhile, Preston senior&#x27;s health and fortunes declined, due to bad investments and supporting the wrong side in the 1745 rebellion. On his death, in 1751, Ruddiman became young William&#x27;s guardian. He was apprenticed to the printer, Walter Ruddiman, Thomas&#x27; brother, but until Thomas&#x27; death in 1757 spent most of his time reading to him, and transcribing and copy-editing his work.

In 1760, furnished with letters of introduction by Ruddiman, Preston arrived in London, where he took employment with William Strahan, later to become the King&#x27;s Printer, and a former pupil of the same school as Preston. Here he would spend his professional life as an editor, earning the respect of writers such as David Hume and Edward Gibbon.

==Freemasonry==
Shortly after Preston&#x27;s arrival in London, a group of Edinburgh Freemasons living in the English capital decided to form themselves into a lodge. The Grand Lodge of Scotland felt they could not grant them a constitution, as they recognised the jurisdiction of the Antients&#x27; Grand Lodge in the capital. They were accordingly constituted as Lodge no. 111 at the &quot;White Hart&quot; in the Strand on 20 April 1763. It may have been at this meeting that Preston became their second initiate. Unhappy with the status of the relatively new Grand Lodge which they found themselves part of, Preston and some others began attending a lodge attached to the original Grand Lodge of England, and persuaded their brethren to change allegiance. Accordingly, on 15 November 1764, Lodge no 111 of the Antients became Caledonian Lodge no 325 (now 134), under a constitution which was just starting to be known as the &quot;Moderns&quot;; that lodge later held its meetings at the Great Eastern Hotel on Liverpool Street in London. Antient/ancient and Modern referred to the ritual used by the respective constitutions, not to the age of the Grand Lodges. The shift of allegiance occasioned some vitriolic correspondence between Caledonian Lodge and their former Grand Lodge. Caledonian Lodge then became the major component in the first Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masonry.
Preston soon began an extensive program of masonic research. Interviewing where he could, and entering into an extensive correspondence with Freemasons in Britain and overseas, he built a vast storehouse of masonic knowledge, which he applied initially to explaining and organising the lectures attached to the three degrees of Freemasonry. He met with friends once or twice a week to test and refine his presentation, and on 21 May 1772 he organised a Gala at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand at his own considerable expense, to introduce the Grand Officers and other prominent masons to his system. The success of his oration on that day led to the publication, later that year, of his &quot;Illustrations of Masonry&quot;, which ran to twelve English editions in the authors lifetime, as well as being translated into other languages. In 1774 he organised his material into lecture courses, delivered by him at the Mitre Tavern, Fleet Street. There were twelve lectures per degree, at one guinea per degree.

Present at the Gala were two members of the Lodge of Antiquity (once, as the Goose and Gridiron, a founder of the Grand Lodge). John Bottomley was then the Master, and John Noorthouck a colleague of Preston at Strahan&#x27;s printing firm. Antiquity was suffering from declining membership, and these two men conceived the idea of reviving their lodge by recruiting Preston. He was elected a member, &quot;in absentia&quot;, on 1 June 1774. On his first attendance as a member, a fortnight later, he was elected Master of the lodge. The lodge accordingly flourished, which somehow displeased Bro Noorthouck. He complained that the younger masons who now flocked to the lodge were all Preston&#x27;s creatures, which had enabled him to stay in the chair for three and a half years.

During this period, commencing in 1769, Preston became the Assistant Grand Secretary, and &quot;Printer to the Society&quot;. This gave him access to material which he subsequently used in &quot;Illustrations of Masonry&quot;. It also gave him the opportunity to attempt to drive a wedge between the Antients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, by challenging the basis on which the younger Grand Lodge was formed. The attempt failed, and only served to widen the division between the two Grand Lodges.

==Schism from Grand Lodge==

On 27 December 1777, some members of the Lodge of Antiquity, including Preston, returned from church wearing their masonic regalia. This amounted to little more than crossing the road. Certain of the original members of Antiquity who were not present (and who included the two men who had persuaded Preston to join Antiquity) chose to report the incident to Grand Lodge as a proscribed Masonic procession. Instead of playing down the occasion, Preston chose to defend the actions of himself and his brethren by emphasising the seniority of his own lodge. As the Goose and Gridiron, Antiquity had been one of the founders of Grand Lodge. Preston argued that his lodge had only subscribed to the original constitutions, and subsequent rulings did not apply to them. After due process, Preston and his supporters were expelled in 1779. This split Antiquity. The longer standing members stayed with the Moderns. The rest of the lodge allied itself with the Grand Lodge of All England at York, becoming for the period of their separation, &quot;the Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent&quot;, warranting at least two lodges in its own right. In May 1789 the dispute was resolved, Preston, after an apology, was welcomed back to his Masonic Honours at a dinner, and the two-halves of the Lodge of Antiquity were re-united in 1790.

==Legacy==

Preston&#x27;s expulsion from Grand Lodge signaled a great reduction in his contribution to Freemasonry. He had been absent from lodge for a year when he resigned in 1781. His brethren persuaded him to return five years later, which halted another period of decline. He claimed to have warranted several lodges in his period of exile in a rebel grand lodge, but only two have been verified. About the time of his re-admission to the Moderns, he founded the Order (or Grand Chapter) of Harodim, which was a vehicle for his own ideas about masonry as expressed in his lectures. This died out in about 1800. Preston took no part, and passed no public comment, in the long process of unification of the two Grand Lodges. His major masonic legacy must be considered to be his &quot;Illustrations of Masonry&quot;, which continued to new editions after his death, after a long illness, in 1818.

While Preston is remembered as a masonic scholar, few modern masons have read his work. His history of freemasonry is every bit as far fetched as Anderson&#x27;s, although it starts far later with Athelstan, and his lectures and explanations must be read as a work of its time, relating the Freemasonry of the late Eighteenth century to the people of that time. Preston&#x27;s lasting impact is in drawing the perception of Freemasonry away from the bar and the dining table, and giving it a more cerebral appeal. Preston is also associated, with Grand Secretary James Heseltine and Thomas Dunckerley, with the movement of Masonic meetings from taverns into dedicated Masonic buildings.

<text>Mad About Boys was a monthly magazine in the United Kingdom aimed at girls aged between nine and twelve. First launched in January 2001 by Planet Three Publishing, it attracted controversy over what many saw as adult content, and was banned from many chain stores, including Woolworths and WH Smith. It ceased publication after four issues due to poor sales.

The editor of the magazine, Maria Landolfi, told &quot;PR Week&quot;: &quot;Our USP is that we feature 12 teen boys aged 13 to 17 and get our readers to vote for the &#x27;boy of the month&#x27; by post or on our website&quot;.

<text>Junius Spencer Morgan I (April 14, 1813 – April 8, 1890) was an American banker and financier, as well as the father of John Pierpont &quot;J.P.&quot; Morgan and patriarch to the Morgan banking house.

In 1864, he established J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. in London as the successor to George Peabody &amp; Co., of which he was junior partner. With his son&#x27;s aid, Morgan grew his banking house into a trans-Atlantic financial empire that included firms in London, New York City, Philadelphia, and Paris. By the time of his death in 1890, the Morgan banks were dominant forces in government and railroad finance, and his was the pre-eminent American banking house.

==Early life==
Morgan was born on April 14, 1813, in Holyoke, Massachusetts to Joseph and Sarah Morgan.

At the age of 13, he was enrolled at the American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy (now Norwich University) in Middletown, Connecticut near the home of his mother&#x27;s parents. After a year, he transferred to a private academy in East Windsor, Connecticut and spent summers working on his father&#x27;s farm or assisting at his father&#x27;s business office in Hartford.

As was typical for aspiring businessmen of the time, Junius did not enroll in college, but was apprenticed to Alfred Welles, a Boston merchant banker, in 1829. He remained as a clerk for five years, gaining exposure to the banking industry, as well as a number of mercantile trades in Boston and New York.

===Family===
The Morgan name is traced to Carmarthen, Wales, with his earliest known ancestor being Hyfaidd ap Bleddri, third son of Bledri ap Cydifor of Wales. Miles Morgan, ancestor to the Morgan family in America, emigrated from Bristol, England to Boston in 1636.

Junius&#x27;s father Joseph was a soldier in the Revolutionary Army and farmer in West Springfield, Massachusetts. He entered business in Connecticut, operating a tavern, coffee house, and stagecoach line, and was a founding partner in the Aetna Fire Insurance Company in 1819. He made a fortune with Aetna in 1835, when Aetna covered Wall Street firms destroyed in the Great Fire of New York. Joseph personally bought the stakes of Aetna investors who hesitated to pay on the policies. These prompt payments to the banks destroyed in the fire established Aetna&#x27;s reputation on Wall Street and allowed the firm to triple its premiums in later years.

==Early career==
In April 1833, Alfred Welles offered Morgan a partnership in his firm; he accepted against his father&#x27;s wishes. Within a year, the business struggled sufficiently that Joseph Morgan had to bail his son out and dissolve the partnership.

Soon thereafter, Morgan&#x27;s father secured him a new partnership at Morris Ketchum&#x27;s private bank on Wall Street, renamed Morgan Ketchum &amp; Co. The firm did a general banking and brokerage business and had a few foreign clients.

===Howe Mather &amp; Co.===
In January 1836, Morgan&#x27;s father bought him a partnership in the Hartford wholesale dry goods house of Howe Mather &amp; Co., the largest in Hartford. He remained at the firm until his father&#x27;s death in 1847.

During the Panic of 1837, Morgan traveled the South in an effort to collect the firm&#x27;s debts, in specie if possible but often in payments of cotton. He continued traveling to collect debts and purchase cotton through the ongoing depression into the 1840s, continuing to grow his reputation as a businessman in Hartford. In 1845, his father invested an additional $25,000 in the firm on Junius&#x27;s behalf.

Soon after inheriting a fortune from his father&#x27;s estate in 1847, Morgan was named senior partner at the rechristened Mather Morgan &amp; Co. In 1850, he took a trip to London to meet with some of that city&#x27;s leading merchant bankers, in hopes that he might expand his own firm into foreign trade and banking.

===J. M. Beebe, Morgan &amp; Co.===
In fall 1850, Morgan arranged to go into business with James M. Beebe of Boston, a young merchant with a growing import business. One of the firm&#x27;s two junior partners was future Governor of New York and U.S. Vice President Levi P. Morton.

By February 1851, Morgan sold his stake in Howe &amp; Mather for $600,000 and moved to Boston&#x27;s Pemberton Square. He was soon among the nation&#x27;s financial elite. The firm gave Morgan access to global markets, exporting and financing cotton and other goods shipped from Boston harbor.

===Peabody &amp; Co.===

On May 15, 1853, at the recommendation of James Beebe, Morgan visited the American banker George Peabody in London. Peabody, who was in poor health, offered Morgan to join his banking house as a junior partner, to be made the senior partner upon Peabody&#x27;s retirement in ten years. Peabody pledged the bank could continue to use his name and if necessary, some capital. Morgan demurred but eventually accepted, joining the firm as junior partner in October 1854.

Morgan&#x27;s initial task was to strengthen and develop the firm&#x27;s principal American accounts, using his first-hand knowledge of and connections to American business which Peabody, who had moved to London in 1836, lacked. Morgan spent his first few months working for Peabody in the United States, establishing contacts with American clients like Duncan, Sherman &amp; Company, reaching out to new potential clients, and gathering information. During this period, Morgan first met Francis M. Drexel, founder of Drexel &amp; Company, one of Philadelphia&#x27;s leading banks. Drexel allied his bank with Peabody&#x27;s through Morgan, forming one of the most powerful and important banking alliances in American history.

Upon Morgan&#x27;s arrival in London in 1854, Peabody &amp; Co. was immediately in a position of strength as a leading dealer in American securities in the city; American grain, cotton, and railroad values soared during and after the Crimean War. Morgan was placed in charge of much of the firm&#x27;s iron portfolio, which included the marketing of railroad bonds in both New York and London. The iron business had drawn the firm into greater involvement in financing American railway construction, including as the initial offeror of bonds for the Ohio and Mississippi Rail Road Company in 1853. Built around a core of booming American railway securities, the firm established itself in several other markets, including the New York money market and government finance.

By 1856, Peabody was confident enough in Morgan to leave him in sole care of the business while Peabody took an extended tour of the United States.

====Panic of 1857====
The railway boom ended in 1857 and prices collapsed, leading to rumors in London that Peabody &amp; Co. was on the verge of failure. Some of Peabody&#x27;s largest clients suspended business or failed entirely, and Duncan Sherman was unable to pay its remittances without assistance. Some of Peabody&#x27;s own creditors, including rival Barings Bank, demanded immediate payment on their debts.

Peabody declined a conditional bailout from the major London houses which would have closed the firm, instead receiving an emergency line of credit of £800,000 from the Bank of England. After the panic and near collapse of Peabody &amp; Co., Morgan became a more cautious investor, demanding statements from all correspondent banks, even at the risk of offending them and even from well-respected former colleagues.

Despite their own financial difficulties in this period, Peabody and Morgan were chief backers of Cyrus West Field&#x27;s bedeviled transatlantic cable project throughout. Morgan personally lobbied Washington on Field&#x27;s behalf in 1856 and Peabody &amp; Co. subscribed to £10,000 of Field&#x27;s original capital stock of £350,000 and later advanced Field funds to complete the project when he struggled to find American investors. In October 1858, Field&#x27;s cable broke, delaying the project&#x27;s completion another eight years until 1866. Throughout, Morgan and Peabody maintained their confidence in Field&#x27;s project. The firm turned an eventual profit on the venture, but its major purpose was to establish Morgan as a primary backer in the growing communications industry.

====American Civil War====
Morgan became the active head of the firm in February 1859, with Peabody remaining the nominal senior partner. He took on a prominent role in London society, hosting many social gatherings at his homes on Hyde Park and at Roehampton.

Though Peabody &amp; Co. made a significant investment in the Transatlantic cotton trade, its principal business was still with correspondent banks in the Eastern United States and with railroad companies. It was therefore not as directly reliant on American slavery as its peer banks in London, and took advantage during the American Civil War by aligning with the Union.

After the Civil War broke out, Morgan traded Union war bonds at a tremendous profit. Working with his son John Pierpont in New York, Morgan was able to receive news of the fall of Vicksburg via telegraph before it became general knowledge in London, buying up Union bonds before their prices rose. Even so, the bank&#x27;s position in London may have prevented further profits; buying Union war bonds risked alienating the English textile industry, which was closely aligned with Confederate cotton plantations. While Philadelphia banker Jay Cooke and those Wall Street banks with German ties made a bonanza during the war, Peabody &amp; Co. had modest profits by comparison.

==J. S. Morgan &amp; Co.==

In 1864, Morgan&#x27;s ten-year agreement with Peabody expired. Though Peabody retired as promised, he denied Morgan the use of his name and capital. Morgan&#x27;s grandson later recalled this as &quot;at that time, the bitterest disappointment of his life&quot;. Peabody also forced unfavorable terms on Morgan&#x27;s lease of the bank&#x27;s 22 Old Broad Street offices. Morgan succeeded Peabody as head of the firm and reluctantly changed its name to J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. Despite his disappointment, J. S. Morgan was the largest American bank in London and had earned £444,000 in the prior ten years, leaving Morgan a powerful platform for future investments.
Still, Morgan was ambitious to place his bank on par with the Rothschilds and Barings Bank. In 1870, after the Battle of Sedan and the establishment of a provisional French Third Republic in Tours, Barings and Rothschilds were unwilling to establish a line of credit for the new government. Morgan led a syndicated bond issue of £10,000,000, which the syndicate sold at 15 points below par. After the fall of Paris in January and the establishment of the Paris Commune, the bonds dropped from 80 points to 55, nearly bankrupting J.S. Morgan &amp; Co. Morgan sought to prop up the price by purchasing as many bonds as he could. The French prepaid the bonds in 1873, following the war, which brought their value up to par and netted Morgan £1,500,000 profit, which propelled J.S. Morgan &amp; Co. into the upper ranks of international finance.

Another windfall arrived at Morgan&#x27;s doorstep that same year when Philadelphia&#x27;s Anthony Drexel proposed an affiliation with J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. Drexel was then Philadelphia&#x27;s second power in government finance after Jay Cooke. This proposal was accepted and Drexel, Morgan, &amp; Co. became the new New York affiliate of the London bank, with Pierpont as Drexel&#x27;s junior partner. Pierpont also joined Drexel&#x27;s Philadelphia firm and his Paris firm, giving the Morgans footholds in four cities.

Morgan was now the wealthiest American banker in London and moved into a Knightsbridge mansion facing the south side of Hyde Park. He also purchased Dover House in Roehampton.

In 1873, Morgan&#x27;s American presence dramatically increased after the failure of Jay Cooke&#x27;s banking empire. When American grain (and consequently rail) prices fell dramatically after the resolution of the Franco-Prussian War, Cooke&#x27;s heavy investment in the Northern Pacific Railway was no longer sufficient to meet liabilities. Railroad securities were further weakened by the Credit Mobilier scandal. Cooke&#x27;s firm collapsed on September 18, triggering a wave of bank failures as part of the Panic of 1873. Despite the conditions, Pierpont turned the firm a profit of over $1,000,000, leaving Drexel Morgan at the apex of American government finance.

===Reduced role===
In 1877, Morgan began a semiretirement, cutting back on his schedule and ceding greater authority to his son. On November 8, a dinner was hosted in his honor at Delmonico&#x27;s, with Samuel Tilden, John Jacob Astor, and Theodore Roosevelt Sr. among the guests. At the dinner, Morgan stated:

...never do anything to cause evil to be spoken of the American name.

As Junius took a less active role and Pierpont continued to accrue massive profits, the balance of power within the Morgan empire shifted from London to New York City. By the 1880s, Junius&#x27;s health began to fade, and he stepped back from day-to-day business. After the death of his wife Juliet in 1884, he withdrew further from business. He spent winters at the Villa Henriette in Monte Carlo.

==Personal life==
===Appearance and demeanor===
Morgan was &quot;tall with sloping shoulders&quot; and a thickening midriff, a wide face, light blue eyes, a prominent nose, and a firm mouth.

Morgan was, like his son, intensely private. He had a &quot;dry wit and genial manner and employed iron discipline.&quot; He was generally emotionless, and his friend George Smalley praised his &quot;grave, strong beauty&quot; and his &quot;eyes full of light&quot; but a face that ended in an &quot;immovable jaw.&quot;

===Family===

In 1836, Morgan married Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884), daughter of John Pierpont (1785–1866), a poet, lawyer, merchant, and Unitarian minister. Together, they had:

* John Pierpont Morgan (1837–1913), who married Amelia Sturges (1835–1862), and later, Frances Louise Tracy (1842–1924)
* Sarah Spencer Morgan (1839–1896), who married George Hale Morgan (1840–1911)
* Mary Lyman Morgan (1844–1919), who married Walter Hayes Burns (1838–1897). Their daughter, Mary Ethel Burns (d. 1961) married Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt (1863–1922) in 1899.
* Junius Spencer Morgan Jr (1846–1850), who died young
* Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1847–1923), who was the mother of John Junius Morgan (d. 1952).

Morgan poured tremendous effort into his son and heir J. Pierpont. After Junius&#x27;s move to London, Pierpont was his father&#x27;s primary source of intelligence on American conditions. Their relationship, though separated by an ocean and wildly divergent personalities, was close. Each fall, Junius made an annual trip to the United States for three months, and Pierpont traveled to London each spring. They maintained a twice-weekly correspondence for thirty-one years, which Pierpont burned in 1911.

His sister, Lucy Morgan (d. 1890) was married to Major James Goodwin, one of the founders, and a president for many years, of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company. Lucy was the mother of James J. Goodwin and the Rev. Francis Goodwin, chairman of the Hartford Parks Commission.

He was not related to Edwin D. Morgan, a prominent Hartford and New York banker and merchant of the same era who became Governor of New York.

He contributed money to the Hartford Free Library, his church and to Trinity College, Hartford.

===Politics===
Like his father, Morgan was a strong supporter of the Whig Party. Morgan was a close friend of the Whig politician and diplomat Abbott Lawrence.

In February 1842, his father-in-law John Pierpont was suggested as a leading candidate for the Liberty Party nomination for Governor of Massachusetts. Morgan urged Pierpont to withdraw his name from consideration, and he did.

===Religion===
Though married in his father-in-law&#x27;s Unitarian church, Morgan attended his own father&#x27;s Episcopal church in Hartford.

==Death and burial==
On April 3, 1890, Morgan took an afternoon carriage ride through Monte Carlo. When his horses bolted at an oncoming train, Morgan stood to see if his driver could steady the horses. The carriage hit a pile of stone and Morgan was thrown against the wall. He suffered a broken wrist and concussion and was unconscious for five days until his death on April 8, 1890.

At his funeral, the pallbearers were Roland Mather, Levi P. Morton, Anthony Joseph Drexel, Chauncey M. Depew, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, J. C. Rogers, J. Kearney Warren, and Edward John Phelps. He was interred at the family lot in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. At the Connecticut State Capitol, flags were flown at half-mast in mourning.

At his death, he left a fortune of $12,400,000 (equivalent to $ today).

<text>Justin Morgan (February 28, 1747 – March 22, 1798) was a U.S. horse breeder and composer.

He was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts, and by 1788 had settled in Vermont. In addition to being a horse breeder and farmer, he was a teacher of singing; in that capacity he traveled considerably throughout the northeastern states. He died in Randolph, Vermont, where he also served as town clerk.

Justin Morgan was the owner of a stallion named Figure, who became the sire of the Morgan horse breed. Morgan received Figure along with two other horses as payment of a debt. As Figure grew older, people began to recognize his skill in a variety of areas. Figure became a prolific breeding stallion; his descendants, still noted for their versatility and friendly personality, became the first American breed of horse to survive to the present. Figure&#x27;s grave is marked by a stone in Tunbridge, Vermont.

Justin Morgan&#x27;s original 1798 gravestone is preserved in the Randolph Historical Society Museum. His burial site in the Randolph Center Cemetery is marked by a more recent stone.

==Music==
Morgan was a composer, best known for his hymns and fuguing tunes. While not so famous as those by William Billings, his works share the same characteristic roughness, directness, and folk-like simplicity.

Publications containing his work include &quot;The Federal Harmony&quot; (New Haven, 1790), and &quot;The Philadelphia Harmony&quot;, 4th ed. (Philadelphia, 1791). The former collection includes what perhaps is his most famous composition entitled, &quot;Amanda,&quot; a setting of Isaac Watts&#x27;s poem based on Psalm 90. This hymn was the basis for a classical work written by American composer Thomas Canning in 1946, &quot;Fantasy on a Hymn Tune by Justin Morgan.&quot; The tune &quot;Despair,&quot; in the 1791 collection, cites the death of &quot;Amanda&quot; (referring to his wife, Martha Day, who died on March 20 that year, ten days after giving birth to their youngest daughter, Polly) in a paraphrase of Alexander Pope&#x27;s Ode on Solitude.

Morgan&#x27;s setting of Psalm 63, entitled &quot;Montgomery&quot;, was a popular fuguing tune, included among the 100 hymn-tunes most frequently printed during the eighteenth century. Four of his tunes, including &quot;Montgomery&quot;, are in the 1991 edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;; three more songs, including &quot;Amanda&quot; and &quot;Despair,&quot; both grieving over the death of his wife, are in the Shenandoah Harmony. Its voice-leading, as is common in works by early American composers, contains numerous unabashed parallel fifths, giving the music a folk-like quality. Another work of his, the &quot;Judgment Anthem&quot;, is tonally adventurous, moving back and forth between E minor and E♭ major; it was the first anthem published in shape notes, appearing in Little and Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Easy Instructor&quot; (1801), and many tunebooks thereafter.

==In literature==
Morgan and his horse-breeding venture is the subject of a children&#x27;s book by Marguerite Henry, &quot;Justin Morgan Had a Horse&quot;, that won the Newbery Honor in 1946. In 1972, the book was adapted as a film by Disney Studios.

<text>Oskar Morgenstern (; January 24, 1902 – July 26, 1977) was a German-born economist. In collaboration with mathematician John von Neumann, he founded the mathematical field of game theory as applied to the social sciences and strategic decision-making, as well as making major contributions to decision theory (see von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem).

Companies of which he served as founder or co-founder included Market Research Corporation of America and the original Mathematica Inc.

== Biography ==
Morgenstern was born in Görlitz in the Prussian Province of Silesia. His mother was said to be a daughter of Emperor Frederick III of Germany.

Morgenstern grew up in Vienna, Austria, where he also went to university. In 1925, he graduated from the University of Vienna and got his PhD in political science. From 1925 until 1928, he went on a three-year fellowship financed by the Rockefeller Foundation. After his return in 1928, he became a professor in economics at the University of Vienna until his visit to Princeton University in 1938. In 1935, Morgenstern published the article &quot;Perfect Foresight and Economic Equilibrium&quot;, after which his colleague Eduard Čech pointed him to an article of John von Neumann, &quot;Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele&quot; (1928). He also worked as an outside expert for the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations, together with Bertil Ohlin and Jacques Rueff, supporting the EFO&#x27;s work on economic depressions in the late 1930s.

During Morgenstern&#x27;s visit to Princeton University, Adolf Hitler took over Vienna during the Anschluss, and Morgenstern decided to remain in the United States. He became a member of the faculty at Princeton but gravitated toward the Institute for Advanced Study. There, he met von Neumann and they collaborated to write &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot;, published in 1944, which is recognized as the first book on game theory, a mathematical framework for the study of strategic structures which govern rational decision-making in certain economic, political, and military situations. In 2013, the University of Vienna relocated the Faculty of Business, Economics and Statistics and named the square Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz in his honor.

The collaboration between economist Morgenstern and mathematician von Neumann led to the birth of entirely new areas of investigation in both mathematics and economics. These have attracted widespread academic and practical interest since that time. In 1944, Morgenstern also became a United States citizen, and four years later he married Dorothy Young, with whom he had two children, Carl and Karin. In 1950, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. Morgenstern remained at Princeton as a professor of economics until his retirement in 1970, at which time he joined the faculty of New York University. Morgenstern wrote many other articles and books, including &quot;On the Accuracy of Economic Observations&quot;, and &quot;Predictability of Stock Market Prices&quot; with subsequent Nobel laureate Clive Granger.

Morgenstern died in Princeton, New Jersey in 1977. The archive of his published works and unpublished documents is held at Duke University.

In November 2012 a place in Alsergrund, Vienna was called &quot;Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz&quot;; it is the address of the Faculties of Economics and of Mathematics of the University of Vienna.

== Mathematica ==
In the late 1950s &quot;Oskar Morgenstern and several of his
Princeton University colleagues&quot; began a &quot;small research organization.&quot;

Company names with which he, along with others, were involved as founders/co-founders included:
* Industrial Surveys Company, which later became Market Research Corporation of America

<doc id="840133" wikidata="Q913239" url="?curid=840133" title="Brian Williamson">
<text>Brian Williamson (4 September 1945 – 9 June 2004) was a Jamaican gay rights activist who co-founded the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-FLAG). He was known for being one of the earliest openly gay men in Jamaican society and one of its best known gay rights activists.

Born to an upper-middle-class family in Saint Ann Parish, Williamson initially considered a life in the Roman Catholic clergy before deciding to devote himself to the cause of gay rights in Jamaica. In the 1990s, he purchased an apartment building in the New Kingston area of Kingston, in which he established a gay nightclub, which remained open for two years despite opposition from police. In 1998, he co-founded J-FLAG with other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, soon becoming the public face of the organisation. As J-FLAG&#x27;s representative, he argued in favour of LGBT rights during appearances on Jamaican television and radio programs. This attracted great hostility within Jamaica – a country with particularly high rates of anti-gay prejudice – with J-FLAG members receiving death threats and Williamson surviving a knife attack. For a time he left Jamaica, living in Canada and England for several years, before returning to Kingston in 2002.

In June 2004, Williamson was murdered in his apartment by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden&#x27;s motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia may have played a part in the killing. Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson&#x27;s death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.

==Biography==
Williamson was born to an upper-middle-class family in the rural Saint Ann Parish. He initially considered joining the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, studying for this position in Montego Bay, but eventually decided against this. In 1979, he began to devote himself to the cause of gay rights in Jamaica, becoming the first individual to do so in such a public manner. Jamaica had a reputation for its widespread anti-gay prejudice, an attitude that pervaded public discourse at all levels of society, with a number of popular Jamaican musicians inciting violence against gay men in their lyrics.
Initially, Williamson offered his apartment in Kingston as a space in which gay Jamaicans could meet roughly every fortnight. In the early 1990s he purchased a large property on New Kingston&#x27;s gentrified Haughton Street, converting part of this building into a gay nightclub that he called Entourage. Many of those who attended the club worked in the city&#x27;s foreign embassies. Although the police tried to close it down, the club remained open for two years until Williamson was attacked by a patron carrying a knife, which was used to slash Williamson&#x27;s arm. Although same-sex sexual relations between men were and remain illegal in Jamaica, Williamson was openly gay.

Williamson and other members of Jamaica&#x27;s lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group&#x27;s foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as &quot;Perspective&quot; and &quot;Nationwide&quot; in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica&#x27;s LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.

==Murder==
Financially affluent, Williamson would often offer money or odd jobs to his acquaintances in the LGBT community. Among those whom Williamson befriended was Dwight Hayden, a closeted gay man in his mid-20s who had been a user of crack cocaine prior to 2002 and who was known locally as &quot;Dog&quot; and &quot;Swong&quot;. They met in New Kingston and Williamson helped Hayden out by purchasing newspapers which he could then sell on the streets. According to one of Williamson&#x27;s flatmates, Desmond Chambers, &quot;I have seen [Hayden] here about six times (and) anything him want, Brian give him. Brian give him money, Brian give him food and help him to purchase (newspaper) to sell on the road.&quot; On 7 June 2004 Hayden arrived at Williamson&#x27;s flat with another man, with Williamson welcoming them in and offering them bottles of Guinness. Hayden asked for money from Williamson, who agreed he would give it to him later in the evening. At this, Hayden attacked Williamson, stabbing him roughly seventy times.

Williamson&#x27;s body was discovered by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson&#x27;s bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, he opened the door and discovered Williamson&#x27;s corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson&#x27;s dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.

The scene of the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was accompanied by Williamson&#x27;s sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced not to look at the body by Williamson&#x27;s friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who were laughing and celebrating Williamson&#x27;s death. Some of the assembled people shouted out statements such as &quot;This is long overdue&quot;, &quot;Battyman he get killed&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s get them one at a time&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s what you get for sin&quot;, and &quot;Batty man fi dead!&quot; (&quot;Faggots should die!&quot;). Others sang &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot;, a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men. Rebecca Schleifer, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, had a meeting with Williamson planned for that day, and arrived at his home to find the assembled crowd; she noted that &quot;It was like a parade. They were basically partying&quot;.

===Police investigation and conviction===
Police issued a statement declaring that they were searching for two men whom Chambers had observed at Williamson&#x27;s apartment prior to his death. Corporal Devon Hugh Williams of the Constabulary Communication Network (CCN) informed press that the police suspected that the motive of the attack had been robbery, as evidence pointing to the fact that Williamson&#x27;s apartment had been ransacked and a safe removed. However, both friends of Williamson and human rights organisations suggested that – given Williamson&#x27;s status as an openly gay man – robbery might have been a secondary issue, with homophobia being the main motive behind the crime.
J-FLAG expressed its suspicion that the killing was a &quot;hate-related crime&quot;, articulating the view that Williamson had been killed because he was a publicly visible gay man.
Amnesty International urged police not to dismiss alternative possible motives. Amnesty&#x27;s Piers Bannister informed press that &quot;We do know that there&#x27;s a high level of homophobia in Jamaica, so there was a possibility that it was a hate crime. Many hate crime victims are robbed afterward. We&#x27;re not saying it wasn&#x27;t a robbery; we just want a full investigation.&quot; Schleifer publicly stated that it is &quot;really important to investigate [the crime] thoroughly. Because there are really strong indications that it might have been a homophobic attack&quot;.

On 11 June, two days after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden provided a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden&#x27;s legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.

==Reaction==
After his death, the &quot;Jamaica Observer&quot; described Williamson as &quot;Jamaica&#x27;s most prominent gay rights activist&quot;, while both the BBC and &quot;The Independent&quot; called him the country&#x27;s &quot;best-known gay rights activist&quot;, and Gary Younge of &quot;The Guardian&quot; termed him &quot;the public face of gay rights in the country&quot;.

Tony Hadn, a volunteer for J-FLAG, stated that Williamson was &quot;so courageous. He never stopped to think, &#x27;oh, I might get in trouble for this,&#x27; so in that sense he was very selfless.&quot; He was succeeded as J-FLAG&#x27;s leader by Gareth Williams, who informed press that Williamson &quot;was the only out gay person in Jamaica who had the courage to put his face on television, I was very close to him... His murder was really a traumatic loss for our community.&quot; One member of J-FLAG stated that &quot;Brian Williamson is our Martin Luther King&quot;. Four days later, J-FLAG held a memorial devoted to Williamson, which was attended by almost two hundred people; the memorial involved personal tributes, poetry slams, and lip synching to Whitney Houston songs.

On 23 June, the British LGBT rights group OutRage! held a memorial vigil outside the High Commission of Jamaica in London. OutRage! leader Peter Tatchell attended the vigil, there proclaiming that the Jamaican Prime Minister, P. J. Patterson, &quot;shares responsibility for the wave of homophobic violence, culminating in the murder of Brian Williamson&quot; because he had failed to decriminalize same-sex sexual activity and clamp down on homophobic violence in Jamaican society.
Also in attendance at the vigil were the Green Party&#x27;s London Assembly member Darren Johnson, Amnesty International&#x27;s Carol Buddd, Big Up&#x27;s Charles Anglin, UKBlackOut&#x27;s Andrew Prince, and the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group&#x27;s Barry O&#x27;Leary. The London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus attended, singing a rendition of &quot;Let My People Go&quot;.

In their 2012 study of the relationship between homophobic attitudes in Jamaica and Britain, Keon West and Miles Hewstone described Williamson&#x27;s murder as the &quot;most prominent&quot; example of an anti-gay murder on the island.

<doc id="840140" wikidata="Q1878906" url="?curid=840140" title="Greek hero cult">
<text>Hero cults were one of the most distinctive features of ancient Greek religion. In Homeric Greek, &quot;hero&quot; (, ) refers to the mortal offspring of a human and a god. By the historical period, the word came to mean specifically a &quot;dead&quot; man, venerated and propitiated at his tomb or at a designated shrine, because his fame during life or his unusual manner of death gave him power to support and protect the living. A hero was more than human but less than a god, and various kinds of minor supernatural figures came to be assimilated to the class of heroes; the distinction between a hero and a god was less than certain, especially in the case of Heracles, the most prominent, but atypical hero.

The grand ruins and tumuli (large burial mounds) remaining from the Bronze Age gave the pre-literate Greeks of the 10th century BC a sense of a once grand and now vanished age; they reflected this in the oral epic tradition, which would become famous by way of works such as the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Copious renewed offerings begin to be represented, after a hiatus, at sites like Lefkandi, even though the names of the grandly buried dead were hardly remembered. &quot;Stories began to be told to individuate the persons who were now believed to be buried in these old and imposing sites&quot;, observes Robin Lane Fox. In other words, this is a clear cut example of an origin story for Heroes and what they meant to the Ancient Greeks.

==Nature of hero cult==
Greek hero-cults were distinct from the clan-based ancestor worship from which they developed, in that as the &quot;polis&quot; evolved, they became a civic rather than familial affair, and in many cases none of the worshipers traced their descent back to the hero any longer: no shrine to a hero can be traced unbroken from Mycenaean times. Whereas the ancestor was purely local, Lewis Farnell observed, the hero might be tended in more than one locality, and he deduced that hero-cult was more deeply influenced from the epic tradition, that &quot;suggested many a name to forgotten graves&quot;, and provided even Dorians a connection to Mycenaean heroes, according to Coldstream. &quot;Coldstream believed the currency of epic would account for votives in Dorian areas, where an alien, immigrant population might otherwise be expected to show no particular reverence for Mycenaean predecessors&quot;. Large Mycenaean tholos tombs that betokened a grander past, were often the site of hero-cults. Not all heroes were even known by names.
Aside from the epic tradition, which featured the heroes alive and in action rather than as objects of &quot;cultus&quot;, the earliest written reference to hero-cult is attributed to Dracon, the Athenian lawgiver of the late seventh century BC, who prescribed that gods and local heroes should both be honoured according to ancestral custom. The custom, then, was already established, and there were multiple local heroes. The written sources emphasise the importance of heroes&#x27; tombs and the &quot;temenos&quot; or sanctuary, where chthonic rites appeased their spirits and induced them to continue to favour the people who looked to them as founders, of whom founding myths were related. In the hero&#x27;s restricted and local scope he &quot;retained the limited and partisan interests of his mortal life. He would help those who lived in the vicinity of his tomb or who belonged to the tribe of which he himself was the founder,&quot; observes Robert Parker, with the reservation that Heracles, with his pan-Hellenic scope, was again the exception.

Whitley interpreted the final stage, in which hero-cult was co-opted by the city-state as a political gesture, in the archaic aristocratic tumulus surrounded by stelae, erected by Athens to the cremated citizen-heroes of Marathon (490 BC), to whom chthonic cult was dedicated, as the offering trenches indicate.
On the other hand, Greek heroes were distinct from the Roman cult of dead emperors, because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local. For this reason hero cults were chthonic in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for Hecate and Persephone than those for Zeus and Apollo: libations in the dark hours, sacrifices that were not shared by the living.

Two exceptions to the above were Heracles and Asclepius, who might be honored as either heroes or gods, with chthonic libation or with burnt sacrifice. Heroes in cult behaved very differently from heroes in myth. They might appear indifferently as men or as snakes, and they seldom appeared unless angered. A Pythagorean saying advises not to eat food that has fallen on the floor, because &quot;it belongs to the heroes&quot;. Heroes if ignored or left unappeased could turn malicious: in a fragmentary play by Aristophanes, a chorus of anonymous heroes describe themselves as senders of lice, fever and boils.

Some of the earliest hero and heroine cults well attested by archaeological evidence in mainland Greece include the Menelaion dedicated to Menelaus and Helen at Therapne near Sparta, a shrine at Mycenae dedicated to Agamemnon and Cassandra, another at Amyklai dedicated to Alexandra, and another in Ithaca&#x27;s Polis Bay dedicated to Odysseus. These all seem to date to the 8th century BC. The cult of Pelops at Olympia dates from the Archaic period.

==Heroes and heroines==
Hero cults were offered most prominently to men, though in practice the experience of the votary was of propitiating a cluster of family figures, which included women who were wives of a hero-husband, mothers of a hero-son (Alcmene and Semele), and daughters of a hero-father. As Finley observed of the world of Odysseus, which he reads as a nostalgic eighth-century rendering of traditions from the culture of Dark Age Greece,
Penelope became a moral heroine for later generations, the embodiment of goodness and chastity, to be contrasted with the faithless, murdering Clytaemnestra, Agamemnon&#x27;s wife; but &#x27;hero&#x27; has no feminine gender in the age of heroes.

Where local cult venerated figures such as the sacrificial virgin Iphigeneia, an archaic local &quot;nymphe&quot; has been reduced to a mortal figure of legend. Other isolated female figures represented priestess-initiators of a local cult. Iconographic and epigraphal evidence marshalled by Larson combine to depict heroines as similar in kind to heroes, but in androcentric Greek culture, typically of lesser stature. This is consistent with the role that women played in not only Ancient Greece, but the ancient world as a whole — more in the shadows and service-oriented than focused on personal development and relaxation.

==Types of hero cult==
Whitley distinguishes four or five essential types of hero cult:
* Oikist cults of founders. Such cults arose in colonies in the Hellenic world in Magna Graecia and Sicily at the grave of the founder, the &quot;oikist&quot;. In the case of cults at the tombs of the recently heroised, it must be assumed that the identity of the occupant of the tomb was unequivocally known. Thucydides (V.11.1) gives the example of Brasidas at Amphipolis. Battus of Cyrene might also be mentioned. &quot;Such historical examples,&quot; Whitley warns, &quot;have clearly colored the interpretation of certain tomb cults in the Archaic period.&quot; Such Archaic sites as the heroön at Lefkandi and that close to the West Gate at Eretria cannot be distinguished by archaeological methods from family observances at tombs (tomb cults) and the cult of ancestors.
* Cults to named heroes. A number of cult sites known in Classical times were dedicated to known heroes in the Greek and modern senses, especially of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and other episodes of the Epic Cycle. Whitley makes two points here, first that the earliest &quot;heria&quot; associate the male hero with earlier and stronger &quot;female&quot; presences, and second, that figures such as Odysseus, Agamemnon and Menelaus all have strong &quot;local&quot; connections. The cults of Oedipus at Athens and Pelops at Olympia are examples.
* Cults to local heroes. Such local figures do not figure among the Panhellenic figures of epic. Examples would be Akademos and Erechtheus at Athens.
* Cults at Bronze Age tombs. These are represented archaeologically by Iron Age deposits in Mycenaean tombs, not easily interpreted. Because of the gap in time between the Bronze Age collapse and the earliest votive objects, continuity appears to be broken. A sherd from above the Grave Circle A at Mycenae is simply inscribed &quot;to the hero&quot;, and Whitley suggests that the unnamed race of the Silver Age might have been invoked. In Attica, such cults are those associated with tholos tombs at Thorikos and Menidhi.
* Oracular hero cults. Whitley does not address this group of local cults where an oracle developed, as in the case of Amphiaraus, who was swallowed up by a gaping crack in the earth. Minor cults accrued to some figures who died violent or unusual deaths, as in the case of the dead from the Battle of Marathon, and those struck by lightning, as in several attested cases in Magna Graecia.

==Tombs and tumuli==
All across Greece and sometimes into Turkey lay burial mounds. Sometimes on ancient battlefields or just in a frequently visited common area lay giant mounds of earth. Scholars call these mounds &quot;tumulus&quot;. Many wondered why people built these mounds and what greater purpose they served. One notable example is following the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The Athenians, having defeated the Persians, needed to bury their dead. 192 dead in total, they were buried on the same field on which they had died and under a giant mound. This particular mound became what is known as the Marathon Tumuli. These mounds began popping up all over Greece as a gesture of respect to the dead, and as many scholars believe, it was also a way to connect them with the earth.

Most commonly in Ancient Greece, these mounds could have had any 1 of 3 main components, composed in a staircase-like format, within the mound. This staircase like structure may have 1 or 2 steps that would help carry out various ceremonial functions as well as serve as storing places for valuable items. The first step would be used for cremation and the ashes piled in after that while the second step would hold any votives or items of sentimental value. Then the whole thing would be covered by a giant mound. In the case of the Athenian monument they also surrounded it with tall, skinny stone slabs that may read an honoring message or be dedicated to any one &#x27;hero&#x27;.

==Heroes, politics, and gods==
Much of the scholarship that has been done surrounding Heroes, Gods, and the Politics that plays a role in much of what we know about them today has all come from either written accounts or archeological findings. In fact, in many cases both types of evidence may contradict each other. Written evidence can be biased or incomplete, and archeological findings do not always tell us a definitive story. However, hero cults may be a case where they collide positively. First, despite the numerous written accounts of these heroes, hero shrines are few in number and peculiar in pattern. This is proof that the cults were widespread on Greece, with multiple cities having their own iterations of each Hero to fit their own needs.

Another way in which the Cults were used was for political propaganda and manipulation. Sparta&#x27;s propping up of many hero cults was out of recognition of the fact that their population reacted to them in such a way that would allow them to use the hero shrines as political propaganda. For example, Lewis Farnell believed that, because of the fact hero cults are often not found in a hero&#x27;s home territory, there is a greater chance that the cults were widespread and common among most Greeks. Whereas other cults may be ancestral dating back to even the 8th century.

Only Laconia has evidence of assigning its shrines to specific heroes meaning that the rest of the shrines were not to any one specific hero but allowed for worship to a hero via one shrine. Unlike the Roman beliefs it was thought that the Heroes did not ascend to the skies and be with the gods of Olympus, but rather they would go down into and become one with the earth. This impacted not only how the Greeks treated the Heroes, but thought about them in a political sense. They were respected and worshiped, but could even at times turn vicious if ignored and be the supposed cause of diseases or mishaps.

Hero cults could also be of the utmost political importance beyond propaganda too. When Cleisthenes divided the Athenians into new demes for voting, he consulted Delphi on what heroes he should name each division after. According to Herodotus, the Spartans attributed their conquest of Arcadia to their theft of the bones of Orestes from the Arcadian town of Tegea. Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus, Heracles&#x27;s name means &quot;the glory of Hera&quot;, even though he was tormented all his life by the queen of the gods. This was even truer in their cult appearances. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king Erechtheus, whom Poseidon killed for choosing Athena over him as the city&#x27;s patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the Acropolis, they invoked him as &quot;Poseidon Erechtheus&quot;.

<text>Ludolf Bakhuizen (28 December 1630 or 1632 – 7 November 1708) was a German-born Dutch painter, draughtsman, calligrapher and printmaker. He was the leading Dutch painter of maritime subjects after Willem van de Velde the Elder and Younger left for England in 1672. He also painted portraits of his family and circle of friends.

==Life==

He was born in Emden, East Frisia, and came to Amsterdam around 1650, working as a merchant&#x27;s clerk at Herengracht. He discovered so strong a genius for painting that he relinquished the business and devoted himself to art from the late 1650s, initially in pen drawings and calligraphy. He studied first under Allart van Everdingen and then under Hendrik Dubbels, two eminent masters of the time, and soon became celebrated for his sea-pieces, which often had rough seas. In 1663 he became a member of the painters guild. He was influenced by Willem van de Velde the Elder. Bakhuizen assisted Bartholomeus van der Helst in 1668. 

He was an ardent student of nature, and frequently exposed himself on the sea in an open boat in order to study the effects of storms. His compositions, which are numerous, are nearly all variations of one subject, the sea, and in a style peculiarly his own, marked by intense realism or faithful imitation of nature. He moved frequently as he married four times and lived at Haarlemmerstraat, Nes, N.Z. Voorburgwal, Rozengracht, Singel across the Doelen, and at Herengracht 193 (between Oude Leliestraat and Driekoningenstraat) which was sold in 1749. 

In his later years Bakhuizen employed his skills in etching; he also painted a few examples each of several other genres of painting, such as portraits, landscapes and genre paintings. Bakhuizen painted portraits of his large circle of friends. These are of lesser artistic value but provide an insight into his good relations with contemporary scholars and literary figures.

During his life Bakhuizen was visited by Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici in 1669 and Peter the Great in 1697; he also worked for various German princes. In 1699 he opened a gallery on the top floor of the Amsterdam town hall. After a visit to England he was buried on 12 November 1708 at Westerkerk. Their son Johannis (1683-) was mute and had to be taken care of after his mother died in 1717.

<text>Major (later Colonel) Glenn Talbot is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #61 (November 1964).

He is a close compatriot to General Thaddeus Ross and an active participant in his operations to capture or kill the Hulk. His most significant blow is discovering and informing his superiors that Bruce Banner physically transformed into the Hulk, which made the scientist a wanted fugitive. Initially, Talbot was consistently portrayed as a courageous, resourceful, and fiercely patriotic man who puts the good of his country before all else. He is romantically attracted to Betty Ross, who is in love with Bruce Banner, which adds fuel to his enmity for the Hulk. Though Talbot was mostly used as a romantic rival and general adversary for Banner, the two sometimes worked together to battle greater menaces. Eventually, the character came to be portrayed as unsympathetic in his obsession with destroying the Hulk, and was embittered by the failure of his relationship with Betty Ross.

The character has appeared in various media adaptations, including novels, video games, animated films and TV series. In the 2003 film &quot;Hulk&quot;, he was portrayed by Josh Lucas, while Adrian Pasdar portrayed him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; In the latter, he is an adversary and later begrudging ally to S.H.I.E.L.D. before becoming the show&#x27;s version of [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].

==Publication history==

Glenn Talbot was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1964 and first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #61. He was a key character in the series&#x27; long-running story arc in which Bruce Banner/Hulk is suspected of being a communist traitor, and would remain a part of the Hulk&#x27;s supporting cast long after &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; had been renamed &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Glenn Talbot was a career military man. When General Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross contacts the Pentagon to investigate Bruce Banner, Talbot is put in charge of reviewing whether or not such an investigation is merited. After two weeks studying records of Banner&#x27;s career, Talbot concludes that Ross&#x27; suspicions that Banner is a traitor are well-founded, and reports this to the Pentagon. The Pentagon responds by appointing Talbot security chief for Gamma Base, where Ross is the commanding officer. While reporting for duty to General Ross, Talbot meets the General&#x27;s daughter Betty Ross, who is in love with Banner. He is immediately attracted to her and tries to court her without losing focus on his investigation of Banner. General Ross encourages this, as he objects to Betty&#x27;s love for Banner all together, whether he was a traitor or not, because he feels that Banner is too timid emotionally and physically. Ross believes that Talbot, a military man like himself, would be a much better suitor for his daughter.

Talbot&#x27;s suspicions of Banner are heightened when, upon Talbot&#x27;s arrival at the base, the scientist mysteriously goes missing in the hills nearby. Further suspicious circumstances follow, including Banner disappearing behind the Iron Curtain for a time, but proof that Banner is a traitor continues to elude Talbot. However, when Banner disappears with the vital Absorbatron, orders are given to shoot him on sight, and the scientist is killed by a soldier. Talbot is retained as the base&#x27;s security chief, and he and Ross continue to pursue the Hulk until he, too, is seemingly killed by a barrage of nuclear weapons. At Talbot&#x27;s suggestion, the Hulk&#x27;s frequent companion Rick Jones is taken into custody to pressure him into revealing the connection between Banner and the Hulk. When Jones still refuses to talk, he is set free, and Talbot confronts him privately. Persuaded in part by the fact that the Hulk is seemingly dead, Jones confesses to Talbot that Banner and the Hulk were one and the same. Talbot realizes that Banner being the Hulk explains all his past suspicious behavior, and subsequently informs his superiors.

Subsequently, the Hulk is found still alive, and is captured using a plan devised and orchestrated by Talbot. The creature is subsequently freed by the traitor Dr. Konrad Zaxon, and Talbot twice fails to prevent Betty from being abducted by supervillains. However, he redeems himself by facing down Boomerang, preventing the villain from stealing the army&#x27;s new Orion Missile despite a shrapnel wound. He is awarded one of the nation&#x27;s highest honors for his heroism on this occasion. Despite this, he is unable to convince Betty to relinquish her feelings for Banner, and he continually hopes that the army will be forced to kill the Hulk, so that Betty will eventually forget him. He finally succeeded and married Betty all the while attempting to keep her away from Banner and the Hulk.

Talbot is taken hostage by the Gremlin, rescued some months later it was discovered that his captivity had left him catatonic. To unblock his mind, Doctor Leonard Samson had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state. The process was a success. However, Talbot&#x27;s marriage to Betty later became strained.

Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorced Betty, who later admitted to Rick Jones that she had never stopped loving Bruce Banner. Talbot continued battling the Hulk and tried to have Banner court-martialed. When General Ross had a breakdown, Talbot was promoted to Colonel. His life remained relatively uneventful until the Hulk stormed into Gamma Base, looking for his deceased love Jarella, who was still cryogenically frozen. It was revealed Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the Sub-Atomic universe. This incident was the final straw in his already deteriorated relationship with Betty. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decided once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the War Wagon.

Talbot is later killed fighting the Hulk in Japan and replaced by a Life Model Decoy, who himself is later killed by Thunderbolt Ross as the Red Hulk.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Talbot is temporarily resurrected after Death leaves the underworld.

==Family==
Since his &quot;death&quot;, two of Talbot&#x27;s relatives have also appeared. He has a younger brother named Brian Talbot who was a member of the Gamma Corps as Grey (who sports the DNA of Hulk and Leader). Trained in martial arts. The Leader DNA does not make Grey as smart as Prodigy but he has a brilliant military strategist and it seems to have been meant as a way to prevent him from losing control. Brian was often bullied and beaten by his older brother and had actually been delighted to hear of his death. He claimed he joined the Gamma Corps because the Hulk was dangerous but really it was to do what Glenn could not - destroy the Hulk.

Talbot also has a nephew named Matt Talbot, who is also a member of the military.

==Other versions==
In the alternate reality depicted in the 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Glenn Talbot is married to Betty Ross.

In &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe, a version of Talbot appeared in Ultimate Fantastic Four as General Talbot. Talbot is portrayed as a colleague and friend to General Ross, and operates in the Baxter Building&#x27;s think tank.

In the 2012 miniseries &quot;Avengers: X-Sanction&quot;, Cable initially mistakes Red Hulk for a foe of his from the future named &#x27;Talbot&#x27;, suggesting that one of Talbot&#x27;s relatives will become another Red Hulk in the future. Future versions of Wolverine and Hulk (resembling Old Man Logan and Maestro respectively) speak to the President of the United States, who resembles a Red Hulk with Talbot&#x27;s mustache.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Glenn Talbot appears in &quot;The Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, voiced by John Vernon.
* Glenn Talbot, renamed Ned Talbot, appears in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (1982), voiced by Pat Fraley. 
* Glenn Talbot appears in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (1996), voiced by Kevin Schon. This version serves as Thunderbolt Ross&#x27; right-hand man and displays a romantic interest in his daughter Betty Ross, though she always rejects him in part because of his inability to hide his disdain for Bruce Banner and the Hulk. After an encounter with the Ghost Rider, Talbot reflects on his negative personality traits and becomes more serious and selfless.
* Glenn Talbot appears in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; episode &quot;Nightmare in Red&quot;, voiced by Troy Baker. This version is a colonel and member of General Thunderbolt Ross&#x27; Hulkbusters unit.
* Glenn Talbot makes a non-speaking appearance in the &quot;Iron Man: Armored Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Rage of the Hulk&quot; as a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. under Thunderbolt Ross&#x27; command.
* Glenn Talbot appears in &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, portrayed by Adrian Pasdar. This version is initially a colonel before being promoted to brigadier general for his efforts in bringing down S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s remnants after the organization was compromised by Hydra. In the second and third seasons, he gradually forms a begrudging relationship with a rebuilt, underground S.H.I.E.L.D. led by Director Phil Coulson before becoming the head of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit (ATCU), the President&#x27;s front organization for the organization. In the fourth season episode &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;, Talbot is rendered comatose after being shot by a LMD of Daisy Johnson. He awakens in the fifth season, but suffers from sporadic emotional outbursts, and was taken into the custody of General Hale, a Hydra sleeper agent in the Air Force who subjects him to post-hypnotic brainwashing. After S.H.I.E.L.D. rescues him, his brainwashing is briefly activated and he betrays their location to Hydra. A guilt-ridden Talbot subsequently infuses himself with the gravity-manipulating substance gravitonium and kills alien warriors attacking S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s headquarters, becoming Graviton in the process. However, the gravitonium&#x27;s power exacerbates his preexisting mental instability, causing Talbot to develop extreme megalomania and a messiah complex. As a result, he forces his way into the alien Confederacy that S.H.I.E.L.D. was protecting the Earth from and uses them to find subterranean gravitonium deposits to enhance his power further and unilaterally protect the Earth from Thanos. To this end, he kills Hale and coerces the prophetic Inhuman Robin Hinton to reveal the location of a gravitonium deposit. Eventually, Talbot is killed by Johnson, who pushes him into outer space. In an alternate timeline where he was not defeated, Talbot destroyed Thanos along with most of Earth, leaving the surviving humans to be enslaved by the Kree. Due to poor retention of historical records, his name was lost to history, leading to Johnson being blamed for the apocalypse he caused.

===Film===
Glenn Talbot appears in &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003), portrayed by Josh Lucas. This version is a former military officer-turned-bio-science executive at a Defense Department contractor called Atheon. He seeks to obtain a tissue sample from the Hulk for military supersoldier-based applications, only to be injured at Banner&#x27;s house. During the Hulk&#x27;s escape from Desert Base, Talbot fires a missile at the Hulk, which ricochets off of his skin, killing Talbot in the ensuing explosion.

===Video games===
Glenn Talbot appears as a boss in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), voiced by Michael Gannon. This version views both Banner and the Hulk as threats to mankind. Later in the game, his actions against them escalate to the point where Talbot himself becomes a danger to civilian safety, with his strategies varying from attempting to launch missiles in a civilian area to destroy the Hulk to kidnapping Betty Ross and donning a nuclear-powered Hulkbuster suit to fight the Hulk directly; intending to pass off civilian casualties as the Hulk&#x27;s fault once his foe has been dealt with. When he is defeated, Talbot activates his suit&#x27;s self-destruct mechanism to kill the Hulk along with himself and an entire city. However, the Hulk throws Talbot&#x27;s suit into the upper atmosphere, where it explodes safely, killing Talbot.

===Miscellaneous===
Glenn Talbot appears in the novel &quot;The Incredible Hulk: What Savage Beast&quot;, written by Peter David. This version is the leader of the Hulkbusters.

<doc id="840147" wikidata="Q320173" url="?curid=840147" title="Exhaust gas">
<text>Exhaust gas or flue gas is emitted as a result of the combustion of fuels such as natural gas, gasoline (petrol), diesel fuel, fuel oil, biodiesel blends, or coal. According to the type of engine, it is discharged into the atmosphere through an exhaust pipe, flue gas stack, or propelling nozzle. It often disperses downwind in a pattern called an &quot;exhaust plume&quot;.

It is a major component of motor vehicle emissions (and from stationary internal combustion engines), which can also include crankcase blow-by and evaporation of unused gasoline.

Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is estimated to kill over 5 million people each year. Motor vehicle emissions are a common source of air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities. 

==Composition==
The largest part of most combustion gas is nitrogen (N2), water vapor (H2O) (except with pure-carbon fuels), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (except for fuels without carbon); these are not toxic or noxious (although water vapor and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change). A relatively small part of combustion gas is undesirable, noxious, or toxic substances, such as carbon monoxide (CO) from incomplete combustion, hydrocarbons (properly indicated as CxHy, but typically shown simply as &quot;HC&quot; on emissions-test slips) from unburnt fuel, nitrogen oxides (NOx) from excessive combustion temperatures, and particulate matter (mostly soot) from incomplete combustion.

==Exhaust gas temperature==
Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is important to the functioning of the catalytic converter of an internal combustion engine. It may be measured by an exhaust gas temperature gauge. EGT is also a measure of engine health in gas-turbine engines (see below).

==Cold engines==

During the first two minutes after starting the engine of a car that has not been operated for several hours, the amount of emissions can be very high. This occurs for two main reasons:
* Rich air-fuel ratio requirement in cold engines: When a cold engine is started, the fuel does not vaporize completely, creating higher emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, which diminishes only as the engine reaches operating temperature. The duration of this start-up phase has been reduced by advances in materials and technology, including computer-controlled fuel injection, shorter intake lengths, and pre-heating of fuel and/or inducted air.
* Inefficient catalytic converter under cold conditions: Catalytic converters are very inefficient until warmed up to their operating temperature. This time has been much reduced by moving the converter closer to the exhaust manifold and even more so placing a small yet quick-to-heat-up converter directly at the exhaust manifold. The small converter handles the start-up emissions, which allows enough time for the larger main converter to heat up. Further improvements can be realised in many ways, including electric heating, thermal battery, chemical reaction preheating, flame heating and superinsulation.

==Passenger car emissions summary==
Comparable with the European emission standards EURO III as it was applied in October 2000

In 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency began to implement more stringent emissions standards for light duty vehicles. The requirements were phased in beginning with 2004 vehicles and all new cars and light trucks were required to meet the updated standards by the end of 2007.
==Types==

===Internal-combustion engines===
====Spark-ignition and Diesel engines====
In spark-ignition engines the gases resulting from combustion of the fuel and air mix are called exhaust gases. The composition varies from petrol to diesel engines, but is around these levels:
The 10% oxygen for &quot;diesel&quot; is likely if the engine was idling, e.g. in a test rig. It is much less if the engine is running under load, although diesel engines always operate with an excess of air over fuel. 
The CO content for petrol engines varies from ≈15 ppm for well tuned engine with fuel injection and a catalytic converter up to 100,000 ppm (10%) for a richly tuned carburetor engine, such as typically found on small generators and garden equipment.

=====Nitromethane additive=====
Exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine whose fuel includes nitromethane will contain nitric acid vapour, which is corrosive, and when inhaled causes a muscular reaction making it impossible to breathe. People who are likely to be exposed to it should wear a gas mask.

====Diesel engines====

====Gas-turbine engines====
In aircraft gas turbine engines, &quot;exhaust gas temperature&quot; (EGT) is a primary measure of engine health. Typically the EGT is compared with a primary engine power indication called &quot;engine pressure ratio&quot; (EPR). For example: at full power EPR there will be a maximum permitted EGT limit. Once an engine reaches a stage in its life where it reaches this EGT limit, the engine will require specific maintenance in order to rectify the problem. The amount the EGT is below the EGT limit is called EGT margin. The EGT margin of an engine will be greatest when the engine is new, or has been overhauled. For most airlines, this information is also monitored remotely by the airline maintenance department by means of ACARS.

====Jet engines and rocket engines====

In jet engines and rocket engines, exhaust from propelling nozzles which in some applications shows shock diamonds.

===Other types===

====From burning coal====
Flue gas is that emitted from ovens, furnaces and boilers.

====Steam engines====
In steam engine terminology the exhaust is steam that is now so low in pressure that it can no longer do useful work.

==Main motor vehicle emissions==

===NO&quot;x&quot;===

Mono-nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 (NOx) (whether produced this way or naturally by lightning) react with ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form nitric acid vapor and related particles. Small particles can penetrate deeply into sensitive lung tissue and damage it, causing premature death in extreme cases. Inhalation of NO species increases the risk of lung cancer and colorectal cancer. and inhalation of such particles may cause or worsen respiratory diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis and heart disease.

In a 2005 U.S. EPA study the largest emissions of came from on road motor vehicles, with the second largest contributor being non-road equipment which is mostly gasoline and diesel stations.

The resulting nitric acid may be washed into soil, where it becomes nitrate, which is useful to growing plants.

===Volatile organic compounds===

When oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in the presence of sunlight, ground level ozone is formed, a primary ingredient in smog. A 2005 U.S. EPA report gives road vehicles as the second largest source of VOCs in the U.S. at 26% and 19% are from non road equipment which is mostly gasoline and diesel stations. 27% of VOC emissions are from solvents which are used in the manufacturer of paints and paint thinners and other uses.

===Ozone===
Ozone is beneficial in the upper atmosphere, but at ground level ozone irritates the respiratory system, causing coughing, choking, and reduced lung capacity. It also has many negative effects throughout the ecosystem.

===Carbon monoxide (CO)===

Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries. Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless and tasteless, but highly toxic. It combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin, which blocks the transport of oxygen. At concentrations above 1000ppm it is considered immediately dangerous and is the most immediate health hazard from running engines in a poorly ventilated space. In 2011, 52% of carbon monoxide emissions were created by mobile vehicles in the U.S.

===Hazardous air pollutants (toxics)===
Chronic (long-term) exposure to benzene (C6H6) damages bone marrow. It can also cause excessive bleeding and depress the immune system, increasing the chance of infection. Benzene causes leukemia and is associated with other blood cancers and pre-cancers of the blood.

===Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5)===
The health effects of inhaling airborne particulate matter have been widely studied in humans and animals and include asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular issues, premature death. Because of the size of the particles, they can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs. A 2011 UK study estimates 90 deaths per year due to passenger vehicle PM. In a 2006 publication, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) state that in 2002 about 1 per-cent of all PM10 and 2 per-cent of all PM2.5 emissions came from the exhaust of on-road motor vehicles (mostly from diesel engines). In Chinese, European, and Indian markets, both diesel and gasoline vehicles are required to have a tailpipe filter installed, while the United States has mandated it for diesel only. In 2022, British testing specialist Emissions Analytics estimated that the 300 million or so gasoline vehicles in the US over the subsequent decade would emit around 1.6 septillion harmful particles.

===Carbon dioxide (CO2)===
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Motor vehicle CO2 emissions are part of the anthropogenic contribution to the growth of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere which according to the vast majority of the scientific community is causing climate change. Motor vehicles are calculated to generate about 20% of the European Union&#x27;s man-made CO2 emissions, with passenger cars contributing about 12%. European emission standards limit the CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and light vehicles. The European Union average new car CO2 emissions figure dropped by 5.4% in the year to the first quarter of 2010, down to 145.6 g/km.

===Water vapour===
Vehicle exhaust contains much water vapour.

====Water recovery====
There has been research into ways that troops in deserts can recover drinkable water from their vehicles&#x27; exhaust gases.

==Pollution reduction==

Emission standards focus on reducing pollutants contained in the exhaust gases from vehicles as well as from industrial flue gas stacks and other air pollution exhaust sources in various large-scale industrial facilities such as petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical plants and chemical production plants. However, these are often referred to as flue gases. Catalytic converters in cars intend to break down the pollution of exhaust gases using a catalyst. Scrubbers in ships intend to remove the sulfur dioxide (SO2) of marine exhaust gases. The regulations on marine sulfur dioxide emissions are tightening, however only a small number of special areas worldwide have been designated for low sulfur diesel fuel use only.

==Disease and early deaths==
Air pollution from fossil fuel use by industry, power generation, and transportation is estimated to kill over 5 million people each year. A 2013 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) indicates that 53,000 early deaths occur per year in the United States alone because of vehicle emissions. According to another study from the same university, traffic fumes alone cause the death of 5,000 people every year just in the United Kingdom.

Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles School of Public Health say preliminary results of their statistical study of children listed in the California Cancer Registry born between 1998 and 2007 found that traffic pollution may be associated with a 5% to 15% increase in the likelihood of some cancers. A World Health Organization study found that diesel fumes cause an increase in lung cancer.

The California Air Resources Board found in studies that 50% or more of the air pollution (smog) in Southern California is due to car emissions. Concentrations of pollutants emitted from combustion engines may be particularly high around signalized intersections because of idling and accelerations. Computer models often miss this kind of detail.

<text>Spider-Woman is the code name of several fictional characters in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first major version is Jessica Drew (and later impersonated by Veranke), the second major version is Julia Carpenter, and the third major version is Mattie Franklin. Several alternate reality incarnations of the character have additionally received attention, including the Ultimate Spider-Woman, Ashley Barton, and Gwen Stacy.

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics&#x27; then-publisher Stan Lee said in 1978, shortly after Spider-Woman&#x27;s debut in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #32 (Feb. 1977) and the start of the character&#x27;s 50-issue self-titled series (cover-dated April 1978 – June 1983), the character originated because,

Following that initial &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; series, more followed. Volume two was a miniseries published from November 1993 through February 1994; volume three was published from July 1999 through December 2000; and volume four, featuring Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, was published from November 2009 through May 2010.

Volume Five ran from November 2014 through the fall of 2015, featuring Jessica Drew as Spider-Woman. In the March 2015 issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; Vol. 3 #13, Jessica boasts &quot;I have never needed rescuing. Ever. See my wiki entry.&quot; In November 2015, &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; Vol. 6 launched as part of Marvel&#x27;s All-New, All-Different event with the same creative team as Volume 5. This volume saw her wearing the same costume as in Volume 5, but now she was pregnant and working as a private investigator. In October 2020, &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; #5, the fifth issue of Volume 7, being written by Karla Pacheco, marked the 100th issue of the title and Marvel celebrated the occasion with a special giant-sized issue.

==Spider-Women==
===Jessica Drew===

Jessica Drew is the original Spider-Woman who left the role in the early 1980s and returned to her mantle by the late 2000s.

===Julia Carpenter===

Julia Carpenter is the second Spider-Woman, a former member of the Avengers and Omega Flight, and also used the Arachne and Madame Web mantles.

===Mattie Franklin===

Mattie Franklin briefly impersonated the then-retired Spider-Man before receiving her own short-lived comics series as well as also appeared in &quot;Alias&quot; #16–21, before going on to appear in the 2007–2008 &quot;Loners&quot; miniseries.

===Charlotte Witter===

Charlotte Witter is a supervillain who used the Spider-Woman name.

===Veranke===

Veranke is a Super-Skrull and a queen of the Skrulls who impersonated Jessica Drew / Spider-Woman over a long period of time and was a founding member of the New Avengers.

===Ultimate Marvel===

A gender-swapped clone of Spider-Man appears in the Ultimate Marvel imprint, the mind of Peter Parker, teenage boy, waking up in the body of a teenage girl and having to adapt to their ‘new’ body.

===Gwen Stacy===

Gwen Stacy is Earth-65&#x27;s version of Spider-Woman. She plays this role in the comic book series &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot; and its adaptations to film.

==Other versions==
===Ashley Barton===
In the pages of &quot;Old Man Logan&quot;, Ashley Barton is the daughter of Tonya Parker and Hawkeye who did not like the way that Kingpin was running Hammer Falls. She becomes &quot;Spider-Bitch&quot;, allying herself with a new Punisher and Daredevil, and plans to take back Hammer Falls, only for the group to be captured and Daredevil and Punisher to be fed to the carnivorous dinosaurs. Hawkeye breaks his daughter out of her cell, whereafter Ashley immediately beheads Kingpin which avenges Daredevil and Punisher&#x27;s deaths. Then she attempts to kill her father, before taking over Hammer Falls as the new Kingpin. Old Man Logan rescues Hawkeye as Ashley sends her men after them. The character appears in the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; and &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storylines, now referred with her father&#x27;s surname as Ashley Barton, and alternately referred to as &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; and &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; due to the family-friendly nature of the narrative, and is among the spider-powered characters who are recruited by Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27;s mind in Peter Parker&#x27;s body) to help fight the Inheritors, before returning to the Wastelands in &quot;Venomverse&quot; and &quot;Old Man Quill&quot;.

===Claire Parker===
In &quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;, Peter and Mary Jane have twins named Benjy and Claire Parker (physically designed as a composite character of Mayday Parker and the Ultimate Spider-Woman). For the first ten years of their lives, the two were solely raised by Mary Jane in Portland, Oregon after she left Peter following a traumatic incident. In 1995, Peter lets Ben Reilly take over his life as Spider-Man and CEO of Parker Industries so he could return to his family. In the mid-2000s, Claire convinces Peter to return to New York and become Spider-Man once more shortly after Morlun kills Ben Reilly so he could stop Tony Stark from taking over Parker Industries and to lure Morlun away from his family. Despite his efforts, Morlun attacks the twins and Mary Jane in Oregon as Peter gets involved in the superhero Civil War. When Benjy discovers that Morlun is vulnerable when he is feeding off someone, he uses himself as bait to allow Claire the chance to impale him on a splintered log of wood. Benjy survives the assault, but is crippled for life. By 2019, Claire has become Spider-Woman (now wearing a costume the same as the Ultimate Spider-Woman&#x27;s), and is instructed by her father to stay behind to protect her brother and mother as he goes to space to end Doctor Doom&#x27;s reign of terror on the planet with Miles Morales (actually Otto Octavius).

===Earth X===
On Earth X, a character named Spidra appears. She was one of the last survivors of the Microverse following Psycho-Man&#x27;s attempt to drive the entire realm mad. Escaping with the rest of the Ant Men, who were formerly known as the Microns, Spidra and the rest of the Ant Men are charged with watching Immortus. They are later present at the wedding of King Britain and Medusa.

===Erin Hasko===

During the &quot;Web Warriors&quot; ongoing series, on accidentally coming across actors Felix Lifson and Erin Hasko, in a world where Spider-Man is fictional, shooting a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; movie (in which Erin is playing Gwen &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot; Stacy / Spider-Woman), Octavia Otto and the Web Warriors invite the duo to join the team, initially not noticing the pair to be actors shooting the film. On clearing up the misunderstanding, Octavia nonetheless makes the offer again, if either of them would be open to it, and excitedly noting that she learned three different types of martial arts for a previous role, Erin joins the Web Warriors and ventures into the multiverse with them, leaving her shocked crew behind, as Felix asks if they were still filming.

Erin returns in the video game &quot;Spider-Man Unlimited&quot;, now wielding a specialized set of web-shooters made for those lacking spider-strength as a &quot;real&quot; Spider-Woman. After the Spider-Queen escapes from Spider-Force custody, the game&#x27;s protagonist Spider-Man realizes that since Erin isn&#x27;t a Spider-Totem, the Queen cannot control her, and sends her on a mission to Horizon Labs to collect a device to suppress the Queen&#x27;s control over other spiders and Spider-People. Listed as &quot;Spider-Gwen (Erin Hasko)&quot;; in her character description, Erin is revealed to have been acting since she was three-years-old, with the film she was filming on her recruitment having been titled &quot;Spider-Woman: Goblin&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

===Helen Goddard===
An unrelated earlier Spider-Woman was published by Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler&#x27;s Dynamic Comics in 1944. She was Helen Goddard, a non-superpowered crime-fighter who made her first and only appearance in the Golden Age comic book &quot;Major Victory&quot; #1.

===Marvel 2099===
In the unified Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-2099, a Spider-Woman with the real name of Sivern Dru appears as a member of the 2099 version of the New Avengers. She comes from an as-yet-unidentified alien species.

===Mary Jane Watson===

There are several alternate versions of Mary Jane Watson known as Spider-Woman. The first version is a ninja of the Spider-clan in the Marvel Mangaverse, and another version is featured in the &quot;Exiles&quot; series.

===Mayday Parker===

Mayday Parker, Peter and MJ&#x27;s daughter from the alternate future MC2 who is commonly known as Spider-Girl, began calling herself Spider-Woman after her father&#x27;s death.

===Spider Super Stories===
A character called Spider-Woman (Valerie the Librarian) appears in the recurring live-action skit &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot; on the 1970s PBS children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, portrayed by Hattie Winston, who originated the character as the girlfriend of Easy Reader (portrayed by Morgan Freeman) before she become Spider-Woman. She also appears as Spider-Woman in the spin-off comic book series &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot; #11 (August 1975) where she has no superpowers.

===Squadron Supreme===
In the &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; series, Nell Ruggles was a young troubled girl, who upon gaining her powers killed her classmates, who had bullied her in the past. However, her superhuman powers allowed her to be traced back to a device which the Icarus One astronauts brought back from the Moon. Running away from home, she was captured by the Blur and turned over to Nick Fury&#x27;s S.H.I.E.L.D. Thanks to an electroshock collar, she has been prevented from leaving, though she appears to be making the best of the situation, having made friends and eventually falling in love with Tucker Ford, Biogeneral.

<doc id="840150" wikidata="Q381801" url="?curid=840150" title="Aert van der Neer">
<text>Aert van der Neer, or Aernout or Artus ( – 9 November 1677), was a landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age, who specialized in small night scenes lit only by moonlight and fires, and snowy winter landscapes, both often looking down a canal or river. He was a contemporary of Aelbert Cuyp and Meindert Hobbema, and like the latter he lived and died in comparative obscurity.

==Biography==
Van der Neer was born in Gorinchem. According to Arnold Houbraken, he worked as a steward to the lords of Arkel, which would account for the absence of any pictures dating from his early years. He became an amateur painter possibly upon contact with the Amsterdam painters Rafael and Joachim Govertsz Camphuysen, whose sister Lysbeth he married in 1629. They had six children: Grietje (1629), Eglon (~1635), Cornelia (1642), Elisabeth (1645), Pieter (1648), and Alida (1650). Five were baptized in the Nieuwe Kerk, not far from Kalverstraat where he lived.

Van der Neer was barely able to support his family by selling his landscapes, which were not highly valued. In 1659 it seemed necessary to supplement his income by keeping a wine tavern, but two years later he went broke. He died at Kerkstraat in abject poverty, and his art was so little esteemed that the pictures left by him were valued at about five shillings apiece. His son Eglon became a portrait painter himself.

==Career==
The earliest pictures in which Van Der Neer coupled his monogram of A.V. and D.N. interlaced with a date are a winter landscape in the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam (dated 1639), and another in the Martins collection at Kiel (1642) immature works both, of poor quality. Far better is the &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; (1643), and the &quot;Moonlight Scene&quot; (1644) once in the d&#x27;Arenberg collection in Brussels.

In 1652 Van Der Neer witnessed the fire which consumed the old town-hall of Amsterdam. He made this accident the subject for two or three pictures, now in the galleries of Berlin and Copenhagen. Though Amsterdam appears to have been constantly Van Der Neer&#x27;s domicile, his pictures tell that he was well acquainted with the canals and woods about Haarlem and Leiden, and with the reaches of the Meuse and Rhine. Dordrecht, the home of Aelbert Cuyp, is sometimes found in his pictures, and substantial evidence exists that there was friendship between the two men. At some period of their lives they laid their hands to the same canvases, on each of which they left their joint mark. On some it was the signature of the name, on others the more convincing signature of style. There are landscapes in the collections of the dukes of Bedford and Westminster, in which Cuyp has represented either the frozen Maes with fishermen packing herrings, or the moon reflecting its light on the river&#x27;s placid waters. These are models after which Van Der Neer appears to have worked.

The same feeling and similar subjects are found in Cuyp and Van Der Neer, before and after their partnership, but Cuyp was the leading genius. Van Der Neer got assistance from him; Cuyp expected none from Van Der Neer. He carefully enlivened his friend&#x27;s pictures, when asked to do so, with figures and cattle. It is in pictures jointly produced by them that we discover Van Der Neer&#x27;s presence at Dordrecht. We are near Dordrecht in the landscape sunset of the Louvre, in which Cuyp evidently painted the foreground and cows. In the National Gallery, London picture Cuyp signs his name on the pail of a milkmaid, whose figure and red skirt he has painted with light effectiveness near the edge of Van Der Neer&#x27;s landscape. Again, a couple of fishermen with a dog, and a sportsman creeping up to surprise some ducks, are Cuyp&#x27;s in a capital Van Der Neer at the Staedel Institute in Frankfurt.

Van Der Neer&#x27;s favourite subjects were the rivers and watercourses of his native country either at sunset or after dark. His peculiar skill is shown in realizing translucence which allows objects even distant to appear in the darkness with varieties of warm brown and steel greys. Another of his fancies is to paint frozen water, and his daylight icescapes with golfers, sleighers, and fishermen are as numerous as his moonlights. But he always avoids the impression of frostiness, which is one of his great gifts.

His pictures are not scarce. They are less valuable in the market than those of Cuyp or Hobbema; but, possessing a charm peculiarly their own, they are much sought after by collectors. Out of about one hundred and fifty pictures accessible to the public, the choicest selection is in the Hermitage at Saint Petersburg. In England paintings from his brush are to be found at the National Gallery and Wallace Collection.

<text>Force Works is the name of different fictional superhero teams appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
The first version of Force Works appeared in the comic book &quot;Force Works&quot; #1 (July 1994), created by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning and initially drawn by Tom Tenney. The team was formed from the remains of the West Coast Avengers, after leader Iron Man left the Avengers due to an internal dispute. Force Works maintained a different outlook than that of the Avengers, trying to preempt natural and man-made disasters.

The second version of Force Works was mentioned in &quot;Civil War&quot; #6.

==Fictional team biography==

===From the ashes of West Coast Avengers===
Force Works began shortly after the West Coast Avengers disbanded. Tony Stark, otherwise known as the superhero Iron Man, sought to form a superhero group with a different philosophy than its predecessors (most notably the East Coast branch of the Avengers): they would not just stop disasters, but prevent them. The team was initially composed of Iron Man, U.S. Agent, Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter), Scarlet Witch, and Wonder Man. By the end of their first mission, Wonder Man was thought dead at the hands of the invading Kree, and shortly thereafter the alien Century replaced him. The group used a combination of the Chaos Computer (a supercomputer that used incoming information to predict future events) and the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s powers to attempt to prevent major world problems.

Force Works used a Stark Enterprises facility known as The Works as their base. The building was fully equipped for the team&#x27;s use; it featured powerful security and stealth systems and incorporated nanotechnology that would repair the building if it were damaged. It was maintained by a Stark Industries staff, leaving Force Works to focus on its duties. The facility was also administered by an artificial intelligence system called P.L.A.T.O. (Piezo-electrical Logistic Analytical Tactical Operator). The Works also included living and training accommodations and could also produce hard-light holographs.

Although Force Works was officially led by the Scarlet Witch, Iron Man would often act insubordinately and make his own decisions during their missions. Later it was revealed that Iron Man was under the influence of the time-traveling villain Kang the Conqueror (even later revealed to be his future self Immortus in disguise). The team fought several battles, existed for just less than two years, and disbanded. Most of its members rejoined the Avengers or sank into obscurity.

Shortly after the disintegration of the group, Tony Stark died in his attempts to regain control of himself from &quot;Kang&quot; and was replaced by a younger, alternate-reality version of himself. The original Stark did not remain dead for long, due to the events that culminated in the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline.

===Force Works in the Fifty State Initiative===
A new version of Force Works was mentioned as being active and sent to Iowa as a part of the Fifty State Initiative. Although no members were shown or even named. According to editor Tom Brevoort on a Newsarama interview it could be that the team consists of new super-heroes, some could be existing &quot;Pro-reg&quot; heroes and some could be established heroes &quot;with an upgrade&quot;.

Force Works was again mentioned as a team when War Machine was sent into space to deal with attacking Skrulls. Investigating a Stark satellite, he discovered Cybermancer there, and it was implied by War Machine she was a member of Force Works.

<doc id="840157" wikidata="Q2296205" url="?curid=840157" title="Earthship">
<text>An Earthship is a style of architecture developed in the late 20th century to early 21st century by architect Michael Reynolds. Earthships are designed to behave as passive solar earth shelters made of both natural and upcycled materials such as earth-packed tires. Earthships may feature a variety of amenities and aesthetics, and are designed to withstand the extreme temperatures of a desert, managing to stay close to 70 °F (21 °C) regardless of outside weather conditions. Earthship communities were originally built in the desert of northern New Mexico, near the Rio Grande, and the style has spread to small pockets of communities around the globe, in some cases in spite of legal opposition to its construction and adoption.

Reynolds developed the Earthship design after moving to New Mexico and completing his degree in architecture, intending them to be &quot;off-the-grid-ready&quot; houses, with minimal reliance on public utilities and fossil fuels. They are constructed to use available natural resources, especially energy from the sun and rain water. They are designed with thermal mass construction and natural cross-ventilation to regulate indoor temperature, and the designs are intentionally uncomplicated and mainly single-story, so that people with little building knowledge can construct them. They can be perceived as a realization of the utopia of autonomous housing and sustainable living.
== History ==

Earthship architecture began development in the 1970s, when the architect Michael Reynolds set out to create a home that would fulfill three criteria. First, it would utilize sustainable architecture, and materials indigenous to the local area or recycled materials wherever possible. Second, it would rely on natural energy sources and be independent from the electrical grid. Third, it would be feasible for a person with no specialized construction skills to build. Eventually, Reynolds&#x27;s vision was transformed into the common U-shaped earth-filled tire homes seen today.

The name is based on the idea of a ship or a space ship, in order to allude to the home&#x27;s ability to provide everything for their inhabitants to survive: shelter, power, waste management, water, and food.
== Construction and design ==

Earthships are constructed based on six design principles that help contribute to the goal of environmentally sustainable building design:

# Building with natural and repurposed materials: Earthships utilize materials such as used tires, cans, bottles, wood, and mud.
# Thermal or solar heating and cooling: Earthships heat and cool themselves using thermal mass and solar gain. They do not use electricity or the burning of fuel to maintain temperature.
# Electricity from solar and wind: Electricity is collected using photovoltaic panels and occasionally windmills. Additionally, the electrical requirements of the buildings are minimized through the use of energy efficient lighting and appliances.
# Water harvesting: Water is collected from rain and snowmelt in the roof and is then stored in a cistern for future use.
# Sewage treatment: Self-contained sewage treatment and water recycling.
# Food production: In-home organic food production capability.

The buildings are often horseshoe-shaped due to the difficulty of creating sharp 90 degree angles with rammed tires. In Reynolds&#x27;s prototype at Taos, the opening of the horseshoe faces 10–15 degrees east of south to maximize natural light and solar-gain during the winter months, with windows on sun-facing walls admitting light and heat.

The book, &quot;Earthship I&quot;, describes how to find the best angle depending on the building&#x27;s geographic location. The thick and dense walls provide thermal mass that naturally regulates the interior temperature during both cold and hot outside temperatures. The outer walls in the majority of Earthships are made of earth-rammed tires, but any dense material with a potential to store heat, such as concrete, adobe, earth bags, or stone, could in principle be used to create a building similar to an Earthship. The tire walls are staggered like traditional brick work, and often have &quot;concrete half blocks&quot; every other course, to equal the length of the staggered tire below. In an effort to cut down the use of concrete even further, they also use &quot;squishies&quot; - tires rammed in between a tight space to even out the course or to compensate for varying tire size.

The rammed earth tires of an Earthship are assembled by teams of two people. One person shovels dirt and places it into the tire one scoop at a time. The other person, who stands on the tire, uses a sledgehammer to pack the dirt in while moving in a circle around the tire to keep the dirt even and to avoid warping the tire. Rammed earth tires can weigh up to , so they are typically filled in place. Because the tire is full of soil, it does not burn when exposed to fire. In colder climates, extra insulation is added on the outside of the tire walls.

On top of the tire walls are either &quot;can and concrete bond beams&quot; made of reused cans joined by concrete, or wooden bond beams with wooden shoes. These are attached to the tire walls using concrete anchors, poured blocks of concrete inside the top tires. Wooden shimming blocks placed on top of the wooden bond beam make up the wooden shoes. The wooden bond beam consists of two layers of lumber bolted on to the concrete anchors. Re-bar is used to &quot;nail&quot; the wooden shoes to the wooden bond beam.

Internal, non-load-bearing walls are often made of a honeycomb of reused cans joined by concrete; these are nicknamed tin can walls. These walls are usually thickly plastered with adobe, and resemble traditional adobe walls when finished.

The roof is made using trusses, or wooden support beams called vigas, that rest on the wooden shoes or the tin can walls placed on the bond beams. The roof as well as the north, east and west facing walls are heavily insulated to reduce heat loss.

The average cost in 2019 including labour and land is about $500,000.

== Water ==

Earthships are designed to catch all the water they need from the local environment. Water used in an Earthship is harvested from rain, snow, and condensation. Each inch of rain collected per square foot of water yields 2/3 gallons of water. As water collects on the roof, it is channeled through a silt-catching device and into a cistern. The cisterns are positioned to gravity-feed a water organization module (WOM) that filters out bacteria and contaminants, making it suitable for drinking. The WOM consists of filters and a DC-pump. Water is then pushed into a conventional pressure tank to create common household water pressure.

Water collected in this fashion is used for every household activity except flushing toilets. The toilets are flushed with greywater which has been used at least once already. Typically it is filtered waste-water from sinks and showers.

Greywater, recycled water unsuitable for drinking, is used within the Earthship primarily for flushing toilets. Before the greywater can be reused, it is channeled through a grease and particle filter/digester and into a deep rubber-lined botanical cell, a miniature living machine, within the Earthship. Here the water is oxygenated and filtered using bacteria and plants to reduce the nutrient load. 
Water from the low end of the botanical cell is directed through a peat moss filter and collected in a reservoir or well. The reclaimed water is passed once more through a greywater board and used to flush conventional toilets.

Black water is water that has been used in a toilet. Earthships utilize anaerobic digestion in their septic tanks, which naturally separate solid waste. The black water is used in concrete cells containing plants, separate from the grey water plants in the greenhouse; it may also be used in exterior planters. Studies on the safety of growing food plants in a black water system show low levels of &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria. It is not recommended to plant edibles in black water; building permits may be refused for plans indicating such usage of black water.

Where it is not possible to use flush-toilets operating on water, dry solar toilets are recommended.

== Power ==

Earthships are designed to collect and store their own energy. The majority of electrical energy is harvested from the sun and wind. Photovoltaic panels and wind turbines on or near the Earthship generate DC electricity that is stored in deep-cycle batteries. The batteries are housed in a purpose-built room on the roof. Additional energy can be obtained from gasoline-powered generators or by integrating with the city grid. For Canadian winters the solar cell exposed surface areas needs to be increased by over three times.

In an Earthship, a Power Organizing Module (POM) takes a proportion of stored energy from batteries and invert it for AC use. The Power Organizing Module is a prefabricated system provided by Earthship Biotecture that is simply attached to a wall on the interior of the Earthship and wired in a conventional manner. It includes the necessary equipment such as circuit breakers and converters. The energy run through the Power Organizing Module can be used to run any household appliance including washing machines, computers, kitchen appliances, print machines, and vacuums. Ideally, none of the electrical energy in an Earthship is used for heating or cooling.

== Thermal performance ==
Earthships rely on a balance between the solar heat gain and the ability of the tire walls and subsoil to transport and store heat. They are designed to use the properties of thermal mass and with the intent that the exterior earth-rammed tire walls provide thermal mass that will soak up heat during the day and radiate heat during the night, keeping the interior climate relatively comfortable all day. In addition to the exterior tire walls, some Earthships are sunk into the earth to take advantage of earth-sheltering to reduce temperature fluctuations.

Some earthship structures have suffered from heat loss into the ground during the heating season. This may be due to climatic differences between New Mexico, where earthships were first built, and cloudier, cooler, and wetter climates. Thermal performance problems may also have occurred due to thermal mass being erroneously equated to R-value. The imperial R-value of soil is about 1 per foot. Malcolm Wells, an architect and authority on earth-sheltered design, recommends an imperial R-value 10 insulation between deep soils and heated spaces. Wells&#x27;s insulation recommendations increase as the depth of the soil decreases (a negative correlation).

In addition to thermal mass, Earthships use passive solar heating and cooling. Large front windows with integrated shades, trombe walls and other technologies such as skylights or Steve Baer&#x27;s &quot;Track Rack&quot; solar trackers are used for heat regulation. Earthships are positioned so that its principal wall, which is nonstructural and made mostly of glass sheets, faces directly toward the equator. This positioning allows for optimum solar exposure. To allow the sun to heat the mass of the Earthship, the solar-oriented wall is angled so that it is perpendicular to light from the winter sun. This allows for maximum exposure in the winter, when heat is wanted, and lesser exposure in the summer, when heat is to be avoided. Some Earthships, especially those built in colder climates, use insulated shading on the solar-orientated wall to reduce heat loss during the night.

Current Earthship designs like the global module have a &quot;double greenhouse&quot; where the outside glass is angled toward the equator, and an internal glass wall forms a walk way or hallway as you step into the Earthship. This greenhouse is primarily used to grow food; it also creates a barrier for the &#x27;comfort zone&#x27; inside the house.

== Ventilation ==
Earthships structures have a natural ventilation system based on convection. A pipe extends from the interior of the house under the berm, cooling the air by the time it gets to the comfort zone. As the hot air rises, the system creates a steady airflow - of cooler air coming in, and warmer air blowing out though a smaller vented window in the greenhouse.

== Around the world ==
=== Africa ===

Angel and Yvonne Kamp built the first Earthship in South Africa between 1996 and 1998. They rammed a total of 1,500 tires for the walls. The Earthship, near Hermanus, is located in a private nature reserve which is part of a area enclosed in a game fence and borders the Walker Bay Nature Reserve.

The second earthship in South Africa is a recycling centre in Khayelitsha run as a swap shop. The centre was finished in December 2010. Another low-cost house built with tires is in development in Bloemfontein.

The Earthship inspired experiment in South Africa is combined living quarters and the Sonskip / Aardskip open-air museum in Orania. This earthship is based on the global earthship model and is built with a foundation of tires, have roof bearing walls built with earthbags and interior walls built with cob, cans, and plastic bottles. This Earthship adheres to all six principles of an Earthship. This is the largest earthbag earthship in the world.

A residential house was in the planning phase for Eswatini in 2013.

In 2011, construction began on the Goderich Waldorf School of Sierra Leone. The school was the first educational institution to use earthship architecture. Although Mike Reynolds and a team of interns helped complete the first two classrooms, the majority of the building was built by community members who had been trained in Reynolds&#x27; building techniques.

A new project was scheduled to commence in Malawi in October 2013. During that first visit, the team was able to complete two of the intended eight rooms. Biotechure Planet Earth came back to collaborate on the Malawi project in 2015 in order to complete the community center for the rural village. The crew was made up of a group of volunteers as well as locals all made up to create an 8-room building made out of tires, cans and bottles. Finally, in a web post uploaded in February 2020, it was confirmed that the community structure in Kapita, Malawi could be finished.

=== Australia ===
Earthship Ironbank was built by Martin and Zoe Freney south-east of Adelaide in South Australia and is the first earthship constructed with council permission in Australia.

=== Europe ===
In 2000, Michael Reynolds and his team came to build the first residential earthship in Boingt (Belgium). While water, power module, solar panels and the team were on their way to Europe, the mayor of Boingt put his veto on the building permit. Josephine Overeem, the woman who wanted to build the earthship, and Michael Reynolds decided to do a demonstration model in her back yard at her residence in Strombeek (Belgium). CLEVEL invited Reynolds from Belgium to Brighton in the UK, and orchestrated plans for the earthship in Brighton, started in 2003. This was the beginning of a series of trips made by Reynolds and the construction of earthships in the UK, France and the Netherlands.

In 2004, the very first Earthship in the UK was opened at Kinghorn Loch in Fife, Scotland. It was built by volunteers of the SCI charity. In 2005, the first earthship in England was established in Stanmer Park, Brighton with the Low Carbon Trust. In 2007, CLEVEL and Earthship Biotecture obtained planning permission to build on a development site overlooking the Brighton Marina in the UK. The application followed a six-month feasibility study, orchestrated by Daren Howarth, Kevan Trott and Michael Reynolds and funded by the UK Environment Agency and the Energy Savings Trust. The successful application was for sixteen one, two, and three-bedroom earthship homes on this site, expected to have a sale price of 250 - 400,000 pounds. The homes are all designed according to basic earthship principles developed in the United States and adapted to the UK. 15,000 tires will be reused to construct these homes (the UK burns approximately 40 million tires each year). The plans include the enhancement of habitats on the site for lizards that already live there, which is the reasoning behind entitling the project &quot;The Lizard&quot;. This would have been the first development of its kind in Europe.

The first official Earthship home in mainland Europe with official planning permission approval was built in a small French village called Ger. The home, which was owned by Kevan and Gillian Trott, was built in April 2007 by Kevan, Mike Reynolds and an Earthship Crew from Taos, it was sold to a family in 2014. The design was modified for a European climate and is seen as the first of many for the European arena. It is currently used as a holiday home for eco-tourists.

Further adaptation to the European context was undertaken by Daren Howarth and Adrianne Nortje in Brittany, France. They obtained full planning permission in 2007 and finished the Brittany Groundhouse as their own home during 2009. The build experience and learning is documented in the UK Grand Designs series and in their book.

Earthships have been built or are being built in Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Estonia and Czech Republic.

The first official earthship district (23 earthships) in Europe was developed in Olst (the Netherlands). Building started in Spring 2012 and completed in December, 2014. In Belgium, 1 earthship hybrid is also being built, intended as demonstration buildings. Since it is illegal to use tires in Belgium (for risk of leaking toxic metals like lead and zinc), the project uses earthbags instead.

The Earthships built in Europe by Michael Reynolds have to be adapted to perform as intended. Some showed problems with moisture and mould. Some research into thermal performance was done by the University of Brighton on the Brighton Earthship. The first successful construction of an Earthship in Germany (Tempelhof/Kreßberg, 2015/16) used fewer thermal bridges but increased insulation in cooperation with a Fraunhofer Institute to prevent any mould problems.

=== Central America ===
An earthship was constructed in 2015 by the Atkinson family in southern Belize. It featured on the June 2015 UK Channel 4 TV programme Escape to the Wild, season 1, episode 3.

Guatemala also hosts two earthships.

=== South America ===
The first Earthship in South America was built in January 2014 in the town of Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Today this building functions as a visitor center and example of self-sustainable living.

In March 2016, an Earthship school was built in Jaureguiberry, Uruguay. In May 2018, another Earthship school was built in Mar Chiquita, Argentina.

=== New Zealand ===
An earthship has been built by Dawn and Lance Kirtlan near Ashburton, Canterbury. They were inspired by Mike Reynold&#x27;s books and worked with a local architect and engineer, reporting that the local council were very supportive of the project.

== In popular culture ==
The film &quot;Garbage Warrior&quot; is about Earthships and Reynolds&#x27; struggle with obtaining permits to build out of unconventional material and off the grid.

The television series Building Off the Grid, which aired on the DIY Network, featured a home construction episode about building an Earthship.

<text>Reichelsheim (Odenwald) is a municipality in the Odenwaldkreis (district) in Hesse, Germany.

==Geography==

===Location===
Reichelsheim lies in the middle Odenwald at elevations between 200 and 538 m in the middle of the &quot;Geo-Naturpark Bergstraße-Odenwald&quot;.

===Neighbouring communities===
Reichelsheim borders in the north on the communities of Fränkisch-Crumbach, Brensbach and Brombachtal, in the east on the town of Michelstadt and the community of Mossautal (all in the Odenwaldkreis), in the south on the community of Fürth and in the west on the town of Lindenfels (both in Bergstraße district).

===Constituent communities===
Reichelsheim’s &quot;Ortsteile&quot;, besides the main one, also called Reichelsheim, are Beerfurth, Bockenrod, Eberbach, Erzbach, Frohnhofen, Gersprenz, Gumpen, Klein-Gumpen, Laudenau, Ober-Kainsbach, Ober-Ostern, Rohrbach and Unter-Ostern.

==History==
In 1303, Reichelsheim had its first documentary mention.

==Politics==

The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:
===Mayors===
In the mayoral election in 2008, Stefan Lopinsky (RWG) was elected with 61.2% of the vote.

From 1990 to 2008, the community’s mayor was Gerd Lode (SPD).

===Coat of arms===
The community’s arms might heraldically be described thus: Gules on a mount Or three oaks Or, in between also two oak saplings Or, above them three mullets of six argent, the sinister and dexter slightly lower.

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Fairytale and Saga Days===
Since 1995, yearly on the last weekend in October, the &quot;Reichelsheimer Märchen- und Sagentage&quot; are held, during which the &quot;Wildweibchenpreis&quot; (or “Wild Woman Prize”, this “wild woman” being a character in German legend) is awarded. Many mediaeval sets and costumes are on show to admire.

===Regional museum===
This is housed in the former town hall, Germany’s oldest timber-frame town hall with the stud bracing called a &quot;Mannform&quot; in German. Exhibition highlights are mining, typical handicrafts such as gingerbread baking, &quot;Gäulchesmacher&quot; (woodcarvers who carve horses), shakemakers and shoemakers along with village school life of yore and the old Reinheim-Reichelsheim railway.

===Schloss Reichenberg===
Today’s &quot;Schloss Reichenberg&quot; (palace) came into being as Richenburg Castle in the 13th century, and had its first documentary mention in 1307. Worth noting is the &quot;Herrenhaus&quot; (“Lord’s house”), or &quot;Palas&quot;. The &quot;Palas&quot; was called the Crooked Building (&quot;Krummer Bau&quot;) for its crooked footprint.

Here on 14 February 1776, Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck, who later became a prominent botanist, zoologist and mycologist, was born. He was a friend of Goethe’s, a cofounder of the University of Bonn and the Bonn Botanical Garden, President of the Leopoldina for 40 years and Director of the Botanical Garden in Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland), where he died on 16 March 1858.

Until the mid 19th century, the castle was undergoing continual changes in noble ownership. From 1876 to 1924, the castle, now styled &quot;Schloss Reichenberg&quot;, was used as a private upperclass boys’ school. Thereafter, the Siefert family from the &quot;Frohnhof&quot; took over the palace. They sold some of the buildings in 1963 as a holiday home to Deutsche Bundespost.

In July 1979, &quot;Schloss Reichenberg&quot; was bought by the ecumenical community &quot;Offensive Junger Christen&quot; (OJC, literally “Young Christians’ Offensive”, but known in English as the Reichenberg Fellowship). They converted it into a publicly accessible international meeting and conference centre with a palace café. The upper, older part of the palace, the so-called Crooked Building, is currently being renovated.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
By way of &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 47 (&quot;Nibelungenstraße&quot; between Michelstadt and Worms) and 38 (between Roßdorf bei Darmstadt and Weinheim/Mannheim), which together run through the community, Reichelsheim is linked to the long-distance road network. Bus connections to Bensheim, Fürth im Odenwald, Reinheim and Michelstadt afford a link to the public railway network (Deutsche Bahn and Odenwaldbahn).

<doc id="840163" wikidata="Q640008" url="?curid=840163" title="Sleeper (band)">
<text>Sleeper are an English rock band formed in London in 1992. The group had eight UK top 40 hit singles and three UK top 10 albums during the 1990s. Their music was also featured in the soundtrack of the pop cultural hit movie &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. The band split up in 1998, but reunited in 2017.

==History==
===First three albums (1992–1998)===
Jon Stewart met Louise Wener at Manchester University in 1987 in a political philosophy class. They played in a number of bands at university, including jazz outfit the Lime Street Blues Band, then after graduating in 1988, moved to London to seek gigs. Wener later wrote that &quot;we sounded not unlike the Sundays, but as time went on our music became increasingly influenced by US bands such as Hole, Nirvana and, most especially, the Pixies&quot;. They advertised for new band members in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; (&quot;Bass player and drummer wanted. Influences The Pixies and The Partridge Family&quot;) and recruited Diid Osman and Andy Maclure. Wener solicited interest from record label representatives by sending out a fake &quot;NME&quot; review, a move she called &quot;pure cheek and cut-and-paste fakery.&quot;

At one point, the band called themselves Surrender Dorothy, after the smoke trail in the sky from the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; movie, but abandoned this idea after discovering that several other bands had done the same thing. They subsequently chose the name &quot;Sleeper&quot; after the Woody Allen film &quot;Sleeper&quot;, and also because the word has a number of different meanings (a spy, an unexpected hit, etc.). In 1993 Sleeper signed to Indolent Records, a subsidiary of RCA Records, and released three EPs and singles before their breakthrough single release, &quot;Inbetweener&quot;, which notably featured UK TV personality Dale Winton in the promo video. Prior to the release of &quot;Inbetweener&quot; Sleeper had been the opening act for Blur on that band&#x27;s tour to promote the &quot;Parklife&quot; album, and became closely associated with Britpop as a result.

The band&#x27;s debut album release &quot;Smart&quot; was certified gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was followed by the platinum-selling (over 300,000 copies) release &quot;The It Girl&quot; which yielded four top 20 hit singles &quot;What Do I Do Now?&quot;, &quot;Nice Guy Eddie&quot;, &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; and &quot;Statuesque&quot;. Sleeper recorded a cover of the Blondie song &quot;Atomic&quot;, which was used in the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, after Blondie refused to allow the use of the original version. &quot;Statuesque&quot; also features in the movie and its follow-up soundtrack volume. The band’s third album, &quot;Pleased to Meet You&quot;, released October 1997, was a UK Top 10 hit and certified silver, though had fewer sales than the previous albums; the band split in March 1998 after a tour in which venues had been cancelled or downsized due to lower than expected ticket sales.

===Post-split (1999–2016)===
After Sleeper split, Wener and Maclure recorded material for a new project, aimed at a more mainstream market and featuring a guest appearance by George Michael. However, the project was not completed at the time, and Wener went on to have a career as a novelist. Her fourth book for Hodder &amp; Stoughton was published in 2008. Wener also features prominently as an interviewee in John Dower&#x27;s feature film documentary on Britpop, &quot;Live Forever&quot; (2003).

Stewart moved to Los Angeles, California, where he played with West Coast band UFO Bro and contributed as a session guitarist to k.d. lang&#x27;s album &quot;Invincible Summer&quot; (2000) and Melanie C&#x27;s album &quot;Reason&quot;. After returning to the UK he became Course Leader of the BA (Hons) Music Business and a lecturer in popular culture and music history at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute in Brighton, where his former students include The Kooks, James Bay, Black Honey, The Xcerts, Kate Walsh and Luke Sital-Singh, as well as members of As It Is and Miss Vincent, amongst others. Stewart also wrote a monthly column for &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine from 2002 to 2010, and gained a PhD in Music from the University of Southampton in 2018. In 2019 he joined The Wedding Present as guitarist during their thirtieth anniversary &quot;Bizarro&quot; UK and EU tour.

Osman subsequently went on to become a session player with Parlophone records band Dubstar and later became an artist manager, with bands including Infectious Music outfit My Vitriol, Hell Is For Heroes on EMI and Atlantic Records band The Glitterati, and helped writer-producer Justin Parker sign to Sony Music publishing. Maclure later ran a &quot;Punk Rock Karaoke&quot; enterprise with DJ Steve Lamacq.

A greatest hits compilation, with a tracklisting selected by and artwork designed by the band themselves, was released on Sony/BMG in 2007. Their first two albums were reissued as deluxe versions on 29 November 2010, with second discs of B-sides and live tracks.

By 2014, Wener and MacLure had formed another band, Huge Advance, although they only played in and around their residential suburb of Crouch End.

=== Reunion (2017–present) ===
Sleeper reformed in 2017 to play in four British cities in July and August, as part of the Star Shaped Festival, alongside other Britpop acts including Space, Dodgy and The Bluetones. These dates saw Wener, Maclure and Stewart joined on bass by new member Kieron Pepper, previously known as live drummer for The Prodigy from 1997 to 2007, and were followed by an eleven-date headline tour of the UK in spring 2018.

In the summer of 2018, Sleeper announced that they were recording a new album in collaboration with their old producer Stephen Street for release in early 2019 and that this would be accompanied by another headline UK tour. Lead single &quot;Look at You Now&quot; premiered on BBC Radio 6 Music on 4 December 2018, while presenter Steve Lamacq announced the title of the new album was &quot;The Modern Age&quot;.

During 2020 Wener and Maclure compiled unreleased material from previous recording sessions, including the George Michael collaboration, with new material as the basis for a new Sleeper album &quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot;, released on 14 December 2020.

In 2021, Sleeper were credited on &quot;Bad Things&quot;, an R&amp;B-laced indie-pop track by Greater Manchester based band The Lottery Winners. The track features vocals from Louise Wener and can be found on an eight-track EP by The Lottery Winners called &quot;Start Again&quot;.

The band toured the UK in Spring 2022 performing their 1996 album &quot;The It Girl&quot;. The Lottery Winners were the support act. In 2023 the band undertook a UK acoustic tour as &#x27;Sleeper unplugged&#x27;.

Frontwoman Louise Wener, along with Elastica&#x27;s Justine Frischmann, was one of Britpop&#x27;s biggest female stars, and became one of its enduring sex symbols, placing highly in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; &quot;Sexiest Woman&quot; polls two years running. Wener enjoyed significant media coverage, including an &quot;NME&quot; front cover and a slot as guest presenter of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The band had multiple appearances on &quot;The Word (TV series)&quot; and also on &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described how Wener&#x27;s &quot;forthright opinions on female sexuality, censorship, and other issues, have been manna for feature editors.&quot;

The band was the inspiration for the phrase &quot;Sleeperbloke&quot;, referring to the disparity between the glamorous singer Wener and the other frequently ignored members of the band (who tended to be far more anonymous and stood at the back). This pejorative term was used by music press journalists and musicians, to refer to any person of limited standing within a band or an especially drab and unremarkable individual. The &quot;Sleeperblokes&quot; themselves were reported to be highly amused by the phrase, and even produced an ironic &quot;Sleeperbloke&quot; T-shirt to go with Wener&#x27;s &quot;Another Female Fronted Band&quot; T-shirt, both of which sold well.

<doc id="840166" wikidata="Q616337" url="?curid=840166" title="War Machine">
<text>War Machine is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by David Michelinie, John Byrne, and Bob Layton as a supporting character for Iron Man, he first appeared in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #118 (1979) and became a superhero with the Iron Man armor in issue #169 (1983). War Machine has since been established as an independent superhero and appeared in multiple standalone series in addition to his appearances in &quot;Iron Man&quot; comics.

War Machine is the title adopted by James Rupert &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes after he acquired the War Machine armor. He is a military veteran and pilot who began working for Tony Stark, eventually discovering that he was Iron Man and then taking Stark&#x27;s place when he was incapacitated. Stark subsequently gave Rhodes the War Machine armor. The character is among the earliest African American superheroes in mainstream comics. His race, his military experience, and his sense of morality are often used to contrast him with Tony Stark and to analyze the themes of Iron Man stories through a different perspective. War Machine is the primary romantic interest of Carol Danvers, while many of his other supporting characters and villains overlap with those of Iron Man.

War Machine has been the main character of two &quot;War Machine&quot; volumes (1994–1996 and 2009–2010), as well as other stories including &quot;The Crew&quot; (2003), &quot;Iron Man 2.0&quot; (2011), and &quot;Iron Patriot&quot; (2014). An adaptation of War Machine appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portrayed by Terrence Howard in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008) and by Don Cheadle in subsequent appearances.

==Publication history==
=== 20th century ===
James Rhodes was created by writer David Michelinie with artists John Byrne and Bob Layton. Rhodes first appeared in a single panel of &quot;Iron Man&quot; #118 (1979), introduced as a friend of Tony Stark, and he saw a recurring role as Stark&#x27;s personal helicopter pilot. Many comic books and other works in popular culture had begun introducing duos of one white character and one black character. Such a development had not occurred in &quot;Iron Man&quot; until Rhodes&#x27;s introduction. One African American character, Eddie March, was introduced as Iron Man&#x27;s successor in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #21 (1970), but this character was severely injured and written out of the series before being elevated as Iron Man&#x27;s partner. Shortly after his first appearance, Rhodes assisted Iron Man in defeating Justin Hammer throughout issues published in 1979. He was established as a more prominent supporting character in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #144 (1981), which described his connection to Tony Stark and how they met during the Vietnam War. This depiction of Rhodes made him a central character in Iron Man&#x27;s history and origin, elevating his importance beyond what had been written for Marvel&#x27;s black characters to that point.

When Denny O&#x27;Neil was the writer for &quot;Iron Man&quot; comics, he chose to write Stark out of the role entirely in favor of Rhodes. Rhodes was first portrayed using Iron Man armor in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #169 (1983), when he had to fight a villain in the stead of a drunk and defeated Tony Stark. A black superhero replacing a white one was almost unprecedented at the time, with DC Comics having only recently attempted a similar change with its character John Stewart, who was created by O&#x27;Neil. From this change, O&#x27;Neil created a story arc in which Stark relapsed into alcoholism and Rhodes reluctantly took up the armor and the title of Iron Man. The change saw mixed reactions from readers, as Rhodes&#x27;s tenure as Iron Man emphasized his lack of experience or expertise regarding the Iron Man armor. For the duration of the story arc, the &quot;Iron Man&quot; series focused primarily on Rhodes, with Stark&#x27;s recovery being relegated to a subplot. It also included the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover event, which featured Rhodes as Iron Man rather than Stark. Stark resumed the role of Iron Man in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #200 (1985).

During Iron Man&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Armor Wars&quot; story arc, Rhodes accompanies Iron Man in his mission to fight those who had acquired the Iron Man armor technology. Rhodes again served as a replacement for Stark beginning in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #284 (1992), while Stark was in suspended animation. He began using the War Machine armor at this time, continuing as Iron Man until Stark returned the following year in issue #289. Keeping the War Machine armor, Rhodes was established as a new superhero, War Machine. He subsequently appeared in &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot; beginning in issue #94 (1993), but the series ended shortly afterward. &quot;Iron Man&quot; writer Len Kaminski did not intend to give Rhodes the War Machine armor permanently, but editor Nel Yomtov insisted after it was well received.

War Machine was one of several characters to serve as grittier and more violent anti-hero versions of established characters during the 1990s. The character received his own series with the release of &quot;War Machine&quot; #1 (1994), written by Kaminski and Scott Benson and penciled by Gabriel Gecko. This series featured Deathlok and Cable as supporting characters, and it ran for twenty-five issues across two years. &quot;War Machine&quot; was introduced with a story relating to Africa and the continent&#x27;s politics, reflecting Western interest in the subject following widespread reporting of the Somali, Rwandan, and Liberian civil wars. By issue #15 (1995), the focus shifted to speculative fiction involving aliens and time travel. Rhodes was given an alien symbiote armor during this series to differentiate him from Iron Man, but the change was short-lived. The series ended during a larger reorganization of Marvel amid financial problems. In the years following the end of &quot;War Machine&quot;, Rhodes became a minor character with only limited appearances.

=== 21st century ===
The short-lived 2003 series &quot;The Crew&quot; by Christopher Priest and Joe Bennett featured War Machine as a main character. This role saw him entirely separate from Iron Man for the first time, as he pawns off parts from his armor. He subsequently appeared in the &quot;Sentinel Squad ONE&quot; miniseries. As anti-terrorism became a prominent theme in fiction after the September 11 attacks, War Machine slowly became a more significant supporting character. Stark&#x27;s central role in the Marvel Universe elevated War Machine, as did Rhodes&#x27;s own military backstory. During the 2008 &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; event, writer Christos Gage wrote issues #33–35 of &quot;Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, in which War Machine replaced Iron Man as the main character.

A second &quot;War Machine&quot; series ran for one year from 2009 to 2010, following a similar plot to the African story arc of his first series but instead taking place in the Middle East, reflecting American interest in the region during the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. War Machine became more well known after the character was adapted to film, beginning in 2008. He had a significant presence in the comic series &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot;, which began the same year and ran until 2012. In this series, writer Matt Fraction had Rhodes join the military as War Machine. Rhodes&#x27;s next solo series was &quot;Iron Man 2.0&quot; (2011). Following this, Rhodes was reintroduced as the Iron Patriot, reflecting changes made to the film adaptation of the character. The political thriller series &quot;Iron Patriot&quot; ran in 2014, written by Ales Kot and illustrated by Garry Brown. As part of Marvel&#x27;s 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; event, Rhodes&#x27;s character was killed off to emphasize the story&#x27;s stakes. The choice was controversial, both for the lack of narrative payoff and for the choice of killing one of Marvel&#x27;s main non-white characters. The character was resurrected in &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot; #600 (2018).

== Characterization ==
=== Fictional character biography ===
James Rhodes grew up in South Philadelphia until he enlisted in the military. While serving in the Vietnam War, Rhodes encounters Iron Man, who had just built his first armor and escaped from his captors, and the two work together to reach safety at the U.S. embassy. As time went on and the Vietnam War no longer corresponded with Rhodes&#x27;s age, the conflict was retroactively changed to a war in the fictional nation of Siancong. He eventually began working for Stark as a pilot, and the two became friends. When Stark&#x27;s alcoholism prevents him from fighting the supervillain Magma, Rhodes takes the Iron Man armor and continues the fight. Stark&#x27;s alcoholism grows worse, and Rhodes takes the armor to become Iron Man. As Iron Man, he resigns from the Avengers and destroys the other Iron Man armors to keep them from being taken by Obadiah Stane.

As Stark begins to recover, Rhodes accompanies him in a new business venture, and they begin sharing the role of Iron Man. Since the armor was not designed for Rhodes, he begins experiencing headaches and mood swings, eventually returning the role to Stark in its entirety. When Stark is believed to be dying, he appoints Rhodes as his successor. Rhodes becomes the CEO of Stark Industries, and he becomes the new Iron Man using the War Machine armor. He gives up the role when he discovers that Stark faked his death, but he keeps the War Machine armor on Stark&#x27;s insistence. Becoming a new superhero, War Machine, Rhodes briefly joins the West Coast Avengers and then becomes a solo superhero after the team is disbanded. When human rights activist Vincent Cetewayo is kidnapped by his corrupt government in the fictional African country of Imaya, War Machine partners with Deathlok to stage an extralegal intervention and topple the government, despite protest from S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers. In response, Stark disables the War Machine armor until he needs Rhodes&#x27;s assistance to defeat the Mandarin. Rhodes retires from superhero work, and he briefly runs a salvage business until he finds himself investigating the death of his sister. He then works as a combat instructor for the Sentinel Squad.

When Rhodes is injured in a terrorist attack, he is augmented with cybernetic body parts, permanently turning him into War Machine. He travels to the fictional Middle Eastern country Aqiria where he encounters a military contractor that tortures and experiments on prisoners. Rhodes takes action without authorization, and he is put on trial for committing war crimes. His cybernetic body is destroyed in the subsequent jailbreak, but a cloned version of his healthy body had been made and his mind is transferred into it. Rhodes later takes on a new title, Iron Patriot, wearing armor in the national colors of the United States. In this new role, he goes to New Orleans, where he assesses the environmental risk posed against the city. He also rejects any further alignment with the military, unless it is purely in the capacity of domestic action or rescue operations. Rhodes is killed in a fight against Thanos, triggering a schism within the superhero community. He is later resurrected by Stark, who had discovered that their bodies could be restored due to the various augmentations that they had undergone while using the Iron Man armor.

=== Personality and motivations ===
Rhodes is moralistic relative to Stark, divesting Stark Industries from nuclear technology as CEO over objections from the board and taking action against foreign nations without regard for legalities. He takes actions that he believes to be right even when others believe it to be ill-advised, and he believes in ideals of &quot;freedom and love&quot;. He is willing to give the benefit of the doubt to other characters as opposed to Stark&#x27;s brasher approach. This aspect of his character was emphasized in the 2014 series &quot;Iron Patriot&quot;, which contrasted his sense of moral duty with his responsibility to his family. Writer Christos Gage described War Machine as someone prefers to lead soldiers into battle rather than deploy them.

When Rhodes first experienced the power of the Iron Man armor, he developed an addiction to it that mirrored Stark&#x27;s addiction to alcohol that necessitated his replacement. As a superhero, Rhodes pledged to help anyone without regard for race, nationality, or beliefs. His opposition to discrimination also included discrimination against mutants. He believes that the role of superheroes goes beyond fighting supervillains and that they should also take action against global problems such as world hunger and oppressive governments.

=== Themes and motifs ===
War Machine is an African American superhero in a genre that historically presented white characters as the default without meaningfully portraying the lives or worldviews of racial minorities. Rhodes&#x27;s origin, a black boy who left the ghetto to enlist in the military, reflected conservative sentiments in the late 1970s that African Americans should seek betterment through individual agency and that the military was a place where success was based on merit rather than race. His unsuccessful tenure as Iron Man similarly reflected the conservative belief that racial minorities were harmed by sudden increases in power. Conversely, his tenure as CEO of Stark Industries and his second tenure as Iron Man in 1992 reflected the increased acceptance of African Americans being depicted in popular culture. This depiction put him on a more equal ground to Stark, portraying Rhodes as a capable CEO and hero in his own right. When Rhodes became the main character of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, he faced many of the same obstacles as Stark, and many of the same themes were explored. Rhodes allowed these issues to be explored from a different perspective, of a character who diverged from the realism associated with Stark&#x27;s Iron Man and whose views were influenced by his African American identity. In the 1990s, Rhodes was one of several African American characters whose comics incorporated imagery associated with African American culture. Unlike other black Marvel heroes such as Falcon and Cloak, Rhodes&#x27;s race is not explicitly invoked as a defining aspect of his character or a common source of conflict.

Rhodes&#x27;s relationship with Stark evokes ideas of control and agency. Stark has control over the armor that Rhodes wears, and this becomes even more apparent when Stark installs the armor through cybernetics as part of Rhodes&#x27;s body. During Rhodes&#x27;s earliest outings in the Iron Man armor, he was pretending to be Stark&#x27;s Iron Man rather than acting independently with his own identity. This was somewhat addressed when Rhodes received his own standalone series, but the nature of the character inherently ties his identity to that of Iron Man. Their relationship also has a racial component, as Stark, the man in control of Rhodes&#x27;s destiny, is white. Despite this, any possible racial conflict between the two is not addressed explicitly.

&quot;War Machine&quot; writer Len Kaminski intentionally challenged the violent imagery of a heavily-armed character named War Machine by focusing on themes related to global human rights and liberal internationalism. He described the decision saying that &quot;it could subvert some of the people who might be attracted to it for all the wrong reasons, and maybe [the writers will] get them thinking&quot;. Rhodes is contrasted with Stark in his sense of responsibility. His backstory as a soldier became relevant in the 2000s when the United States engaged in the controversial Iraq War, and the character was used to explore ideas relating to such wars.

==Powers and abilities==

Rhodes becomes a superhero by using the War Machine armor. His first version of this armor, the &quot;Variable Threat Response Battle Suit&quot;, was equipped with heavy weapons for more direct combat than the standard Iron Man armor. The armor uses a black and gray color scheme; it was originally going to be changed to blue and gold after its debut appearance, but the black and silver design was popular enough that it was retained. Following the destruction of the War Machine armor during a 1995 issue of &quot;War Machine&quot;, he adopts an extraterrestrial biological armor, the Eidolon Warwear. Stark builds a new War Machine armor directly into Rhodes&#x27;s body after he sustains serious injuries. This was eventually replaced when Rhodes inhabited a healthy cloned body. As of 2010, Marvel Comics described his armor as giving him the power to lift 100 tons and to fly at Mach 2. Besides his armor, Rhodes&#x27;s history in the military includes combat training and experience, as both a soldier and a pilot.

== Supporting characters ==
Rhodes was initially created as a supporting character for Tony Stark. They began as friends, but their relationship became more acrimonious as they adjusted to Rhodes&#x27;s status as a superhero. After Rhodes was acclimated to using the War Machine armor, their shared experiences created a sense of trust between them, and Rhodes became one of Stark&#x27;s closest allies. Rhodes has fought many of Stark&#x27;s enemies, including Mandarin, Radioactive Man, and Thunderball. War Machine has adopted several of Stark&#x27;s allies as his own supporting characters, including Suzi Endo and Bethany Cabe. He has also formed alliances with new partners, including Parnell Jacobs, Glenda Jacobs, and Jake Oh. Parnell Jacobs, established as a friend-turned-enemy of Rhodes, acquired War Machine armor and used it as a mercenary. He returned as a supporting character in volume two of &quot;War Machine&quot; when Rhodes called on him as an ally, given his experience with the War Machine armor. The title of War Machine has also been used by the Punisher, who acquired the armor in the limited series &quot;Punisher: War Machine&quot;.

Carol Danvers, the superhero Captain Marvel and a fellow military veteran, has been the primary romantic interest for Rhodes. The two had a relationship leading up to the &quot;Civil War II&quot; event and Rhodes&#x27;s death. They reunited following his resurrection and Danvers&#x27;s return to Earth, with a brief interruption when Danvers went to the future and realized that Rhodes&#x27;s daughter was not hers. He has also had relationships with other characters, such as Stark Enterprises public relations director Marcy Pearson and Stark&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Rae LaCoste. In the 2014 &quot;Iron Patriot&quot; series, Rhodes&#x27;s father Terrence and his niece Lila are major supporting characters. The death of his sister Jeanette is a plot point in the 2003 series &quot;The Crew&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
Rhodes has historically taken a secondary role to Iron Man, though War Machine maintained independent popularity among comic book readers at times when Stark&#x27;s Iron Man was relatively forgotten. War Machine&#x27;s design fit closely with the aesthetic adopted by comic books in the 1990s. Portrayals of the character have been criticized for the subservient nature of Rhodes&#x27;s black character to Stark&#x27;s white character.

==In other media==

War Machine has been featured as a character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This version of Rhodes begins as the military liaison to Stark Industries as well as Tony Stark&#x27;s best friend, and he serves as the responsible character who acts as a foil to Stark&#x27;s impulsiveness. He first appeared in the franchise&#x27;s inaugural film, &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), played by Terrence Howard. Howard was replaced by Don Cheadle, who played the character in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010), &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&quot; (2021), and &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; (2023). He’s set to have his own standalone film in the franchise, titled &quot;Armor Wars&quot;. Adaptations of War Machine have appeared in various animated television series either as a supporting character to Iron Man or in guest appearances on programs about other Marvel superheroes.

<doc id="840168" wikidata="Q7646696" url="?curid=840168" title="Surrender Dorothy">
<text>&quot;Surrender Dorothy&quot; is a famous special effect used in the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, where the Wicked Witch of the West flies on her broomstick to write the two-word phrase across the sky. The phrase later attained local fame as graffiti in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

==Appearance in the movie==

The first appearance of the phrase is in the 1939 version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (it is not in the novel or any previous adaptations). In the scene, Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) has reached the Emerald City with her companions The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin Woodman (Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), whereupon they are treated to the hospitality and technological comforts of the fantastic city. As they leave the &quot;Wash &amp; Brush Up Co.&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) appears in the sky riding her broomstick, skywriting the words &quot;SURRENDER DOROTHY&quot;. The terrified townspeople of the Emerald City – and the four intrepid adventurers – respond by rushing to the chamber where the Wizard of Oz himself (Frank Morgan) resides, only to be turned away by a majordomo (also played by Frank Morgan) based loosely on the Soldier with the Green Whiskers.

The special effect was achieved by using a hypodermic needle, spreading black ink across the bottom of a glass tank filled with tinted water.

Originally, there was a full message written out by the Witch, seen only in the first 120-minute test screening. The full message read &quot;SURRENDER DOROTHY OR DIE --W W W&quot;.

==Washington area graffiti==

The message reading &quot;Surrender Dorothy&quot; in the D.C. metropolitan area first appeared on the bridge carrying Linden Lane over the outer loop of I-495 (the &quot;Capital Beltway&quot;) near the Washington D.C. Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Kensington, Maryland, which is illuminated at night. The message was first placed in 1974 by students of Connelly School of the Holy Child by pressing newsprint into a chain-link fence. It is not clear when the message was first written in paint. In the 1980s it was common to see on an adjacent railroad bridge, where it has been removed and re-painted many times since.

On the railway bridge, the location of the phrase is visible on approach driving on I-495 from the east, but only after one passes under the first of three bridges. It is the second of three bridges over the Beltway approaching from the east, with Seminary Road before it, and Linden Lane after it. As one approaches the bridges, first only the temple is visible in the distance, then as one passes under the first bridge, the temple comes back into view just as the words &quot;Surrender Dorothy&quot; appear.
In summer 2007, a new piece of graffiti appeared on the rail bridge. The word &quot;SURRENDER&quot; was reduced in size to fit into a single section of the rail bridge, and the word &quot;DOROTHY&quot; was omitted from the graffiti. The previous message is no longer visible, but may still be detected at the top of the bridge, as the paint used to cover it does not exactly match the original paint on the bridge. The smaller &quot;SURRENDER&quot; graphic is located near the bottom of the bridge, over the far-left lane of traffic on the Outer Loop. On August 24, 2018, &quot;SURRENDER DONALD&quot; lettering (referring to US president Donald Trump) was spotted on the same bridge over the Washington Beltway. Evidently, the sign was made of easily removable letters that minimize property damage and was installed between 4 and 5 AM. Reportedly, Claude Taylor and his MadDog PAC claimed responsibility. On November 5, during the 2020 United States presidential election, &quot;SURRENDER DONALD&quot; appeared again – this time in paint.

7 Locks Brewery in Rockville, Maryland initially named a beer Surrender Dorothy, with a version of the graffito/LDS church image on the label. Turner Entertainment, owner of The Wizard of Oz, opposed the use of the name and image by the brewery, which changed the beer name to &quot;Surrender&quot; and the can label to include &quot;Dorothy&quot; being painted over.
==Other cultural references==
The phrase was also later featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;After Hours&quot;. In the film, Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) relates that her former husband would scream the phrase during sex.

<text>The Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) was an amateur men&#x27;s ice hockey league founded on 8 December 1886, in existence until 1898. It was the second ice hockey league organized in Canada, after one in Kingston, Ontario started in 1883. It was organized to provide a longer season to determine the Canadian champion. Prior to its founding, the Canadian championship was determined in a tournament in Montreal. It is the first championship ice hockey league.

The 1893 champion of the league, Montreal Hockey Club was the first winner of the newly introduced Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup (later known as the Stanley Cup). Montreal was awarded the Cup as the champions of the AHAC since the AHAC was considered the top league of Canada.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
A meeting was called, for those in favour of the formation of a Dominion hockey association, for the evening of 8 December 1886. Mr. J.G. Monk of the Victoria Hockey Club was asked to send a written invitation to the Ottawa Hockey Club and the Quebec Hockey Club, asking each to send a representative to the meeting. Only Ottawa had responded. The meeting was held at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal and attended by the following delegates with Mr. Jack Arnton acting as Chairman and Mr. J. G. Monk as Secretary:

With all strongly in favour of forming the new association, the name given was the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada and a constitution similar to the one governing lacrosse was adopted but modified to suit hockey. Afterwards, officers were elected for the upcoming inaugural season, who were:

* President — Mr. Thomas D. Green
* First Vice-president — Mr. J. Arnton
* Second Vice-President — Mr. R. Laing
* Secretary-treasurer — Mr. E. Stevenson
* Council — Messrs. James Stewart, J. G. Monk, H. A. Budden, E. Sheppard, Percy Myles

They agreed that the season should run from 1 January 1887 until 15 March 1887.

The teams knew each other. They had competed at the Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments from 1883–1885 and the 1886 Dominion Championship:

* 1883 - Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament (winner McGill),
* 1884 - Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament (winner Victorias),
* 1885 - Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament (winner Montreal),
* 1886 - Dominion Championship (winner Crystals)

Thomas D. Green of Ottawa had played on the 1883 McGill hockey team.

===The game===

In that age, ice hockey was a very different game compared to today: the AHAC rules stated that there were six skaters on each side. These were defined as:

* left-wing
* centre
* right-wing
* rover
* point
* cover-point

The left-wing, centre and right-wing were the forwards, like today. The rover would line up behind the centre, with the point and cover-point following, in an &#x27;I&#x27; formation towards the goaltender. The face-offs were at a right angle to today&#x27;s practice, the centre men facing inwards from the sides of the rink. The goaltenders used no special equipment.

There were no goal nets. The goals were two posts, with no crossbar. An umpire would judge the legality of each score. There were no boards along the sides of the ice, and there were no standard dimensions for a rink, although dimensions were instituted for the positioning of the goal out from the ends of the rink.

A match was two halves of thirty minutes (also to note that in the day, &quot;game&quot; meant &quot;goal&quot; by modern definition). Sudden-death overtime was also in place, and a match would continue until a goal was scored in the event of a tie after regulation.

Players in all positions would normally play the entire 60 minutes.

===Official Rules of the AHAC===
# The captains of contesting teams shall agree upon two umpires (one to be stationed at each goal) and a referee.
# All questions as to games shall be settled by the umpires and their decision shall be final.
# All disputes on the ice shall be settled by the referee, and his decision shall be final.
# The game shall be commenced and renewed by a bully in the centre of the rink. Goals, six feet wide and four feet high, which shall be changed after each game, unless otherwise agreed.
# When a player hits a puck, any one of the same side who at such moment of hitting is nearer the opponent&#x27;s goal line is out of play and may not touch the puck himself, or in any way prevent any other player from doing so until the puck has been played. A player must always be on his own side of the puck.
# The puck may be stopped, but not carried or knocked on, by any part of the body. No player shall raise his stick above his shoulder. Charging from behind, tripping, collaring, kicking or shinning, shall not be allowed, and any player after having been twice warned by the referee, it shall become his duty to rule the player off for that match.
# When the puck gets off the ice behind the goals it shall be taken by the referee to five yards at right angles from the goal line and there faced. When the puck goes off the ice at the sides it shall be taken by the referee at five yards at right angles from the boundary line and there faced.
# The goalkeeper must not, during play, lie, kneel or sit upon the ice, but must maintain a standing position.
# Hockey sticks shall not be more than three inches wide at any point.
# Goal shall be scored when the puck shall have passed between the goalposts and below the top and passed from in front below an imaginary line across the top of posts.
# The puck must be made of vulcanized rubber, one inch thick all through, and three inches in diameter.
# A team shall be composed of seven players who shall be bona fide members of the club they represent. No player shall be allowed to play on more than one team during a season except in a case of a bona fide change of residence.
# Two half hours with an intermission of ten minutes between will be time allowed for matches. A match will be decided by the team winning the greatest number of games during that time. In case of a tie after playing the specified two half hours, play will continue until one side secures a game unless otherwise agreed upon between the captains before the match.
# No change of players must be made after a match has commenced except for reasons of accidents or injury during the game.
# Should any player be injured during a match and compelled to leave the field his side shall have the option of putting on a spare man from the reserve to equalize the teams; in the event of any dispute between the captains as to the injured player&#x27;s fitness to continue the game the matter shall at once be decided by the referee.
# Should a game be temporarily stopped, by the infringement of any of the rules the puck shall be brought back and a bully take place.

===Seasons format===
The AHAC operated on two different systems in its lifetime: the &quot;challenge system&quot;, where a championship team would face a new challenger each week for the championship, and the &quot;series system&quot;, which corresponds to the regular season found in the NHL today. With the exception of 1888, the challenge system was exclusively used in the AHAC before the advent of the Stanley Cup, while the series system became the norm in 1893, the first year the Cup was contested.

The first championship team of the AHAC was the Montreal Crystals, having unofficially being declared the champions before the AHAC. The first title change occurred on January 14, 1887, when the Montreal Victorias defeated the champions 4–0. The Victorias would hold the title until the very last challenge game when the Crystals won 3–2 in their third successive challenge. Because of the Vics&#x27; long run as champions, it was decided to switch to the series system in 1888.

The series system was a success, although a tie atop the standings between the Vics and the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC), and the subsequent scheduling of the tiebreaker game caused much trouble when the game was scheduled at a time when two Victorias players were injured, at the home venue of the Montreal HC. However, teams from outside Montreal incurred huge travelling expenses, which led the AHAC to revert to the challenge system.

===First Stanley Cup===
In 1893, the first year since 1888 where the AHAC played under a series system, the Montreal Hockey Club lost their first game against the Ottawa Hockey Club and proceeded to win their next seven en route to the championship. Lord Stanley announced that his challenge trophy (later known simply as the Stanley Cup) for the best amateur hockey team in Canada would be presented to the Montreal Hockey Club on May 15, 1893, as initial champion. At the time, the Montreal Hockey Club was in a dispute with its parent organization, the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (MAAA). The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy, while the directors of the MAAA decided to accept the trophy, considering it came from the Governor General of Canada. Thus, the trophy was accepted by the MAAA, but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present.

After accepting the trophy, the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them. In the end, the MAAA investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy, even though such an action would damage the reputation of the MAAA. It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were, in fact, not representative of the team itself, and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season, it was flatly refused (the first time the MAAA refused &quot;anything&quot; to the hockey club). Inexplicably, the hockey club reversed its position, and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the MAAA and the club. Indeed, the inscriptions on the Cup when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated &quot;Montreal HC&quot;. The MAAA, at one point, considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them. The issue would be finally resolved in later years, after various attempts at reconciliation.

===Dissolution===
At the annual meeting in December 1897, the Ottawa Capitals applied to join the AHAC but were turned down by the AHAC executive. The Capitals applied again at the annual meeting held in Montreal on December 10, 1898, leading to &quot;a cataclysm in the hockey world.&quot; This time, the AHAC executive voted in favour of admitting the Capitals for league membership.

&quot;The Globe&quot; noted that the Capitals were &quot;questionably amateur&quot;, referring to the paying of players. This led to the representatives of the Quebec Bulldogs, Montreal Victorias and Ottawa Hockey Club opting to withdraw from the association. The representative of the Montreal Hockey Club asked the group to reconsider but was declined, after which point Montreal HC also withdrew.

The withdrawing teams then met at the Windsor Hotel the same day. On December 14, the group met again and organized the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), adding the Montreal Shamrocks for a complete conversion of the AHAC into the CAHL. The new league adopted the existing constitution of the AHAC, with the exception that new teams required unanimous approval of the CAHL executive in order to join the league.

==Teams==
† Stanley Cup winner

Under the challenge system, the league championship would change hands until the end of the playing season. Under the series system, the league championship was only determined at the end of the season by best overall record or playoff.

; Source Information:

According to Arthur Farrell&#x27;s book of 1899, &quot;Hockey: Canada&#x27;s Royal Winter Game&quot;, Montreal Crystals are recorded as champions in 1887, and the Montreal Hockey Club is recorded as the winner from 1888–1894.

According to &quot;Ultimate Hockey&quot;, the play between 1887 and 1892 occurred in the challenge format and the title of champion could change after every series. The final champion at the end of the season&#x27;s worth of challenges would be considered &#x27;Dominion of Canada&#x27; champion.

<text>An online auction (also electronic auction, e-auction, virtual auction, or eAuction) is an auction held over the internet and accessed by internet connected devices. Similar to in-person auctions, online auctions come in a variety of types, with different bidding and selling rules.

eCommerce sales for businesses have been steadily increasing for years, and with the migration of virtually all transactions to digital due to the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide sales through ecommerce channels such as websites and online marketplaces increased overall in 2020 and beyond.

There are two primary markets for online auctions: business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C). B2C is forecast to have over a 1% annual growth rate, achieving a nearly 22% share of total global retail sales by 2024. B2B ecommerce gross merchandise value showed a similarly steady rate through 2019, as to mirror its retail B2C counterpart.

The largest consumer-to-consumer online auction site is eBay, which researchers suggest is popular because it is a convenient, efficient, and effective method for buying and selling goods.

Despite the benefits of online auctions, the anonymity of the internet, the large market, and the ease of access makes online auction fraud easier than in traditional auctions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) categorizes online auction fraud reports with online shopping categories.

==History==
Online auctions originated on web forums as early as 1979 on CompuServe and The Source, as well as through email and bulletin board systems. Auctioneers and sellers would post notices describing items for sale, minimum bids, and closing times. As the popularity of online auctions grew, websites dedicated to the practice began to appear in 1995 when two auction sites were founded. The first online auction site was Onsale.com, founded by Jerry Kaplan in May 1995. Onsale&#x27;s business model had the company act as the seller.

In September 1995, eBay was founded by French-Iranian computer scientist Pierre Omidyar using a different approach to online auctions by facilitating person-to-person transactions. This was a popular choice with consumers, leading eBay to become the largest e-commerce site in the early 2000s.

== Benefits of Online Auctions ==
A core benefit of an online auction is the removal of the physical limitations of a traditional auction that require attendees to be geographically located together, which greatly reduces audience reach.

Online auctions offer advantages to users that traditional auction formats do not offer such as the use of automated bids. Along with these benefits, online auctions have greatly increased the variety of goods and services that can be bought and sold in an auction format.

==Types==
===English auctions===

English auctions are also known as open outcry or raise prices. In live settings, English auctions are announced by either an auctioneer or by the bidders, and winners pay what they finally bid to receive the object. English auctions are the most common third-party online auction format and are known for their simplicity. The format is popular due to its ease-of-use in an online environment (since computers are capable of tracking and awarding an auction to the highest bidder from many bids).

===Reverse auction===
Reverse auctions are used primarily to place multiple sales offers before potential customers. Multiple sellers compete to obtain a buyer&#x27;s business, and prices typically decrease over time as new offers are made by sellers. They do not follow the typical auction format in that the buyer can see all the offers and may choose which they would prefer. Reverse auctions are used predominantly in a business context for procurement.

===Bidding fee auction===
A bidding fee auction (also known as a penny auction) requires customers to pay for bids, which they can increment an auction price one unit of currency at a time. The most notable bidding fee auction was Swoopo.

Critics compare this type of auction to gambling, as users can spend a considerable amount of money without receiving anything in return. The auction owner makes money in two ways: the purchasing of bids, and the actual amount made from the final cost of the item.

==Fraud==

The increasing popularity of using online auctions has led to an increase in fraudulent activity. This is usually performed on an auction website by creating a very attractive auction lot, such as a low starting bid level. Once a buyer wins a lot and pays for it, the fraudulent seller will either not proceed with the delivery, or send a less valuable version of the purchased item (replicated, used, refurbished, etc.). Protection to prevent such acts has become available, for example PayPal&#x27;s buyer protection policy. As PayPal handles the transaction, it has the ability to hold funds until a complaint is resolved and the victim can be compensated.

Auction fraud makes up a large percentage of complaints received by the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (around 63% in 2005 and 45% in 2006).

=== Shill bidding ===
Shill bidding is the most prominent type of online auction fraud where sellers themselves submit bids to increase the price of an item they have put up for sale, without intending to win. Shill bidding is also one of the most difficult types of fraud to detect, since it is usually conducted by the seller in collusion with one or more bidders in the auction. In 2011, a bidder on eBay became the first individual to be convicted of shill bidding on an auction. By taking part in the process, an individual is sometimes breaking the law, depending on the relevant jurisdiction, for example breaking the European Union fair trading rules which carries out a fine of up to £5,000 in the United Kingdom.

=== Shield bidding ===
Shield bidding is a technique whereby a buyer uses another account (called a &quot;shield&quot;) to discourage other competitors from bidding by artificially increasing the price and then at the last moment withdrawing their bid to allow the actual buyer to win the auction with a lower price. Most online auction sites do not allow withdrawal of bids except in specified circumstances, making this technique impossible to carry out except on sites where such a rule is not implemented.

=== Spotting Shills and Shields ===
It is difficult to spot a dirty technique being used by an anonymous or pseudonymous person in online auctions, but it is certainly doable. It can be revealed by examining a seller’s auction history and looking for an account which has bid on every or almost every auction of that seller. If there is someone who meets those characteristics, it is most likely a shill using that account to increase the price.

A shield can be spotted similarly to a shill. By doing a search of a person&#x27;s won auctions, it can be found out whether or not there is another account participating in the same auctions without ever winning anything. If there is, it is possible that the person is using a shield to help them become successful in auctions.

===Sale of stolen goods===
Online auction websites can be used by thieves or fences to sell stolen goods to unsuspecting buyers. According to police statistics, there were over 8000 crimes involving stolen goods, fraud, or deception reported on eBay in 2009. It has become common practice for organized criminals to steal in-demand items, often in bulk, then sell them online. It is thought to be a safer option than fencing stolen items due to the anonymity and worldwide market online auctions provide.

==Interests protection==

===Government===
Governments have identified and taken steps to ensure the safety of online auctions and protect the interests of their citizens, typically by setting up relevant departments to deal with it. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) takes responsibility for protecting consumers from unfair, fraudulent, and deceptive business practices. The FTC provides several resources for guidance on internet auction fraud and actively investigates fraud involving online auctions. According to the Internet Crime Report, online auction fraud ranks among the top complaints received by the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) provides information and advice on online auction fraud through its Scamwatch website. The ACCC actively monitors fraud in the online auction market and takes steps to combat it.

===Customers===
Fraud victims have volunteered to set up online communities The original intention of these communities is to comfort people, share their experiences for education and provide reliable intermediary services for certain traders. Some victims have also resorted to controversial methods of retaliation. Their actions include publicly revealing the personal information of identified scammers or disrupting transactions by blindly bidding up prices and then refusing to pay. These methods may inadvertently cause harm to ordinary sellers who are mistakenly identified as fraudsters.

===Platform===
Online auction platforms have made significant efforts to prevent fraud and protect their users. Once fraudulent behavior is identified, the platform can freeze the account of the relevant seller. But this can only passively punish accounts of people who have committed fraudulent behavior. Based on the characteristics of the internet, these people only need to register new accounts.

One of the most effective measures is the use of secure payment systems. These platforms force sellers to get payment through trusted payment gateways, thus providing additional security by acting as a middleman between buyers and sellers and increasing the cost to the fraudster of committing a violation. The current mainstream online platforms act more as &quot;intermediaries&quot; and collect deposits from sellers who sell large-value products. With this approach the money is transferred to the seller&#x27;s account after the ownership of the item is confirmed and transferred, ensuring the security of the transaction.

<text>Einsiedeln Abbey () is a Catholic monastery administered by the Benedictine Order in the village of Einsiedeln, Switzerland.

The Abbey of Einsiedeln is one of the most important baroque monastic sites and the largest place of pilgrimage in Switzerland.

The Black Madonna of Einsiedeln in the Chapel of Grace attracts around 800,000 pilgrims and tourists every year. The community of Benedictine monks has around 40 members. The monastery is not under the jurisdiction of a diocese or a bishop because it is a territorial abbey.

The abbey operates a private high school along with a winery, sawmill, restaurant and other small businesses in order to support itself.

== History ==
=== Origin of the monastery ===

The history of Einsiedeln Abbey starts with Meinrad of Einsiedeln. Born in 797 in Sulchen, he was educated at the abbey school on Reichenau Island in what is today Germany. Meinrad became a monk and was later ordained a priest. After gaining public attention for reportedly performing miracles, Meinrad established a hermitage in 828 in the Einsiedeln forest of Switzerland, searching for privacy. He was murdered by two robbers in January 861.

Over the next 80 years, other hermits occupied Meinrad&#x27;s hermitage. In 934 Eberhard, previously Provost of Strassburg, built the Einsiedeln abbey and church on the hermitage site, becoming its first abbot. According to legend, the church was consecrated in 948 in person by Jesus Christ in honor of his mother Mary. It was the beginning of the pilgrimage to the Chapel of the Saviour, which turned in the Middle Ages to a Marian pilgrimage.

In 965 Gregory, the third Abbot of Einsiedeln, was named a prince of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Otto I. His successor abbots would hold that title until the dissolution of the empire in 1806.

=== High and late Middle Ages ===
In 1226, after another fire, the church was enlarged. The lower church was built above the Chapel of the Saviour, which was incorporated into the new complex. This effect, of a sanctuary within a sanctuary, has been maintained in later restorations of the Chapel of Our Lady.

In the 13th century, the pilgrimage to the monastic compley became more popular, better structured and organized. The figure of the enthroned Madonna holding the baby Christ on her left knee, which appears on an abbey seal from 1239, is considered Einsiedeln&#x27;s oldest miraculous image.

=== Early modern times ===
During the early 16th century, the standards of discipline at Einsiedeln started to decline, but Ludovicus II, a monk of St. Gall who was Abbot of Einsiedeln from 1526 to 1544, restored a stricter observance. The abbey remained unaffected by the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland. Its leader, Huldrych Zwingli, had studied at the abbey for a period of time. Abbot Augustine I (1600–29) led the movement to create the Swiss Congregation of the Order of St. Benedict in 1602. Augustine established unrelaxed observance in the abbey and promoted a high standard of scholarship and learning amongst his monks.

The Einsiedeln abbey church was rebuilt by Abbot Maurus between 1704 and 1719 and the baroque ornamentation was completed in 1734. In 1798, the abbey was occupied by French revolution soldiers, losing its status as an independent principality. The clergy could return to the monastery in 1801. On February 19, 1803, the abbey was officially reinstalled by the Act of Mediation. However, the Chapel of Grace was only rebuilt in 1815-1817 with the remaining parts of the old structure in the neoclassical style.

=== 19th and 20th century ===
Because of the political uncertainties inside and outside the country in the 1840s, the Einsiedeln leadership became afraid that the abbey would be suppressed or dissolved. They sent a group of monks to southern Indiana in the United States to minister to German immigrants and develop a possible place of refuge. The monks started a new foundation, now Saint Meinrad Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Indiana.

There are a total of five monasteries in the USA that are linked to Einsiedeln by history:

* Saint Meinrad Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Indiana
* Subiaco Abbey in Logan County, Arkansas 
* St. Joseph Abbey in Saint Benedict, Louisiana
* Marmion Abbey in Aurora, Illinois
* Prince of Peace Abbey in Oceanside, California

A highlight in the history of the monastery was the visit of Pope John Paul II in the summer of 1984, who solemnly consecrated the new high altar in the lower choir on June 15.

== Marian veneration ==

In contrast to for example Lourdes, the pilgrimage in Einsiedeln does not go back to a Marian apparition, but to a monastic tradition.

The oldest surviving reference to the Einsiedeln pilgrimage dates back to the early 14th century. However, the pilgrimage itself is likely to be older. It was encouraged by the legend of the consecration of the angels, according to which the Einsiedeln Chapel of Grace was consecrated by Christ himself in 948. Originally, the Einsiedeln pilgrimage was therefore a pilgrimage to the church consecrated by Christ, which only gradually became a Marian pilgrimage with the rise of Marian devotion in the High Middle Ages. The miraculous consecration is commemorated every year on the Feast of the Consecration of the Angels on September 14.

The Middle Ages were the great age of pilgrimages. In addition to pilgrimages to Einsiedeln, many were also passing through on their way to Rome or Santiago de Compostela.

After the Reformation and especially in the Baroque period, Einsiedeln became more and more of a Marian pilgrimage site. After the great ecclesiastical crisis caused by the Reformation, the monastic community consolidated again and played a significant role in shaping Einsiedeln&#x27;s pilgrimage culture.

Nowadays, the monastery is visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from all over the world every year. The majority come from Switzerland and the surrounding countries, but pilgrims from Eastern and Central European countries are also well represented. In addition to the traditional religious pilgrims, there are also more and more visitors who come to the monastery and village for cultural reasons.

== Status today ==
=== Community ===
The Einsiedeln monastic community currently consists of 40 monks (as of October 2023). The average age (as well as the median) is comparatively low at just under 60 years due to the continuous arrival of new members in recent years.

Einsiedeln is still a territorial abbey, meaning that it is located in a territory that is not part of any diocese which the abbot governs &quot;as its proper pastor&quot; (Canon 370, &quot;Codex Juris Canonici&quot;) with the same authority as a diocesan bishop.

The head of the community has been Abbot Urban Federer since December 2013. As Abbot of Einsiedeln, he is a full member of the Swiss Bishops&#x27; Conference.

Located in separate cantons, Einsiedeln Abbey and Fahr Convent, a community of Benedictine nuns, form a double monastery, both under the authority of the male Abbot of Einsiedeln.

=== Library ===
The monastery&#x27;s library is rich in old books: it contains around 230,000 printed books, 1230 manuscripts and 1040 volumes of incunabula and early printed books. Between 500 and 800 books are added every year.

The library was founded in 934 and the monastery already had its own writing school in the mid-10th century; 64 manuscripts from this period are still preserved today. The scriptorium, established in 2022, is a reminder of this, where visitors can learn about the production of books in the Middle Ages and write with ink and quill themselves. The monastery was given its own printing press in 1664, where over a thousand titles were published by 1798. The library was last restored in 1998.

=== School ===
Einsiedeln Abbey School is a private and federally recognized Matura school in Einsiedeln with a history stretching back over 1,000 years. It is organized by the Benedictine monastery of Einsiedeln. Around 400 students attend the school, which is taught by around 50 teachers. Among them are also five priests.

The mission statement of the Abbey School is shaped by the Benedictine tradition. According to the current abbot of Einsiedeln Abbey, this is reflected in &quot;the most holistic humanistic education possible, which essentially includes the artistic dimension&quot;. The abbey school is thus intended to offer an alternative to the existing range of schools.

<doc id="840173" wikidata="Q4111556" url="?curid=840173" title="Greville Wynne">
<text>Greville Maynard Wynne (19 March 1919 – 28 February 1990) was a British engineer and businessman recruited by MI6 because of his frequent travel to Eastern Europe. He acted as a courier to transport top-secret information to London from the Soviet agent Oleg Penkovsky. 

Wynne and Penkovsky were both arrested by the KGB in November 1962, when some of the information their endeavours produced was of assistance to the West during the Cuban Missile Crisis. They were convicted of espionage. Penkovsky was executed the following year and Wynne was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. He was detained at Lubyanka prison. Struggling with deteriorating health, he was released in 1964 in exchange for the Soviet spy Konon Molody.

==Early life==
Wynne was born in Wrockwardine Wood, Telford, Shropshire, England, only son (an elder brother had died at the age of one year in 1915; he had three elder sisters) of Ethelbert Wynne and Ada, née Pritchard. He was raised in Ystrad Mynach, South Wales, with a &quot;modest background&quot;. His father was a foreman in an engineering workshop. He struggled with dyslexia and left school at 14 to work for an electrical contractor. He then worked at a telephone factory as an apprentice. Before the Second World War he studied engineering part-time at the University of Nottingham. After the war, he traded in electrical equipment, travelling often through Europe and India. Wynne married Sheila Beaton in 1946; the couple had a son, Andrew, born in 1952. His business extended into Eastern Bloc countries from 1955.

== MI6 ==
In November 1960, Wynne was recruited by MI6 and asked to make a sales trip to Moscow, where he made contact with Oleg Penkovsky, a high-ranking GRU officer. Penkovsky had made earlier offers to spy for the West. Wynne later became an intermediary and courier for Penkovsky, smuggling top-secret Soviet intelligence to London on return from his frequent trips to the USSR.

Wynne&#x27;s and Penkovsky&#x27;s espionage activities were discovered by the KGB. Both men were arrested in November 1962, around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Wynne and Penkovsky each pleaded guilty on 7 May 1963 and were sentenced four days later. Wynne was sentenced to eight years in prison. Penkovsky was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad, though Wynne believed he died by suicide in prison.

Wynne was held at the Lubyanka. In April 1964, amid British concerns for his deteriorating health, Wynne was released in exchange for the Soviet spy Konon Molody (also known as Gordon Lonsdale).
== Later life and death ==
After his release, Wynne returned to his business career. He and his wife Sheila divorced and he became estranged from his son and only child, Andrew. In 1970, Wynne married Johanna Herma Van Buren. They separated a few years before his death but were still legally married when he died.

On 23 May 1966, he appeared as himself in an episode of the American television series &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, receiving two of four possible votes. 

Wynne struggled with depression and alcoholism in the aftermath of imprisonment. He died of throat cancer at the Cromwell Hospital in London on 28 February 1990, aged 70.

==Questions over pre-Penkovsky MI5 work==
Later in life, Wynne wrote two books about his work for British intelligence: &quot;The Man from Moscow&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Man from Odessa&quot; (1981). In these books, Wynne claimed to have been recruited by MI5 as early as the Second World War, long before his work with Penkovsky. Historians question this account. The authors of &quot;The Spy Who Saved the World&quot; wrote that Wynne &quot;had no previous intelligence experience or training.&quot; Others have made similar assessments, stating that Wynne was a civilian at the time of his recruitment by MI6 in 1960.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
*Wynne was portrayed by David Calder in the 1985 BBC television serial &quot;Wynne and Penkovsky&quot;.
*He was portrayed by Peter Lindford in the 2007 BBC Television docudrama &quot;Nuclear Secrets&quot;.
*He was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in the 2020 film &quot;The Courier&quot;.

<text>Gerald Jinx &quot;Jerry&quot; Mouse is an American character and one of the two titular characters in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s series of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; theatrical animated short films and other animated media, usually acting as the protagonist opposite his rival Tom Cat. Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Jerry is an anthropomorphic (but usually silent) brown house mouse, who first appeared as a mouse named Jinx in the 1940 MGM animated short &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;. Hanna gave the mouse&#x27;s original name as &quot;Jinx&quot;, while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance.

==History==
===&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons===
The name &quot;Jerry&quot; was chosen by Geraint Rowlands, who submitted &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; as potential names for the duo after an important Loews Inc. distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;. While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s, Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected cat and mouse relationship. Instead of being a &quot;cowering victim&quot; of Tom, he took delight in besting, and even torturing, his feline frenemy (even if Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry). Hanna and Barbera considered Tom and Jerry &quot;the best of enemies&quot;, whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual caring and respect for one another.

In later &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, Jerry acquired a young ward: a small grey mouse called &quot;Tuffy&quot; or &quot;Nibbles&quot; depending upon the cartoon, who was left on Jerry&#x27;s doorstep as a foundling baby in the 1946 short &quot;The Milky Waif&quot;. Jerry and Tuffy were also featured together in a sub-series of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons set in 17th century France which featured the characters as musketeers. The first of these shorts, &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot;, won the 1951 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons.

Hanna and Barbera served as writer/directors of the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons until 1956, when they also became the producers. Fourteen &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons between 1940 and 1954 were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, with seven of the shorts winning that award. MGM shut down its animation department in 1957, but new &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were produced by Gene Deitch and later Chuck Jones during the 1960s. Jerry would also appear in later &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; productions made for television, a series of direct-to-video features, and &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;, a 1992 theatrical film. Later productions eschewed much of the violence the 1940s and 1950s shorts were known for, and in several of the television shows Jerry was given a red bowtie and a kinder disposition in &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;.

Tom and Jerry aren&#x27;t always enemies; they have been known to team up on occasion. The first Tom and Jerry short/film that Jerry was in is &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, and the last is &quot;The Karate Guard&quot;, the 163rd Tom and Jerry film. Jerry has been on the Tom and Jerry film series from 1940 to the present.

===&quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;===
On his own, Jerry Mouse appears in a fantasy sequence in the 1945 Gene Kelly MGM musical film &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;. Jerry appears as the young ruler of a kingdom where music is banned because he feels he lacks talent, and Kelly persuades the mouse into performing a song-and-dance number with him. Kelly and MGM had originally wanted Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse as Kelly&#x27;s dance partner for the sequence, but Disney was unwilling to license the character.

Hanna and Barbera achieved the effect of Kelly dancing with Jerry by rotoscoping: live-action plates of Kelly dancing alone were shot first, and the action traced frame by frame so that Jerry&#x27;s movements would match. The success of the animated segment of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, which was mentioned as &quot;stealing the show&quot; in contemporary trade reviews, led to two more live-action/animated projects for Hanna and Barbera and MGM: an underwater ballet sequence featuring both Tom and Jerry in the 1953 film &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot;, with Esther Williams, and the &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; sequence of Kelly&#x27;s 1956 film &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;.

===&quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;===
In 1990, this version of Jerry wears a red bowtie (just like what he used to have in the 1975 &quot;Tom and Jerry Show&quot;) and has a tuft of hair on his head. He often taunts Tom (as a kitten) any chance he gets. Sometimes, in a few episodes, he is friends with/allies of Tom.

Jerry has had a number of voice actors over the years. Ever since his debut in &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot; his vocal effects were provided by co-creator William Hanna during the Hanna-Barbera era. Harry E. Lang did Jerry&#x27;s vocal effects and speaking voice in the shorts &quot;The Lonesome Mouse&quot; (1943) and &quot;Mouse in Manhattan&quot; (1945). Sara Berner voiced Jerry in the short &quot;The Zoot Cat&quot; (1944), as well as &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945) in a dance sequence with him and Gene Kelly. A sequence in the short &quot;The Milky Waif&quot; (1946) features Jerry and Nibbles disguising themselves as a pair of black people, in which the former is voiced by Lillian Randolph (same voice as Mammy Two Shoes). Paul Frees did Jerry&#x27;s speaking voice in the shorts &quot;His Mouse Friday&quot; (1951) and &quot;Blue Cat Blues&quot; (1956). Manuel Paris did Jerry&#x27;s voice in the short &quot;Mucho Mouse&quot; (1957). When the MGM cartoon studio shut down in 1957 and Gene Deitch and European animation studio Rembrandt Studio took over, he and Allen Swift did Jerry&#x27;s voice during the 1961–62 era. During the Chuck Jones era in 1963–1967, his voice was provided by Mel Blanc, June Foray, Chuck Jones, and Abe Levitow. Terence Monk did his voice in the short &quot;The Cat Above and the Mouse Below&quot; (1964) and Dale McKennon did Jerry&#x27;s singing voice in &quot;Cat and Dupli-cat&quot; (1967). In &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; (1975), Jerry was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in &quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot; (1980–1982). Frank Welker voiced him in &quot;Tom and Jerry Kids&quot; (1990–1993), and &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring&quot; (2002). Dana Hill voiced Jerry&#x27;s voice in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; (1992).

Other voice actors include Jeff Bergman in a Cartoon Network Latin America bumper, Alan Marriott in &quot;Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry&quot; (2000) and &quot;Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers&quot; (2002), Marc Silk in &quot;Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers&quot; (2002; as Monster Jerry), Spike Brandt in &quot;The Karate Guard&quot; (2005), &quot;Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale&quot; (2007), &quot;Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2010), &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot; (2011), &quot;Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse&quot; (2012), &quot;Tom and Jerry&#x27;s Giant Adventure&quot; (2013), &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon&quot; (2014), &quot;Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest&quot; (2015), &quot;Tom and Jerry Back to Oz&quot; (2016), and &quot;Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2017), Sam Vincent in &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot; (2006-2008). In &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)&quot;, Jerry&#x27;s vocal effects are provided by the show&#x27;s sound designer Rich Danhakl and archival recordings of William Hanna from the original theatrical shorts. In &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry (2021 film)&quot;, his voice was provided by André Sogliuzzo and archived recordings of William Hanna.

On November 18, 2021, it was confirmed that Eric Bauza would be voicing the character on the 2022 fighting game, &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, which establishes Jerry&#x27;s original given name &quot;Jinx&quot; to be his middle name. In Cartoon Network in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, Jerry was voiced by Aya Yonekura.

==In popular culture==
Tom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot; from the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show from The Simpsons parodies Tom and Jerry, with its mouse character named Itchy.

Jerry has been variously credited as &quot;Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Mouse&quot; in the video game &quot;Multiversus&quot;, and &quot;Jerome A. Mouse&quot; in the credits to their 2020 feature film. Neither of these conflicting names is considered canon, according to leading animation historian Jerry Beck.

The stage name of Ukrainian singer Jerry Heil was derived from her use of the name &quot;Jerry Mouse&quot; on Russian social media service VK. 

The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei likened the rivalry between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran to Tom and Jerry, with Iran in the role of Jerry.

<text>CRUX is a lightweight x86-64 Linux distribution targeted at experienced Linux users and delivered by a tar.gz-based package system with BSD-style initscripts. It is not based on any other Linux distribution. It also utilizes a ports system to install and upgrade applications.

Although &quot;&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;cross,&quot; the choice of the name &quot;CRUX&quot; itself has no meaning. Per Lidén chose it because it &quot;sounded cool,&quot; and ends in &quot;X&quot; which puts it in line with various other Unix flavors such as IRIX, Ultrix, Mac OS X and IBM AIX.

==Installation==

CRUX does not include a GUI installation program. Instead, the user boots the kernel stored on either a CD or diskette; partitions the hard disk drive(s) to which the operating system will be installed (using a program such as fdisk or cfdisk); creates the appropriate file systems on the various partitions; mounts the CD or NFS share along with the partitions made previously for use by the package installation script; compiles a new kernel; and installs a bootloader, all via shell commands.

==Package management==
CRUX implements an infrastructure similar to that of BSD-based operating systems for package management. Packages consist of a Pkgfile (which is a shell script), any patches required to adjust the program to work, md5sum hashes used to verify the integrity of the downloaded files and a footprint file listing the files to be included in the packages. These files are downloaded from a CRUX software repository, compiled, and installed using the prt-get frontend to . The software sources are downloaded from the websites of their respective upstream at the address specified in the Pkgfile.

<text>The Tatung Einstein is an eight-bit home/personal computer produced by Taiwanese corporation Tatung, designed in Bradford, England at Tatung&#x27;s research laboratories and assembled in Bridgnorth and Telford, England. It was aimed primarily at small businesses.

== History ==

The Tatung Einstein TC-01 was released in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1984, and 5,000 were exported to Taipei later that year. A Tatung monitor (monochrome or colour) and dot matrix printer were also available as options, plus external disc drives and an 80 column display card. It was also capable of running ZX Spectrum software with the &quot;Speculator&quot; addon.

More expensive than most of its rivals, the Einstein was popular with contemporary programmers as a development machine but was commercially unsuccessful.

A later revised version, called the Tatung Einstein 256 and released in 1985, suffered a similar fate.

== Design ==
The machine was physically large, with an option for one or two built-in three-inch floppy disk drives manufactured by Hitachi. At the time, most home computers in the UK used ordinary tape recorders for storage. Another unusual feature of the Einstein was that on start-up the computer entered a simple machine code monitor, called MOS (Machine Operating System).

A variety of software could then be loaded from disk, including a CP/M-compatible operating system called Xtal DOS (pronounced &#x27;Crystal DOS&#x27;, created by Crystal Computers in Torquay), and a BASIC interpreter (Xtal BASIC). More than 400 software titles were released for the system, including about 120 games. Versions of popular software like DBase or WordStar were available. 

Thanks to the reliability of the machine, and ample memory, the machine proved useful by many software houses to use for programming, and then porting the code to the machines they were made for, namely the Spectrum 48k, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64. Eventually, it was superseded by the PC and Atari ST as the development systems of choice.

The follow on machine, the Einstein 256, basically was the same as the original, with improved video (Yamaha V9938) and a more slimline black case.

== Technical specifications ==
The machines were quite similar.

The Tatung Einstein TC-01 specifications are similar the MSX standard.

* CPU: Zilog Z80A @ 4 MHz
* ROM: 8K to 32K 
* RAM: 64 KB system; 16 KB video 
* Video: Texas Instruments TMS9129, 16 colours, 32 sprite planes
* Audio: AY-3-8910 (also reads the keyboard matrix)
* Z84C30 CTC
* Z84C20 PIO
* Intel 8251 SIO
* 1770 FDC 3&quot; floppy disk controllers
* Z80 &#x27;Tube&#x27; bus/interface
* Analogue joystick ports

The Tatung Einstein 256 was similar to the original with improved video (Yamaha V9938) and more RAM.

* RAM: 64K user; 192K video 
* Video: Yamaha V9938, 512 colours

<doc id="840184" wikidata="Q165367" url="?curid=840184" title="Hendrick Goltzius">
<text>Hendrick Goltzius (, ; born Goltz; January or February 1558 – 1 January 1617) was a German-born Dutch printmaker, draftsman, and painter. He was the leading Dutch engraver of the early Baroque period, or Northern Mannerism, lauded for his sophisticated technique, technical mastership and &quot;exuberance&quot; of his compositions. According to A. Hyatt Mayor, Goltzius &quot;was the last professional engraver who drew with the authority of a good painter and the last who invented many pictures for others to copy&quot;. In the middle of his life he also began to produce paintings.

==Biography==

Goltzius was born near Viersen in Bracht or Millebrecht, a village then in the Duchy of Julich, now in the municipality Brüggen in North Rhine-Westphalia. His family moved to Duisburg when he was 3 years old. After studying painting on glass for some years under his father, he learned engraving from the Dutch polymath Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, who then lived in Cleves. In 1577 he moved with Coornhert to Haarlem in the Dutch Republic, where he remained based for the rest of his life. In the same town, he was also employed by Philip Galle to engrave a set of prints of the history of Lucretia.

Goltzius had a malformed right hand from a fire when he was a baby (his drawing of it is at right), which turned out to be especially well-suited to holding the burin; &quot;by being forced to draw with the large muscles of his arm and shoulder, he mastered a commanding swing of the line&quot;.

In the 1580s, Goltzius with his friends van Mander and the painter Cornelis van Haarlem, founded an art academy in Haarlem in emulation of those in France and Bologna, where the human figure could be studied from life and artists could meet to discuss both practice and aesthetics.

At the age of 21, Goltzius married a widow eight or nine years his senior. Her money enabled him to establish an independent business at Haarlem, but the marriage itself was unhappy. Feeling that the unpleasant atmosphere at home had affected his health, he found it advisable in 1590 to make a tour through Germany to Italy, where he acquired an intense admiration for the works of Michelangelo. He returned to Haarlem in August 1591, considerably improved in health, and worked there until his death.

His portraits, though mostly miniatures, are masterpieces of their kind, both on account of their exquisite finish and as fine studies of individual characters. Of his larger heads, his life-size self-portrait is probably the most striking example.

Goltzius brought to an unprecedented level the use of the &quot;swelling line&quot;, where the burin is manipulated to make lines thicker or thinner to create a tonal effect from a distance. He also was a pioneer of the &quot;dot and lozenge&quot; technique, where dots are placed in the middle of lozenge-shaped spaces created by cross-hatching to further refine tonal shading.

Hollstein credits 388 prints to him, with a further 574 by other printmakers after his designs.

In his command of the burin, Goltzius is said to rival Dürer. He made engravings of Bartholomeus Spranger&#x27;s paintings, thus increasing the fame of the latter – and his own. Goltzius began painting at the age of forty-two; some of his paintings can be found in Vienna. He also executed a few chiaroscuro woodcuts. He was the stepfather of the engraver Jacob Matham. He died, aged 58, in Haarlem.

<text>Abraham Bloemaert (25 December 1566 – 27 January 1651) was a Dutch painter and printmaker who used etching and engraving. He initially worked in the style of the &quot;Haarlem Mannerists&quot;, but by the beginning of the 17th-century altered his style in line with the new Baroque style that was then developing. He mostly painted history subjects and some landscapes. He was an important teacher, who trained most of the Utrecht Caravaggisti.

==Life==
Bloemaert was born in Gorinchem, Habsburg Netherlands, the son of the architect Cornelis Bloemaert I, who moved his family to Utrecht in 1575, where Abraham was first a pupil of Gerrit Splinter (pupil of Frans Floris) and of Joos de Beer. From the age of 15 or 16, he spent three years in Paris (1581–1583), studying for six weeks under a &quot;Jehan Bassot&quot; (possibly Jean Cousin the Younger) and then under a &quot;Maistre Herry&quot;. While in the School of Fontainebleau he received further training from his fellow countryman Hieronymus Francken. He returned to Utrecht in 1583, just before the French Wars of Religion began, which destroyed much of the work at the Chateau of Fontainebleau.

When his father was appointed city architect (&quot;Stads-bouwmeester&quot;) in Amsterdam in 1591 Bloemaert accompanied him there. On his father&#x27;s death in 1593 he returned to Utrecht, where he set up a workshop and in 1594 became dean (&quot;deken&quot;) of the &quot;zadelaarsgilde&quot;. (As of 1367 painters were included in the saddlemakers&#x27; guild, with no Guild of St. Luke of their own.) However, in 1611, along with the two other leading Utrecht painters, Joachim Wtewael and Paulus Moreelse, he was one of the founders of the Utrecht Guild of Saint Luke (&quot;St Lucas-gilde&quot;), a new Utrecht painters&#x27; guild, and became its &quot;deken&quot; in 1618. Many of Bloemaert&#x27;s paintings were commissioned by Utrecht&#x27;s clandestine Catholic churches. He died in Utrecht.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, &quot;[Bloemaert] excelled more as a colourist than as a draughtsman, was extremely productive, and painted and etched historical and allegorical pictures, landscapes, still-life, animal pictures and flower pieces&quot;. In the first decade of the 17th-century, Bloemaert began formulating his landscape paintings to include picturesque ruined cottages and other pastoral elements. In these works, religious or mythological figures play a subordinate role. Country life was to remain Bloemaert&#x27;s favourite subject, which he depicted with increasing naturalism. He drew motifs such as peasant cottages, dovecotes and trees from life and then on his return to the studio worked them up into complex imaginary scenes.

Among his many pupils were his four sons, Hendrick, Frederick, Cornelis, and Adriaan (all of whom achieved considerable reputations as painters or engravers). The Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) also lists as his pupils: Jan Aerntsz de Hel, Abraham Jacobsz van Almeloveen, Cornelius de Beer, Nicolaes van Bercheyck, Jan van Bijlert, the two Boths, the two Honthorsts, Leonaert Bramer, Bartholomeus Breenbergh, Hendrick ter Brugghen, Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, Willem van Drielenburg, Wybrand de Geest, Nicolaus Knüpfer, Hendrik Munnicks, Frederick Pithan, Cornelis van Poelenburch, Henrik Schook, Anthoni Ambrosius Schouten, Robert Jansz Splinter, Matthias Stom, Herman van Swanevelt, Dirck Voorst, Quintijnus de Waerdt, Jan Baptist Weenix, and Peter Petersz van Zanen.

==Public collections==
Bloemaert is represented in numerous art collections including: the Detroit Institute of Arts, Michigan; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indiana; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery, The Hague; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City; Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minnesota; Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen; Musée du Louvre, Paris; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy; Museum of Grenoble; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Royal Academy of Arts, London; University of Rochester, New York; Bob Jones University, Greenville, South Carolina; Centraal Museum, Utrecht, Netherlands; Museum de Fundatie, Zwolle, Netherlands; Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio; Courtauld Institute of Art, London; Harvard University Art Museums, Massachusetts; Kunsthalle zu Kiel, Germany; and the Princeton University Art Museum, New Jersey.

<doc id="840191" wikidata="Q237284" url="?curid=840191" title="Sagittarius A*">
<text>Sagittarius A*, abbreviated as Sgr A* ( ), is the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. Viewed from Earth, it is located near the border of the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius, about 5.6° south of the ecliptic, visually close to the Butterfly Cluster (M6) and Lambda Scorpii.

The object is a bright and very compact astronomical radio source. The name Sagittarius A* distinguishes the compact source from the larger (and much brighter) Sagittarius A (Sgr A) region in which it is embedded. Sgr A* was discovered in 1974 by and Robert L. Brown, and the asterisk was assigned in 1982 by Brown, who understood that the strongest radio emission from the center of the galaxy appeared to be due to a compact non-thermal radio object.

The observations of several stars orbiting Sagittarius A*, particularly star S2, have been used to determine the mass and upper limits on the radius of the object. Based on mass and increasingly precise radius limits, astronomers have concluded that Sagittarius A* must be the central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way galaxy. The current best estimate of its mass is 4.297 million solar masses.

Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery that Sagittarius A* is a supermassive compact object, for which a black hole was the only plausible explanation at the time.

In May 2022, astronomers released the first image of the accretion disk around the horizon of Sagittarius A*, confirming it to be a black hole, using the Event Horizon Telescope, a world-wide network of radio observatories. This is the second confirmed image of a black hole, after Messier 87&#x27;s supermassive black hole in 2019. The black hole itself is not seen; as light is incapable of escaping the immense gravitational force of a black hole, only nearby objects whose behavior is influenced by the black hole can be observed. The observed radio and infrared energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole.

==Observation and description ==

On May 12, 2022, the first image of Sagittarius A* was released by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. The image, which is based on radio interferometer data taken in 2017, confirms that the object contains a black hole. This is the second image of a black hole. This image took five years of calculations to process. The data was collected by eight radio observatories at six geographical sites. Radio images are produced from data by aperture synthesis, usually from night-long observations of stable sources. The radio emission from Sgr A* varies on the order of minutes, complicating the analysis.

Their result gives an overall angular size for the source of . At a distance of , this yields a diameter of . For comparison, Earth is from the Sun, and Mercury is from the Sun at perihelion. The proper motion of Sgr A* is approximately −2.70 mas per year for the right ascension and −5.6 mas per year for the declination.
The telescope&#x27;s measurement of these black holes tested Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity more rigorously than has previously been done, and the results match perfectly.

In 2019, measurements made with the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-Plus (HAWC+) mounted in the SOFIA aircraft revealed that magnetic fields cause the surrounding ring of gas and dust, temperatures of which range from , to flow into an orbit around Sagittarius A*, keeping black hole emissions low.

Astronomers have been unable to observe Sgr A* in the optical spectrum because of the effect of 25 magnitudes of extinction (absorption and scattering) by dust and gas between the source and Earth.

==History==
In April 1933, Karl Jansky, considered one of the fathers of radio astronomy, discovered that a radio signal was coming from a location in the direction of the constellation of Sagittarius, towards the center of the Milky Way. The radio source later became known as Sagittarius A. His observations did not extend quite as far south as we now know to be the Galactic Center. Observations by Jack Piddington and Harry Minnett using the CSIRO radio telescope at Potts Hill Reservoir, in Sydney discovered a discrete and bright &quot;Sagittarius-Scorpius&quot; radio source, which after further observation with the CSIRO radio telescope at Dover Heights was identified in a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; as the probable Galactic Center.

Later observations showed that Sagittarius A actually consists of several overlapping sub-components; a bright and very compact component, Sgr A*, was discovered on February 13 and 15, 1974, by Balick and Robert L. Brown using the baseline interferometer of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The name Sgr A* was coined by Brown in a 1982 paper because the radio source was &quot;exciting&quot;, and excited states of atoms are denoted with asterisks.

Since the 1980s, it has been evident that the central component of Sgr A* is likely a black hole. In 1994, infrared and sub-millimetre spectroscopy studies by a Berkeley team involving Nobel Laureate Charles H. Townes and future Nobel Prize Winner Reinhard Genzel showed that the mass of Sgr A* was tightly concentrated and on the order of 3 million Suns.

On October 16, 2002, an international team led by Reinhard Genzel at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics reported the observation of the motion of the star S2 near Sagittarius A* throughout a period of ten years. According to the team&#x27;s analysis, the data ruled out the possibility that Sgr A* contains a cluster of dark stellar objects or a mass of degenerate fermions, strengthening the evidence for a massive black hole. The observations of S2 used near-infrared (NIR) interferometry (in the Ks-band, i.e. 2.1 μm) because of reduced interstellar extinction in this band. SiO masers were used to align NIR images with radio observations, as they can be observed in both NIR and radio bands. The rapid motion of S2 (and other nearby stars) easily stood out against slower-moving stars along the line-of-sight so these could be subtracted from the images.
The VLBI radio observations of Sagittarius A* could also be aligned centrally with the NIR images, so the focus of S2&#x27;s elliptical orbit was found to coincide with the position of Sagittarius A*. From examining the Keplerian orbit of S2, they determined the mass of Sagittarius A* to be solar masses, confined in a volume with a radius no more than 17 light-hours (). Later observations of the star S14 showed the mass of the object to be about 4.1 million solar masses within a volume with radius no larger than 6.25 light-hours (). S175 passed within a similar distance. For comparison, the Schwarzschild radius is . They also determined the distance from Earth to the Galactic Center (the rotational center of the Milky Way), which is important in calibrating astronomical distance scales, as . In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of a potential intermediate-mass black hole, referred to as GCIRS 13E, orbiting 3 light-years from Sagittarius A*. This black hole of 1,300 solar masses is within a cluster of seven stars. This observation may add support to the idea that supermassive black holes grow by absorbing nearby smaller black holes and stars.

After monitoring stellar orbits around Sagittarius A* for 16 years, Gillessen &quot;et al.&quot; estimated the object&#x27;s mass at solar masses. The result was announced in 2008 and published in &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; in 2009. Reinhard Genzel, team leader of the research, said the study has delivered &quot;what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that supermassive black holes do really exist. The stellar orbits in the Galactic Center show that the central mass concentration of four million solar masses must be a black hole, beyond any reasonable doubt.&quot;

On January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sgr A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sgr A*, according to astronomers.

On 13 May 2019, astronomers using the Keck Observatory witnessed a sudden brightening of Sgr A*, which became 75 times brighter than usual, suggesting that the supermassive black hole may have encountered another object.

In June 2023, unexplained filaments of radio energy were found associated with Sagittarius A*.

==Central black hole==
In a paper published on October 31, 2018, the discovery of conclusive evidence that Sagittarius A* is a black hole was announced. Using the GRAVITY interferometer and the four telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to create a virtual telescope in diameter, astronomers detected clumps of gas moving at about 30% of the speed of light. Emission from highly energetic electrons very close to the black hole was visible as three prominent bright flares. These exactly match theoretical predictions for hot spots orbiting close to a black hole of four million solar masses. The flares are thought to originate from magnetic interactions in the very hot gas orbiting very close to Sagittarius A*.

In July 2018, it was reported that S2 orbiting Sgr A* had been recorded at , or 2.55% the speed of light, leading up to the pericenter approach, in May 2018, at about (approximately 1,400 Schwarzschild radii) from Sgr A*. At that close distance to the black hole, Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity predicts that S2 would show a discernible gravitational redshift in addition to the usual velocity redshift. The gravitational redshift was detected, in agreement with the general relativity prediction within the 10 percent measurement precision.

The Sagittarius A* radio emissions are not centered on the black hole, but arise from a bright spot in the region around the black hole, close to the event horizon, possibly in the accretion disc, or a relativistic jet of material ejected from the disc. If the apparent position of Sagittarius A* were exactly centered on the black hole, it would be possible to see it magnified beyond its size, because of gravitational lensing of the black hole. According to general relativity, this would result in a ring-like structure, which has a diameter about 5.2 times the black hole&#x27;s Schwarzschild radius (10 μas). For a black hole of around 4 million solar masses, this corresponds to a size of approximately 52 μas, which is consistent with the observed overall size of about 50 μas, the size (apparent diameter) of the black hole Sgr A* itself being 20 μas.

Lower resolution observations revealed that the radio source of Sagittarius A* is symmetrical. Simulations of alternative theories of gravity depict results that may be difficult to distinguish from GR. A 2018 paper predicted an image of Sagittarius A* that is in agreement with observations. In particular, it explains the small angular size and the symmetrical morphology of the source.

The mass of Sagittarius A* has been estimated in two different ways:

#Two groups—in Germany and the U.S.—monitored the orbits of individual stars very near to the black hole and used Kepler&#x27;s laws to infer the enclosed mass. The German group found a mass of solar masses, whereas the American group found solar masses. Given that this mass is confined inside a 44-million-kilometre-diameter sphere, this yields a density ten times higher than previous estimates.
#More recently, measurement of the proper motions of a sample of several thousand stars within approximately one parsec from the black hole, combined with a statistical technique, has yielded both an estimate of the black hole&#x27;s mass at , plus a distributed mass in the central parsec amounting to . The latter is thought to be composed of stars and stellar remnants.
The comparatively small mass of this supermassive black hole, along with the low luminosity of the radio and infrared emission lines, imply that the Milky Way is not a Seyfert galaxy.

Ultimately, what is seen is not the black hole itself, but observations that are consistent only if there is a black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.

The European Space Agency&#x27;s gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL observed gamma rays interacting with the nearby giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2, causing X-ray emission from the cloud. The total luminosity from this outburst (≈1,5 erg/s) is estimated to be a million times stronger than the current output from Sgr A* and is comparable with a typical active galactic nucleus. In 2011 this conclusion was supported by Japanese astronomers observing the Milky Way&#x27;s center with the &quot;Suzaku&quot; satellite.

In July 2019, astronomers reported finding a star, S5-HVS1, traveling or 0.006 &quot;c&quot;. The star is in the Grus (or Crane) constellation in the southern sky, and about 29,000 light-years from Earth, and may have been propelled out of the Milky Way galaxy after interacting with Sagittarius A*.

Several values have been given for its spin parameter formula_1; some examples are Fragione &amp; Loeb (2020) formula_2&quot;,&quot; Belanger et al. (2006) formula_3, Meyer et al. (2006) formula_4, Genzel et al. (2003) formula_5, 
Daly (2019) formula_6, 
and Daly et al. (2023) formula_7. Daly et al. (2023) also found that the ratio of the black hole rotational mass component to the irreducible mass component of Sgr A* is formula_8, which indicates that the black hole is rotating with an angular velocity that is formula_9 of the maximum possible value, set by the speed of light. 
==Orbiting stars==

There are a number of stars in close orbit around Sagittarius A*, which are collectively known as &quot;S stars&quot;. These stars are observed primarily in K band infrared wavelengths, as interstellar dust drastically limits visibility in visible wavelengths. This is a rapidly changing field—in 2011, the orbits of the most prominent stars then known were plotted in the diagram at left, showing a comparison between their orbits and various orbits in the solar system. Since then, S62 has been found to approach even more closely than those stars.

The high velocities and close approaches to the supermassive black hole makes these stars useful to establish limits on the physical dimensions of Sagittarius A*, as well as to observe general-relativity associated effects like periapse shift of their orbits. An active watch is maintained for the possibility of stars approaching the event horizon close enough to be disrupted, but none of these stars are expected to suffer that fate.

, S4714 is the current record holder of closest approach to Sagittarius A*, at about , almost as close as Saturn gets to the Sun, traveling at about 8% of the speed of light. These figures given are approximate, the formal uncertainties being and . Its orbital period is 12 years, but an extreme eccentricity of 0.985 gives it the close approach and high velocity.

An excerpt from a table of this cluster (see Sagittarius A* cluster), featuring the most prominent members. In the below table, id1 is the star&#x27;s name in the Gillessen catalog and id2 in the catalog of the University of California, Los Angeles. a, e, i, Ω and ω are standard orbital elements, with a measured in arcseconds. Tp is the epoch of pericenter passage, P is the orbital period in years and Kmag is the infrared K-band apparent magnitude of the star. q and v are the pericenter distance in AU and pericenter speed in percent of the speed of light.

==Discovery of G2 gas cloud on an accretion course==
First noticed as something unusual in images of the center of the Milky Way in 2002, the gas cloud G2, which has a mass about three times that of Earth, was confirmed to be likely on a course taking it into the accretion zone of Sgr A* in a paper published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2012. Predictions of its orbit suggested it would make its closest approach to the black hole (a perinigricon) in early 2014, when the cloud was at a distance of just over 3,000 times the radius of the event horizon (or ≈260 AU, 36 light-hours) from the black hole. G2 has been observed to be disrupting since 2009, and was predicted by some to be completely destroyed by the encounter, which could have led to a significant brightening of X-ray and other emission from the black hole. Other astronomers suggested the gas cloud could be hiding a dim star, or a binary star merger product, which would hold it together against the tidal forces of Sgr A*, allowing the ensemble to pass by without any effect. In addition to the tidal effects on the cloud itself, it was proposed in May 2013 that, prior to its perinigricon, G2 might experience multiple close encounters with members of the black-hole and neutron-star populations thought to orbit near the Galactic Center, offering some insight to the region surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.

The average rate of accretion onto Sgr A* is unusually small for a black hole of its mass and is only detectable because it is so close to Earth. It was thought that the passage of G2 in 2013 might offer astronomers the chance to learn much more about how material accretes onto supermassive black holes. Several astronomical facilities observed this closest approach, with observations confirmed with Chandra, XMM, VLA, INTEGRAL, Swift, Fermi and requested at VLT and Keck.

Simulations of the passage were made before it happened by groups at ESO and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).

As the cloud approached the black hole, Daryl Haggard said, &quot;It&#x27;s exciting to have something that feels more like an experiment&quot;, and hoped that the interaction would produce effects that would provide new information and insights.

Nothing was observed during and after the closest approach of the cloud to the black hole, which was described as a lack of &quot;fireworks&quot; and a &quot;flop&quot;. Astronomers from the UCLA Galactic Center Group published observations obtained on March 19 and 20, 2014, concluding that G2 was still intact (in contrast to predictions for a simple gas cloud hypothesis) and that the cloud was likely to have a central star.

An analysis published on July 21, 2014, based on observations by the ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in Chile, concluded alternatively that the cloud, rather than being isolated, might be a dense clump within a continuous but thinner stream of matter, and would act as a constant breeze on the disk of matter orbiting the black hole, rather than sudden gusts that would have caused high brightness as they hit, as originally expected. Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas stream.

Andrea Ghez et al. suggested in 2014 that G2 is not a gas cloud but rather a pair of binary stars that had been orbiting the black hole in tandem and merged into an extremely large star.

<doc id="840195" wikidata="Q6477466" url="?curid=840195" title="Lake Quinsigamond">
<text>Lake Quinsigamond (also &quot;Long Pond&quot;) is a body of water situated between the city of Worcester and the town of Shrewsbury in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. It is long, between deep, and has a surface area of approximately . Lake Quinsigamond hosts 8 islands with the majority owned by private citizens. Two islands are connected to land via bridge. The largest island, Drake Island, is still state owned. Water from the lake empties into the Quinsigamond River in the Blackstone Valley.

== Bridging the lake ==
The lake&#x27;s long and narrow shape posed a challenge to settlers of the Worcester area in the 17th century since it was deeded by Peter Jethro and other Native Americans in 1665. Lacking modern bridging techniques, westward travelers had to ride around the lake&#x27;s northern and southern tips. At the turn of the 19th century, Isaiah Thomas, a Worcester resident, developed plans for a direct link between Worcester and Boston (plans that eventually became Route 9). Construction of this road was under the authority of the Worcester Turnpike Corporation (until 1841; thereafter, the city of Worcester). Like the settlers 150 years earlier, Thomas and company faced the problem of Lake Quinsigamond. The first span across the lake was a floating log bridge, built in 1806. This first attempt was unstable, often swaying under the weight of horse-drawn wagons. The floating bridge was broken apart by waves in 1806, and was rebuilt in the year 1807 as an interim solution.

The second bridge was an early suspension bridge, and was completed in early 1817. Nine wooden piers, built into the lakebed at regular intervals, held aloft a gravel-covered plank bridge. Due to the unstable nature of the lakebed, the nine piers settled at different levels, causing gaps to appear in the road surface. The piers and the bridge split apart and fell into the water on September 19, 1817. The collapse of the suspension bridge was quickly followed with a second floating bridge, this one lasting until 1861.

The first stable bridge over Lake Quinsigamond (the fourth such attempt overall) was an earthen causeway, finished in 1863. Formed from a mixture of rock, gravel and dirt, the causeway was the first span to not sway under heavy loads. The causeway effectively split the lake in half, stifling the nascent lakeside steamboat industry. Contemporary public opinion likened the causeway to an &#x27;eyesore&#x27; and an &#x27;abomination&#x27;. Despite these problems, the span survived into the early 20th century, when it was replaced by the current bridge. In ca. 1900, the causeway was expanded to include trolley tracks, linking downtown Worcester to the lakeside attractions.

A modern, two-lane bridge made of stone, cement and steel replaced the old causeway on July 31, 1919. Renovations completed in 1973 expanded the bridge to a four-lane roadway. At the north end of the lake, a second bridge was built to support Interstate 290.

The new Kenneth F. Burns Memorial Bridge opened November 1, 2015 and carries Route 9 over Lake Quinsigamond. The crossing is a two barrel steel arch bridge that consists of two separate structures supporting eastbound and westbound traffic. Each structure is an 870-foot-long, five-span, open spandrel steel-tied deck arch, supported on two concrete abutments and four perched pile caps. The two structures both carry three traffic lanes, a bike lane, and a pedestrian walkway, with overlooks provided for scenic views of the lake.

== Attractions on the lake ==

=== Historical ===

Most of the lakeside development occurred around the southern shores, due to the construction of the causeway in 1863. The causeway split the lake in half for those traveling by water, namely, steamboat cruises and competitive rowers. Lincoln Park, a family amusement park, opened on the Worcester (western) side of the lake in 1867; steamboat cruises began twenty years earlier, launched from the site of the Park. Horace H. Bigelow, a local businessman, opened a competing amusement park called White City on the Shrewsbury side in 1905. Both parks became famous for unique rides: Lincoln for the &#x27;Dummy Railroad,&#x27; a passenger train running between Union Station in Worcester and the Park; White City, for its artificial lake, Shoot-the-Chutes ride, and other water attractions.

By the 1940s, both parks began to suffer declines in attendance due to development elsewhere along the lake&#x27;s shores. White City, once a park that featured &#x27;50,000 Electric Lights,&#x27; shut down on Labor Day, 1960. Lincoln Park closed in 1961, and the White City property was sold in November of that same year. Both parks lost buildings due to suspicious fires during their final years.

=== Current ===
The buyer of the White City property, Albert Shore, developed the land into a shopping center and movie theater complex shortly after the amusement park&#x27;s closure. The retail complex still bears the White City name, though the movie theater, White City Cinemas, was shut down in recent years. An elder apartment complex now stands on the former site of Lincoln Park.

=== Quinsigamond State Park===
Quinsigamond State Park is located on the Worcester side, to the north and south of Route 9.

=== Ramshorn Island ===
Ramshorn Island is owned by the city of Worcester, and is open to the public. Its walking paths cover the circumference of the 1.5 acre island, which is located toward the western bank of the lake just south of the renovated Kenneth F. Burns Memorial Bridge. The island is only accessible by boat.

== Regattas on the lake ==
Competitive rowing teams first came to Lake Quinsigamond in 1857. Finding the lake ideal for such crew regattas, avid rowers established boating clubs on the lake&#x27;s shores, the first being the Quinsigamond Boating Club. More boating clubs and races followed, and soon many colleges (both local and abroad) held regattas on the lake, such as the New England Rowing Championships, the ECAC National Invitational Championship, the Eastern Sprints, the Big East Championship and the Patriot League Championship. The NEIRA championship regatta has been held on the lake since the 1950s and now features over 40 schools in 8+, 4+ and 1X divisions. Beginning in 1895, local high schools held crew races on the lake. In 1952, the lake played host to the National Olympic rowing trials. The Quinsigamond Rowing Association hosted the US Rowing Masters National Championship in 2005, 2012 and 2016.

== Mandaean ritual use ==
The Mandaean-American community of Worcester regularly performs masbuta (baptism) rituals in Lake Quinsigamond.

<text>Charles Frazier (born November 4, 1950) is an American novelist. He won the 1997 National Book Award for Fiction for &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frazier was born in Asheville, North Carolina, grew up in Andrews and Franklin, North Carolina, and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1973. He earned an M.A. from Appalachian State University in the mid-1970s, and received his Ph.D. in English from the University of South Carolina in 1986. A 1985 published work by Frazier was a trail guide to the Andes and environs for the Sierra Club.

Frazier taught English, first at University of Colorado Boulder, then English at North Carolina State University. His wife convinced him to quit in order to work full-time on his novel. His friend and fellow North Carolina novelist, Kaye Gibbons, presented his unfinished novel to her literary agency, which led to the publication of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;.

===Career===
&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; was his first novel, published in 1997 by Atlantic Monthly Press. It traces the journey of Inman, a wounded deserter from the Confederate army near the end of the American Civil War. It follows his harrowing journey from deserting the army to finding his way back to the woman he left behind, Ada, who waits for him, dealing with all kinds of hardships herself. The power of Ada and Inman&#x27;s love, and their dedication to reuniting, is the driving force of the novel, along with Frazier&#x27;s incorporation of historical context. The work is rich in the culture and sensibilities of the North Carolina mountains, and is based on local history and stories handed down by Frazier&#x27;s father about Frazier&#x27;s great-great-uncle, William Pinkney &quot;Pink&quot; Inman (1839- 6 February 1865). Inman, who was from Haywood County, the area around Cold Mountain in western North Carolina, served in the Confederate Army, from which he deserted after being wounded twice, and is buried in the Bethel Community Cemetery, Bethel, Haywood County, North Carolina. &quot;Pink&quot; Inman served as a private in Company F of the 25th North Carolina Infantry, and his regiment did participate in the fighting in the Siege of Petersburg, including the Battle of the Crater.

&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; won the 1997 U.S. National Book Award
and was adapted as a 2003 film of the same name by Anthony Minghella.

Frazier&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Thirteen Moons&quot;, published in 2006, traces the story of one man across a century of change in America. Also set in western North Carolina, the novel traces one white man&#x27;s involvement with the Cherokee Indians just before, during and after their removal to Oklahoma. It is a story of struggle and triumph against the emerging U.S. government&#x27;s plan to remove native Cherokee people to Oklahoma. Based on the success of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, Frazier was offered an $8 million advance for &quot;Thirteen Moons&quot;.

Frazier&#x27;s 2011 book, &quot;Nightwoods&quot;, takes place in the 20th century, although the setting is still the Appalachian Mountains.

Frazier&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Varina&quot;, is based on the life of Varina Davis, First Lady of the Confederate States of America. It was published in 2018.

Frazier&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;The Trackers&quot;, follows a painter during the Great Depression who tracks down a woman with a valuable painting.

<doc id="840200" wikidata="Q2498822" url="?curid=840200" title="Assassin's Apprentice">
<text>Assassin&#x27;s Apprentice is a fantasy novel by American writer Robin Hobb, the first book in &quot;The Farseer Trilogy.&quot; It was Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden&#x27;s first book under this pseudonym, and was published in 1995. The book was written under the working title &quot;Chivalry’s Bastard&quot;.

The novel covers the early life of FitzChivalry, a royal bastard living in Buckkeep Castle as he begins his training as an assassin and successfully safeguards the throne from his over-ambitious uncle Regal, almost at the cost of his life. The stories of characters found in the &quot;Farseer Trilogy&quot; continue in the &quot;Tawny Man Trilogy&quot; and &quot;the Fitz and the Fool Trilogy&quot;. Other series, &quot;The Liveship Traders&quot; and &quot;The Rain Wild Chronicles&quot;, are set in the same world and in the same timeframe, with some crossover.

==Plot summary==
A six-year-old boy is taken by his maternal grandfather to the Farseers&#x27; army base in Moonseye, the Six Duchies&#x27; outpost on the border of the Mountain Kingdom. His grandfather says he is King-in-Waiting Chivalry&#x27;s bastard son. The boy is brought to Prince Verity, the second Son of King Shrewd who is currently in command of Moonseye. Verity orders that the boy be given into the care of Burrich, Chivalry&#x27;s right-hand man and stableman, who calls the boy, who does not know his own name, &quot;Fitz.&quot; With Burrich, Fitz travels to Buckkeep, the seat of the Farseer throne. Before Fitz arrives, Chivalry abdicates from the post of King-in-Waiting so that there will not be uncertainty about his bastard son&#x27;s claim to the throne. Chivalry retires to the royal holdings of Withywoods with his wife Lady Patience without ever meeting Fitz. Chivalry&#x27;s and Verity&#x27;s younger half-brother, Prince Regal, despises Fitz and treats him badly when he arrives.

Burrich is left with the task of raising Fitz and trains him as a stable boy. Fitz is treated poorly for being a bastard, so he becomes a close friend of a young dog named Nosy. Fitz possesses what is known as Wit, an ancient and distrusted magic which allows him to communicate telepathically with animals. He &#x27;bonds&#x27; with Nosy, but this is discovered by Burrich. With apparent disgust, he takes Nosy away, thus breaking the bond, and warns Fitz not to use the Wit, which is widely seen as a perversion. The only other companionship Fitz finds is with children living in Buckkeep town — in particular, a girl called Molly.

Fitz is desperately lonely and seemingly has no prospects. However, he catches the attention of King Shrewd, who sees that a bastard can be either a threat or an asset to the royal line. Fitz swears fealty to the king. He is taken into the castle proper and is schooled, taught combat skills, and develops a sense of loyalty to the Farseer line, especially King-in-Waiting Verity. One night he is introduced to a recluse named Chade Fallstar, who is a skilled assassin and spy. Fitz agrees to secretly learn Chade&#x27;s skills and complete minor assassin work for King Shrewd. Meanwhile, Chivalry dies when thrown from a horse, but it is strongly suspected that Queen Desire, King Shrewd&#x27;s second wife and Regal&#x27;s mother, has had him assassinated. The widowed Lady Patience arrives at Buckkeep, where she and Fitz become close, and he adopts the name &quot;FitzChivalry.&quot; Lady Patience gives Fitz a puppy, which he names Smithy and secretly forms a Wit bond with.

The coastal regions of the Six Duchies are being attacked by Outislanders known as the Red-Ship Raiders. The Raiders rampage through villages and towns, killing and taking hostages while stealing little, making their attacks seem to lack a motive. The hostages are returned, reduced to a brutal, emotionless state driven only by desire; they are named the Forged Ones. Forged Ones become robbers that plunder the countryside; Fitz is ordered by Chade to secretly kill many of them, and he finds he cannot sense them with his Wit at all. Verity fights the Raiders with the Skill, a magic found in the Farseer bloodline which allows its users to share thoughts and strength, which weakens him. Fitz becomes &quot;King&#x27;s Man&quot; to Verity, allowing Verity to link with him to draw out Skill strength for his own use.

Fitz is made part of a class of students to be taught in the Skill to help Verity. The teacher, Galen, despises Fitz, treating him without respect and abusing the students. He tries to kill Fitz, then, with more success, sabotages his Skill training with mental blocks. During the last test of Galen&#x27;s Skill classes, Galen sends Fitz to Forge, ostensibly to see if he can use the Skill to get back. Fitz is attacked by Forged Ones, although he manages to return safely. While he is away, Galen arranges an assassination attempt on Burrich which Fitz witnesses through Smithy&#x27;s eyes. Smithy saves Burrich but is killed.

To gain allies against the Raiders, Prince Verity is to be married to Princess Kettricken of the neighboring Mountain Kingdom. Fitz travels there with orders from Shrewd to assassinate Kettricken&#x27;s brother, Prince Rurisk, to bring Verity closer to the throne, based on information from Regal. However, this is compromised when Regal reveals Fitz&#x27;s secret mission to Kettricken while drunk and Regal&#x27;s information proves to be false. Fitz discovers a plan to steal the throne for Regal with the help of Galen, who tries to assassinate Verity using the Skill. Rurisk is poisoned and killed, leaving Kettricken the sole heir of the Mountain Kingdom. Fitz is poisoned by Regal but manages to contact Verity using the Skill to help him kill Galen. Fitz is rescued by his dog Nosy, who was not killed by Burrich, but sent to the Mountain Kingdom as a gift. Fitz recovers slowly, with lasting effects on his health. He laments the death of Nosy during that event and the pain of an older narrator at writing this.

<text>Royal Assassin is a fantasy novel by American writer Robin Hobb, the second book in &quot;The Farseer Trilogy&quot;. It was published in 1996.

==Plot summary==
FitzChivalry has survived Prince Regal&#x27;s attempt to poison him, but is left weak and prone to unpredictable seizures. Fitz vows to never return to Buckkeep and his king. A vision of Molly fending off an attack by Red-ship Raiders convinces him otherwise, and he returns to the royal court of the Six Duchies.

At Buckkeep, Fitz is immediately embroiled in the intrigues of the royal family. Molly is alive, but she has been left a pauper by her father&#x27;s death and debts, and serves as a lady&#x27;s maid at Buckkeep. She and Fitz admit their love for each other and begin a relationship. When Fitz approaches King Shrewd for permission to marry, Shrewd reveals he has already pledged Fitz to the daughter of a duke. Fitz and Molly are left to conduct their courtship in secret, not only because of Shrewd&#x27;s command, but to keep Molly safe from Fitz&#x27;s enemies at the court.

King-in-Waiting Verity is consumed by the need to protect the Duchies&#x27; coast from the Red-ships, using his Skill to stave off Raider attacks, but failing to give attention to Kettricken, his new queen. King Shrewd suffers a mysterious wasting disease whose pain only mind-clouding drugs can abate, which Fitz suspects is the doing of Regal and his followers. Bands of Forged Ones begin to converge on Buckkeep, which Fitz secretly assassinates. Fitz rescues a young wolf, Nighteyes, and forms a Wit bond with him despite the danger of discovery. Regal and his lackeys come close to discovering that Fitz is Witted, and Fitz struggles to use the Skill to guard his mind.

After their relationship is strained by Fitz&#x27;s duties and inability to marry her, Molly tells him that she is leaving him and Buck forever for the sake of another. Fitz desperately reveals his biggest secret, that he is an assassin. Molly is instead repulsed and rejects Fitz with finality. Galen&#x27;s Skill coterie is supposed to help Verity fight the Raiders, but unsent messages and late warnings leave the coastal Duchies easy prey. Verity decides to journey to the mountains to seek the Elderlings, legendary beings that defended the Six Duchies in the past. This leaves Regal free to begin amassing power and loyalty to himself. Shrewd grows more weak and addled. Even the Fool is not safe from Regal, though he hints to Fitz that he has a great destiny. Fitz and Kettricken leave to quell a Raider attack on the coast. While they are gone, Regal announces that word has come that Verity is dead, and makes himself King-in-Waiting.

Using his mostly uncontrollable Skill, Fitz discovers that Verity is still alive, but to say this in the court where Regal now holds power would mean death. After an attempt is made on the life of Verity&#x27;s unborn heir, Fitz and his mentors Chade and Burrich make plans to spirit King Shrewd and Kettricken, now pregnant, safely out of Regal&#x27;s reach. Shrewd dies in an attempt to Skill to Verity before the plans can be carried out. However, Fitz gets a glimpse of the true source of the King&#x27;s long illness and death: Serene and Justin, two members of the coterie, have been using their Skill to slowly drain King Shrewd&#x27;s life away. Fitz takes the King&#x27;s blade and immediately assassinates Serene, then hunts down and kills Justin in front of much of the court. Meanwhile, Kettricken manages to escape Buck with the Fool.

Fitz is imprisoned and accused of homicide, regicide, and exposed for using the Wit. Regal, in an attempt to get Fitz to confess to his alleged crimes, tortures Fitz both physically and mentally by having him beaten while a member of the coterie, Will, assaults Fitz with the Skill. Fitz, knowing his mind and body cannot sustain any more punishment, uses the Wit to leave his body behind and join with his wolf, Nighteyes.

After his death, Fitz is publicly pronounced guilty of all charges, and his body is buried by his last remaining supporter, Lady Patience. However, Burrich and Chade exhume Fitz&#x27;s body and, after much coaxing, convince him to leave Nighteyes&#x27; mind and go back into his own body. Looking back on his past, an older Fitz laments the loss of freedom and simplicity he experienced as a wolf.

==Reception==

Of the book, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; stated the novel is a &quot;spellbinding installment, built of patient detail, believable characters, and mature plotting—though, at an unwarranted 608 pages, there are ominous signs that Hobb&#x27;s beginning to lose control of her narrative.&quot;

<doc id="840203" wikidata="Q1585469" url="?curid=840203" title="Shadow King">
<text>The Shadow King (Amahl Farouk) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, primarily as an enemy of the X-Men. His nemesis is the X-Men&#x27;s leader, Professor X, while he also figures into the backstory of the X-Man Storm. As originally introduced, Farouk was a human mutant from Egypt who used his vast telepathic abilities for evil, taking the alias Shadow King. Later writers established Farouk as the modern incarnation of an ancient evil entity.

The Shadow King has appeared in various adaptations of &quot;X-Men&quot; stories. The character&#x27;s live-action debut is as the primary antagonist in the television series &quot;Legion&quot;, portrayed by Aubrey Plaza and Navid Negahban.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Chris Claremont and illustrator/co-writer John Byrne, the character the Shadow King first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #117 (January 1979) as the telepathic mutant Amahl Farouk.

&quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Men: True Friends&quot; reveal the Shadow King to be an entity of the astral plane which has existed since the dawn of humanity, an ethereal demon preferring to enslave the bodies of telepaths and psychics and use their capabilities to enslave others. As a side effect of its greed, hedonism and lack of self-control, the Shadow King&#x27;s long-term telepathic hosts are often morbidly obese.

==Fictional character biography==
The Shadow King&#x27;s origins are unclear. All that is known is that he was living in Morocco until the 1800s before taking Farouk as a host. He claims to be a multiversal manifestation of the dark side of the human consciousnesses, spawned by the first nightmare, and has since been feeding on the shadows in their souls, transferring from host to host since the dawn of humanity.

===As Amahl Farouk in the 1930s===
The Shadow King was known as Amahl Farouk in 1931, working for two of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s special agents (Wolfgang von Strucker and Geist). Von Strucker and Geist planned to dethrone King Edward of the U.K. and replace him with a fascist ruler sympathetic to Hitler. When Farouk conducted a mystical ceremony, he accidentally brought back Phoenix Force host Rachel Summers and her teammate Shadowcat (also known as Kitty Pryde). Von Strucker began to doubt Farouk&#x27;s abilities. The Shadow King quickly possessed Rachel Summers and, as Shadowcat escaped, allied herself with Alasdhair Kinross. Farouk kidnapped the heir to the throne, Lilibet, and fled to Edinburgh. When Shadowcat tried to reach Summers telepathically, she found Farouk in control. Pryde surprised Farouk by calling him &quot;Shadow King&quot;, enabling her to escape. Farouk took control of Kinross and tried to kill them both, but Pryde used her phasing powers to disrupt Kinross&#x27;s nervous system and knock him out. 
Although Farouk was going to sacrifice Kinross to demons in return for a spell which would annihilate the British monarchy, he was interrupted by Kitty and his crystal knife shattered. The demons entered Farouk&#x27;s body, overpowering him. He began dispersing energy, killing all the Nazi soldiers; von Strucker accused him of treason and tried to shoot him. Farouk transformed into the Shadow King and tried to force Pryde and Kinross to fight, but they were saved by the young Logan. Phoenix unleashed her power on Farouk, but she was subdued and possessed. Lilibet escaped, fleeing to Holyrood House. Farouk possessed the house&#x27;s servants and sent them and Phoenix in pursuit. Logan ambushed Farouk, von Strucker and Geist, but Farouk had Summers and the servants attack him. Farouk then possessed Pryde and Lilibet. 
Pryde began talking about the future and the fall of Hitler; Lilibet attacked Farouk, disabling him enough for Pryde to disrupt his nervous system (stunning them both and giving Summers time to regain control of herself). Farouk recovered and tried to retake his prisoners, but Phoenix fought on the astral plane. Phoenix was going to kill him when Pryde struck them with the Sword of Scones, causing them to return to their bodies; Farouk&#x27;s body was supposedly destroyed by an energy blast from the sword but later when questioned by Rachel if they had killed Farouk, Pryde reveals that they had for the moment only weakened him.

===Confrontation with Charles Xavier===
In 1971, Farouk returned and met V-Battalion leader James Watkins Jr. Watkins offered him V-Battalion support if Farouk could obtain information about the Everlasting. Farouk gave Watkins the name of Marduk.

Farouk became a crime lord in Egypt, controlling Cairo&#x27;s Thieves Quarter, where a young Charles Xavier&#x27;s pocket was picked by the child Ororo Munroe. After Xavier stopped her and retrieved his wallet, he was struck by a bolt of psionic energy. When he recovered, he discovered that the source of the attack was a nearby tavern, where he met Farouk. Sitting at separate tables, they conversed telepathically. Farouk told Xavier that he sensed another telepath nearby, and the attack was a warning to stay clear of the area. 
He unsuccessfully tried to persuade Xavier to join him in his criminal activities; Xavier believed that people with such gifts should use them to better the world. They assumed astral form, and Xavier defeated Farouk on the astral plane with a fatal psionic attack. Farouk was Xavier&#x27;s first encounter with an evil mutant, which led to the formation of the X-Men. His psyche still on the Astral plane, Farouk awaited another chance to fight Xavier (whom he now feared).

===New Mutants===
The Shadow King became aware of a young mutant, Karma, a member of the New Mutants with the psychic ability to possess other beings. In one of the team&#x27;s earliest missions, Karma was apparently killed in an explosion at the Viper&#x27;s hideout. However, the Shadow King used Karma&#x27;s powers against her to possess her.

As Karma, the Shadow King rebuilt his worldwide empire while indulging his gluttony through her body. He used her to control the Gladiators, a group of mutants, by using a holographic image of leader Alexander Flynn.

The Shadow King used the Gladiators to abduct Magma and Sunspot, forcing them to fight in an arena until teammates Cannonball and Magik, along with Shadowcat and Dazzler, tried to rescue them. In their battle to escape the Gladiators, Cannonball and Shadowcat recognized their obese antagonist as Karma (not realizing that she was controlled by the Shadow King).

The team followed Karma to Madripoor, where they were subjected to Karma&#x27;s mind control, except for Magik and Mirage. The remaining New Mutants and Storm fought their teammates in Cairo, where Karma took control of Storm and Mirage. Magik, realizing that Karma was possessed by the Shadow King, released her teammates from Karma&#x27;s control and Karma from the Shadow King. After losing his host, the Shadow King transferred to Cypher. Karma challenges him to a psychic duel. She wins and Shadow King flees to the astral plane.

===Muir Island saga===
The Shadow King resurfaced during the &quot;Muir Island Saga&quot; many years later in the body of deceased FBI agent Jacob Reisz when Storm had been sent back to childhood by the Nanny and woke up with amnesia. On Muir Island, he also controlled Moira MacTaggert and Valerie Cooper, after which he sent Cooper to kill Mystique. Shadow King attacked and possessed the telepath Legion and used Cerebro to look for Storm.
The Shadow King set a trap to capture Storm. When he tried to possess her mind she involuntarily hit him with a lightning bolt, and he soon found her with Gambit. They worked together to fight him, escaping with the Shadow King&#x27;s hounds in pursuit. Mystique defeated Valerie Cooper and impersonated her, appearing on television to report Mystique&#x27;s death. Part of Carol Danvers separated from Rogue and traveled to Muir Island, where she was forced to fight Legion and Moira MacTaggert. Although she defeated them, she was possessed by the Shadow King. He compelled her to go to the Savage Land to find Rogue, but she was defeated on arrival by Magneto. The Shadow King, with his ambitious schemes, was afraid of being identified by other telepaths. He needed a nexus between the astral and psionic planes to generate a disturbance which would affect other telepaths. Polaris&#x27; powers had been recently altered by Zaladane, and he chose Polaris as his nexus.

Jean Grey tried to access the astral plane with Cerebro, but the Shadow King overrode Cerebro&#x27;s defenses and noticed that Jean had lost her telepathic powers and was helpless. He tried to turn her into his Shadow Queen, but Psylocke, unaware of who he was, threatened him with her psi-blade but ended using it on Jean instead, returning her to the physical world; however, they could not remember the details of the encounter and his identity was not yet compromised. His control over Muir Island was only uncovered when Professor X probed Colossus&#x27; mind after the latter tried to kill him.

The X-Men sent a task force which included Storm, Forge, Gambit, Banshee, Wolverine, and Jubilee to remove his influence. The Shadow King sent his slaves to defend the island, and they defeated the invaders. Xavier understood that he needed a human host and a nexus to continue his exploits, and planned to cut both the links. Mystique revealed herself and shot Jacob Reisz in the head, destroying his brain and killing the Shadow King&#x27;s human host. X-Factor discovered that his nexus was Polaris, but the Shadow King took possession of Legion. He ordered the slaves to hide underground because he was going to use Legion&#x27;s power to destroy the surface of Muir Island. Jean Grey&#x27;s telekinesis protected X-Factor and the X-Men.

Xavier then used Jean as a psi-anchor to fight the Shadow King in the astral plane, but he was defeated; reveling in making Xavier suffer, he issued psychic attacks so intense that they manifested as physical damage, breaking Xavier&#x27;s legs and crippling him in the process. Archangel, Colossus, Cyclops, and Storm joined Jean in the astral plane to help Xavier, unaware of Legion&#x27;s body nearby. Although they gave Xavier willpower and energy, the possessed Legion destroyed a large swath of Muir island; upon awakening, Xavier acknowledges that his physical damage has returned him to a paraplegic state. Forge uses Psylocke&#x27;s psi-blade on Polaris, breaking the Shadow King&#x27;s link to the nexus, after which his energy dissipated overcoming the X-Men. Xavier and Jean tried to absorb whatever they could and shield the others. Xavier offered the Shadow King a chance to redeem himself, but he opted for the void and Legion was left in a coma.

===Psi-War===
After the Onslaught incident in which Charles Xavier lost his powers, the Shadow King could return to the physical world since the psionic plane had lost its guardian. Posing as &quot;Ananasi&quot;, the Shadow King took over the African tribe who worshiped Storm. After attacking one of her relatives, Psylocke took Storm to the astral plane to fight &quot;Ananasi&quot; only to find the villagers’ minds set up in a distinct pattern. Before they can discern the reasoning, &quot;Ananasi&quot; attacks Psylocke and brings up her past failures and how she was always considered a redundant Jean Grey-wannabe. Ainet finds Storm and tells her the truth, but &quot;Ananasi&quot; buries Storm under bones of her dead friends before she can tell Psylocke the truth. Psylocke falls into Ananasi’s trap and accidentally hits one of the villagers with her psi-blade. This caused a chain reaction that cripples the entire psionic plan itself, damaging the collective subconscious of every being on Earth (the basis of the psi-plane) as well as all psi-sensitive in the corporeal world. Humans experienced &quot;déjà vu&quot;, nightmares, migraines or nosebleeds, and those born with psionic, telepathic or intuitive abilities were maimed; Jean and Nate Grey, Cable, Emma Frost, Chamber and Bianca LaNiege were devastated. &quot;Maddie&quot; Pryor (Nate Grey&#x27;s psionic construct from Madelyne Pryor&#x27;s psionic remnants) was obliterated, and Dr. Strange and Spider-Man were also affected while Psylocke is left as a discombobulated mess, as &quot;Ananasi&quot; reveals himself to be the Shadow King, now free of any opposition on the Psionic Plane. With the world&#x27;s telepaths crippled, the Shadow King ascends to dominance and, one by one, begins to corrupt mankind. He explains to Psylocke that although he was defeated and thought dead by Charles Xavier at Muir Island, as long as one dark thought exists in man, he can live. He went into hibernation, for the lack of a better word. He eventually bids her farewell forever as he teleports away and Psylocke turns to stone and then falls apart. Yet the Crimson Dawn saves Psylocke once again and resurrects her, this time with an all black psi-form and the ability to command the shadows of the Psionic Plane, which allow her to go undetected by the Shadow King. She eventually confronts the Shadow King and pretends to be tempted by his offer to become the Shadow Queen to distract him while Storm freed the other X-Men. However Farouk saw through the ruse; Psylocke sent the X-Men to the physical world and takes the fight directly to the Shadow King, who stretches his powers to the maximum to infect every mind on Earth. Psylocke is intoxicated by the power, but keeps her focus and discovers that the Shadow King has left his nexus, the soul of every person on the Psionic Plane, exposed as his body unravels to reach every mind. Psylocke uses her shadows to contain the nexus and the Shadow King is trapped, but only as long as Psylocke focuses her telepathy on him, which means she can never use her powers again or else he will be set free. Psylocke leaves the Psionic Plane for the last time and reveals what happened to Storm.

Sometime later the Shadow King reached Psylocke&#x27;s mind when she&#x27;s forced to use Cerebro to cleansed Logan of the Death persona with a little push from each of Logan&#x27;s closest friends, but Archangel experienced a metamorphosis of his own from his close contact to Apocalypse&#x27;s handiwork. The Shadow King eventually managed to convince Psylocke to release him in order to help Archangel but before she reaches him, Archangel himself mysteriously appears on her mind and stop her from setting him free, sending the Shadow King back to his prison when Psylocke disconnected herself from Cerebro.

===Freedom===
The Shadow King was eventually released from his prison when Psylocke perished in combat with the mutant hunter, Vargas. Once again free, he possessed the Reavers and attempted to attack the X-Men. However, Rogue used her acquired memories as well as Sage&#x27;s computer like mind and attacked the Shadow King, binding his core as Psylocke had done.

===New Excalibur===
Due to the events of House of M, the Shadow King was released from his prison and was able to escape to an alternate reality, Earth-6141. Once there, he possessed their version of Professor X and then corrupted the original X-Men (whom he called the Dark X-Men). He maintained constant telepathic contact and control over them and forced them to kill all the heroes of their world. The Scarlet Witch&#x27;s Decimation Wave enabled the Shadow King to bring himself and his team to Earth-616 in order to gain revenge on those who had crossed him. He tried to kill Captain Britain with the controlled New Excalibur, but was again defeated by Psylocke (who was revived by her brother, Jamie Braddock). The Dark X-Men tried to free Xavier from his prison with the help of Lionheart. Lionheart sealed the Shadow King in the Dark Xavier&#x27;s body, releasing the Shadow-X from his control and killed Dark Xavier therefore sending the Shadow King back to the Astral plane.

===X-Men: Worlds Apart===
The Shadow King reappeared in Wakanda, where he killed a Wakandan priest and framed former New X-Men member Gentle. He then controlled Black Panther to confront his longtime enemy (and T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s wife) Storm. The Shadow King intended to break Storm psychologically, forcing her to choose between the X-Men and her husband. He forced Cyclops to attack Emma Frost and the rest of the X-Men in California and forced the Black Panther to wreak havoc in Africa. While Storm raced to save the Black Panther and the X-Men, she recognized a third option: to take down the one responsible for making her choose. Storm defeated the Black Panther and flew with Gentle to San Francisco, taking down Gentle and the rest of the active X-Men (controlled by the Shadow King). She struck Cyclops (the Shadow King&#x27;s host) with a bolt of lightning, stopping his heart and forcing the Shadow King to possess Storm. This was a trap; when he entered Storm&#x27;s mind, the Shadow King found the panther god Bast waiting for him. Storm revealed that she allowed the Wakanda panther god to hide in her mind to avenge the Shadow King for violating T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s mind. Bast essentially and literally devoured the Shadow King&#x27;s astral form. Farouk&#x27;s plan to cut Storm off from her relationships instead strengthened them.

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
The Shadow King&#x27;s nexus survived however and when he recuperated he took over a military base&#x27;s nuclear facility to use its missiles, aiming them at Utopia and New York. The X-Force headed to the military base after losing contact with Deadpool (who was investigating the psychic emanations felt by Betsy), learning that the Shadow King controlled the base.

He told Psylocke that her mind is an open book to him, and releases Archangel from his psychic prison in Warren&#x27;s memory in revenge; Archangel cuts off the Shadow King&#x27;s &quot;head&quot;, erasing Betsy&#x27;s memory and enabling her to kill the man who was under the Shadow King&#x27;s influence. The Shadow King gave a reporter photographs of Warren killing the military, forcing the squad to apprehend their teammate and seek help from Dark Beast. As Farouk, the Shadow King appeared as a member of Daken&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (consisting of Sabretooth, Mystique, Skinless Man, the Blob from Earth-295, and the Omega Clan) in a plot to attack the X-Force.

He created an illusion of the Professor and Angel to catch Psylocke off-guard, expressing disappointment at the ease of defeating the warrior who caged him. Farouk was with the Brotherhood as they watched the apparent death of the X-Force. He, Creed and Daken showed Evan that his life was a computer-generated illusion and he was a clone of Apocalypse. The Brotherhood unsuccessfully planned to compel Evan to put on Apocalypse armor, make the Shadow King control him and destroy Jean Grey&#x27;s school. Psylocke locked the Shadow King in Omega White&#x27;s body and entrusted it to her brother, Captain Britain.

Apparently Brian or someone at his command had sealed the Shadow King&#x27;s host body in a tomb in the Gobi Desert where it was eventually found in stasis erroneously trapped inside Omega Black&#x27;s body by the Crimson Pirates and unwittingly released by their telepath, Bloody Bess. He possessed the Pirates except for Bess, who appealed to Nightcrawler for help. Nightcrawler and Bess fought the Pirates and the X-Men, who were controlled by the Shadow King. He was defeated when Bess and Psylocke threw off his mind control and sent Nightcrawler against him armed with Psylocke&#x27;s psi-blade, which stunned him long enough to be interred again in Omega Black&#x27;s body.

===Psi-War II===
The Shadow King has since been revealed to be imprisoned in the Astral Plane, but still trying to force his way out to the physical world. He began targeting psychics to build a web in order to escape the Astral Plane and the first one was Psylocke, who fell prey to him and would have released him if not for the intervention of Rogue, Old Man Logan, Warren, Bishop, Gambit and Fantomex. Knowing now that others psychics can fall prey too, Psylocke sends to the Astral Plane her teammates in order to defeat the Shadow King, unaware that he had changed, now half-human half-spider and is waiting for them. He also reveals that he has imprisoned in his realm the astral form of Professor Xavier.

As they arrive, they quickly fall into the Shadow King&#x27;s illusions and if they don&#x27;t break it their bodies and souls will fall under his control. Old Man Logan suddenly remembers everything and helps the other X-Men realize that the Shadow King is affecting their memories. As the room they are in transforms, they see three doors in front of them. Logan mentions that while the Shadow King is controlling things there are two minds involved in whatever they are in, which is how he figured out the play was fake. In the battle&#x27;s final moments, Shadow King spread a psychic infection on London before the X-Men ultimately defeated him with Fantomex donating his body to Professor X&#x27;s astral form while his mind remained in the Astral Plane. Professor Xavier now using the alias of X, controlled the psychic infection which was soon afterwards revealed to be actually Proteus which X unwittingly reconstituted back. X then convinced Psylocke to form a psychic network and draw its power to push back Proteus&#x27; influence, however the Shadow King had planted a portion of himself in Xavier&#x27;s mind and took advantage of this strategy and accessed the network to escape from the Astral Plane through X&#x27;s body. After the Shadow King defeated the X-Men, X managed to recover and worked together with Psylocke to create a deeper psychic network to defeated him once and for all. X erased the memories of all of the X-Men involved in his return save for Psylocke so she could watch over him in case the Shadow King wasn&#x27;t truly gone from his mind.

===Dawn of X===
During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Amahl Farouk is among the psychic mutants that are summoned to Genosha to help deal with a seed pod-type bomb that is vulnerable to psychic attacks, and it&#x27;s revealed that Amahl and the Shadow King are actually two different individuals. Having been born in Egypt Eyalet, to a merchant trader, during the sixteenth century, Amahl Farouk is a mutant whose psychic powers emerged at a young age. Amahl then used them to protect the market from thieves, until tragedy would eventually arrive to the market in the form of a plague. The young Amahl sat with his dying father and tried to use his telepathic powers to prevent the inevitable, suggesting that his telepathic powers likely allowed him to &quot;feel&quot; his father&#x27;s death as partly his own. With his father dead and the market gone, the young mutant had nothing to tether him to the city until he was approached by the Shadow King, who promised the boy a chance to never be alone again. From that moment on, Amahl was immersed in darkness as he joined with the Shadow King. Also while Amahl Farouk himself has already been seen on Krakoa, it wasn&#x27;t clear if the Shadow King was still a part of the mutant&#x27;s life, until a group of young mutants finishes their training and head for the caves on Krakoa, far from their instructors. There, Amahl Farouk, clearly still possessed by the Shadow King, awaits them to listening intently to the young X-Men and doubtlessly planning something sinister for the youngest mutants.

In time, the Shadow King sets his plans in motion and begins seducing several young mutants who are unsure of themselves, including Gabrielle Kinney and Rahne Sinclair. However, Gabrielle begins to suspect Farouk and is subsequently killed by Rahne, whom he had placed under his mind control. Gabrielle is resurrected, and confronted by the senior New Mutants, Farouk draws them and Gabrielle&#x27;s clique into the astral plane. The young mutants confront the Shadow King, encouraging Farouk to dissolve his connection with him, restoring his human mind and personality. Scarred by his connection with the Shadow King, Farouk leaves Krakoa, with the endorsement of the New Mutants, to undergo rehabilitation.

==Powers and abilities==
===The Shadow King===
Originally presented as a telepathic mutant second only to Professor X, the Shadow King is truly a multi-universal ethereal entity extending into each reality as a tendril of its larger self. It was spawned by the first nightmare, and preys on the bodies of powerful psychics. He uses captive psychics to enslave others, while feeding off their negative energy. He causes the captives to slowly merge with his own essence.

==Reception==
* In 2017, &quot;WhatCulture&quot; ranked Shadow King 8th in their &quot;10 Most Evil X-Men Villains&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, the Shadow King story is essentially unchanged. He assumes the guise of crime lord Amahl Farouk and encounters Charles Xavier; they wage a psychic battle on the astral plane which kills Farouk&#x27;s body, forcing his mind to move there. When Xavier died, the Shadow King became an agent of Apocalypse and appeared as a cloudy face in a bottle in his sanctum. Apocalypse used him to hunt down resisting mutants with powerful psionic powers, and train those that do agree to come aboard.

The Shadow King was the first to sense the presence of Nate Grey, forcing Apocalypse to send Domino and her Bounty Hunters to capture or kill him. When Angel&#x27;s assistant Karma was captured by Apocalypse&#x27;s servants, the Shadow King psychically tortured her into revealing the location of Magneto&#x27;s X-Men. He later attempted to read the mind of Bishop, but Bishop&#x27;s memory of the original reality (Earth-616) was enough to expel the Shadow King from his mind. Finally, the Shadow King followed Nightcrawler to the sanctuary of Avalon by hiding in the mind of Dead Man Wade. There he took control of the minds of the many of Avalon&#x27;s mutant and human refugees, causing great carnage. Nightcrawler, with the assistance of the psychic and Shadow King&#x27;s former student Damask, the time-stopping Switchback and Mystique, was able to physically teleport into the astral plane and defeat the Shadow King. The casualties caused by the Shadow King&#x27;s attack were enough to convince Destiny to accompany Nightcrawler and the X-Men on a mission to Apocalypse&#x27;s stronghold; Following his defeat on Avalon, the Shadow King was next seen reporting to Apocalypse about Domino&#x27;s failure to capture Nate Grey and inform Apocalypse about the destruction of the Southwest Kingdom by the Eurasian High Council&#x27;s radioactive bombs.

After Weapon X betrayed the X-Men and become the heir of Apocalypse, the Shadow King became his agent and chief telepath, though there are some hierarchy issues between him and Weapon X.

===Mutant X===
In an alternate universe, the Shadow King conquered the Hellfire Club. In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; dimension, he merged with Professor Xavier to form an evil being.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; series, Ultimate Amahl Farouk appeared as Storm&#x27;s lover and the leader of the group of thieves to which she and Lady Deathstrike belonged. After Storm discovered her powers, she sent him into a coma after accidentally electrocuting him. His mind went to another dimension, where he encountered the Brood and others and became the Shadow King. After returning in the present-day, he subtly manipulated Storm&#x27;s dreams, causing Ororo to write down her inflicted visions in an online play called &quot;The Shadow King&quot;. Soon, Farouk took direct action, dragging Ororo into the astral plane after a tiring battle and confronting her about her past. Once he revealed the circumstances of his transformation into the Shadow King, he attacked the X-Men with his Brood army; however, Storm&#x27;s willingness to let go of the past allowed her to once again attack Farouk, but intentionally, and his form disappeared from the plane, implying that he had died in the physical realm. His attack on the X-Men with the Brood was also revealed to be a ruse on Farouk&#x27;s part, to trick Ororo into killing him.

===Ultimate Universe===
An alternate universe variant of the Shadow King appears in the Ultimate Universe. This version is Shinobu Kageyama, a Japanese boy and member of a mutant cult.

===&quot;X-Men &#x27;92&quot;===
In Marvel&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the 1992 &quot;X-Men&quot; animated series was adapted into a limited series where this reality was made into the Battleworld domain of Westchester. In the series, Cassandra Nova runs a rehabilitation center for former villains, but is secretly possessed by the Shadow King. He planned on killing the Battlezone&#x27;s baron, Senator Kelly, but is stopped when X-Force rescues the X-Men.

<text>Assassin&#x27;s Quest is a 1997 fantasy novel by American writer Robin Hobb, the third and final book in &quot;The Farseer Trilogy&quot;. It follows the exploits of FitzChivalry Farseer. While Fitz&#x27;s narrative continues in The Tawny Man Trilogy, the Liveship Traders Trilogy is next in the chronology of the &quot;Realm of the Elderlings&quot;. 

==Plot summary==

FitzChivalry Farseer has been raised from death, but spends months with the mind of a wolf after his time sharing minds with Nighteyes. He lives in a remote cabin watched by Burrich and Chade, the only ones who know he is alive. Fitz gradually regains his humanity but struggles with the loss of his former life and the trauma of his torture in King Regal&#x27;s dungeons. Fitz decides only a personal quest to kill Regal will bring him peace. Before departing the cabin, Fitz is attacked by and kills Forged Ones. Through his uncontrollable Skill dreams, Fitz later learns that Burrich found the scene and believes him dead. Burrich is caring for Molly, Fitz&#x27;s former lover who is now pregnant with his child. Meanwhile, Lady Patience leads Buckkeep&#x27;s remaining resistance against the Red Ship Raiders.

Fitz travels to Regal&#x27;s palace in Tradeford but fails to assassinate him thanks to the remaining coterie members. Verity aids his escape and imprints the command &quot;Come To Me&quot; into Fitz&#x27;s mind. Unable to disobey, Fitz follows the path of Verity&#x27;s quest to find the Elderlings to the Mountain Kingdom. His bond with his Wit companion, Nighteyes, deepens and changes as they become more similar. The wolf begins to think abstractly and plan events as a human does. Fitz meets other Witted people who call themselves &quot;Old Blood,&quot; but declines to learn more of their ways.

Fitz and Nighteyes are joined by Starling, a minstrel, and Kettle, an old woman who is seeking the White Prophet. They evade Regal&#x27;s men to reach the Mountain Kingdom. Fitz is tended back to health by the White Prophet, revealed to be the Fool. The Fool has prophesied that Fitz is a Catalyst who is essential to the future of the Six Duchies. Verity and Kettricken&#x27;s child was stillborn. Kettricken and Chade decide to take Fitz and Molly&#x27;s daughter to become the Farseer heir, despite Fitz&#x27;s pleas that he be allowed a simple life with them.

As Regal attempts to conquer the Mountain Kingdom, Fitz, Kettricken, the Fool, and Starling set off to find Verity, followed by Kettle, who is mysteriously knowledgeable about the Skill. The group encounter a road leading to a ruined city, both constructed of a black stone imbued with Skill. The road is perilous for those sensitive to the Skill but without sufficient training. Fitz survives thanks to the guidance of Kettle and his bond with Nighteyes, and also develops a bond with the Fool. They discover a garden full of dragon sculptures that Fitz senses as alive with his Wit, which they realize may be the legendary Elderlings.

Beyond the garden is a quarry of Skill stone where they find Verity, frail and obsessed with carving a dragon of his own. Kettle reveals she is the last remaining member of a former royal coterie, though her Skill ability was taken from her. She reveals that the stone dragons were carved by Skilled Farseers and their coteries by Skilling their own memories and emotions into the stone, giving up their lives to animate the dragons. Fitz uses his Skill and Wit to help Verity and Kettle restore each other&#x27;s Skill strength. They nearly complete the dragon, but Verity does not have enough power left. After learning that Molly and Burrich have fallen in love while caring for her daughter, Fitz offers his own life on the condition that they be left alone. Instead, Verity and Fitz&#x27;s minds switch bodies, allowing Verity to share a last night with Kettricken and providing the final surge of emotion and memory needed. Verity becomes the dragon and flies with Kettricken and Starling to defend Buckkeep.

The Fool inadvertently wakes another incomplete dragon while Fitz faces Regal&#x27;s men. He learns how to wake the other dragons with a combination of blood and Wit. The risen dragons defeat the soldiers and Will, and are then led by Verity-as-Dragon to defeat the Red Ship Raiders. With his coterie broken, Regal has no defense against Fitz&#x27;s Skill. Instead of killing him, Fitz imprints him with fanatical loyalty to Kettricken and the Six Duchies. Regal restores Buckkeep and ensures the legitimacy of Kettricken and Verity&#x27;s heir she is left pregnant with, Prince Dutiful.

After the Raiders are defeated, the dragons return to the mountains to sleep as stone again. The Fool disappears, the prophecy of the Catalyst apparently fulfilled. Fitz retires into anonymity and travels for several years. Chade and Starling are some of the few who know he still lives in isolation, attempting to write about his history.

== Themes ==
&quot;Assassin’s Quest&quot; has been called a coming of age story. A starred review from Publishers Weekly stated that the story holds a lesson &quot;that the pursuit of truth demands a price in loneliness only a few can or will pay.&quot; Other reviewers have pointed to a sense of hopelessness in the narrative and how often Hobb makes use of failure.

==Reception==
&quot;Assassin’s Quest&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Reviewers have called the novel a fun and enjoyable read. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave the novel a starred review and commented on the &quot;shimmering language&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the novel &quot;an enthralling conclusion to this superb trilogy, displaying an exceptional combination of originality, magic, adventure, character, and drama.&quot;

==Editions==
* An American English paperback edition was issued in New York by Bantam Books in 1997 with .
* A British English hardback edition was issued in London by Voyager/HarperCollins in 1997 with . This edition&#x27;s cover is illustrated by John Howe.

<text>Joan II (; 28 January 1312 – 6 October 1349) was Queen of Navarre from 1328 until her death in 1349. 

Joan was the only surviving child of Louis I of Navarre and Margaret of Burgundy. Her father ascended the French throne as Louis X in 1314. Joan&#x27;s paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but Louis declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316. However, the French lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and elected Louis&#x27;s brother king as Philip V. The Navarrese noblemen also paid homage to Philip. Joan&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Agnes of France, and uncle, Odo IV of Burgundy, made attempts to secure the counties of Champagne and Brie (which had been the patrimony of Joan&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Joan I of Navarre) to Joan, but the French royal troops defeated her supporters. After Philip V married his daughter to Odo and granted him two counties as her dowry, Odo renounced Joan&#x27;s claim to Champagne and Brie in exchange for a compensation in March 1318. At this time, Joan married her cousin Philip of Évreux (later Philip III of Navarre).

In 1322, Philip V was succeeded by his brother Charles IV in both France and Navarre, but most Navarrese lords refused to swear loyalty to him. After Charles IV died in 1328, the Navarrese expelled the French governor and declared Joan the rightful monarch of Navarre. In France, Philip of Valois was crowned king as Philip VI. He concluded an agreement with Joan and her husband, who renounced Joan&#x27;s claims to Champagne and Brie in exchange for three counties, while Philip acknowledged their right to Navarre. Joan II and Philip III were crowned in Pamplona Cathedral in March 1329. The royal couple closely cooperated during their joint reign, but Philip III was more active. However, they mostly lived in their French domains, with Navarre being administered by governors during their absences. Philip died in 1343. Joan succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, and was succeeded by her son Charles II.

== Uncertain legitimacy ==

Joan was the daughter of King Louis I of Navarre and his wife, Margaret of Burgundy. Joan was born in 1312. Her father was the oldest son and heir of King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre.

Joan&#x27;s mother, Margaret, and the other daughters-in-law of King Philip, Joan and Blanche of Burgundy, were arrested in 1314. They were charged with adultery with two knights, the brothers Philip and Walter of Aunay. After being tortured, one of the brothers confessed that they had been the lovers of Margaret and Blanche for three years. The Aunay brothers were soon executed, and Margaret and Blanche were imprisoned. After the scandal, the legitimacy of Joan became dubious, because her mother was accused of having had an extramarital affair around the year of Joan&#x27;s birth.

Philip IV died on 26 November 1314, and Joan&#x27;s father became Louis X of France. Margaret technically became queen of France, but was not released and before long died in her prison in Château Gaillard.

Louis stated that Joan was his legitimate daughter on his deathbed. He died on 5 June 1316. His second wife, Clementia of Hungary, was pregnant. According to an agreement of the most powerful French lords, which was completed on 16 July, if Clementia gave birth to a son, the son was to be crowned King of France, but if a daughter was born, she and Joan could only inherit the Kingdom of Navarre and the counties of Champagne and Brie (the three realms that Louis X had inherited from his mother, Joan I of Navarre). It was also agreed that Joan was to be sent to her mother&#x27;s relatives in Burgundy, but her marriage could not be decided without the consent of the members of the French royal family.

== Orphanhood ==

Clementia gave birth to a son, John the Posthumous, on 13 November 1316, but he died five days later. Joan&#x27;s maternal uncle, Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy, who was in Paris, entered into negotiations with Philip IV&#x27;s second son, Philip the Tall, to protect Joan&#x27;s interests, but Philip did not respond to Odo&#x27;s demands. Instead, he made arrangements for his own coronation, which took place in Reims on 9 January 1317. The , an assembly of the French lords strengthened Philip&#x27;s position on 2 February, declaring that a woman could not inherit the French crown. The Navarrese noblemen sent a delegation to Paris to swear fidelity to Philip. Philip also refused to give Champagne and Brie to Joan.

Joan&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Agnes of France, Duchess of Burgundy, sent letters to the leading French lords, protesting against his coronation, but Philip V mounted the throne without real opposition. Letters were also written to the lords of Champagne in Joan&#x27;s name, urging them to refrain from paying homage to Philip and to protect Joan&#x27;s rights to Champagne. In another letter, Odo IV argued that the disinheritance of Joan by Philip V went against &quot;the divine right of law, by custom, in the usage kept in similar cases in empires, kingdoms, fiefs, in baronies in such a length of time that there is no memory of the contrary&quot;. However, Philip V&#x27;s uncle, Charles of Valois, defeated Joan&#x27;s supporters.

Philip and Odo concluded an agreement on 27 March 1318. Philip gave his eldest daughter (also named Joan) in marriage to Odo, recognizing them as heirs to the counties of Burgundy and Artois, while Joan was to marry her cousin Philip of Évreux, with a dowry of 15,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot; in rents and the right to inherit Champagne and Brie if Philip V died leaving no sons. The men also agreed that Joan was to renounce her claims to France and Navarre at the age of twelve. There is no evidence that the renunciation ever took place. The marriage of Joan and Philip was celebrated on 18 June 1318. Thereafter Joan lived with her husband&#x27;s grandmother, Marie of Brabant. Although they lived near each other, Philip and Joan were not raised together due to age difference. The marriage was only consummated in 1324.

== Extinction of the main Capet line ==

Philip V died without leaving a surviving son in early 1322. His brother, Charles the Fair, who was Philip IV&#x27;s last surviving son, succeeded him in both France and Navarre. Most Navarrese refused to do homage to Charles, and he did not confirm the &quot;Fueros&quot; (or liberties) of Navarre. Charles died on 1 February 1328, prompting another succession crisis. Since Charles&#x27;s widow, Joan of Évreux, was pregnant, the peers of France and other influential French lords assembled in Paris to elect a regent. The majority of the French lords concluded that Philip of Valois had the strongest claim to the office, because he was the closest patrilinear relative of the deceased king. The representatives of the Estates of the realm in Navarre, who assembled at Puente La Reina on 13 March, replaced the French governor with two local lords.

Charles&#x27;s widow gave birth to a daughter, Blanche, on 1 April. Her birth made it clear that the direct male line of the royal Capetian dynasty of France had become extinct with Charles the Fair&#x27;s death. Joan and her husband could claim the French throne, because they both were descended from French monarchs, but there were at least five other claimants, including Philip of Valois. The claimants&#x27; representatives met at Saint-Germain-en-Laye to reach a compromise. The general assembly of Navarre passed a resolution in May, requesting Joan to visit Navarre and to take control of its government, because the crown belonged &quot;by right of succession and inheritance&quot; to her.

Philip of Valois was crowned king of France in Reims on 29 May. He had no claim to Navarre, Champagne and Brie, because he was not descended from Joan I of Navarre. To strengthen his position in France, in July Philip acknowledged the right of Joan and her husband to rule Navarre. He also persuaded them to renounce Champagne and Brie in exchange for the counties of Longueville, Mortain and Angouleme, because he wanted to preserve the strategically important Champagne and Brie for the French crown.

== Accession and coronation ==

After the decision of the general assembly of Navarre in May 1328, Joan was regarded the lawful monarch of Navarre. This decision put an end to the personal union of Navarre and France, formed through the marriage of Joan I of Navarre and Philip IV of France. During the following months, Joan and her husband conducted lengthy negotiations with the Estates of the realm, especially about the role of Philip of Évreux in the administration of the kingdom. Although the Navarrese had only acknowledged Joan&#x27;s hereditary right to rule, her husband also claimed authority. During the couple&#x27;s absence, pogroms against the Jews occurred in the towns of Navarre.

Joan and Philip of Évreux sent two French lords, Henri IV de Sully and , to Navarre to represent them during the negotiations. The Navarrese were initially reluctant to confirm Philip&#x27;s right to share the queen&#x27;s rule. The delegates of the general assembly first declared that Philip would be allowed to take part in the administration of Navarre in a meeting in Roncesvalles in November 1328. However, they also stated that all traditional elements of the coronation (including the new monarch&#x27;s elevation on a shield and the throwing of money to spectators) would only be carried out in connection with Joan. To emphasize Philip&#x27;s claim to reign in his wife&#x27;s realm, Henry de Sully referred to Paul the Apostle who had stated that &quot;the head of woman is man&quot; in his First Epistle to the Corinthians. Sully also emphasized that Joan had approved and consented to strengthen her husband&#x27;s position.

Joan and Philip came to Navarre in early 1329. They were crowned in the Pamplona Cathedral on 5 March. Both were raised on a shield and both threw money during the ceremony. They signed a coronation oath, establishing their royal prerogatives. The charter underlined that Joan was the &quot;true and natural heir&quot; of Navarre, but also declared that &quot;all of the kingdom of Navarre would obey her consort&quot;. However, the Navarrese also specified that both Joan and Philip were to renounce the crown as soon as their heir reached twenty-one, or they were obliged to pay a fine of 100,000 &quot;livres&quot;. Joan also compensated her husband for his expenses connected to the acquisition of Navarre.

== Reign ==

Joan II and Philip III of Navarre closely cooperated during their joint reign. Out of the eighty-five royal decrees preserved from the period of their joint rule, forty-one documents were issued in both names. However, the sources suggest that Philip was more active in several fields of government, especially legislation. He signed thirty-eight decrees alone, without referring to his wife. Only six documents were issued exclusively in Joan&#x27;s name.

After the coronation, the royal couple ordered the punishment of the perpetrators of the anti-Jewish riots and the paying of compensation to the victims. The royal fortresses were repaired and a new castle was built at Castelrenault during their reign. Irrigation system of the arid fields around Tudela was also constructed with the royal couple&#x27;s financial support. They also wanted to maintain peaceful relationship with the neighboring states. They opened negotiations about the betrothal of their firstborn daughter, Joan, to Peter, the heir of Aragon, already in 1329. A peace treaty with Castille was signed at Salamance on 15 March 1330.

Joan and Philip left Navarre in September 1331. Historian Elena Woodacre notes, the &quot;royal couple had to balance the needs of their French territories alongside the rule of Navarre&quot;, which forced them to split their time between all of their domains. Joan and Philip could hardly get accustomed to the &quot;tastes and customs of the Navarrese, and were alien to their language&quot;, according to historian José María Lacarra, for which they were often absent from the kingdom. During the monarchs&#x27; absence, French governors administered Navarre on their behalf.

A border dispute over the ownership of the Monastery of Fitero developed into a war with Castille in 1335. Peter IV of Aragon supported the Navarrese and a new peace treaty with Castille was signed on 28 February 1336. Joan and Philip returned to Navarre in April 1336. Their second visit lasted till October 1337. Philip twice returned to the realm, but Joan did not accompany him.

Philip III died in September 1343. She soon replaced Philip of Melun, who had administered Navarre in the royal couple&#x27;s name, with William of Brahe. Before long, she also dismissed William of Brahe, replacing him with Jean de Conflans. These changes may have reflected a disagreement with Philip over administration of Navarre, according to historian Elena Woodacre. In 1344, a copy of the &quot;Fueros of Navarre&quot; was arranged for the queen in the local Romance language (&quot;in ydiomate Navarre&quot;), providing a spare column for its translation to the &quot;ydioma galicanum&quot; (a French variant) eventually left a blank. French was probably the natural language used by Joan, even to deal with matters related with Navarre. Joan established the convent of San Francisco in Olite in 1345.

Joan decided to again visit Navarre, but she never returned, most probably because of the possibility of an invasion of her family&#x27;s domains in France during the Hundred Years War. She and her husband had supported Philip VI against Edward III of England, who claimed the French throne as the son of Joan&#x27;s aunt Isabella. By 1346, however, Joan was disappointed by Philip VI&#x27;s failures as military leader. In November she boldly concluded a truce with the Earl of Lancaster, granting Edward&#x27;s troops free passage through her county of Angoulême in return for protection of her lands. She also promised not to build new fortification or allow Philip&#x27;s army to use the existing ones. Philip was unable to take action against her.

Joan died of Black Death on 6 October 1349. In her last will, she requested that her son finance a chapel in Santa Maria of Olite. She was buried in the Basilica of St Denis, though her heart was buried at the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris alongside that of her husband&#x27;s.

== Family ==
Joan&#x27;s husband, Philip of Évreux, was a grandson of Philip III of France. They were efficient as co-rulers but no evidence attests to the closeness of their personal relationship, in contrast to the well-documented marriages of Joan&#x27;s grandparents, father and uncles. This indicates that their marriage was marked neither by particular affection nor difficulty. They were very rarely apart, however, and had nine children together.

<doc id="840209" wikidata="Q4821484" url="?curid=840209" title="Augustus Lowell">
<text>Augustus Lowell (January 15, 1830 – June 22, 1900) was a wealthy Massachusetts industrialist, philanthropist, horticulturist, and civic leader. A member of the Brahmin Lowell family, he was born in Boston to John Amory Lowell and his second wife Elizabeth Cabot Putnam. His great-grandfather, John Lowell, was among the first Judges for the newly created federal courts, appointed by Presidents George Washington and John Adams. Augustus&#x27; elder brother, Judge John Lowell, would be appointed to hold the same seats held by their great-grandfather, by Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Rutherford Hayes.

==Family==

Lowell was amongst the fifth generation in his family to graduate from Harvard College, class of 1850. On June 1, 1854, he married Katherine Bigelow Lawrence (February 21, 1832 - April 1, 1895), the daughter of Hon. Abbott Lawrence. Both Augustus and Katherine were able to trace their ancestry back through the earliest colonial settlers and founders of New England, in the mid-17th century, and even further back to notable English families of the 12th and 13th centuries.

Augustus and Katherine Lowell had seven children and thus named their , Brookline, Massachusetts, estate, &quot;Sevenels&quot;. The Lowells lost two of their children during infancy but their surviving children went on to great public prominence. Eldest son Percival Lowell wrote several books on the Far East and on the planet Mars, and founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Their second son, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, succeeded Augustus as Trustee at the Lowell Institute in 1900, and became President of Harvard College in 1909, serving in that capacity until 1933. One of their daughters, Katharine Lowell, married (1) James Alfred Roosevelt, of the Long Island clan, and (2) T. James Bowlker, a Boston cotton mill owner. Another daughter, Elizabeth Lowell Putnam, was a prominent activist for prenatal care. And their youngest daughter, Amy Lowell, 20 years younger than her brothers, would become the second celebrated poet in the Lowell family.

== Career ==

Augustus was Treasurer of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company, a textile mill in Lowell, Massachusetts, for much of his early career. In 1875, he became Treasurer of the Boott Cotton Mills, also in Lowell. And in 1883, he was Director of The Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton and Woolen Manufacturing Company. All were positions his father, John Amory, had once held within the same companies. He was also, as of 1878, a director of the Pacific Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the largest textile combine of its time.

Lowell was also a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Vice President of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1881, Augustus was appointed as the sole Trustee of the Lowell Institute, upon his father&#x27;s death (Lowell 1899, pp 118–119), a position he would hold for the last 20 years of his life.

<doc id="840212" wikidata="Q314548" url="?curid=840212" title="Gerard van Honthorst">
<text>Gerard van Honthorst (Dutch: &quot;Gerrit van Honthorst&quot;; 4 November 1592 – 27 April 1656) was a Dutch Golden Age painter who became known for his depiction of artificially lit scenes, eventually receiving the nickname &quot;Gherardo delle Notti&quot; (&quot;Gerard of the Nights&quot;). Early in his career he visited Rome, where he had great success painting in a style influenced by Caravaggio. Following his return to the Netherlands he became a leading portrait painter. Van Honthorst&#x27;s contemporaries included Utrecht painters Hendrick Ter Brugghen and Dirck van Baburen.

==Early life==
 
Van Honthorst was born in Utrecht, the son of a decorative painter, and trained under his father, and then under Abraham Bloemaert.

==Italy==
Having completed his education, Honthorst went to Italy, where he is first recorded in 1616. He was one of the artists from Utrecht who went to Rome at around this time, all of whom were to be deeply influenced by the recent art they encountered there. They were named the Utrecht &quot;caravaggisti&quot;. The other three were Dirk van Baburen, Hendrick ter Bruggen and Jan van Bijlert. In Rome he lodged at the palace of Vincenzo Giustiniani, where he painted &quot;Christ Before the High Priest&quot;, now in London&#x27;s National Gallery. Giustiniani had an important art collection, and Honthorst was especially influenced by the contemporary artists, including Caravaggio, Bartolomeo Manfredi and the Carracci. He was particularly known for his depiction of artificially lit scenes. Cardinal Scipione Borghese became another important patron, securing important commissions for him at &quot;San Silvestro Della Mariro&quot;, Montecompatri, and at &quot;Santa Maria della Vittoria&quot; in Rome. He also worked for Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

==Return to Utrecht==
Honthorst returned to Utrecht in 1620, and went on to build a considerable reputation both in the Dutch Republic and abroad. In 1623, the year of his marriage, he was president of the Guild of St. Luke in Utrecht. He soon became so fashionable that Sir Dudley Carleton, then English envoy at The Hague, recommended his works to the Earl of Arundel and Lord Dorchester. In 1626 Honthorst hosted a dinner for Rubens, and painted him as the honest man sought for and found by Diogenes.

==Royal patronage==
Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, sister of Charles I of England and Electress Palatine, then in exile in the Netherlands, commissioned Honthorst as a painter and employed him as a drawing-master for her children. Through her he became known to Charles, who invited him to England in 1628. There he painted several portraits, and a vast allegory, now at Hampton Court, of Charles and his queen as Diana and Apollo in the clouds receiving the Duke of Buckingham as Mercury and guardian of the King of Bohemia&#x27;s children. He painted a more intimate group portrait of &quot;The Four Eldest Children of the King of Bohemia&quot;, (also at Hampton Court) in which the two eldest are depicted as Diana and Apollo.

After his return to Utrecht, Honthorst retained the patronage of the English monarch, painting for him, in 1631, a large picture of the king and queen of Bohemia and all their children. At around the same time he painted some pictures illustrating the Odyssey for Lord Dorchester, and some showing incidents of Danish history for Christian IV of Denmark. He also painted a portrait of the king&#x27;s daughter Countess Leonora while she was in the Hague.

His popularity in the Netherlands was such that he opened a second studio in the Hague, where he painted portraits of members of the court, and taught drawing. These large studios, where the work included making replicas of Honthorst&#x27;s royal portraits, employed a large number of pupils and assistants; according to one pupil, Joachim von Sandrart, describing his experiences in the mid-1620s, Honthorst would have about 24 students at any one time, each paying 100 guilders a year for their education.

His brother Willem van Honthorst (1594–1666) was also a portrait painter. Many of Willem&#x27;s paintings were previously misattributed to Gerrit due to the similarity of their signatures. Willem was a pupil of Abraham Bloemaert, and was also taught by his own elder brother. In 1646 he went to Berlin, where he became court painter to Louise-Henriette, wife of the elector Frederick II of Brandenburg. He returned to Utrecht in 1664.

==Nickname==
Honthorst is often referred to as &quot;Gherardo delle notti&quot; (&quot;Gerrit of the Nights&quot;) by modern Italians. However, the nickname does not actually appear in any known Italian sources dating before Honthorst&#x27;s death. Surviving Italian documents from before 1656 refer to the artist as either &quot;Gherardo Fiammingo&quot; (&quot;Gerrit the Fleming&quot;) or &quot;Gherardo Hollandese&quot; (&quot;Gerrit the Dutchman&quot;), emphasizing his foreignness rather than his trademark skill at rendering nocturnal lighting. It was only in the 18th century that the nickname &quot;Gherardo delle notti&quot; came into widespread use.

==Legacy==
Honthorst was a prolific artist. His most attractive pieces are those in which he cultivates the style of Caravaggio, often tavern scenes with musicians, gamblers and people eating. He had great skill at &quot;chiaroscuro&quot;, often painting scenes illuminated by a single candle.

Some of his pieces were portraits of the Duke of Buckingham and his family (Hampton Court), the King and Queen of Bohemia (Hanover and Combe Abbey), Marie de Medici (Amsterdam Stadthuis), 1628, the &quot;Stadtholders and their Wives&quot; (Amsterdam and The Hague), Charles Louis and Rupert, Charles I&#x27;s nephews (Musée du Louvre, St Petersburg, Combe Abbey and Willin), and Baron Craven (National Portrait Gallery, London). His early style can be seen in the &quot;Lute-player&quot; (1614) in the Louvre, the &quot;Martyrdom of St John&quot; in Santa Maria della Scala at Rome, or the &quot;Liberation of Peter&quot; in the Berlin Museum.

His 1620 &quot;The Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; in the Uffizi was destroyed in the Via dei Georgofili Massacre of 1993.

Honthorst&#x27;s 1623 &quot;The Concert&quot; was purchased for an undisclosed sum by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from a private collection in France in November 2013. The painting had not been on view since 1795. The &quot;The Concert&quot; went on display for the first time in 218 years in a special installation at the National Gallery of Art&#x27;s West Building on 23 November 2013. It remained there for six months before going on permanent display in the museum&#x27;s Dutch and Flemish galleries.

<doc id="840213" wikidata="Q2636748" url="?curid=840213" title="Alan Simpson (American politician)">
<text>Alan Kooi Simpson (born September 2, 1931) is an American politician from Wyoming. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the United States Senate from 1979 to 1997. Simpson was the Republican whip in the U.S. Senate from 1985 to 1995, as majority whip from 1985 to 1987 and minority whip from 1987 to 1995. He also served as co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Democratic Party co-chair Erskine Bowles of North Carolina.

Born in Denver, Simpson graduated from the University of Wyoming&#x27;s law school (1958). Simpson served in the Wyoming House of Representatives (1965–1977) and won election to the United States Senate (1978). His father, Milward Simpson, had served in the same seat (1962–1967). Simpson served as the Senate Republican Whip (1985–1995). After serving three terms in the Senate, Simpson declined to seek re-election in 1996.

Since leaving office, Simpson has practiced law and taught at different universities. He also served on the Continuity of Government Commission, the American Battle Monuments Commission, and the Iraq Study Group. In 2010, President Barack Obama appointed him to co-chair the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which made several recommendations on ways to reduce the national debt. He has been a vocal proponent of amending the U.S. Constitution to overturn &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; (2010) and allow Congress to set reasonable limits on campaign spending in U.S. elections.

==Early life==
Simpson was born in Denver, the son of Milward Simpson and the former Lorna Kooi. His middle name, Kooi, comes from his maternal grandfather, whose parents were Dutch immigrants. In his youth, Simpson was a Boy Scout, and once visited Japanese American Boy Scouts who, along with their families, had been interned near Ralston, Wyoming, during World War II. There, he developed a friendship with Norman Mineta, who later became a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from California, and the United States Secretary of Transportation in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush. Mineta and Simpson served together in Congress, and on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and remained close friends.

Simpson has an older brother, Pete Simpson of Cody, a historian and a former administrator at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, who served in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1981 to 1984, having represented Sheridan County, while he was then an administrator at Sheridan College. Pete Simpson was the 1986 Republican gubernatorial nominee, having sought the office while his younger brother was serving in the U.S. Senate.

Simpson grew to 6&#x27;7&quot; (201 cm) and would become the tallest Senator in United States history until being overtaken by 6&#x27;9&quot; (206 cm) Luther Strange in 2017, 20 years after his retirement. He would later claim to have shrunk to 6&#x27;5&quot; (195.5 cm) at 85.

Alan Simpson graduated from Cody High School in Cody, Wyoming in 1949 and attended Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in 1950 for a postgraduate year. He graduated in 1954 from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor of Science degree, and in 1958 with a Juris Doctor degree. Like his brother, he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at the University of Wyoming.

In 1954, he married the former Susan Ann Schroll, who was a fellow UW student from Greybull, Wyoming. He served in the United States Army in Germany from 1955 to 1956, with the 10 Infantry Regiment of the now-inactive Fifth Infantry Division, and with the 12 Armored Infantry Battalion of the now-inactive 2nd Armored Division.

Simpson had several run-ins with the law during his youth. An amicus brief filed before the United States Supreme Court in the juvenile imprisonment cases &quot;Graham v. Florida&quot; and &quot;Sullivan v. Florida&quot;, states:
 
Simpson stated &quot;I was just dumb and rebellious and stupid. And a different person,&quot; adding &quot;You&#x27;re not who you are when you&#x27;re 16 or 18. You&#x27;re dumb and you don&#x27;t care, and you think you are eternal.&quot;

==Wyoming House of Representatives==
Simpson served from 1965 to 1977 in the Wyoming House of Representatives from Park County.

==U.S. Senate==

Simpson was elected to the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, but was appointed to the post early on January 1, 1979, following the resignation of Clifford Hansen, who had succeeded Milward Simpson, Alan Simpson&#x27;s own father, in the seat. From 1985 to 1995, Simpson was the Republican whip, Assistant Republican Leader in the Senate, having served with then-Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. He was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs from 1981 to 1985 and again from 1995 to 1997 when Republicans regained control of the Senate. He also chaired the Immigration and Refugee Subcommittee of Judiciary; the Nuclear Regulation Subcommittee; the Social Security Subcommittee and the Committee on Aging.

Simpson was a moderate conservative. He supported abortion rights and voted against a ban of late-term abortions which did not include an exception for physical health, only for life-threatening conditions, in 1995 and 1996. However he opposed federal funding for abortions and supported the Hyde Amendment. He was also the co-sponsor of a bill regulating immigration. As a ranking minority member of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, he drew criticism for calling Hmong refugees &quot;the most indigestible group in society,&quot; which Hmong American scholar Kou Yang said was at the time the &quot;worst of all&quot; comments on Hmong.

Simpson voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and initially voted in favor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (but voted to sustain Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto). Simpson voted in favor of the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination and Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.

==After Congress==
In 1995, he lost the whip&#x27;s job to Trent Lott of Mississippi, and he did not seek reelection to the Senate in 1996. From 1997 to 2000, Simpson taught at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard University&#x27;s Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and he served for two years as the Director of the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School.

Simpson then returned to his hometown of Cody and practices law there with his two lawyer sons (William and Colin) in the firm of Simpson, Kepler and Edwards. The three are also partners in the firm of Burg Simpson Eldredge Hersh &amp; Jardine of Englewood, Colorado. Colin M. Simpson, the third generation of his family in Wyoming politics, was a Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives who served as Speaker of the House for the 59th session of the Legislature, 2008 to March 2010. He was a candidate for governor in the primary in 2010, finishing fourth.

Simpson teaches periodically at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Wyoming at Laramie, with his brother Pete. He has completed serving as chairman of the UW capital &quot;Campaign for Distinction,&quot; which raised $204 million. That success was celebrated by the gala event, &quot;An Extraordinary Evening&quot;, featuring former President George H. W. Bush (who had reportedly considered Simpson for the vice presidency in 1988) and Vice President Dick Cheney, another UW alumnus, and his wife Lynne Cheney.

In 2001, Simpson became Honorary Chairman of the Republican Unity Coalition (RUC), a gay/straight alliance within the Republican Party. In that capacity, Simpson recruited former President Gerald Ford to serve on the RUC advisory board.

In 2002, Simpson was involved in the Wyoming Republican gubernatorial primary on behalf of former Democrat Eli Bebout of Riverton.

Simpson was one of four speakers chosen to eulogize President George H.W. Bush at his state funeral.

===Iraq Study Group===
In 2006, Simpson was one of ten (five Democratic and five Republican) contributors to the Iraq Study Group Report.

===National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform===
Simpson was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Obama&#x27;s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Erskine Bowles.

Simpson has spoken extensively about the burden being placed on future generations by the structure of current entitlement programs. In an opinion piece, &quot;Young Americans get the shaft&quot; published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on June 13, 2012, Matt Miller recounted asking Simpson (then a US senator) in 1995 how to fix this problem. Miller stated that Simpson told him &quot;nothing would change until someone like me could walk into his office and say, &#x27;I&#x27;m from the American Association of Young People. We have 30 million members, and we&#x27;re watching you, Simpson. You [mess with] us and we&#x27;ll take you out.&#x27;&quot;

He has continued to advocate for fiscal responsibility as a board member of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a founder of the Campaign to Fix the Debt.

===Campaign finance reform===
Simpson has been a strong critic of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, calling for an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to overturn the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in the case. In an interview with Wyoming Public Radio, Simpson said: &quot;I think most Americans would like to see reasonable limits on campaign spending.&quot;

===Issue advocacy===
Simpson has been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights, stating that the matter should not be a political issue in a party that believes in &quot;government out of our lives&quot; and &quot;the right to be left alone&quot; and &quot;the precious right of privacy&quot;. He supports LGBT rights, and equality regardless of race and society, color, creed, gender, or sexual orientation. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Simpson criticized the since-ended &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy, stating &quot;&#x27;Gay&#x27; is an artificial category that says little about a person. Our differences and prejudices pale next to our historic challenge.&quot;

===Civic participation===
Simpson is on the board of directors at the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD). The institute was created at the University of Arizona after the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. He is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope and co-chair of the advisory board of Issue One, a nonprofit organization that seeks to reduce the role of money in politics. In 2016, he joined the advisory board of American Promise, a national, cross-partisan organization that advocates for a 28th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that would allow the U.S. Congress and states to set limits on campaign finance in U.S. elections.

===Presidential Medal of Freedom ===

On July 1, 2022, the White House announced that Simpson would be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==In popular culture==
The June 7, 1994, edition of the now-defunct supermarket tabloid &quot;Weekly World News&quot; reported that 12 U.S. senators were aliens from other planets, including Simpson. The Associated Press ran a follow-up piece which confirmed the tongue-in-cheek participation of Senate offices in the story. Then-Senator Simpson&#x27;s spokesman Charles Pelkey, when asked about Simpson&#x27;s galactic origins, told the AP: &quot;We&#x27;ve got only one thing to say: Klaatu barada nikto&quot;. This was a quotation from a classic science fiction film, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), in which an alien arrives by flying saucer in Washington, D.C.

Simpson also played himself in a cameo appearance for the 1993 film &quot;Dave&quot;.

In December 2012, Simpson filmed a &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; video for a campaign, with a man in a tin can costume. The video, aimed at young people, is called &quot;The Can Kicks Back,&quot; a reference to the tendencies of members of Congress to forever &quot;kick the can down the road&quot; in order to avoid making difficult decisions about lowering the national debt. In the video, Simpson admonishes younger Americans to make better use of their social media than &quot;instagramming your breakfast and tweeting your first world problems.&quot; He advises younger people to use their social media skills and resources to rally their friends to join The Can Kicks Back. If younger Americans do not take heed, Simpson says, &quot;These old coots will clean out the Treasury before you get there.&quot;

==Works==
* &quot;Right in the Old Gazoo: A Lifetime of Scrapping with the Press&quot;. (William Morrow &amp; Company, 1997). )

==Recognition==
In 1998, Simpson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2011, Simpson and Erskine Bowles were presented the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government for their work on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. In 2022 Simpson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a ceremony at the White House.

<text>John Kirk Townsend (August 10, 1809 – February 6, 1851) was an American naturalist, ornithologist and collector.

Townsend was a Quaker born in Philadelphia, the son of Charles Townsend and Priscilla Kirk. He attended Westtown School in West Chester, Pennsylvania and was trained as a physician and pharmacist. He developed an interest in natural history in general and bird collecting in particular. In 1833, he was invited by the botanist Thomas Nuttall to join him on Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth&#x27;s second expedition across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Townsend collected a number of animals new to science. These included birds such as the mountain plover, Vaux&#x27;s swift, chestnut-collared longspur, black-throated grey warbler, Townsend&#x27;s warbler and sage thrasher, and a number of mammals such as the Douglas squirrel; several of these were described by Bachman (1839) from samples collected by Townsend. Townsend collected skulls of indigenous people, procured by stealing them from graves. 

==Family==
John Kirk Townsend was the son of Charles Townsend and Priscilla Kirk, he had five brothers and four sisters. His sister Mary, a naturalist with an interest in entomology, wrote a popular book called &quot;Life In the Insect World&quot; in 1844. Mary and another sister, Hannah, wrote &quot;The Anti-Slavery Alphabet&quot; in 1846, which was sold at the Anti-Slavery Fair in Philadelphia. His brother Edward was President of the Philadelphia Institution for Instruction of the Blind and helped organize the Philadelphia Dental College.

==Oregon==
While at Wyeth&#x27;s Fort William in Oregon, Townsend served as the appointed magistrate to the first public trial by Europeans in Oregon.
This occurred when the post&#x27;s gunsmith, Thomas J. Hubbard, attacked and killed the fort&#x27;s tailor in an argument over a young native girl. The gunsmith was acquitted by a jury when they ruled the death was justifiable homicide.

==Work==
Townsend collected numerous animal specimens during his travels. He sent many of these back to John James Audubon for further assessment and characterization. Audubon gave Townsend broad authority in naming specimens that he collected.

On his return, Townsend wrote &quot;The Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River and a Visit to the Sandwich Islands&quot; (1839). This is a narrative of a journey by Wyeth&#x27;s expedition over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean between 1834 and 1835.

A number of mammals are named for Townsend. Many of these were described from specimens collected during his travels. Townsend&#x27;s ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus townsendii&quot;) is endemic to the southwestern region of the state of Washington. Townsend&#x27;s chipmunk (&quot;Tamias townsendii&quot;), Townsend&#x27;s mole (&quot;Scapanus townsendii&quot;), and Townsend&#x27;s vole (&quot;Microtus townsendii&quot;) occur in the northwest of the United States and southwest of British Columbia. Townsend&#x27;s pocket gopher (&quot;Thomomys townsendii&quot;) is found in southern Oregon, northern California, northern Nevada, and through the Snake River Valley in Idaho. Townsend&#x27;s big-eared bat (&quot;Corynorhinus townsendii&quot;) is found from southern British Columbia south through the western United States to southern Mexico. The whitetail jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus townsendii&quot;) ranges through southern Canada and the western, central US through eastern California and Colorado. The Townsend&#x27;s warbler and Townsend&#x27;s solitaire are also named after Mr. Townsend.

Townsend died of arsenic poisoning. He had developed a formula used in taxidermy preparations and arsenic was the &quot;secret&quot; ingredient.

<text>Joachim von Sandrart (12 May 1606 – 14 October 1688) was a German Baroque art-historian and painter, active in Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age. He is most significant for his collection of biographies of Dutch and German artists the &quot;Teutsche Academie&quot;, published between 1675 and 1680.

==Biography==
Sandrart was born in Frankfurt am Main, but the family originated from Mons. According to his dictionary of art called the &quot;Teutsche Academie&quot;, he learned to read and write from the son of Theodor de Bry, Johann Theodoor de Brie and his associate Matthäus Merian, but at age 15 was so eager to learn more of the art of engraving, that he walked from Frankfurt to Prague to become a pupil of Aegidius Sadeler of the Sadeler family. Sadeler in turn urged him to paint, whereupon he travelled to Utrecht in 1625 to become a pupil of Gerrit van Honthorst, and through him he met Rubens when he brought a visit to Honthorst in 1627, to recruit him for collaboration on part of his Marie de&#x27; Medici cycle. Honthorst took Sandrart along with him when he travelled to London. There he worked with Honthorst and spent time making copies of Holbein portraits for the portrait gallery of Henry Howard, 22nd Earl of Arundel.

Making all of those copies only served to arouse more curiosity in the young adventurer, and in 1627 Sandrart booked a passage on a ship from London to Venice, where he was welcomed by Jan Lis (whose Bentvueghels &quot;bent&quot; name was &quot;Pan&quot;), and Nicolas Régnier. He then set out for Bologna, where he was met by his uncle on his mother&#x27;s side Michael le Blond, a celebrated engraver. With him, he crossed the mountains to Florence, and from there on to Rome, where they met Pieter van Laer (whose bent name was &quot;Bamboccio&quot;). After a few years he undertook a tour of Italy, traveling to Naples, where he drew studies of Mount Vesuvius, believed to be the entrance to the Elysian fields described by Virgil. From there he traveled to Malta and beyond, searching for literary sights to see and paint, and wherever he went he paid his way by selling portraits. Only when he was done traveling did he finally return to Frankfurt, where he married Johanna de Milkau in 1637.

Afraid of political unrest and plague, he moved to Amsterdam with his wife in 1637.

==Painting career==
In Amsterdam he worked as a painter of genre works, and portraits. He won a very good following as a painter, winning a lucrative commission for a large commemorative piece for the state visit by Maria of Medici in 1638, which hangs in the Rijksmuseum. This piece was commissioned by the Bicker Company of the Amsterdam &quot;schutterij&quot;, and shows the members posing around a bust of Maria of Medici, with a poem by Joost van den Vondel hanging below it. The state visit was a big deal for Amsterdam, as it meant the first formal recognition of the Dutch Republic of the seven provinces by France. However, Maria herself was fleeing Richelieu at the time and never returned to France. This piece cemented his reputation as a leading painter, and in 1645 Sandrart decided to cash in and go home when he received an inheritance in Stockau, outside Ingolstadt, he sold his things and moved there. He received 3000 guilders for 2 books of his Italian drawings, that according to Houbraken 
were resold in his lifetime for 4555 guilders.

Though he rebuilt the old homestead, it was burned by the French. He sold it and moved to Augsburg, where he painted for the family of Maximilian I, the Elector of Bavaria. When his wife died in 1672, Sandrart moved to Nuremberg, where he married Hester Barbara Bloemaart, the daughter of a magistrate there. This is where he started writing.

His large 1649 painting &quot;Peace-Banquet&quot; commemorating the Peace of Münster, now hangs in Nuremberg&#x27;s town hall. 
==Teutsche Academie==

He is best known as an author of books on art, some of them in Latin, and especially for his historical work, the &quot;Teutsche Academie der edlen Bau-, Bild- und Mahlerey-Künste&quot;, published between 1675 and 1680, and in more recent editions. This work is an educational compilation of short biographies of artists, as &quot;a printed supplement to or surrogate for an academic course,&quot; inspired by Karel van Mander&#x27;s similar &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;. Both Sandrart and van Mander based their Italian sections on the work of Giorgio Vasari. His work in turn became one of the primary sources for Arnold Houbraken&#x27;s &quot;Schouburg&quot;, who wrote a little poem about him:

Sandrart copied a mistake in Cornelis de Bie&#x27;s &quot;Het Gulden Cabinet&quot; on Hendrick ter Brugghen whom De Bie has erroneously called &quot;Verbrugghen&quot;. De Bie corrects this mistake in a manuscript and attacks Sandrart for having copied the mistake without proper research in a later work of his.

<text>In Greek mythology, Astypalaea (Ancient Greek: Ἀστυπάλαια ) or Astypale was a Phoenician princess as the daughter of King Phoenix and Perimede, daughter of Oeneus; thus she was the sister of Europa. In some accounts, her mother was called Telephe and her siblings were Peirus and again Europe. Astypale was a lover of Poseidon who seduced her, and had two sons by him: Ancaeus, King of Samos, and Eurypylos, King of Kos.

The island of Astypalaia was believed to have been named after her.

<text>AASI or Advanced Aerodynamics and Structures Inc (originally ASI, Aerodynamics and Structures Inc.) was an aircraft maker, headquartered in Long Beach, California. The company was financed by US based Business Tycoon Late Hameed Hamza and co-owned by Darius Sharifzade and Huzefa H. to develop and manufacture a line of business aircraft of unconventional configuration, the Jetcruzer. 

But the Jetcruzer program was later hampered by a lengthy development and although the prototype version (the 450) had flown as early as 1989, by 2002 AASI still did not have Jetcruzer in production. That year AASI acquired the assets of the Mooney Aircraft Company and changed its name to the Mooney Aerospace Group (MASG).

Shortly thereafter, MASG suspended development of the Jetcruzer to focus on Mooney&#x27;s line of light aircraft. The Jetcruzer assets were put up for auction in November 2003 and sold to Innova Aircraft.

This was not enough to save the company and in 2004, MASG sold off the Mooney assets to Allen Holding Finance.

<text>The Russell Senate Office Building is the oldest of the United States Senate office buildings. Designed in the Beaux-Arts architectural style, it was built from 1903 to 1908 and opened in 1909. It was named for former Senator Richard Russell Jr. from Georgia in 1972. It occupies a site north of the Capitol bounded by Constitution Avenue, First Street, Delaware Avenue, and C Street N.E.

==History==
The first congressional office building was constructed immediately after the turn of the 20th century to relieve overcrowding in the United States Capitol. Previously, members who wanted office space had to rent quarters or borrow space in committee rooms. In March 1901 Congress authorized Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark to draw plans for fireproof office buildings adjacent to the Capitol grounds. In March 1903 the acquisition of sites and construction of the buildings were authorized, and the Senate Office Building Commission selected a site.

In April 1904, the prominent New York City architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings was retained. John Carrère took charge of the Senate Office Building project, while Thomas Hastings oversaw the construction of an almost identical office building (now named the Cannon House Office Building) for the United States House of Representatives. Their Beaux Arts designs were restrained complements to the Capitol. Architecturally, their elevations are divided into a rusticated base and a colonnade with an entablature and balustrade. The Constitution Ave. side is a quasi replica of the easternmost façade of the Palais du Louvre in Paris. The colonnades, with 34 Doric columns that face the Capitol, are echoed by pilasters on the sides of the buildings. Both buildings are faced with marble and limestone; the Russell Building&#x27;s base and terrace are gray granite. Modern for their time, they included such facilities as forced-air ventilation systems, steam heat, individual lavatories with hot and cold running water and ice water, telephones, and electricity. Both are connected to the Capitol by underground passages. Originally there were 98 suites and eight committee rooms in the Russell Building; the First Street Wing, completed in 1933, added two committee rooms and 28 suites.

Of special architectural interest is the rotunda. Eighteen Corinthian columns support an entablature and a coffered dome, whose glazed oculus floods the rotunda with sunlight. Twin marble staircases lead from the rotunda to an imposing Caucus Room, which features Corinthian pilasters, a full entablature, and a richly detailed ceiling; the Russell Caucus Room (known since 2009 as the &quot;Kennedy Caucus Room&quot; in honor of Senators John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Edward M. Kennedy) retains its original 1910 benches and settles with carved eagles. This space has been used for many hearings on subjects of national significance, including the 1912 sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; hearings; the 1974 Watergate hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings, and the 1991 Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings. The rotunda contains a statue of Russell by sculptor Frederick Hart.

The Russell Building was occupied in 1909 by the Senate of the 61st Congress. The growth of staff and committees in the twenty years following its completion resulted in the addition of a fourth side, the First Street Wing, to the originally U-shaped building. Nathan C. Wyeth and Francis P. Sullivan were the consulting architects for the new wing, which was completed in 1933. The building was originally named the Senate Office Building. When the Dirksen Office Building was completed, it became the New Senate Office Building and the original Senate Office Building became the &quot;Old Senate Office Building&quot; until being renamed the Russell Building in 1972.

The building received extensive pop culture visual cachet in the 1970s when film footage of the southwest corner was regularly used to represent the headquarters of the fictional OSI organization in the TV series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;.

Chuck Schumer, the then-Senate Minority Leader announced on August 25, 2018, that he would introduce a resolution to rename the building after Senator John McCain from Arizona, who died of brain cancer earlier that day.

<doc id="840234" wikidata="Q40150" url="?curid=840234" title="Willem Claesz. Heda">
<text>Willem Claeszoon Heda (December 14, 1593/1594c. 1680/1682) was a Dutch Golden Age artist from the city of Haarlem devoted exclusively to the painting of still life. He is known for his innovation of the late breakfast genre of still life painting.

==Early life==

Heda was born in Haarlem, the son of the Haarlem city architect Claes Pietersz. His mother Anna Claesdr was a member of the Heda family. His uncle was the painter Cornelis Claesz Heda. Heda&#x27;s early life is all but unknown, with no surviving pieces dated to that period. Judging from his date of birth, scholars have speculated that Heda began painting around 1615.

His earliest known work was a &quot;Vanitas&quot; which fit the monochromatic and skillful texturing of his later pieces, but portrayed a subject matter distinct from the depictions of more sumptuous objects in his later years. This Vanitas, and the two other breakfast pieces by Heda in the 1620s were known for their clear deviation from earlier breakfast-pieces. The objects in these works demonstrate greater special effect and maintain a sense of balance for the viewer despite the uneven and diagonal grouping of objects. Additionally, these works adopted the monochromatic style contrary to early breakfast-pieces.

Heda&#x27;s skill was recognized early on in his career by other notable figures in Haarlem, such as Samuel Ampzing, a Dutch minister and poet from Haarlem, who captured the city in poetry. Heda won enough local fame in his own day for Ampzing to praise him in the same breath with Salomon de Bray and Pieter Claesz in his 1628 &quot;Beschryvinge ende lof der stad Haerlem in Holland&quot;. &quot;[I] ha[ve] to praise Heda with the banquet pieces of Solomon de bray and Pieter Claesz, their skill deserves to be mentioned in his poem.&quot;

Following his support from Samuel Ampzing, Heda became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.
As evidenced by his signing of a new charter to regularize the affairs of the guild on May 22, 1631, Heda was an active member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.

==Maturity==
Following his formative pieces of the 1620s, Heda reached his artistic maturity in the 1630s with pieces such as his 1631 still-life &quot;Breakfast table with blackberry pie&quot; and those of the &quot;1639 group&quot; sold to Vienna in the 1930s. These pieces contain perfectly draped fabric and assortments of fine glass and metal wares in addition to orderly-presented foodstuffs. This set of paintings is characterized by a sublime simplicity and order that few artists of his genre ever obtained. His coloration and illustration of light in the pieces, combined with fine additive brush strokes, results in an almost unbelievable level of realism.

Heda&#x27;s style continued to progress with his pieces of the 1640s developing a great simplicity founded upon a &quot;firm construction built up on broad lines.&quot; In this time, he also began to incorporate the crinkled napkin and knocked-over vases to his set of objects. This new set of objects presented a challenge to the artist to maintain cohesion and order in a clearly disordered environment. Though remnants of his more intimate pieces remained in this period, Heda began to add more objects to his works, experimenting with modified compositional styles.

The 1650s saw the introduction of a wider color-scheme. This change brought more fruit and curled leaves to his works, which combined with the crinkled napkins of the previous decade, resulted in a less firm character (in contrast to the glass and metal textures that he was previously known for).

==Final years==

Heda&#x27;s final years saw the artist begin the transition from the late breakfast still-life paintings he helped create, to the pronk, or display, still-life pieces of Willem Kalf in Amsterdam. His last known works were painted in 1664 (Private collection, The Hague) and 1665 (Museum del Monte, Brussels), and contained the warmer pallette of browns associated with Kalf&#x27;s pieces.

Though he lived until the 1680s, Heda&#x27;s last known paintings were created in the 1660s. Heda died in Haarlem in 1680 or 1682.

==Works==

Willem was a contemporary and comrade of Dirck Hals, akin to him in pictorial touch and technical execution. But Heda was more careful and finished than Hals, showing considerable skill and taste in the arrangement and colouring of his chased cups, beakers and tankards of both precious and inferior metals. Heda was also associated with the Haarlem artist and fellow still life painter, Floris van Dyck. In his work, &quot;Harlemias&quot;, the Dutch poet Theodorus Schrevelius acknowledged exceptional skill at his genre of painting. Heda and his contemporary and fellow still life painter, Floris van Dyck, were &quot;held in high esteem by the community as the best at painting their genre.&quot;

As a painter of &quot;ontbijt&quot; or breakfast pieces, he is often compared to his contemporary Pieter Claesz.

==Popularity==

Willem Claesz Heda&#x27;s skill was recognized in his own time by Samuel Ampzing, the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke, and Theodorus Schrevelius. Though Heda would clearly not be included in Het schilder-boeck of Karel van Mander, as its 1604 publishing fell before his rise to prominence, it would be expected that he would be included in the work of the next great Dutch art biographer Arnold Houbraken. Houbraken briefly mentioned Heda in the third volume of his work based on the biography by Schrevelius. Houbraken&#x27;s paltry inclusion of Heda in his &quot;Groote Schouburgh&quot; was probably due to nothing more than the lack of information about the artist. Houbraken&#x27;s antiquarian approach to artists&#x27; biographies meant that he published all of the information he had on each individual, and had he seen one of Heda&#x27;s pieces, he would have likely written more.

Houbraken&#x27;s scant mention of Heda was reflected in the works of his followers, Johan van Gool and Jacob Campo Weyerman. Neither of these individuals included Heda in their respective books.

As a result of the decline of Dutch art after the Dutch Golden Age, many countries began to ignore Dutch artworks. Jean-Baptiste Descamps a French artist who briefly studied in Antwerp became the first among modern art writers outside of the Netherlands to acknowledge the nation&#x27;s artistic importance. Although Descamps&#x27; writings included many inaccuracies, he described the Dutch masters, the van Eyck brothers among others, with personal observations that set him apart from many who ignored this genre. Following Descamps, Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville, a French writer and art connoisseur, cemented the shift in attitudes about the Dutch low genres. D&#x27;Argenville support for their unique style of genre painting. D&#x27;Argenville was in favor of treating all styles equally and believed that the preeminent artists of all fields should be valued for their skill over their subject matter. After attitudes towards genre paintings were changed, and Dutch art was once again in vogue, Willem Claesz Heda returned to prominence in the art world.

Heda was rediscovered by the French art critic Théophile Thoré in the 1860s. After seeing an example of his work at the Boijmans Museum in Rotterdam, Thoré praised Heda&#x27;s ability to make &quot;petite nature into a splendid celebration of life.&quot;

==Legacy==
Heda died in his native city of Haarlem in 1680 or 1682. Heda&#x27;s renewed popularity in the latter half of the 19th century resulted in the dissemination of his pieces throughout the world. His works can now be found on display in some of the world&#x27;s most famous museums: the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Louvre, Paris; the National Gallery, London; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Prado Museum and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid.

As one of the most recognized Dutch masters and one of the signature artists of the still life genre, his paintings feature in general surveys of art history as some of the highlights of Dutch seventeenth-century painting.
His pupils include Maerten Boelema de Stomme, Gerret Willemsz Heda, Hendrik Heerschop, and Arnold van Beresteijn.

<text>&quot;Wannabe&quot; is the debut single by the British girl group the Spice Girls, released on 26 June 1996. It was written by the Spice Girls, Matt Rowe and Richard &quot;Biff&quot; Stannard and produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, released in November 1996. The song was originally mixed by Dave Way, however the Spice Girls were not pleased with the result, and the recording was instead mixed by Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent. A dance-pop song, its lyrics address the value of female friendship over romantic relationships. It has since became a symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group&#x27;s girl power philosophy. 

&quot;Wannabe&quot; was heavily promoted. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a success on the British cable network the Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across England, while the Spice Girls performed it on television and began doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. Responding to the wave of interest, Virgin released the song as the Spice Girls&#x27; debut single in Japan in June 1996 and in the UK the following month, well ahead of the planned release of the &quot;Spice&quot; album. It was released in the United States in January 1997.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; earned mixed reviews from critics, but won for Best Selling British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards. It topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and received a quadruple platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). By the end of 1996, &quot;Wannabe&quot; had topped the charts in 22 nations—including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—and by the end of 1997, it topped the charts in 37. It became the best-selling single by a girl group, and, in a 2014 study, was found to be the most recognisable pop song of the last 60 years among young English speakers. An EP, &quot;Wannabe 25,&quot; was released in 2021 for the single&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

==Background==
In March 1994, father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert, together with financer Chic Murphy, working under the business name of Heart Management, placed an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot;, which asked the question: &quot;Are you street smart, extrovert, ambitious, and able to sing and dance?&quot; After receiving hundreds of replies, the management had narrowed their search to a group of five girls: Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm, Geri Halliwell, and Michelle Stephenson. The group moved to a house in Maidenhead and received the name &quot;Touch&quot;. Stephenson was eventually fired because she lacked the drive of the other group members. She was replaced by Emma Bunton. In November, the group—now named &quot;Spice&quot;—persuaded their managers to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers, and A&amp;R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard, at the studio for a meeting with pop star Jason Donovan, attended the showcase after hearing Brown, as she went charging across the corridor. Stannard recalled:

More than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d walked into this situation. You didn&#x27;t care if they were in time with the dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn&#x27;t as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.

Stannard stayed behind after the showcase to talk to the group. He then reported to his songwriter partner, Matt Rowe, that he had found &quot;the pop group of their dreams&quot;. Chris Herbert booked the group&#x27;s first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London, in January 1995. Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard&#x27;s: &quot;I love them. Immediately. ... They were like no one I&#x27;d met before, really.&quot; The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted to do on the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalls that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate &quot;the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music&quot;.

==Writing==
The first song the Spice Girls wrote with Stannard and Rowe was called &quot;Feed Your Love&quot;, a slow and soulful song that was recorded and mastered for the group&#x27;s debut album; the song was not used because it was considered too sexually explicit for the target audience. The group next proposed to write a track with an uptempo dance-pop rhythm. Rowe set up a drum loop on his MPC3000 drum machine. Its fast rhythm reminded Stannard of the scene in &quot;Grease&quot;. Stannard commented that the only pre-planned concept for the song was that it should represent the essence of what they were. The group then added their own contributions to the song, Rowe recalls:

They made all these different bits up, not thinking in terms of verse, chorus, bridge or what was going to go where, just coming up with all these sections of chanting, rapping and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy. And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we&#x27;d been working on the dance remixes we&#x27;d been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; was completed in 30 minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a &quot;sudden creative frenzy&quot;. During the session, Brown and Bunton came up with the idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group became highly motivated, and incorporated the word &quot;zigazig-ah&quot; into the lyrics. Chisholm told &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;You know when you&#x27;re in a gang and you&#x27;re having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ah. We were in the studio and it all came together in this song.&quot;

==Recording and production==
While most of the other songs on the &quot;Spice&quot; album required two or three days of studio time, &quot;Wannabe&quot; was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Adams missed most of the writing session and communicated with the rest of the group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn&#x27;t matter, it did matter. Saying &#x27;Yes, I like that&#x27; or &#x27;Not sure about that&#x27; down the phone is not the same.&quot; She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown&#x27;s footsteps as she ran to the microphone.

The group parted with Heart Management in March 1995 because of their frustration with the management company&#x27;s unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. The girls met with artist manager Simon Fuller, who signed them with 19 Entertainment. The group considered a variety of record labels, and signed a deal with Virgin Records in July. The original mix of &quot;Wannabe&quot; was considered lacklustre by Virgin executives. Ashley Newton, who was in charge of A&amp;R, sent the song to American producer Dave Way for remixing; the result was not what the group had hoped to achieve. As Halliwell later described it, &quot;the result was bloody awful&quot;. She elaborated in her second autobiography, &quot;Just for the Record:&quot; &quot;Right at the beginning of the Spice Girls, ... Ashley Newton had tried to turn us into an R&amp;B group ... He brought us jungle versions and hip-hop mixes and I hated them all. Although Mel B was a big fan of R&amp;B, she agreed with me that these versions just didn&#x27;t work so we exercised our Spice veto!&quot; Fuller gave the song to audio engineer Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent, who thought that it was a &quot;weird pop record&quot;. Stent remixed it in six hours, in what he described as &quot;tightening it up&quot; and &quot;getting the vocals sounding really good.&quot;

==Composition==

&quot;Wannabe&quot; is a dance-pop song with influences of hip hop and rap. Written in the key of B major, it is set in the time signature of common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 110 beats per minute. It uses the sequence B–D–E–A–A♯ as a bass line during the refrain, the chorus, and the bridge, and uses a chord progression of F♯–G♯m–E–B for the verses. The song is constructed in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a rapped bridge before the third and final chorus. Musically, it is &quot;energised&quot; by a highly syncopated synthesised riff, and by the way the repetitive lyrics and rhythm are highlighted during the bridge. &quot;Wannabe&quot; presents a different version of the traditional pop love song performed by females; its energetic, self-assertive style expresses a confident independence that is not reliant on the male figure for its continuance.

The song opens with Halliwell&#x27;s laugh, followed by &quot;undislodgeable piano notes&quot; inspired by the &quot;Grease&quot; &quot;Summer Nights&quot; bassline. The first lines of the refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between Brown and Halliwell. The words &quot;tell&quot;, &quot;really&quot; and &quot;I wanna&quot; are repeated, so that the vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self-assertion. The refrain ends with the word &quot;zigazig-ah&quot;, which musicologist Sheila Whiteley compared to the neologisms created by Lewis Carroll; other writers have considered it a euphemism for female sexual desire, which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic. The first verse follows; Chisholm, Bunton, Brown, and Halliwell sing one line individually, in that order. In this part, the lyrics have a pragmatic sense of control of the situation; they begin, &quot;If you want my future, forget my past.&quot; This, according to Whiteley, taps directly into the emotions of the young teenage audience.

During the chorus, the lyrics—&quot;If you wanna be my lover/You gotta get with my friends&quot;—address the value of female friendship over romantic relationships, while the ascending group of chords and the number of voices creates a sense of power that adds to the song&#x27;s level of excitement. The same pattern occurs, leading to the second chorus. Towards the end, Brown and Halliwell rap the bridge, which serves as a presentation to each of the girls&#x27; personalities. The group repeats the chorus for the last time, ending the song with energetic refrains— &quot;Slam your body down and wind it all around&quot;—and the word &quot;zigazig-ah&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

After signing the group, Virgin Records launched a major campaign for their debut song to promote them as the new high-profile act. There was a period of indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be &quot;Wannabe&quot;, they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin&#x27;s executives believed that the first single should either be &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, which they considered a much &quot;cooler&quot; track, or &quot;Love Thing&quot;. At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that &quot;Wannabe&quot; should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, &quot;It&#x27;s not negotiable as far as we&#x27;re concerned. &#x27;Wannabe&#x27; is our first single.&quot; Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.

The trigger for the Spice Girls&#x27; launch was the release of the &quot;Wannabe&quot; music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial resistance to the all-girl group idea. The same month, their first music press interviews appeared in &quot;Music Week&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, and their first live TV slot was broadcast on LWT&#x27;s &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;. A month after the video&#x27;s release, the song was receiving intensive airplay on the main radio stations across the UK, while the group started to appear on television—mainly on kid&#x27;s programmes such as &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;—and doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. A full-page advertisement appeared in the July issue of &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, saying: &quot;Wanted: Anyone with a sense of fun, freedom and adventure. Hold tight, get ready! Girl Power is comin&#x27; at you&quot;. The group appeared on the television programme &quot;This Morning with Richard and Judy&quot;, and performed at their first Radio One road show in Birmingham.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; was first released in Japan on 26 June 1996 as a maxi CD. In the United Kingdom, the song was issued on 8 July 1996 in two single versions. The first one, released in two formats—a standard CD single and a cassette single—include the radio edit of the track, the Motiv 8 vocal slam remix, and the B-side, &quot;Bumper to Bumper&quot;. The group wrote &quot;Bumper to Bumper&quot; with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins—the songwriter-production duo known as Absolute—and British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis. The second version, released on maxi single format on 15 July, feature the radio edit, an instrumental version, the Motiv 8 dub slam remix, and the Dave Way alternative mix. This version came with a fold-out postcard inlay and a stickered case.

During the weeks following the UK release, the group began promotional visits abroad. They did three trips to Japan and brief visits to Germany and the Netherlands. On a trip to the Far East, they visited Hong Kong, Thailand, and South Korea. In January 1997 they travelled to North America to do a promotional campaign that Phil Quartararo, president of Virgin Records America, described as &quot;absolutely massive&quot;. In Canada, the group did interviews for newspapers and radio stations, appeared in television programmes such as &quot;Hit List&quot;, and &quot;MusiquePlus&quot;, and attended an autograph signing at Montreal&#x27;s HMV Megastore. During their visit to the US, the group met with influential radio programmers, TV networks, and magazines. In addition, the music video was placed into heavy rotation by MTV.

==Critical reception==
===UK reviews===
&quot;Wannabe&quot; received mixed reviews from UK music critics. Paul Gorman of &quot;Music Week&quot; called the group &quot;smart, witty, abrasive and downright fun&quot;. He described the song as a &quot;R&amp;B-lite debut single&quot;, and noted influences from Neneh Cherry in it. In a review conducted by the British pop band Deuce for &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine, the group described &quot;Wannabe&quot; as &quot;limp&quot;, &quot;awful&quot;, and &quot;not strong enough for a debut single.&quot; Kate Thornton, editor of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine, commented that the all-girl group idea was &quot;not going to happen;&quot; she considered it too threatening. In her review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan called it a combination of &quot;cute hip pop and a vaguely feminist lyric&quot;, she was also surprised that &quot;considering the slightness of &#x27;Wannabe,&#x27;&quot; the group had an overwhelming amount of offers from record companies. 

&quot;NME&quot; characterised the song as &quot;a combined force of Bananarama, Betty Boo and Shampoo rolled into one.&quot; Dele Fadele of the same magazine called the rap during the song&#x27;s bridge &quot;annoying&quot;, and added, writing of the group&#x27;s music: &quot;It&#x27;s not good. It&#x27;s not clever. But it&#x27;s fun.&quot; The magazine named &quot;Wannabe&quot; the worst single of the year at the 1997 NME Awards. Conversely, it won for Best Single at the 1997 BRIT Awards, and for International Hit of the Year and Best Selling British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards presented by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. The song was ranked number five by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in their list of &quot;Singles of the Year&quot; in December 1996. VH1 ranked it number 33 in their &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90s&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 111 on their 2011 list of &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;.

===US reviews===
In the United States, reaction to the song was also mixed. In a review of the group&#x27;s debut album, Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; said that &quot;Wannabe&quot; is &quot;a melodious but disposable tune that typifies this debut&#x27;s tart bubblegum and packaged sexiness.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;insidiously snappy, ... [that] is shaping up as this year&#x27;s &#x27;Macarena.&#x27;&quot; Karla Peterson of &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; said that &quot;&#x27;Wannabe&#x27; has UGH written all over it,&quot; adding that it was &quot;relentlessly catchy and horrifyingly hummable&quot;. &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;″s Anthony Violanti called it &quot;irresistible&quot;. Sarah Rodman of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described it as a &quot;maniacally zippy single&quot;, and Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; referred to it as an &quot;unapologetically sassy dance hit&quot;. Melissa Ruggieri of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; commented that &quot;based on their efficacious American debut single, ... the Spice Girls might be expected to deliver more of that zingy pop on their debut album,&quot; but she felt that &quot;aside from &#x27;Wannabe,&#x27; the album&#x27;s dance tracks are color-by-numbers bland.&quot; Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said that &quot;fans of the more edgy girl-group ... may find this single too fluffy&quot; but added that &quot;everyone else with a love of tasty pop hooks, lyrical positivity, and jaunty rhythms is going to be humming this single for months to come.&quot;

Some reviewers noticed the combination of musical genres. Christina Kelly from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine criticised the group&#x27;s image, and added that their songs, including &quot;Wannabe&quot;, were &quot;a watered-down mix of hip-hop and cheesy pop balladry, brought together by a manager with a marketing concept.&quot; Matt Diehl of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it was &quot;more a compendium of music styles (from ABBA-style choruses to unconvincing hip hop) than an actual song,&quot; and Sara Scribner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;a bubblegum hip-hop confection of rapping lifted off Neneh Cherry and Monie Love albums.&quot; Charles Aaron of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine called it &quot;a quickie, mid-&#x27;80s teen paperback come to life ... so gooey it melts in your hands, not in your mouth&quot; (an apparent reference to the M&amp;M&#x27;s slogan &quot;melts in your mouth, not in your hands&quot;). The song ranked at fifteenth in the American Pazz &amp; Jop, a nationwide critics poll published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and conducted by its music editor Robert Christgau, who called it &quot;a classic&quot;.

===Retrospective reviews===
Present-day reviews from critics, however, are mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;none of the girls have great voices, but they do exude personality and charisma, which is what drives bouncy dance-pop like &#x27;Wannabe,&#x27; with its ridiculous &#x27;zig-a-zig-ahhh&#x27; hook, into pure pop guilty pleasure.&quot; Dan Cairns of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; said that the song &quot;leaves a bad taste in the mouth: [because] the true legacy of Girl Power is, arguably, a preteen clothing industry selling crop tops and other minimal garments to young girls,&quot; but added that it &quot;remains the same two minutes and 53 seconds of pop perfection that it ever was.&quot; In a review of their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, IGN said that after ten years it &quot;still sound reasonably fresh&quot;, while Digital Spy&#x27;s Nick Levine said that &quot;Wannabe&quot; still remained an &quot;exuberant calling card&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; named the song #5 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time and the Best Pop Song of 1997.

==Chart performance==

As part of Virgin&#x27;s strategy to make the group an international act, &quot;Wannabe&quot; was released in Japan and Southeast Asia two weeks before its British release. After the song was placed into heavy rotation on FM stations in Japan, the Spice Girls made promotional tours in May, July, and September 1996. The group received major press and TV exposure, appearing in programmes such as &quot;Space Shower&quot;. The single was released by Toshiba EMI on 26 June 1996, and sold 100,000 copies by October 1996.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number three, six days after its physical release, with sales of 73,000 copies. It climbed to number one the next week, and spent seven weeks at the top, the second-longest stay by an all-female group, only behind Shakespears Sister&#x27;s &quot;Stay&quot;. With eighteen weeks in the top forty and twenty-six weeks in the top seventy-five, it became the second-biggest selling single of the year, and as of November 2012 has sold over 1.38 million copies, the biggest-selling single by a female group in the UK.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; was commercially successful in the rest of Europe. On 4 September 1996 the song reached the top of the Eurochart Hot 100, where it stayed for nine consecutive weeks, when it was replaced by the group&#x27;s second single, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. &quot;Wannabe&quot; topped the singles charts in Belgium (both the Flemish and French charts), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, and peaked inside the top five in Austria, the Czech Republic, and Italy. The song was a success in Oceania. In Australia, it debuted at number sixty-four, reached the top of the ARIA Charts for eleven weeks, and ended at number five on the 1996 year-end chart. In New Zealand, it debuted on 1 September 1996 at number thirty-eight, reaching the top position ten weeks later. It spent one week at the top and seventeen consecutive weeks inside the top ten. &quot;Wannabe&quot; also topped the singles charts in Hong Kong and Israel.

In Canada, it debuted at the eighty-ninth position of the &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart on the week beginning 16 December 1996, a full month before it hit the US charts. It peaked at nine in its eighth week, and ended at number sixty-eight on the year-end chart. The song performed better on the dance chart, where it reached the top for three weeks, and ended at the top of the year-end chart. In the US, the song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 25 January 1997 at number eleven, the highest-ever debut by a British act at the time. It reached the top of the chart in its fifth week, and stayed there for four consecutive weeks simultaneously with the group&#x27;s fourth single (&quot;Mama&quot;/&quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;) being at number one in the UK. &quot;Wannabe&quot; reached the sixth position of the Hot 100 Airplay chart, and topped the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart for four consecutive weeks, selling over 1.8 million copies as of January 1998. It peaked at four on the Mainstream Top 40, and was a crossover success, topping the Rhythmic Top 40, peaking at twenty on the Hot Dance Club Play and at nine on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. New remixes of the song were produced in 2007 in conjunction with the release of their Greatest Hits CD and these rose to number 15 on the Billboard Dance Charts. &quot;Wannabe&quot; also remains the best selling song by a female group in the United States with 2,910,000 physical singles and downloads combined, according to Nielsen SoundScan in 2014.

==Music video==
===Background===

The music video for &quot;Wannabe&quot; was the first for Swedish director Johan Camitz. Camitz was hired on Fuller&#x27;s recommendation because of his commercials for Volkswagen, Diesel, and Nike. His original concept for the video was a one-take shoot of the group arriving at an exotic building in Barcelona, taking over the place, and running riot—the same way they did when they were looking for a manager and a record company. A few days before the shoot on 19 April 1996, Camitz was unable to get permission to use the building, and the shoot was relocated to the Midland Grand Hotel in St Pancras, London.

The video features the Spice Girls running, singing, dancing, and creating mischief at an eccentric bohemian party. Because the video was intended to be filmed in one shot, the group rehearsed the routine several times through the night, while a Steadicam operator followed them. The final video was cut together from two takes. Halliwell wrote: &quot;The video I remember as being very chaotic and cold. It wasn&#x27;t very controlled—we didn&#x27;t want it to be. We wanted the camera to capture the madness of the Spice Girls.&quot; Virgin&#x27;s executives were horrified; Newtown recalled that &quot;the girls were freezing cold, which showed itself in various different ways&quot;. The video was banned in some parts of Asia because of Brown&#x27;s erect nipples. The lighting was considered too dark; the best takes showed the girls bumping with the furniture and looking behind them. Virgin was concerned that old people appeared in the video, and worried that the scenes of the Spice Girls jumping on a table and Halliwell&#x27;s showgirl outfit might be considered threatening by music channels. Virgin began discussions about a re-shoot or creating an alternate one for the US, but the Spice Girls refused. The video was sent for trial airing in its original form in January 1997.

===Reception===
When the music video first appeared on the British cable network the Box, it was selected so frequently that it reached the top of the viewers&#x27; chart within two hours. It stayed at number one for thirteen weeks until it was replaced by the Spice Girls&#x27; next music video, for &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. At its peak, up to fifteen per cent of the 250,000 weekly telephone requests to the Box were for &quot;Wannabe&quot;, and it was aired up to seventy times a week, becoming the most requested track in the channel&#x27;s history. &quot;Wannabe&quot; won Best Dance Video at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, and Best Video at the 1997 Comet Media Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Video at the 1997 BRIT Awards and was ranked at number forty-one in the 100 Greatest Pop Videos of all time by Channel 4.

In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; included the video for &quot;Wannabe&quot; in their list of the Top Ten Most Iconic Girl Group Music Videos of All Time, noting: &quot;They were basically unknown to U.S. audiences when the video for debut single &#x27;Wannabe&#x27; -- a riotous, one-shot stroll through the Girls gleefully messing up some posh U.K. soiree -- premiered, but by the end of the four-minute clip, we knew absolutely everything we needed to know about the Spice Girls. You get the individual personalities of all five members, the infectious togetherness of the group at large, and most importantly, the sense that they were coming to absolutely blast through American pop music and mess up everything we previously thought we knew.&quot;

To coincide with the Spice25 release on 29 October 2021, the Spice Girls released a lyric video for &quot;Wannabe&quot;, set inside the Midland Grand Hotel.

==Live performances==

The Spice Girls were in Japan when &quot;Wannabe&quot; went to number one in the UK. The group made their first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; by satellite link from Tokyo, where they used a local temple as a backdrop for their mimed performance. They performed the song several more times on the show, including the programme&#x27;s 1996 Christmas special. It was performed many times on television, in both Europe and the US, including &quot;An Audience with...&quot;, the &quot;Bravo Supershow&quot;, &quot;Sorpresa¡ Sorpresa!&quot;, &quot;Fully Booked&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The performance at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 12 April 1997 was featured in the 5-part TV musical special &quot;SNL: 25 Years of Music&quot;, and was the first time the group ever performed &quot;Wannabe&quot; with a live band—their previous performances had all been either lip-synched or sung to a recorded backing track.

The group performed it at awards ceremonies such as the 1996 Smash Hits! Awards, the 1996 Irish Music Awards, the 1997 BRIT Awards, and the 1997 Channel V Music Awards held in New Delhi, where they wore Indian costumes and entered the stage in auto rickshaws. In October 1997 the group performed &quot;Wannabe&quot; as the last song of their first live concert at the Abdi İpekçi Arena in Istanbul, Turkey. The performance was broadcast on Showtime in a pay-per-view event titled &quot;Spice Girls in Concert Wild!&quot;, and was later included in the VHS and DVD release &quot;Girl Power! Live in Istanbul&quot;.

The Spice Girls have performed the song on their four tours, the Spiceworld Tour, the Christmas in Spiceworld Tour, the Return of the Spice Girls Tour and the Spice World - 2019 Tour. After a breast-cancer scare led Geri Halliwell to leave the team at the end of the European leg of the Spiceworld Tour, her parts were replaced by Melanie Chisholm (refrain), Victoria Adams (verses), and Bunton (bridge). The performance at the tour&#x27;s final concert can be found on the video &quot;Spice Girls Live at Wembley Stadium&quot;, filmed in London, on 20 September 1998. The group performed the song on 12 August 2012 at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London as part of a medley with the song &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;. It was also performed as the closing song on the Spice World - 2019 Tour.

==Legacy==
As the Spice Girls&#x27; debut single, &quot;Wannabe&quot; has been credited for catapulting the band to global stardom and ushering in &quot;Spicemania&quot; in the late 1990s. Commentators have noted that the song and its accompanying video, both now considered modern pop classics, served as a wonderful introduction to the band. The &quot;Metro&#x27;s&quot; Jon O’Brien concluded that: &quot;From its lyrical themes of female solidarity to its insanely catchy pop hooks and mischief-making promo, the worldwide chart-topper encapsulated everything that made the group so spellbinding in the space of just two minutes and 52 seconds.&quot; &quot;Digital Spy&#x27;s&quot; Lewis Corner agreed, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine any other pop act managing to make this much of an impact so quickly and effortlessly ever again.&quot;

&quot;Wannabe&quot; has also been credited with changing the mid-1990s pop music landscape, pioneering the teen pop boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Robert Copsey, editor at the UK&#x27;s &quot;Official Charts Company&quot; explained: &quot;There was nothing else quite like Wannabe on the radio back in summer 1996. Rock and dance music had been dominating the airwaves and charts for quite some time by that point. The Spice Girls struck at just the right moment with Wannabe; a gutsy, enthusiastic and unashamed pop song we&#x27;d all been craving without even realising it.&quot;

&quot;Wannabe&quot; has been hailed as an &quot;iconic girl power anthem&quot;. In 2016, the United Nations&#x27; Global Goals &quot;#WhatIReallyReallyWant&quot; campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian &quot;viral sensation&quot; Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world, including a set of stairs reminiscent of the Midland Grand Hotel steps from the original music video. The campaign also encouraged people from all over the world to use the hashtag &quot;#WhatIReallyReallyWant&quot;, taken from the song&#x27;s lyrics, to share what they wanted for girls and women by 2030. In response to the campaign, Beckham said, &quot;How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls’ girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?&quot;

In 2014, a study at the University of Amsterdam with the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester found that &quot;Wannabe&quot; is the most recognisable and catchy pop song of the last 60 years among young English speakers. The study found that &quot;Wannabe&quot;’s simple and relentless melody was the key to its success, with lead musicologist Dr John Ashley Burgoyne concluding, &quot;I would describe the song as truly relentlessly catchy. It&#x27;s not that it has this one hook per se. It&#x27;s quite ingeniously composed.&quot; On Spotify, &quot;Wannabe&quot; was the most streamed 1990s song by a female group or artist in 2020.

An EP, &quot;Wannabe 25,&quot; was released on 9 July 2021 to mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Wannabe&quot;. The EP included the previously unreleased demos of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;Feed Your Love&quot;.

On 31 December 2023, &quot;Wannabe&quot; reached 1 billion streams on Spotify. Spice Girls became the first British girl group to reach the milestone and the second girl group overall, along with Fifth Harmony&#x27;s &quot;Work from Home&quot;.

==Cover versions==
Cover versions of &quot;Wannabe&quot; have been included in the albums of various musical artists. In 1998 American retro-satirist duo the Lounge-O-Leers did a kitschy, lounge-inspired rendition of &quot;Wannabe&quot; for their debut album, &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot;. British intelligent dance music producer μ-Ziq recorded a cover for his fourth album, &quot;Lunatic Harness&quot;. The London Double Bass Sound recorded an instrumental version in 1999, a dance remix was recorded by Jan Stevens, Denise Nejame, and Sybersound for the 1997 album &quot;Sybersound Dance Mixes, Vol. 2&quot;, while an electronic version was recorded by the Street Girls for the 2005 album &quot;The World of Hits of the 80&#x27;s&quot;. In 1999 the song was used in &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s polka medley, &quot;Polka Power!&quot;, for his tenth album, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;. Covers of the song in a punk style include a thrash parody version by British punk rock band Snuff for their 1998 EP, &quot;Schminkie Minkie Pinkie&quot;, a punk rock version by Dutch band Heideroosjes for their 1999 album, &quot;Schizo&quot;, and a pop punk cover by Zebrahead for their 2004 EP, &quot;Waste of MFZB&quot;. In 2013, Brazilian funk carioca singers , MC Mercenária, MC Baby Liss and DZ MC released a version of the song, called &quot;Mereço Muito Mais&quot; (en: &quot;I Deserve More&quot;), and a music video inspired by the original. The 2019 single &quot;Spicy&quot;, by Diplo, Herve Pagez and Charli XCX, is a reworking of &quot;Wannabe&quot;.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; has also been covered in live concert sets by numerous musical artists, including Australian duo the Veronicas, American rock band the Foo Fighters, Filipina superstar Regine Velasquez and American pop rock band DNCE. K-pop girl group Girls&#x27; Generation covered the song on the popular South Korean radio program Super Junior Kiss the Radio in 2009 and did a live performance of the song on the South Korean television music program Kim Jung-eun&#x27;s Chocolate in 2010. In 2013, American girl group Fifth Harmony dressed up as the Spice Girls for Halloween and performed &quot;Wannabe&quot; at their New York show. The performance was also uploaded on their official YouTube channel. In April 2017, indie punk band the Tuts recorded and filmed a music video for their cover of &quot;Wannabe&quot;.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; has also been performed by the characters of various films. The cover versions of the song were included in the official soundtracks of Disney&#x27;s 2005 animated film &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s 2012 animated film &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and the 2004 American teen film &quot;Sleepover&quot;.

&quot;Wannabe&quot; has also been covered in numerous TV shows. The characters Brittany (Heather Morris), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), Marley (Melissa Benoist), Kitty (Becca Tobin) and Unique (Alex Newell) dressed up as the Spice Girls and performed the song on the 17th episode of the fourth season of &quot;Glee&quot;. In 2015, the song was sung by Ed Helms and the Muppets in the fourth episode of the first season of &quot;The Muppets&quot; TV series. The song was also performed by Peter Griffin in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The New Adventures of Old Tom&quot;, and used in the ITV2 TV adverts for the programme&#x27;s 14th season. The cast of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Fuller House&quot; also performed the song in the season one finale &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;. &quot;Wannabe&quot; was performed, along with another Spice Girls song, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, with revised lyrics, in the second episode of the 41st season of Saturday Night Live by host Amy Schumer and cast members Cecily Strong and Taran Killam. &quot;Wannabe&quot; has also been used in three episodes of Fox animated series &quot;The Simpsons;&quot; the song was sung by Homer Simpson in the episodes &quot;Maximum Homerdrive&quot; and &quot;Fraudcast News&quot;, and sung by Ralph Wiggum in the episode &quot;How the Test Was Won&quot;. The 2007 season four finale of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; featured the female characters dancing as a group to the song. It was also used in the trailer for the film &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; (1997). On 3 October 2012, Geri Halliwell performed the song as a solo during a breast-cancer care show. (She had resigned from Spice Girls as a result of a breast-cancer scare, as noted above.) Her solo version was an acoustic ballad with several lyrics changed, such as &quot;you&#x27;ve gotta get with my friends&quot; being changed to &quot;you&#x27;ve gotta be my best friend&quot;.

In 2016, American actress Eva Longoria performed a comedic dramatic reading of &quot;Wannabe&quot; in honour of the 20th anniversary of the album &quot;Spice&quot;. For the 21st anniversary of the song in July 2017, &quot;W magazine&quot; had various celebrities perform &quot;Wannabe&quot;, including Nicole Kidman, James Franco, Riz Ahmed, Milo Ventimiglia, Millie Bobby Brown and Keri Russell.

<text>The Architect of the Capitol is the federal agency responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the United States Capitol Complex. It is an agency of the legislative branch of the federal government and is accountable to the United States Congress and the Supreme Court. Both the agency and the head of the agency are called &quot;Architect of the Capitol&quot;.The head of the agency is appointed by a vote of a congressional commission for a ten-year term. Prior to 2024, the president of the United States appointed the Architect upon confirmation vote by the United States Senate, and was accountable to the president.

==Overview==
The agency had 2,444 employees and an annual budget of approximately $788 million as of September 2022.

The head of the agency sits on the Capitol Police Board, which has jurisdiction over the United States Capitol Police, and on the United States Capitol Guide Board, which has jurisdiction over the United States Capitol Guide Service.

Until 1989, the architect of the Capitol was appointed by the president of the United States for an indefinite term. Legislation in 1989 provides that the president appoints the architect for a term of ten years, with the advice and consent of the Senate, from a list of three candidates recommended by a congressional commission composed of the speaker of the House, president pro tem of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate, and the chair and ranking members of the House Committee on House Administration, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Beginning in 2024, the architect is appointed by a commission of the Senate and House and is eligible for reappointment after completion of a 10 year term.

==Responsibility==

The Architect of the Capitol is responsible to Congress and the Supreme Court for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of of buildings and more than of land throughout Capitol Hill.

The office is also responsible for the upkeep and improvement of the Capitol grounds, and the arrangement of inaugural ceremonies and other ceremonies held in the building or on the grounds. Legislation over the years has placed additional buildings and grounds under the Architect of the Capitol.
The Capitol Complex includes:
* the Capitol
* Capitol Visitor Center

<text>Jan Davidsz. de Heem or in-full &quot;Jan Davidszoon de Heem&quot;, also called &quot;Johannes de Heem&quot; or &quot;Johannes van Antwerpen&quot; or &quot;Jan Davidsz de Hem&quot; (c. 17 April 1606 in Utrecht – before 26 April 1684 in Antwerp), was a still life painter who was active in Utrecht and Antwerp. He is a major representative of that genre in both Dutch and Flemish Baroque painting.

==Life==

De Heem was born in Utrecht as &quot;Johannes van Antwerpen&quot;. He studied first under his father David de Heem the Elder (1570–1631), then under Balthasar van der Ast. His &quot;middle name&quot;, Davidsz, is a patronym referring to his father&#x27;s name: In Dutch a name ending in -sz is like -son in English and Mac- in Scottish, meaning &quot;son of&quot; the rest of the name. He lived in Leiden from about 1625 to 1629, where he studied in 1629 under David Bailly (1584- c. 1657). His professional name, &quot;de Heem&quot;, means literally &quot;the home&quot;.

He moved to the Southern Netherlands and joined the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp in 1635 or 1636 and became a burgher of that city in 1637. However he was often absent, as attested by the duties he had to pay for this. His remarkable talent gained him a considerable reputation. He could hardly satisfy the demand. De Heem was considered one of the greatest painters of his time. He was well paid and a portrait of Prince William III surrounded by a cartouche of flowers and fruit was sold for 2000 guilders, one of the highest prices ever paid for a painting during the Dutch Golden Age. His sons worked together with him in his workshop on the commissions for new paintings. He retouched their work and put his signature on the paintings.

He remained in Antwerp until 1667, when he moved back to Utrecht, where records trace his presence from 1668 to 1671. He left Utrecht in 1671 when French troops were approaching the city. It is not known when he finally returned to Antwerp, but his death there is recorded in the guild books.

Van Heem married twice, first with Alette van Weede with whom he had three surviving children on her death in 1643, one of which, Cornelis, would become a still life painter. He married a second time in 1644 with Anna Catherina Ruckers with whom he had six more children, one of whom was Jan who would also become a still life painter.

Apart from his two sons, he had several apprentices: Michiel Verstylen, Alexander Coosemans, Thomas de Klerck, Lenaert Rougghe, Theodor Aenvanck, Andries Benedetti, Elias van den Broeck, Jacob Marrel, Hendrik Schoock and Abraham Mignon.

==Work==
De Heem was one of the greatest painters of still lifes in the Netherlands, combining a brilliance and harmony of colour along with an accurate rendering of objects: flowers, in all their variety; European and tropical fruits; lobsters and oysters; butterflies and moths; stone and metal; snails and sea shells.

His still lifes included fruit pieces, vanitas still lifes and flower pieces, but he is best known for his ornate or sumptuous still lifes, the so-called &#x27;pronkstillevens&#x27;. Some of his works are displays of abundance; others, only a festoon or a nosegay.

Often he would convey a moral or illustrate a motto: a snake lying coiled under grass; a skull on plants in bloom. Gold and silver cups or tankards are suggestive of the vanity of earthly possessions. Salvation is seen allegorically as a chalice amid blossoms, and death as a crucifix in a wreath. Sometimes de Heem painted, alone or with others, Madonnas or portraits in garlands of fruit or flowers.

His signature varied: his initials (J. De Heem f.), or Johannes (IOANNES DE HEEM F.), or his father&#x27;s name adjoined to his own (J. D. De Heem f.). Occasionally he provided a date (such as A. i65i), especially with his best work.
==Collections==
Of the one hundred or more of his pictures seen in European galleries, only 18 are dated. An early work shows a chased tankard with a bottle, a silver cup and a lemon on a marble table, dated 1640, in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. A similar work of 1645, with the addition of fruit, flowers and a distant landscape, is at Longford Castle. A chalice in a wreath, with a radiant bouquet among wheat sheaves, grapes and flowers, is a masterpiece of 1648 in the Belvedere of Vienna. A wreath around a life-sized Madonna, dated 1650, in the museum of Berlin, shows that de Heem could paint brightly and harmoniously on a large scale. The Prado Museum owns a &quot;Table&quot; dated around 1651 and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum houses &quot;Flowers in a glass Vase with Fruit&quot; circa 1665.

In the Alte Pinakothek in Munich is a celebrated work of 1653 in which creepers mingle beautifully with gourds, blackberries, orange, myrtle and peach, and further enlivened with butterflies, moths and beetles. A landscape with a blooming rose tree, a jug of strawberries, a selection of fruit, and a marble bust of Pan, dated 1655, is in the Hermitage in St Petersburg. Some of his works are kept at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. A 1645 still life of a feast of fruit and lobster is in the gallery at the Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio. A simple still life of pewter goblets can be seen in the Barber Institute in Birmingham UK.

==Family==
A number of de Heems, of whom Jan Davidsz. was the most distinguished, painted works in similar styles, that are often hard to distinguish. These include a brother, two sons, of whom Cornelis became particularly successful, and at least one grandson by each son.

This family of painters started with the unknown father of David de Heem the Elder (1570–1631) and an unknown brother. This anonymous brother had a son, Jan or Johannes de Heem (c. 1603 - † probably after 1659), a painter of still lifes, flowers and fruits.

David de Heem the Elder had two sons, also painters: Jan Davidsz. de Heem (1606- † before 26 April 1684) and David Davidsz. de Heem (1610 - † after 1669).

Jan Davidsz. de Heem had three sons, all painters; from a first marriage: David Janszoon de Heem (29 November 1628 - † ?), Cornelis de Heem (1631–1695) and from a second marriage Jan de Heem (1650 - † ?).

Cornelis de Heem had one son who was a painter: David Corneliszoon de Heem (1663–1718).

<doc id="840252" wikidata="Q284896" url="?curid=840252" title="Yucca baccata">
<text>Yucca baccata (datil yucca or banana yucca, also known as Spanish bayonet and broadleaf yucca) is a common species of yucca native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, from southeastern California north to Utah, east to western Texas and south to Sonora and Chihuahua. It is also reported in the wild in Colombia.

The species gets its common name &quot;banana yucca&quot; from its banana-shaped fruit. The specific epithet &quot;baccata&quot; means &#x27;with berries&#x27;. Banana yucca is closely related to the &quot;Yucca schidigera&quot;, the Mojave yucca, with which it is interspersed where their ranges overlap; hybrids between them occur.

== Description ==
&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; is recognized by having leaves long with a blue-green color, and short or nonexistent trunks. It flowers in the spring, starting in April to July depending on locality (altitude), and the flowers range from long, in six segments, white to cream-coloured with purple shades. The flower stalk is not especially tall, typically . The seeds are rough, black, wingless, long and wide, thick; they ripen in 6–8 weeks. The indehiscent fleshy fruit is long and across, cylindrical, and tastes similar to sweet potato.

==Subspecies==
&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; has been divided into three varieties:
*&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; var. &quot;baccata&quot;
*&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; var. &quot;brevifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; var. &quot;vespertina&quot; 

As of 2023 the status of these subspecies is uncertain. In Plants of the World Online (POWO) and World Flora Online only &quot;Yucca baccata&quot; var. &quot;brevifolia&quot; and the autonym are listed as accepted.

Several botanical synonyms are listed by POWO for each of the species recognized there.
&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; var. &quot;baccata&quot;:
&quot;Yucca baccata&quot; var. &quot;brevifolia&quot;:
==Distribution and habitat==

The plant is known from the Great Basin, the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts, plus the &quot;Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion&quot; and lower, southern parts of the Rocky Mountains. It occurs primarily in the US states of Utah, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, and the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It can be found in several habitat types including Pinyon-Juniper, desert grassland, Creosote bush scrub, sagebrush, and ponderosa pine colonies at elevations generally between .

It is associated with &quot;Yucca schidigera&quot;, &quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot;, &quot;Yucca arizonica&quot;, &quot;Yucca faxoniana&quot;, &quot;Agave utahensis&quot;, and other &quot;Agave&quot; species. It can be found among &quot;Sclerocactus&quot;, &quot;Pediocactus&quot;, &quot;Navajoa&quot;, and &quot;Toumeya&quot; species.

The plant occurs in a large area of the North American deserts and exhibits much variation across its range. &quot;Yucca baccata&quot; specimens from the higher, mountainous regions of the Rocky Mountains is winterhardy and tolerates extreme conditions.

==Ecology==
It is a larval host to the ursine giant skipper, yucca giant skipper, and various yucca moths (&quot;Proxodus&quot; sp.). After feeding, the skippers pupate in the yucca&#x27;s roots.

==Uses==
The young flower stalks can be cooked and eaten, with the tough outer rind discarded. The fruit can be eaten raw or cooked, in the latter case resembling sweet potato.

The Paiutes dried the fruits for use during the winter. It is still a popular food amongst Mexican Indians. The flowers are often eaten by rural residents.

Ancestral Puebloan peoples used the fibers derived from the leaves to create sandals and cordage, and the root was used as soap, although with less frequency than that of &quot;Yucca elata.&quot;

<doc id="840257" wikidata="Q1033452" url="?curid=840257" title="Cannon House Office Building">
<text>The Cannon House Office Building, often called the &quot;Old House Office Building&quot;, completed in 1908, is the oldest office building of the United States Congress in Washington, D.C. A significant example of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture, it occupies a site south of the United States Capitol bounded by Independence Avenue, First Street, New Jersey Avenue, and C Street S.E. In 1962 the building was named for former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Gurney Cannon.

==History==

The first congressional office buildings were constructed immediately after the turn of the 20th century to relieve overcrowding in the interior of the then century-old United States Capitol. Previously, members who wanted office space had to rent quarters or borrow space in committee rooms. In March 1901, Congress authorized Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark (1822-1902, served 1865-1902), to draw plans for fireproof office buildings for both the House and Senate adjacent north and south to the Capitol grounds. By two years later, in March 1903, the acquisition of land for sites, razing of the private residences and businesses and construction of the buildings were authorized. In April 1904, the prominent New York City architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings was retained. Thomas Hastings (1860-1929), took charge of the southside House Office Building project, while John Carrère (1858-1911), oversaw the construction of an almost identical office building (now named the Russell Senate Office Building) for the United States Senate to the north. Their Beaux Arts / Classical Revival styles of architecture designs were restrained complementary to the original Capitol of 1792-1863.

The Cannon Building was occupied during the session of the 60th U.S. Congress in December 1907. By less than a decade later in 1913, however, the House had already outgrown the available office space, and fifty-one rooms were added to the original structure by raising the roof and constructing a fifth floor (not visible in its exterior view). that is visible only from the enclosed court and otherwise obscured on the building&#x27;s exterior public face. Originally there were 397 offices and fourteen committee rooms in the Cannon Building; the subsequent second 1932 remodeling project resulted in 85 two- or three-room suites, 10 single rooms, and 23 committee rooms. During the late 1960s, the House Beauty Shop, a salon which catered to Congresspersons, their spouses, and employees, was relocated to the Cannon House Office Building from the adjacent smaller and newer Longworth House Office Building of 1930-1933, under the auspices of the House of Representatives Beauty Shop Committee.

===2015 renovations===
In January 2015, a top-to-bottom renovation of the Cannon House Office Building began. Completion is expected to take ten years and cost $752.7 million dollars. Initially, this renovation project will be focused on upgrading the building infrastructure and utilities, but will progress on to a wing-by-wing exterior and interior reconstruction. According to Bill Weidemeyer (Superintendent of the House), the building &quot;is plagued by safety, health, environmental and operational issues that are rapidly worsening. Many of the building’s systems are original from the 1908 construction.&quot;

==Architecture==
Architecturally, the elevations are divided into a rusticated base and a colonnade with an entablature and balustrade. The colonnades with thirty-four Doric columns that face the Capitol are echoed by pilasters on the sides of the building, and very inspired by the Louvre Colonnade in Paris. The Cannon Building is faced with marble and limestone; while the Senate&#x27;s Russell Building&#x27;s base and terrace are gray granite.

Modern for its time, the building initially included such facilities as forced-air ventilation systems, steam heat, individual lavatories with hot and cold running water and ice water, telephones, and electricity. Both the Cannon Building and the Russell Building are connected to the Capitol by underground passages.

Of special architectural interest is the rotunda. Eighteen Corinthian columns support an entablature and a coffered dome, whose glazed oculus floods the rotunda with natural light. Twin marble staircases lead from the rotunda to an imposing Caucus Room, which features Corinthian pilasters, a full entablature, and a richly detailed ceiling.

==Cannon Tunnel==
The north-south Cannon Tunnel connects the Cannon House Office Building to the Capitol. The tunnel is lined with artwork from the annual Congressional Art Competition for high school students. Branching off the entrance to the Cannon Tunnel is a separate tunnel southwest to the adjacent Longworth House Office Building, and entrances to a cafeteria, shoe shiner/cobbler, and a Legislative Resource Center. Unlike the tunnels from the Capitol to the Senate Office Buildings on the northside and the Rayburn Tunnel, the Cannon Tunnel because of its age, has no subway line, and is primarily a pedestrian pathway. In addition, a separate tunnel runs between the Cannon building and to the east of the neighboring James Madison Memorial Building, a part of the adjacent Library of Congress buildings complex.

<doc id="840262" wikidata="Q170098" url="?curid=840262" title="AASI Jetcruzer">
<text>The AASI Jetcruzer was an American single turboprop light civil transport made by Advanced Aerodynamics and Structures Inc. The Jetcruzer had an unusual configuration, with a single turboprop engine driving a pusher propeller, a prominent canard, and fins mounted at the ends of its swept wings. The plane has seating for up to six people including the pilot. The Jetcruzer is noteworthy for being the first aircraft to have achieved a spin resistance certification from the United States FAA.

==Development==

===Jetcruzer 450===
Design work on the Jetcruzer commenced in March 1983, with prototype construction starting in 1988. The aerodynamic design was undertaken in the UK by Sandy Burns from 1984-1985, layout prepared by Ladislao Pazmany, structural design undertaken by David Kent of Light Transport Design in the UK, and the wind tunnel test done by University of San Diego. Prototype construction started in June 1988 and was first exhibited at the NBAA show in October 1988 with a 420 horsepower Rolls-Royce 250-C20S engine. The Allison 250-C20S prototype first flew on January 11, 1989. This initial version, designated the Jetcruzer 450 seated six people (including the pilot). The first flight of the Jetcruzer 450 forerunner was 11 January 1989 (N5369M). Preproduction prototype (N102JC) made its first flight in April 1991 while the first flight on production form (N450JC) was done on September 13 1992. 

It received its Federal Aviation Regulations Part 23 certification on 14 June, 1994, and was intending on receiving a single-engine FAA Part 135 public transport IFR certification Three prototypes were built, but AASI chose not to market this aircraft, in order to focus on more advanced versions. A spin recovery system for use in the flight test program was designed for the aircraft by Butler Parachute Systems which also worked on one for the Sino Swearingen SJ-30.

===Jetcruzer 500===
The first version developed from the 450 was the Jetcruzer 500, a slightly stretched version powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66A featuring cabin pressurization. Two of the model 450 prototypes were converted to this configuration. The prototype Jetcruzer 500 (N102JC) made its first flight on August 22, 1997 with the second prototype (N200JC) making its first flight on 7 November 1997. The first public appearance was at NBAA Las Vegas October 1998. The third prototype (N136JC) of the new build was scheduled to be flown in early 2000. This was the version selected for production, and at one point, AASI had orders for some 200 aircraft at $US 1.6 million each. A military version, the ML-2 had also been offered, as well as a UAV, the ML-1.

None of these orders would be filled, however, as the Jetcruzer 500 remained uncertified and its development slowly stagnated. Specific problems with the aircraft&#x27;s noise, high stall speed, and center of gravity were not overcome before all work on it was suspended in 2002. Nearly 20 years of work had still not resulted in a marketable aircraft.

===Jetcruzer 650===
In December 1992, construction work began on the prototype of an even larger variant, the Jetcruzer 650, which was to seat up to thirteen. This was quickly abandoned as the company&#x27;s financial problems required resources to be focused on the 500. A military version would have been the ML-4.

===Stratocruzer 1250===
Similarly, a turbofan-powered version was planned as the Stratocruzer 1250, but never left the drawing board. Design work had started in September 1991 to provide a business jet with intercontinental range. A military version, the ML-5 intended for surveillance duties, was also planned. Work was abandoned after AASI failed to attract financial backers for the project in 1995.

==Post AASI Era==
In November 2003, AASI (by now, MASG) offered the entire Jetcruzer project for auction, and sold it to Innova Aircraft in February 2004. Shortly after the purchase, Innova announced its intentions of offering a new version of the aircraft in kit form, marketed by a new subsidiary, Jetcruzer LLC. This will feature a modified wing to overcome the problems faced by the Jetcruzer 500, and will be powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D turbofans. It was expected to fly by late 2004 or early 2005, but development ceased before the flight can happen.

In 2017, all the aircraft and intellectual properties were acquired by Jetcruzer International, LLC., based in Ontario, California, and production resumed. All Jetcruzer components and subassemblies including wings, landing gear, fins, control surfaces and fittings are manufactured in the company&#x27;s Ontario facility. The composite fuselage is subcontracted to a composite manufacturing company currently producing advanced composite parts for the transport aerospace industry. A Jetcruzer 500E was restored with new avionics, electrical wirings and a new engine. The first flight of this aircraft is planned in September 2022.

Jetcruzer International on February 18, 2025, announced a firm order for ZeroAvia&#x27;s 600-kilowatt ZA600 electric propulsion system (EPS) to support development of its six-seat hydrogen-electric 500E airplane. According to ZeroAvia, this is the first firm order for the ZA600, which the company has developed to convert aircraft carrying up to 20 passengers to hydrogen power. California-based Jetcruzer plans to take delivery of the ZA600 powertrain in second-quarter 2025 as it works towards service entry in 2028 for the 500E. When the first ZA600 is delivered, it will be integrated with a rebuilt Jetcruzer 500 airframe that will be used as a flying testbed.

<doc id="840264" wikidata="Q157732" url="?curid=840264" title="Anagallis">
<text>Anagallis is a genus of about 20–25 species of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae, commonly called pimpernel. The scarlet pimpernel referred to in literature is part of this genus. The botanical name is from the Greek ( &#x27;again&#x27;) and ( &#x27;to delight in&#x27;), and it refers to the opening and closing of the flowers in response to environmental conditions.

These are annual or perennial plants, growing in tufts on weedy and uncultivated areas. The stems are prostrate or decumbent. The leaves are opposite, rarely whorled, and sometimes with a few alternate leaves at the end of the stem. They are usually ovate in shape with a cordate base. Some of the species produce flowers of various colors. The flowers are radially symmetrical and have 5 sepals. The corolla consists of a short tube and 5 lobes. The tube may be so short that the lobes appear to be separate petals. They are usually solitary in the leaf axils, but sometimes are on short spikes at the end of the stem. Pimpernel flowers remain open only under direct sun-light. The stamens are opposite the corolla lobes. The staminal filaments have conspicuous hairs. The ovary is superior, globose, and near the middle.

They were traditionally classified as members of the primrose family (Primulaceae), but a genetic and morphological study by et al. showed that they belonged to the closely related family Myrsinaceae. In the APG III system, published in 2009, Primulaceae is expanded to include Myrsinaceae, thus &quot;Anagallis&quot; is back in Primulaceae again.

Another study, based on molecular phylogeny, states that &quot;Anagallis&quot; in its present circumscription is paraphyletic and should also include in its clade the small genera &quot;Asterolinon&quot; and &quot;Pelletiera&quot;, as well as two &quot;Lysimachia&quot; species (&quot;Lysimachia nemorum&quot; and &quot;Lysimachia serpyllifolia&quot;).

<text>The Battle of Cape Spartivento, known as the Battle of Cape Teulada in Italy, was a naval battle during the Battle of the Mediterranean in the Second World War, fought between naval forces of the Royal Navy and the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; on 27 November 1940.

==Origins==
On the night of 11 November 1940, the British incapacitated or destroyed half of the Italian fleet&#x27;s battleships in a daring aerial assault as they lay at rest at Taranto. Until then, the Italians had left their capital ships in harbour, hoping its mere presence as a fleet in being would deter British shipping through the area, though they would not decline battle if given the opportunity.

Six days later, on the night of 17 November, an Italian force consisting of two battleships ( and ) and a number of supporting units attempted to intercept two British aircraft carriers, and and their cruiser escorts, who were &quot;en route&quot; to Malta in an attempt to provide planes to reinforce that island&#x27;s defenses (Operation White). The British were warned of their approach and immediately turned about and returned to Gibraltar, launching their aircraft (two Blackburn Skuas and 12 Hawker Hurricanes) prematurely. One Skua and eight Hurricanes were lost at sea, as they ran out of fuel well before arriving at their destination, with the loss of seven airmen.

The Italians&#x27; success in disrupting the reinforcement of Malta cast serious doubt upon British plans to send a further convoy to supply the island (Operation Collar). However, the convoy was attempted, with increased support, including ships from Gibraltar-based Force H, and Force D from Alexandria. The convoy was spotted by the Italian intelligence service, and once again the Italian fleet sailed out to intercept it. The first Italian naval unit to make visual contact with the convoy was the torpedo boat on the night of 26 November. After launching two torpedoes from long range, which missed their target, &quot;Sirio&quot; reported seven enemy warships heading to the east.

==Battle==
The British, aware of the Italian fleet&#x27;s movements, sent their forces north to intercept them before they could come anywhere near the cargo ships. At 09:45 on 27 November, an IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance floatplane from the heavy cruiser &quot;Bolzano&quot; discovered a British squadron steaming to the east, north of Chetaïbi.

Shortly after, at 9:56, Admiral James Somerville received the report of his own aircraft from the carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; about the presence of five cruisers and five destroyers, and assumed that these were Italian units closing for battle. Force D had not yet arrived from Alexandria and the British were outgunned, but 15 minutes later, Force D was spotted and the tables turned. The two forces were fairly even; although the Italian ships possessed both longer-ranged and larger guns, the British had an aircraft carrier, which had shown several advantages over the battleship at Taranto. However, the Italian admiral Inigo Campioni had been given orders to avoid combat unless it was heavily in his favour, so a decisive battle was out of the question.

Admiral Somerville deployed his forces into two main groups, with five cruisers under Rear Admiral Lancelot Holland in front and two battleships and seven destroyers in a second group following to the south. Meanwhile, and even further to the south, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was preparing to launch its complement of Fairey Swordfish. The Italians had organized their fleet into three groups, two composed of the six heavy cruisers and seven of the destroyers and a third group of the two battleships and another seven escorting destroyers bringing up the rear. At 12:07, after a report received from the cruiser ″s floatplane, Campioni realized the closeness in strengths of the two forces and in accordance with his orders commanded the cruiser groups to re-form on the battleships and prepare to depart. However, by this point, the lead cruiser formation had already angled toward the British and was beginning to engage them in battle.

At 12:22, the lead groups of both cruiser forces came into range and opened fire at . Rapid fire between the two forces continued as the distance between them closed, but as the range shortened Italian firepower began to put pressure on the outgunned British. The arrival of the battleship on the British side helped to even the odds, but she was too slow to maintain formation and dropped out of battle after a few salvoes at 12:26. Four minutes later, Vice Admiral Angelo Iachino, commander of the Italian cruiser group, received orders to disengage, although the battle had swung slightly in their favour. Iachino ordered an increase in speed to , laid smoke and started to withdraw.

At this time, the Italian destroyer was hit by a broadside from and seriously damaged, although she was towed to port after the battle. The heavy cruiser was hit at 12:22 by a single 203 mm (8 in) shell, which knocked out her &quot;Y&quot; turret, killed seven men, wounded nine others and ignited a fire that took an hour to subdue. A second hit at 12:35 destroyed the after breaker (electrical switchboard) room and cut power to the ship&#x27;s aft section, including the remaining aft turret. Most sources believe that the first hit was scored by an Italian heavy cruiser from the 1º Cruiser Division, either from &quot;Fiume&quot; or , while the second round came from the 3º Cruiser Division, either from or , at the time the only Italian warships within range.

At around 12:40, eleven Swordfish from Ark Royal attacked &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; with torpedoes, but did not score any hits.

For the next few minutes, the tables turned in favour of the British when the battlecruiser closed the distance on the Italian cruisers, and straddled &quot;Trieste&quot; with two salvoes. The Italian cruiser was hit by splinters. This advantage was soon negated, however, when at 13:00, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; opened fire from . &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; fired 19 rounds in seven salvoes from long range and that was enough for the now outgunned British cruisers, which turned back at the fourth salvo. In fact, as giant water-spouts erupted around &quot;Berwick&quot; and &quot;Manchester&quot;, Holland ordered smoke, and his ships fled southeast to close with &quot;Renown&quot;. &quot;Manchester&quot; was holed by splinters from &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;&#x27;s rounds. Both forces withdrew, the battle lasting a total of 54 minutes and causing little damage to either side.

==Aftermath==
After the battle Winston Churchill wanted Somerville to be replaced, having questioned his offensive spirit ever since his objections to attacking the French at Mers-el-Kebir. A board of inquiry exonerated Somerville, who enjoyed the strong support of several fellow admirals. As for Campioni, although he had a mandate to be conservative, he had presided over the loss of Italy&#x27;s best opportunity to deal the British a sharp setback in a fleet action. His days of command at sea were numbered. As Iachino remarked, &quot;the use of these ships, which constituted at that moment nearly all of our fleet&#x27;s effective units after the blow at Taranto, was decided by Supermarina mainly for reasons of morale, and to demonstrate that our combative spirit remained intact.&quot;

<doc id="840268" wikidata="Q625139" url="?curid=840268" title="Karst Plateau">
<text>The Karst Plateau or the Karst region (, ), also locally called Karst, is a karst plateau region extending across the border of southwestern Slovenia and northeastern Italy.

It lies between the Vipava Valley, the low hills surrounding the valley, the westernmost part of the Brkini Hills, northern Istria, and the Gulf of Trieste. The western edge of the plateau also marks the traditional ethnic border between Italians and Slovenes. The region gave its name to karst topography. For this reason, it is also referred to as the &quot;Classical Karst&quot;.

== Geographical position ==

The plateau rises quite steeply above the neighboring landscape, except for its northeastern side, where the steepness is less pronounced. The plateau gradually descends from the southeast to the southwest. On average it lies 334 m above sea level. Its western edge, known as the Karst Rim (), is a continuation of the Učka mountain range in eastern Istria, and rises to the east and southeast of Trieste, ending in steep cliffs between Aurisina and Duino. Many interesting geological phenomena occur along the Karst Rim, including the picturesque Rosandra Valley (also known as Glinščica).

Because the Karst steeply descends towards the Adriatic Sea, it is less exposed to the beneficial climatological effects of the Mediterranean. In the past, the main vegetation on the plateau was oaks, but these were replaced by pine forests in the 19th and 20th centuries. Forests now cover only one third of the Karst. Starting in the Middle Ages, the plateau suffered radical deforestation for economic reasons. Although it is often said that much of the wood for the closely spaced piles that support the island city of Venice came from this region, this is unlikely. Venice perhaps used the wood for naval timber. The most radical deforestation occurred in the first half of the nineteenth century due to clear-cutting by local farmers and conversion of the land into pastures for goats and sheep.

The Karst is famous for its caves. In Slovenia, they include Vilenica Cave (the oldest show cave in Europe), Lipica Cave, Divača Cave, Kačna Cave, Postojna Cave, and Škocjan Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and Grotta Gigante in Italy (the largest show cave in the world).

Most of the Karst is located in the Slovenian Littoral, covering an area of 429 square kilometres, with a population of about 19,000 people. The Karst as a whole has exactly 100 settlements. The town of Sežana is the center of the region on the Slovene side of the border. The main rural centers are the settlements of Divača, Dutovlje, and Komen. Štanjel is a picturesque clustered settlement at the top of the northern rim of the plateau; its houses are tightly clustered around Turn Hill, giving it the appearance of a medieval town. On the Italian side of the border, important settlements include Opicina, Duino, and Aurisina.

Natural conditions, including the bora () wind, and the local way of life all shaped the elements of Karst architecture, creating simple but well-defined forms. One of the main tourist centers in the area is Lipica, with its stud farm (the home of the Lipizzan horse breed) and other tourist facilities.

== Language, culture and traditions ==
The vast majority of the inhabitants of the Karst Plateau are ethnic Slovenes. Traditionally, only the villages of San Martino del Carso and Poggio-Sdraussina (in the municipality of Sagrado) has been inhabited by Friulian speakers, the villages of Polazzo (in the municipality of Fogliano-Redipuglia), Vermegliano and Selz (in the municipality of Ronchi dei Legionari) by Venetian speakers, and the town of Duino has been inhabited for long by a mixed population, while all the rest of the region was almost entirely Slovene-speaking from the Middle Ages until the end of World War I, after which some thousands Italians moved in the region while it was entirely under Italy&#x27;s sovereignty, and again from the late 1940s and during the 1950s, when Istrian Italians fleeing from Yugoslavia were settled in Karst villages in the Province of Trieste, especially in the municipality of Duino. As a consequence, today an estimated one fifth of the population of the Karst Plateau is Italian speaking, while the rest is mostly Slovene speaking.

The Slovenes in the region speak two closely related Slovene dialects, both belonging to the Littoral dialect group. In the southern part of the plateau (in the municipalities of Divača and Hrpelje-Kozina, and the southern part of the Municipality of Sežana, in the Italian municipality of Monrupino, and in most of the Slovene-speaking areas of the municipality of Trieste), the Inner Carniolan dialect is spoken. In the northern part (the northern part of the Municipality of Sežana, in the Slovenian municipalities of Komen and Miren-Kostanjevica, in the Italian municipalities of Sgonico, Duino-Aurisina and Doberdò del Lago, as well in some eastern suburbs of Trieste, like Barcola), the Karst dialect is spoken.

The Karst is renowned for its strong red wine, known as teran, prosciutto and its traditional cuisine, which is a mixture of Mediterranean and Central European cuisine. The traditionally produced Karst prosciutto, a sort of dry-cured ham, is protected at the European level.

== Prominent natives and residents ==
Prominent persons that were born or lived in this region include the poets Srečko Kosovel, Igo Gruden, Ciril Zlobec, and Branka Jurca, social activist Danilo Dolci, architect Max Fabiani, painters Avgust Černigoj and Lojze Spacal, writers Alojz Rebula, Igor Torkar, and Bogomir Magajna, theologian Anton Mahnič, politicians Drago Marušič, Josip Ferfolja, and Majda Širca, economist Milko Brezigar, and actress Ita Rina. The picturesque Karst landscape inspired numerous artists who were not from this region, including the poets Rainer Maria Rilke, Alojz Gradnik, and Edvard Kocbek, essayists Scipio Slataper and Marjan Rožanc, writers Italo Svevo, Fulvio Tomizza, and Susanna Tamaro, and film director Jan Cvitkovič. Many artists and authors settled in the area, including Josip Osti and Taras Kermauner.

== Geographical extension==
Municipalities that are completely or partially in the Karst include:

*Italy
**Savogna d&#x27;Isonzo () (partially)
**Doberdò del Lago ()
**Sagrado () (partially)
**Fogliano Redipuglia () (partially)
**Ronchi dei Legionari () (partially)
**Monfalcone () (partially)
**Duino-Aurisina ()
**Sgonico ()
**Monrupino ()
**Trieste () (partially)
**San Dorligo della Valle () (partially)
*Slovenia
**Miren-Kostanjevica (partially)
**Komen
**Sežana
**Divača
**Hrpelje-Kozina (partially)

Historically, the region around Pivka, Postojna and Ilirska Bistrica also used to be considered as part of the Karst. This subregional identity is still documented in the late 17th century, but it weakened in the later period, replaced by an Inner Carniolan identity.

<doc id="840271" wikidata="Q9261747" url="?curid=840271" title="New Jerusalem Bible">
<text>The New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) is an English-language translation of the Bible published in 1985 by Darton, Longman and Todd and Les Editions du Cerf, edited by Benedictine biblical scholar Henry Wansbrough, and approved for use in study and personal devotion by members of the Catholic Church and approved also by the Church of England.

== Sources ==
This version of scripture is translated directly from the Hebrew, Greek or Aramaic. The 1973 French translation, the Bible de Jérusalem, is followed only where the text admits to more than one interpretation. The introductions and notes, with some modifications, are taken from the Bible de Jérusalem.

== Overview ==
The New Jerusalem Bible is an update to the Jerusalem Bible, an English version of the French Bible de Jérusalem. It is commonly held that the Jerusalem Bible was not a translation from the French; rather, it was an original translation heavily influenced by the French. This view is not shared by Henry Wansbrough, editor of the New Jerusalem Bible, who writes, &quot;Despite claims to the contrary, it is clear that the Jerusalem Bible was translated from the French, possibly with occasional glances at the Hebrew or Greek, rather than vice versa.&quot;

Like the Jerusalem Bible, the New Jerusalem Bible makes the uncommon decision to render God&#x27;s name, the Tetragrammaton in the Jewish scriptures, as Yahweh rather than as &quot;&quot;, in 6,823 places in the NJB Old Testament. This decision was based on translating or reinstating the earliest known copy of parts of the Old Testament found at Qumran in 1947 (the Dead Sea Scrolls), dating to about the second century BCE. Coincidentally, the Qumran text sometimes agrees with the Septuagint, from about the same period, rather than with the later Masoretic text. For example, in Deuteronomy 32:8–9, not only is &quot;Lord&quot; translated as Yahweh, but a phrase &quot;sons of Israel&quot; is corrected to &quot;sons/children of God&quot; on basis of the Qumran and the Septuagint texts. The NJB is one of the versions authorized to be used in services of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion.

The New Jerusalem Bible also transliterates the Hebrew term &quot;Sabaoth&quot; rather than using the traditional rendering, thus &quot;Yahweh Sabaoth&quot; instead of &quot;Lord of hosts&quot;. This is for the sake of accuracy, as the translation of &quot;Sabaoth&quot; is uncertain.

== Successor to the NJB ==
The French reference for The New Jerusalem Bible, and the source of its study notes, is the French La Bible de Jérusalem, last updated in 1998, a new Bible project is currently operating under the title The Bible in its Traditions. According to the notes, more weight will be given to the Septuagint in the translation of the Hebrew Bible Scriptures, though the Masoretic Text will remain the primary source. The Demonstration Volume (in English, French and Spanish) is available now. The French portion of the Demonstration Volume is available online, together with a single sample of the English translation.

The publisher Darton, Longman and Todd published the Revised New Jerusalem Bible in 2019. The first edition, containing the New Testament and the Psalms, was published in February 2018, and the full Bible in July 2019. Substantially revising the JB and NJB texts, the new translation &quot;applies formal equivalence translation for a more accurate rendering of the original scriptures, sensitivity to readable speech patterns and more inclusive language.&quot; It contains new study notes and book introductions, written by Henry Wansbrough.
