<text>The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), also known as the greater one-horned rhinoceros, great Indian rhinoceros or Indian rhino, is a species of rhinoceros found in the Indian subcontinent. It is the second largest living rhinoceros species, with adult males weighing and adult females . Its thick skin is grey-brown with pinkish skin folds. It has a single horn on its snout that grows up to long. Its upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart-like bumps, and it is nearly hairless aside from the eyelashes, ear fringes and tail brush.

The Indian rhinoceros is native to the Indo-Gangetic Plain and occurs in 12 protected areas in northern India and southern Nepal. It is a grazer, eating mainly grass, but also twigs, leaves, branches, shrubs, flowers, fruits and aquatic plants. It is a largely solitary animal, only associating in the breeding season and when rearing calves. Females give birth to a single calf after a gestation of 15.7 months. The birth interval is 34–51 months. Captive individuals can live up to 47 years. It is susceptible to diseases such as anthrax, and those caused by parasites such as leeches, ticks and nematodes.

The Indian rhinoceros is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as the population is fragmented and restricted to less than . Excessive hunting and agricultural development reduced its range drastically. In the early 1990s, the global population was estimated at between 1,870 and 1,895 individuals. Since then, the population increased due to conservation measures taken by the governments. As of August 2018, it was estimated to comprise 3,588 individuals. However, poaching remains a continuous threat.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Rhinoceros unicornis&quot; was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 who described a rhinoceros with one horn. As type locality, he indicated Africa and India. He described two species in India, the other being &quot;Rhinoceros bicornis&quot;, and stated that the Indian species had two horns, while the African species had only one.

The Indian rhinoceros is a single species. Several specimens were described since the end of the 18th century under different scientific names, which are all considered synonyms of &quot;Rhinoceros unicornis&quot; today:

* &quot;R. indicus&quot; by Cuvier, 1817
* &quot;R. asiaticus&quot; by Blumenbach, 1830
* &quot;R. stenocephalus&quot; by Gray, 1867
* &quot;R. jamrachi&quot; by Sclater, 1876
* &quot;R. bengalensis&quot; by Kourist, 1970

=== Etymology ===
The generic name &quot;rhinoceros&quot; is derived through Latin from the , which is composed of (&quot;rhino-&quot;, &quot;of the nose&quot;) and (&quot;keras&quot;, &quot;horn&quot;) with a horn on the nose. The name has been in use since the 14th century. The Latin word &quot;ūnicornis&quot; means &quot;one-horned&quot;.

=== Evolution ===

Ancestral rhinoceroses first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene. The last common ancestor of living rhinoceroses belonging to the subfamily Rhinocerotinae is suggested to have lived around 16 million years ago, with the ancestors of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; diverging from the ancestors of other living rhinoceroses around 15 million years ago. The genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; has been found to be overall slightly more closely related to the Sumatran rhinoceros (as well as to the extinct woolly rhinoceros and the extinct Eurasian genus &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;) than to living African rhinoceroses, though there appears to have been gene flow between the ancestors of living African rhinoceroses and the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, as well as between the ancestors of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; and the ancestors of the woolly rhinoceros and &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;.

A cladogram showing the relationships of recent and Late Pleistocene rhinoceros species (minus &quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus)&quot; based on whole nuclear genomes, after Liu et al., 2021:

The earliest fossils of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; date to the Late Miocene, around 8–9 million years ago. The divergence between the Indian and Javan rhinoceros is estimated to have occurred around 4.3 million years ago. The earliest representatives of the modern Indian rhinoceros appeared during the Early Pleistocene (2.6-0.8 million years ago). Fossils indicate that the Indian rhinoceros during the Pleistocene also inhabited areas considerably further east of its current distribution, including mainland Southeast Asia, South China and the island of Java, Indonesia.

== Characteristics ==
Indian rhinos have a thick grey-brown skin with pinkish skin folds and one horn on their snout. Their upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart-like bumps. They have very little body hair, aside from eyelashes, ear fringes and tail brush. Bulls have huge neck folds. The skull is heavy with a basal length above and an occiput above . The nasal horn is slightly back-curved with a base of about by that rapidly narrows until a smooth, even stem part begins about above base. In captive animals, the horn is frequently worn down to a thick knob. The Indian rhino&#x27;s single horn is present in both bulls and cows, but not on newborn calves. The horn is pure keratin, like human fingernails, and starts to show after about six years. In most adults, the horn reaches a length of about , but has been recorded up to in length and in weight.

Among terrestrial land mammals native to Asia, Indian rhinos are second in size only to the Asian elephant. They are also the second-largest living rhinoceros, behind only the white rhinoceros. Bulls have a head and body length of with a shoulder height of , while cows have a head and body length of and a shoulder height of . The bull, averaging about is heavier than the cow, at an average of about . The largest individuals reportedly weigh up to .


The rich presence of blood vessels underneath the tissues in folds gives them the pinkish colour. The folds in the skin increase the surface area and help in regulating the body temperature. The thick skin does not protect against bloodsucking &quot;Tabanus&quot; flies, leeches and ticks.

==Distribution and habitat==
Indian rhinos once ranged across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins, from Pakistan to the Indian-Myanmar border, including Bangladesh and the southern parts of Nepal and Bhutan. They may have also occurred in Myanmar, southern China and Indochina. They inhabit the alluvial grasslands of the Terai and the Brahmaputra basin. As a result of habitat destruction and climatic changes its range has gradually been reduced so that by the 19th century, it only survived in the Terai grasslands of southern Nepal, northern Uttar Pradesh, northern Bihar, northern West Bengal, and in the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam.

The species was present in northern Bihar and Oudh at least until 1770 as indicated in maps produced by Colonel Gentil. On the former abundance of the species, Thomas C. Jerdon wrote in 1867:

Today, its range has further shrunk to a few pockets in southern Nepal, northern West Bengal, and the Brahmaputra Valley. Its habitat is surrounded by human-dominated landscapes, so that in many areas, it occurs in cultivated areas, pastures, and secondary forests. In the 1980s, Indian rhinos were frequently seen in the narrow plain area of Manas River and Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan.

=== Populations ===

In 2022, the total Indian rhinoceros population was estimated to be 4,014 individuals, up from 2,577 in 2006. Among them, 3,262 are in India and the remaining 752 are in Nepal and Bhutan. There is no permanent rhino population in Bhutan, but small rhino populations are occasionally known to cross from the Manas National Park or Buxa Tiger Reserve in India.

In India, there are around 2,885 individuals in Assam, including 2,613 in Kaziranga National Park, 125 in Orang National Park, 107 in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and 40 in Manas National Park. West Bengal has a population of 339 individuals, including 287 in Jaldapara National Park and 52 in Gorumara National Park. Only 38 individuals are found in Dudhwa National Park, in Uttar Pradesh.

By 2014, the population in Assam increased to 2,544 Indian rhinos, an increase of 27% since 2006, although more than 150 individuals were killed by poachers during these years.
The population in Kaziranga National Park was estimated at 2,048 individuals in 2009. By 2009, the population in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary had increased to 84 individuals in an area of .

In 2015, Nepal had 645 Indian rhinos living in Parsa National Park, Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park, Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and respective buffer zones in the Terai Arc Landscape as recorded in a survey conducted from 11 April to 2 May 2015. The survey showed that the population of rhinos in Nepal from 2011 to 2015 increased 21% or 111 individuals.

The Indian rhino population, which once numbered as low as 100 individuals in the early 1900s, has increased to more than 3,700 in the year 2021 as per The International Rhino Foundation.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Bulls are usually solitary. Groups consist of cows with calves, or of up to six subadults. Such groups congregate at wallows and grazing areas. They are foremost active in early mornings, late afternoons and at night, but rest during hot days.
They bathe regularly. The folds in their skin trap water and hold it even when they exit wallows. They are excellent swimmers and can run at speeds of up to for short periods. They have excellent senses of hearing and smell, but relatively poor eyesight. Over 10 distinct vocalisations have been recorded. Males have home ranges of around that overlap each other. Dominant males tolerate other males passing through their territories except when they are in mating season, when dangerous fights break out.
Indian rhinos have few natural enemies, except for tigers, which sometimes kill unguarded calves, but adult rhinos are less vulnerable due to their size. Mynahs and egrets both eat invertebrates from the rhino&#x27;s skin and around its feet. &quot;Tabanus&quot; flies, a type of horse-fly, are known to bite rhinos. The rhinos are also vulnerable to diseases spread by parasites such as leeches, ticks, and nematodes like &quot;Bivitellobilharzia nairi&quot;. Anthrax and the blood-disease sepsis are known to occur.
In March 2017, a group of four tigers consisting of an adult male, tigress and two cubs killed a 20-year-old male Indian rhinoceros in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. Such cases are rare, as Indian rhinoceroseslike most megaherbivoresare mostly invulnerable to predation.

=== Diet ===
Indian rhinos are grazers. Their diet consists almost entirely of grasses (such as &quot;Arundo donax&quot;, &quot;Bambusa tulda&quot;, &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;, and &quot;Oryza sativa&quot;), but they also eat leaves, twigs and branches of shrubs and trees (such as &quot;Lagerstroemia indica&quot;), flowers, fruits (such as &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;), and submerged and floating aquatic plants.
They feed in the mornings and evenings. They use their semi-prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs on both sides and using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down to the level of the mouth. Mothers also use this technique to make food edible for their calves. They drink for a minute or two at a time, often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine.
=== Social life ===
Indian rhinos form a variety of social groupings. Bulls are generally solitary, except for mating and fighting. Cows are largely solitary when they are without calves. Mothers will stay close to their calves for up to four years after their birth, sometimes allowing an older calf to continue to accompany her once a newborn calf arrives. Subadult bulls and cows form consistent groupings, as well. Groups of two or three young bulls often form on the edge of the home ranges of dominant bulls, presumably for protection in numbers. Young cows are slightly less social than the bulls. Indian rhinos also form short-term groupings, particularly at forest wallows during the monsoon season and in grasslands during March and April. Groups of up to 10 rhinos, typically a dominant male with females and calves, gather in wallows.

Indian rhinos make a wide variety of vocalisations. At least 10 distinct vocalisations have been identified: snorting, honking, bleating, roaring, squeak-panting, moo-grunting, shrieking, groaning, rumbling and humphing. In addition to noises, the Indian rhino uses olfactory communication. Adult bulls urinate backwards, as far as behind them, often in response to being disturbed by observers. Like all rhinos, the Indian rhinoceros often defecates near other large dung piles. The Indian rhino has pedal scent glands which are used to mark their presence at these rhino latrines. Bulls have been observed walking with their heads to the ground as if sniffing, presumably following the scent of cows.

In aggregations, Indian rhinos are often friendly. They will often greet each other by waving or bobbing their heads, mounting flanks, nuzzling noses, or licking. Indian rhinos will playfully spar, run around, and play with twigs in their mouths. Adult bulls are the primary instigators in fights. Fights between dominant bulls are the most common cause of rhino mortality, and bulls are also very aggressive toward cows during courtship. Bulls chase cows over long distances and even attack them face-to-face. Indian rhinos use their horns for fighting, albeit less frequently than African rhinos, largely using the incisors of the lower jaw to inflict wounds.


=== Reproduction ===
Captive bulls breed at five years of age, but wild bulls attain dominance much later when they are larger. In one five-year field study, only one Indian rhino estimated to be younger than 15 years mated successfully. Captive cows breed as young as four years of age, but in the wild, they usually start breeding only when six years old, which likely indicates they need to be large enough to avoid being killed by aggressive bulls. The ovarian cycle lasts 5.5 to 9 weeks on average. Their gestation period is around 15.7 months, and birth interval ranges from 34 to 51 months. An estimated 10% of calves will die before maturity. This is mainly attributed to predatory attacks from tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;). In captivity, four Indian rhinos lived over 40 years, the oldest living to be 47.
== Threats ==

Habitat degradation caused by human activities and climate change as well as the resulting increase in the floods has caused many Indian rhino deaths and has limited their ranging areas which is shrinking.

Serious declines in quality of habitat have occurred in some areas, due to severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations, and demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels (swampy wetlands). Grazing by domestic livestock is another cause.

The Indian rhino species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. Any catastrophic event such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, or habitat loss would have a devastating impact on the Indian rhino&#x27;s status. Additionally, a small population of rhinos may be prone to inbreeding depression.

=== Poaching ===
Sport hunting became common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was the main cause for the decline of Indian rhinoceros populations. Indian rhinos were hunted relentlessly and persistently. Reports from the mid-19th century claim that some British military officers shot more than 200 rhinos in Assam alone. By 1908, the population in Kaziranga National Park had decreased to around 12 individuals. In the early 1900s, the Indian rhinoceros was almost extinct. At present, poaching for the use of horn in traditional Chinese Medicine is one of the main threats that has led to decreases in several important populations. Poaching for the Indian rhino&#x27;s horn became the single most important reason for the decline of the Indian rhinoceros after conservation measures were put in place from the beginning of the 20th century, when legal hunting ended. From 1980 to 1993, 692 rhinos were poached in India, including 41 rhinos in India&#x27;s Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary in 1983, almost the entire population of the sanctuary. By the mid-1990s, the Indian rhinoceros had been extirpated in this sanctuary. Between 2000 and 2006, more than 150 rhinos were poached in Assam. Almost 100 rhinos were poached in India between 2013 and 2018.

In 1950, in Nepal the Chitwan&#x27;s forest and grasslands extended over more than and were home to about 800 rhinos. When poor farmers from the mid-hills moved to the Chitwan Valley in search of arable land, the area was subsequently opened for settlement, and poaching of wildlife became rampant. The Chitwan population has repeatedly been jeopardised by poaching; in 2002 alone, poachers killed 37 animals to saw off and sell their valuable horns.

== Conservation ==
The Indian rhinoceros is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red list, as of 2018. Globally, &quot;R. unicornis&quot; has been listed in CITES Appendix I since 1975. The Indian and Nepalese governments have taken major steps towards Indian rhinoceros conservation, especially with the help of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and other non-governmental organisations. In 1910, all rhino hunting in India became prohibited.

In 1957, the country&#x27;s first conservation law ensured the protection of rhinos and their habitat. In 1959, Edward Pritchard Gee undertook a survey of the Chitwan Valley, and recommended the creation of a protected area north of the Rapti River and of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of 10 years. After his subsequent survey of Chitwan in 1963, he recommended extension of the sanctuary to the south. By the end of the 1960s, only 95 rhinos remained in the Chitwan Valley. The dramatic decline of the rhino population and the extent of poaching prompted the government to institute the &quot;Gaida Gasti&quot; – a rhino reconnaissance patrol of 130 armed men and a network of guard posts all over Chitwan. To prevent the extinction of rhinos, the Chitwan National Park was gazetted in December 1970, with borders delineated the following year and established in 1973, initially encompassing an area of . To ensure the survival of rhinos in case of epidemics, animals were translocated annually from Chitwan to Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta National Park since 1986.
The Indian rhinoceros population living in Chitwan and Parsa National Parks was estimated at 608 mature individuals in 2015.

=== Reintroduction to new areas ===
Indian rhinos have been reintroduced to areas where they had previously inhabited but became extinct. These efforts have produced mixed results, mainly due to lack of proper planning and management, sustained effort, and adequate security for the introduced animals.

In 1984, five Indian rhinos were relocated to Dudhwa National Park—four from the fields outside the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and one from Goalpara. This has born results and the population has increased to 21 rhinos by 2006. In early 1980s, Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam had more than 70 Indian rhinos which were all killed by poachers. In 2016, two Indian rhinos, a mother and her daughter, were reintroduced to the sanctuary from Kaziranga National Park as part of the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) program, but both animals died within months due to natural causes.

Indian rhinos were once found as far west as the Peshawar Valley during the reign of Mughal Emperor Babur, but are now extinct in Pakistan. After rhinos became &quot;regionally extinct&quot; in Pakistan, two rhinos from Nepal were introduced in 1983 to Lal Suhanra National Park, which have not bred so far.

=== In captivity ===

Indian rhinoceroses were initially difficult to breed in captivity. In the second half of the 20th century, zoos became adept at breeding Indian rhinoceros. By 1983, nearly 40 babies had been born in captivity. As of 2012, 33 Indian rhinos were born at Switzerland&#x27;s Zoo Basel alone, meaning that most captive animals are related to the Basel population. Due to the success of Zoo Basel&#x27;s breeding program, the International Studbook for the species has been kept there since 1972. Since 1990, the Indian rhino European Endangered Species Programme is also being coordinated there, with the goal of maintaining genetic diversity in the global captive Indian rhinoceros population.

The first recorded captive birth of an Indian rhinoceros was in Kathmandu in 1826, but another successful birth did not occur for nearly 100 years. In 1925, a rhino was born in Kolkata. No rhinoceros was successfully bred in Europe until 1956 when first European breeding took place when baby rhino Rudra was born in Zoo Basel on 14 September 1956. In June 2009, an Indian rhino was artificially inseminated using sperm collected four years previously and cryopreserved at the Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s CryoBioBank before being thawed and used. She gave birth to a male calf in October 2010. In June 2014, the first &quot;successful&quot; live-birth from an artificially inseminated rhino took place at the Buffalo Zoo in New York. As in Cincinnati, cryopreserved sperm was used to produce the female calf, Monica.

== Cultural significance ==

The Indian rhinoceros is one of the motifs on the Pashupati seal and many terracotta figurines that were excavated at archaeological sites of the Indus Valley civilisation.

The Rhinoceros Sutra is an early text in the Buddhist tradition and is part of the Gandhāran Buddhist texts and the Pali Canon; a version was also incorporated into the Sanskrit Mahavastu. It praises the solitary lifestyle and stoicism of the Indian rhinoceros and is associated with the eremitic lifestyle symbolized by the Pratyekabuddha.

=== Europe ===

In the 3rd century, Philip the Arab exhibited an Indian rhinoceros in Rome. In 1515, Manuel I of Portugal obtained an Indian rhinoceros as a gift, which he passed on to Pope Leo X, but which died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516, on the way from Lisbon to Rome. Three artistic representations were prepared of this rhinoceros: A woodcut by Hans Burgkmair, a drawing and a woodcut called &quot;Dürer&#x27;s Rhinoceros&quot; by Albrecht Dürer, all dated 1515. In 1577–1588, Abada was a female Indian rhinoceros kept by the Portuguese kings Sebastian I and Henry I from 1577 to 1580 and by Philip II of Spain from about 1580 to 1588. She was the first rhinoceros seen in Europe after &quot;Dürer&#x27;s Rhinoceros&quot;. In about 1684, the first presumably Indian rhinoceros arrived in England. George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys spread the rumour that his chief rival Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford had been seen riding on it.

In 1741–1758, &quot;Clara the rhinoceros&quot; (c. 1738 – 14 April 1758) was a female Indian rhinoceros who became famous during 17 years of touring Europe in the mid-18th century. She arrived in Europe in Rotterdam in 1741, becoming the fifth living rhinoceros to be seen in Europe in modern times since Dürer&#x27;s rhinoceros in 1515. After tours through towns in the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Empire, Switzerland, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, France, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Papal States, Bohemia and Denmark, she died in Lambeth, England. In 1739, she was drawn and engraved by two English artists. She was then brought to Amsterdam, where Jan Wandelaar made two engravings that were published in 1747. In the subsequent years, the rhinoceros was exhibited in several European cities. In 1748, Johann Elias Ridinger made an etching of her in Augsburg, and Petrus Camper modelled her in clay in Leiden. In 1749, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon drew it in Paris. In 1751, Pietro Longhi painted her in Venice.

<text>Brooks Brothers is an American high-end clothing brand, founded in 1818. It is the oldest apparel brand in continuous operation in the United States. Originally a family business, it is currently owned as a joint venture between Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group.
Brooks Brothers produces clothing for men, women and children, and licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear, Interparfums for fragrances, and Turko Textiles for its home collection.

==History==

=== Founding and 19th century ===
On April 7, 1818, at the age of 45, Henry Sands Brooks opened H. &amp; D. H. Brooks &amp; Co. on the northeast corner of Catherine St and Cherry St in Manhattan. He proclaimed that his guiding principle was, &quot;To make and deal only in merchandise of the finest body, to sell it at a fair profit, and to deal with people who seek and appreciate such merchandise.&quot; In 1833, his four sons, Elisha, Daniel, Edward, and John, inherited the family business and in 1850 renamed the company &quot;Brooks Brothers.&quot;

The Golden Fleece symbol was adopted as the company&#x27;s trademark in 1850. A wooly sheep suspended in a ribbon had long been a symbol of British woolen merchants. Dating from the fifteenth century, the image had been the emblem of the Knights of the Golden Fleece, founded by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.
In its early history, Brooks Brothers was known for introducing the ready-to-wear suit to American customers. In the mid-nineteenth century, Brooks Brothers outfitted United States President Abraham Lincoln and considered him a loyal customer. At his second inauguration, Lincoln wore a coat specially crafted for him by Brooks Brothers. Hand-stitched into the coat&#x27;s lining was a design featuring an eagle and the inscription, &quot;One Country, One Destiny&quot;. He was wearing the coat and a Brooks Brothers suit when he was assassinated. As a supplier of soldiers&#x27; uniforms during the Civil War, Brooks Brothers became a target of outrage for its allegedly shoddy production. With a contract from New York State to supply uniforms for the New York Volunteers, Brooks Brothers took shredded and sometimes decaying rags, glued them together and stitched them into uniforms. They would fall apart in the rain and were the subject of ridicule from other regiments.
 According to James Murray (primary editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; from 1879 until his death in 1915) Brook Brothers were allegedly responsible for bringing &quot;shoddy&quot; into American usage. 

=== 20th century ===
The last member of the Brooks family to head the company was Winthrop Holly Brooks, who ran the company from 1935 until its sale in 1946, when the company was acquired by Julius Garfinckel &amp; Co. Although Winthrop Brooks remained with the company as a figurehead after the acquisition, John C. Wood became the director of Brooks Brothers. Just prior to that, Wood had been the carrier of the papers for the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. Under the leadership of Wood, Brooks Brothers became even more traditional. Wood notably stated &quot;They call us conservative, but we think that our styles are simply lacking the bizarre. We deal in what a man should wear, not what some women think he should wear.&quot; In 1915 the company opened what would become its flagship store and headquarters at 346 Madison Avenue in New York.

During much of the 20th Century, a subsidiary of Brooks Brothers, the Brooks Costume Company, provided costumes to the Ringling Bros - Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

By 1971, eleven Brooks Brothers stores were in operation and located in Manhattan, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis as an integral part of the retail conglomerate Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller &amp; Rhoads, Inc., that held the company until 1981 when it was acquired by Allied Stores.

Ralph Lauren began his career as a salesman at the Brooks Brothers Madison Avenue store. Brooks Brothers later sued Polo Ralph Lauren to retain its rights to the original polo button-down collar shirt.

Brooks Brothers was acquired by the British firm Marks &amp; Spencer in 1988. In the mid 1990s, the company&#x27;s executives removed the signature Golden Fleece logo from the brand&#x27;s cotton knit polo shirts, though it was later restored.

In 1998, Brooks Brothers launched its official website.

===21st century===
In 2001, Marks &amp; Spencer sold Brooks Brothers to Retail Brand Alliance (RBA), now known as The Brooks Brothers Group, a company privately owned by Italian billionaire Claudio del Vecchio (son of Luxottica founder Leonardo del Vecchio). Along with Brooks Brothers, RBA comprised Carolee, a designer of jewelry for department stores and specialty stores. In 2007, RBA sold its high-end women&#x27;s brand Adrienne Vittadini.

In September 2007, Brooks Brothers&#x27;s then CEO, Claudio Del Vecchio, announced the unveiling of a high-end collection of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wear named Black Fleece. Del Vecchio announced that the first star guest designer for the new collection would be New York menswear designer Thom Browne. Black Fleece received so much critical and commercial success that Brooks Brothers opened a stand-alone Black Fleece boutique on Bleecker Street in the Winter of 2008. However the line used a confusing sizing range (such as size &quot;BB 0&quot;) and was discontinued in 2015. Brooks Brothers next released a line of clothing catering to Asian clientele.
In 2008, the company began an extensive renovation of its flagship store at 346 Madison Avenue. In January 2009, Brooks Brothers closed a smaller location at Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan. 

In April 2010, Brooks Brothers launched a line of luxury home furnishings which includes bedding, bath towels, as well as living room décor and entertaining accessories.

As of 2015, there were 210 Brooks Brothers stores in the United States and 70 in other countries, including Australia, India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Chile, Canada, Panama, Italy, the Philippines, Poland, Mexico, UAE, Peru, Singapore, Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Greece, and Vietnam. Most of its clothing was imported, but some suits, sport coats, shirts and accessories were manufactured in the United States. Many of its mid-range &quot;1818&quot; line of suits were manufactured at Brooks Brothers&#x27; Southwick plant in Haverhill, Massachusetts. All Brooks Brothers necktie silk was woven in England or Italy, and the ties were still are &quot;cut and piled&quot; at the Brooks Brothers&#x27; tie factory in Long Island City, New York. Brooks also had a series of books on etiquette and manners for ladies and gentlemen. The Garland Shirt Company produced the Brooks Brothers&#x27; iconic twill button-down oxford. Its higher-end label was the Golden Fleece line which features suits that are tailored in the United States.

Between 2017 and 2019, sales stagnated at around $1 billion due to business fashion turning more casual and online competition. In May 2020, it was reported that Brooks Brothers was seeking a buyer. Reports also suggest the company was exploring a bankruptcy filing. In June, the company proposed closing its three American factories, &quot;a dramatic move for a brand that has really hung their hat on &#x27;Made in America.&#x27;&quot; Del Vecchio, who was responsible for acquiring the factory in Massachusetts, said at the time that the U.S. factories never made any money and that the brand carried a debt of less than $300 million.

On July 8, 2020, it was reported the company was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy primarily due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brooks Brothers planned to close 51 of its 250 locations in North America. The closures included the flagship Madison Avenue store which never reopened. Its inventory was moved to other locations and the building was listed for sale the following year.

In September 2020 Brooks Brothers was purchased by a joint venture between Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group. The new owners committed to continue operating at least 125 Brooks Brothers retail locations in the US, and more worldwide (down from 424 global locations before the COVID-19 pandemic). The transaction was completed in September 2020. Ken Ohashi was also appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2020.

On December 1, 2020, designer Michael Bastian was named as the brand&#x27;s creative director. In late 2023 a new affordable line was introduced, &quot;B by Brooks Brothers&quot;, and sold through Macys.

On 24 April 2024, Ted Baker Canada, the operator of Brooks Brothers stores in Canada, filed for creditor protection in Canada and Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S. The company blamed the operation suppliers of Authentic Brands Group for failing to pay. As a result, it was announced that all Brooks Brothers stores in Canada would close. 

==Innovations==
Brooks Brothers introduced many clothing advances to the American market throughout its history as a leader in the American menswear industry.
* Brooks Brothers largely created the ready-to-wear clothing market, beginning in 1849.
* In 1896, John E. Brooks, the grandson of Henry Sands Brooks, applied button-down collars to dress shirts after having seen them on English polo players.
* English foulard ties were introduced by Francis G. Lloyd in the 1890s before he was made president of the corporation.
* The American &quot;sack suit&quot;, which became a staple of the Ivy League style, was introduced by Brooks Brothers in 1895.
* Brooks Brothers popularized pink as a color for men&#x27;s dress shirts, suggesting it be worn with charcoal-gray suits.
* Shetland sweater, introduced in 1904
* Harris Tweed, introduced to the fashion marketplace in 1909
* Polo coat about 1910
* Madras, introduced from India via Brooks Brothers to the public in 1902
* Argyles socks: in 1957, Brooks Brothers became the first American retailer to manufacture the article for men
* Light-weight summer suits: the first lightweight summer suits made of cotton corduroy and seersucker were introduced by Brooks during the early 1930s
* Wash-and-wear shirts: in 1953, the store pioneered the manufacture of wash-and-wear shirts using a blend of Dacron, polyester, and cotton that was invented by Ruth R. Benerito, which they called &quot;Brooksweave&quot;
* Non-iron 100% cotton dress shirt, 1998

Brooks Brothers did not make an off-the-rack black suit between 1865 and 2003. For many years, a myth circulated that the reason the company did not make black suits was out of deference to Abraham Lincoln, who wore a bespoke black Brooks frock coat, a gift from the company, when he was assassinated. It is not clear if this policy was the result or cause of the traditional American fashion rule that black suits in daytime for men are proper only for servants and when honoring the deceased.

<text>A madrigale spirituale (Italian; pl. &quot;madrigali spirituali&quot;) is a madrigal, or madrigal-like piece of music, with a sacred rather than a secular text. Most examples of the form date from the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, and principally come from Italy and Germany.

&quot;Madrigali spirituali&quot; were almost always intended for an audience of cultivated, often aristocratic amateurs. They were performed at private houses, academies, and courts of noblemen in Italy and adjacent countries, but almost certainly were not used liturgically. The &quot;madrigale spirituale&quot; was an a cappella form, though instrumental accompaniment was used on occasion, especially after 1600.

During the Counter-Reformation, there was, to some degree, a reaction against the secularization of the art of music in Italy, Spain and the southern (Catholic) portion of Germany. While that did not stop the composition of secular music (indeed, the explosion of forms and styles of secular music continued unabated), many composers began to adapt the most advanced secular compositional forms to religious usage. On occasion, existing madrigals were merely fitted with a religious text, usually in Latin, without any other change (such adaptations are called &quot;contrafacta&quot;). However, some of the madrigali spirituali reached heights of expressive and emotional intensity at least equal to that of the finest madrigalists in their secular compositions.

The form was probably encouraged by the Jesuits; some collections were dedicated to them, especially in the 1570s and 1580s.

Some famous examples of &quot;madrigali spirituali&quot; include Lassus&#x27;s sublimely beautiful &quot;Lagrime di San Pietro&quot; (Munich, 1595); Guillaume Dufay&#x27;s &quot;Vergine bella&quot;, (ca. 1470) setting a poem in praise of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Petrarch; Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina&#x27;s &quot;First Book of Madrigals&quot; (1581), also setting Marian poems by Petrarch; Carlo Gesualdo&#x27;s &quot;Tenebrae Responsories&quot; (1611); and the huge collection by Giovanni Francesco Anerio, &quot;Teatro armonico spirituale&quot; (Rome, 1619).

<text>Branicki Palace () is a historical edifice in Białystok, Poland. It was developed on the site of an earlier building in the first half of the 18th century by Jan Klemens Branicki, a wealthy Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth hetman, into a residence suitable for a man whose ambition was to become king of Poland. The palace complex with gardens, pavilions, sculptures, outbuildings and other structures and the city with churches, city hall and monastery, all built almost at the same time according to French models was the reason why the city was known in the 18th century as &quot;Versailles de la Pologne&quot; (Versailles of Poland) and subsequently &quot;Versailles de la Podlachie&quot; (Versailles of Podlasie).

==History==
The Palace was built for Count Jan Klemens Branicki, Great Crown Hetman and patron of art and science, raised in the French milieu of the Polish aristocracy, who transformed a previous house into the suitably magnificent residence of a great Polish noble, a rival to Wilanów Palace, making a start in 1726. He also laid out the central part of the town of Bialystok, not a large place in the 18th century, with its triangular market.
The original wooden manor of the Raczkowicz family that occupied the site was transformed in the 16th century into a brick two-storey castle for Piotr Wiesiołowski the Younger. The architect was Hiob Bretfus, who constructed the a gothic-renaissance structure with a moat and earth ramparts. 

Shortly after the property was inherited by Stefan Mikołaj Branicki he commissioned the transformation of the castle into a baroque mansion. The structure was thoroughly reconstructed during 1691–1697 by Tylman Gamerski, including one of the towers adapted to a staircase. During the subsequent reconstruction, the side outbuildings were enhanced, the Ionic colonnade above the main entrance was erected and the whole structure was adorned with sculptures. Further expansion of the palace was conducted by Jan Klemens Branicki and his wife Izabella Poniatowska. Starting in 1728 the reconstruction of the palace was directed by Johann Sigmund Deybel. Under his supervision, the structure was enhanced, the tympanum and domes on the towers were added. Deybel is also the author of the main façade. The existing pavilions and outbuildings were merged with the main building (&quot;corps de logis&quot;) according to French model to form wings surrounding a horseshoe court - the courtyard of honour (&quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;), which was closed with a gate built in 1758 by Jan Henryk Klemm. 

Among notable architects employed in reconstruction was Pierre Ricaud de Tirregaille. After the death of Deybel, in the years 1750–1771, the rebuilding of the palace was supervised by Jakub Fontana, who was an author of the palace&#x27;s vestibule, rococo interiors and the staircase with statues by Jan Chrysostom Redler (1754). The fence between the initial (&quot;avant cour&quot;) and honor courtyard was adorned in 1757 with two monumental sculptures by Redler - &quot;Hercules fighting the dragon&quot; and &quot;Hercules fighting the hydra&quot;. Interior decorations were conducted by artists such as Szymon Czechowicz, Ludwik Marteau, Augustyn Mirys, Jean-Baptiste Pillement, fresco painters such as Georg Wilhelm Neunhertz (in 1738) and Antoni Herliczka and stucco decorators Samuel Contesse and Antoni Vogt.
The newly created &quot;Versailles de la Pologne&quot; concentrated many great artists, poets including Elżbieta Drużbacka and Franciszek Karpiński and scientists. A theater, orchestra and ballet were established. Among notable guests were King Augustus II the Strong (1726 to 1727 and again in 1729), King Augustus III and his wife and sons Prince Francis Xavier and Prince Charles (1744 and 1752), Prince Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland (twice in 1759), Bishop Ignacy Krasicki (1760), King Stanisław August Poniatowski (occasionally), Emperor Joseph II Habsburg (1780), Grand Duke Paul, future Tsar Paul I of Russia, with his wife (1782), King Louis XVIII of France (1798), French, English, Turkish and Russian envoys and Italian actress.

With the third Partition of Poland it went to the Prussian Kingdom and, after 1807, to Russia. 

Before 1830, a significant part of the palace&#x27;s furnishings was destroyed or taken away. After Izabela&#x27;s death, the Potockis took most of the paintings and furniture, among others, to Choroszcz and their estates in Russia. They were completely destroyed. Part of the palace&#x27;s furnishings were purchased by Tsar Alexander I, and some, including the garden sculptures, were taken to Saint Petersburg, where they decorated the Tsar&#x27;s residences. The palace underwent occasional alterations and repairs. It almost lost its former significance. In 1837, the Institute of Noble Maidens was located here. In 1884, for the needs of the institute, styleless buildings were added to the palace. They irreversibly destroyed the former Baroque structure of the residence. After the Institute was evacuated to Moscow following the withdrawal of the Russians from the city, the Germans set up a military hospital in the palace in 1916. This led to further devastation. In 1919 following the city&#x27;s inclusion in the newly established Second Polish Republic, the Polish military authorities had their seat there.

In the summer of 1920, briefly, the palace was the headquarters of the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee. Branicki Palace suffered from bombing and fires caused by the Germans, with damage totaling approximately 70%. It was restored after World War II as a matter of national pride. 

In the same year, following the end of the Soviet-Bolshevik War and the return of the city to Polish hands, a decision was made to designate the palace as the seat of the Białystok Voivodeship Office. The rooms on the ground floor were designated as the governor&#x27;s apartment. Other rooms in the palace housed offices. In the room on the first floor, which was created as a result of the reconstruction in 1879, ceremonies, balls, receptions and exhibitions were organized. In 1939, after the Germans occupied Białystok, representatives of the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, which treacherously entered Polish territory on September 17, signed documents sanctioning the fall of Poland in the palace. In 1941-1944, the German National Planning Office and the Office of the Civil Commissioner were located here.

Following the joining of Białystok to Poland and the establishment of communist rule, in 1946 the Main Directorate of Museums and Monument Protection commissioned engineer Stanisław Bukowski to develop a project for the reconstruction and adaptation of the monument to the Palace of Folk Culture in the main building and the Regional Museum in one of the side wings. Based on the comments of the then General Conservator of Monuments, Prof. Jan Zachowatowicz, and on the basis of his own research and that of Dr. Jan Glinka, Bukowski prepared a technical project for the reconstruction of the palace in the years 1947-1949. At the same time, he was appointed to the position of the main director of the reconstruction. The main conservation assumption of the project was to rebuild the palace and restore the monument&#x27;s external appearance, together with the architectural decoration from the mid-18th century.

At the end of 1949, the decision regarding its purpose was changed and the first university in the history of Białystok - the Medical Academy - was located there. Andrzej Nitch who replaced Bukowski as chief architect of those efforts, created the project of adaptation for the purposes of the Medical Academy, developed in 1950. It introduced a number of changes despite Bukowski&#x27;s reservations. However, in 1951 Bukowski he was once again appointed to the position of architectural director of the palace reconstruction on behalf of the Medical Academy. By 1955, the complex of buildings had been almost completely rebuilt and adapted to the needs of the university. In the 1950s, the project of revalorization of the palace garden complex was also started. The designs for the historic park were prepared by prof. Gerard Ciołek, and Bukowski for the park pavilions, terrace, fountains and bridge. Bukowski supervised as late as the 70s the execution of the polychromes in the main hall and the staircase of the palace.

== The palace grounds ==
A straight avenue centred on the palace passes across the river on a three-arched bridge across the river, which is confined with deep stone embankment walling, to the large enclosed paved forecourt. The central block has two storeys upon a high arcaded basement storey, with a pedimented central block displaying Branicki&#x27;s coat-of-arms and end pavilions that have squared domes in two tiers. The roofline is an Italianate balustrade that masks a low attic storey, and the heroic sculptural group of Atlas crowning all.

Surrounding the Palace are the grounds. The garden front has a terrace raised on columns, which forms a podium for viewing the parterre in the French taste with a main central allée and French sphinxes, and a later English landscape garden, in the naturalistic taste associated with the English park, surrounding the grounds. The central axis continues to a guest pavilion. Other outbuildings include the Arsenal (1755), Orangery and Italian and Tuscan Pavilions.

<doc id="802156" wikidata="Q4935415" url="?curid=802156" title="Bobby Newmark">
<text>Bobby Newmark is one of the main characters in the William Gibson novel &quot;Count Zero&quot;. His handle in the Matrix is &quot;Count Zero&quot;, from which the novel derives its name. Newmark is one of several Gibson characters who live through information.

== Fictional character biography ==
At the beginning of &quot;Count Zero&quot;, Bobby Newmark lives in his mother&#x27;s condominium in Barrytown, New Jersey. Bobby is a hotdogger, a neophyte hacker with aspirations of becoming a big-time cowboy in the worldwide cyberspace construct, the Matrix. He acquires an ICE breaker, software designed to defeat security systems, from a friend, unaware that it is actually a stolen experimental corporate model and that he is its unwitting test dummy. His test run ends in disaster, nearly costing him his life (&quot;pulling a wilson&quot;, in hotdogger slang). At the last moment Bobby is rescued by the apparition of a girl, which releases him from the grasp of the ICE destroying his nervous system. This episode leads Bobby to leave home. Seeking the friend who lent him the software, Bobby becomes acquainted with Beauvoir and Lucas, two Matrix cowboys who learned of his salvation at the hands of the mysterious girl, whom they refer to as the Virgin. Lucas takes Bobby to the Sprawl, where he becomes entangled in a dispute between his new chaperons and the massive zaibatsu, Hosaka. With Bobby&#x27;s help, the situation is eventually defused, and he is introduced to Angela Mitchell, the girl being sought after by Hosaka, and the mysterious Virgin who saved Bobby&#x27;s life. Until this point, Angela has been in the care of the mercenary Turner, the protagonist of one of the book&#x27;s other concurrent storylines. The two eventually become lovers.

In the third Sprawl novel, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, Bobby, now eight years older, plays a less central role: he is comatose and jacked into a large gray box called an aleph, which is actually an unfathomably massive data storage device which contains a virtual reality approximation of the entire world. It is here that Bobby now makes his home. Throughout the book, it is shown that Bobby and Angela have been separated for an extended period because Bobby had mysteriously disappeared. At the end of the book, they are reunited, and Angela joins Bobby inside the aleph.

== Literary analysis ==
Bobby Newmark has been described as one of the &quot;most fully developed of Gibson&#x27;s characters&quot;.

<text>Nigel Sinclair, CBE (born 31 March 1948) is a Scottish producer of Hollywood films.

== Early life ==

Sinclair was born in Corbridge, Northumberland, England. His family moved to Galloway, in southwest Scotland, a few years later where he grew up. He went to boarding school at Monkton Combe School in England. In 1966, he attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating in 1969. After a short stint working as a researcher for the Department of Criminology, University of Cambridge, he qualified as a lawyer with the London firm then known as Denton, Hall and Burgin. He practiced law in London and subsequently in the Middle East until 1980. In 1979/1980, Sinclair attended Columbia University School of Law in New York and obtained a LAM in International Legal Studies, and qualified for the State Bar of California. In 1989, Sinclair founded his own firm, Sinclair Tennenbaum &amp; Co., in Los Angeles. He practiced entertainment law until he retired from that practice in 1996 to found Intermedia with Guy East.

== Film career ==

In 2014, Sinclair founded documentary, television and film company White Horse Pictures alongside East with partners Nicholas Ferrall, Cassidy Hartmann and Jeanne Elfant Festa. With White Horse Pictures, Sinclair has produced a series acclaimed documentaries, including Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Beatles: Eight Days A Week - The Touring Years&quot; and &quot;Pavarotti&quot;, &quot;The Apollo&quot; (exec) directed by Roger Ross Williams, &quot;The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; directed by Frank Marshall, and Amy Poehler&#x27;s documentary directorial debut &quot;Lucy and Des&quot;i.

Prior to launching White Horse Pictures, Sinclair was the CEO and co-chairman of Exclusive Media, a global independent film company that financed, produced and globally distributed feature films and documentaries. With Exclusive, Sinclair produced &quot;Parkland&quot;, starring Zac Efron, Billy Bob Thornton and Paul Giamatti; &quot;Snitch&quot;, starring Dwayne Johnson; and &quot;End of Watch&quot;, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Peña, Anna Kendrick and America Ferrera.

In addition, Sinclair was executive producer on Ron Howard&#x27;s epic action-thriller &quot;Rush&quot;, set in the spectacular world of Formula 1 auto racing. Along with Michael Shevloff and Paul Crowder, Sinclair also produced the documentary &quot;1&quot;, the authorized history of Formula 1.

At White Horse, Sinclair&#x27;s latest productions include a feature adaptation of Conn Iggulden&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; series about Julius Caesar&#x27;s early years and a biopic about The Who drummer Keith Moon. The latter of the two projects will be produced with Exclusive.

Previously, Sinclair served as executive producer on George Clooney&#x27;s &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and the Academy Award-winning documentary feature &quot;Undefeated&quot;, produced by Exclusive Media&#x27;s documentary production arm Spitfire Pictures. Sinclair also served as an executive producer on the Hammer Films production and box-office hit &quot;The Woman in Black&quot;, starring Daniel Radcliffe.

Sinclair&#x27;s other film credits include Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Way Back&quot;, starring Jim Sturgess and Ed Harris; &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, starring Gwyneth Paltrow; &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger; and Alan Parker&#x27;s &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;, starring Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet.

Prior to co-founding Exclusive Media, Sinclair and Guy East (who is also co-chairman of White Horse Pictures), founded Intermedia Films in 1996, which grew to become one of the world&#x27;s leading independent film companies. After their departure in 2002, Sinclair and East then founded Spitfire Pictures, which was merged with Hammer to form Exclusive Media in 2008.

Under the Spitfire Pictures label Sinclair produced (along with Olivia Harrison) the award-winning &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot;, Martin Scorsese&#x27;s biographical film about the life of George Harrison, which won an Emmy. He also produced the Bob Dylan documentary &quot;No Direction Home&quot;, also directed by Scorsese, which won an Emmy, two Grammy Awards, a Peabody Award and a DuPont.

In 2012, Sinclair won his second Grammy for &quot;Foo Fighters: Back and Forth&quot; and in 2007 he was nominated for a Grammy for &quot;Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who&quot;. Sinclair won his first Grammy in 2006 for &quot;No Direction Home&quot;.

His company Spitfire Pictures had been involved with Tongal since 2013, working with the company to crowd-source a documentary. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Tongal users will submit pitch ideas, with Spitfire selecting the top five, and awarding one the winning idea before distributing the final project.

== Personal life ==

In 1981, Sinclair married Pat Craig and together they have one child in addition to Pat&#x27;s two children. Sinclair now has four grandchildren.

Sinclair is active in a number of charities including the Santa Monica-based charity k9 Connection.

<doc id="802166" wikidata="Q1470315" url="?curid=802166" title="Front organization">
<text>A front organization is any entity set up by and controlled by another organization, such as intelligence agencies, organized crime groups, terrorist organizations, secret societies, banned organizations, religious or political groups, advocacy groups, or corporations. Front organizations can act for the parent group without the actions being attributed to the parent group, thereby allowing them to hide certain activities from the authorities or the public.

Front organizations that appear to be independent voluntary associations or charitable organizations are called front groups. In the business world, front organizations such as front companies or shell corporations are used to shield the parent company from legal liability. In international relations, a puppet state is a state which acts as a front (or surrogate) for another state.

==Intelligence agencies==

Intelligence agencies use front organizations to provide &quot;cover&quot;, plausible occupations and means of income, for their covert agents. These may include legitimate organizations, such as charity, religious or journalism organizations; or &quot;brass plate firms&quot; which exist solely to provide a plausible background story, occupation, and means of income.

Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates was a front company set up in 1994 by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a cover for its officers.

The airline Air America, an outgrowth of Civil Air Transport of the 1940s, and Southern Air Transport, ostensibly a civilian air charter company, were operated and wholly owned by the CIA, supposedly to provide humanitarian aid, but flew many combat support missions and supplied covert operations in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Other CIA-funded front groups have been used to spread American propaganda and influence during the Cold War, particularly in the Third World.
When intelligence agencies work through legitimate organizations, it can cause problems and increased risk for the workers of those organizations. To prevent this, the CIA has had a 20-year policy (since 1976, per US Government sources) of not using Peace Corps members or US journalists for intelligence purposes.

Another airline allegedly involved in intelligence operations was Russian Aeroflot that worked in a close coordination with KGB, SVR and GRU. The company conducted forcible &quot;evacuations&quot; of Soviet citizens from foreign countries back to the USSR. People whose loyalty was questioned were drugged and delivered unconscious by Aeroflot planes, assisted by the company KGB personnel, according to former GRU officer Victor Suvorov. In the 1980s and 1990s, specimens of deadly bacteria and viruses stolen from Western laboratories were delivered by Aeroflot to support the Russian program of biological weapons. This delivery channel encoded VOLNA (&quot;wave&quot;) meant &quot;delivering the material via an international flight of the Aeroflot airline in the pilots&#x27; cabin, where one of the pilots was a KGB officer&quot;. At least two SVR agents died, presumably from the transported pathogens.

When businessman Nikolai Glushkov was appointed as a top manager of Aeroflot in 1996, he found that the airline company worked as a &quot;cash cow to support international spying operations&quot; according to Alex Goldfarb: 3,000 people out of the total workforce of 14,000 in Aeroflot were FSB, SVR, or GRU officers. All proceeds from ticket sales were distributed to 352 foreign bank accounts that could not be controlled by the Aeroflot administration. Glushkov closed all these accounts and channeled the money to an accounting center called Andava in Switzerland. He also sent a bill and wrote a letter to SVR director Yevgeni Primakov and FSB director Mikhail Barsukov asking them to pay salaries of their intelligence officers in Aeroflot in 1996. Glushkov was imprisoned in 2000 on charges of illegally channeling money through Andava. Since 2004 the company is controlled by Viktor Ivanov, a high-ranking FSB official who is a close associate of Vladimir Putin.

==Law enforcement==

The FBI has acknowledged using at least thirteen front companies to conceal their use of aircraft to observe criminal activity in the United States, including:

* KQM Aviation
* NBR Aviation
* NG Research
* PXW Services
* FVX Research

==Organized crime==

Many organized crime operations have substantial legitimate businesses, such as licensed gambling houses, building construction companies, hair salons and karaoke bars, engineering firms, restaurants and bars, billiard clubs, trash hauling services, or dock loading enterprises. These front companies enable these criminal organizations to launder their income from illegal activities. As well, the front companies provide plausible cover for illegal activities such as illegal gambling, extortion, drug trafficking, smuggling, and prostitution. Tattoo parlors are often used as fronts for outlaw motorcycle clubs.

Where brothels are illegal, criminal organizations set up front companies providing services such as a &quot;massage parlor&quot; or &quot;sauna&quot; to the point that &quot;massage parlor&quot; or &quot;sauna&quot; is thought as a synonym of brothel in these countries.

===Examples===
A Colombian drug cartel, the Cali Cartel, in the past used Drogas La Rebaja, now a large national pharmacy store chain, as a front company in order to launder their drug trafficking earnings.

The General Manager of the Pharaoh&#x27;s Gentlemen&#x27;s Club in Cheektowaga, New York, is the international leader of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club: John Ermin. Many Outlaws MC members also work at the club. Authorities have referred to Pharaoh&#x27;s as a hot spot for drug dealing and sex trafficking. The club&#x27;s owner is Peter G. Gerace Jr., the nephew of reputed Buffalo crime family boss Joseph A. Todaro Jr. The Outlaws Motorcycle Club, themselves, have been designated by federal law enforcement as a criminal enterprise.

In the early 2000s, the Black Mafia Family established the Atlanta-based record label BMF Entertainment as a front company to launder funds that were generated from the sale of cocaine.

The boxing management company MTK Global is owned by the reputed Irish gang boss Daniel Kinahan. Heredia Boxing Management alleges that MTK Global was established as a front company to launder funds made from drug trafficking.

During the year of 2019, ACT Police shut down the Lakeside Tattoo Parlour in Belconnen on the grounds of it being allegedly used to launder cash for the notorious outlaw motorcycle gang, Comanchero Motorcycle Club. The money laundered through the tattoo parlor allegedly came from the club&#x27;s drug trafficking operations.

==Religion==

===Scientology===

The Church of Scientology uses front groups either to promote its interests in politics, to make its group seem more legitimate, and to recruit. The FBI&#x27;s July 8, 1977 raids on the Church&#x27;s offices (following discovery of the Church&#x27;s Operation Snow White) turned up, among other documents, an undated memo entitled &quot;PR General Categories of Data Needing Coding&quot;. This memo listed what it called &quot;Secret PR Front Groups,&quot; which included the group APRL, &quot;Alliance for the Preservation of Religious Liberty&quot; (later renamed &quot;Americans Preserving Religious Liberty&quot;). The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) is considered by many to now be a front group for the Church of Scientology, which took the group over financially after bankrupting it in a series of lawsuits.

&quot;Time&quot; identified several other fronts for Scientology, including: the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), The Way to Happiness Foundation, Applied Scholastics, the Concerned Businessmen&#x27;s Association of America, and HealthMed Clinic. Seven years later the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; showed how Narconon and World Literacy Crusade were also fronts for Scientology.
Other Scientology groups include Downtown Medical, Criminon and the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE).

==Politics==
In politics, a group may be called a front organization if it is perceived to be disingenuous in its control or goals or if it attempts to mask extremist views within a supposedly more moderate group. Some special interest groups engage in astroturfing, an attempt to mask lobbying as a grassroots movement.

===Apartheid government fronts===
South Africa&#x27;s apartheid-era government used numerous front organizations to influence world opinion and to undertake extra-judicial activities and the killing of anti-apartheid activists; these included the following:
*&quot;The Citizen&quot; – funded secretly by the government and was intended to challenge the liberal &quot;Rand Daily Mail&quot;, contributing to the political ruin of John Vorster and Connie Mulder
*Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) – a covert, special forces organization that harassed, seriously injured, and eliminated anti-apartheid activists
*Federal Independent Democratic Alliance (FIDA) – a conservative black group.
*International Freedom Foundation – Washington-based mechanism to combat sanctions and support Jonas Savimbi and UNITA
*Jeugkrag – or Youth for South Africa, led by Marthinus van Schalkwyk as a short-lived Afrikaner youth group, surreptitiously funded by the Military Intelligence&#x27;s Project Essay
*National Student Federation (NSF) – led by Russell Crystal, intended to challenge NUSAS
*Roodeplaat Research Laboratories – Led by Daan Goosen, the main research facility of Project Coast
*Taussig Familienstiftung, or Taussig Family Trust - a Liechtenstein conduit for secret government transactions
*Veterans for Victory – consisting of national servicemen, a countermeasure to the End Conscription Campaign, which was allied to the United Democratic Front (UDF)

===Communist fronts===

Communist parties (especially Marxist-Leninist ones) have sometimes used front organizations to attract support from those (sometimes called &quot;fellow travellers&quot;) who do not fully agree with the party&#x27;s ideology but agree with certain aspects of it. The front organization often obscures its provenance and may often be a tool for recruitment. Other Marxists often describe front organizations as opportunist. The concept of a front organization should be distinguished from the united front (a coalition of working class or socialist parties) and the popular front. Both the united front and the popular front usually disclose the groups that make up their coalitions.

====United States====
According to a list prepared in 1955 by the United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, the Comintern set up no less than 82 front organizations in the United States in the 1930s and the 1940s.

Soviet intelligence infiltrated many peace movements in the West. In addition to the World Peace Council, important communist front organizations included the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students. Richard Felix Staar has also suggested that these organizations were somewhat less important front organizations: Afro-Asian People&#x27;s Solidarity Organisation, Christian Peace Conference, International Association of Democratic Lawyers, International Federation of Resistance Movements, International Institute for Peace, International Organization of Journalists, Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation, and World Federation of Scientific Workers. There were also numerous smaller organizations, affiliated with the above fronts such as Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. Numerous peace conferences, congresses and festivals have been staged with support of those organizations.

More recently, the Workers&#x27; World Party (WWP) set up an anti-war front group, International ANSWER. (ANSWER is no longer closely associated with WWP; it is closely associated with a WWP splinter, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, but PSL plays a more open role in the organization.) Similarly, Unite Against Fascism, the Anti-Nazi League, the Stop the War Coalition and Respect – The Unity Coalition are all criticised as being fronts for the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (UK).

In 2014, Andrew Cuomo established a front political party, the Women&#x27;s Equality Party. The party was established to take advantage of electoral fusion laws in New York State that allow candidates to run on multiple ballot lines and to count all of their votes together. Critics of the party and of Cuomo have noted that there is an inherent level of deception involved in the party, as Cuomo is not a woman, the party has not favored women in its endorsement policies, and Cuomo&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign fund is the primary source of revenue for the party&#x27;s operations.

====Russia====
In April 1991, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union leadership and the KGB created a puppet political party in Russia, the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union (LDPSU), which became the second officially-registered party in the country. According to KGB General Philipp Bobkov, it was a &quot;Zubatov&#x27;s pseudo-party under KGB control that directs interests and sentiments of certain social groups&quot;. The former Soviet Politburo member Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev described in his book how KGB Director Vladimir Kryuchkov presented the project of the puppet party at a joint meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him about a selection of party leaders and the mechanism of funding from Communist Party money. The book includes an official copy of a document providing the initial Liberal Democratic Party funding (3 million rubles) from the Communist Party&#x27;s money. The Liberal Democratic leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, proved to be an effective media performer and gained 8% of votes during the 1991 presidential elections. He also supported the August 1991 coup attempt.

====China====
The united front is a political strategy and network of groups and key individuals that are influenced or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and used to advance its interests. It has traditionally been a popular front that has included eight legally-permitted political parties: the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and other people&#x27;s organizations. Under Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, the united front and its targets of influence have expanded in size and scope. The united front is managed primarily by but is not limited to the United Front Work Department (UFWD).

====Other====
An anti-Islamist feminist group in the Muslim world has also been accused of being a front organization. The Organization of Women&#x27;s Freedom in Iraq has been accused of being a front for the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq.

==Banned paramilitary organizations==
Banned paramilitary organizations sometimes use front groups to achieve a public face with which to raise funds, negotiate with opposition parties, recruit, and spread propaganda. For example, banned paramilitary organizations often have an affiliated political party that operates more openly, but those parties themselves often end up being banned. The parties may or may not be front organizations in the narrow sense (they have varying degrees of autonomy, and the relationships are usually something of an open secret) but are widely considered to be so, especially by their political opponents.

Examples are the relationship between the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin in 1980s Ireland or between the Basque groups ETA (paramilitary) and Batasuna (party) in Spain. Similarly, in the United States, when the Communist Party USA was highly stigmatized, it often operated largely through front groups. In addition, the Provisional IRA also operated a vigilante front group, Direct Action Against Drugs.

Both Loyalist and Republican paramilitaries in Ireland during the Troubles used cover names when they carried out sectarian attacks against civilians. Republican groups like the Provisional IRA and the Irish National Liberation Army used front names like the South Armagh Republican Action Force, Catholic Reaction Force and the People&#x27;s Republican Army to claim responsibility for attacks on civilians, Loyalists like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defense Association used various front names such as the Protestant Action Force, Ulster Freedom Fighters and Red Hand Defenders when they carried out attacks against civilians, most of which were aimed at Catholic civilians.

During the Weimar Republic in Germany, the anti-Semitic and nationalist Organisation Consul reportedly had a front company named the Bavarian Wood Products Company.

==Corporate front organizations==

Corporations from a wide variety of different industries, such as food, pharmaceutical and energy, set up front groups to advocate on their behalf.

Some pharmaceutical companies set up &quot;patients&#x27; groups&quot; as front organizations that pressure healthcare providers and legislators to adopt their products. For example, Biogen set up a campaign called &quot;Action for Access&quot;, which also claimed it was an independent organization and the voice of multiple sclerosis sufferers. People who visited the website and signed up for the campaign did not realise that these were not genuinely independent patient groups.

Over the past 15 years, increasing concerns about obesity have caused Coca-Cola to experience pressure from social movement activists to reduce the sugar content in its drinks. Although Coca-Cola has publicly promoted consumer engagement in healthy lifestyles with its campaigns such as &#x27;Coming Together&#x27;, activists have also exposed that Coca-Cola has secretly funded front groups or organizations that criticize social movement activists and legitimize controversial corporate activities. The Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) and Global Energy Balance Network (GEBN) are two main groups that engage activists on behalf of Coca-Cola even though they were not intended to be publicly associated with Coca-Cola as a corporation. Research has revealed that the CCF, with a mission to &quot;promote responsibility and protect consumer choices&quot;, uses both verbal and visual strategies to articulate obesity as &quot;personal responsibility&quot; to protect the industry from corporate responsibility.

Tobacco companies frequently use front organizations and doctors to advocate their arguments about tobacco use although less openly and obviously than in the 1980s. The World Health Organization has charged that the tobacco industry funded seemingly-unbiased scientific organizations to undermine tobacco control measures and cited the International Life Sciences Institute in particular. Another way to combat public health measures against tobacco is to use lobbying and campaign contributions. For example, RJ Reynolds, the current second-largest tobacco company in the United States, created a front group named Get Government Off Our Back (&quot;GGOOB&quot;) in 1994 to fight federal regulation of tobacco. By hiding its involvement with tobacco industry, GGOOB avoided the tobacco industry reputation for misrepresenting evidence and drew big supports from both public and legislative aspects, successfully resolving the threats from wide-reaching tobacco regulations.

A list of some alleged corporate front groups active in the US is maintained by the Multinational Monitor. Some think tanks are corporate front groups. These organizations present themselves as research organizations, using phrases such as &quot;...Institute for Research&quot; in their names. Because their names suggest neutrality, they can present the commercial strategies of the corporations which sponsor them in a way which appears to be objective sociological or economical research rather than political lobbying.

Similarly the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness has been criticised as a front organization for various industry bodies which seek to undermine regulation of their environmentally damaging activities under the guise of &#x27;regulatory effectiveness&#x27;.

===Astroturfing===

&quot;Astroturfing&quot;, a wordplay based on &quot;grassroots&quot; efforts, is an American term used pejoratively to describe formal public relations projects which try to create the impression of a groundswell of spontaneous popular response to a politician, product, service, or event. Corporations have been known to &quot;astroturf&quot;, but are not the only entities alleged to have done so. In recent years, organizations of plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys have established front groups such as Victims and Families United to oppose tort reform.

<doc id="802190" wikidata="Q633130" url="?curid=802190" title="Bushing (isolator)">
<text>A bushing or rubber bushing is a type of vibration isolator. It provides an interface between two parts, damping the energy transmitted through the bushing. A common application is in vehicle suspension systems, where a bushing made of rubber (or, more often, synthetic rubber or polyurethane) separates the faces of two metal objects while allowing a certain amount of movement. This movement allows the suspension parts to move freely, for example, when traveling over a large bump, while minimizing transmission of noise and small vibrations through to the chassis of the vehicle. A rubber bushing may also be described as a flexible mounting or antivibration mounting.

These bushings often take the form of an annular cylinder of flexible material inside a metallic casing or outer tube. They might also feature an internal &quot;crush tube&quot; which protects the bushing from being crushed by the fixings which hold it onto a threaded spigot. Many different types of bushing designs exist. An important difference compared with plain bearings is that the relative motion between the two connected parts is accommodated by strain in the rubber, rather than by shear or friction at the interface. Some rubber bushings, such as the D block for a sway bar, do allow sliding at the interface between one part and the rubber.

==History==
Charles E. Sorensen credits Walter Chrysler as being a leader in encouraging the adoption of rubber vibration-isolating mounts. In his memoir (1956), he says that, on March 10, 1932, Chrysler called at Ford headquarters to show off a new Plymouth model.
:&quot;The most radical feature of his car was the novel suspension of its six-cylinder engine so as to cut down vibration. The engine was supported on three points and rested on rubber mounts. Noise and vibration were much less. There was still a lot of movement of the engine when idling, but under a load it settled down. Although it was a great success in the Plymouth, Henry Ford did not like it. For no given reason, he just didn&#x27;t like it, and that was that. I told Walter that I felt it was a step in the right direction, that it would smooth out all noises and would adapt itself to axles and springs and steering-gear mounts, which would stop the transfer of road noises into the body. Today rubber mounts are used on all cars. They are also found on electric-motor mounts, in refrigerators, radios, television sets—wherever mechanical noises are apparent, rubber is used to eliminate them. We can thank Walter Chrysler for a quieter way of life. Mr. Ford could have installed this new mount at once in the V-8, but he missed the value of it. Later Edsel and I persuaded him. Rubber mounts are now found also in doors, hinges, windshields, fenders, spring hangers, shackles, and lamps—all with the idea of eliminating squeaks and rattles.&quot;

Lee Iacocca credits Chrysler&#x27;s chief of engineering during that era, Frederick Zeder, with leading the effort. Iacocca said that Zeder &quot;was the first man to figure out how to get the vibrations out of cars. His solution? He mounted their engines on a rubber base.&quot;

== In Vehicles ==

A bushing is a type of bearing that is used in the suspension system of a vehicle. It is typically used to connect moving parts such as control arms and sway bars to the frame of the vehicle, and also to isolate these parts from each other and from the frame. The main function of a bushing is to reduce the transmission of vibrations and shocks from the road to the rest of the vehicle, which helps to improve the overall ride comfort and reduce noise and harshness inside the vehicle.

<text>Here for the Party is the debut studio album by American country music singer Gretchen Wilson. It was released on May 11, 2004, through Epic Records Nashville. After singing in a bar, she met John Rich of Big &amp; Rich, who invited her to work with him. She would later join the MuzikMafia, a collection of Nashville singers and songwriters that gathered weekly to play songs. Wilson recorded the album in Nashville, Tennessee. The album was produced by Joe Scaife, Mark Wright, and John Rich.

Upon its release, &quot;Here for the Party&quot; received positive reviews from music critics with Wilson being compared to country artist Loretta Lynn. The album itself became a massive success, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 227,000 copies, breaking the record for the highest first sales week from a debut album by a country artist. On the Top Country Albums chart, the album broke records and became the third most successful album of 2004 on the latter chart. Internationally the album became a surprise moderate success, peaking within the top ten in Sweden while entering the album charts in Australia, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

Four single were released in total from the album. The lead and Wilson&#x27;s debut single &quot;Redneck Woman&quot; became a massive success, spending five weeks atop the US Hot Country Songs chart. The follow-up singles &quot;Here for the Party&quot;, &quot;When I Think About Cheatin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Homewrecker&quot; were also successful, all peaking within the top five of the country charts as well.

At the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005, Wilson received four nominations: Best New Artist, Best Country Album, Best Country Song for &quot;Redneck Woman&quot; and Best Female Country Vocal Performance also for &quot;Redneck Woman&quot;, with Wilson winning the latter award. As of 2023, &quot;Here for the Party&quot; is certified 5× Platinum by the RIAA for sales of five million copies sold in the United States alone.

Gretchen Wilson was singing in a bar when she met John Rich of Big &amp; Rich, who invited her to work with him. After some persistence, she agreed and joined the MuzikMafia, an informal group of Nashville singers and songwriters that gathered weekly to play songs.

Wilson signed with Epic Records in 2003 and went in the studio with producers Mark Wright and Joe Scaife and Rich as co-producer. The first single, &quot;Redneck Woman,&quot; was written as a tribute to women from small-town America.

==Reception==

&quot;Redneck Woman&quot; was released as a single in early 2004 and reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts and number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was released in the U.S. on May 11, 2004. It debuted at the top of the country album charts and at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 227,000 copies sold. &quot;Here for the Party&quot; was the fifth best selling album of 2004, with about 2.9 million copies sold.

<doc id="802202" wikidata="Q171510" url="?curid=802202" title="Banda Sea">
<text>The Banda Sea (, , ) is one of four seas that surround the Maluku Islands of Indonesia, connected to the Pacific Ocean, but surrounded by hundreds of islands, including Timor, as well as the Halmahera and Ceram Seas. It is about 1000 km (600 mi) east to west, and about 500 km (300 mi) north to south.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Banda Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:

&quot;On the North&quot; The Southern limits of the Molukka Sea and the Western and Southern limits of the Ceram Sea.
&quot;On the East.&quot; From Tg Borang, the Northern point of Noehoe Tjoet [Kai Besar], through this island to its Southern point, thence a line to the Northeast point of Fordata, through this island and across to the Northeast point of Larat, Tanimbar Islands (), down the East coast of Jamdena [Yamdena] Island to its Southern point, thence through Anggarmasa to the North point of Selaroe and through this island to Tg Aro Oesoe its Southern point ().

&quot;On the South.&quot; A line from Tanjong Aro Oesoe, through Sermata to Tanjong Njadora the Southeast point of Lakov [Lakor, &quot;sic&quot;] () along the South coasts of Lakov [Lakor], Moa and Leti Islands to Tanjong Toet Pateh, the West point of Leti, thence a line to Tanjong Sewirawa the Eastern extremity of Timor and along the North coast as far as longitude 125° East.

&quot;On the West.&quot; From a point on the North coast of Timor in 125° East up this meridian to Alor Island, thence round the East point and along the North coasts of the Alor, Pantar, Lomblen and Adoenara Islands and thence across the Northern end of Flores Strait to Tanjong Serbete the Eastern extreme of Flores, thence a line from its Northern point () to Kalaotoa Island () and through the chain of islands lying between it and the South point of Pulo Salayar, through this island and across the Strait to Tanjong Lassa, Celebes (), thence along the Southern limit of the Gulf of Boni and up the East coast of Celebes to Tanjong Botok ().

==Geography==
Islands bordering the Banda Sea include Sulawesi to the west, Buru, Ambon, Seram to the north, the Aru Islands, Tanimbar Islands, and Kai Islands to the east, and the Barat Daya Islands and Timor to the south. Although the borders of the sea are hazardous to navigation, with many small rocky islands, the middle of the sea is relatively open. Island groups within the sea include the Banda Islands. Some islands in the Banda Sea are active volcanoes including Gunung Api and Manuk in the Banda Islands.

==Geology==
===Plate tectonic activities in Banda Sea===

The Banda arc is famous for its 180° curvature and is, in Timor, generally agreed to be the product of a collision between a volcanic arc and the Australian continental margin. The Banda Sea occupies the main portion of the Banda Sea plate. The southern margin of the sea consists of island arcs above subduction zones. To the east of the Sunda Trench is the Timor Trough which lies south of Timor, the Tanimbar Trough south of the Tanimbar Islands and the Aru Trough east of the Aru Islands. These trenches are the subduction zone of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Banda Sea plate, where the Indo-Australian plate moves northwards. Fore-arc sediments progressively carried northwards by the Indo-Australian plate have been folded and faulted forming Timor island. To the northeast lies Seram Island which overlies the subduction of the Bird&#x27;s Head plate of West Papua. The deepest point of the sea, Weber Deep, is an exposed oceanic fault and the world&#x27;s deepest forearc basin, with depth more than .

===Earthquakes===

Earthquakes are very frequent in the area, due to the confluence of three tectonic plates – Eurasian, Pacific and Indo-Australian plates.
*1852 Banda Sea earthquake
*1938 Banda Sea earthquake
*2006 Banda Sea earthquake

==Ecology==
The Banda Sea is a marine ecoregion, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund. It is part of the Coral Triangle region, which has the greatest diversity of coral reef species in the broader Indo-Pacific.

The islands surrounding the Banda Sea are part of Wallacea, a biogeographical region that contains the islands lying between Asia and Australia which haven&#x27;t been joined to either continent. The islands of Wallacea are home to a mix of plant and animal species from both tropical Asia (the Indomalayan realm) and the Australasian realm which includes Australia and New Guinea.

The islands are divided among several terrestrial ecoregions. The northern islands of Sulawesi, Buru, and Seram constitute separate tropical moist forest ecoregions. The islands south of the Banda Sea are among the driest in Indonesia, and are home to tropical dry forests. The Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion includes Timor and Wetar. The Lesser Sunda Islands from Alor through Flores and Sumbawa to Lombok constitute the Lesser Sundas deciduous forests ecoregion.

The Tanimbar Islands, Kai Islands, and Barat Daya Islands (except for Wetar) in the southeastern Banda Sea form the Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. These islands are covered in mostly-intact rain forest, and home to a number of endemic plants and animals including twenty-one bird species, a very high number for this small ecoregion. There are only twenty-two native mammals on these islands, including the rare dusky pademelon &quot;(Thylogale brunii)&quot; and Indonesian tomb bat (&quot;Taphozous achates&quot;), and the endangered endemic Kei myotis bat &quot;(Myotis stalkeri)&quot;. The birdlife is threatened by egg collectors and even more by cats and rodents that have been introduced to the islands. Yamdena in the Tanimbar Islands is an example of a large and fairly unspoilt habitat and is a protected area. The base for visiting these islands is by plane or ship from Ambon Island to the north. The Banda and Kai Islands, although remote, are visited by tourists for snorkelling and for their unspoilt beaches. Various cetacean species have been recorded including either or both blue and pygmy blue whales and Omura&#x27;s whales.

<text>Mustafa Barzani (; 14 March 1903 – 1 March 1979), also known as Mullah Mustafa (مەلا مستەفا; Mela Mistefa), was a Kurdish nationalist leader and one of the most prominent political figures in modern Kurdish politics. 

In 1946, he was chosen as the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to lead the Kurdish revolt against the Kingdom of Iraq. Barzani was the primary political and military leader of the Kurdish separatist movement until his death in March 1979. He led campaigns of armed insurgency against both the Iraqi and Iranian governments.

==Early life==
Mustafa Barzani was born in 1903 in Barzan, a village in southern Kurdistan. Following an insurrection launched by his tribe, he and his family were imprisoned, when Barzani was only three years old. His father, grandfather, and a brother were later executed by the Ottoman authorities for other insurrections. At an early age he was sent by his older brother Sheikh Ahmed Barzani to join with about twenty men the revolt of Kurdish chiefs of Az Zibar against the British in Iraq. About a hundred fighters managed to ambush the British diplomat J.H.H. Bill and his company and the group was divided into two. Bill was killed with three others, while two local Kurdish tribesmen were spared. After the revolt resulted in a raid on Akre, the contingent of Barzani returned to their homeland. The British did not let such an attack on their authority unpunished and destroyed the houses of the Zibari chiefs as well as the ones from the Barzanis.

In 1931 he followed his older brother, the Barzani chieftain (&quot;sheikh&quot;) Ahmed Barzani, who led an insurrection against Baghdad&#x27;s attempts to break up tribal power in the Kurdish regions of Iraq. The insurrection began when Sheikh Ahmed had entered into a feud with a neighboring tribal chieftain in Baradost after the latter attacked Sheikh Ahmed for heresy, prompting Iraq to intervene as they had intended to check the Barzani tribe before then. Iraq received help from its British allies, who engaged in aerial warfare against territories in rebellion. The aerial bombardments led to widespread damage and setbacks, leading Sheikh Ahmed to surrender to Turkish forces on the then-contested border with Turkey in June 1932, while Mustafa Barzani and a brother Muhammad Sadiq continued fighting for another year. On the advice of Sheikh Ahmed, Mustafa Barzani surrendered to Iraq. But in 1939 he was involved in the formation of the political party &quot;Hewa&quot; (Hope), the first Kurdish political party in Iraq.

Mustafa Barzani was kept under surveillance until 1943, when he again broke free from his exile in Sulaymaniyah as Iraq underwent the effects of World War II. Baghdad again utilized tribal rivalries to defeat Barzani, sending him, Sheikh Ahmad, and about three thousand followers fleeing across the border to Iran, entering Oshnavieh in October 1945, where Kurdish nationalists under the guidance of the Soviet Union were establishing a new Kurdish state. Despite differences between Qazi Muhammad and Mustafa Barzani, the arrival of Barzani&#x27;s forces gave a boost to the ability of the nationalists to assert control over the region.

== Early political career ==

=== Republic of Kurdistan in Mahabad ===
In December 1945 the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad was declared by Qazi Muhammad, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran in Mahabad (northwestern Iran) which was under Soviet military control. Barzani was appointed as the Minister of Defense and commander of the Kurdish army in the Republic of Kurdistan. As Iranian forces began to engage the forces of the Republic of Mahabad, Barzani quickly proved his reputation as a capable commander with his forces inflicting defeats on the Iranian divisions, and was one of the few who did not surrender or defect to the advancing Iranian forces. 

In May 1946 the Soviet troops were withdrawn from Iran and all support for the Republic of Kurdistan was cut, in accordance with the Yalta Agreement. In December of that year Mahabad was finally overrun by Iranian troops, which was followed with harsh punishments for those involved; the president of the Republic Qazi Muhammad was hanged in public in the &quot;Çwar Çira&quot; square in Mahabad city along with his brother and a cousin, and a number of libraries containing Kurdish texts were burned.

=== Exile in the Soviet Union ===
Barzani and his followers arrived in the Armenian SSR and were put in a camp near Nakhchevan. After appealing to the Soviet Union to help them, Barzani and his followers were transferred to the Azerbaijani SSR, kept in camps near and around Baku. Barzani met with Azerbaijan Communist Party officials, who under orders from Moscow were told to help the Kurds.

In November 1947, Barzani met for the first time Mir Jafar Baghirov, the First Secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, to discuss what the Kurds could do in the Soviet Union. Barzani&#x27;s followers were organized into a military regiment and received training in military tactics and politics, as well as education to learn to read and write Kurdish.On 19 January 1948, a conference was held gathering Kurds from Iraq and Iran in Baku, where Barzani outlined a plan for the Kurdish movement. This prompted Iran to again demand that the Soviet Union extradite Barzani and his followers to Iran to stand trial, which the Soviet Union rejected. Barzani however fast ran into problems with Baghirov due to differences and stances towards the Kurdish movement. As Baghirov was connected to Lavrentiy Beria, this gave Baghriov a lot of power in regional affairs, leading to Barzani requesting his followers be transferred out of Azerbaijan fearing Baghirov would act against them.

Barzani and the others were transferred to the Uzbek SSR in August 1948, but Baghriov&#x27;s disputes with Barzani were not forgotten. Despite assurances from both the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan Usman Yusupov, Baghirov&#x27;s rivalry with Barzani spilled over into Uzbekistan and resulted in Barzani himself and much of his followers to be separate and spread across the country to do hard labor. For the following three years, Barzani was separated from his followers, prompting them to engage in sit-ins and strikes demanding they be reunited and their cause recognized.

Barzani sent numerous letters to Moscow, addressing them to Joseph Stalin himself, requesting that he and his followers be treated better and reunited. Only one of these letters reached the Kremlin and shortly afterwards in March 1951, Soviet officials began investigations to address the concerns of Barzani and his followers. The committee found that Barzani and his followers were unfairly treated, and in August 1951 the Soviet government reunited Barzani and the other Kurds, giving Mustafa Barzani a residence in Tashkent while the rest were given homes in a small community outside of Tashkent. All of them were provided with jobs, education, training, and social services that was given to other Soviet citizens.

Barzani would later meet with Soviet figures like Georgy Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev in May 1953 after the death of Stalin to ensure that the Soviets would continue helping him and his followers. Shortly afterwards, Soviet officials moved Barzani to a residence in Moscow and enrolled him in the Party Higher School.

Rumors also spread that Barzani was given a rank in the Red Army, which appears to have been false. Recounting the story years later to Yevgeny Primakov, Barzani recalled that he had bought a uniform at a Voentorg (military supplies) store while in Tashkent in 1951, and took a picture of himself wearing it. This picture somehow fell into the hands of British intelligence, which was the source of rumors of Barzani having been inducted as a member of the Soviet Red Army.

During his time in exile, the Kurdish Democratic Party was founded in Iraq, holding its first Congress on 16 August 1946, in Baghdad, electing Mustafa Barzani as its president. The party would later rename itself to the Kurdistan Democratic Party in January 1953 during its Third Congress.

==Iraq and revolutions==

Mustafa Barzani, following his return to Iraq in 1958, would engage in numerous insurgencies against Baghdad, often seeking and gaining support from the KGB, CIA, Mossad, MI6 and SAVAK, as well as support from Syria and Jordan depending on which country was opposed to the government in Baghdad at the time, taking advantage of the complexities of the Cold War in the Middle-East.

===Return from exile and Qasim===

Following the Republican coup against the Hashemite monarchy, the Kurds were granted more rights. In the provisional Iraqi constitution on 27 July 1958 was included that Kurds and Arabs were partners of the same nation. Following, several Kurds were appointed into high military ranks and Barzani was invited to return to Iraq. In October 1958, Barzani and his followers returned from the Soviet Union, and Barzani quickly established warm ties with Qasim. Qasim hoped to use Barzani as a potential ally in the power struggles in Iraq, as Qasim faced considerable resistance from more nationalist minded Arab officers and intellectuals in the country. Mustafa Barzani faced similar challenges within the KDP, with divisions rising over land reform, political position, and alliances with other parties in Iraq such as the Iraqi Communist Party. Barzani quickly asserted control over the KDP, ousting the General-Secretary Ibrahim Ahmad and replacing him with the pro-Communist Hamza Abdullah in January 1959 and cementing ties with the ICP.

Along with the Communists, Barzani and the KDP sided with Qasim during an uprising of Ba&#x27;athists and other Arab Nationalists in Mosul in March 1959, entering into the city to fight off the insurrection. Following a deadly riot instigated by leftists in Kirkuk in July 1959, Qasim denounced the ICP and Barzani followed suit, seeing the ICP as a rival in northern Iraq. Barzani severed ties with the party and restored Ibrahim Ahmad to his original position and elevated Jalal Talabani to the politburo during the KDP&#x27;s fourth Congress in October 1959, ending the KDP&#x27;s cooperation with the ICP. While welcoming towards the break with the ICP, Ahmad however still held suspicions of Barzani and his policy for the party and remained critical of his leadership.

Qasim in time became suspicious of Barzani, worried that his increasing power in Iraqi Kurdistan could allow him to become a potential source of opposition to his power in Iraq and possibly where foreign intelligence could instigate instability in Iraq. Qasim began to capitalize on tribal divisions in the Kurdish region, focusing on those with long-time rivalries with the Barzanis such as the Zebaris and the Harki, creating tribal disputes in the autumn of 1960. Other figures within the KDP such as Ahmad and Talabani began to voice more opposition to Qasim through party publications, displeased with the lack of progress towards any autonomy for the Kurds. Qasim severed the government stipend and privileges to Barzani by early 1961, and for much of the year tensions between Barzani and Qasim grew. Qasim suspected Barzani of being a potential avenue for the British to frustrate his take over of Kuwait and increased arms to pro-government tribes to keep Barzani from becoming any stronger. On 11 September 1961, Iraqi planes began bombardments on the Kurdish region following an ambush on a military convoy, and on 24 September Qasim ordered the closure of KDP. The following December, Barzani and the KDP severed its agreements with Baghdad and entered into hostilities with the government.

Barzani attempted to gain support from the United States, alienating many Iraqi progressives and the ICP, who felt that such a move was a betrayal for everything the KDP stood for. Barzani however managed to lead the peshmerga effectively, inflicting casualties on the military to the point that Qasim offered peace twice in November 1961 and in March 1962, both times rejected by Barzani who raised autonomy requests. Such demands were unfeasible for Qasim who knew that such a concession would damage his image, and the military campaign waged on against Barzani&#x27;s rebellion.

Through the rest of 1962, Barzani&#x27;s campaign proved to cause Qasim&#x27;s position in Baghdad to become increasingly unstable, and he directed the KDP into talks with the Ba&#x27;athists and Nasserists, the two factions most likely to succeed Qasim.

===Military government===
On 8 February 1963, a military coup took place which overthrew and executed Qasim. The Nasserist Colonel Abdul Salam Arif become president of Iraq and the Ba&#x27;athist General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr become prime minister. The latter resulted in a Ba&#x27;athist domination in the government, forming the National Council of the Revolutionary Command.

Not forgetting Barzani&#x27;s role in quelling the insurrection in Mosul back in 1959, as well as Barzani&#x27;s contacts with foreign intelligence, the new government was suspicious towards Barzani. Mustafa Barzani and the government would attempt ineffective negotiations, and after Barzani&#x27;s autonomy request which included much of Iraq&#x27;s oil fields around Kirkuk and Mosul, the government moved against the KDP in northern Iraq. The campaign faced difficulties though, and allowed for President Arif&#x27;s power grab in November 1963, ousting the Ba&#x27;athists from the national government.

President Arif quickly offered Barzani a truce, which he accepted. A subsequent agreement between Barzani and Arif would end hostilities between the government and the Kurds, though autonomy was not included. By this point Barzani turned his attention towards asserting his leadership over the KDP, due to the opposition from various factions, namely the one led by Talabani and Ahmad. Soon, the political divisions evolved into one that saw Barzani leading tribal and conservative elements of Kurdish society on one end with Talabani and Ahmad leading progressive minded leftist intellectual Kurds on the other. Barzani however benefited from his agreement with Arif, which secured him funds and arms from Baghdad to assert his position.

During the sixth congress of the KDP in Qala Dizeh in July 1964, Barzani moved against Talabani and Ahmad, tasking his son Idris with ejecting Talabani, Ahmad, and their supporters from the congress. The move was successful and saw Barzani&#x27;s opposition flee into Iran, allowing him uncontested control of the KDP.

With his power secure in the KDP, Barzani raised the demand for autonomy to President Arif, quickly souring relations between the two. In March 1965, hostilities began between Barzani and Baghdad, leading to a massive military operation in northern Iraq that saw nearly 100,000 soldiers deployed by Iraq to fight Barzani and the Peshmerga, as well as other Kurdish factions such as the Talabani-Ahmad faction which had returned to Iraq. The operation was inconclusive, with the government unable to make any significant gains against Barzani and his forces, which were receiving supplies through the Iranian border. The war was further complicated by the winter, which played into the Peshmerga&#x27;s advantage. The government again utilized divisions among the Kurds in the region, and had begun supporting the Talabani-Ahmad faction of the KDP who entered into hostilities with Barzani and his supporters. Before a major operation that was to take place in March against Barzani&#x27;s headquarters near the border of Iran, President Arif died in a helicopter crash on 13 April 1966.

The death of Arif prompted a power struggle in Baghdad which gave Barzani time to reorganize, but operations resumed once more by the summer once Arif&#x27;s brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, became president and vowed to continue the war. The civilian prime minister Abd ar-Rahman al-Bazzaz saw the futility of the military operation and instead proposed Barzani a peace offer, which incorporated a number of demands of the KDP, forming the &quot;Bazzaz Declaration&quot;. Bazzaz was however forced to resign from his position in August 1966, dashing any hope for the Bazzaz Declaration to be implemented at the time.

President Arif would however recognize the troubles the war was bringing, and seeking to cement his own position in Iraq decided to visit Barzani that fall. Barzani accepted Arif&#x27;s offer of a truce, recognizing the toll the war had taken on the Kurdish people by that point. During the sixth congress of the KDP held in November that year, the KDP decided to accept the terms of the Bazzazz Declaration but indicated that it would still push for autonomy.

Barzani continued to consolidate his power in Iraqi Kurdistan, which had mostly fallen out of control from Baghdad by that point. His increasing position in the region would plague Baghdad, tying up much of its forces during the Six Day War.

===Ba&#x27;ath coup of 1968 and 1970 peace accord===
In July 1968, the Ba&#x27;ath Party, supported by the army, overthrew the Arif government and assumed control of Iraq, returning Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr back to power. The Ba&#x27;ath realized the toll the military operations in Iraq were taking and signaled its willingness to settle the Kurdish issue peacefully. The Ba&#x27;ath initially hoped to seek an agreement with the Talabani-Ahmad faction to bypass Barzani, prompting Barzani to enter into hostilities with the government again, shelling Kirkuk in March 1969. Barzani&#x27;s receipt of aid from Iran posed challenges for the Ba&#x27;ath government, complicating its military efforts in the region.

By May 1969 the government indicated its willingness to negotiate with Barzani, culminating in formal negotiations by December that year. Barzani demanded that the Ba&#x27;ath sever ties with pro-government Kurds and the Ahmad-Talabani faction, and recognize him as the sole power within the KDP, as well as terms of autonomy was also discussed. With Mahmoud Othman conducting negotiations on behalf of the KDP, and Saddam Hussein on behalf of the government, the final agreement was reached on 11 March 1970. The final terms of the agreement recognized the Kurdish people and considered Kurdish language a second official language of the republic with Arabic, along with autonomy in northern Iraq excluding Kirkuk, Khanaqin and other Kurdish cities, in exchange of full control of Iraqi army over Kurdistan.

===Collapse of the peace accord===
The government began reconstruction in northern Iraq and work towards creating an autonomous region, appointed five Kurdish men to junior-level ministries in the government, incorporating the Kurds along with the ICP into the National Front and provided Barzani with a stipend to manage the KDP. Ibrahim Ahmad and Jalal Talabani also reunified with the KDP. However relations quickly began to deteriorate as Barzani accused Iraq of continuing Arabification to decrease Kurdish standings in contested cities such as Kirkuk and in not being committed to a genuine autonomous zone. An assassination attempt took place against Barzani in September 1971 when Barzani received religious officials in his headquarters. The clerics had thought they were carrying suitcases with recording devices for the benefit of Baghdad, but had instead been wired with explosives. The explosion did not kill Barzani but killed others participating in the meeting, and in the confusion Peshmerga guards rushed in and killed the clerics. The government drivers who drove the clerics tried to salvage the assassination and tossed a grenade, killing a Peshmerga and wounding twelve, but missing Barzani, before they themselves were shot and killed. Although the conspirators were not captured, Barzani attributed responsibility for the attack to Saddam Hussein.

Following disputes with the Ba&#x27;ath regime, Barzani maintained open borders with Iran, allowing the continued flow of arms and supplies, which increased following the Soviet-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship in April 1972 once the United States was concerned about Iraq entering into the Soviet sphere like Syria. Israel also increased support to Barzani hoping to frustrate the Ba&#x27;ath in Iraq. These actions strengthened Barzani&#x27;s forces but led to criticism from some factions within the KDP and leftist groups supporting Kurdish causes in Iraq. Among the defectors from the KDP was Barzani&#x27;s own son Ubeydullah who defected from the movement and preferred to cooperate with the regime in Baghdad. Through much of 1973, Barzani began to rebuild and reorganize the Peshmerga in anticipation of another conflict with Baghdad.

On 11 March 1974, the Ba&#x27;ath government passed the autonomy law which it presented to Barzani for approval. With Kirkuk not included and his faith in the Ba&#x27;ath for a genuine autonomy low, Barzani rejected the agreement. Joining his son Ubeydullah, a number of disillusioned members of the KDP, angered with Barzani&#x27;s opening towards the United States, Israel and Iran, and the perceived betrayal of KDP&#x27;s socialist origins, defected to Baghdad.

===Renewed hostilities and defeat===
The 1975 Algiers Agreement was signed between Iran and Iraq in March during an OPEC conference in Algiers, mediated by Algerian President Houari Boumediène and thus ending the long-running feud between the two states over the Shatt al-Arab and other border disputes, with the US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger seeing it as necessary realpolitik to preserve stability in the Middle-East and close opportunities for the Soviet Union to exploit against Iran. The agreement stipulated that Iran end support for the peshmerga as well as no longer transporting supplies sent from other countries, which spelled the end for Barzani&#x27;s rebellion as it could no longer keep the peshmerga supplied. On 23 March, just a few days after the Algiers Agreement was finalized, Barzani and nearly 100,000 followers left Iraq for Iran, ending the insurrection against Iraq, and allowing the Ba&#x27;ath Party to implement its assimilation policies towards the Kurds. Ahmad and Talabani, along with their supporters, later established the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in June 1975, criticizing Barzani and KDP for what they described as &quot;the inability of the feudalist, tribalist, bourgeois, rightist and capitulationist Kurdish leadership&quot;.

==Exile and death==

Barzani and his family were settled near Tehran in Karaj. The KDP went through a chaotic period as it attempted to reorganize itself in face of the defeat at the hands of the Ba&#x27;ath in Iraq. Barzani and his aides continued trying to get support from the United States, seeing that the Soviet Union had settled for amicable relations with the new government in Iraq. The United States&#x27; support for the Kurdish movement appeared to be primarily strategic, as it focused on countering Iraq&#x27;s influence rather than advancing Kurdish nationalist goals. The findings of the Pike Commission suggested that the CIA&#x27;s involvement with the Kurdish movement was primarily strategic, aiming to weaken Iraq rather than support long-term Kurdish autonomy. Barzani lived to witness significant geopolitical changes, including the overthrow of the Shah, the departure of Henry Kissinger after Gerald Ford&#x27;s defeat in the 1976 U.S. presidential elections, and the death of Algerian President Houari Boumediene, all of which influenced the Kurdish struggle.. Seeking to treat lung cancer, Barzani went to the United States, and died on 1 March 1979, at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., while undergoing treatment. He was buried in Iranian Kurdistan in Oshnavieh after his body was flown back from the United States.

In October 1993, Barzani&#x27;s remains were brought across the border from Iran to Iraqi Kurdistan, to be reburied in his hometown of Barzan.

==Legacy==
His son, Massoud Barzani, was the leader of the KDP and was re-elected as the President of the Iraqi Kurdistan region with 66% of the popular vote in July 2009. A grandson, Nechirvan Barzani, the son of Idris Barzani, was the prime minister of Iraqi Kurdistan.

<text>Aidan Higgins (3 March 1927 – 27 December 2015) was an Irish writer. He wrote short stories, travel pieces, radio dramas and novels. Among his published works are &quot;Langrishe, Go Down&quot; (1966), &quot;Balcony of Europe&quot; (1972) and the biographical &quot;Dog Days&quot; (1998). His writing is characterised by non-conventional foreign settings and a stream of consciousness narrative mode. Most of his early fiction is autobiographical – &quot;like slug trails, all the fiction happened.&quot;

==Life==
Aidan Higgins was born in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. He attended local schools and Clongowes Wood College, a private boarding school. In the early 1950s he worked in Dublin as a copywriter for the Domas Advertising Agency. He then moved to London and worked in the light industry for about two years. He married Jill Damaris Anders in London on 25 November 1955. From 1960, Higgins sojourned in Southern Spain, South Africa, Berlin and Rhodesia. In 1960 and 1961 he worked as a scriptwriter for Filmlets, an advertising firm in Johannesburg. These journeys provided material for much of his later work, including his three autobiographies, &quot;Donkey&#x27;s Years&quot; (1996), &quot;Dog Days&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Whole Hog&quot; (2000).

Higgins lived in Kinsale, County Cork, from 1986 with the writer and journalist Alannah Hopkin. They were married in Dublin in November 1997. He was a founder member of Irish artists&#x27; association Aosdána. 

Higgins died aged 88 on 27 December 2015 in Kinsale.

==Works==

His upbringing in a landed Catholic family provided material for his first novel, &quot;Langrishe, Go Down&quot; (1966). The novel is set in the 1930s in a run-down &quot;big house&quot; in County Kildare, inhabited by the last members of the Langrishe family, three spinster sisters, Catholics, living in not-so-genteel poverty in a once-grand setting. One sister, Imogen, has an affair with a German intellectual, Otto Beck, which transgresses the moral code of the time, bringing her a brief experience of happiness. Otto&#x27;s intellectual pursuits contrast with the moribund cultural life of mid-20th-century Ireland. The book was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and was later adapted as a BBC television film by British playwright Harold Pinter, in association with RTÉ. Langrishe also received the Irish Academy of Letters Award.

His second major novel, &quot;Balcony of Europe&quot;, takes its name from a feature of the Spanish fishing village, Nerja Andalusia, where it is set. The novel is carefully crafted, and rich in embedded literary references, using Spanish and Irish settings and various languages, including Spanish and some German, in its account of the daily life in the beaches and bars of Nerja of a largely expatriate community. The protagonist, an artist called Dan Ruttle, is obsessed with his friend&#x27;s young American wife, Charlotte, and by the contrast between his life in a cosmopolitan artistic community in the Mediterranean, and his Irish origins. The book was re-edited in collaboration with Neil Murphy and published by Dalkey Archive Press in 2010, with the Irish material cut, and the affair between Dan Ruttle and Charlotte, foregrounded.

Later novels include the widely acclaimed &quot;Bornholm Night Ferry&quot; and &quot;Lions of the Grunwald&quot;. Various writings have been collected and reprinted by the Dalkey Archive Press, including his three-volume autobiography, &quot;A Bestiary&quot;, and a collection of fiction, &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot;, both of which demonstrate his wide erudition and his experience of life and travel in South Africa, Germany and London, which gives his writing a largely cosmopolitan feel, utilising a range of European languages in turns of phrase.

<doc id="802210" wikidata="Q156655" url="?curid=802210" title="704 Interamnia">
<text>704 Interamnia is a large F-type asteroid. With a mean diameter of around 330 kilometres, it is the fifth-largest asteroid, after Ceres, Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea. Its mean distance from the Sun is 3.067 AU. It was discovered on 2 October 1910 by Vincenzo Cerulli, and named after the Latin name for Teramo, Italy, where Cerulli worked. Its mass is probably between fifth and tenth highest in the asteroid belt, with a mass estimated to be 1.2% of the mass of the entire asteroid belt. Observations by the Very Large Telescope&#x27;s SPHERE imager in 2017–2019, combined with occultation results, indicate that the shape of Interamnia may be consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium for a body of its density with a rotational period of 7.6 hours. (Its current period is 8.7 hours.) This suggests that Interamnia may have formed as an equilibrium body, and that impacts changed its rotational period after it fully solidified.

==Characteristics==

Although Interamnia is the largest asteroid after the &quot;big four&quot;, it is a very little-studied body. It is easily the largest of the F-type asteroids, but until 2017-2019 there existed very few details of its internal composition or shape, and no light curve analysis has yet been done to determine the ecliptic coordinates of Interamnia&#x27;s poles (and hence its axial tilt). Studies by the Very Large Telescope give an average diameter of about 332 km and found an ellipsoidal shape for Interamnia, similar to 4 Vesta; the resulting density calculation (1.98 ± 0.68 g·cm−3) is not precise enough to definitely infer Interamnia&#x27;s composition, but the presence of hydrated materials at the surface and its overall spectral similarities to Ceres suggest that it is likely an icy body. The absence of an affiliated asteroid family implies that Interamnia has not suffered a giant impact within the past 3 billion years, in contrast to 4 Vesta and 10 Hygiea.

Its very dark surface and relatively large distance from the Sun means Interamnia can never be seen with 10x50 binoculars. At most oppositions its magnitude is around +11.0, which is less than the &quot;minimum&quot; brightness of Vesta, Ceres or Pallas. Even at a perihelic opposition its magnitude is only +9.9, which is over four magnitudes lower than Vesta.

==Surface==

There are no deep basins visible in the VLT images. Any large craters must have flat floors, consistent with an icy C/F-type composition.

==Mass==
In 2001, Michalak estimated Interamnia to have a mass of . Michalak&#x27;s estimate depends on the masses of 19 Fortuna, 29 Amphitrite, and 16 Psyche; thus this mass was obtained assuming an incomplete dynamical model.

In 2011, Baer calculated Interamnia had a mass of .

Goffin&#x27;s 2014 astrometric reanalysis gives an even lower mass of .

In 2019, Hanuš et al. consolidated 21 selected prior mass estimates, dating from 1992 to 2017, with a metastatistical result of (that is, to within 1 sigma uncertainty.

<text>Dimbulah is a rural town and locality in Far North Queensland, Australia, from Cairns by road, on the Atherton Tableland. It is within the local government area of Shire of Mareeba (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Tablelands Region). In the , the locality of Dimbulah had a population of 975 people, a decrease from the 1,050 people in the .

== Geography ==

Dimbulah is approximately south-west of Cairns. The town was established near the Walsh River as a watering point for trains servicing the Hodgkinson goldfields to the north-west along with the former mining town of Wolfram which is also located to the north-west of the locality. There are historical ruins of early mining there as well as a present-day open cut mine.

The Tablelands railway line passes through the locality which is served by the following railway stations (from north to south):

* Chircan railway station, now abandoned ()
* Dimbulah railway station ()
* Leafgold railway station, now abandoned ()
* Carbonate Creek railway station, now abandoned ()
* Solanum railway station, now abandoned ()
* Boonmoo railway station ()
* Verdure railway station, now abandoned ()

Due to the availability of water, Dimbulah also established itself as an agricultural area. However, the Walsh River alone was not reliable enough as a source of water for irrigation. The establishment of Tinaroo Dam and the Mareeba-Dimbulah irrigation scheme provided water security which led to the establishment of many large-scale agricultural enterprises, starting with the expansion of the tobacco industry.

The soils types in the Dimbulah area are particularly suited to tobacco farming due to being based on granitic sand. The &#x27;lighter&#x27; soils facilitated the cultivation of a lighter style of tobacco leaf which was in high demand. Some of the soil types in the area include: Murphy, Algoma, Price and Cobra. These soils are mostly colluvial soils derived from weathered metamorphic rock as well as older alluvium derived from granitic rock.

The main vegetation is low open woodlands consisting mainly of the eucalypts such as bloodwood, box along with melaleucas and a grass cover of kangaroo grass and spear grass.

== Climate ==
Local residents enjoy a tropical climate with hot, wet summers and dry, mild winters.

== History ==
The town was established in 1876 to service the Tyrconnell Gold Mine, one of the richest mines on the Hodgkinson Gold Fields. The name &quot;Dimbulah&quot; is thought to have come from the local Indigenous Australian word for &quot;long waterhole&quot;, referring to the Walsh River that runs nearby the town. Dimboola Post Office opened by 1900 and was renamed Dimbulah in 1904.

The area around Dimbulah was originally home to the Djankun and Kuku Djungan tribe. During the 1920s the Queensland Government forcibly removed most of their children, forcing the tribe to scatter.

In the early 1900s the area received an influx of Italian migrants and in 1928 tobacco was introduced, becoming the area&#x27;s major industry soon after. At its peak, there were 800 growers in the area, producing over 8,000 tonnes (60% of national yield) of tobacco a year. &quot;The Way Back In&quot; is an Australian heritage project that documents a small selection of Australian heritage within the Italian communities in Dimbulah, Innisfail and Cairns.

Boonmoo Provisional School opened circa July 1910 and closed circa April 1912. It was on Boonmoo Road ().

Dimbulah Provisional School opened on 28 September 1914. On 1 December 1914, it became Dimbulah State School. On 25 January 1965, it was expanded to include a secondary department. The school celebrated its centenary on 27 September 2014.

The Dimbulah parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns was established in 1963.

St Anthony&#x27;s Catholic School opened in January 1966 by the Sisters of St Joseph with an initial enrolment of 64 students. The Sisters operated the school for 22 years, after which it was operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns.

A significant number of Croatian immigrants settled in Dimbulah and it was the site of numerous attempts to set up Croatian Ustaše training camps. On 4 October 1972, the Dimbulah bridge was bombed with close to 100 sticks of gelignite. 

The Dimbulah Public Library opened in 1995 with a minor refurbishment in 2013.

== Demographics ==
In the , the locality of Dimbulah had a population of 1,414 people.

In the , the locality of Dimbulah had a population of 1,050 people.

In the , the locality of Dimbulah had a population of 975 people.

== Heritage listings ==
Dimbulah has a number of sites listed on the Queensland Heritage Register including:
* Main Street, Wolfram: La Société Française des Métaux Rares treatment plant
* Wolfram Road, Wolfram: Thermo Electric Ore Reduction Corporation Mill

== Economy ==
Tobacco remained the dominant crop until recent years when government policy compelled its demise. Recent attempts at alternative crops such as tea trees, mangoes, sugar cane, coffee, lemons, limes, avocados, papaws, papayas, peanuts, soya beans, lychees, grapes and cash crops (pumpkins, melons, etc.) have met with mixed success. Farming is a significant employment option in Dimbulah and many travelers, including backpackers, are employed as short-term farm labourers, particularly during the busy mango harvest from November to January.

== Education ==

Dimbulah State School is a government primary and secondary (Prep-10) school for boys and girls at 48-50 Kennedy Street (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 150 students with 17 teachers (14 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent).

St Anthony&#x27;s School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 3 Hyde Street (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 37 students with 8 teachers (5 full-time equivalent) and 10 non-teaching staff (4 full-time equivalent).

There are no schools offering education to Year 12 in Dimbulah. The nearest government secondary school with education to Year 12 is Mareeba State High School in Mareeba to the north-east. However, it would be too distant from some parts of Dimbulah and distance education and boarding schools would be other options.

Also available are:
* Dimbulah Limited Hours Child Care, Age range 15 months – 5 years
* Dimbulah Kindergarten, Age range 3–5 years (C&amp;K Affiliated)

== Amenities ==

The Mareeba Shire operates a public library at Shire Hall at the corner of Raleigh Street and Burke Development Road.

The Dimbulah branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association meets at the QCWA Hall at 22 Brickley Street.

St Anthony&#x27;s Catholic Church is in Raleigh Street. It is within the Dimbulah Parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns which is administered from the Atherton parish.

<text>The Beira Patrol was a blockade of oil shipments to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) through Beira, Mozambique, resulting from United Nations trade sanctions on Rhodesia.

==Background==
Rhodesia&#x27;s government unilaterally declared the former colony&#x27;s independence on 11 November 1965, after rejecting British preconditions for independence that involved racial equality and rule by the black majority. Ian Smith, the country&#x27;s elected prime minister, continued in that role. The United Nations Security Council reacted by passing Resolution 217, calling for sanctions on Rhodesia. The resolution was later used by the British as legal justification for the blockade.

Britain imposed its own national sanctions, including an oil embargo, but ruled out invading Rhodesia. The British were initially opposed to military action, instead relying on UN sanctions to pressure the Rhodesians. A majority of UN member states wanted expanded sanctions and military measures. The British initially attempted to block such initiatives.

In October 1965, the Joint Intelligence Committee estimated that even a full trade embargo would fail to cripple Rhodesia&#x27;s economy due to sanctions evasion enabled by Portuguese Mozambique and South Africa, but suggested that prolonged and severe economic pressure could induce the white electorate to overthrow the government. In early 1966, Prime Minister Harold Wilson made statements that sanctions were working, predicting that the Rhodesian government would soon fall. At the same time, the Foreign Office was feverishly negotiating with the Portuguese Government to participate in the sanctions, which would effectively impose a total blockade on Rhodesia. By the end of 1966, when it became clear that Portugal was unwilling to cooperate against Rhodesia, the Royal Navy began looking into the possibility of a maritime blockade against Mozambique-bound ships carrying oil destined for Rhodesia.

During the first week of February 1966, it became clear that Rhodesia continued to import oil by land from Portuguese Mozambique, and Prime Minister Wilson was warned that black African states could push for more urgent sanctions and raise the matter at the UN. On 24 February, the Chiefs of Staff Committee warned that tankers with oil for Rhodesia could arrive in the port of Beira, the terminus of a pipeline going to Rhodesia, unnoticed, and began preparing a maritime surveillance plan for submission to the Prime Minister. Later in February, the British government and world press began focusing on tankers carrying oil for Rhodesia when on 25 February, the Rhodesian Commerce and Industry Minister announced that a tanker with oil for Rhodesia would soon arrive.

==Blockade==
Following the reports of Rhodesia defying the oil embargo by sea, the British felt pressure to take action and thus prove their commitment to sanctions. On 1 March, the Royal Navy established the Beira Patrol. As many nations had committed themselves to the policy of sanctions, it was required that the nationalities of any tankers carrying oil to Beira should be known. This was the task of aircraft carrier and the escort forces HMS &quot;Rhyl&quot;, HMS &quot;Lowestoft&quot; and later . Stationed off Beira, directing it to prepare for intercept operations starting on 4 March. Consequently, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; left Mombasa on 1 March 1966 and was ordered to proceed to the Mozambique Channel to commence a surveillance patrol off Beira. On 6 March, early warning aircraft from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; began search operations in the Mozambique Channel. The frigate HMS &quot;Rhyl&quot; and a logistical support ship were soon added. On 28 Feb 1966 had sailed from Singapore on passage to Beira and remained on station until 10 May 1966 (being relieved by &quot;Ark Royal&quot;), returning to Singapore on 10 May 1966. In 71 days &quot;Eagle&quot; flew 1,070 sorties, flying 600,000 miles, surveying 200,000 square miles daily, steaming a total of 30,000 miles.

The patrol lasted until 1975. At any time, two British frigates or destroyers, with the support of land and carrier-based surveillance aircraft and auxiliary vessels, were committed to the patrol. Various British warships cruised the Mozambique Channel from Beira and checking on oil tankers heading for the port. As an example of such deployments, interrupted her passage out to Singapore to carry out a deployment on the Beira Patrol early in 1967.

Initially, Royal Navy ships were to shadow and question Beira-bound tankers, and were only allowed to forcibly divert a tanker away after Britain obtained permission from its flag state. However, in the event that permission was granted, British warships were only allowed to demand it change course in the name of its flag state, and fire a shot across the bow if it did not work. The use of force was not authorised, and if the tanker absolutely refused to comply, the shadowing warship could take no more action and only follow it to within Mozambique&#x27;s six-mile territorial limit. This meant that the tanker would be allowed to proceed unhindered to port.

After an incident where the Greek tanker &quot;Joanna V&quot; was intercepted by HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot;, but as &quot;Plymouth&quot; was not authorised to use force, the tanker freely sailed into Beira, the British lobbied for UN authority to use force. The UN Security Council subsequently passed Resolution 221. However, the resolution confined the blockade to Beira and authorised only the Royal Navy to use force. As a result, the Royal Navy alone had to enforce the blockade without assistance, and tankers with oil for Rhodesia could freely dock at other Mozambican ports. The resolution also empowered the British to seize the &quot;Joanna V&quot; upon its departure from Beira if it had discharged its oil cargo there. On 8 April 1967, the frigate intercepted the tanker &quot;Manuella&quot; and escorted her away from the Mozambique Channel, but when &quot;Berwick&quot; broke off for refuelling, &quot;Manuella&quot; again set course for Beira, but was intercepted by the frigate , which kept the tanker from reaching Beira.

The rules of engagement were subsequently liberalised, but use of force was limited &quot;to the very minimum&quot;, and Defence Ministry approval was required for the diversion of vessels. British warships also had to remain outside of Portugal&#x27;s territorial waters. After an embarrassing incident involving the French tanker &quot;Artois&quot;, which ignored a challenge from the frigate with &quot;Minerva&quot; firing warning shots before the MoD signalled that &quot;Artois&quot; was authorised to enter Beira, the rules of engagement were further modified, allowing the use of disabling fire.

Britain never managed to obtain UN authority allowing other navies to participate. As well as lacking UN permission, the British judged it outside their capabilities to blockade other Mozambican ports, at the cost of risking relations with Portugal, a fellow member of NATO. South Africa was also capable of transporting oil to Beira by having tankers cruise through South African and then Portuguese territorial waters, providing legal immunity from interception. As a result, Rhodesia continued to receive oil shipments. Rhodesia was also able to withstand the blockade by strictly rationing oil. In September 1966, it was estimated that Rhodesia received 220,000 gallons of oil daily, when it needed only 200,000 a day under its rationing policy.

The patrol was gradually reduced in several stages. In March 1971, new Prime Minister Edward Heath allowed the Royal Navy to commit one warship at a time, rather than two. Three months later, the patrol lost its air component when the Malagasy Republic asked the Royal Air Force to eliminate its detachment at Majunga. After an overall drop in the number of frigates in the fleet, the Royal Navy was allowed to make the patrol intermittent. The patrol was finally eliminated on 25 June 1975, when Mozambique gained independence from Portugal and assured Britain that it would not allow transship oil to Rhodesia.

The operation had cost more than 100 million pounds, and 76 Royal Navy ships took part in the operation. A total of 47 oil tankers were intercepted, of which 42 were allowed to proceed.

<text>The Tikbalang (/ˈtikbaˌlaŋ/) (also Tigbalang, Tigbalan, Tikbalan, Tigbolan, or Werehorse) is a creature of Philippine folklore said to lurk in the mountains and rainforests of the Philippines. It is a tall, bony humanoid (half-human and half-horse) creature with the head and hooves of a horse and disproportionately long limbs, to the point that its knees reach above its head when it squats down. In some versions, it is a transformation of an aborted fetus sent to earth from limbo.

==Origins==
As horses weren&#x27;t native to the Philippines in the pre-Spanish era, the earliest written records about the tikbalang did not specify horse or animal morphology. 

Documents from Spanish friars such as Juan de Plasencia&#x27;s &quot;Customs of the Tagalogs&quot; (1589) describe the tikbalang as ghosts and spirits of the forests, associated with the terms &quot;multo&quot; and &quot;bibit&quot;. 

Entries in early Spanish-Tagalog dictionaries defined &quot;tigbalang&quot; as &quot;fantasma de montes&quot; (phantoms of the mountains/wilds), linking them strongly as nature spirits.

An offensive expression &quot;&quot;tigbalang ca mandin!&quot;(You are a wild beast!)&quot; was used by early Tagalogs to signify one as uncouth and uncivilized. 

In historical dictionaries (San Buenaventura&#x27;s 1613 Vocabulario spelled as &quot;tigbalang&quot;), they were likened to the tiyanac, while in some entries they were given the definition as &quot;satyrs&quot; (satiro), &quot;gnomes&quot; (duendes) or &quot;goblins&quot; (trasgo). 

===Horse-like appearance===

Later on, as horses were brought from China and Japan through the Spanish colonial government, accounts of the tikbalang appearing horse-like slowly became the norm.

Juan Francisco de San Antonio&#x27;s &quot;Cronicas&quot;(1738-1744) describes the tikbalang as a malevolent entity living in the mountains, able to shapeshift into a variety of forms, including horses.

However, the very first document to actually describe the tikbalang as specifically having the appearance of a werehorse as it is more commonly known is Juan José Delgado&#x27;s &quot;Biblioteca Histórica Filipina&quot; (orig. ca. 1750). 

Delgado recounts an alleged incident wherein a young boy from the town of San Mateo, after having escaped an attempted abduction by the tikbalang, described the creature as follows:

&quot;&quot;a very tall and skinny black man, with a long face like a horse, the shins of his legs reaching above his head when squatting down...(he had) very long ears and nose and somewhat short horns on his forehead, very large and frightening eyes, and the mouth of a horse.&quot;

Delgado also mentions the name &quot;unglo&quot;&quot; being used by the Visayans to refer to the same creature as the tikbalang.

==Superstitions==
Tikbalangs or Tigbolan scare travelers, lead them astray and play tricks on them such as making them return to an arbitrary path no matter how far they go or turn. This is counteracted by wearing one&#x27;s shirt inside out. Another countermeasure is to ask permission out loud to pass by or, not to produce too much noise while in the woods in order not to offend or disturb the tikbalang. The &quot;tigbolan&quot; is a ghost which assumes a variety of forms, and sometimes confers a similar gift upon a certain favored individual. A superstition popular with the Tagalogs of Rizal Province is that Tikbalangs are benevolent guardians of elemental kingdoms. They are usually found standing at the foot of large trees looking around for anyone who dares to bestow malignancy on their kingdom&#x27;s territory.

A common saying has it that rain from a clear sky means &quot;may kinakasal na tikbalang.&quot;(Filipino, &quot;a tikbalang is getting married&quot;.) This was potentially connected with a similar Spanish proverb that claimed a witch was getting married when there was rain on a sunny day, although many cultures have such sayings in which a trickster figure gets married (cp. fox&#x27;s wedding, bear&#x27;s wedding, monkey&#x27;s birthday/wedding).

In some versions, the tikbalang can also transform itself into human form or turn invisible to humans. They like to lead travelers astray.

Individual tikbalangs, even today among superstitious Filipinos, are thought to inhabit trees as guardians (sometimes depicted as if the very soul of these trees). Specific trees (and nature in general) in pre-colonial Philippines were considered sacred (often used as shrines), esp. the large ficus trees (known locally as balete).

Tikbalang is generally associated with dark, sparsely populated, foliage-overgrown areas, with legends variously identifying their abode as being beneath bridges, in bamboo clumps or banana groves, and atop Kalumpang (Sterculia foetida) or Balite (Ficus indica) trees.

Account of Iluminado Cataytay (1959) from Barangay Sumilang, Quezon province, Philippines provides accurate information, as he witnessed from age of 4 up to his death in 1969.

==Taming a tikbalang==
By one account a tikbalang has a mane of sharp spines, with the three thickest of these being of particular importance. A person who obtains one of these spines can use them as an &quot;anting-anting&quot; (talisman) to keep the tikbalang as his servant. The tikbalang must first be subdued, however, by leaping onto it and tying it with a specially-prepared cord. The would-be-tamer must then hang on while the creature flies through the air, fighting madly to dislodge its unwelcome rider until it is exhausted and acknowledges its defeat. Or you can look on his mane and you will see 3 golden hairs and if you pluck 3 of them before he/she eats you, they will serve you until you die.

==In popular culture==
* A tikbalang named Lusyo features prominently in &quot;The Mythology Class&quot;, a graphic novel written and illustrated by Filipino comic creator Arnold Arre.
* &quot;Tikbalang Kung Kabilugan ng Buwan&quot; is a child-friendly telling of the Tikbalang mythos – written by Victoria Añonuevo, illustrated by Kora Dandan-Albano and released by Adarna House – intended to familiarize young Filipino audiences with Philippine Mythological creatures. In the story, a Tikbalang becomes lonely for lack of a playmate during the full moon, a time when Filipino children of generations past traditionally went out to play in the moonlight. In a search for a playmate, the Tikbalang leaves his home in the Kalumpang tree and encounters first a Kapre, then a Nuno, an Aswang, and a Tiyanak before he finally meets another Tikbalang as a suitable playmate.
* A Tikbalang features as a fae in series 3, episode 10 (&quot;Delinquents&quot;) of the SyFy supernatural drama &quot;Lost Girl&quot;.
* A Tikbalang was featured as the deity itself, another as a racecar driver, and more as the fighters in the fighting scene in the Netflix&#x27;s Singaporean anime-influenced streaming television series based on the Filipino comic series, Trese, that was released the day before the Philippines&#x27; Independence Day.
* Tikbalang is the name of a unit in the wargame Infinity, where many of the war machines are given mythological names.
* Tikbalang, along with other creatures are also appeared in 1978 adult animated film, &quot;Tadhana&quot; (Destiny).
* Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury features a flight system called &#x27;Tickbalang&#x27; that the series&#x27; mecha use for aerial transport.
* Tikbalang is depicted in an adult animated short film &quot;Fly Aswang&quot;, directed by Mark Galvez.

<doc id="802226" wikidata="Q1058888" url="?curid=802226" title="Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies">
<text>There were a succession of Soviet secret police agencies over time. The Okhrana was abolished by the Provisional government after the first revolution of 1917, and the first secret police after the October Revolution, created by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s decree on December 20, 1917, was called &quot;Cheka&quot; (ЧК). Officers were referred to as &quot;chekists&quot;, a name that is still informally applied to people under the Federal Security Service of Russia, the KGB&#x27;s successor in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

For most agencies listed here, secret policing operations were only part of their function; for instance, the KGB was both a secret police and an intelligence agency.

== History of the Soviet state security organs ==
===Detailed chronology===

*Cheka (abbreviation of &quot;Vecheka&quot;, itself an acronym for &quot;All-Russian Extraordinary Committee to Combat Counter-Revolution and Sabotage&quot; of the Russian SFSR)
**Felix Dzerzhinsky (December 20, 1917 – July 7, 1918)
**Yakov Peters (July 7, 1918 – August 22, 1918)
**Felix Dzerzhinsky (August 22, 1918 – February 6, 1922)

February 6, 1922: Cheka transforms into GPU, a department of the NKVD of the Russian SFSR.

*NKVD – &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs&quot;
**GPU – State Political Directorate
***Dzerzhinsky (February 6, 1922 – November 15, 1923)

November 15, 1923: GPU leaves the NKVD and becomes all-union OGPU under direct control of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the USSR.

*OGPU – &quot;Joint State Political Directorate&quot; or &quot;All-Union State Political Board&quot;
**Dzerzhinsky (November 15, 1923 – July 20, 1926)
**Vyacheslav Menzhinsky (July 30, 1926 – May 10, 1934)

July 10, 1934: NKVD of the Russian SFSR ceases to exist and transforms into the all-union NKVD of the USSR; OGPU becomes GUGB (&quot;Main Directorate for State Security&quot;) in the all-union NKVD.

*NKVD – &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs&quot;
**GUGB – &quot;Main Directorate for State Security&quot;
***Genrikh Yagoda (July 10, 1934 – September 26, 1936)
***Nikolai Yezhov (September 26, 1936 – November 25, 1938)
***Lavrentiy Beria (November 1938 – February 3, 1941)

February 3, 1941: The GUGB of the NKVD was briefly separated out into the NKGB, then merged back in, and then on April 14, 1943, separated out again.

*NKGB – &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security&quot;
**Vsevolod Merkulov (February 3, 1941 – July 20, 1941) (NKGB folded back into NKVD)
*NKVD – &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs&quot;
**GUGB – &quot;Main Directorate for State Security&quot;
***Lavrentiy Beria (July 20, 1941 – April 14, 1943)
*NKGB – &quot;People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security&quot;
**Vsevolod Merkulov (April 14, 1943 – March 18, 1946) (NKGB reseparated from NKVD)

March 18, 1946: All People&#x27;s Commissariats were renamed to Ministries.

*MGB – &quot;Ministry of State Security&quot;
**Viktor Abakumov (March 18, 1946 – July 14, 1951)
**Sergei Ogoltsov (July 14, 1951 – August 9, 1951) (acting)
**Semyon Ignatyev (August 9, 1951 – March 5, 1953)

The East German secret police, the Stasi, took their name from this iteration.

* – &quot;Committee of Information&quot; (foreign intelligence service)
**Peter Fedotov MGB
**Fedor Kuznetsov GRU
**Yakov Malik Foreign Ministry

May 30, 1947: Official decision with the expressed purpose of &quot;upgrading coordination of different intelligence services and concentrating their efforts on major directions&quot;. In the summer of 1948 the military personnel in KI were returned to the Soviet military to reconstitute foreign military intelligence service (GRU). KI sections dealing with the new East Bloc and Soviet émigrés were returned to the MGB in late 1948. In 1951 the KI returned to the MGB.

March 5, 1953: MVD and MGB are merged into the MVD by Lavrentiy Beria.

*MVD – &quot;Ministry of Internal Affairs&quot;
**Lavrentiy Beria (March 5, 1953 – June 26, 1953)
**Sergei Kruglov (June 26, 1953 – March 13, 1954)
March 13, 1954: Newly independent force became the KGB, as Beria was purged and the MVD divested itself again of the functions of secret policing. After renamings and tumults, the KGB remained stable until 1991.

*KGB – Committee for State Security
**Ivan Serov (March 13, 1954 – December 8, 1958)
**Alexander Shelepin (December 25, 1958 – November 13, 1961)
**Vladimir Semichastny (November 13, 1961 – May 18, 1967)
**Yuri Andropov (May 18, 1967 – May 26, 1982)
**Vitaly Fedorchuk (May 26, 1982 – December 17, 1982)
**Viktor Chebrikov (December 17, 1982 – October 1, 1988)
**Vladimir Kryuchkov (October 1, 1988 – August 28, 1991)
**Leonid Shebarshin (August 22, 1991 – August 23, 1991) (acting)
**Vadim Bakatin (August 29, 1991 – December 3, 1991)

In 1991, after the State Emergency Committee failed to overthrow Gorbachev and Yeltsin took over, General Vadim Bakatin was given instructions to dissolve the KGB.

In Russia today, KGB functions are performed by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), the Federal Counterintelligence Service which later became the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) in 1995, and the Federal Protective Service (FSO). The GRU continues to operate as well.

<doc id="802231" wikidata="Q3033529" url="?curid=802231" title="Operation (game)">
<text>Operation is a battery-operated game of physical skill that tests players&#x27; hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. The game&#x27;s prototype was invented in 1964 by University of Illinois industrial-design student John Spinello, who sold his rights to renowned toy designer Marvin Glass for $500 and the promise of a job upon graduation, which was not fulfilled. Initially produced by Milton Bradley in 1965, &quot;Operation&quot; is currently produced by Hasbro, with an estimated franchise worth $40 million.

The game is a variant of the old-fashioned electrified wire loop game popular at fairs. It consists of an &quot;operating table&quot;, lithographed with a comic likeness of a patient (nicknamed &quot;Cavity Sam&quot;) with a large red lightbulb for his nose. On the surface are several openings, labeled with the names of fictional and humorous ailments, that contain plastic pieces. The general gameplay requires players to remove these plastic objects with a pair of tweezers without touching the edge of the cavity opening.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Operation&quot; includes two sets of cards, &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;Specialist.&quot; The Specialist cards are dealt evenly to the players at the start of the game, and any extra cards are removed from play. The Doctor cards are shuffled to form a deck and are placed face-down.

In the American and Australian versions, players take turns drawing the top Doctor card from the deck, offering a cash payment for removing a particular object. The player in control uses a pair of tweezers (dubbed &quot;Electro Probe&quot; in earlier versions), connected to the board by a wire, to remove the piece without touching the metal edges of the cavity in which it rests. Successful removal of the piece awards the value shown on the card, while a failure allows the player holding the Specialist card for that ailment (if any) a chance to remove it for double value. If the Specialist card holder also fails, or if no player is holding it, the Doctor card is returned to the bottom of the deck. Cards of both types are removed from play as the pieces corresponding to their listed ailments are removed.

A player drawing a particular Doctor card while holding the corresponding Specialist card may deliberately fail the first attempt in order to have a second chance for double value.

The winner is the player with the most money after all plastic pieces have been extracted.

The game is challenging because of the shapes of the plastic pieces and the narrow openings are barely larger than the pieces that they contain.

==Play pieces==
*Adam&#x27;s Apple: An apple in the throat ($100).
*Broken Heart: A heart shape with a crack on the right side of the chest ($100).
*Wrenched Ankle: A wrench in the right ankle ($100).
*Butterflies in Stomach: A large butterfly in the middle of the torso ($500). (2015 Edition)
*Spare Ribs: Two ribs fused together as one piece ($150).
*Water on the Knee: A pail of water in the knee ($150). 
*Funny Bone: A cartoon-styled bone ($200).
*Charlie Horse: A small horse that rests near the hip joint ($200).
*Writer&#x27;s Cramp: A pencil in the forearm ($200). 
*Ankle Bone Connected to the Knee Bone: A rubber band that must be stretched between two pegs at the left ankle and knee. This is the only non-plastic piece in the game and the only challenge in which the player must insert rather than remove something ($200). Its name derives from the spiritual song &quot;Dem Bones&quot;.
*Wish Bone: A wishbone similar to that of a chicken located on the left side of the chest ($300).
*Brain Freeze: An ice-cream cone located in the brain ($600). This was added in 2004 when Milton Bradley allowed fans to vote on a new piece during a promotion titled &quot;What&#x27;s Ailing Sam?&quot; that included a top prize of a $5,000 shopping spree. The other contenders were Tennis Elbow and Growling Stomach.
*Bread Basket: A slice of bread with a small notch removed from the top for easier grip ($1,000).

== Other Versions ==
The 1964-1965 Saturday morning children&#x27;s game show &quot;Shenanigans&quot; had a life sized, three-dimensional Operation game as one of its challenges.

Aside from the traditional board game version, Milton Bradley also produced a hand-held version which had a screen in Sam&#x27;s tummy.

This also had a PC game produced in 1998.

In 2002, a brain surgery version was released, requiring the player to pull pieces out of a wisecracking Cavity Sam&#x27;s head, within 15 seconds. Sam&#x27;s nose lights up after time runs out.

In May 2004, a &quot;Shrek&quot; version of the game was released.

In 2005, saw the release of a &quot;Simpsons&quot; version of the game, featuring a talking Homer Simpson being operated on by doctors Julius Hibbert and Nick Riviera. Items in the game include &quot;Bowler&#x27;s Thumb&quot;, &quot;Foot in Mouth&quot;, and &quot;Rubber Neck&quot;. When a player misses, Homer screams or says one of his trademark lines such as &quot;D&#x27;oh! or &quot;This is not good!&quot;.

In December 2006, a Spider-Man version was released in which the player operates on the Marvel superhero Spider-Man. In early 2008, Hasbro featured another Marvel superhero when it released an Incredible Hulk edition of the game to promote &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; feature film. In 2010, Hasbro also released an Iron Man version of the game to promote Iron Man 2

In early 2007, a SpongeBob SquarePants version was introduced, featuring game pieces such as a &quot;shoehorn&quot; and a &quot;Krabby Patty pleasure center&quot;. Based on the Nickelodeon TV series by the same name.

Later in 2007, Hasbro released a different version of the original game called &quot;OPERATION Rescue Kit&quot; in which the participant plays four different timed games with three skill levels. Each skill level reduces the starting amount of time. Cavity Sam has a heart monitor in this version, and the player can pump oxygen into him to gain more time.

In August 2008, Hasbro released a &quot;Silly Skill Game&quot; version which features 13 different sound effects for each of the different parts. Here the winner of the game is the player who removes most parts successfully.

A &quot;Doctor Who&quot; version of the game was released in Great Britain, where players get to &quot;operate&quot; on a Dalek in order to (from the product description) &quot;make it strong enough to take over the world. But be careful... if you damage it&#x27;ll quickly tell you with one of its terrifying phrases! Whether it&#x27;s the Targeting Sensor that you need to operate on, or the Manipulator Arm, you&#x27;ll need a steady hand and nerves of steel!&quot;

In 2010, Hasbro released a &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; version featuring Buzz Lightyear as the patient. This followed the release of the &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; feature film into theaters. Another Pixar film was promoted in 2011, when Hasbro made a &quot;Cars 2&quot; edition including Mater the tow truck.

On The Hub&#x27;s television game show &quot;Family Game Night&quot; hosted by Todd Newton, a segment called Operation Relay is played, where two families compete one after the other. Family members take turns pulling pieces out of an oversized Operation gameboard, and then running through an obstacle course to eventually place them in a container at the end of the course. If a player fails to pull a piece without touching the side, or drops it while going through the obstacle course, they must move to the back of the line, and it&#x27;s the next person&#x27;s turn. Each piece is worth a specific amount of points, and whichever team has earned the highest score when time expires wins. Also on the show is Operation Sam Dunk, in which families play skee ball to collect the most points possible. Each family gets two turns and the team with the highest score wins the game. For the show&#x27;s third season, Operation is introduced, in which one family can win money for a shopping spree by removing pieces to earn up to four rolls and then play skee ball in a same manner as in Operation Sam Dunk.

In 2013 Hasbro introduced Doc McStuffins and Despicable Me 2 versions of the game.

<doc id="802251" wikidata="Q180531" url="?curid=802251" title="Gulf of Alaska">
<text>The Gulf of Alaska (Tlingit: &quot;Yéil T&#x27;ooch’&quot;) is an arm of the Pacific Ocean defined by the curve of the southern coast of Alaska, stretching from the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island in the west to the Alexander Archipelago in the east, where Glacier Bay and the Inside Passage are found.

The Gulf shoreline is a combination of forest, mountain and a number of tidewater glaciers. Alaska&#x27;s largest glaciers, the Malaspina Glacier and Bering Glacier, spill out onto the coastal line along the Gulf of Alaska. The coast is heavily indented with Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, the two largest connected bodies of water. It includes Yakutat Bay and Cross Sound. Lituya Bay (a fjord north of Cross Sound, and south of Mount Fairweather) is the site of the largest recorded tsunami in history. It serves as a sheltered anchorage for fishing boats.
The Gulf of Alaska is considered a Class I, productive ecosystem with more than 300 grams of carbon per square meter per year based on SeaWiFS data.

Deep water corals can be found in the Gulf of Alaska. &quot;Primnoa pacifica&quot; has contributed to the location being labeled as Habitat Areas of Particular Concern. &quot;P. pacifica&quot; is a deep water coral typically found between and here.

Thanks to the North Pacific Current, which is in turn fed by the warm Kuroshio Current, the Gulf of Alaska remains ice-free throughout the year. In 1977, the Gulf of Alaska started to manifest an unexpected and at that time inexplicable shift on its normal climate regime, resulting in a growth of the mean temperature of the sea surface and in an increased availability and variety of commercial fish species. A similar volatile climate change was observed during the 1970s in the North Pacific seas.

== Meteorology ==
The Gulf is a great generator of storms. In addition to dumping vast quantities of snow and ice on southern Alaska, resulting in some of the largest concentrations south of the Arctic Circle, many of the storms move south along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and as far south as Southern California (primarily during El Niño events). Much of the seasonal rainfall and snowfall in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern United States comes from the Gulf of Alaska.

== Extent ==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Alaska as follows:
&quot;On the north.&quot; The coast of Alaska.

&quot;On the south.&quot; A line drawn from Cape Spencer, the northern limit of the Coastal Waters of Southeast Alaska and British Columbia to Kabuch Point, the southeast limit of the Bering Sea, in such a way that all the adjacent islands are included in the Gulf of Alaska.
The US Geological Survey&#x27;s Geographic Names Information System database defines the Gulf of Alaska as bounded on the north by the coast of Alaska and on the south by a line running from the south end of Kodiak Island on the west to Dixon Entrance on the east.

<text>Newcastle United Jets Football Club, commonly known as Newcastle Jets, is an Australian professional soccer club based in Newcastle, New South Wales. It competes in the country&#x27;s premier competition, the A-League, under licence from the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) (formerly under licence from Football Australia). The club was formed in 2000 when it joined the National Soccer League (NSL) and was one of only three former NSL clubs to join in the formation of the A-League.

Newcastle Jets have won one A-League championship, after defeating rivals Central Coast Mariners 1–0 in the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In 2009, Newcastle competed in the AFC Champions League for the first time, reaching the Round of 16. In May 2015, FFA revoked Newcastle&#x27;s licence after owner Nathan Tinkler placed the club into voluntary administration. A new A-League club was formed for the 2015–16 season, under the same name and colours.

The club plays home games at McDonald Jones Stadium. An affiliated youth team competes in the A-League Youth and in the National Premier Leagues NSW competition. A women&#x27;s team competes in the A-League Women. The youth team&#x27;s matches are played at No. 2 Sportsground and Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility. The Women&#x27;s team play at McDonald Jones Stadium and No. 2 Sportsground.

==History ==

===Early years===
Newcastle United was formed in 2000 by Cypriot-Australian businessman Con Constantine from the remnants of the Newcastle Breakers. The Breakers were dissolved when Soccer Australia revoked its NSL licence at the conclusion of the 1999–2000 season. At the formation of Newcastle United the home ground was moved back to where Newcastle KB United played, now known as McDonald Jones Stadium.

The Newcastle United club were reasonably successful, competing in two of the last three Final Series and finishing second in the League behind Perth Glory in the 2001–02 season.

The club renamed itself to the Newcastle United Jets Football Club and launched a new badge at the start of the new national league, the A-League. This was done to try and create and project a new image of the club and to avoid confusion with the English club Newcastle United. The name &quot;Jets&quot; is a reference to RAAF Base Williamtown, located just 20 kilometres north of Newcastle. The club&#x27;s logo depicts three F/A-18 Hornets, which the Royal Australian Air Force has based at Williamtown.

Former England and Australia manager Terry Venables was reported as favourite to become the team&#x27;s technical director, including reports from the Jets, but this was confirmed by Venables&#x27; agent as a &#x27;no-go&#x27;. Instead, the club signed Richard Money for the 2005–2006 season. In 2006 Money was replaced with Nick Theodorakopoulos after Money returned to England to take the manager&#x27;s job at Walsall. In October 2006 after recording no wins during the Pre-Season Cup and during the first seven rounds of A-League matches, Theodorakopoulos became the first coach to be sacked in the club&#x27;s A-League&#x27;s history. His assistant Gary van Egmond was the caretaker coach for the remainder of the 2005–06 season, and later signed a contract to remain as the coach of the Jets for the next three years.

The club surprised many observers in the Australian game by signing Ned Zelic, a player who was seen to have severed connections with Australia after being dropped from the national team.

Reports suggested the Jets were attempting to bring former Liverpool and England striker Stan Collymore out of retirement. Director of Football Remo Nogarotto confirmed the club had made a bid to lure Collymore to the A-League for a four-match guest stint; however, the move had broken down within 24 hours of it being made public.

With the leadership of Gary van Egmond Newcastle has achieved the highest number of points out of all clubs in their last fourteen games and have also scored the most goals. As a result of their good form under van Egmond, crowds in Newcastle have reached all time highs for soccer – culminating in a crowd of over 24,000 for their home final against Sydney FC on 2 February 2007.

Newcastle were eventually eliminated in the preliminary final by Adelaide, the game going to penalties after finishing at 1 all. Vaughan Coveny and Stuart Musialik missed their attempts in a shoot-out that ended up at 4–3 in favour of Adelaide, costing Newcastle their place in the grand final and a berth in the Asian Champions League.

===Champions of Australia===

Season 3 of the A-League saw a number of Newcastle&#x27;s biggest stars of the previous season leave the club. Captain Paul Okon retired, fan favourite Milton Rodriguez returned to Colombia and Johnny Warren Medal winner Nick Carle moved to Turkey to link up with Gençlerbirliği S.K. New recruits included Joel Griffiths&#x27; twin brother Adam and previous European Golden Boot winner Mario Jardel. Although significant excitement surrounded the capture of Jardel, as time went by it was obvious he was well past his prime and received little game time. Throughout the season star striker Joel Griffiths broke the record for most goals in a regular season by scoring 12 in 21 rounds.

The Jets started the season well without losing in their first 5 matches. Following this good start the Jets struggled for consistency until the end of the season, often winning against quality opposition but losing some vital home games. Wins in the last three competition rounds saw the Jets move up the ladder to equal points with the Central Coast Mariners, finishing the season in second place due to inferior goal difference. The Jets went on to play the Mariners in the two legged Major Semi Final. The Jets won the first leg at home 2–0 thanks to a first-half header from Adam Griffiths and a late penalty from his brother Joel. The game had its fair share of controversy as Mariners striker John Aloisi had a seemingly legitimate goal disallowed and also missed a penalty.

Steeled by the defeat in the first leg, the Mariners overturned the 2–0 deficit and led 2–0 at the end of 90 minutes of the second leg thanks to goals from Sasho Petrovski and Adam Kwasnik. Seven minutes into extra time Petrovski scored again to send the Mariners into their second Grand Final in three years.

The Jets qualified for their first A-League Grand Final by beating Queensland Roar 3–2 after extra time in the 2008 Preliminary Final on 17 February 2008. The Jets led 1–0 until deep into injury time when the Roar were awarded a penalty which Reinaldo successfully converted, sending the match into extra time. A few minutes into extra time the Jets were awarded a penalty as well, as Song Jin-Hyung was brought down in the box. Joel Griffiths was successful from the spot to restore the 1-goal advantage and a few moments later Tarek Elrich sealed passage into the Grand Final with a well timed shot to score his first A-League goal. Although the Roar received another late penalty it was too late to stop the Jets&#x27; march into the Grand Final.

The Jets defeated the Central Coast Mariners in the 2007–08 A-League Grand Final, becoming A-League Champions for the first time.

The game was sealed with a solitary Joel Griffiths strike early in the second half. In his last game of professional football Tony Vidmar made a mistake near the halfway line to gift Griffiths with an opportunity which he grasped with both hands. The game was marred by a late penalty appeal for handball. Mariners goal keeper Danny Vukovic had come up for the corner and was so infuriated by Mark Shield&#x27;s decision that he slapped his hand away, earning himself a lengthy ban and ruling himself out of the early rounds of next season. Both the Jets and Mariners qualified to take part in the 2009 AFC Champions League.

=== 2008 AFC Champions League===
In order to rebuild the team for the Champions League the Jets, very much in need of several new players, signed Perth defender Nikolai Topor-Stanley in early January 2008. But the signing of Topor-Stanley would prove to be the Jets&#x27; sole gain on the transfer market for several weeks, and fans grew even more disgruntled as the Jets were confirmed as the 2009 A-League &quot;Wooden Spooners&quot; with a 2–0 loss to Adelaide United in mid-January. An encouraging 2–1 win over Perth Glory in the Jets&#x27; final home game of the A-League 2008-09 season lightened the mood somewhat, but when the Jets crashed in a 4–0 capitulation at the Sydney Football Stadium the following week, things were looking grim. And the picture only grew bleaker as the notorious player exodus continued and the club lost Socceroos defender Mark Milligan to Shanghai Shenhua, along with Jesper Hakansson, who left the club after agreeing to a mutual termination. Talisman and captain Joel Griffiths also agreed to move to Asia, although only on a one-year loan to Beijing Guoan.

The first ten days of February saw the Jets engage in a surprisingly successful flurry of transfer activity to bolster their squad for the impending Champions League before 11 February date by which clubs are required to submit their squad lists. Acting on an urgent need to improve their attacking stocks, the Jets announced simultaneously the signing of Dutchman Donny de Groot from De Graafschap along with former Sydney FC and Central Coast Mariners striker Sasho Petrovski. Next, the Jets reinforced their shaky defence by obtaining the signatures of talented former FC Thun and Melbourne Victory defender Ljubo Miličević, who had been battling depression since being released by the Victory, veteran centre-back Angelo Costanzo from Adelaide United, and young Sydney FC left-back Nikolas Tsattalios. These signings were followed by the surprise announcement that the Jets had secured the services of former S.S. Lazio forward Fabio Vignaroli on a six-month contract. In a further boost for the depth of its squad, the club signed three local players on six-month deals with the option for an extension into the 2009–10 A-League season: former Newcastle United midfielder Mitchell Johnson and strikers Peter Haynes and Joel Wood.

After the departure of high performance manager Ian Crook, the Jets signed former Sydney FC boss Branko Culina as their new Technical Director.

The Jets got off to a bad start, losing 2–0 to Beijing Guoan in Beijing. However, they rebounded with a 2–0 defeat of Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i back in Newcastle. After a heroic 1–1 draw in Japan against Nagoya Grampus, they lost 1–0 in the return fixture. Then, on 6 May, the Jets grabbed two goals in the last two minutes to defeat Beijing in Newcastle 2–1. The Jets qualified for the last 16 by defeating Ulsan Hyundai 1–0 away from home with Jason Hoffman scoring his debut goal to seal the win. The Jets faced Pohang Steelers in their round of 16 fixture on 24 June, crashing out of the competition 6–0 to the hands of the South Koreans.

===Čulina tenure===

After the success of the 2007–08 season, a number of Jets players left the club, including Mark Bridge and Stuart Musialik to Sydney FC and Joe Marston Medal winner Andrew Durante and Troy Hearfield to Wellington Phoenix. Although rumours persisted about captain Jade North and Adam Griffiths wishing to leave the club after being a part of the Socceroos squad that faced Singapore and China, both chose to remain with the Jets for the 2008–09 season. The regular season proved to be a disaster for the Jets. The team won only four out of twenty-one matches and were rooted to the bottom of the ladder, missing the finals for the first time, and collecting their first wooden spoon.

Preparations for the following season were thrown into turmoil when championship-winning manager Gary van Egmond left the club for a lucrative job with the Australian Institute of Sport. That created a public rift between the club and FFA over FFA&#x27;s possible involvement in inducing van Egmond to break his contract by taking up the new position. The relationship between owner and FFA fell to the point where the club has threatened legal action against both the FFA and van Egmond for breach of contract. Former club technical director, Branko Čulina, was named as his replacement on 30 June 2009.

In the 2009–10 Season, the Jets qualified for the finals series after coming sixth in the regular season. In the first week of the finals the Jets unexpectedly defeated Gold Coast in a penalty shoot-out 6 goals to 5, after the full time score had been 0–0. In the second week, they played Wellington Phoenix. The full time score was 1–1, but in extra time, Paul Ifill scored the match winner for Wellington followed by a goal from Eugène Dadi, putting the Jets out of the competition.

Prior to Newcastle&#x27;s round 4 game against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress and was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. That resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the A-League television deal. It was announced by the club and Football Federation Australia that the governing body would provide a short-term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability.

After weeks of speculation about the future of the Jets, it was announced by the FFA on 22 September, before the team&#x27;s midweek game against Gold Coast United, that businessman Nathan Tinkler would buy a majority share in the Jets, saving the club from ruin. Tinkler had a positive influence at the Jets. A new price for tickets included a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100, and general admission for $10.

The club gained the Hunter Medical Research Institute as a new sponsor, and its logo appeared on the front of the players shirts. The Institute said it would donate $5000 for every goal scored at home and $2500 for an away goal. The club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Čulina until March 2015, and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department. It was confirmed that the Jets would host Los Angeles Galaxy, which included big-name players such as David Beckham and Landon Donovan, for a friendly in November 2010. The Jets won the match 2–1.

During the January transfer window, the Jets announced the signing of Ryan Griffiths, the brother of Newcastle Jets legend Joel Griffiths, for the remainder of the season and the 2011–2012 season. With the future of North Queensland Fury in doubt, the Newcastle Jets signed Chris Payne for the 2011–2012 season. 16 December 2010 saw the inaugural meeting of the new Football Advisory Board put in place by new owner Nathan Tinkler. The board included prominent names from Newcastle&#x27;s soccer history, community members, and the president of Northern NSW Football. The Jets finished the 2010–11 season in seventh position, narrowly missing out on the finals series on the last day of the regular season.

===The Return of van Egmond===
On 4 October 2011, the club terminated the contract of coach Branko Čulina, as well commencing the process of applying to the FFA to have the three-year &quot;marquee&quot; contract of (Čulina&#x27;s son) Jason set aside. Although no one reason was cited for the decision it was believed that an argument was reached between Branko, CEO Robbie Middleby, and owner Nathan Tinkler, regarding the nepotist nature of Jason&#x27;s signing, as well as &quot;medical advice&quot;. Middleby stated: &quot;The decision to terminate the contracts was made after a long deliberation by the Newcastle Jets’ Advisory Board&quot;. While Tinkler stated that &quot;Jason&#x27;s injury could mean the Jets are without their marquee player for up to three seasons – not a good result for the club, supporters, sponsors and players.&quot; The Jets appointed Gary van Egmond as Čulina&#x27;s replacement.

In April 2012, Nathan Tinkler announced that he would hand back the Newcastle Jets A-League licence to the FFA, because of his mounting financial difficulties. The Federation said that Tinkler&#x27;s Hunter Sports Group could not just hand back its licence, and was breaching a binding contract by walking away from the Jets. On 1 May, after face-to-face talks between Tinkler and FFA chairman Frank Lowy, it was announced that Tinkler would remain the owner of the club.
At the end of the 2011–12 A-League season, Gary van Egmond started a clean-out by getting rid of the majority of Branko Čulina&#x27;s squad. That including fan-favourites Jeremy Brockie, Tarek Elrich, Labinot Haliti and Nikolai Topor-Stanley. Van Egmond implemented his possession-based style by signing many young talents such as James Brown, Scott Neville and Craig Goodwin. The Jets went unbeaten throughout the entire 2012–13 pre-season, with wins over defending champions Brisbane Roar and rivals Central Coast Mariners.

On 21 September 2012, the Jets signed former England international and Premier League giant Emile Heskey as their marquee player for the 2012–13 season. Heskey signed for a one-year deal but hoped to extend his stay. He wore the number 9 jersey throughout his time in Newcastle. The Jets lost their first game of the season against Adelaide United, but then went on to beat Sydney FC, rivals Central Coast Mariners and Melbourne Victory, to sit second behind Adelaide on goal difference after round 4.

During the January transfer window, the Jets released Brazilian international Tiago Calvano, due to his lack of game time and falling out of favour with head coach Gary van Egmond. The Jets replaced Tiago with attacking midfielder Zenon Caravella, and signed local talent Andrew Hoole to his first professional contract after he impressed in the round 15 match against the Brisbane Roar. On 31 January 2013, club captain and foundation player Jobe Wheelhouse, terminated his contract because he wanted a break from football. Ruben Zadkovich wore the captain&#x27;s arm band for the rest of the season. The Jets finished 8th, missing out on the finals for the third year in a row. During the following season, van Egmond was sacked after 15 matches, due to poor results and a lack of harmony within the squad.

===2014–2017===

On 5 May 2014, Phil Stubbins signed a two-year coaching contract at the Jets. The club hoped that Stubbins&#x27; attacking mentality would bring success, along with a number of new signings, such as Argentinians Jeronimo Neumann and Marcos Flores, Australian international David Carney, and the club&#x27;s highest-ever goal scorer, Joel Griffiths. A poor start to the season saw CEO Robbie Middleby and chairman Ray Baartz resign from their positions during a mid-season break. On 10 January 2015, three days after Middleby and Baartz resigned, Newcastle owner Nathan Tinkler took the club off the market and was appointed chairman. On 29 January 2015, Newcastle players Kew Jaliens, Billy Celeski, Adrian Madaschi, David Carney and Joel Griffiths were released. Stubbins started rebuilding the club, bringing in imports Lee Ki-je and Enver Alivodic, along with signing defender Nigel Boogaard. The Jets ended the season at the bottom of the table with only three wins, making it their worst-ever season. On 21 May, Football Federation Australia terminated the club&#x27;s licence after the Jets failed to settle debts and pay problems.

On 21 May 2015, the FFA issued a licence for a new team in Newcastle, indicating that the new entity would continue to hold the Newcastle Jets&#x27; name and colours, and would continue to play its games at Hunter Stadium. All players, along with the administration staff, were issued new contracts. The coaching staff, however, underwent a performance review by FFA. Consequently, on 26 May, Phil Stubbins, along with fellow coaching staff Mark Jones, James Pascoe and Jess Vanstrattan, all had their contracts terminated by the FFA, which wanted a fresh start for the club. The FFA began the rebuilding process by setting up three forums: a business forum, a members&#x27; forum and a supporters&#x27; forum, so that fans could voice their opinions about the club&#x27;s restructuring. On 18 June 2015, the FFA appointed former Fulham assistant coach, Scott Miller as the club&#x27;s head coach. Former Melbourne Victory assistant coach, Jean-Paul de Marigny was appointed as Miller&#x27;s senior assistant.

On Thursday 10 September 2015, the club announced its new major sponsor, Inspirations Paint. Acting CEO, David Eland said, &quot;To get a brand like Inspirations Paint behind the club is absolutely fantastic. They are Australia&#x27;s largest and leading network of paint stores, founded here in 1979. I think it&#x27;s a sign that the community are starting to re-align with their club.&quot;

On Tuesday 14 June 2016, it was announced that the FFA had completed the sale of the club to the Ledman Group, a leading high-tech LED signage manufacturer, operator and sports business, headquartered in Shenzhen, China. The Ledman Group was valued at over one billion Australian dollars on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The Ledman Group was an official partner of the Chinese Super League and China League (Division Two), and had a strategic partnership with the Chinese Football Association.

In September 2016, Scott Miller was dismissed by the club. Later that month, the club announced that previous club assistant and fitness coach, Mark Jones, would take the reins for the 2016–17 season. However, his coaching tenure at Newcastle was brought to an end after a 2–0 away loss to Sydney FC, which saw the club receive their second wooden spoon in three seasons.

On Friday 30 September 2016, the club announced Inspirations Paint had re-signed as a Major Sponsor for a further year. Newcastle Jets Chief Executive Officer, Lawrie McKinna, announced the news recently at the launch of #TheJetsHouse opposite Hunter Stadium in Broadmeadow – a painted home which has been decked out in Jets colours and branding by the Inspirations Paint for the entirety of the club&#x27;s Hyundai A-League 2016/17 campaign.

===Merrick Era===
====2017–18 season====

On 9 May 2017, Ernie Merrick was named as Newcastle&#x27;s new coach for the next two A-League seasons after previously managing A-League teams Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix, managing a total of 241 A-League games, and winning the 2006–07, 2008–09 titles.

After the announcement Merrick stated:

Merrick&#x27;s first A-League match as coach was on 7 October 2017, against F3 Derby rivals Central Coast Mariners, with the Mariners having won the previous meeting 2–0 at home. Newcastle won the game 1–5, beating the Mariners by four goals and making it the largest F3 Derby victory. After Newcastle&#x27;s first game, they followed up by going five games undefeated, losing their first game of the season on 18 November 2017, to 2016–17 champions, Sydney FC in round 7. Between rounds 7 and 24 Newcastle achieved 10 wins, 3 draws, and 3 losses, before losing three games on the trot, scoring only two and conceding ten. In the last game of the regular season Newcastle again played F3 Derby rivals, Central Coast, playing them for a third time during the season. After three consecutive losses Newcastle made both A-League and F3 derby history, beating the Mariners 2–8, winning by the highest margin in the F3 derby, a feat they achieved in round 1 of the season. Playing in the highest scoring A-League match, winning all three F3 Derby matches during the 2017–18 season and finishing in second position and qualifying for the AFC Champions League for a second time. After one of the most successful regular seasons in Newcastle Jets history, manager Ernie Merrick signed on for a further season extending his contract to the end of the 2019–20 A-League season.

Newcastle played Melbourne City at home in the semi-final of the A-League finals, winning 2–1, with goals to Riley McGree and Jason Hoffman. Newcastle reached their second A-League Grand Final in history. Newcastle were defeated in the 2017–18 A-League Grand Final by Melbourne Victory, losing 1–0. Dimitri Petratos was named Newcastle Jets player of the season. After a very successful season in the A-League, Andrew Nabbout, a former Newcastle player, and Dimitri Petratos, Newcastle player of the season and joint golden boot winner for Newcastle, were named in the Australian squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Nabbout playing two of the three group stage matches (France, Denmark).

====2018–19 season====

Before the start of the 2018–19 A-League season, Newcastle signed New Zealand international Matthew Ridenton from fellow A-League club Wellington Phoenix on a free transfer which reunited him with former Phoenix boss Ernie Merrick. The Jets also announced the signings of Brazilian striker Jair Eduardo, former Melbourne Victory winger Mitch Austin, attacker Kaine Sheppard and goalkeeper Lewis Italiano prior to the start of the season.

Newcastle enjoyed their best ever run in the FFA Cup, beating Queensland side Gold Coast Knights 0–1 in the Round of 32. In the Round of 16, the Jets went down to fellow A-League side Melbourne City 0–1.

===2020–2024: Ownership uncertainty and managerial changes===

After a poor start to the season where the Jets only won 2 of their first 13 A-League matches and sat at the bottom of the table, Ernie Merrick was sacked as manager. Newcastle Jets Women coach Craig Deans and Qiang Li were named joint-caretaker managers the same day. On 6 February, former Vancouver Whitecaps manager Carl Robinson was named as the club&#x27;s new head coach signing a deal until the end of the 2022–23 season. The club won 4 of their first 7 league matches under Robinson&#x27;s stewardship, losing only once, before the FFA announced that the 2019–20 A-League season would be postponed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand on 24 March 2020.

Although the Jets results had improved under Robinson, he departed the club in October 2021 to assume the vacant managerial position at Western Sydney Wanderers. The timing of Robinson&#x27;s departure was not ideal for Newcastle who were close to commencing the 2020–21 season. Craig Deans subsequently returned for his third stint as interim manager.

On 4 January 2021, it was reported that the Jets&#x27; licence had been terminated and absentee owner Martin Lee, who had not injected any funds into the club since October 2019 and had failed to pay club debts, had been removed. The Jets were controlled for an interim period by investors from other A-League clubs, to whom a new licence was granted. Australian Professional Leagues commissioner Greg O&#x27;Rourke confirmed that the club could continue to play in A-League and W-League competitions despite the uncertainty.

After a positive start to the season, Deans was appointed as the full-time head coach on 9 February. However the Jets experienced a downturn in results, only winning a further two matches and narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon. Deans resigned on 2 June.

On 28 June 2021, Newcastle Jets appointed Arthur Papas as manager.

On 19 June 2023, Arthur Papas resigned as manager.

On 26 June 2023, Newcastle Jets announced the appointment of Rob Stanton as Head Coach of the A-League Men&#x27;s side for the next two seasons.

===2024-Present: Acquisition by Maverick Sports Partners===

On 11 June 2024, the Jets announced that Maverick Sports Partners would become the new owners of the club. The new owners, spearheaded by Executive Director Maurice Bisseto, brought stability to the club after years of ownership uncertainty.

The Jets began their new era in the Australia Cup, defeating Western United and Rockdale Ilinden, before being knocked out by eventual champions Macarthur in the Round of 16.

==Colours and badge==


===AFC Competition Sponsorship===
The club&#x27;s traditional colours are blue and red; colours also worn by the Newcastle Knights rugby league team in the region. When Newcastle joined the A-League the club changed its colours to a gold jersey with a navy and red trim and navy blue shorts and socks. The kit was markedly different to the jersey worn by the original NSL club which was almost exclusively red and blue. The away jersey was white with gold sleeves, gold shorts and white socks. The club&#x27;s jersey for the 2009–10 season retained the home kit design, however, the away strip revert to something more historic, in light of the club&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The jersey featured blue and red, with white and blue shorts and socks, in line with the old Newcastle United strips. In early 2011, the new Tinkler Sports Group revealed that Newcastle&#x27;s colours would revert to the blue and red worn by Newcastle United. The decision was also made to combined colours with the Newcastle Knights who became a cousin club due to the shared ownership. The 2011–12 season away kit was revealed to be a black and white, with the same stripped design of the home kit. The Jets wore the black and white kit until the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. It was after the conclusion of that season when it was announced that Newcastle Jets members would vote for the sides new away kit. The first of three options was an emerald jersey with a brown and white stripe going diagonally across the shirt, based on KB United, a team that represented Newcastle in the NSL. The second was a white jersey that featured red down the sides, and blue on the back at the base of the shirt. The final option was a dark grey jersey, with a red and blue diagonal stripe, the same design as the first option. After members chose the emerald green jersey, the club revealed a new home kit. Similar to the home shirt from the previous two seasons, the red and blue stripes became slightly thinner, featuring five stripes on the front of the jersey, opposed to three stripes on the former kit. The stripes were largely replaced on the back of the shirt with a solid blue, yet stripes still featured at the bottom. The three jets from the club&#x27;s crest were also added to the back of both the home and away kits, located just underneath the neck.

A simple blue and red logo with the name &quot;Newcastle United&quot; was used during the club&#x27;s time in the NSL. After joining the A-League, a new logo was designed to incorporate the new name &quot;Newcastle United Jets&quot;. The name change was done so to project a new image for the club and to prevent confusion with the English side Newcastle United The name &quot;Jets&quot; is a reference to RAAF Base Williamtown, located just 20 kilometres north of Newcastle. The club&#x27;s logo also depicts three F/A-18 Hornets, which the Royal Australian Air Force had based at Williamtown.

==Stadium==

McDonald Jones Stadium, at the Newcastle International Sports Centre, is the home ground of the Newcastle Jets and is the home of the Newcastle Knights. It has a capacity of 33,000. The stadium is located in the suburb of Broadmeadow.

The record crowd for a soccer match in Newcastle was set at Ausgrid Stadium on 2 February 2007 in the second leg of the 2006-07 A-League minor semi final against Sydney FC, in front of 24,338 people. This broke the record set earlier that season on New Years Day, where a crowd of 20,980 turned up to see a 2–0 loss against the same opposition. Prior to that game the soccer attendance record for a match in Newcastle stood for 52 years, set when Australia played Rapid Vienna.

This upgrade is a result of Australia gaining rights to hold the finals of the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia between 4 and 26 January 2015. Newcastle may be one of the venues for this event, and minimum standards set by FIFA mean EAS is inadequate for this role. The newest upgrade involved demolishing the western grandstand and replacing it with one similar to the east, as well as placing seated areas on the hill at either end of the ground. This upgrade cost around $60 million, of which $50 million was provided by the State Government. This upgrade means the Jets attendance figures can grow immensely, and will also qualify the Jets to host any Grand Finals they reach in the future.

==Supporters==
The main active supporter group of the Newcastle Jets were the Squadron Novocastria, which was formed in anticipation of the first ever A-League game between Newcastle and Adelaide United. The Squadron began standing behind the goals on the Southern Hill, however because of the layout of the stadium and FFA regulations requiring them to be located in a fully seated area, they moved to Bay 2 of the Eastern Grandstand at McDonald Jones Stadium. Standard songs/chants include, &quot;We go by land and sea&quot;, &quot;The Newy Boys go one by one&quot; and &quot;When The Jets Go Flying In&quot;. The Squadron have also started a new tradition of singing the chorus to the INXS song &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; before the start of the game and second half. As the club&#x27;s performances improved throughout the 2006–07 season the Squadron grew rapidly and continued to grow throughout the 2007–08 season.

In the interest of increasing active support participation during the 2013–14 Season, and after months of negotiation with club, stadium and security, the Squadron initiated a move from their Bay 2 location, to the other side of the stadium in Bay 60. This took effect for the first time for the visit of the Western Sydney Wanderers on 31 January 2014. &quot;The Newcastle Herald&quot; reported that this was to avoid clashes with opposition fans.

Before the start of the 2014–15 Season the Squadron threatened to boycott the designated active supporter bay due to measures introduced by the FFA, which meant that the area would be a &quot;members only&quot; area. The Squadron believed this would adversely affect the large demographic of young people regularly joining the Squadron, along with other issues. However through negotiation with the club the Squadron ensured that all fans, members or not were able to join the Squadron on matchday and so the boycott was avoided. For the 2016–17 A-League season, the Squadron, with financial support from the Jets, moved to the southern end of McDonald Jones Stadium in a bid to improve active support at home games.

In late 2016, a new supporter group, the Newcastle City Legionaries (NCL) was formed by previous founders of the Squadron. The group sits in Bay 1, a general admission bay of McDonald Jones Stadium, and aims to be a &quot;traditional&quot; supporter group, by engaging in &quot;English style&quot; active support (i.e. no capo, and anybody can start chants). The group has received praise from Lawrie McKinna, who credited the group with engaging with the crowd, and creating a great atmosphere.

On 22 April 2017, the Squadron announced that they would be ceasing active support, due to harsh FFA restrictions regarding active support. Although the Squadron resumed active support during the 2017–18 season, declining attendances and poor on-field performances the following season resulted in the group dissolving once more.

==Rivalries==
Due to its geographical proximity, Newcastle shares a strong rivalry with Central Coast Mariners. Known as The F3 Derby, the first meeting between the teams resulted in a tough semi-final tie in the 2005 Oceania Club Championship qualification competition (held in May 2005, prior to the start of the inaugural A-League season), when star Mariners striker Nik Mrdja broke the leg of Newcastle defender Andrew Durante, earning him a tag as Newcastle&#x27;s &quot;hate-boy&quot;. In the 2007–08 season, Newcastle Jets beat the Mariners 2–0 in the first leg of the Major Semi-Final, before being beaten 3–0 in extra time in the second leg at Bluetongue Stadium. After beating Queensland Roar 3–2 in the Preliminary Final, the Jets then went on to defeat the Mariners 1–0 in the 2007/08 A-League Grand Final. In round 17 of the 2008/09 season, the Jets and Mariners faced each other at Ausgrid Stadium. The Mariners won the game 2–1 courtesy of a Matt Simon goal in the 80th minute. After the full-time whistle, star Jets striker Joel Griffiths grabbed Mariners midfielder John Hutchinson around the neck causing players from both sides to intervene. Referee Peter O&#x27;Leary sent off Mariners&#x27; striker Dylan Macallister for abusive language.

==Emerging Jets Academy==
The Emerging Jets program is underpinned by a tri-party agreement between the National Body (Football Federation Australia), the Member Federation (Northern New South Wales Football Federation) and the local A-League club (Newcastle Jets). The integrated talented player pathway by definition provides a succinct and clearly discernible development program for players from as young as eight years to the National Youth League, A-League and W-League.

In January 2015 the Emerging Jets Program moved to the Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility. For the first time since its inauguration the Emerging Jets have a home base for their training and fixtures. The Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility has also been the home of Northern NSW Football since late 2014.

The program is designed to provide players with the opportunity to develop their skills through access to quality coaching, competitive opportunities and support services.

The program aims to provide identified players and coaches with the opportunity to reach their full potential. The parties also have the aspiration to develop players who have the ability to showcase the region in the world&#x27;s biggest leagues and inspire future generations of grassroots players and Emerging Jets players.

<text>The Marne (; ) is a river in France, an eastern tributary of the Seine in the area east and southeast of Paris. It is long. The river gave its name to the departments of Haute-Marne, Marne, Seine-et-Marne, and Val-de-Marne.

The Marne starts in the Langres plateau, runs generally north then bends west between Saint-Dizier and Châlons-en-Champagne, joining the Seine at Charenton just upstream from Paris. Its main tributaries are the Rognon, the Blaise, the Saulx, the Ourcq, the Petit Morin and the Grand Morin.

Near the town of Saint-Dizier, part of the flow is diverted through the artificial Lake Der-Chantecoq. This ensures both flood prevention and the maintenance of minimum river flows in periods of drought.

The Marne is famous as the site of two eponymous battles during World War I. The first battle was a turning point of the war, fought in 1914. The second battle was fought four years later, in 1918.

== History ==
The Celts of Gaul worshipped a goddess known as Dea Matrona (&quot;divine mother goddess&quot;) who was associated with the Marne.

The Marne was navigable as a free-flowing river until the 19th century. It had one gated 500 m shortcut, the Canal de Cornillon in Meaux, which was built in 1235, the oldest canal in France. Canalisation was started in 1837 and completed to Épernay in 1867. It included a number of canals to bypass the most extravagant meanders.

In World War I, the Marne was the scene of two notable battles. In the First Battle of the Marne (September 1914), the military governor of Paris, General Joseph Gallieni, took the initiative in driving the Germans back from the capital, rendering their war-plan inoperative. In the Second Battle of the Marne (July-August 1918), the last major German offensive on the Western Front was defeated by an Allied counter-attack, leading eventually to the Armistice.

== Navigation ==
During the heyday of canal transportation, the Marne was a major artery connecting Paris and the Seine with major rivers to the east: the Meuse (via the Canal de l&#x27;Aisne à la Marne and the Canal des Ardennes), the Moselle and the Rhine (via the Marne-Rhine Canal), and the Saône and Rhône (via the Canal de la Marne à la Saône). To facilitate transportation along the Marne itself, a number of lateral canals were constructed alongside. The most extensive was the Canal latéral à la Marne, which runs between Vitry-le-François and Dizy. Downstream of this were several more, including the Canal de Meaux à Chalifert, the Canal de Chelles, and the Canal de Saint-Maurice which ended at Charenton-le-Pont near the Marne&#x27;s confluence with the Seine. Furthermore, a portion of the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq also runs parallel and quite close to the Marne before swinging away to enter Paris from the north; at one time the two were linked by a &quot;tub-boat&quot; inclined plane near Meaux.

<text>The Dahlak Archipelago is an Eritrean island group located in the Red Sea, measuring around 643 square km (248 square miles) and lying roughly 58 kilometers (31 nautical miles, 36 miles) east of Massawa, the regional capital city.

== Etymology ==
==History==

G.W.B. Huntingford has identified with the Dahlak archipelago a group of islands near Adulis called &quot;Alalaiou&quot; in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; which were a source of tortoise shell. According to Edward Ullendorff, the Dahlak islanders were amongst the first people in the Horn of Africa to embrace Islam, and a number of tombstones in Kufic script attest to this early connection.

In the 7th century, the Sultanate of Dahlak emerged in the archipelago. However, it was subsequently conquered by Yemen, then by the Ethiopian Empire. In 1517 the Ottoman Turks conquered the islands and placed them under the rule of the Pasha at Suakin as part of the province of Habesh. By 1526 the Dahalik sultan, Ahmad, had been degraded to a tributary. There was a short revival of the sultanate during the Abyssinian-Adal war, where the sultanate of Adal waged a temporarily successful jihad with the help of cannons and guns from the Ottomans against the Ethiopian Empire. Sultan Ahmad joined the Adal Empire and was rewarded with the port town of Arkiko, which before the war had belonged to Medri Bahri. However, in 1541, one year after the death of sultan Ahmad, the Portuguese returned and destroyed Dahlak yet again. Sixteen years later, the islands were occupied by the Ottoman Empire again, who made them part of the Habesh Eyalet.

The Italian colony of Eritrea, formed in 1890, included the archipelago. However, during this time the islands were home to little except the Nocra prison camp operated by the Italian colonial forces.

After Ethiopia allied itself with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, following the rise of the Derg, the Dahlak Archipelago was the location of a Soviet Navy base. In 1990, Ethiopia lost control of the Dahlak Archipelago and the northern Eritrean coast to the Eritrean independence movement (EPLF) and by 1991 Ethiopia had lost control of all of Eritrea. Following the international recognition of Eritrean independence in 1993, the Dahlak Archipelago became a part of Eritrea.

==Geography==
Consisting of two larger and 124 smaller islands, only three of the islands are permanently inhabited, with Dahlak Kebir being the largest and most populated. Other islands of the archipelago are Dhuladhiya, Dissei, Dohul (Dehil), Erwa, Harat, Harmil, Inghel, Isra-Tu, Nahaleg, Nakura, Nora (Norah) and Shumma.

===Demography===
Besides Dahlak Kebir, only Nora and Dohul are permanently inhabited. Residents of the archipelago speak Dahlik and maintain a traditional way of life, including fishing, shepherding and raising camels. The local pearl fisheries of the archipelago have been famous since Roman times, and still produce a substantial number of pearls.

===Access===
Tourism is increasing. The islands can be reached by boat from Massawa and are popular with scuba divers and snorkellers.

==Environment==
The islands and surrounding seas, with their coral reefs and shoals, are rich in marine life, including seabirds and waders. Some islands are fringed with mangroves and others with salt brush scrub. Dolphins, dugongs, sharks, and turtles can be seen as well as a variety of invertebrates.

===Important Bird Area===
The archipelago has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of spotted sandgrouse, white-eyed gulls, lesser crested terns, lesser kestrels, sooty falcons, greater hoopoe-larks, blackstarts and cinereous buntings.

<text>The Anfal campaign was a counterinsurgency operation which was carried out by Ba&#x27;athist Iraq from February to September 1988 during the Iraqi–Kurdish conflict at the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The campaign targeted rural Kurds because its purpose was to eliminate Kurdish rebel groups and Arabize strategic parts of the Kirkuk Governorate. The Ba&#x27;athist regime committed atrocities on the local Kurdish population, mostly civilians.

The Iraqi forces were led by Ali Hassan al-Majid, on the orders of President Saddam Hussein. The campaign&#x27;s name was taken from the title of the eighth chapter of the Qur&#x27;an (&quot;al-ʾanfāl&quot;).

In 1993, Human Rights Watch released a report on the Anfal campaign based on documents captured by Kurdish rebels during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq; HRW described it as a genocide and estimated between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths. This characterization of the Anfal campaign was disputed by a 2007 Hague court ruling, which stated that the evidences from the documents were not sufficient to establish the charge of genocide. Although many Iraqi Arabs reject that there were any mass killings of Kurdish civilians during Anfal, the event is an important element constituting Kurdish national identity.

==Background==
Following the Iraqi invasion of Iran in 1980, the rival Kurdish opposition parties in Iraq—the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) as well as other smaller Kurdish parties—experienced a revival in their fortunes. Kurdish fighters (peshmerga) fought a guerrilla war against the Iraqi government and established effective control over the Kurdish-inhabited mountainous areas of northern Iraq. As the war went on and Iran counterattacked into Iraq, the peshmerga gained ground in most Kurdish-inhabited rural areas while also infiltrating towns and cities. In 1983, after the joint KDP-Iranian capture of Haj Omran, the Iraqi government arrested 8,000 Barzani men and executed them. During the battle for Haj Omran, the Iraqi government also used gas weapons for the first time against both Kurdish and Iranian forces.

== Name ==
&quot;Al Anfal&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the spoils (of war)&quot;, was used to describe the military campaign of extermination and looting against the Kurds. It is also the title of the eighth sura, or chapter, of the Qur&#x27;an which describes the victory of 313 followers of the new Muslim faith over almost 900 non-Muslims at the Battle of Badr in 624 AD. According to Randal, &quot;Jash&quot; (Kurdish collaborators with the Baathists) were told that taking cattle, sheep, goats, money, weapons and even women was &quot;halal&quot; (religiously permitted or legal).

== Summary ==
The Anfal campaign began in February 1988 and continued until August or September and included the use of ground offensives, aerial bombing, chemical warfare, systematic destruction of settlements, mass deportation and firing squads. The campaign was headed by Ali Hassan al-Majid who was a cousin of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from Saddam&#x27;s hometown of Tikrit.

The Iraqi Army was supported by Kurdish collaborators whom the Iraqi government armed, the so-called &quot;Jash&quot; forces, who led Iraqi troops to Kurdish villages that often did not figure on maps as well as to their hideouts in the mountains. The &quot;Jash&quot; forces frequently made false promises of amnesty and safe passage. Iraqi state media extensively covered the &quot;Anfal&quot; campaign using its official name. Approximately 1,200 Kurdish villages were destroyed during the &quot;Anfal&quot; campaign. To many Iraqis, &quot;Anfal&quot; was presented as an extension of the ongoing Iran–Iraq War, although its victims were overwhelmingly Kurdish civilians.

== Campaign ==
In March 1987, Ali Hassan al-Majid was appointed secretary-general of the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Northern Bureau, which included Iraqi Kurdistan.
=== Military operations and chemical attacks ===
Anfal, officially conducted in 1988, had eight phases (Anfal 1–Anfal 8) altogether, seven of which targeted areas controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Kurdish Democratic Party-controlled areas in the northwest Iraqi Kurdistan, were the target of the Final Anfal operation in late August and early September 1988.

==== Anfal 1 ====

The first Anfal stage was conducted between 23 February and 18 March 1988. It started with artillery and air strikes in the early hours of 23 February 1988. Then, several hours later, there were attacks at the Jafali Valley headquarters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan near the Iranian border, and the command centers in Sargallu and Bargallu. There was heavy resistance by the Peshmerga. The battles were conducted in a theater around 1,154 square kilometres (445 sq. mi.). The villages of Gwezeela, Chalawi, Haladin and Yakhsamar were attacked with poison gas. During mid March, the PUK, in an alliance with Iranian troops and other Kurdish factions, captured Halabja. This led to the poison gas attack on Halabja on 16 March 1988, during which several thousand Kurdish people were killed, most of them civilians.

==== Anfal 2 ====
During the second Anfal from 22 March and 2 April 1988, the Qara Dagh region, including Bazian and Darbandikhan, was targeted in the Suleimanya governorate. Again several villages were attacked with poison gas. Villages attacked with poisonous gas were Safaran, Sewsenan, Belekjar, Serko and Meyoo. The attacks began on 22 March after Newruz, surprising the Peshmerga. Although of shorter duration, Peshmerga suffered more severe casualties in this attack than the first Anfal. As a result of the attack, the majority of the population in the Qara Dagh region fled in the direction of Suleimanya. Many fugitives were detained by the Iraqi forces, and the men were separated from the women. The men were not seen again. The women were transported to camps. The population that managed to flee, fled to the Garmia region.

==== Anfal 3 ====
In the next Anfal campaign from 7 to 20 April 1988, the Garmian region east of Suleimanya was targeted. In this campaign, many women and children disappeared. The only village attacked with chemical weapons was Tazashar. Many were lured to come towards the Iraqi forces due to an amnesty announced through a loudspeaker of a mosque in Qader Karam from 10 to 12 April. The announced amnesty was a trap, and many who surrendered were detained. Some civilians were able to bribe Kurdish collaborators of the Iraqi Army and fled to Laylan or Shorsh. Before the Anfal campaign, the mainly rural Garmian region counted over 600 villages around the towns of Kifri, Kalar and Darbandikhan.

==== Anfal 4 ====
Anfal 4 took place between 3–8 May 1988 in the valley of the Little Zab, which forms the border of the provinces of Erbil and Kirkuk. The morale of the Iraqi army was on the rise due to the capture of the Faw Peninsula on the 17–18 April 1988 from Iran in the Iran–Iraq War. Major poisonous gas attacks were perpetrated in Askar and Goptapa. Again it was announced an amnesty was issued, which turned out to be false. Many of the ones who surrendered were arrested. Men were separated from the women.

==== Anfal 5, 6 and 7 ====
In these three consecutive attacks between 15 May and 16 August 1988, the valleys of Rawandiz and Shaqlawa were targeted, and the attacks had different successes. The Anfal 5 failed completely; therefore, two more attacks were necessary to gain Iraqi government control over the valleys. The Peshmerga commander of the region, Kosrat Abdullah, was well prepared for a long siege with stores of ammunition and food. He also reached an agreement with the Kurdish collaborators of the Iraqi Army so that the civilians could flee. Hiran, Balisan, Smaquli, Malakan, Shek Wasan, Ware, Seran and Kaniba were attacked with poisonous gas. After the Anfal 7 attack, the valleys were under the control of the Iraqi government.

==== Anfal 8 ====
The last Anfal was aimed at the region controlled by the KDP named Badinan and took place from 25 August to 6 September 1988. In this campaign, the villages of Wirmeli, Barkavreh, Bilejane, Glenaska, Zewa Shkan, Tuka and Ikmala were targeted with chemical attacks. After tens of thousands of Kurds fled to Turkey, the Iraqi Army blocked the route to Turkey on 26 August 1988. The population who did not manage to flee was arrested, and the men were separated from the women and children. The men were executed, and the women and children were brought to camps.

=== Detention camps ===
Detention camps were established to accommodate thousands of prisoners. Dibs was a detention camp for women and children and located near an army training facility for the Iraqi commando forces. From Dibs, groups of detainees were transferred to Nugra Salman in a depression in the desert about 120 km southwest of Samawah, in the Muthanna Governorate. Nugra Salman held an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 prisoners during the Anfal campaign. Another detention camp was Topzawa near an army base near the highway leading out of Kirkuk.

=== Arabization ===
Arabization, another major element of al-Anfal, was a tactic used by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime to drive pro-insurgent populations out of their homes in villages and cities like Kirkuk, which are in the valuable oil field areas, and relocate them in the southern parts of Iraq. The campaign used heavy population redistribution, most notably in Kirkuk, the results of which now plague negotiations between Iraq&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a United Iraqi Alliance and the Kurdish Kurdistani Alliance. Saddam&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist regime built several public housing facilities in Kirkuk as part of his &quot;Arabisation&quot;, shifting poor Arabs from Iraq&#x27;s southern regions to Kirkuk with the lure of inexpensive housing. Another part of the Arabisation campaign was the census of October 1987. Citizens who failed to turn up for the October 1987 census were no longer recognized as Iraqi citizens. Most of the Kurdish population who learned that a census was taking place did not take part in the census.

==Death toll==
Precise figures of Anfal victims do not exist due to lack of records. In its 1993 report, Human Rights Watch wrote that the death toll &quot;cannot conceivably be less than 50,000, and it may well be twice that number&quot;. This figure was based on an earlier survey by the Sulaymaniyah–based Kurdish organization Committee for the Defence of Anfal Victims&#x27; Rights. According to HRW, Kurdish leaders met with Iraqi government official Ali Hassan al-Majid in 1991 and mentioned a figure of 182,000 deaths; the latter reportedly replied that &quot;it couldn&#x27;t have been more than 100,000&quot;. The 182,000 figure provided by the PUK was based on extrapolation and &quot;has no empirical relation to actual disappearances or killings&quot;, though it &quot;has assumed mythical status among Kurds&quot;. In 1995, the Committee for the Defence of Anfal Victims&#x27; Rights released a report documenting 63,000 disappeared and stating that the entire death toll was lower than 70,000, with almost all these deaths occurring in the area of Anfal III. According to Hiltermann, the figure of 100,000, although considered too low by many Kurds, is probably higher than the actual number of deaths.

== Aftermath ==
In September 1988, the Iraqi government was satisfied with its achievements. The male population between 15 and 50 had either been killed or fled. The Kurdish resistance fled to Iran and was no longer a threat to Iraq. An amnesty was issued, and the detained women, children and elderly were released but not permitted to return. They were sent into camps known as &quot;mujamm&#x27;at&quot; where they lived under military rule until a regional autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan was achieved in 1991. Following, most survivors returned, and began to reconstruct the villages. In Kurdish society, the Anfal survivors are known as Anfal mothers (Kurdish: &quot;Daykan-î Enfal)&quot;, Anfal relatives (Kurdish: &quot;Kes-u-kar-î Enfal)&quot; or Anfal widows (Kurdish: &quot;Bewajin-î Enfal)&quot;.

== Trials ==
Human Rights Watch unsuccessfully attempted to attract support for a lawsuit under the Genocide Convention against Iraq at the International Court of Justice. It convinced the United States Department of State&#x27;s legal bureau that Anfal met the legal criteria for genocide.

=== Frans van Anraat ===
In December 2005, a court in The Hague convicted Frans van Anraat of complicity in war crimes for his role in selling chemical weapons to the Iraqi government. He was given a 15-year sentence. The court also ruled that the killing of thousands of Kurds in Iraq in the 1980s was indeed an act of genocide. In the 1948 Genocide Convention, the definition of genocide is &quot;acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group&quot;. The Dutch court said that it was considered &quot;legally and convincingly proven that the Kurdish population meets the requirement under the Genocide Conventions as an ethnic group. The court has no other conclusion than that these attacks were committed with the intent to destroy the Kurdish population of Iraq&quot;.

During another trial involving the legal appeal of Van Anraat, The Hague appellate court upheld the previous conviction of his complicity in war crimes; but ruled that actions of Iraqi military during Anfal operations cannot be regarded as constituting a &quot;genocide&quot;. The verdict of the Hague Court of Appeal stated in 9 May 2007 that tons of Iraqi documents collected by US government, based on which the Human Rights Watch produced its reports, were not enough to establish &quot;a sufficient degree of certainty for a finding of fact in respect of genocide can be derived&quot;.

=== Saddam Hussein ===

In an interview broadcast on Iraqi television on 6 September 2005, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurdish politician of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said that judges had directly extracted confessions from Saddam Hussein that he had ordered mass killings and other crimes during his regime and that he deserves to die. Two days later, Saddam&#x27;s lawyer denied that he had confessed.

=== Anfal trial ===
In June 2006, the Iraqi Special Tribunal announced that Saddam Hussein and six co-defendants would face trial on 21 August 2006 in relation to the Anfal campaign. In December 2006, Saddam was put on trial for the genocide during Operation Anfal. The trial for the Anfal campaign was still underway on 30 December 2006, when Saddam Hussein was executed for his role in the unrelated Dujail massacre.

The Anfal trial recessed on 21 December 2006, and when it resumed on 8 January 2007, the remaining charges against Saddam Hussein were dropped. Six co-defendants continued to stand trial for their roles in the Anfal campaign. On 23 June 2007, Ali Hassan al-Majid, and two co-defendants, Sultan Hashem Ahmed and Hussein Rashid Mohammed, were convicted of genocide and related charges and sentenced to death by hanging. Another two co-defendants (Farhan Jubouri and Saber Abdel Aziz al-Douri) were sentenced to life imprisonment, and one (Taher Tawfiq al-Ani) was acquitted on the prosecution&#x27;s demand.

Al-Majid was charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He was convicted in June 2007 and was sentenced to death. His appeal for the death sentence was rejected on 4 September 2007. He was sentenced to death for the fourth time on 17 January 2010 and was hanged eight days later, on 25 January 2010. Sultan Hashem Ahmed was not hanged due to opposition of the Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who opposed capital punishment.

The Anfal trial was widely criticized for its methodical defects marked by various acts of political meddling from the Iraqi government. These involved the sacking of its presiding judge in September 2006 by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki; who perceived the judge as biased towards defendants. Human Rights Watch stated that many of the charges were &quot;vague&quot; and concluded that the defendants were unable to bring their witnesses due to safety issues within Iraq. Video interactions from witnesses of the defendants were also denied by the court; thus hampering the defendants&#x27; ability to challenge the claims of the prosecutors. The trial was marked by absence of fundamental judicial proceedings, such as the murder of three defense lawyers and ample utilization of anonymous witnesses by the prosecution; whose claims couldn&#x27;t be cross-analyzed by the defendants. Both within and outside Iraq, the trials by the Special Tribunal have been widely dubbed as a &quot;show parade&quot; designed to execute Saddam and deemed as illegitimate by numerous lawyers and human rights organizations.

== Sources ==
There have been few publications about the Anfal campaign and as of 2008, the only comprehensive account of it is that which was published by HRW. Human Rights Watch&#x27;s 1993 report on Anfal was based on Iraqi documents, examination of grave sites, and interviews with Kurdish survivors.

In 1993, the United States government collected 18 tons of Iraqi government documents which were captured by the Peshmerga during the 1991 uprising and airlifted them to the United States. In those files, HRW conducted research on the Anfal campaign in collaboration with United States federal government agencies such as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Department. The US government provided Arabic translators and CD ROM scanners. HRW accepted the US government role under the condition that personnel involved worked under its direction. The files include documents which were collected by the Kurdish parties PUK and KDP, both parties hold the ultimate ownership of the documents that were airlifted to the US.
In exchange for access to the National Archives documents, HRW agreed to help the United States government find information about Iraqi atrocities. Joost Hiltermann, HRW&#x27;s lead researcher on Anfal, referred to these files as &quot;the good stuff…material to smear the enemy with&quot;. Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi–American academic and pro-Iraq War advocate, criticized HRW for promising that the records proved genocide. He warned that the records contained neither &quot;smoking guns&quot; nor do they contain records of the &quot;explosive nature&quot; as HRW claimed. Furthermore, he said that certain documents that seemed incriminating could have been planted by Kurdish rebels. After the invasion of Iraq, Makiya said in December 2003 that the Iraqi document archives contained no &quot;smoking gun&quot; to convict Saddam Hussein of war crimes.

After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, mass graves were discovered in parts of western Iraq that had been under Ba&#x27;athist control.

== Legacy ==
The event has become an important element in the constitution of Kurdish national identity. The Kurdistan Regional Government has set aside 14 April as a day of remembrance for the Al-Anfal campaign. In Sulaymanya a museum was established in the former prison of the Directorate of General Security. Many Iraqi Arabs reject that any mass killings of Kurds occurred during the Anfal campaign.

On 28 February 2013, the British House of Commons formally recognized the Anfal as genocide following a campaign which was led by Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who is of Kurdish descent.

<text>George Gaynes (born George Jongejans; May 16, 1917 – February 15, 2016) was a Dutch-American singer, actor, and voice artist. Born to Dutch and Russian-Finnish parents in the Grand Duchy of Finland of the Russian Empire, he served in the Royal Netherlands Navy during World War II, and subsequently emigrated to the United States, where he became a citizen and began his acting career on Broadway.

Gaynes&#x27; most recognized roles in cinema were that of Commandant Eric Lassard in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; series and as John Van Horn in the 1982 comedy film &quot;Tootsie&quot;. He appeared as the curmudgeonly but lovable foster parent Henry Warnimont on the NBC series &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;; as high-powered theatrical producer Arthur Feldman on &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;; as Senator Strobe Smithers in the hit TV show &quot;Hearts Afire&quot;; and as Frank Smith, the mob boss brought down by Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) and Laura Spencer (Genie Francis) on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Early life==
Gaynes was born on May 16, 1917, in Helsinki, in what was then the Grand Duchy of Finland, part of the Russian Empire (Finland became independent that year), the son of Iya Grigorievna de Gay (later known as Lady Abdy), a Russian artist of Finnish descent, and Gerrit Jongejans, a Dutch businessman. His uncle was the actor Gregory Gaye. He was raised in France, England, and Switzerland.

Gaynes graduated from the Collège Classique Cantonal near Lausanne in 1937. He also attended the Music School of Milan from 1938 to 1939, and many many years later trained at the Actors Studio in New York City from 1953 to 1958.

==World War II==
In 1940, Gaynes lived in France, but after the Battle of France and the German occupation, he escaped to the Pyrenees, but was soon arrested by the Francoist Spain police. In 1942 after his release, Gaynes intended to return to the Netherlands to join the Dutch resistance against the Nazi occupation, but instead made his way to the United Kingdom to enlist in the Royal Dutch Navy. On April 8, 1943, Gaynes was commissioned as a seaman recruit and assigned to the auxiliary ship HNLMS &quot;Oranje Nassau&quot;, which was stationed at Holyhead in Wales. Because of his multilingualism (he spoke Dutch, English, French, Italian, and Russian), he was detached on May 1, 1943, to the Royal Navy as a translator assigned to the convoy commodore aboard , which participated during July and August 1943 in Operation Husky the Allied invasion of Sicily. On September 1, 1943, Gaynes was reassigned to the destroyer , which participated during January 1944 in the Battle of Anzio. On January 1, 1944, he was promoted to sergeant (petty officer, 1st class). After the Battle of Anzio, HMS &quot;Wilton&quot; was assigned to the Adriatic Sea and continued to see action during the Adriatic Campaign. On July 14, 1946, Gaynes was honorably discharged from the Royal Dutch Navy.

==Career==
In 1946, Gaynes returned to France, but an American theater director offered him a role in a Broadway musical and he moved to New York City later that year and became an American citizen in 1948. During this time, his best-known appearances were in &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, the musical version of &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;. Gaynes alternated between stage musicals and both comedic and dramatic plays, including his role as Bob Baker in the original production of &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953), Jupiter in the Cole Porter musical &quot;Out of This World&quot; (credited as George Jongejans), Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and as Henry Higgins in the 1964 U.S. tour of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

Entering films and television in the early 1960s, Gaynes was a regular on the TV daytime dramas &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (replacing Robert Mandan in the role of Jo&#x27;s husband, Sam Reynolds) and &quot;General Hospital&quot; (originating the role of mobster Frank Smith), and showed up in such movies as &quot;The Group&quot; (1966), &quot;Marooned&quot; (1969), and &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Wives&quot; (1971). He also appeared in the films &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; (1976), and &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982). In 1984, he played Commandant Lassard, the titular leader, in the first of seven &quot;Police Academy&quot; movies. In 1994, he played Serybryalzov in Louis Malle&#x27;s acclaimed independent feature, &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot;. Later film appearances include &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996), &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997) and &quot;Just Married&quot; (2003).

On television, Gaynes played the role of Henry Warnimont, the eventual foster father for &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; in the &quot;eponymous series&quot; from 1984-1988. He also provided the voice for Henry in the &quot;animated version&quot; of the show. He appeared as high-powered theatrical producer Arthur Feldman on &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;, in which Gaynes&#x27; real-life wife, Allyn Ann McLerie, co-starred as his love interest, and as Senator Strobe Smithers in the hit TV show &quot;Hearts Afire&quot;. He also appeared in one episode of the sci-fi television series &quot;Sliders&quot; as the old-aged version of Quinn Mallory, played by Jerry O&#x27;Connell. Behind the camera, he directed the last episode of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; in 1982.

==Personal life and death==
Gaynes was married to stage and television actress and dancer Allyn Ann McLerie from December 20, 1953, until his death; they had two children, Matthew Gaynes and Iya Gaynes Falcone Brown. Matthew was shortlisted for the US Olympic kayak team the year that President Jimmy Carter boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Matthew died in a car crash in India in 1989 on his way to Nepal to film a kayaking special for ESPN.

In addition to Gaynes joining the cast of his wife&#x27;s series &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot; in 1989, McLerie and he had previously worked together on &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, when she guest-starred in a first-season episode.

Gaynes died at his daughter&#x27;s home in North Bend, Washington, on February 15, 2016, at the age of 98.

<doc id="802368" wikidata="Q5331055" url="?curid=802368" title="Easy-Bake Oven">
<text>The Easy-Bake Oven is a working toy oven introduced in 1963 and manufactured by Kenner and later by Hasbro. The original toy used a pair of ordinary incandescent light bulbs as a heat source; current versions use a true heating element. Kenner sold 500,000 Easy-Bake Ovens in the first year of production. By 1997, more than 16 million Easy-Bake Ovens had been sold. 

The oven comes with packets of cake mix and small round pans. Additional mixes can be purchased separately. After water is added to the mix in the pan, it is pushed into the oven through a slot. After cooking, the cake is pushed out through a slot in the other end.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Miniature stoves and ovens had existed in the late 19th to early 20th century, with many being copies of full-size stoves. To appeal to girls, toy train-maker Lionel Corporation released a toy stove with two electric burners and a working oven in 1930. During the 1950s, various toy ovens with fiberglass insulation were marketed to families with children.

=== Kenner versions ===
The Easy-Bake Oven was introduced in 1963 by Kenner Products, a Cincinnati, Ohio-based toy company. The idea for the Easy Bake Oven came from Norman Shapiro, Kenner&#x27;s sales manager in New York. He was inspired by the ovens that New York street vendors used to bake pretzels, and suggested to Kenner executives that the company makes a toy version of the appliance. Spearheaded by research and development vice-president James Kuhn, with major contributions from Ronald Howes, the Kenner team iterated on the idea. The original Kenner Easy-Bake Oven was heated by two 100-watt incandescent light bulbs, one above the food tray and one below. The idea was that the cake would bake more quickly and evenly if heated from both sides. Later models used only one bulb, leveraging convection from better interior heating dynamics to achieve the same results.

The original oven came in a pale yellow or turquoise, and was designed to resemble a conventional oven. The design changed many times over the years. An updated &quot;Premier&quot; model, available in avocado green (common shade for kitchen appliances at the time, now almost a cultural cliché) or red, was released in 1969, followed by a &quot;Mod&quot; model in yellow or light green in 1971. A more recent model resembled a microwave oven.
A one-of-a-kind model was presented to the winner of the 5,000,000th Easy-Bake Oven Sweepstakes in 1972.

Kenner licensed the Easy-Bake Oven to international markets. Japan represented a significant opportunity for Kenner. The toy oven was licensed to Nakajima Corporation, which sold its version as Margaret&#x27;s Cooking Oven.

=== Hasbro versions ===
After Kenner became a division of Hasbro, which then closed it down, Hasbro continued to produce the oven. The Easy-Bake Oven and Snack Center was introduced in 1993.

A decade after the Easy-Bake Oven and Snack Center was introduced, the Real Meal Oven was released. This oven was different from the others in being able to cook larger portions, and two of them at once, using two pans at the same time. It won the 2003 Best Toy &quot;Parenting&quot; magazine Toy of the Year Award. The neutral colors were more accepted across gender lines, and were favored by parents, particularly in the midst of queries and complaints over versions not being offered for male children. The Real Meal pans were larger than the Easy Bake ones, and it could bake both desserts and main courses. This model featured a heating element and did not require a light bulb.

In 2002, Hasbro released the Queasy Bake Cookerator, a variant on the Easy-Bake targeted at young boys.

In 2006, a different version of the Easy-Bake was released, with a stove-top warmer and a heating element. Like Hasbro&#x27;s first version, it had smaller pans, and it could only bake one pan at a time. But the new front-loading Hasbro design, a substantial departure from the traditional push-through arrangement, was ill-conceived, as all (approximately 985,000) such units were recalled over safety concerns and reported injuries.

The oven was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2006.

In 2011, the last version to use a 100-watt incandescent light bulb was replaced by a new version with a dedicated heating element, named the Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven. The replacement was due to the availability of alternatives to the incandescent light bulbs that heated previous versions of the Easy-Bake Oven. It was feared that newer lamp requirements would render all models that used light bulbs as their heating elements obsolete because lamps would no longer be available. (The company never provided initial or replacement bulbs.)

In 2012, Hasbro announced the premiere of a version of the Easy-Bake Oven in black and silver after executives met with McKenna Pope, a girl from Garfield, New Jersey, who had started a Change.org petition asking the toy maker to offer the product in gender-neutral packaging. The prototype Easy-Bake Oven was also made available in blue. The redesigned product was slated to be unveiled in February 2013, at the New York Toy Fair.

== Marketing ==
In 1962, Kenner created the Gooney Bird as part of its marketing efforts. The new corporate mascot was primarily used as part of the company logo, appearing on most product packaging along with the company slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s Kenner, It&#x27;s Fun!&quot;. The bird was also used in trade publications and advertisements with the tagline, &quot;This bird means business!&quot;.

In 1968, Kenner approached Muppet creator Jim Henson to create a Muppet version of the Gooney Bird. The bird appeared in Easy-Bake Oven commercials with child actress Barbara Price. The Gooney Bird became so popular that Henson refurbished the character as Little Bird, Big Bird&#x27;s smaller counterpart, in early seasons of &quot;Sesame Street.&quot;

==Recall ==
After a release of a new model in May 2006, Hasbro received reports of 29 children getting their hands or fingers caught in the front-loading door, including 5 reports of burns. In February 2007, Hasbro and the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a voluntary recall of the oven and advised parents to stop using the oven with children under the age of 8 and contact the company for a free retrofit kit. The kit was approved by the CPSC and consisted of a plastic grate that fit over the existing oven door. The grate allowed the oven to function as designed, but it now provided an additional barrier to keep small fingers out.

Despite the retrofit program, the problems persisted. According to data from the CPSC, an additional 249 reported incidents included 77 burns, 16 of which were second- or third-degree in nature. On July 19, 2007, Hasbro re-issued its voluntary recall of the Easy-Bake after learning that part of a five-year-old girl&#x27;s finger had to be amputated because of a severe burn. The recall affected 985,000 ovens that had been sold between May 2006 and July 2007. Ovens sold prior to May 2006 were not part of the recall, leaving more than 25 million side-entry/light bulb models in circulation unaffected.

== Legacy ==
National Easy-Bake Oven Day is observed annually on November 4, the day in which the toy oven was originally released in 1963. The National Day was established in 2017 by author and toy historian Todd Coopee.

<doc id="802377" wikidata="Q1369900" url="?curid=802377" title="Arabization">
<text>Arabization or Arabicization () is a sociological process of cultural change in which a non-Arab society becomes Arab, meaning it either directly adopts or becomes strongly influenced by the Arabic language, culture, literature, art, music, and ethnic identity as well as other socio-cultural factors. It is a specific form of cultural assimilation that often includes a language shift. The term applies not only to cultures, but also to individuals, as they acclimate to Arab culture and become &quot;Arabized&quot;. Arabization took place after the Muslim conquest of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as during the more recent Arab nationalist policies toward non-Arab minorities in modern Arab states, such as Algeria, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, and Sudan.

After the rise of Islam in the Hejaz and subsequent Muslims conquests, Arab culture and language spread outside the Arabian Peninsula through trade and intermarriages between members of the non-Arab local population and the peninsular Arabs. The Arabic language began to serve as a lingua franca in these areas and various dialects were formed. This process was accelerated by the migration of various Arab tribes outside of Arabia, such as the Arab migrations to the Maghreb and the Levant.

The influence of Arabic has been profound in many other countries whose cultures have been influenced by Islam. Arabic was a major source of vocabulary for various languages. This process reached its zenith between the 10th and 14th centuries, widely considered to be the high point of Arab culture, during the Islamic Golden Age.

==Early Arab expansion in the Near East==
After Alexander the Great, the Nabataean Kingdom emerged and ruled a region extending from north of Arabia to the south of Syria. The Nabataeans originated from the Arabian peninsula, who came under the influence of the earlier Aramaic culture, the neighbouring Hebrew culture of the Hasmonean kingdom, as well as the Hellenistic cultures in the region (especially with the Christianization of Nabateans in the 3rd and 4th centuries). The pre-modern Arabic language was created by Nabateans, who developed the Nabataean alphabet which became the basis of modern Arabic script. The Nabataean language, under heavy Arab influence, amalgamated into the Arabic language.

The Arab Ghassanids were the last major non-Islamic Semitic migration northward out of Yemen in late classic era. They were Greek Orthodox Christian, and clients of the Byzantine Empire. They arrived in Byzantine Syria which had a largely Aramean population. They initially settled in the Hauran region, eventually spreading to the entire Levant (modern Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Jordan), briefly securing governorship of parts of Syria and Transjordan away from the Nabataeans.

The Arab Lakhmid Kingdom was founded by the Lakhum tribe that emigrated from Yemen in the 2nd century and ruled by the Banu Lakhm, hence the name given it. They adopted the religion of the Church of the East, founded in Assyria/Asōristān, opposed to the Ghassanids Greek Orthodox Christianity, and were clients of the Sasanian Empire.

The Byzantines and Sasanians used the Ghassanids and Lakhmids to fight proxy wars in Arabia against each other.

==History of Arabization==
===Arabization during the early Caliphate===
The most significant wave of &quot;Arabization&quot; in history followed the early Muslim conquests of Muhammad and the subsequent Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates. These Arab empires were the first to grow well beyond the Arabian Peninsula, eventually reaching as far as Iberia in the West and Central Asia to the East, covering , one of the largest imperial expanses in history.

===Southern Arabia===
South Arabia is a historical region that consists of the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mainly centered in what is now the Republic of Yemen, yet it also included Najran, Jizan, and &#x27;Asir, which are presently in Saudi Arabia, and the Dhofar of present-day Oman.

Old South Arabian was driven to extinction by the Islamic expansion, being replaced by Classical Arabic which is written with the Arabic script. The South Arabian alphabet which was used to write it also fell out of use. A separate branch of South Semitic, the Modern South Arabian languages still survive today as spoken languages in southern of present-day Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Dhofar in present-day Oman.

Although Yemen is traditionally held to be the homeland of the Qahtanite Arabs who, according to Arab tradition, are pure Arabs; however, most of the sedentary Yemeni population did not speak Old Arabic prior to the spread of Islam, and spoke the extinct Old South Arabian languages instead.

===Eastern and Northern Arabia===

Before the 7th century CE, the population of Eastern Arabia consisted of Christian Arabs, Zoroastrian Arabs, Jews, and Aramaic-speaking agriculturalists. Some sedentary dialects of Eastern Arabia exhibit Akkadian, Aramaic and Syriac features. The sedentary people of ancient Bahrain were Aramaic speakers and to some degree Persian speakers, while Syriac functioned as a liturgical language.

Even within Northern Arabia, Arabization occurred to non-Arab populations such as the Hutaym in the northwestern Arabia and the Solluba in the Syrian Desert and the region of Mosul.

===The Levant===
Prior to the Islamic conquests, Arabs and Arabic inscriptions existed in the region; The roman emperor Philip the Arab was born in what is now Bosra, Syria. The Emasene dynasty were a Roman client dynasty of Syrian priest-kings known to have ruled by 46 BC from Arethusa and later from Emesa, Syria, until between 72 and 78/79 and they were of Arab origin. The Safaitic (named after Al-Safa region in Syria) inscriptions of old Arabic existed in Harrat al-Sham, the script existed in the period from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE.

On the eve of the Rashidun Caliphate conquest of the Levant, 634 AD, Syria&#x27;s population mainly spoke Aramaic; Greek was the official language of administration. Arabization and Islamization of Syria began in the 7th century, and it took several centuries for Islam, the Arab identity, and language to spread; the Arabs of the caliphate did not attempt to spread their language or religion in the early periods of the conquest, and formed an isolated aristocracy. The Arabs of the caliphate accommodated many new tribes in isolated areas to avoid conflict with the locals; caliph Uthman ordered his governor, Muawiyah I, to settle the new tribes away from the original population. Syrians who belonged to Monophysitic denominations welcomed the peninsular Arabs as liberators.

The Abbasids in the eighth and ninth century sought to integrate the peoples under their authority, and the Arabization of the administration was one of the tools. Arabization gained momentum with the increasing numbers of Muslim converts; the ascendancy of Arabic as the formal language of the state prompted the cultural and linguistic assimilation of Syrian converts. Those who remained Christian also became Arabized; it was probably during the Abbasid period in the ninth century that Christians adopted Arabic as their first language; the first translation of the gospels into Arabic took place in this century. Many historians, such as Claude Cahen and Bernard Hamilton, proposed that the Arabization of Christians was completed before the First Crusade. By the thirteenth century, Arabic language achieved dominance in the region and its speakers became Arabs.

===Egypt===
Prior to the Islamic conquests, Arabs had been inhabiting the Sinai Peninsula, the Eastern desert and eastern Delta for centuries. These regions of Egypt collectively were known as &quot;Arabia&quot; to the contemporary historians and writers documenting them. Several pre-Islamic Arab kingdoms, such as the Qedarite Kingdom, extended into these regions. Inscriptions and other archeological remains, such as bowls bearing inscriptions identifying Qedarite kings and Nabatean Arabic inscriptions, affirm the Arab presence in the region. Egypt was conquered from the Romans by the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century CE. The Coptic language, which was written using the Coptic variation of the Greek alphabet, was spoken in most of Egypt prior to the Islamic conquest. Arabic, however, was already being spoken in the eastern fringes of Egypt for centuries prior to the arrival of Islam. By the Mameluke era, the Arabization of the Egyptian populace alongside a shift in the majority religion going from Christianity to Islam, had taken place.

===The Maghreb===
Neither North Africa nor the Iberian Peninsula were strangers to Semitic culture: the Phoenicians and later the Carthaginians dominated parts of the North African and Iberian shores for more than eight centuries until they were suppressed by the Romans and by the following Vandal and Visigothic invasions, and the Berber incursions.

From the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th century, Arabs began to migrate to the Maghreb in several waves. Arab migrants settled in all parts of the Maghreb, coming as peaceful newcomers who were welcomed everywhere, establishing large Arab settlements in many areas. In addition to changing the population&#x27;s demographics, the early migration of Arab tribes resulted in the Arabization of the native Berber population. This initial wave contributed to the Berber adoption of Arab culture. Furthermore, the Arabic language spread during this period and drove local Latin (African Romance) into extinction in the cities. The Arabization took place around Arab centres through the influence of Arabs in the cities and rural areas surrounding them.

Arab political entities in the Maghreb such as the Aghlabids, Idrisids, Salihids and Fatimids, were influential in encouraging Arabization by attracting Arab migrants and by promoting Arab culture. In addition, disturbances and political unrest in the Mashriq compelled the Arabs to migrate to the Maghreb in search of security and stability.

After establishing Cairo in 969, the Fatimids left rule over Tunisia and eastern Algeria to the local Zirid dynasty (972–1148). In response to the Zirids later declaring independence from the Fatimids, the Fatimids dispatched large Bedouin Arab tribes, mainly the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, to defeat the Zirids and settle in the Maghreb. The invasion of Ifriqiya by the Banu Hilal, a warlike Arab Bedouin tribe, sent the region&#x27;s urban and economic life into further decline. The Arab historian Ibn Khaldun wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert. The Fatimid caliph instructed the Bedouin tribes to rule the Maghreb instead of the Zirid emir Al-Mu&#x27;izz and told them &quot;I have given you the Maghrib and the rule of al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Balkīn as-Sanhājī the runaway slave. You will want for nothing.&quot; and told Al-Mu&#x27;izz &quot;I have sent you horses and put brave men on them so that God might accomplish a matter already enacted&quot;. Sources estimated that the total number of Arab nomads who migrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century was at around 1 million Arabs. There were later Arab migrations to the Maghreb by Maqil and Beni Hassan in the 13th-15th century and by Andalusi refugees in the 15th-17th century.

The migration of Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym in the 11th century had a much greater influence on the process of Arabization of the population than did the earlier migrations. It played a major role in spreading Bedouin Arabic to rural areas such as the countryside and steppes, and as far as the southern areas near the Sahara. It also heavily transformed the culture of the Maghreb into Arab culture, and spread nomadism in areas where agriculture was previously dominant.

===Al-Andalus===
After the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, under the Arab Muslim rule Iberia (&quot;al-Andalus&quot;) incorporated elements of Arabic language and culture. The Mozarabs were Iberian Christians who lived under Arab Islamic rule in Al-Andalus. Their descendants remained unconverted to Islam, but did however adopt elements of Arabic language and culture and dress. They were mostly Roman Catholics of the Visigothic or Mozarabic Rite. Most of the Mozarabs were descendants of Hispano–Gothic Christians and were primarily speakers of the Mozarabic language under Islamic rule. Many were also what the Arabist Mikel de Epalza calls &quot;Neo-Mozarabs&quot;, that is Northern Europeans who had come to the Iberian Peninsula and picked up Arabic, thereby entering the Mozarabic community.

Besides Mozarabs, another group of people in Iberia eventually came to surpass the Mozarabs both in terms of population and Arabization. These were the Muladi or Muwalladun, most of whom were descendants of local Hispano-Basques and Visigoths who converted to Islam and adopted Arabic culture, dress, and language. By the 11th century, most of the population of al-Andalus was Muladi, with large minorities of other Muslims, Mozarabs, and Sephardic Jews. It was the Muladi, together with the Berber, Arab, and other (Saqaliba and Zanj) Muslims who became collectively termed in Christian Europe as &quot;Moors&quot;.

The Andalusian Arabic was spoken in Iberia during Islamic rule.

===Sicily, Malta, and Crete===
A similar process of Arabization and Islamization occurred in the Emirate of Sicily (&quot;Ṣiqilliyyah&quot;) and Malta (&quot;Mālṭā&quot;), and the Emirate of Crete (&quot;Iqrīṭish&quot; or &quot;Iqrīṭiya&quot;), during this period some segments of the populations of these islands converted to Islam and began to adopt elements of Arabic culture, traditions, and customs. The Arabization process also resulted in the development of the now extinct Siculo-Arabic language, from which the modern Maltese language derives. By contrast, the present-day Sicilian language, which is an Italo-Dalmatian Romance language, retains very little Siculo-Arabic, with its influence being limited to some 300 words.

===Sudan===
Contacts between Nubians and Arabs long predated the coming of Islam, but the Arabization of the Nile Valley was a gradual process that occurred over a period of nearly one thousand years. Arab nomads continually wandered into the region in search of fresh pasturage, and Arab seafarers and merchants traded at Red Sea ports for spices and slaves. Intermarriage and assimilation also facilitated Arabization. Traditional genealogies trace the ancestry of the Nile valley&#x27;s area of Sudan mixed population to Arab tribes that migrated into the region during this period. Even many non-Arabic-speaking groups claim descent from Arab forebears. The two most important Arabic-speaking groups to emerge in Nubia were the Ja&#x27;alin and the Juhaynah. 
In the 12th century, the Arab Ja&#x27;alin tribe migrated into Nubia and Sudan and gradually occupied the regions on both banks of the Nile from Khartoum to Abu Hamad. They trace their lineage to Abbas, uncle of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They are of Arab origin, but now of mixed blood mostly with Northern Sudanese and Nubians. In the 16th and 17th centuries, new Islamic kingdoms were established – the Funj Sultanate and the Sultanate of Darfur, starting a long period of gradual Islamization and Arabization in Sudan. These sultanates and their societies existed until the Sudan was conquered by the Ottoman Egyptian invasion in 1820, and in the case of Darfur, even until 1916.

In 1846, Arab Rashaida, who speak Hejazi Arabic, migrated from the Hejaz in present-day Saudi Arabia into what is now Eritrea and north-east Sudan, after tribal warfare had broken out in their homeland. The Rashaida of Sudan live in close proximity with the Beja people, who speak Bedawiye dialects in eastern Sudan.

===The Sahel===

In medieval times, the Baggara Arabs, a grouping of Arab ethnic groups who speak Shuwa Arabic (which is one of the regional varieties of Arabic in Africa), migrated into Africa, mainly between Lake Chad and southern Kordofan.

Currently, they live in a belt which stretches across Sudan, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic and South Sudan and they number over six million people. Like other Arabic speaking tribes in the Sahara and the Sahel, Baggara tribes have origin ancestry from the Juhaynah Arab tribes who migrated directly from the Arabian peninsula or from other parts of north Africa. 

Arabic is an official language of Chad and Sudan as well as a national language in Niger, Mali, Senegal, and South Sudan. In addition, Arabic dialects are spoken of minorities in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Central African Republic.

==Arabization in modern times==

In the modern era, Arabization occurred due to the Arab nationalist policies toward non-Arab minorities in modern Arab states, including Algeria, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Sudan. Modern Arabization also occurred to reverse the consequences of European colonialism. Arab governments often imposed policies that sought to promote the use of Modern Standard Arabic and eliminate the languages of former colonizers, such as the reversing of street signs from French to Arabic names in Algeria.

===Arabization in Algeria===
The unification and pursuit of a single Algerian identity was to be found in the Arab identity, Arabic language and religion. Ben Bella composed the Algerian constitution in October 1963, which asserted that Islam was the state religion, Arabic was the sole national and official language of the state, Algeria was an integral part of the Arab world, and that Arabization was the first priority of the country to reverse French colonization. According to Abdelhamid Mehri, the decision of Arabic as an official language was the natural choice for Algerians, even though Algeria is a plurilingual nation with a minority, albeit substantial, number of Berbers within the nation, and the local variety of Arabic used in every-day life, Algerian Arabic, was distinct from the official language, Modern Standard Arabic.

Modern Arabization in Algeria took place to develop and promote Arabic into the nation&#x27;s education system, government, and media in order to replace the former language that was enforced due to colonization, French. Algeria had been conquered by France and even made to be part of its metropolitan core for 132 years, a significantly longer timespan compared to Morocco and Tunisia, and it was also more influenced by Europe due to the contiguity with French settlers in Algeria: both Algerian and French nationals used to live in the same towns, resulting in the cohabitation of the two populations.

While trying to build an independent and unified nation-state after the Evian Accords, the Algerian government under Ahmed Ben Bella&#x27;s rule began a policy of Arabization. Indeed, due to the lasting and deep colonization, French was the major administrative and academic language in Algeria, even more so than in neighboring countries. Since independence, Algerian nationalism was heavily influenced by Arab socialism, Islamism and Arab nationalism.

However, the process of Arabization was meant not only to promote Islam, but to fix the gap and decrease any conflicts between the different Algerian ethnic groups and promote equality through monolingualism. In 1964 the first practical measure was the Arabization of primary education and the introduction of religious education, the state relying on Egyptian teachers – belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and therefore particularly religious – due to its lack of literary Arabic-speakers. In 1968, during the Houari Boumediene regime, Arabization was extended, and a law tried to enforce the use of Arabic for civil servants, but again, the major role played by French was only diminished.

The whole policy was ultimately not as effective as anticipated: French has kept its importance and Berber opposition kept growing, contributing to the 1988 October Riots. Some Berber groups, like the Kabyles, felt that their ancestral culture and language were threatened and the Arab identity was given more focus at the expense of their own. After the Algerian Civil War, the government tried to enforce even more the use of Arabic, but the relative effect of this policy after 1998 (the limit fixed for complete Arabization) forced the heads of state to make concessions towards Berber, recognizing it in 2002 as another national language that will be promoted. However, because of literary Arabic&#x27;s symbolic advantage, as well as being a single language as opposed to the fragmented Berber languages, Arabization is still a goal for the state, for example with laws on civil and administrative procedures.

===Arabization in Oman===
Despite being a nation of the Arabian Peninsula, Oman had been home to several native languages other than Arabic, of which Kumzari which is the only native Indo-European language in the Arabian Peninsula has been classified as highly endangered by the UNESCO and at risk of dying out in 50 years. Before the takeover of Qaboos as sultan, Arabic was only ever spoken by the inhabitants outside the village of Kumzar, in mosques or with strangers, however since the introduction of Arabic-only schools in 1984, Arabic is hence now spoken at both school and village with it being mandatory in school and as TV and radio are also in Arabic meaning virtually all media the people of Kumzar are exposed to is in Arabic. There has also been an internalization of outsiders&#x27; negative attitudes toward the Kumzari language to the point where some Kumzari families have begun to speak Arabic to their children at home.

The Modern South Arabian languages have also come under threat in Oman. Hobyot is considered a critically endangered language. The actual number of speakers is unknown, but it is estimated to be only a few hundred. Most of those who maintain the language are elderly, which adds to the likelihood that language extinction is near. Ethnologue categorizes it as a moribund language (EGIDS 8a). The only fluent speakers that are left are older than the child-bearing age, which ultimately makes integration of the language into subsequent generations highly improbable. Mechanisms of transmission would have to be created from outside the community in order to preserve it.

The Harsusi language is also critically endangered, as most Harsusi children now attend Arabic-language schools and are literate in Arabic, Harsusi is spoken less in the home, meaning that it is not being passed down to future generations. With the discovery of oil in the area and the reintroduction of the Arabian Oryx in the area which has provided job opportunities for Harsusi men, this has led to them using primarily Arabic or Mehri when communicating with their co-workers. These factors have also caused many Harasis to speak Arabic and Mehri in addition to or in place of Harsusi. These pressures led one researcher to conclude in 1981 that &quot;within a few generations Harsusi will be replaced by Arabic, more specifically by the Omani Arabic standard dialect&quot; though this has not yet materialized. UNESCO has categorised Harsusi as a language that is &quot;definitely endangered&quot;.

The Shehri language has also come under threat in recent years, prior to the Arabization of Oman, Shehri was once spoken from Yemen&#x27;s Hadhramaut region to Ras Al Hadd in Eastern Oman. Until around as little as forty years ago, Shehri was spoken by all of the inhabitants of Dhofar as the common language, including by the native Arabic speakers in Salalah who spoke it fluently. The remainder of Dhofar&#x27;s inhabitants all spoke Shehri as their mother tongue. Today however Arabic has taken over as the form of mutual communication in Dhofar and is now exclusively spoken by those to whom it is their native tongue. A number of the older generation of Shehri language speakers, particularly those who live in the mountains, don&#x27;t even speak Arabic and it was only around fifty years ago that most of Dhofar&#x27;s Shehri speaking population began to learn it. The fact that Arabic has a written form unlike Shehri has also greatly contributed to its decline.

Another language, Bathari is the most at risk of dying out with its numbers (as of 2019) at currently anywhere from 12 to 17 fluent elderly speakers whereas there are some middle aged speakers but they mix their ancestral tongue with Arabic instead. The tribe seems to be dying out with the language also under threat from modern education solely in Arabic. The Bathari language is nearly extinct. Estimates are that the number of remaining speakers are under 100.

===Arabization in Morocco===
Following 44 years of colonization by France, Morocco began promoting the use of Modern Standard Arabic to create a united Moroccan national identity, and increase literacy throughout the nation away from any predominant language within the administration and educational system. Unlike Algeria, Morocco did not encounter with the French as strongly because the Moroccan population was scattered throughout the nation and major cities, which resulted in a decrease of French influence compared to the neighboring nations.

First and foremost, educational policy was the main focus within the process, debates surfaced between officials who preferred a &quot;modern and westernized&quot; education with enforcement of bilingualism while others fought for a traditional route with a focus of &quot;Arabo-Islamic culture&quot;. Once the Istiqlal Party took power, the party focused on placing a language policy siding with the traditional ideas of supporting and focusing on Arabic and Islam. The Istiqlal Party implemented the policy rapidly and by the second year after gaining independence, the first year of primary education was completely Arabized, and a bilingual policy was placed for the remaining primary education decreasing the hours of French being taught in a staggered manner.

Arabization in schools had been more time-consuming and difficult than expected because for the first 20 years following independence, politicians (most of which were educated in France or French private school in Morocco) were indecisive as to if Arabization was best for the country and its political and economic ties with European nations. Regardless, complete Arabization can only be achieved if Morocco becomes completely independent from France in all aspects; politically, economically, and socially. Around 1960, Hajj Omar Abdeljalil the education minister at the time reversed all the effort made to Arabize the public school and reverted to pre-independent policies, favoring French and westernized learning. Another factor that reflected the support of reversing the Arabization process in Morocco, was the effort made by King Hassan II, who supported the Arabization process but on the contrary increased political and economic dependence on France. Because Morocco remained dependent on France and wanted to keep strong ties with the Western world, French was supported by the elites more than Arabic for the development of Morocco.

===Arabization in Tunisia===
The Arabization process in Tunisia theoretically should have been the easiest within the North African region because less than 1% of its population was Berber, and practically 100% of the population natively spoke vernacular Tunisian Arabic. However, it was the least successful due to its dependence on European nations and belief in Westernizing the nation for the future development of the people and the country. Much like Morocco, Tunisian leaders&#x27; debate consisted of traditionalists and modernists, traditionalists claiming that Arabic (specifically Classical Arabic) and Islam are the core of Tunisia and its national identity, while modernists believed that Westernized development distant from &quot;Pan-Arabist ideas&quot; are crucial for Tunisia&#x27;s progress. Modernists had the upper hand, considering elites supported their ideals, and after the first wave of graduates that had passed their high school examinations in Arabic were not able to find jobs nor attend a university because they did not qualify due to French preference in any upper-level university or career other than Arabic and Religious Studies Department.

There were legitimate efforts made to Arabize the nation from the 1970s up until 1982, though the efforts came to an end and the process of reversing all the progress of Arabization began and French implementation in schooling took effect. The Arabization process was criticized and linked with Islamic extremists, resulting in the process of &quot;Francophonie&quot; or promoting French ideals, values, and language throughout the nation and placing its importance above Arabic. Although Tunisia gained its independence, nevertheless the elites supported French values above Arabic, the answer to developing an educated and modern nation, all came from Westernization. The constitution stated that Arabic was the official language of Tunisia but nowhere did it claim that Arabic must be utilized within the administrations or every-day life, which resulted in an increase of French usage not only in science and technology courses. Further, major media channels were in French, and government administrations were divided—some were in Arabic while others were in French.

===Arabization in Sudan===
Sudan is an ethnically mixed country that is economically and politically dominated by the society of central northern Sudan, where many identify as Arabs and Muslims. The population in South Sudan consists mostly of Christian and Animist Nilotic people, who have been regarded for centuries as non-Arab, African people. Apart from Modern Standard Arabic, taught in schools and higher education, and the spoken forms of Sudanese Arabic colloquial, several other languages are spoken by diverse ethnic groups.

Since independence in 1956, Sudan has been a multilingual country, with Sudanese Arabic as the major first or second language. In the 2005 constitution of the Republic of Sudan and following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the official languages of Sudan were declared Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and English. Before the independence of South Sudan in 2011, people in the southern parts of the country, who mainly speak Nilo-Saharan languages or Juba Arabic, were subjected to the official policy of Arabization by the central government. The constitution declared, however, that &quot;all indigenous languages of the Sudan are national languages and shall be respected, developed, and promoted,&quot; and it allowed any legislative body below the national level to adopt any other national language(s) as additional official working language(s) within that body&#x27;s jurisdiction.

MSA is also the language used in Sudan&#x27;s central government, the press, as well as in official programmes of Sudan television and Radio Omdurman. Several lingua francas have emerged, and many people have become genuinely multilingual, fluent in a native language spoken at home, a lingua franca, and perhaps other languages.

===Arabization in Mauritania===
Mauritania is an ethnically-mixed country that is economically and politically dominated by those who identify as Arabs and/or Arabic-speaking Berbers. About 30% of the population is considered &quot;Black African&quot;, and the other 40% are Arabized Blacks, both groups suffering high levels of discrimination. Recent Black Mauritanian protesters have complained of &quot;comprehensive Arabization&quot; of the country.

===Arabization in Iraq===
Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;ath Party had aggressive Arabization policies involving driving out many pre-Arab and non-Arab ethnic groups – mainly Kurds, Assyrians, Yezidis, Shabaks, Armenians, Turcomans, Kawliya, Circassians, and Mandeans – replacing them with Arab families.

In the 1970s, Saddam Hussein exiled between 350,000 and 650,000 Shia Iraqis of Iranian ancestry (Ajam). Most of them went to Iran. Those who could prove an Iranian/Persian ancestry in Iran&#x27;s court received Iranian citizenship (400,000) and some of them returned to Iraq after Saddam.

During the Iran-Iraq War, the Anfal campaign destroyed many Kurdish, Assyrian and other ethnic minority villages and enclaves in North Iraq, and their inhabitants were often forcibly relocated to large cities in the hope that they would be Arabized.

This policy drove out 500,000 people in the years 1991–2003. The Baathists also pressured many of these ethnic groups to identify as Arabs, and restrictions were imposed upon their languages, cultural expression and right to self-identification.

===Arabization in Syria===
Since the independence of Syria in 1946, the ethnically diverse Rojava region in northern Syria suffered grave human rights violations, because all governments pursued a most brutal policy of Arabization. While all non-Arab ethnic groups within Syria, such as Assyrians, Armenians, Turcomans, and Mhallami have faced pressure from Arab Nationalist policies to identify as &quot;Arabs&quot;, the most archaic of it was directed against the Kurds. In his report for the 12th session of the UN Human Rights Council titled &quot;Persecution and Discrimination against Kurdish Citizens in Syria&quot;, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights held: &quot;Successive Syrian governments continued to adopt a policy of ethnic discrimination and national persecution against Kurds, completely depriving them of their national, democratic and human rights — an integral part of human existence. The government imposed ethnically-based programs, regulations and exclusionary measures on various aspects of Kurds&#x27; lives — political, economic, social and cultural.&quot;

The Kurdish language was not officially recognized, it had no place in public schools. A decree from 1989 prohibited the use of Kurdish at the workplace as well as in marriages and other celebrations. In September 1992 came another government decree that children not be registered with Kurdish names. Also businesses could not be given Kurdish names. Books, music, videos and other material could not be published in Kurdish language. Expressions of Kurdish identity like songs and folk dances were outlawed and frequently prosecuted under a purpose-built criminal law against &quot;weakening national sentiment&quot;. Celebrating the Nowruz holiday was often constrained.

In 1973, the Syrian authorities confiscated 750 square kilometers of fertile agricultural land in Al-Hasakah Governorate, which were owned and cultivated by tens of thousands of Kurdish citizens, and gave it to Arab families brought in from other provinces. Describing the settlement policies pursued by the regime as part of the &quot;Arab Belt programme, a Kurdish engineer in the region stated: &quot;The government built them homes for free, gave them weapons, seeds and fertilizer, and created agricultural banks that provided loans. From 1973 to 1975, forty-one villages were created in this strip, beginning ten kilometers west of Ras al-&#x27;Ayn. The idea was to separate Turkish and Syrian Kurds, and to force Kurds in the area to move away to the cities. Any Arab could settle in Hasakeh, but no Kurd was permitted to move and settle there.&quot;

In 2007, in another such scheme in Al-Hasakah governate, 6,000 square kilometers around Al-Malikiyah were granted to Arab families, while tens of thousands of Kurdish inhabitants of the villages concerned were evicted. These and other expropriations of ethnic Kurdish citizens followed a deliberate masterplan, called &quot;Arab Belt initiative&quot;, attempting to depopulate the resource-rich Jazeera of its ethnic Kurdish inhabitants and settle ethnic Arabs there.

After the Turkish-led forces had captured Afrin District in early 2018, they began to implement a resettlement policy by moving Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army fighters and Sunni Arab refugees from southern Syria into the empty homes that belonged to displaced locals. The previous owners, most of them Kurds or Yazidis, were often prevented from returning to Afrin. Refugees from Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, said that they were part of &quot;an organised demographic change&quot; which was supposed to replace the Kurdish population of Afrin with an Arab majority.

==De-Arabization==
In the modern era, de-Arabization can refer to government policies which aim to reverse Arabization, such as the reversal of the Arabization of Kurds in northern Iraq and Mizrahi Jews in Israel.

===Historic reversions of Arabization===
====Norman conquest of southern Italy (999-1139)====
The Muslim conquest of Sicily lasted from 827 until 902 when the Emirate of Sicily was established. It was marked by an Arab–Byzantine culture. Sicily in turn was then subjected to the Norman conquest of southern Italy from 999 to 1139. The Arab identity of Sicily came to an end latest by the mid-13th century.

====Reconquista (1212-1492)====
The &quot;Reconquista&quot; in the Iberian Peninsula is the most notable example of a historic reversion of Arabization. The process of Arabization and Islamization was reversed as the mostly Christian kingdoms in the north of the peninsula conquered Toledo in 1212 and Cordoba in 1236. Granada, the last remaining emirate on the peninsula, was conquered in January 1492. The re-conquered territories were Hispanicized and Christianized, although the culture, languages and religious traditions imposed differed from those of the previous Visigothic kingdom.

===Reversions in modern times===
In modern times, there have been various political developments to reverse the process of Arabization. Notable among these are:
* The 1948 establishment of the State of Israel as a Jewish polity, Hebraization of Palestinian place names, use of Hebrew as an official language (with Arabic remaining co-official) and the de-Arabization of the Arabic-speaking Sephardim and Mizrahi Jews who arrived in Israel from the Arab world.
* The 1992 establishment of a Kurdish-dominated polity in Mesopotamia as Iraqi Kurdistan.
* The 2012 establishment of a multi-ethnic Democratic Federation of Northern Syria.
* Berberism, a Berber political-cultural movement of ethnic, geographic, or cultural nationalism present in Algeria, Morocco and broader North Africa including Mali. The Berberist movement is in opposition to cultural Arabization and the pan-Arabist political ideology, and is also associated with secularism.
* South Sudan&#x27;s secession from Arab-led Sudan in 2011 after a bloody civil war decreased Sudan&#x27;s territory by almost half. Sudan is a member of the Arab League while South Sudan did not enter membership. Arabic also is not an official language of South Sudan. 
*Arabization of Malays was criticized by Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of Johor. He urged the retention of Malay culture instead of introducing Arab culture. He called on people to not mind unveiled women or mixed sex handshaking, and urged against using Arabic words in place of Malay words. He suggested Saudi Arabia as a destination for those who wanted Arab culture. He said that he was going to adhere to Malay culture himself. Abdul Aziz Bari said that Islam and Arab culture are intertwined and criticized the Johor Sultan for what he said. Datuk Haris Kasim, who leads the Selangor Islamic Religious Department, also criticized the Sultan for his remarks.
* The Chinese government launched a campaign in 2018 to remove Arab-style domes and minarets from mosques in a campaign called &quot;de-Arabization&quot; and &quot;de-Saudization&quot;.

<doc id="802393" wikidata="Q365321" url="?curid=802393" title="The 411">
<text>The 411 are an English girl group comprising Carolyn Owlett, Tisha Martin and Tanya Bryson. The group was formed in late 2002 after Martin and Bryson sang backing vocals on Lemar&#x27;s version of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;. The 411 took its name from the Mary J. Blige album &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; (1992). The group released one studio album, &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;, and three top-forty singles before disbanding for the first time in 2005.

The 411 was reformed in 2007 with a new name, Sunshyne, with two new members after Furlonger left a few months before. The band soon changed back to its original name and Furlonger was replaced by Nuala Farrelly, who was a member of Sunshyne. Martin announced in 2008 on her own personal &quot;Myspace&quot; account that the band had yet again split up but still remained friends and that it would possibly release new material in the near future.

On 6 December 2021, it was announced that the 411 would reunite, originally for a one-off gig at Mighty Hoopla in June 2022 until the group added more gigs for the summer. Furlonger left the group for a second time in July 2022, owing to her busy schedule as a backing vocalist.

== History ==
=== 2002–2005: Formation and &quot;Between the Sheets&quot; ===
In 2002, Tanya Bryson and Tisha Martin — a familiar face at the time after appearing in the children&#x27;s television shows &quot;Kerching!&quot; and &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; — recorded backing vocals for the R&amp;B singer Lemar on his cover version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; by Al Green. A woman from Sony Music was in attendance and told them, &quot;You guys sound really nice together. If there were a few more of you we&#x27;d be interested in doing something with you.&quot; Carolyn Owlett grew up on the same street as Bryson, while Suzie Furlonger completed the line-up after a chance meeting when she visited London for the Notting Hill Carnival; after which the group went to do an audition for Sony, which resulted in a one-single record deal. The name &quot;The 411&quot; came from 4-1-1, an information line in the United States. Owlett told &quot;Newsround&quot;, &quot;We thought it&#x27;d be cool if people wanted the information on us! And also it&#x27;s the name of Mary J. Blige&#x27;s first album and we&#x27;re big fans!&quot;

Labelled by one critic as &quot;the hip hop Supremes&quot;, the group&#x27;s first single, &quot;On My Knees&quot;, was a hit in the UK (reaching the top 5) and Australia (reaching the top 30), which resulted in an album deal. A second single, &quot;Dumb&quot;, reached number 3 in the UK and the top 30 in Australia. These singles appeared on the group&#x27;s album &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;, with songs written by Diane Warren, Redeye and The 411 themselves. The group also recorded a cover version of SWV&#x27;s hit &quot;Weak&quot;.

&quot;Between the Sheets&quot; was also released in France and Japan. The French edition had two new versions of album tracks, recorded specifically for the French market: &quot;Face À Toi Baby&quot; featuring Mag (using the verses from &quot;Dumb&quot; with a special French chorus) and &quot;Chance&quot; featuring K&#x27;Maro (a new mix of &quot;Chance&quot; with a French language rap). The Japanese edition of the album had the standard 12 tracks from the UK version with two bonus tracks: &quot;Drop Top Jeans&quot; (which appeared as the B-side to &quot;Teardrops&quot; in the UK) and &quot;Soaking Wet&quot;, with an enhanced section featuring the videos for &quot;On My Knees&quot; and &quot;Dumb&quot;.

The album was certified Silver on 10 December 2004.

=== 2005–2007: Split and solo careers ===
In 2005, after the third single, &quot;Teardrops&quot;, missed the UK top 20 and &quot;Between the Sheets&quot; failed to make the top 40, the 411 were dropped by Sony and subsequently disbanded. In a 2009 interview, Furlonger told &quot;Digital Spy&quot;, &quot;When the album missed out on the top 40, I think our label just decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping us anymore.&quot; She went on to say, &quot;[Sony] were in the middle of a merger at the time so they were clearing out a lot of their less successful groups and singers. I think if we&#x27;d gone to them and literally begged, they might have given us another chance. We could have tried to bring it all back with a fourth single, but I don&#x27;t think there was anything on the album strong enough to be honest. I think another problem was that we didn&#x27;t have much publicity. When you look at Girls Aloud or The Saturdays, they&#x27;re always in the paper. We never had that kind of exposure.&quot;

After the split, Owlett and Furlonger were offered a new deal by Polydor to create a new girl group with one other unnamed former-girl group member. Owlett told the &quot;Right Back At Ya!&quot; podcast: &quot;The deal that was offered wasn&#x27;t for all of The 411. It was a whole new project, it was a development deal. They wanted to put in another girl and make it a hybrid thing. There was a girl from another band who had been doing OK but not busted in the way that they should&#x27;ve done but they had a lot of faith in this girl. I can tell you that it didn’t happen because I was one of them. We never found the sound. It was like they wanted to replicate The 411 but not as The 411 and it just didn&#x27;t work. We wrote some songs and nothing was right. The members that were in that band didn&#x27;t gel in the way that The 411 did. It was just a sad, sad time.&quot;

Furlonger worked as backing vocalist for various artists including Paloma Faith, Kevin Rowland, Percy Sledge, Sheila Ferguson, Emily Sandé, Peabo Bryson (duetting with him on several occasions) and regularly with Candi Staton and Cliff Richard (who also used her as his duet partner on tour). She also performed on shows such as &quot;&quot;, GMTV, &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot;, &quot;T4 on the Beach&quot;, the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; and at Glastonbury 2008 and 2010 with Candi Staton. Furlonger also appeared on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2008 as a solo singer in the Over-25s category, with Dannii Minogue as her mentor. She reached the final 6 but was eliminated from the show on 5 October, having failed to reach the live finals. Since the show, she has signed to Mousse T.&#x27;s label, Peppermint Jam, and recorded an album in Germany. She continues to provide backing vocals while in the UK and regularly toured with David Gest, duetting with some of the artists, as well as providing backing vocals for the other artists on &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

Bryson appeared in the identity parade in the first episode of the 23rd series of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, broadcast on 1 October 2009. She was not correctly identified, Ben Miller ruling her out as a possibility as he thought she was &quot;too young&quot; to have been in a defunct girl band.

=== 2007–2008: Reformation as Sunshyne ===
In September 2007, Bryson and Martin announced that they were forming a new group called &quot;Sunshyne&quot; and would be joined by Daizy Agnew and Nuala Farrelly. Agnew soon left and was replaced by Stephanie Barnes.

&quot;Sunshyne&quot; subsequently split up and Bryson and Martin decided to reform The 411, with the new line-up also including Owlett, who had not been involved in the formation of Sunshyne. The original member Furlonger was not involved, having decided to pursue other avenues, and her place was filled by Farrelly. However, in 2008, The 411 split up once again.

The band was reformed in 2007 and started recording songs for a second album with the new line-up.

&quot;LoveFool&quot; was to have been the fourth single by The 411 with two new members but it was later cancelled along with the album.

=== 2021–present: reunion and Furlonger&#x27;s departure ===
On 6 December 2021, it was announced that the 411 would reform and perform at Mighty Hoopla on 4 June 2022 with the Sugababes. All four original members were confirmed to be rejoining the band for the performance. Owlett later told &quot;Entertainment Focus&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ve been asked for a really long time to get back together, every year for probably the last 15 years. It&#x27;s funny because my brother is really good friends with Jamie who runs Mighty Hoopla and he kept saying that if you guys get back together we’ll book you. When we were asked about this year we all said let&#x27;s just do it. It just felt like the right time. We&#x27;d all had kids… but they are of an age where now we thought maybe we can pull this together. We said &#x27;yes&#x27; to it and I don&#x27;t think we knew how it would pan out.&quot;

Because of her busy schedule as a backing vocalist, Furlonger&#x27;s departure was announced on 13 July, leaving the group to carry on as a trio.

Although the Mighty Hoopla gig was originally supposed to be a one-off performance, the 411 announced they would perform at the 90s Baby Pop Tour in September and October 2022 with Atomic Kitten, Five and Liberty X. On 7 September, the group confirmed it would be performing at the Mighty Hoopla Weekender in January 2023. The group performed at a Butlins Weekender in January 2024.

<text>The Arathi, a term meaning &quot;prophets&quot;, are a Christian religious movement founded in 1926 in Kenya. Along with the African Orthodox Church, Arathi was founded by the Agikuyu in the wake of Kenya&#x27;s civil unrest during the 1920. Joseph Ng&#x27;ang&#x27;a and Musa Thuo are among the sect&#x27;s most notable prophets.

Arathi was outlawed in 1934, when colonial officials prohibited Arathi meetings.

Baptism has remained a central part of the Arathi tradition since its founding, and is still practiced today. It is viewed as a symbol of the beginning of a new life, and followers receive a new name after their baptism.

<doc id="802415" wikidata="Q2042303" url="?curid=802415" title="Income tax in the Netherlands">
<text>Income tax in the Netherlands (personal, rather than corporate) is regulated by the &quot;Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001&quot; (Income Tax Law, 2001).

The fiscal year is the same as the calendar year. Before May 1 citizens have to report their income from the previous year. The system integrates the income tax with fees paid for the general old age pension system (AOW), the pension system for partners of deceased people (ANW), and the national insurance system for special medical care (WLZ).

There are three categories of income, each with their own tax rates. They are referred to as &quot;boxes&quot;.

==Progressive tax on wages etc. (box 1)==
There is a progressive tax on wages, social security benefits and pensions. Thus there are tax brackets, each with its own tax rate. Mathematically, apart from discretization (whole euros both for income and for tax), the tax is a continuous, convex, piecewise linear function of income.

For people above the pension age, the social security component is reduced. Additionally, there are income-dependent deductions and tax credits for incomes up to €90,710 which decrease the effective tax rate.

Under certain conditions a life annuity is treated as a pension: premiums are deducted from the income, the benefits are taxed, and the scheme is not counted as asset in box 3. The conditions concern the type of life annuity and the necessity, based on the principle that the higher the income is, the more pension plus life annuity one needs to build up for the future, up to a maximum.

For the value of an owner-occupied dwelling and for mortgage debt related to that, this box and not box 3 applies. Based on the value of the dwelling, a &quot;fixed rentable value&quot; is counted, while interest for the mortgage is deductible. This is an important factor, since interest on a mortgage can easily be over a thousands euros per month, which is subtracted from income before any income tax is applied. If the value of an owner-occupied dwelling would be positive (fixed rentable value is greater than interest) it is changed to zero.

For taxpayers above the official retirement age reduced rates apply for the first two brackets. In 2019, the corresponding tax rates are 18.75% and 20.20%. The discount of 17.9% of the income in these brackets corresponds to the AOW contributions, which are not owed by the AOW beneficiaries. In 2018, the retirement age in the Netherlands was postponed from 65 years and 9 months to 66 years.

For employed and self-employed people there is an employment rebate.

The wage withholding tax is a deduction of wages, social security benefits and pensions, as an advance payment for the income tax, paid through the employer, etc.

See also box 1 .

===Health insurance premium===
From 2006 there is a new national health insurance scheme (&quot;zorgverzekering(swet)&quot;, &quot;Zvw&quot;). The premium is partly income-dependent and paid as a tax supplement. It applies for the &quot;contribution income&quot; (&quot;bijdrage-inkomen&quot;), which is part of box 1, including labor income, social security benefits, pensions, and life annuities (it does not include the &quot;owner-occupied dwelling income&quot;). It is withheld if the wage withholding tax applies. The rate is 7.1% for e.g. wages and 5% for e.g. life annuities, coming on top of the tax percentages mentioned above. The total income for which these rates apply is limited to ca. 50,000 euro.

==Tax on income from a substantial business interest (box 2)==
Prior to 2024, there was a flat tax of 26.9% on income from a substantial business interest, usually meaning a (direct or indirect) shareholding of at least 5% in a private limited company (&quot;BV&quot;). As of 2024, this has become a two-bracketed tax consisting of a rate of 24.5% on the first €67,000 of income and 33% on the excess.

If the fiscal partner of the taxpayer or a blood relative (first vertical kin) holds a substantial interest in a company, the shares of the taxpayer constitute a substantial interest, even if they do not amount to 5%.

Income from substantial interest includes:
* dividends
* capital gains (except in case of succession and divorce)

For 2007 only there was a reduced rate ranging from 22 to 25%.

See also box 2 .

==Tax on savings and investments (box 3)==
As of 2024, there is a tax of 36% on the assumed return on bank savings and other assets if their total value exceeds €57,000. Each type of investment has a different assumed rate of return associated with it.

There is an exemption for money invested in approved &quot;green&quot; investments up to a certain limit. Moreover, a tax credit per year of 0.7% of the value is applied for these investments. The credit only counts towards box 3.

See also box 3 .

==Threshold income==
The sum of the incomes in the three boxes is the &quot;threshold income&quot;. It determines thresholds for tax deductions, e.g. for gifts (see below).

The deductible amount is subtracted from the income in box 1; if this is not enough, the remainder is subtracted from the income in box 3, and finally from box 2.

==Gifts==
The Dutch Tax Service can declare an institution to be an &quot;institution for general benefit&quot; (&quot;algemeen nut beogende instelling&quot;, ANBI). Often this is a foundation (&quot;stichting&quot;). It can also be a voluntary association (&quot;vereniging&quot;), but not e.g. a sport club, or association of personnel. Also it cannot be a commercial institution.

If the sum of someone&#x27;s gifts to ANBIs exceeds 1% of the threshold income, the excess, with a maximum of 10% of that income, is deductible income.

==Total tax==
The total tax is the sum in the three boxes, minus the general tax credit (&quot;algemene heffingskorting&quot;, a maximum of €3070 as of 2023) and labor tax credit (&quot;arbeidskorting&quot;, a maximum of €5052 as of 2023) that both are income-dependent. These are not to be confused with a ). The resulting amount of tax may be less than zero, in which case the amount is partially paid out, provided that one has a spouse and the tax of both together is not less than zero.

==The 30% ruling==
The 30% ruling is a personal income tax reduction for select employees in the Netherlands. It applies to specialized foreign employees who are brought to the Netherlands because their skills are scarce in the Dutch marketplace. The scarcity of work force with particular skills is reviewed annually.
The 30 Percent Rule allows an employer to exempt from income tax up to 30% of the employee&#x27;s annual remuneration (the &quot;Basis&quot;) and used to be applicable for the first 10 years of their stay in the Netherlands, but is currently for the first five years of employment in the Netherlands Inkomstenbelasting Wet 2001.

The purpose of the 30 Percent Rule to compensate employees for the extra costs of their temporary stay in the Netherlands. The effect is to make the Netherlands competitive in the international marketplace for skilled labour, since normal Dutch income tax rates are high (in comparison with other countries) and may discourage some employees from accepting assignments in the Netherlands.

However, there are consequences for possible future unemployment aid, tax deduction for a mortgage, pension contributions, and other benefits.

The Dutch tax authority allows for two options:
* 30% tax-free is reimbursed based on registered receipts for extraterritorial costs (e.g. maintenance of an own house in the country of origin, travel expenses, relocation costs, language courses, long-distance telephone calls)
* the Dutch tax office can, upon an approved application of an employee, grant a 30% tax exemption on the employees remuneration.

In addition, the employer may provide a tax-free reimbursement for tuition fees when the employee&#x27;s children attend an international school.

The Dutch income tax law does not, however, specify how the benefit of the 30% rule should be divided between the employee and the employer. Some employers (e.g. Shell) have stipulated in their general working conditions that the 30% rule income tax benefit is solely for the benefit of the company, arguing that salaries of their local workers would not be on par with their foreign work force. The 30% rule income tax benefit is then divided between an employee and the employer up to the level as if the foreigner employer fictively paid the income tax on the entire salary and the surplus left to the company.

A similar rule also applies to compensate Dutch employees who are assigned to work in designated developing countries or to the Dutch nationals returning to the Netherlands after a substantial period of living abroad (10 years or longer).

Note that the formal application typically takes two to three months. The excess tax paid in the meantime will be repaid to the applicant once the 30% tax exemption is granted.

Eligibility for the 30 percent rule is subject to a set of conditions, including:
* The foreign employee was recruited outside the Netherlands or transferred from another country by their employer.
* The foreign employee possesses expertise absent or scarce in the Dutch labour market. Fulfilment of this condition is based upon gross salary, which must exceed a given minimum amount after the exemption is applied. In 2023, the threshold gross salary was €41,954 (€59,934 including the tax-free 30% allowance). A lower requirement applies for employees under the age of 30 who have obtained a master&#x27;s degree or its equivalent at a Dutch or foreign university; in 2023, the respective minimum gross salary amounted to €31,891 (€45,559 including the tax-free 30% allowance). No minimum salary threshold exists for researchers under EU directives.
* In the 24 months prior to first day of employment in the Netherlands, the foreign employee lived outside of the Netherlands for more than 16 months, more than 150 kilometres away from the Dutch border. An exception exists for all Ph.D. students who recently graduated (within the previous 12 months), where the 150 km distance rule need only have been met for 16 out of the 24 months before the start of Ph.D. study.

The applicable period was originally 10 years. New legislation came in to force as per 1 January 2012, limiting the applicable period of the rule from 10 to 8 years, with a 5-year transition period. Also, foreign students acquiring a PhD in the Netherlands are eligible for the 30% ruling, even though they were not hired from abroad &quot;Changes in 30% rule&quot;.
In 2017 the new governmental coalition planned to reduce the tax break from 8 years to 5 years. However, in the 2018 budget speech, the finance minister retroactively reduced the 30% tax rule to end by Jan 2019 for all beneficiaries if over 5 years, irrespective of an earlier approval for a later end date (many cases up to 2022).

== Tax treaties ==
The Netherlands has established nearly 100 bilateral tax treaties with other countries to prevent the issue of double taxation. The overview is available at the website Dutch Tax and Customs Administration.

<doc id="802433" wikidata="Q708859" url="?curid=802433" title="Isonokami Shrine">
<text>is a Shinto shrine located in the hills of Furu in Tenri, Nara Prefecture, Japan. It is one of the oldest extant Shinto shrines in Japan and has housed several significant artifacts.

Isonokami shrine was highly regarded in the ancient era, and frequented by many members of the Imperial Family. It played a pivotal role in Japan&#x27;s early history, especially during the 3rd to 5th centuries.

The shrine is at the northern end of the &quot;Yamanobe no michi&quot;, the oldest road in Japan.

==History==
It is unknown which kami was initially worshipped at Isonokami shrine. Isonokami Shrine was supposedly built in the 7th year of Emperor Sujin&#x27;s reign, or the 91 BC. However, there is little record of Sujin&#x27;s existence or identity, and therefore the claim is deemed legendary. The construction of a structure that can be identified as a Shinto shrine in the Isonokami area probably dates two or three centuries later. Despite this, it is not unlikely that the Isonokami area was considered a sacred site during that time, as archeological digs have found many ritual objects, and Isonokami worship was already firmly established when they were adopted by the Yamato leaders in the 4th century.

Early records show that the shrine was an emerging center of Yamato power, flavored with a military overtone. Archeological evidences shows that around the 4th century, Yamato kings and nobility constructed more and more palaces and buildings in the shrine&#x27;s vicinity. Prior to this, the Yamato leaders identified with kami worshipped at Mount Miwa, but may have turned to Isonokami for its martial implications. Myths written in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; clearly attempt to link the Yamato court to Isonokami shrine. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Emperor Suinin&#x27;s eldest son, ordered a thousand swords made and was placed in charge of Isonokami&#x27;s treasures. He then founded the Mononobe clan, who patronized the shrine for many generations. Indeed, many of the state&#x27;s iron weaponry were kept in the shrine&#x27;s storehouses. When the Mononobe clan collapsed, it was reformed as the Isonokami clan.

The shrine became the object of Imperial patronage during the early Heian period. In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered that Imperial messengers be sent to report important events to the guardian &quot;kami&quot; of Japan. These &quot;heihaku&quot; were initially presented to 16 shrines including the Isonokami Shrine.

From 1871 through 1946, the Isonokami Shrine was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.

==Architecture==
Isonokami shrine is surrounded by Cryptomeria (&quot;sugi)&quot;. A &quot;waka&quot; poem from the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; anthology mentions Isonokami shrine, surrounded by holy cedar trees.

The current site of Isonokami shrine may have been the site of an earlier religious structure, the Izumo-taisha. This is suspected because of a secondary shrine to Izumo-takeo found near the main shrine, but on higher ground. Since secondary shrines are never built higher than the principal shrine, some have concluded that it was an older structure that stood before the current one.

The honden, or main hall, is built in the &quot;nagare-zukuri&quot; style.

==Enshrined==
The main enshrined dedication is to , the kami of a legendary sword (&quot;futsu-no-mitama-no-tsurugi&quot;) that was given to by Takemikazuchi in Kumano and used by Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan. However, the sword itself is hidden in Isonokami shrine, but the second sword is visible in Kashima Shrine, Ibaraki.

==Artifacts==
The &quot;Nanatsusaya-no-Tachi&quot;, a seven-branched sword, is housed in Isonokami shrine. It was given to the Yamato king by the crown prince of Baekje, a kingdom on the Korean Peninsula. The sword has been kept in Isonokami shrine since ancient times, perhaps as early as the 4th century when it was received from Baekje. It was rediscovered in 1873, and its gold inlaid inscription has proven to be a valuable historical resource. The sword is currently not available for public viewing.

The &quot;Totsuka-no-Tsurugi&quot;, a legendary sword, is also said to be kept at Isonokami shrine. According to the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, the sword was used by the god Susanoo to slay the Yamata-no-Orochi, a giant serpent with eight heads and eight tails. Priests at the shrine do not allow anyone to see or inspect the sword.

Ten treasures brought by Amenohiboko are thought to be housed in Isonokami shrine. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Amenohiboko was a prince from Korea who settled in Japan. The ten treasures he brought are known as the &quot;&quot;, and they are as follows:
*Okitsu-kagami (A mirror)
*Hetsu-kagami (A mirror)
*Yatsuka-no-tsurugi (A sword)
*Iku-tama (A jewel)
*Makarukaheshi-tama (A jewel)
*Taru-tama (A jewel)

<text>The Longzhong Plan is the name given to a strategic plan by Zhuge Liang, a statesman of the Shu Han state in the Three Kingdoms period (220–280) of China. Zhuge Liang presented the plan to Liu Bei, a warlord who became the founding emperor of the Shu Han state, sometime in 207 towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty when Liu Bei visited him at his residence in Longzhong (隆中), an area in the west of present-day Xiangyang, Hubei.

The Longzhong Plan formed the basis for the establishment of the Shu Han state. In essence, the plan required Liu Bei to gain control over Jing and Yi provinces, which covered present-day Hubei and Hunan, and Sichuan and Chongqing, respectively, so as to secure a viable base for staging attacks against Liu Bei&#x27;s rival, Cao Cao, and his territories in central and northern China. The plan also required Liu Bei to form a strategic alliance with another warlord, Sun Quan, who was based in eastern China.

==Details==
Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography in the historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, written by Chen Shou in the late third century, recorded the details of the private conversation between him and Liu Bei in his house in Longzhong. Liu Bei said: 

Zhuge Liang replied: 

The plan envisaged that Liu Bei would take over Jing and Yi provinces, both of which were governed by the warlords Liu Biao and Liu Zhang respectively. The Longzhong Plan noted that Cao Cao controlled the North China Plain, which was key to mastery of China, and that Sun Quan held the lower Yangtze River region, known as &quot;Jiangdong&quot;. In view of this, a move to occupy Jing and Yi provinces was vital for success. The essential outlines of the plan held remarkable foresight in envisaging the tripartite division of China. The other crucial aspect of the plan was the proposal for forming an alliance with Sun Quan in order to deter and resist Cao Cao. Other minor aspects included the institution of economic, legal and administrative reforms as well as developing cordial relations with the non-Han Chinese peoples located in the west and south. Such a policy would reduce resistance and increase much-needed manpower and economic resources. The culminating clause was a two-pronged northern campaign which would end in the seizure of the North China Plain and the reestablishment of the Han dynasty.

One advance would be from Yi Province in the west, north through the Qin Mountains, which debouches into the Wei River valley and achieving a strategic position in the west from which to dominate the great bend of the Yellow River and the Guanzhong region. The second advance would be from Jing Province north toward Luoyang, the old imperial capital of the Han dynasty, and the surrounding plains. Such a campaign would presumably occur at an opportune moment of destabilisation of Cao Cao&#x27;s regime but that moment was not specified. Nor was the role of Sun Quan in the offensives identified; though it would be assumed that he would tie down at least some of Cao Cao&#x27;s forces.

From 214 onwards, Liu Bei controlled both Jing and Yi provinces after seizing Yi Province from Liu Zhang. In 219, he won a decisive victory over Cao Cao and occupied Hanzhong Commandery. That autumn, his commander in Jing Province, Guan Yu, struck north against Cao Cao&#x27;s positions on the Han River. This offensive may have been part of the planned two-pronged attack. For the first few months, Guan Yu&#x27;s attack was remarkably successful and Cao Cao even considered evacuating the imperial capital, Xuchang. At this point, however, Sun Quan took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and rapidly seized Jing Province. Liu Bei tried unsuccessfully to recapture Jing Province during the Battle of Xiaoting of 222–223, and died shortly thereafter. Even with the loss of Jing Province, Zhuge Liang may have attempted to carry out a modified version of the Longzhong Plan in the form of the Northern Expeditions, although it is arguable that those campaigns had different tactical and strategic goals.

== Criticism ==
The Qing dynasty scholar Wang Fuzhi was critical of the strategic goal of the Longzhong Plan because the two-pronged offensive that was intrinsic to the plan did not make a distinction as to which prong was the decoy and which was the main force. He alludes to the plan as being without any subtlety: such as using the &quot;make a sound in the east but strike in the west&quot; (聲東擊西 &quot;shēng dōng jī xī&quot;). Nor did it incorporate any hint of the interplay between &quot;zheng&quot; (正) and &quot;qi&quot; (奇) - the orthodox, apparent, and overt military operation and a surprise, covert, or unexpected military action which brings about victory for a weaker force. Wang Fuzhi notes that one who seeks to seize the empire from a comparatively weak position must be flexible in strategic planning in order to grasp the opportunity to use &quot;qi&quot; to obtain victory.

Others charge that the political goal of the Longzhong Plan was flawed because the restoration of the Han dynasty was unrealistic. The Cao Wei state, which Zhuge Liang considered to be an illegitimate successor to the Han dynasty, had effectively dealt with economic and political issues and had gained the support of the people. The military historians at the Military Science Academy in Beijing view Zhuge Liang&#x27;s political goal as inappropriate and unrealistic even in 207 when the plan was formulated and totally irrelevant by the time of the Northern Expeditions. The idea of seizing Jing Province in the Longzhong Plan was a flawed concept because Sun Quan would never accept Liu Bei in control of this critical area, crucial for the security of his base in Jiangdong. In essence, Zhuge Liang is charged with failing to make an objective analysis of the political situation in 207.

<text>Commandant Eric Lassard is a fictional character in the 1984 film &quot;Police Academy&quot;, as well as its six sequels. He was portrayed by George Gaynes.

== Character arc ==
Commandant Lassard is introduced as head of the Metropolitan Police Academy (sometimes also called the Midcity Police Academy). Unlike many of his colleagues in administration, he is never politically reactionary in response to changes in the police force or changes to his academy, although he appears uninterested in police politics in general. When Police Chief Henry J. Hurst and Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris are denouncing the new female mayor&#x27;s policy change to remove race and gender as barriers to academy admissions, he plays along with them. After they leave, he quickly dismisses their comments, and he is the only one shown to oppose Hurst and Harris&#x27;s plans to weed out the new cadets. After Lassard&#x27;s first successful run with the new recruits, Police Chief Hurst changes his outlook and realizes that Lassard was right in giving them a chance. In &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot;, however, he initiated a program known as Citizens on Patrol (COP), which is a community outreach course.

Lassard is portrayed as being fond of his job, proud of the academy, and supportive of his cadets. He is also comically odd: he is rarely seen without his pet goldfish; frequently travels by golf cart; and is prone to accidentally destroying things (similar to fellow officer Sgt. Douglas Fackler), e.g., by playing golf inside his office. He can sometime be absent-minded, and a running joke in the series is that he becomes so lost in thought that he is carried away—usually figuratively, as in his signature repetition of the words &quot;many&quot; and &quot;very&quot; (e.g., &quot;Have a very, very, very good day,&quot; or &quot;This is very, very... very bad&quot;), but sometimes literally, as when he starts to pace while giving a speech and wanders far from his audience. Lassard is an astounding trick shot at billiards, once clearing an entire pool table in a single shot, much to the astonishment of the local bar players.

Lassard nearly loses his job three times in the series. In &quot;Police Academy 3: Back in Training&quot;, the Metropolitan Police Academy, now a semi-statewide institution, is pitted against the state&#x27;s other police academy in a competition to decide which school will survive budget cuts. In &quot;Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach&quot;, Lassard reaches the mandatory retirement age. This is brought to his superiors&#x27; attention by Captain Harris, and Lassard&#x27;s retirement is announced to the surprise of everyone (including himself) at the subsequent graduation ceremony. He flies with his contingent to Miami Beach, Florida to be honored as Police Officer of the Decade at the National Police Chiefs&#x27; Convention. While in Miami, he inadvertently foils a jewel thief&#x27;s escape, earning him and his men and women medals from the city. As a result, back in his home state, his superiors waive his mandatory retirement and allow him to continue to serve as long as he wishes. His age seems to be approximately 70 years old. In &quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot;, the criminal mastermind who has begun to seize control of the city attempts to frame Lassard for a jewel heist by planting stolen jewelry in his desk at the Oakdale Station, where he has been leading a task force. As a result, Lassard is suspended from active duty, until Nick and Hightower prove that he is innocent (and that Harris had been leaking information to the thieves to keep them ahead of the police and humiliate Lassard and his men).

Comdt. Lassard&#x27;s family consists mainly of his wife, seen briefly during the first movie and never named, and a younger brother, Captain Pete Lassard (played by Howard Hesseman), whose precinct has a horrendous crime rate until the fresh graduates from Comdt. Lassard&#x27;s academy bring down an enormous gang. A nephew (possibly Pete&#x27;s son), Nick Lassard, is with the Miami Police but leaves to join Eric in &quot;Police Academy 6&quot;.

Lassard has other nephews in the animated series.

<text>A nuno sa punso (&quot;old man of the mound&quot;), or simply nuno (&quot;old man&quot; or &quot;grandparent&quot; &quot;ancestor&quot;), is a dwarf-like nature spirit (&quot;anito&quot;) in Philippine mythology. It is believed to live in an anthill or termite mound, hence its name, literally &#x27;Ancestor/Grandparent living in the anthill&#x27;.

==Description==
The &quot;nuno&quot; are the spirits of the ancestors. When a tree is to be felled, or a piece of virgin ground broken, or on many other occasions, permission is asked of the &quot;nuno&quot;, in order to avoid the misfortune that would come from angering it. The &quot;nuno&quot; is described to be a small old man with a long beard, but differs from a dwende or dwarf of Philippine folklore. The dwende is a playful hobgoblin who shows himself to children, while the &quot;nuno&quot; is a goblin easily angered that will do harm to those who damage or disturb his mound, and will seek retribution, for example by causing the foot of someone who kicked his mound to become swollen. &quot;Nuno sa punso&quot; are also believed to inhabit places such as underneath large rocks, trees, riverbanks, caves, or a backyard.

==Magical abilities==
Nunos have the ability to curse trespassers. A curse may include the following:
* Swelling or pain on any part of the body
* Vomiting of blood
* Urinating black liquid
* Excessive hair growth on the back

In order for a nuno to successfully curse a person, the trespasser must be in close proximity to the nuno. If the trespasser is within range, the Nuno can spit on any part of the trespasser&#x27;s body. The trespasser will then experience aches or soreness on the affected part of the body, such as stomach pains, swollen genitals (after urinating on the mound), or swollen feet (after kicking the mound).

==Countering &quot;nuno&quot; curses==
It is a common belief in the Philippines that if modern medicine is unable to cure a particular illness, the ailment may be due to a &quot;nuno&quot;″s curse. The victim is brought to an &quot;albularyo&quot;, a Philippine practitioner of traditional medicine. The &quot;albularyo&quot; will perform a type of divination known as &quot;pagtatawas&quot;. During this ritual, a burning piece of alum (&quot;tawas&quot;) or a candle is melted and poured onto a disc or spoon. The molten matter is then dribbled over a basin of water, allowing the alum or wax to cool and form shapes on the water&#x27;s surface. These will then be interpreted by the &quot;albularyo&quot; as signs pointing to the cause of the patient&#x27;s illness and whether a curse has transpired.

In order to be cured, the victim&#x27;s family may be asked to provide an offering to the nuno such as fruits or other food, drink, or a material object. If the victim is still sick after the offering, it may be necessary to personally ask the nuno&#x27;s forgiveness, which is believed to be a wise measure in order to prevent permanent possession of the victim by an evil spirit, which could later cause insanity.

It is also possible to kill the nuno by catching it and crushing its head between a person&#x27;s fingers or thighs. This will remove any spell cast by the nuno. But this method is often not recommended as it could incur the wrath of a nuno&#x27;s kin and friends.

Nunos are protectors of the Earth, and have the ability to sense goodness and evil. If you radiate purity, they are able to tell, and will often reveal themselves. If you have skepticism, cynicism or darkness, they will avoid you or make you ill so you stay away from the area. When countryside becomes modernized and urbanized, the nunos often flee, die, or go further down into the earth.

==Precautions==
To avoid the wrath of a nuno sa Punso, children are reminded not to play outside between noon and three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. They are also asked by their parents to come home before six o&#x27;clock in the evening. Children are also instructed to avoid being noisy at places where nuno are believed to dwell. Children are also warned to ask permission or give fair notice before passing by such places inhabited by the nuno, which is done by saying &quot;tabi tabi po&quot;(literally &quot;please be on the side&quot; or &quot;please move aside&quot;, that is, you tell the nuno to stand aside), or &quot;please let me pass by&quot; or &quot;I mean no harm as I pass through your territory, Old Man of the Mound&quot;.

==Disrespect==
Although most people that believe in the spirit respect the nuno and will abide by the many unwritten rules that ensure a peaceful coexistence between human beings and nuno, others will, for a variety of reasons, actively seek to disrespect or offend them. A disrespectful person will purposely trample around in tall grassy areas, places where nuno are also believed to inhabit or will intentionally urinate on suspected nuno anthills to display dominance over the mound dweller.

<text>A Baja Bug is an original Volkswagen Beetle modified as an all-terrain vehicle to operate off-road (open desert, sand dunes and beaches), although other versions of air-cooled Volkswagens are sometimes modified as well. Baja bugs often race in off-road desert races such as the Baja 1000. There are different classes for bugs, namely class 11, class 5 1600, and class 5 unlimited. According to desert racing association &quot;Score International&quot;, class 11 is a stock VW beetle with modifications limited to ground clearance and strength. Class 5 1600 rules state that a 1600 cc VW engine must be used and the car must have the exterior appearance of a &quot;baja bug&quot; with body modification limited to whatever cutting is needed to install a consumer baja kit. Class 5 unlimited is any 4 cylinder VW-style engine, and it must have Baja-style fenders and side panels, and VW-style suspension.. Another version of Baja Bug is &quot;Old Fusca&quot;, used for dirt racing in Paraná, Brazil. They are equipped with the AP engine from the early Volkswagen Golf generations, and can be feeded by carburetor or electronic injection.

==History==
Baja Bugs originated in Southern California in the late 1960s as an inexpensive answer to the successful Volkswagen-based dune buggies of the mid-1960s, especially the Meyers Manx.
The building of the first Baja Bug is generally credited to Gary Emory (now of Parts Obsolete), circa 1968. Gary and his hot rodder father, Neil Emory, built the car in the bodyshop at the Chick Iverson Volkswagen dealership in Newport Beach, California; Gary worked in the parts department there after leaving school and Neil was working in the bodyshop. The first Baja Bug in racing is credited to Dave Deal, the Californian cartoonist, in the Mexican 1000 of 1968 in Baja California. The first fiberglass Baja kit (bug eye kit) was not introduced until 1969 by the Miller-Havens company. The original &quot;Bugeye&quot; kit by Miller-Havens Enterprises was widely copied - Drino Miller estimated that at least 8 of the original 10 kits sold were “Splashed” (used to make copy moulds). Miller-Havens modified the rear panels of the original Bugeye kit in mid 1971 to add a longer engine cowl and longer rear fenders that original VW Bug rear lights could be mounted to. It was this 1971 kit that inspired the Tamiya Sand Scorcher radio controlled Baja Bug. The 1971 update was also due to updated regulations in California regarding engine coverage. In many US states and other countries, the headlight spacing of the Bugeye kits was illegal - the headlights were close together in the front panel, similar to early Land Rovers. In mid-1972, Don Rountree of the Sandwinder Company/R&amp;H Fiberglass launched the first wide-eye Baja bug kit (Designed by Barry &quot;Burly&quot; Burlile) - the headlights of the Sandwinder kit were mounted in the front fenders and the rear panels were much longer. The Sandwinder one-piece flip front was then used on the majority of Baja racers cars.

In the early days before fiberglass body panels became available, enthusiast and racers simply made their own modification to both the body and mechanicals of a stock VW to develop a machine suited to harsh, off-road environments. The metal fenders and front and rear aprons of the car would be partially cut away to allow more for ground clearance and suspension travel. This came to be known as a &quot;Cut Baja&quot; but at the time these cars were referred to as “Choppers” in magazines. As much as California gained the reputation for inventing the Baja Bug, Choppers/Cut Bajas were also widespread in Michigan from the early 1960s; they were called &quot;Muckers&quot; in Michigan - Reference Petersen Complete Volkswagen Book No. 2 (1971). More power was attained by fitting dual port heads and modifying fuel injection systems from Volkswagen Type 3 engines to work on the Type 1 Beetle engine. Some installed the larger, 1.7, 1.8 and 2.0 Volkswagen Type 4 or Porsche 914 engine. Corvair engine transplants were another common way of achieving a large power hike.

==Conversion==
Basic modifications are simple. A lightweight, shortened fiberglass front body panel is fitted after the sheet metal from the trunk lid edge forward and rear engine deck lid and everything rearward (rear apron and engine compartment) is removed. The rear treatment leaves the engine totally exposed to aid in cooling. A tubular steel cage, along with a front and rear bumper, is fitted to the body and floor pan for protection of engine and occupants. Shortened fiberglass fenders both front and rear meant removal of the Beetle&#x27;s distinctive running boards and the likely addition of more tubular steel parts (side bars) in their place. The rugged torsion bar front and rear suspension standard on the Beetle, allows it to withstand the rigors of offroading and the rear ride height to easily be raised slightly and stiffened to make clearance for larger heavy-duty off-road tires and wheels. The relatively light front end of the Beetle allows some compensation for the lack of four wheel drive. The taller sidewall tires provide more flexible ride comfort and rocky road ground clearance. The Beetle suspension &quot;stops&quot; can be moved to allow more suspension travel. Longer shock absorbers, for the increase in suspension travel, provide more damping control over bumps giving more driver control and comfort. Some people eliminate the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage, allowing extreme amounts of travel with a very comfortable ride. There are two basic styles, The Narrow and Wide Eye Baja Bug. The Narrow Eye (Bugeye) places the headlights on the front apron (see picture below); while, the Wide Eye has the headlights on the front fenders in more or less the stock location.

<doc id="802486" wikidata="Q181572" url="?curid=802486" title="Peperoncino">
<text>Peperoncino (; : &quot;peperoncini&quot;) is the generic Italian name for hot chili peppers, specifically some regional cultivars of the species &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot; and &quot;C. frutescens&quot; (chili pepper and Tabasco pepper, respectively). The sweet pepper is called &quot;peperone&quot; (: &quot;peperoni&quot;) in Italian. Like most peppers, the fruit is green or yellowish-green when young, and ripens to a red colour.

==History==
The &quot;peperoncino&quot; probably came to Italy around the 15th century, when Southern Italy was under Spanish dominion. It was likely an export from the new world among other plants new to Europe such as the tomato. Like the tomato, the &quot;peperoncino&quot; was first considered a decorative and possibly poisonous plant before it was adopted into Italian cuisine. It might have become popular as a food long before the cookbooks attest to its use; these cookbooks were written for the upper classes, while the &quot;peperoncino&quot; was a cheap and convenient food for the lower classes.

Pietro Andrea Mattioli first described &quot;peperoncini&quot; in 1568 and mentioned how much hotter they were than other varieties of pepper from Asia. The earliest surviving published use of &quot;peperoncino&quot; in a recipe dates to a 1694 cookbook by the Italian chef Antonio Latini. In his recipe for &quot;salsa alla spagnola&quot;, chopped &quot;peperoncini&quot;, tomatoes, and some onion are combined with peppermint, salt, and oil, to be served as a relish.

==Culinary use==

In Italian cuisine &quot;peperoncini&quot; are used with moderation and the flavour is considered more important than the heat. As a consequence the Scoville rating serves only as a rough guide to the heat, which is quite varied among the different cultivars.

The &quot;peperoncino&quot; is especially important in Calabrian cuisine. In late summer, &quot;peperoncini&quot; are stitched on wires and hung from buildings. They are left to dry in spots with sunlight and ventilation to conserve them, allowing their use in cooking until the next harvest. They are eaten whole, fried until crisp, crushed, pickled, powdered or as a paste. A typical &quot;peperoncino&quot; from Calabria rates 15,000 to 30,000 on the Scoville scale.
Notable Calabrian dishes which use &quot;peperoncini&quot; are the condiments &quot;bomba calabrese&quot;, chili oil and the spreadable pork sausage &#x27;nduja. It is also used in dishes of other regional cuisines of southern and central Italy, such as the Roman-style arrabbiata sauce and the Apulian &quot;orecchiette alle cime di rapa&quot; (orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe).

While most crushed red pepper (a common component of spicy Italian-style cuisine and frequently sprinkled on pizza and other dishes) in North America is today made from cayenne or jalapeño peppers common in that region, some specialty markets there supply imported Italian red &quot;peperoncino&quot; flakes.

==Culture==
Since 1992 the annual Peperoncino Festival has been held in the town of Diamante, Calabria. Organized by the Accademia Italiana del Peperoncino, the festival now attracts tens of thousands of visitors. It is held for four days surrounding the first weekend of September on the town&#x27;s seaside promenade. The festival has a large market where local food products made with &quot;peperoncini&quot; are sold, and hosts a &quot;peperoncino&quot;-eating contest. Calabrian chili oil is a popular international export.

<text>Matthew Lawrence (born Matthew William Mignogna; February 11, 1980) is an American actor, podcaster and singer, widely known for his roles in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; and &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. Lawrence also starred in the series &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; with his real-life brothers Joey and Andrew.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania to Donna Lynn (&quot;née&quot; Shaw), a personnel manager and former elementary school teacher, and Joseph Lawrence Mignogna Jr., an insurance broker. His family&#x27;s stage surname was changed to Lawrence from Mignogna when he was a toddler. The middle-born of three boys, he has two brothers, Joey and Andrew, both of whom are also actors. Lawrence attended classes at Abington Friends School.

==Career==
Lawrence began acting in the mid-1980s, playing Danny Carrington in &quot;Dynasty&quot;. He studied acting at HB Studio in New York City. He continued as a child actor through the early 1990s, appearing in many television and feature film roles, including the Robin Williams comedy &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993) and the mid-1990s television series &quot;Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad&quot;. In addition, he maintained starring roles in &quot;Brotherly Love&quot;, which starred his real life brothers, and in &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; in which he played Jack Hunter. Lawrence also appeared alongside Christopher Lloyd in &quot;Angels in the Endzone&quot; and starred in the Disney English dub version of &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; with Kirsten Dunst and Phil Hartman in 1998.

Lawrence&#x27;s singing debut was in 1986, when he and his brother Joey performed at the 1986 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. He sang at the 1991 Macy&#x27;s Parade as well. Other musical performances can be found on two &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; episodes, &quot;Nell&#x27;s Secret Admirer&quot; and &quot;The Window; Part 1&quot;; two &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; episodes, &quot;A Roman Holiday&quot; and &quot;Art Attack&quot;; and on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. In the 2021 film &quot;Mistletoe Mixup&quot;, he performed &quot;O Holy Night&quot; with his brothers Joey and Andrew. Lawrence also played guitar on several of his earlier performances.

In 2011, Lawrence guest-starred on his brother&#x27;s sitcom, ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot;.

In 2015, he reprised his role as Jack Hunter in the series &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;, a spin-off/sequel of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;.

Lawrence competed on the twenty-fourth season of &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot;, the show&#x27;s seventh celebrity edition titled &quot;That″s So ″90s&quot;, which aired in April and May 2022.

In February 2023, the three Lawrence brothers launched a podcast, titled &quot;Brotherly Love&quot;, centered around rewatches of the sitcom. It was launched through PodCo, a podcast studio launched by actress Christy Carlson Romano and focused on rewatches of completed television series by their former actors.

==Music career==
In 2017, Matt started a band with Joey and Andy called Still Three. That February, they released their debut single &quot;Lose Myself&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lawrence briefly dated his &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; co-star Danielle Fishel. He was engaged to Heidi Mueller from 2004 to 2006. He began dating professional dancer Cheryl Burke in February 2007 and remained in a relationship with her until their breakup in 2008. The pair reunited in 2017 and became engaged on May 3, 2018. On May 23, 2019, they wed in San Diego, California. On February 23, 2022, after a prolonged estrangement exacerbated by COVID-19, it was reported that Burke filed for divorce. On September 19, 2022, the divorce was finalized. In 
late 2022, Lawrence began dating Chilli of the R&amp;B group TLC.
In April 2023, Lawrence revealed in a &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; podcast episode that he was sexually harassed by a director involved in a Marvel production and was fired by his agency when he walked out of the hotel room they were in.

<text>Symbiosis was a 70 mm documentary shown from October 1982 to January 1995 in the Harvest Theater at The Land pavilion at Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. It was directed by Paul Gerber and narrated by veteran voice-actor Philip L. Clarke.

The film focused on the balance between technological expansion and the protection of the environment. The film showed environmental damage caused by humans and what is being done to fix the damage created.

The film was projected on a 23x60 foot screen, and used a 13-track digital sound system.

It closed on January 1, 1995, and was replaced by &quot;Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable&quot;. The new film featured characters from Disney&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;The Lion King&quot; and included some re-edited footage from &quot;Symbiosis&quot;.

The film has since been shown at film festivals specializing in the 70 mm film format; at the National Media Museum in 1998, and in Karlsruhe, Germany in 2012.

<doc id="802524" wikidata="Q15524816" url="?curid=802524" title="Robert S. de Ropp">
<text>Robert Sylvester de Ropp (1913–1987) was an English biochemist and a researcher and academic in that field. After retiring from biochemistry, he brought other long-time personal interests to the fore, becoming a writer in the fields of human potentials and the search for spiritual realisation.

==Early life==
de Ropp was born in Bath, England, on February 1, 1913, the son of William de Ropp (originally Wilhelm von der Ropp) by his marriage to Ruth Fisher. The Ropp family had been land-owning barons in Lithuania. William was of Teutonic and Cossack descent, being entitled to use the title “Baron”, and was perpetually in shaky financial circumstances. He had settled in England in 1910 and become naturalised in 1913. de Ropp&#x27;s mother, Ruth, was a daughter of Albert Bulteel Fisher, whose brother was the academic historian Herbert William Fisher. Ruth de Ropp died in the 1918 flu pandemic. Robert de Ropp had also contracted the flu during the pandemic, and by the time he fully recovered from its ravages he was seven years old.

After de Ropp&#x27;s recovery from the flu, his father sent him as a boarder to a preparatory school, and during the school holidays he lived with various relations on his mother&#x27;s side, including an aunt in Leicestershire and a great aunt at Salisbury. This institution, Cheam School, offered the then-conventional curriculum of the Greek and Latin classics, English literature, and Muscular Christianity. Although subsequently questioning the premises of formal religion, de Ropp had his first spiritual experience during his confirmation.

In 1925 de Ropp&#x27;s father, being in financial difficulties, could not pay the school fees and took him out of the school. His father also remarried, and the family went to live on the old baronial estate in Lithuania. Shortly after relocating, de Ropp&#x27;s father obtained work as an agent for an aircraft company in Berlin and, taking his wife there with him, abandoned Robert in the rambling ruin of the family home, where he lived with a family of Latvians attached to the old Ropp baronial estate. He lived a rustic existence in Lithuania, left to his own devices and picking up the ways of the peasants. Two years later, when he was fourteen, his father shipped him off to the semi-desert south-Australian outback to live with, and work for, a hardscrabble-farm family. Three years later, the farmer went bankrupt amid dust storms. The farming family had to leave the lad to his own devices, and the situation made him bitter and confused. Lonely and nearly penniless, hard-bitten Robert eventually made his way back to England. 

At first, one of his maternal aunts took him in, then he moved to Dorking to live with one of his mother&#x27;s cousins, Adeline, the first wife of composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. She figured quite importantly in his development. The traumatized and embittered Robert de Ropp gained some perspective and matured during this period of support and advanced education. Like many intelligent, humane people of his time, de Ropp was appalled by the staggering destruction and carnage that had occurred during World War I. However, he was also dismayed by the spread of fascistic ideologies in Europe in the 1930s. Given his values and desire to commit himself to a positive effort, he allied with many other British intellectuals of similar inclination in Richard Sheppard’s Peace Pledge Union — only to find hopes for effective peaceful negotiation with the Nazis dashed when Germany invaded Poland and then France.

==Career as biochemist==
The Vaughan Williamses had paid for Robert’s further education at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, where he eventually specialized in biology. He earned a PhD degree in plant physiology at the Royal College. During this period, as well, he developed interests in politics, philosophy, and spirituality.

In this earlier portion of his life, de Ropp was active in plant physiology and cancer research. In 1939 he was at the Research Institute of Plant Physiology at Imperial College of Science and Technology in London. In the first quarter of 1939, at Paddington, he married Eileen M. Trinder, with whom he had lived for a number of years. He and Eileen had two children. During the Second World War, de Ropp worked as a bacteriologist and plant biologist. He met Kathleen Elizabeth (Betty) Knowlman during these years, when he was involved with research at Kew Gardens (England&#x27;s botanical research and education institution), at which Betty worked as a gardener. Betty later joined him in the United States after he moved there, at which time they married.

In the early 1940s, de Ropp wrote a number of research papers relating to plant physiology and tumours. By 1945 he was a Research Officer of the Agricultural Research Council at the Rothamsted Experimental Station. After emigrating to the U.S., de Ropp&#x27;s professional life included a stay at the Rockefeller Institute as a visiting investigator. At various times, his research was centered on cancer, mental illness, or drugs that affect behavior. During a ten-year period working for the Lederle Laboratories near Pearl River, New York, de Ropp wrote a book for the general reader in the field of psychoactive substances (many of which are plant-derived): &quot;Drugs and the Mind&quot;.

==Avocational interests==
de Ropp&#x27;s intense avocational interests, stemming largely from a spontaneous childhood spirituality, were nurtured by the influence of P. D. Ouspensky, whom he met in 1936. &quot;The work&quot; (as the Ouspensky disciplines were termed) was an approach to establishing an integrated human awareness at a higher level — considered to be a true inner freedom. de Ropp went regularly to Lyne Place for &quot;work&quot; weekends from 1936 to 1945 and was particularly attached to Madame Ouspensky as a deeply insightful guide, until 1940. In that year the Oupenskys emigrated from Britain to the United States; after living through war conditions in Britain, de Ropp joined the Ouspenskys there on a New Jersey farm in 1945, the European hostilities being past. However, de Ropp felt the Ouspenskys&#x27; &quot;milieu&quot; had by this point become stagnant and ineffective, and he became disillusioned about the work. &quot;Ouspensky was no longer a teacher,&quot; de Ropp opined in his autobiography.

After arriving in the U.S., Robert de Ropp, by his own efforts, built two houses, one in Connecticut, another in New York state; he and his second wife, Betty, lived in Rockland County, NY. de Ropp met G. I. Gurdjieff (the Ouspenskys&#x27; famous teacher) during Gurdjieff&#x27;s final visit to New York, in 1948.

==Years in Sonoma County ==
After working for the Lederle Laboratories for 10 years, de Ropp&#x27;s attachment to the northeast U.S. waned, and he felt a pull to the West Coast. In 1961 he purchased a small house on several acres, in Glen Ellen (slightly east of Santa Rosa, California), where the climate was mild and soil could be worked to high fertility. In time he became an independent writer and teacher — much concerned about humanity&#x27;s growing environmental and spiritual crises — and set up a learning community on his land around 1967 The idea behind it was experiential learning at the levels of body, mind, and spirit.

de Ropp&#x27;s family included the two children from his first marriage, and the children he had with his wife Betty. To support his family and finance their transition into the direct economy of living from the land and ocean, de Ropp worked until 1973 as a research scientist at the University of San Francisco. The family put down roots in their rural Sonoma-County locale, working at living simply. They grew fruits, vines, vegetables and wheat, as well as many ornamental plants. de Ropp fished in the ocean and Betty raised chickens. It was also during this time that de Ropp had an encounter with his neighbor, Hunter S. Thompson, that was immortalized in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In the book, Thompson writes that the name of the &quot;acid guru&quot; was &quot;redacted at insistence of [his] publisher&#x27;s lawyer,&quot; but in the original Rolling Stone article both Robert S. de Ropp and his residence on Sonoma Mountain Road are unredacted.

de Ropp wrote most of his books during his Sonoma County years. Among his most influential books (concerning spiritual development) are: &quot;The Master Game&quot; and &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Way: The Challenging Life Games&quot;. The first of these stands as his report on what he had learned from his teachers and from the writings of similar figures, as well as more mainstream psychologists, psychiatrists, and researchers into fields such as religion and the spiritual life. The second is in part a sequential biography, and was written near the end of his life; a significant dimension of its content is his very personal evaluation of the characters and contributions of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Madame Ouspensky, John G. Bennett (another direct disciple of Gurdjieff), Gerald Heard, Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, Stephen Gaskin, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda, and other figures serving as teachers of those engaged in spiritual quests. He is critical of those he views as false gurus or merely pompous, and attempts a fair-handed assessment of those he deems verbose but limited, whilst yet expressing genuine gratitude for those whose efforts he believes have enriched human life.

de Ropp died in 1987, in his mid seventies, in an accident while ocean-kayaking.

<doc id="802537" wikidata="Q5097736" url="?curid=802537" title="Child Labor Amendment">
<text>The Child Labor Amendment (CLA) is a proposed and still-pending amendment to the United States Constitution that would specifically authorize Congress to regulate &quot;labor of persons under eighteen years of age&quot;. The amendment was proposed on June 2, 1924, following Supreme Court rulings in 1918 and 1922 that federal laws regulating and taxing goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 and 16 were unconstitutional.

The majority of the state legislatures ratified the amendment by the mid-1930s; however, it has not been ratified by the requisite three-fourths of the states according to Article V of the Constitution and none has ratified it since 1937. Interest in the amendment waned following the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which implemented federal regulation of child labor with the Supreme Court&#x27;s approval in 1941.

The amendment was itself the subject of a 1939 Supreme Court decision, &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot; (307 U.S. 433), regarding its putative expiration. As Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, the amendment is still pending before the states. Ratification by an additional 10 states would be necessary for this amendment to come into force. In recent years, lawmakers in a handful of states have introduced resolutions to ratify the amendment.

==Text==
==Background==

With the Keating–Owen Act of 1916, the United States Congress had attempted to regulate interstate commerce involving goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 or 16, depending on the type of work. The Supreme Court found this law unconstitutional in &quot;Hammer v. Dagenhart&quot; (1918). Later that year, Congress attempted to levy a tax on businesses with employees under the ages of 14 or 16 (again depending on the type of work), which was struck down by the Supreme Court in &quot;Bailey v. Drexel Furniture&quot; (1922). It became apparent that a constitutional amendment would be necessary for such legislation to overcome the Court&#x27;s objections.

==Legislative history==

The amendment was offered by Ohio Republican Congressman Israel Moore Foster on April 26, 1924, during the 68th Congress, in the form of House Joint Resolution No. 184.

House Joint Resolution No. 184 was adopted by the United States House of Representatives on April 26, 1924, with a vote of 297 yeas, 69 nays, 2 absent and 64 not voting. It was then adopted by the United States Senate on June 2, 1924, with a vote of 61 yeas, 23 nays and 12 not voting. And with that, the proposed constitutional amendment was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification pursuant to Article V of the Constitution.

==Ratification history==
Having been approved by Congress, the proposed amendment was sent to the state legislatures for ratification and was ratified by the following 28 states:
# Arkansas – June 28, 1924
# California – January 8, 1925
# Arizona – January 29, 1925

# Pennsylvania – December 21, 1933 (After rejection – April 16, 1925)
# Wyoming – January 31, 1935
# Utah – February 5, 1935 (After rejection – February 4, 1925)
# Idaho – February 7, 1935 (After State House rejection – February 7, 1925)
# Indiana – February 8, 1935 (After State Senate rejection – February 5, 1925 and State House rejection – March 5, 1925)
# Kentucky – January 13, 1937 (After rejection – March 24, 1926)
# Nevada – January 29, 1937
# New Mexico – February 12, 1937 (After rejection – 1935)
# Kansas – February 25, 1937 (After rejection – January 30, 1925) 

During the 1920s and 1930s, the following fifteen state legislatures rejected the Child Labor Amendment and did not subsequently ratify it:
# Connecticut – February 11, 1925 (State Senate Rejection — February 5, 1925 and State House rejection – February 11, 1925)
# Delaware – 1925 (State Senate and State House Rejection — January 28 1925)
# Florida – 1925 (State Senate Rejection — April 15, 1925 and State House Rejection April 29, 1925)
# Georgia – August 6, 1924
# Louisiana – 1924, 1934 and 1936
# Maryland – March 18, 1927
# Massachusetts – Rejected by Voters in a referendum on November 4, 1924
# Missouri – 1925 (State Senate Rejection — March 20, 1925 and State House Rejection — March 3, 1925)
# North Carolina – August 23, 1924
# South Carolina – 1925 (State Senate Rejection — January 27, 1925 and State House Rejection — January 21, 1925)
# South Dakota – 1925, 1933 and 1937 
# Tennessee – 1925
# Texas – 1925 (State Senate Rejection — January 26, 1925 and State House Rejection — January 27, 1925)
# Vermont – 1925
# Virginia – 1926
Although the act, on the part of state legislatures, of &quot;rejecting&quot; a proposed constitutional amendment has no legal recognition, such action does have political ramifications.

Of the 48 states in the Union during the 1920s and 1930s, two have taken no action of record on the amendment: Alabama and Rhode Island. Meanwhile in Nebraska, that state&#x27;s Senate voted to ratify the CLA in 1929 (Nebraska&#x27;s Legislature did not become unicameral until 1937). In Mississippi, that state&#x27;s Senate voted to ratify the CLA in 1934. In New York, that state&#x27;s Senate voted to ratify the CLA in 1937. And in 2024, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted to ratify the CLA. As to Alaska and Hawaii—both of which became states in 1959—the Hawaii Senate voted to ratify the CLA in 2021 and again in 2022.

===Renewed ratification attempts and expressions of support===
In 2021 and 2022, a concurrent resolution to ratify the Child Labor Amendment passed in the Hawaii Senate with bipartisan support but stalled in the Hawaii House of Representatives. In 2024, a resolution to ratify the amendment passed in the Connecticut House of Representatives but was not brought up for a vote in the Connecticut Senate. Since 2018, ratification resolutions have also been introduced in New York, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Maryland, as was a resolution in Minnesota reaffirming that state&#x27;s ratification from 1933.

In 2024, the New Hampshire House of Representatives adopted—without action of the New Hampshire Senate—a unicameral House Resolution reaffirming support for the 1933 ratification of the Child Labor Amendment by the full New Hampshire General Court which, despite its judicial sound, is the official name of New Hampshire&#x27;s legislature. That unicameral House Resolution was formally received on November 14, 2024, by the United States Senate—as noted in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; of that date—and was duly referred to the Senate&#x27;s Committee on the Judiciary as reflected in the &quot;Record&quot;.

Supporters of ratification, such as University of San Diego School of Law professor Jessica Heldman and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Michael Hiltzik, have argued that the amendment could strengthen existing federal child labor protections, especially with some states loosening their child labor laws in recent years. Nebraska State Senator Carol Blood, who introduced a resolution to ratify the amendment, stated that it would only be &quot;ratifying what is already in law&quot;, and making a statement that Nebraska &quot;missed an opportunity to do better&quot;. In Connecticut, a ratification resolution was supported by the state&#x27;s AFL-CIO chapter and other union leaders. The amendment is supported by the Child Labor Coalition.

Presently, there being 50 states in the Union, the amendment will remain inoperative unless it is ratified by the legislatures of an additional 10 states to reach the necessary threshold of approval by 38 state legislatures.

==Judicial history==

Only five states adopted the amendment in the 1920s. Ten of the states initially balked, then re-examined their position during the 1930s and decided to ratify. These delayed decisions resulted in many controversies and resulted in the 1939 Supreme Court case &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot; (307 U.S. 433) in which it was determined that the Child Labor Amendment remained pending before the state legislatures because the 68th Congress did not specify any deadline. The ruling also formed the basis of the unusual and belated ratification of the 27th Amendment which was proposed by Congress in 1789 and ratified more than two centuries later in 1992 by the legislatures of at least three-fourths of the 50 states.

The common legal opinion on federal child labor regulation reversed in the 1930s. Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 regulating the employment of those under 16 or 18 years of age. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of that law in &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot; (1941), which overturned &quot;Hammer v. Dagenhart&quot; – one of the key decisions that had motivated the proponents of the Child Labor Amendment. After this shift, the amendment has been described as &quot;moot&quot; and lost the momentum that had once propelled it; hence, the movement for it has advanced no further.

If ever ratified by the required number of U.S. state legislatures, the Child Labor Amendment would repose in the Congress of the United States shared jurisdiction with the states to legislate on the subject of child labor.

==Opposition==

In 1933, J. Gresham Machen, who was a major voice at the time for Evangelical Fundamentalism and conservative politics, delivered a paper called &quot;Mountains and Why We Love Them&quot;, which was read before a group of ministers in Philadelphia on November 27, 1933. In passing, Machen mentions the CLA and rhetorically asks &quot;Will the so-called &#x27;Child Labor Amendment&#x27; and other similar measures be adopted, to the destruction of all the decencies and privacies of the home?&quot;

<doc id="802539" wikidata="Q1798630" url="?curid=802539" title="Real Life (webcomic)">
<text>Real Life is an American webcomic drawn and authored by Maelyn Dean. It began on November 15, 1999, and is still updated, after breaks from December 10, 2015, to September 10, 2018, and again from July 16, 2019, to June 15, 2020, from December 6, 2022 to February 26, 2024, and most recently, from April 9, 2024, to present. The comic is loosely based around the lives of fictionalized versions of Dean and her friends, including verbatim conversations, as well as fictional aspects including time travel and mecha combat. Characters regularly break the fourth wall. &quot;Real Life&quot; focuses on humor related to video games and science fiction, and references internet memes.

==Development==
&quot;Real Life&quot; launched in 1999 and became part of Keenspot shortly after. Dean switched to the Blank Label Comics collective in 2005 before going solo again in February 2010. The &quot;Real Life&quot; website is currently self-hosted by Dean.

Year one of &quot;Real Life&quot; was published as a paperback by Starline Multimedia Inc. in 2004, and a second book published by Lulu was released in 2008. A German translation of some portions of the webcomic has been made available on the website&#x27;s archive.

==Characters==
*Greg / Maelyn (Maelyn Dean) - The main character of the strip, and a fictional representation of the author of the comic. She seems to vacillate between being the voice of reason and the voice in need of reason. She is also very fond of Pepsi, to the point of addiction, going so far as to import Mexican Pepsi because it contains real sugar instead of corn syrup. She used to work as a fuel jock at a small airport, but eventually attended and graduated from culinary school. She previously lived in Sacramento and Rancho Cordova, both California, but moved to San Francisco - and moved again to Lockhart, Texas, but moved back to the California area, where she is once again roommates with Dave and Tony. (In June 2020, the author came out as transgender. Older comics before this point will feature Greg, and newer comics will feature Maelyn.)
*Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Dean (née Van Buskirk) - Maelyn&#x27;s wife, and an avid cosplayer; most of the strips have her acting as straight man in contrast to Maelyn&#x27;s antics. She started out as &quot;Lizzy&quot; to avoid confusion between the &quot;Liz&quot; that had already appeared in the comic and this new Liz. Eventually, the old Liz was phased out and now the new one is called Liz. Liz and Maelyn married in March 2005.
*Tony Flansaas - The comic&#x27;s resident evil overlord, and the fulcrum on which most of Real Life&#x27;s more far-fetched story lines revolve. They have made many attempts over the course of the comic&#x27;s existence to take over the world, and has even succeeded a couple of times.
*Dave Reynolds - Resident powergamer and supernerd. While the real Dave&#x27;s currently in the Navy, that doesn&#x27;t stop him from showing up and adding some of his cynical, nerdy point of view to a strip. Dave rivals Tony in technical ability. However, whereas Tony seems to be a genius in all subjects, Dave&#x27;s genius seems to lie mostly in computers. In one of the earlier comic strips, Dave upgraded his computer into a sentient being. The computer, PAL, went on to become a minor character in the strip, and was joined over time by several other technologically improved computers and consoles. 
*Crystal - Maelyn&#x27;s girlfriend when the strip started, but they broke up in 2001. She is no longer mentioned or appears in the strip, but was an integral part of the first year of the strip.
*The Cartoonist - Cartoonist Maelyn primarily appears in the strip to make an announcement, to answer questions that readers occasionally send her or to complain about a possible lack of ideas for the strip. Her appearance originally was differentiated from her comic counterpart by a change of colours (light brown overshirt, black tee with white stripes), and slightly shaggy hair. When the character came out as transgender, the Cartoonist was differentiated with longer hair and a different outfit.
*Harper Dean - a daughter of Maelyn and Liz. Born on July 29, 2011.

==Reception==
Maelyn Dean won the &quot;Outstanding Reality Comic&quot; category of the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards four times: in 2001, 2003 (when her webcomic tied with &quot;Nowhere Girl&quot;), 2004, and 2005 (when her webcomic tied with &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Panties&quot;).

==Collected editions==
* &quot;Real Life: The Year One Collection&quot;. Starline Multimedia Inc. 2004-08-25. 
* &quot;Real Life: The Greg&#x27;s Notes Edition&quot;. Lulu. 2008

<doc id="802559" wikidata="Q2036654" url="?curid=802559" title="1988 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1988 Atlantic hurricane season was a near average season that proved costly and deadly, with 15 tropical cyclones directly affecting land. The season officially began on June 1, 1988, and lasted until November 30, 1988, although activity began on May 30 when a tropical depression developed in the Caribbean. The June through November dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first cyclone to attain tropical storm status was Alberto on August 8, nearly a month later than usual. The final storm of the year, Tropical Storm Keith, became extratropical on November 24. The season produced 19 tropical depressions of which 12 attained tropical storm status. One tropical storm was operationally classified as a tropical depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Five tropical cyclones reached hurricane status of which three became major hurricanes reaching Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. It was later surpassed 34 years later until the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, to have Atlantic-Pacific crossover.

There were two notable cyclones of the season, the first one being Hurricane Gilbert, which at the time was the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record. The hurricane tracked through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and caused devastation in Mexico and many island nations, particularly Jamaica. Its passage caused $2.98 billion in damage (1988 USD) and more than 300 deaths, mostly in Mexico. The second one was Hurricane Joan, which struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane and caused about US$1.87 billion in damage and more than 200 deaths. The hurricane crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Miriam. Hurricane Debby also successfully crossed over, becoming Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, making the 1988 season the first on record in which more than one tropical cyclone has crossed between the Atlantic and Pacific basins intact.

==Seasonal forecasts==
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which four to eight reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach &quot;major hurricane&quot; status. 
==Seasonal summary==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, but activity in 1988 began two days earlier with the formation of Tropical Depression One on May 30. It was an above average season in which 19 tropical depressions formed. Twelve depressions attained tropical storm status, and five of these attained hurricane status, of which three reached major hurricane status. Four hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 550 deaths and $4.86 billion in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Keith, dissipated on November 24, only 6 days before the official end of the season on November 30.

The activity in the first two months of the season was limited because of strong wind shear from an upper tropospheric flow. Although vigorous tropical waves moved off the coast of Africa, most of them quickly diminished in intensity as they crossed the tropical Atlantic Ocean. As a result, no tropical depressions formed in June or July. Decreased wind shear in August allowed tropical waves to develop into tropical cyclones. The official storm track forecast errors were lower than the average for the previous 10 years. The forecasts were the most accurate in more than 18 years and were also more accurate than in each subsequent season until 1996.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 103, which is classified as &quot;near normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

==Systems==

===Tropical Depression One===
The first tropical depression of the season formed on May 30 in the northwest Caribbean Sea. The system encountered unfavorable conditions as it moved northward toward Cuba, and a reconnaissance airplane sent to investigate it could not find a well-defined center. The depression remained weak and degenerated on June 2 into an open trough of low pressure in the Florida Straits.

Rainfall from the depression and its precursor peaked at , including a daily peak of . The rainfall most affected the province of Cienfuegos, though the provinces of Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus, Ciego de Ávila, and Camagüey were also impacted. A tornado in the city of Camagüey destroyed five Soviet planes and multiple buildings. Flooding prompted officials to use rescue crews, helicopters, and amphibious vehicles to evacuate 65,000 residents in low-lying areas to higher grounds. The storm left many without power and communications, severely damaged the country&#x27;s transportation infrastructure, and destroyed six bridges. Flooding from the depression damaged 1,000 houses and destroyed 200 homes in Camagüey Province alone. Throughout Cuba, the depression affected about 90,000 people, injuring dozens and killing a total of 37 people, including three who died from electrocution. In Florida, the depression produced light rain, including at Pompano Beach.
===Tropical Storm Alberto===

The season&#x27;s first named storm originated on August 4 within a weak trough of low pressure that formed off the coast of South Carolina. The next day a low level circulation was detected by satellite, indicating that a tropical depression was forming. By August 6 the storm was designated the second tropical depression of the season. An approaching weak frontal trough pushed the depression northeastward and enhanced its upper-level outflow. On August 7 the system was designated Tropical Storm Alberto at 41.5°N, while located just south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, becoming the northernmost system to intensify into a tropical storm on record. The storm accelerated northeastward at and struck western Nova Scotia that evening with little impact. On August 8 Alberto became extratropical over the cold waters of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Shortly thereafter it dissipated just north of Newfoundland.

The storm produced peak wind gusts of at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. Rainfall reached in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in a short amount of time. The rainfall caused localized flooding, which briefly closed some streets. The extratropical remnants of Alberto also produced light rain and some clouds along western Newfoundland.
===Tropical Storm Beryl===
The third tropical depression of the season formed on August 7 from a surface low over southeastern Louisiana. The slow moving system organized as it drifted toward the mouth of the Mississippi River. It soon had enough convective organization for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to issue an initial advisory on Tropical Depression Three. By August 8 surface winds increased enough to issue tropical storm warnings for Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Over the open Gulf, Beryl produced sustained winds of minimal tropical storm force and tropical storm force gusts over coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Excessive rain fell along the central Gulf Coast, including local amounts of at Dauphin Island, Alabama.

Maintaining a well-structured outflow, Beryl&#x27;s circulation on August 9 moved over warm water, where conditions were favorable for further intensification. However, a front approached from the northwest and reversed the storm&#x27;s course into southeastern Louisiana. The next morning Beryl had weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over the Bayou Teche. Heavy downpours from system&#x27;s remnants brought more than of rain to parts of eastern Texas. Overall damage from the storm was light, and only one known death was attributed to the storm.
===Tropical Depression Four===

On August 12 a westward-moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Four near the southern Bahamas. The depression tracked north-northwest along Florida&#x27;s coast and made landfall near Jacksonville, Florida, the next day. The system spawned gusty winds and thunderstorms along the coasts of Florida and Georgia but caused little damage. The storm moved over south Georgia and the central Gulf Coast while dropping up to of rain on the Southeast. According to the National Weather Service, winds in some squalls to the north and east of the center reached up to . The system finally dissipated as it reemerged over water near the mouth of the Mississippi.

Early predictions from hurricane forecasters said that the depression would strengthen into the season&#x27;s third tropical storm. Because of unfavorable upper-level conditions and interaction with Bahama islands, the system lost its well defined center as it moved towards Florida&#x27;s east coast.
===Tropical Depression Five===

A tropical wave in the far eastern Atlantic developed into the fifth tropical depression on August 20. The storm drifted north-northwest of the Cape Verde islands for the next three days with little change in strength. Forecasters were concerned because the depression formed in the breeding ground where other powerful East Coast hurricanes have started. Though the storm was still very weak, they initially predicted it would strengthen.

By August 24 the depression&#x27;s forward speed had increased to as its movement turned west. Cool ocean temperatures weakened the system and diminished its prospects for restrengthening, and on August 26 Tropical Depression Five degenerated into a tropical wave. The remnants redeveloped on August 30 about southeast of North Carolina, and the Washington office of the National Weather Service continued to track the system as a gale center until it merged with a front off the East Coast on September 1.
===Tropical Depression Six===

Tropical Depression Six developed from a tropical wave that moved off the northwest African coast on August 12. The system crossed the tropical Atlantic as a wave until it began organizing near 55° W on August 19. The next day this system was designated a tropical depression while it approached the Windward Islands. After crossing the islands, the depression continued westward into the central Caribbean and encountered less-favorable conditions. Though poorly organized on August 21, the depression was expected to strengthen into a tropical storm over the western Caribbean&#x27;s warmer waters. Nevertheless, it was downgraded to a tropical wave at 80° W near the island of Jamaica on August 23. The disturbance moved over Central America with minimal convection but redeveloped into Hurricane Kristy once it reached the eastern Pacific. The system&#x27;s main effect on land was squally weather on the Windward Islands.
===Tropical Storm Chris===
Chris formed from a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 15. By August 21 convection in the northern part of the wave detached and organized into Tropical Depression Seven. The storm tracked westward along the southern periphery of a subtropical high pressure ridge over the mid-Atlantic. For the next seven days, surface and reconnaissance observations found little evidence that the storm was strengthening. As a result, it remained a tropical depression as it moved across portions of the Lesser and Greater Antilles as well as the Bahamas.

The depression passed south of Puerto Rico on August 24 and dumped more than of rain on parts of the island. Three deaths in Puerto Rico were attributed to the weather. On August 28 the storm was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris as it traveled northward just offshore of Florida. It made landfall near Savannah, Georgia, bringing light rain and wind damage to the area. Weakening to a depression, Chris poured heavy rains on South Carolina, where it merged with a cold front and became extratropical. The low accelerated over the Eastern Seaboard through Nova Scotia and finally dissipated on August 30. Heavy thunderstorms spawned a tornado in South Carolina that resulted in another death.
===Hurricane Debby===
Debby formed from the southern part of a tropical wave that became Tropical Storm Chris. In the mid-tropical Atlantic, the northern area of convection detached and became Tropical Depression Seven. The southern portion continued moving westward as a disorganized area of showers. The system did not develop until the low-level center emerged from the Yucatán into the Bay of Campeche on August 31. It is estimated that the storm became Tropical Depression Eight just offshore at around 12 p.m. local time.

Drifting west-northwest over the Gulf of Mexico, the depression organized and reached tropical storm-strength early on September 2. Later that day, based on observations from aircraft reconnaissance, Debby was upgraded to a hurricane. At peak intensity, the hurricane&#x27;s center was just from the coast. With little change in intensity, Debby made landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, six hours later. The storm brought high winds, inland flooding, and mudslides and caused 10 deaths.

Debby weakened considerably over the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains, although the remnants continued moving across Mexico. The tight center tracked towards the Pacific coast and reemerged near Manzanillo on September 5. Upon entering the Eastern Pacific, the system became Tropical Depression Seventeen-E before dissipating in the Gulf of California on September 8.
===Tropical Storm Ernesto===

On September 2 a cluster of thunderstorms associated with a northwestward-moving tropical wave developed a surface low near Bermuda. Though the surface low remained poorly defined and separate from the convection, the system became a tropical depression on September 3. Under the influence of southwesterlies, the depression accelerated northeastward at . Late on September 3 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ernesto. The storm continued to strengthen as it lost tropical characteristics. A large extratropical storm over the North Atlantic absorbed Ernesto on September 5. The only land area affected by the storm was in the Azores, where it brought near storm-force winds to Flores Island.
===Tropical Depression Ten===

A broad low-pressure area formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on September 2 and quickly developed through the next day. By September 3 convection was organized enough to declare the system a tropical depression about west-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana. Forecasters issued tropical storm warnings for the coast from Cameron, Louisiana, to Apalachicola, Florida, while the storm moved rapidly northeastward at 15 to . However, the depression degenerated a few hours later when it merged with the cold front that had caused its acceleration. Oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico reported winds gusts to , and moderate to heavy rains drenched large portions of southeast Texas and Louisiana. The wave dampened over the next 24 hours and brought heavy rain to the rest of the southeast, including a maximum of in Biloxi, Mississippi. No major damage was reported.
===Unnamed tropical storm===

A well-organized disturbance moved off the African coast on September 6 and rapidly developed into Tropical Depression Eleven. The NHC began issuing advisories on September 8 while it was northeast of Cape Verde. An after-the-fact review of satellite and ship reports indicated that the depression reached tropical storm-strength on September 7. However, because of its extreme eastern track, the storm&#x27;s observational track did not include this information.

For three days a large trough of low pressure northwest of the system steered it north-northwest towards cooler waters. Moderate to heavy rain was reported along the west coast of Africa, but no damage was reported. The system eventually weakened and merged with the low pressure trough. This unnamed storm was later added to the list of tropical storms in the annual summary for the Atlantic hurricane season.
===Hurricane Florence===
A cloud band accompanying a cold front exited the coast of Texas into the Gulf of Mexico on September 4. The band split into two over the central Gulf when the southern portion stalled and the northern portion developed into a frontal wave that tracked northeastward. Convection over the southern portion increased and wrapped around the center of the cloud band. On September 7 the system formed a surface circulation, and tropical depression advisories began that day.

The depression drifted eastward under the influence of the dissipating frontal trough and intensified into Tropical Storm Florence, as confirmed by hurricane hunters. The storm turned northward on September 9 and accelerated toward the northern Gulf Coast under the influence of a mid- to upper-level trough. Florence became a hurricane just hours before landfall on the western Mississippi Delta. The storm rapidly weakened over southeastern Louisiana and lost all its deep convection as it passed over the New Orleans area. Florence became a depression on September 10 near Baton Rouge and dissipated the next day over northeast Texas.

Early in its duration the system dropped moderate amounts of rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon striking Louisiana, storm surge water levels rose moderately above normal just east of where the center moved ashore. Gusty winds caused power outages to more than 100,000 people. In Alabama one man died while trying to secure his boat. Rainfall from the hurricane caused severe river flooding in portions of the Florida Panhandle in an area already severely affected by heavy rainfall, and the flooding damaged or destroyed dozens of houses in Santa Rosa County.
===Hurricane Gilbert===
The 13th tropical depression formed just east of the Lesser Antilles on September 8. As it moved west-northwest, it became Tropical Storm Gilbert over the islands on September 9. The tropical storm turned west and rapidly intensified to a major hurricane on September 11. Gilbert continued to strengthen as it brushed the southern coast of Hispaniola. It passed directly over Jamaica as a Category 3 hurricane and brought torrential rains to the island&#x27;s mountainous areas. When the center reemerged over water, Gilbert rapidly intensified again. On September 13 the central pressure dropped , the fastest deepening of an Atlantic hurricane on record until 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Wilma. Gilbert&#x27;s pressure of at the time was the lowest sea level pressure ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.

Gilbert weakened slightly before landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, although it struck at Category 5 strength. As the eye moved over land, the storm rapidly lost strength, reemerging on September 15 in the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. Hurricane Gilbert continued its northwest track and restrengthened to a minimal Category 4 hurricane. On September 16, Gilbert made its final landfall in northeast Mexico near the town of La Pesca with maximum sustained winds of . The center passed south of Monterrey, Mexico, on September 17 and brought heavy flooding to the city. Gilbert&#x27;s remnants turned north and eventually merged with a developing frontal low pressure system over Missouri.

Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic basin until Hurricane Wilma broke this record in 2005. The storm caused $2.98 billion in damage across the Caribbean and into Central America. Gilbert was the first hurricane to make landfall in Jamaica since Hurricane Charlie in 1951. Until 2007&#x27;s Hurricane Dean, it was also the most recent storm to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in Mexico. The death toll from Gilbert was reported to be 318 people, mostly from Mexico.
===Hurricane Helene===

A tropical wave with deeply organized convection crossed the coast of Africa on September 15. The system was forced west due to a strong ridge in the eastern Atlantic. On September 19 at 18:00 UTC, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Fourteen. By 06:00 UTC on September 20, the depression was strengthened, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Helene. Helene began to turn to the northwest on September 21 due to a major trough in the eastern Atlantic. Later on September 21, Helene intensified into a hurricane. Favorable conditions allowed the storm to continue strengthening, and on September 22, Helene became a major hurricane. Late on the following day, Helene attained its peak intensity; maximum sustained winds were at and the minimum pressure of .

After reaching peak intensity, Helene weakened as it tracked generally northward through the open Atlantic. By early on September 29, Helene briefly restrengthened into a Category 2 hurricane and reached a secondary peak of . However, later that day, Helene weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane while accelerating to the northeast. At 12:00 UTC on September 30, Helene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while centered well south of Iceland. The precursor tropical wave produced thunderstorms and gusty winds ranging between in Cape Verde on September 17.
===Tropical Depression Fifteen===

While Hurricane Helene was spinning in the central Atlantic, a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa in late September rapidly organized. On September 27 the storm became the fifteenth tropical depression of the season while it was about south-southeast of Cape Verde. The depression tracked westward at 15 to  but weakened rapidly. The next day it was downgraded to a tropical wave while still in the far eastern Atlantic, and never reformed in the Atlantic. Aside from a brief threat to the Cape Verde islands, the system remained far from any landmasses throughout its life.
===Tropical Storm Isaac===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 23. It traveled westward at a low latitude along the Intertropical Convergence Zone (or ITCZ), and its convection gradually grew more organized. On September 29 it was identified as Tropical Depression Sixteen about southeast of Barbados. The westward path of the storm shifted two degrees northward, possibly as a result of the formation of a new center. On September 30 the depression was upgraded when an Air Force reconnaissance plane discovered tropical storm-force winds. Westerly vertical wind shear prevented deep convection at the center of the storm. As Isaac approached the islands, northern parts of the Lesser Antilles were issued tropical storm warnings. Nevertheless, the storm lasted only a short time in the shearing environment. Isaac was downgraded to a depression on October 1 and completely dissipated shortly thereafter. The remnants of Isaac eventually regenerated in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin as Tropical Depression Twenty-E.

As a tropical cyclone, Isaac did not significantly affect land. However, the remnants dropped heavy rainfall across Trinidad and Tobago, causing flooding and mudslides that injured 20 people and left at least 30 homeless. Flash flooding in Morvant killed two people. Across the country, the storm damaged roads and bridges.
===Hurricane Joan===
On October 10, the 17th tropical depression of the season organized from a disturbance in the ITCZ. For the next two days the system traveled northwest while it strengthened into Tropical Storm Joan.
After passing through the southern Lesser Antilles, Joan traveled westward along the South American coast as a minimal tropical storm. It crossed the Guajira Peninsula on October 17 and quickly attained hurricane strength just from the coast. Hurricane Joan strengthened into a major hurricane on October 19 while drifting westward. The hurricane executed a tight cyclonic loop in which it weakened greatly but rapidly strengthened upon resuming its westward track. Joan reached its peak intensity just before making landfall near Bluefields, Nicaragua, on October 22 as a Category 4 hurricane. Joan at the time was the southernmost Category 4 hurricane ever recorded, but this record has since been broken by Hurricane Ivan. Joan remained well organized as it crossed Nicaragua and emerged in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin as Tropical Storm Miriam. Miriam gradually weakened until dissipating on November 2.

Hurricane Joan killed 148 people in Nicaragua and 68 others in affected nations. The hurricane damage in Nicaragua amounted to half of the $1.87 billion total. Joan also brought heavy rainfall and mudslides to countries along the extreme southern Caribbean. Its track along the northern coast of South America was very rare; Joan was one of only a few Atlantic tropical cyclones to move in this way. Joan was also the first tropical cyclone to cross from the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Greta of 1978.
===Tropical Depression Eighteen===

A westward-moving tropical wave, that left the coast of Africa in early October, tracked closely behind Hurricane Joan through the southern Caribbean. In an unusual occurrence the disturbance developed into the 18th tropical depression about behind the powerful hurricane. An Air Force reconnaissance check of tropical weather on October 19 spotted the depression near Colombia&#x27;s Guajira Peninsula. Hurricane Joan&#x27;s small size allowed the depression to remain out-of-reach as it developed. However, the outflow of the hurricane sheared the depression and sapped its energy. The system gradually dissipated on October 21 while Joan was experiencing rapid strengthening just before its arrival on the coast of Nicaragua. The depression brought heavy rain to the Netherlands Antilles. News reports blamed Tropical Depression Eighteen and other tropical systems for bringing swarms of pink locusts from Africa to Trinidad and other Caribbean nations.
===Tropical Storm Keith===
The last storm of the season formed from a tropical wave on November 17 to the south of Haiti. It moved westward through the Caribbean and became organized enough to attain tropical storm status on November 20. Keith rapidly organized and peaked with winds of before making landfall on the northeastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula on November 21. An upper-level trough forced it to the northeast, where upper-level shear and cooler drier air weakened it to minimal storm strength in a pattern typical for November. Keith restrengthened over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and struck near Sarasota, Florida, on November 23. After crossing the state, it became extratropical on November 24 near Bermuda and became an intense extratropical system over the Atlantic with sustained winds of minimal hurricane force.

Early in its duration Keith produced moderate to heavy rainfall in Honduras, Jamaica, and Cuba. Minimal damage was reported in Mexico, still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Gilbert two months earlier. Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, a rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage was widespread but fairly minor, totaling about $7.3 million. Damage near the coast occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion, while damage further inland was limited to flooding and downed trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1988. This is the same list used for the 1982 season. Storms were named &quot;Gilbert&quot;, &quot;Isaac&quot;, &quot;Joan&quot; and &quot;Keith&quot; for the first (and only in the cases of &quot;Gilbert&quot; and &quot;Joan&quot;) time in 1988. The names &quot;Florence&quot; and &quot;Helene&quot; had been previously used under the old naming convention.

===Retirement===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Gilbert&quot; and &quot;Joan&quot; from the rotating Atlantic hurricane name lists after the 1988 season on account of their severity. They were replaced with &quot;Gordon&quot; and &quot;Joyce&quot; for the 1994 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration (within the basin), peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1988 USD.

<text>Dietlinde &quot;Lilli&quot; Gruber (born 19 April 1957) is an Italian journalist and former politician.

Currently a talk show host for Italian private television channel La7, Gruber also served as Member of the European Parliament from 2004 to September 2008 with the Olive Tree centre-left coalition.

==Biography==

===Early career and resignation from RAI===

Gruber was born in Bolzano and is a German and Italian native speaker. She attended the foreign languages and literature course at the University of Venice. In 1982 Gruber started her journalism career and in 1987 became the anchor of TG1, the main television news program on Rai Uno.

In 1988, she became political correspondent for RAI, covering events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the war in the former Yugoslavia, the situation in the United States after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and the Iraqi war.

In 1999, in addition to her TV career in Italy, she also worked with the German TV broadcasters such as SWF (1988) and Pro 7 (1996).

In April 2004, Gruber resigned from her position at RAI in protest against the influence on state controlled media by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. She attacked his &quot;unresolved conflict of interest&quot;, and considered that RAI had abandoned its tradition of pluralism in order to support the government&#x27;s views. Gruber has also worked for the Italian newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot;, for &quot;Io Donna&quot;, &quot;TV Sorrisi e Canzoni&quot; and &quot;Anna&quot;.

===Member of European Parliament===
In the European Parliament elections of 2004 she ran as an independent candidate for the European Parliament under the centre-left Olive Tree ticket; her candidacy was proposed, together with Michele Santoro, after she was pushed out of Silvio Berlusconi-controlled RAI. She topped the Olive Tree votes in two electoral regions, and beat Berlusconi himself in the Central region vote. After election, she joined the Socialist Group. Gruber served in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and as an alternate on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Chair of the Delegation for relations with the Gulf States, including Yemen. She resigned from her position in September 2008, months before the natural completion of her mandate, to return to her previous journalism career.

===Back into national TV===
After her resignation from European Parliament, in 2008 Gruber accepted an offer from private TV channel La7, where she took charge of the long-running political talk show &quot;Otto e mezzo&quot; (it).

===Bilderberg invitation===
She was included in the guest list of Bilderberg Group 2012 edition, at Chantilly, Virginia, as Journalist/Anchorwoman, and was the only journalist allowed at the 2013 meeting in Hertfordshire, England.

<text>Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939), is a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court which clarified that when proposing for the ratification of an amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to Article V thereof, if the Congress of the United States chooses &quot;not&quot; to set a deadline by which the proposed amendment must be acted upon by the requisite three-fourths of state legislatures or state ratifying conventions, then the proposed amendment remains pending business before the state legislatures (or ratifying conventions). The case centered on the Child Labor Amendment, which was proposed for ratification by Congress in 1924.

== Background ==
The practice of limiting the time available to the states to ratify proposed amendments began in 1917 with the Eighteenth Amendment. All amendments proposed since then, with the exception of the Nineteenth Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment, have included a deadline, either in the body of the proposed amendment, or in the joint resolution transmitting it to the states. In its decision the Court concluded that Congress was quite aware in 1924 that—had it desired to do so—it could have imposed a deadline upon the Child Labor Amendment and Congress simply chose not to.

== Decision ==
According to &quot;Coleman&quot;, it is none other than the Congress itself—if and when the Congress should later be presented with valid ratifications from the required number of states—which has the discretion to arbitrate the question of whether too much time has elapsed between Congress&#x27; initial proposal of that amendment and the most recent state ratification thereof assuming that, as a consequence of that most recent ratification, the legislatures of (or conventions conducted within) at least three-fourths of the states have ratified that amendment at one time or another.

The &quot;Coleman&quot; ruling—which modified the high Court&#x27;s earlier 1921 dictum in &quot;Dillon v. Gloss&quot;—held that the question of timeliness of ratification is a political and non-justiciable one, leaving the issue to the discretion of Congress. Thus it would appear that the length of time elapsing between proposal and ratification is irrelevant to the validity of the amendment. Based upon the Court&#x27;s reasoning in &quot;Coleman&quot;, the Archivist of the United States proclaimed the Twenty-seventh Amendment as having been ratified when it surpassed the &quot;three fourths of the several states&quot; threshold for becoming a part of the Constitution. Declared ratified on May 7, 1992, it had been submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789, an unprecedented time period of .

== Impact ==
The &quot;Coleman&quot; decision has been described as reinforcing the political question doctrine which is sometimes espoused by Federal courts in cases wherein the court deems the matter at hand to be properly assigned to the discretion of the legislative branch of the Federal government. In light of the precedent established by this case, three proposed constitutional amendments, in addition to the Child Labor Amendment, are considered to be still pending before the state legislatures (the Congressional Apportionment Amendment since 1789; the Titles of Nobility Amendment since 1810; and the Corwin Amendment since 1861), as Congress did not specify a ratification deadline when proposing them to the states.

<doc id="802711" wikidata="Q3499502" url="?curid=802711" title="Stimmung">
<text>Stimmung, for six vocalists and six microphones, is a piece by Karlheinz Stockhausen, written in 1968 and commissioned by the City of Cologne for the Collegium Vocale Köln. Its average length is seventy-four minutes, and it bears the work number 24 in the composer&#x27;s catalog.

It is a tonal and yet also a serial composition. It is &quot;the first major Western composition to be based entirely on the production of vocal harmonics&quot;, the first &quot;to use overtones as a &quot;primary&quot; element&quot;. An additional innovation is &quot;the unique kind of rhythmic polyphony which arises from the gradual transformation/assimilation of rhythmic models&quot;.

==Title==
The German word &quot;Stimmung&quot; has several meanings, including &quot;tuning&quot; and &quot;mood&quot;. The word is the noun formed from the verb &quot;stimmen&quot;, which means &quot;to harmonize, to be correct&quot;, and related to &quot;Stimme&quot; (voice). The primary sense of the title &quot;implies not only the outward tuning of voices or instruments, but also the inward tuning of one&#x27;s soul&quot;. According to the composer, the word 

==Overview==
&quot;Stimmung&quot; is in just intonation. Six singers amplified by six microphones tune to a low B1 drone, inaudible to the audience, and expand upwards through overtone singing, with that low B&#x27;s harmonics 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 (B2, F2, B3, D4, A4, and C5) becoming in turn fundamentals for overtone singing. It is composed using what the composer calls moment form, and consists of 51 sections (called &quot;moments&quot;).

The harmonies of &quot;Stimmung&quot; are composed from 108 pitches: twelve different tones for each of the three women&#x27;s voices, and twenty-four for each of the three men. Not only do the performers produce partials from the overtone series in each note they sing, but all of the fundamental tones are also related by whole-number overtone ratios. In this way, overtones are composed upon overtones, generating a range of degrees of harmonic fusion.

According to the 1986 Hyperion Singcircle liner notes:
The order of the rhythmic models and the distribution of the poems and &quot;magic names&quot; are decided by the performers, but the sequence of pitches in the 51 moments is fixed. Though the 1968 &quot;Paris version&quot; used by the Collegium Vocale Köln at the world première has been published (as No. 24½ in Stockhausen&#x27;s catalog), the 1977 &quot;Singcircle version&quot; (directed by Gregory Rose) has been well documented in , and both versions have been performed throughout the world. Singcircle performances include the Round House on 21 November 1977, a 1977 BBC Promenade Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, in Liverpool&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral as part of the 1980 Hope Street Festival, and at the Barbican in 1985, with the composer at the mixing desk. Singcircle&#x27;s performance at the 2005 City of London Festival was recorded and broadcast on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Hear and Now&quot; on 20 August 2005. In 2003, Paul Hillier made a &quot;Copenhagen version&quot; for the Theatre of Voices, which he directed. This version, too, has been performed on tour, and a recording has been released on CD. Other groups that have performed &quot;Stimmung&quot; include the London Sinfonietta Voices, Ensemble Belcanto, Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart, the Aquarius Consort, and the Dunedin Consort, according to the performance database of Universal Edition.

==Influences and reception==
Stockhausen himself attributes a month spent walking among ruins in Mexico as his primary influence, &quot;Stimmung&quot; recreating that &#x27;magic&#x27; space. On the other hand, he also describes the snow on frozen Long Island Sound in February and March 1968 (when he was composing &quot;Stimmung&quot; in Madison, Connecticut), as &quot;the only landscape I really saw during the composition of the piece&quot;. In a letter to Gregory Rose written on 24 July 1982 (printed in the liner notes to Hyperion CDA66115), he describes how, in the small house his wife Mary had rented it was only possible for him to work at night because their two small children needed quiet during the day. He could not sing aloud, as he had done initially, but began to hum quietly, listening to the overtone melodies. Mary reports that Stockhausen first discovered the technique when listening to their small son Simon producing multiple tones while humming in his crib after falling asleep. In this way, Stockhausen became &quot;the first Western composer to use this technique of singing again—in the Middle Ages it had been practised by women and children in churches, but was later entirely supplanted by masculine Gregorian music&quot;.

Some writers have seen the possible influence of Stockhausen&#x27;s student La Monte Young and his mid-1960s drone music with The Theatre of Eternal Music:
However, another precedent for &quot;Stimmung&quot; is an unfinished work by Stockhausen himself, begun in 1960 and titled &quot;Monophonie&quot;, which was to have consisted of the single note E. Igor Stravinsky, on the other hand, traces &quot;Stimmung&quot;″s one-note idea back to the pedal point in Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy upon One Note&quot;, and its time-scale to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, while at the same time observing that this time-scale &quot;indicates the need of a musical equivalent to the parking meter&quot;.

&quot;Stimmung&quot; had an enormous impact on many younger composers and has been cited as an important influence on the French spectralists of the 1970s, such as Tristan Murail and Gérard Grisey.

<doc id="802722" wikidata="Q55928" url="?curid=802722" title="Waldemar Pawlak">
<text>Waldemar Pawlak (born 5 September 1959) is a Polish politician. He has twice served as Prime Minister of Poland, briefly in 1992 and again from 1993 to 1995. From November 2007 to November 2012 he served as Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Economy. Pawlak remains Poland&#x27;s youngest prime minister to date.

He is also a long-time commander of the Polish Volunteer fire department, holding the rank of Brigadier General. Since 2015 Pawlak is workstream leader for the AMU (Agency for the Modernisation of Ukraine), where he contributes his expertise in economy.

==Early life, education and early political career==
Pawlak was born in the village of Model, Masovian Voivodeship on 5 September 1959. He is a graduate of the Warsaw University of Technology, completing his education with an engineering degree. While he was a student, he actively participated in student strikes against Poland&#x27;s martial law policy from 1981-83. Following his graduation, he briefly ran a small 17-hectacre farm in eastern Poland. This move would help popularize him with Polish farmers during his later political career.

In 1984, Pawlak became a computer teacher in Kamionka (near Pacyna). His political career began in 1985, when he joined the United People&#x27;s Party. After 1990, like many UPP members, he joined the UPP&#x27;s successor, the Polish People&#x27;s Party. He was elected from UPP office to the Contract Sejm (1989) and has remained a member of Sejm since then. He became leader (&quot;Prezes&quot;) of the UPP in 1991.

==Premiership of Waldemar Pawlak==
===First Premiership===
On 5 June 1992, 00:00 AM, after a vote of no confidence was approved, with 273 in favour and 119 against, Jan Olszewski was forced to resign as prime minister and his cabinet was immediately replaced in an event known as &quot;the nightshift&quot; (&quot;Nocna zmiana&quot;). After Olszewski&#x27;s dismissal, President Lech Wałęsa designated the little-known and inexperienced Pawlak as caretaker prime minister with the mission, to form a new coalition government with agrarians, Christian democrats and liberals. Pawlak&#x27;s potential partners, the Democratic Union and the Confederation of Independent Poland were not ready to agree on a compromise programme. The fact was that Pawlak and nobody else was called upon to form a new government that was nevertheless a remarkable phenomenon. According to Aleksander Kwaśniewski, it was a &#x27;historical step&#x27; towards a &#x27;normalization&#x27; of Polish political and party life.

After 33 days as a caretaker, Pawlak failed to gain support from the Sejm majority and failed in a vote of confidence. Pawlak was forced to resign as prime minister and the President replaced him with Hanna Suchocka, who won support from the majority and successfully formed a coalition with the Democratic Union, Christian National Union, Liberal Democratic Congress, Peasants&#x27; Agreement, People&#x27;s Christian Party, Party of Christian Democrats and Polish Beer-Lovers&#x27; Party. Pawlak&#x27;s failure paved the way for another political coalition.

Since Pawlak&#x27;s first cabinet did not receive support from the Sejm, at this time, Pawlak had no official ministers, only temporary chiefs of executive branches. His first cabinet was the briefest government during this period that lasted only 33 days, this was a notable period commonly known as &quot;Pawlak&#x27;s 33 days&quot; (&quot;33 dni Pawlaka&quot;). Although Pawlak failed to form a government, he gained considerable respect from his 33 days in office, and the experiences gained from this short stint in office helped him win his second premiership in 1993.

===Second Premiership===
The Polish People&#x27;s Party and the social democratic, post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) won the 1993 election in a landslide, holding a super-majority and the support of the socialist-agrarian government, with Pawlak as prime minister again. Although Pawlaks cabinet included Józef Oleksy of the SLD as Sejm Marshal, influential SLD leader Aleksander Kwaśniewski remained a Sejm Member without any special appointments.

Following this slight, Prime Minister Pawlak and Kwaśniewski soon found themselves at bitter political odds. Kwaśniewski reportedly had an ambition to become &quot;Prime Minister de facto&quot;, while Pawlak wanted to retain the power of his office. Both leaders used their parties to fight for power.

Pawlak was initially in an informal alliance with President Wałęsa against the SLD. However, their good political relations soon dissipated.

In 1995, Pawlak offered three options to Kwaśniewski. First, he would remain prime minister but with Kwaśniewski as Deputy and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Second, the Democratic Left Alliance would form a government with Kwaśniewski as prime minister. Third, Oleksy would become prime minister under the present coalition. Pawlak reportedly thought that Kwaśniewski would not risk a minority Democratic Left Alliance government without the support of the majority of the elevation of his main partisan opponent, Oleksy, to prime minister and therefore rather be the deputy of Pawlak. However, Kwaśniewski surprised many by choosing the third option.

Pawlak was known for his reticence and aversion to journalists. The opposition and the media accused him of a lack of dynamism and a terrible information policy. Pawlak gave up the prime ministerial Volvo 780 limousine in favour of a FSO Polonez Caro, equipped with a Rover V8 engine to show solidarity with the automotive industry in Poland. This gesture was well-received by Poles at a time when the country was suffering poverty.

In terms of policy, Pawlak pushed for many leftist reforms while in office, striving for improved workers rights and corporate accountability. Despite this socialist platform, Pawlak did very little to slow the trend of privatization that swept through Poland in the 1990s. In many ways, Pawlak was seen as an agrarian that represented the Polish farmer first and foremost.

==In the political wilderness==

Despite good public approval ratings Pawlak failed in his bid for the Presidency in 1995, finishing a distant fifth (after Kwaśniewski, Wałęsa, Jacek Kuroń and Jan Olszewski) and winning only 770,417 votes (4.31%).

After losing the political battle with Kwaśniewski and, after that, the presidential election, there was a movement to replace Pawlak with Jarosław Kalinowski as party leader in 1997.

The PSL suffered a great political disaster during the 1997 parliamentary elections and became the smallest party in the Sejm (from 132 seats in 1993 to just 27).

After the SLD won decisively in the 2001 parliamentary election Kalinowski became deputy of the new Prime Minister Leszek Miller when the PSL joined the coalition. Pawlak did not play a major role during this period.

==2005 political comeback==
Pawlak became leader of the SLD in 2005 after a period of internal turmoil caused by a steady decline the party&#x27;s popularity. Following this political victory, Pawlak became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy in the liberal Civic Platform (PO)-PSL government, formed after the 2007 parliamentary election, under Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Although PSL remained the smallest party represented in the Sejm, Pawlak is often cited as having achieved a major political victory. During his time in the party chair his party enjoyed better electoral results, the elimination of major competition among agrarian voters from the also agrarian dominated party (Samoobrona), and the resumption of major influence in rural areas. Additionally, PSL was put in charge of three cabinet posts in the Tusk government. (Without the PSL votes, the PO would not have a Sejm majority, even though it easily accounts for the biggest political group in the sitting parliament.)

On 21 April 2010, PSL announced that Pawlak would be the party&#x27;s official candidate for the 2010 presidential election. He received only 1.75% of the vote and didn&#x27;t get into the second round.

In 2023 he was elected to the Senate, the upper house of the Polish parliament.

==Personal life==
Pawlak is married and has 2 children.

<doc id="802732" wikidata="Q1122254" url="?curid=802732" title="Golgo 13">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Takao Saito, published in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Big Comic&quot; since October 1968. The series follows the title character, a professional assassin for hire. &quot;Golgo 13&quot; is the oldest manga still in publication, and its edition was certified by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the highest number of volumes for a manga series. Before his death in 2021, Saito said that he wanted the manga to continue on without him; he had previously raised concerns that the manga may be unfinished after he passes away. The Saito Production group of manga creators will continue its publication with the assistance of the &quot;Big Comic&quot;″s editorial department.

The series has been adapted into two live-action feature films, an anime film, an original video animation, an anime television series and six video games.

With a cumulative total of 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is one of the best-selling manga series. The manga won the 1975 Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga and the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.

==Story==
Golgo 13 is a professional assassin. His real name, age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity. Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. His most frequently used alias is , but he also goes by and .

Duke Togo has a very quiet personality and will only talk when he needs to, he shows very little to no emotion when carrying out an assassination and is willing to kill anyone who will threaten to expose him. He accepts many different assassination jobs, from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having the FBI, the CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.

The name &quot;Golgo 13&quot; is a reference to the death of Jesus Christ. &quot;Golgo&quot; is short for Golgotha, the place of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, while the number 13 is considered an unlucky number. Also, Golgo 13&#x27;s logo is a skeleton wearing a crown of thorns.

Duke Togo&#x27;s past is a mystery. Although his Asian appearance suggests that he may be of Japanese origin, many of Golgo 13&#x27;s stories have presented different speculations about his true identity while presenting contradictory information, leaving readers uncertain which information is true. It is known that he may be the biological father of many different children all over the world from the many sexual encounters he has had with women throughout the series, such as a four-year-old son named Joey from ex-Provisional Irish Republican Army fighter Catherine McCall.

With respect to the character&#x27;s age, a large number of stories are dated as they are centered around current events of the time. However, Golgo 13 himself has not aged significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.

==Production==
Early on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters&#x27; faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology. Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning. Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for &quot;Golgo 13&quot;, three of which he later novelized. Takashi Nagasaki was Saito&#x27;s editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name &quot;Keishi Edogawa&quot;.

According to Jason Thompson, several &quot;Golgo 13&quot; stories have not been reprinted for being &quot;offensive or libelous&quot;. Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about money laundering in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has AIDS.

In 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even included the panel layout. He said he had no idea when &quot;Golgo 13&quot; would end, claiming &quot;The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.&quot; Two years later, &quot;Big Comic&quot;″s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was &quot;heading towards its conclusion.&quot;

Due to difficulties that arose from the restrictions implemented by the government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; began its first hiatus in its 52-year history in May 2020. It returned on July 7, 2020.

Saito died of pancreatic cancer at 84 on September 24, 2021. According to Shogakukan, Saito said before his death that he wanted the manga to continue on without him. The Saito Production group of manga creators continues its publication with the assistance of &quot;Big Comic&quot;″s editorial department.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Takao Saito, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; has been serialized in the monthly manga magazine &quot;Big Comic&quot; since its January 1969 issue, published in October 1968. The chapters have been collected into volumes by Shogakukan and Leed Publishing, a spinoff of the author&#x27;s own Saito Production, since June 21, 1973. As of December 2024, 215 volumes of the edition have been published, while the edition has 173 volumes.

In 1986, Leed Publishing released four &quot;Golgo 13&quot; stories translated by Patrick Connolly: &quot;Into the Wolves&#x27; Lair&quot;, &quot;Galinpero&quot;, &quot;The Ice Lake Hit&quot; and &quot;The Ivory Connection&quot;.

In 1989 and 1990, Leed and Vic Tokai published two further &quot;Golgo 13&quot; comic books, &quot;The Impossible Hit&quot; and &quot;The Border Hopper&quot;, as part of the promotion for two &quot;Golgo 13&quot; video games. The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.

In 1991, Leed Publishing and Viz Media published &quot;The Professional: Golgo 13&quot;, a three-part mini-series. &quot;The Professional&quot; was a re-printing of &quot;The Argentine Tiger&quot;, a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina Juan Perón.

In 2006, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; was brought back by Viz as part of their Viz Signature collection. The stories are picked from the forty-year history of the manga, and do not necessarily represent the original&#x27;s order of publication. A total of thirteen volumes were published, with the thirteenth volume being published on February 19, 2008. Each volume ends with an editorial commentary on &quot;Golgo 13&quot; as a cultural phenomenon in Japan.

====Spin-offs====
A spin-off manga titled and focusing on the character Dave McCartney began serialization in the August special issue of &quot;Big Comic&quot; on July 17, 2021. The spin-off ended its &quot;first season&quot; on May 17, 2022, and resumed on February 17, 2024. Saito and Saito Production are credited with creating the manga. Its first volume was released on September 30, 2022. As of January 30, 2025, two volumes have been released.

A second spin-off, created by Yukio Miyama, was launched on Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;MangaONE&quot; app on August 28, 2021. It is a gag comedy and follows Golgo 13 at a modern-day campsite.

A third spin-off, , was serialized for eight chapters in &quot;Big Comic Zōkan&quot; from July 15, 2022, to November 17, 2023. It focuses on the French junior high school student Fanette, who has Golgo&#x27;s genes. Its chapters were collected in two volumes, released on May 30, 2023, and February 29, 2024.

===Live action===

Toei Company produced a live-action film simply titled &quot;Golgo 13&quot; in 1973, directed by Junya Sato and starring Ken Takakura as Duke Togo and Pouri Banayi as Catherine Morton. It was filmed entirely in the Imperial State of Iran with an entirely Persian supporting cast. It was followed by &quot;Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon&quot; in 1977, directed by Yukio Noda, which replaced Takakura with Sonny Chiba. In 2011, production company Davis Film obtained the American film rights to &quot;Golgo&quot;.

Selected episodes were broadcast on BS-TBS, under the title &quot;Golgo 13 Selection&quot;, on December 10–17, 2023.

&quot;Golgo 13: The Professional&quot;, known simply as &quot;Golgo 13&quot; in Japan, is a 1983 animated featured film. Golgo 13&#x27;s voice is provided by Tetsurō Sagawa in the Japanese version, and Gregory Snegoff in Streamline Pictures&#x27; English dub. It incorporates CGI animation, which was in its infancy at the time. This is most notable in the scene where army helicopters circle around Dawson Tower and attack Golgo as he climbs toward Dawson&#x27;s office on the top floor.

====&quot;Golgo 13: Queen Bee&quot;====

===Video games===
Several video games based on &quot;Golgo 13&quot; have been released: 

*The first &quot;Golgo 13&quot; video game was released for the Sega SG-1000 in 1984, followed by &quot;Golgo 13: Oi no Su&quot; for the MSX in 1985.
*Two games were released by Vic Tokai on the Nintendo Entertainment System: &quot;Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Mafat Conspiracy&quot; (1990). Both are the only &quot;Golgo 13&quot; games to receive official English releases, with the license intact. 
*Two digital manga were released only in Japan for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1998; the digital manga features English text option, in addition to Japanese.
*Namco and Eighting/Raizing developed three lightgun arcade games, similar to the &quot;Silent Scope&quot; series, but with a few differences. The rifle only contained a magnifying lens, not a small monitor like &quot;Silent Scope&quot;. The screen itself would close up on the target only when the sensor on the underside of the rifle base was activated by the player leaning their shoulder into it. Each mission was preceded by an eight- to ten-panel manga briefing. The first two releases, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Golgo 13: Kiseki no Dandou&quot; (&quot;Golgo 13: Miraculous Trajectory&quot;) in 2000, ran on Namco System 12 hardware, with the third, &quot;Golgo 13: Juusei no Chinkonka&quot; (&quot;Golgo 13: Requiem of a Gunshot&quot;) in 2001, on Namco System 10 hardware.
*The most recent &quot;Golgo 13&quot; game, &quot;Golgo 13: File G-13&quot;, was released for the Nintendo DS on June 18, 2009, by Marvelous Entertainment. The game consists of a large quiz mode, featuring questions spanning the forty-year history of &quot;Golgo 13&quot;, as well as several mini-games, including the &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Behind Me&quot; game, in which the player, as Golgo 13, must punch people who walk up behind him (a reference to the tagline shown at the end of each episode of the 2008 anime, &quot;Do not stand behind him, if you value your life.&quot;) The game is played holding the DS on its side, also known as &quot;book style&quot;.

There was also an LCD game based on &quot;Golgo 13&quot; released only in Japan by Popy in 1982, as well as several pachinko and pachislot machines released in Japan between 2001 and 2017, one of which receiving a simulator port for the PlayStation in 2002.

A version of Golgo 13&#x27;s signature weapon, the scoped M16, was released in the Japanese version of &quot;Alliance of Valiant Arms&quot; as a usable weapon.

===Other media===
In addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including NEC and Lotte Black Black. There was also a radio drama featuring Masane Tsukayama as Golgo 13.

An Airsoft gun has been made by Tokyo Marui based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses. A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.

==Reception==
&quot;Golgo 13&quot; won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005. With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; was certified as holding the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for &quot;Most volumes published for a single manga series.&quot; On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; ranked 36th. &quot;Golgo 13&quot; is one of the works credited with popularizing the movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series&#x27; popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; &quot;It evokes [the martial art of drawing one&#x27;s sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. I love Japanese samurai stories and that is why, unconsciously, Golgo moves like a samurai. That is why I thought foreigners wouldn&#x27;t understand the story.&quot;

By March 2021, &quot;Golgo 13&quot; had over 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling manga series in history.

Anime News Network&#x27;s Carl Kimlinger compared Saito&#x27;s work on the series to the novels of John le Carré and Frederick Forsyth, as the stories are &quot;dark, meticulously constructed [and] painstakingly realistic&quot;. Leo Lewis of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Unsmiling, misogynist and inexorable, [the character] is a literary cousin of James Bond without the scene-softeners of Moneypenny, M, Q or exploding fountain pens.&quot; The &quot;Daily Vanguard&quot; called Duke &quot;a badass, something like a cross between Dirty Harry and &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;″s Solid Snake.&quot; JC DuBois of Dragon&#x27;s Anime has criticized those who say that most of Golgo 13&#x27;s hits are impossible to do since there are problems that would prevent him from shooting straight such as the wind or with the coriolis effect, saying that the &quot;whole mystique of &quot;Golgo 13&quot; is that he&#x27;s just that damn good. He CAN make those shots—and he can do it with one shot.&quot;

<doc id="802738" wikidata="Q718045" url="?curid=802738" title="Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro">
<text>Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro (Hebrew: איליה פיאטצקי-שפירו; ; 30 March 1929 – 21 February 2009) was a Soviet-born Israeli mathematician. During a career that spanned 60 years he made major contributions to applied science as well as pure mathematics. In his last forty years his research focused on pure mathematics; in particular, analytic number theory, group representations and algebraic geometry. His main contribution and impact was in the area of automorphic forms and L-functions.

For the last 30 years of his life he suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, with the help of his wife Edith, he was able to continue to work and do mathematics at the highest level, even when he was barely able to walk and speak.

==Moscow years: 1929–1959==
Piatetski-Shapiro was born in 1929 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Both his father, Iosif Grigor&#x27;evich, and mother, Sofia Arkadievna, were from traditional Jewish families, which had become assimilated. His father was from Berdichev, a small city in Ukraine, with a largely Jewish population. His mother was from Gomel, a similar small city in Belarus. Both parents&#x27; families were middle-class, but they sank into poverty after the October revolution of 1917. He became interested in mathematics at the age of 10, struck, as he wrote in his short memoir, &quot;by the charm and unusual beauty of negative numbers&quot;, which his father, a PhD in chemical engineering, showed him.

In 1952, Piatetski-Shapiro won the Moscow Mathematical Society Prize for a Young Mathematician for work done while still an undergraduate at Moscow University. His winning paper contained a solution to the problem of the French analyst Raphaël Salem on sets of uniqueness of trigonometric series. The award was especially remarkable because of the atmosphere of strong anti-Semitism in Soviet Union at that time.

Despite the award, and a very strong recommendation by his mentor Alexander O. Gelfond, a professor of mathematics at Moscow University and an important Communist Party member (Gelfond’s father was a friend of Lenin), Piatetski-Shapiro’s application to graduate program at Moscow University was rejected. He was ultimately admitted to the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, where he received his Ph.D. in 1954 under the direction of Alexander Buchstab. His early work was in classical analytic number theory. This includes his paper on what is now known as the &quot;Piatetski-Shapiro prime number theorem&quot;, which states that, for 1 ≤ &quot;c&quot; ≤ 12/11, the number of integers 1 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; for which the integer part of &quot;nc&quot; is prime is asymptotically &quot;x&quot; / &quot;c&quot; log &quot;x&quot; as &quot;x&quot; → ∞.

After leaving the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, he spent a year at the Steklov Institute, where he received the advanced Doctor of Sciences degree, also in 1954, under the direction of Igor Shafarevich. His contact with Shafarevich, who was a professor at the Steklov Institute, broadened Piatetski-Shapiro&#x27;s mathematical outlook and directed his attention to modern number theory and algebraic geometry. This led, after a while, to the joint paper in which they proved a Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces.

==Moscow years: 1960s==
Piatetski-Shapiro in 1958 was made a professor of mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Applied Mathematics, where he introduced Siegel domains. By the 1960s, he was recognized as a star mathematician. In 1965 he was appointed to an additional professorship at Moscow State University. He conducted seminars for advanced students, among them Grigory Margulis (now at Yale) and David Kazhdan (now at Hebrew University). He was invited to attend 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm, but was not allowed to go by Soviet authorities (Shafarevich, also invited, presented his talk). In 1966, Piatetski-Shapiro was again invited to the ICM in Moscow where he presented a 1-hour lecture on Automorphic Functions and arithmetic groups (Автоморфные функции и арифметические группы).

Piatetski-Shapiro was not allowed to travel abroad to attend meetings or visit colleagues except for one short trip to Hungary. The Soviet authorities insisted on one condition: become a party member, and then you can travel anywhere you want. Ilya gave his famous answer: “The membership in the Communist Party will distract me from my work.”

During the span of his career Piatetski-Shapiro was influenced greatly by Israel Gelfand. The aim of their collaboration was to introduce novel representation theory into classical modular forms and number theory. Together with Graev, they wrote the book &quot;Automorphic Forms and Representations&quot;.

==Refusenik period and emigration to Israel==
During the early 1970s, a growing number of Soviet Jews were permitted to emigrate to Israel. The anti-Jewish behavior in the Soviet Union, however, was not enough to make Piatetski-Shapiro want to leave his country. What shook him to the core was the difficulty of maintaining a Jewish identity and the enforced conformity to communism around him in the scientific community. He didn’t wish this future for his son, sixteen at the time.

Piatetski-Shapiro lost his part-time position at mathematics department of Moscow State University in 1973, after he signed a letter asking Soviet authorities to release a dissident mathematician Alexander Esenin-Volpin from a mental institution. Many other mathematicians who signed the letter (including Shafarevich) also lost their part-time positions.

After his ex-wife and son left the Soviet Union in 1974, Piatetski-Shapiro also applied for an exit visa to Israel and was refused. After applying for emigration in 1974, he lost his research position at the Moscow Institute of Applied Mathematics (IPM). The authorities refused to grant him an exit visa, claiming that he was too valuable a scientist to be allowed to leave. As a refusenik, he lost access to mathematical libraries and other academic resources. He continued his researches nevertheless, and colleagues took books from the library for him.

As a prominent refusenik with connections to an international scientific community, Piatetski-Shapiro was followed around by a KGB car and his apartment was under electronic surveillance. He conducted his meetings with friends and colleagues by writing on a plastic board, especially when he needed to communicate about his situation. His plight as a mathematician, with serious restrictions on his researches and without means for survival, attracted much attention in the U.S. and Europe. In 1976, a presentation was made to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences urging the use of their good offices to get Piatetski-Shapiro an exit visa. Later that year, he obtained one. His second marriage ended as his then-current wife remained in Moscow. He visited colleagues all over the world who had signed petitions and fought for his freedom before going to Israel. He was welcomed warmly upon arrival in Israel and accepted a professorship at Tel Aviv University. He was elected into Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1978.

After leaving Soviet Union, Piatetski-Shapiro also visited the USA in 1976 and spent a semester as a visiting professor at University of Maryland.

==Yale and converse theorem==
Starting in 1977, Piatetski-Shapiro divided his time between Tel Aviv University and Yale University, directing doctoral dissertations in both places. One of his major works at Yale dealt with the converse theorem which establishes a link between automorphic forms on &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix groups and zeta functions.

For &quot;n&quot; = 1 this theorem is classical. The assertion for &quot;n&quot; = 2 was proved by André Weil, and the novel version for &quot;n&quot; = 3 was conceived by Piatetski-Shapiro while he was still a refusenik in the Soviet Union. It took another 25 years and works with other collaborators, in particular his student James Cogdell, before a full result for the general case was completed.

The converse theorem has played a role in many of the results known in the direction of the principle of functoriality of Langlands.

==Last years==
Piatetski-Shapiro battled Parkinson&#x27;s disease for the last 30 years of his life. His condition worsened in the last 10 years to the point where he was barely able to move and speak, but thanks to the support of his wife Edith, he was still able to travel to mathematical conferences. With the help of James Cogdell he was able to continue research until almost his last days.

He was married three times and had a son, Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro and daughters, Vera Lipkin and Shelly Shapiro Baldwin.

==Awards and honours==
Piatetski-Shapiro was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1978, was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1992–1993, and was the recipient of numerous prizes, including:
* In 1981, the Israel Prize, for mathematics; and
* In 1990, the Wolf Prize for Mathematics.
* In 2020, the Jerusalem Post listed Piatetski-Shapiro as one of the Russian-speaking Jews who shaped Israel. It notes that along with colleague James Cogdell, Piatetski-Shapiro developed the Converse Theorem, which finds some deep relationships between different fields of mathematics.

He was invited to address the quadrennial International Mathematical Congress — one of the highest mathematical honors — 4 times: 1962, 1966 (gave plenary address), 1978 (presented 45 minute talk), and 2002.

<doc id="802763" wikidata="Q719156" url="?curid=802763" title="Mike Ilitch">
<text>Michael Ilitch Sr. (July 20, 1929 – February 10, 2017), also known as Mr. I, was an American entrepreneur and restaurateur who served as the founder and owner of the international fast food franchise Little Caesars Pizza. He also owned the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League and Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.

Ilitch was at the center of Detroit&#x27;s downtown redevelopment efforts; he purchased and renovated the Fox Theatre and relocated his business headquarters (Ilitch Holdings) there. He also owned Olympia Entertainment. A second generation American of Macedonian descent, he was married to Marian Bayoff Ilitch.

==Early life==
Ilitch was born in Detroit in 1929 to Macedonian immigrants Sotir and Sultana Ilitch. His father was a tool-and-die maker.

==Business career==
A graduate of Cooley High School in Detroit, Michigan, Ilitch served in the U.S. Marine Corps for four years.

After his return home to Detroit, the Detroit Tigers offered him $3,000 if he would sign to play baseball, and Ilitch had a four-year minor league career from 1952 to 1955. Ilitch played mostly second base for the Tigers&#x27;, New York Yankees&#x27;, and Washington Senators&#x27; organizations in the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League, Cotton States League, and Florida International League. He was forced out of his playing career due to a knee injury.

After leaving baseball, Ilitch started a pizza business in 1959. With the help of his wife, Marian, the Ilitches opened Little Caesars Pizza Treat in Garden City, Michigan. , the family&#x27;s entities remain privately held. In 1999, the Ilitches established Ilitch Holdings, Inc. to provide their various enterprises with professional and technical services, and held the titles of chairman and vice chairwoman, respectively. The combined total revenues for these enterprises in 2007 reportedly exceeded $1.8 billion. Ilitch had fallen off &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the &quot;400 Richest Americans&quot;, but in 2006 he returned to the list at No. 242. As of December 2016, he was No. 86 on the Forbes 400 and had an estimated net worth of $6.1 billion.

In 2000, Ilitch and his wife appointed two of their children as co-presidents of Ilitch Holdings, Inc.: Christopher Ilitch and daughter Denise Ilitch, an attorney. Christopher Ilitch was named to the new post of CEO and president. Denise Ilitch later left the company &quot;to pursue other opportunities&quot;.

== Sports ownership ==

=== Detroit Wheels ===
In an era of experimentation in sports leagues, the Detroit Wheels were a football team that played in the World Football League for the 1974 season. Ilitch was part of a 33-person consortium (including Motown singer Marvin Gaye) that funded the ill-fated WFL team which would not even last the inaugural season in the start-up league.

=== Detroit Caesars ===
The Detroit Caesars were a professional softball team that began play in the American Professional Slow Pitch Softball League (APSPL) in 1977. The team disbanded after the 1979 season. 

Prior to formalized professional play, a major sponsor of amateur softball in the Detroit area was Little Caesars, who sponsored the 1970 American Softball Association national championship team. With the formation of a professional league, Ilitch formed a team in his first solo step into professional sports ownership.

The Caesars played at Memorial Field in East Detroit and featured former Detroit Tiger stars Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley, Jim Price and Norm Cash, along with established softball players such as Mike Nye, Ronnie Ford, Mike Gouin, Bert Smith, and Tex Collins. The team was led by manager Gary Vitto, earning the team two championships before disbanding after the 1979 season. Vitto would go on to serve as General Manager of the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League and then served in the front office of the Detroit Tigers, both owned by Ilitch.

=== Detroit Red Wings ===
In 1982, Ilitch bought the Detroit Red Wings from Bruce Norris (whose family had owned the team for 50 years) for US$8 million, and turned the team into a perennial contender for the Stanley Cup. After years of drafting top picks and grooming their young players, and with proper management and leadership, the Red Wings became an elite NHL team. They made the Stanley Cup finals three times between the 1994–1995 and 1997–1998 seasons, winning the Cup in 1997 (fifteen years after Ilitch purchased the Red Wings) and again in 1998. The Red Wings added two more championships in 2002 and 2008. Prior to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked the Red Wings as the fifth-most valuable franchise in the NHL, despite a $16 million operating loss.

For the 2007–2008 hockey season, the team won the President&#x27;s Trophy for the best record in the NHL for the sixth time—the most of any NHL team since the President&#x27;s Trophy was introduced in 1985–1986. The Red Wings made the playoffs for 25 consecutive seasons through 2015–2016. The 25 consecutive playoff berths were the longest active streak of post-season appearances in all of the North American professional sports, before ending in the 2016–2017 season. It is tied for third all-time in NHL history after 29 consecutive appearances by the Boston Bruins from 1967–1968 to 1995–1996, 28 consecutive trips by the Chicago Blackhawks from 1969–1970 through 1996–1997, and is tied with the 25 consecutive appearances by the St. Louis Blues from 1979–1980 to 2003–2004.

=== Detroit Tigers ===
Ilitch purchased the Detroit Tigers in 1992 from fellow pizza magnate Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino&#x27;s Pizza. Under his ownership, the Tigers logged losing records in twelve out of thirteen seasons before their turnaround in 2006.

After acquiring the team, Ilitch expressed interest in moving the struggling team to a new ballpark. In 2000, his expectations were realized when the team moved from Tiger Stadium into the newly built Comerica Park. He financed approximately 60% of the $350 million facility; the taxpayers of the greater Detroit-Wayne County and federal grants covered the balance. Various Ilitch Holdings, Inc. enterprises manage and operate Comerica Park and its concessions.

In 2005, the Detroit Tigers hosted MLB&#x27;s 76th All-Star Game at Comerica Park.

When the Tigers won the AL Wild Card under manager Jim Leyland and general manager Dave Dombrowski in 2006, they made the playoffs for the first time since 1987. They also reached the World Series for the first time since 1984, but the Tigers eventually lost in five games to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Series. After Dombrowski was brought in, Ilitch steadily agreed to bring in marquee free agents and finance a larger payroll, with the Tigers beginning the 2008 season as one of the highest-salaried teams in baseball.

On September 16, 2011, the Tigers won the Central division title—their first division crown since Ilitch&#x27;s purchase. On January 24, 2012, Ilitch signed Prince Fielder to a nine-year, $214 million contract, the fourth-largest contract in baseball history. The 2012 Tigers went all the way to the World Series, but were swept by the San Francisco Giants. Prior to the 2013 season, Ilitch agreed to sign starting pitcher Justin Verlander to a seven-year, $180 million contract extension, at the time the highest single offer ever tendered to a major league pitcher. The Tigers won four consecutive AL Central Division titles between 2011 and 2014, but Ilitch&#x27;s quest for a World Series title was not achieved before his death in 2017.

=== Detroit Drive ===
Ilitch was one of the early team owners in the Arena Football League, starting up the Detroit Drive in 1988. The Drive were one of the most successful teams in the early days of the AFL, both on and off the field. They generally had strong attendance (although much of that was due to discounted or giveaway tickets), and the Drive were in the ArenaBowl in every year of their six-year existence, going 4–2 in the title games.

After Ilitch bought the Tigers in 1992 though, he decided he didn&#x27;t want to own another franchise that would take away fans from the Tigers, so he sold the team and they moved to Worcester, Massachusetts.

=== Hockey Hall of Fame ===
Ilitch was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003 as well as the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Philanthropy==

One of Ilitch&#x27;s first philanthropic efforts was the Little Caesars Love Kitchen, established in 1985. The traveling restaurant was formed to feed the hungry and assist with food provisions during natural disasters. The program has been recognized by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, and has served more than 2 million individuals in the United States and Canada.
In 2006, inspired by a veteran returning to civilian life after losing both of his legs in the war, Ilitch founded the Little Caesars Veterans Program to provide honorably discharged veterans with a business opportunity when they transition from service or seek a career change. Ilitch received the Secretary&#x27;s Award from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for this program in 2007; it is the highest honor given to a civilian by the department.
The Little Caesars Amateur Hockey Program, established by Ilitch in 1968, helped thousands of children. Additionally, Ilitch Charities for Children was founded in 2000 as a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving the lives of children in the areas of health, education, and recreation.

In 2008, the charity was renamed Ilitch Charities and its focus was broadened. The new charity invests in the community&#x27;s future by supporting innovative, collaborative and measurable programs that promote economic development and spur job growth, as a means to address social issues such as poverty, unemployment, homelessness, and hunger.

As a result of his philanthropy, the School of Business for Wayne State University in Detroit is named the &quot;Mike Ilitch School of Business&quot;.

According to OpenSecrets, reports required by the Federal Election Commission from 2002 to 2005 indicate Ilitch Holdings, Inc. members and business partners have contributed more than $500,000 to political campaigns and PACs.

After civil rights icon Rosa Parks was attacked in her Detroit apartment in 1994, Ilitch quietly paid years of Parks&#x27;s rent to enable her to live in a safer part of Detroit.

==Personal life==
Ilitch was married to Marian Ilitch (née Bayoff, born 1933), who would go on to become one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest women. Like Ilitch, his wife was born in Michigan to immigrants from Macedonia. Together, they had seven children: Denise Ilitch Lites (born 1955), an attorney; Ron Ilitch (1957 – 2018), who died of a fentanyl poisoning at the age of 61; Michael Ilitch, Jr., a film producer whose credits include &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Angriest Man in Brooklyn&quot; (2014); Christopher Ilitch (born 1965), the current CEO of Ilitch Holdings; Lisa Ilitch Murray, who served as the executive vice president of the Detroit Red Wings; Atanas Ilitch, an actor and singer whose most notable credit was that of the Driller Killer in &quot;Slumber Party Massacre II&quot; (1987); and Carole Ilitch Trepeck, also an attorney.

The family was presented the key to the City of Detroit by Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick in February 2008, and were the fifth recipients of this award.

==Death==
Ilitch died on February 10, 2017, at the age of 87 in Detroit, Michigan. The Red Wings wore a patch on their right shoulders in his memory, which featured his nickname “Mr. I” in a rectangle, for the remainder of the season; in addition, the nickname was featured on the ice at Joe Louis Arena, being painted on the center section of the rink, facing the Red Wings&#x27; bench.
The Detroit Tigers also wore a black patch with his nickname &quot;Mr. I&#x27; in a circle on the right sleeve of their home and away jerseys. In the aftermath of this death, his son, Christopher, took control of Ilitch Holdings and its properties.

<text>Bonnie Gail Franklin (January 6, 1944 – March 1, 2013) was an American actress. She is best known for her leading role as Ann Romano in the television series &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; (1975–1984). She was nominated for Emmy, Tony, and Golden Globe Awards.

==Early life==
Franklin was born January 6, 1944, in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of Claire (née Hersch) and Samuel Benjamin Franklin, an investment banker who founded the Beverly Hills, California chapter of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Her parents were both Jewish immigrants; her father from Russia and her mother from Romania; they married in Montreal before moving to the US.

Her family moved to Beverly Hills when she was 13 years old. She graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1961. She attended Smith College in Massachusetts, performing in an Amherst College production of &quot;Good News&quot; as a freshman, but she returned to California, enrolling at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and earning her bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1966.

==Career==

Franklin first appeared on television at age 9 in &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;. and in 1954 played the role of Martha Cratchit in the Shower of Stars television show version of “A Christmas Carol”. At age 11, she appeared in a non-credited role in the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956). She and Tuesday Weld are the two giggling girls in the doorway of an apartment.

In the 1960s, she portrayed a teenage feature character in &quot;You&#x27;re the Judge,&quot; a short educational film about baking sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble and featuring the use of Crisco. She debuted on Broadway in 1970 in the musical &quot;Applause&quot;, earning a Tony Award nomination. Her recording of &quot;Applause&quot;, the show&#x27;s title track, was the most successful Broadway song of the season, vocally upstaging the star of the show, Lauren Bacall. Although she was on stage for only a fraction of the running time of that show, Franklin attracted a lot of attention. In its July 1970 edition, for example, &quot;Vogue&quot; published a photo spread in which the magazine predicted big careers for three young women: Melba Moore, Sandy Duncan, and Franklin.

Franklin appeared at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey in both &quot;George M!&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;. From June 22 through September 2, 1973, she appeared as Carrie Pipperidge in a production of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; at the Jones Beach Theater on Long Island in New York in a cast that included John Cullum and Barbara Meister.

She guest-starred on several television series, including &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (&quot;The Gazebo in the Maze Affair&quot; from 1965) and &quot;Hazel&quot; (&quot;Hazel Sits It Out&quot; from 1965). She had a semi-regular role in the ABC series &quot;Gidget&quot;. She directed several episodes of the 1980s sitcom &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; and the syndicated comedy series &quot;The Munsters Today&quot;.

Franklin was best known for her portrayal of divorced mother Ann Romano on the television situation comedy &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; (1975–1984). In April 2011, Franklin and other cast members from &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; accepted the &quot;Innovators Award&quot; from the TV Land cable channel—one of several awards in the annual event. The citation on the TV Land web site reads: 
A Democrat, she supported Walter Mondale&#x27;s campaign in the 1984 presidential election.

In 1988, Franklin appeared at the Bucks County Playhouse and at the Pocono Playhouse, both in Pennsylvania, in the title role of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. Also in 1988, she appeared with Tony Musante at the Westside Arts Theatre (in Manhattan) in &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; by Terrence McNally. She later performed in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Pittsburgh Public Theater (July 1998). In 1997, she appeared at Ford&#x27;s Theatre, Washington, D.C., in &quot;All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&quot; (September 1999). In 2005, she appeared with Bruce Weitz at the New Theatre Restaurant in Overland Park, Kansas in &quot;2 Across&quot; (August–September 2011). She played &quot;Ouiser&quot; in a production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; at the Rubicon Theater, Ventura, California (October 4–14, 2011).

In the mid and late 2000s, Franklin appeared in nearly a dozen staged readings in the Greater Los Angeles area with Classic and Contemporary American Playwrights (CCAP), which she founded in 2001 with her sister Judy. During the 2006–2007 season, she appeared in the drama &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, written by Lillian Hellman. She appeared in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Bound&quot; at the Pico Playhouse in January 2008.

In 2005, she was reunited with her &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; co-stars Mackenzie Phillips, Valerie Bertinelli and Pat Harrington for the 60-minute CBS TV special retrospective &quot;The One Day at a Time Reunion&quot;. In 2011, she was reunited once again with Bertinelli on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, playing the mother of Bertinelli&#x27;s character&#x27;s boyfriend.

On April 28, 2012, she was among several stars who appeared at the 28th annual Southland Theatre Artists Goodwill Event (STAGE) benefit, titled &quot;Original Cast 3&quot;, at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles. The event raised more than $200,000 for APLA&#x27;s work with clients living with HIV and AIDS in Los Angeles County. Franklin and other original-cast members from a variety of musicals performed songs with which they are associated. Franklin sang the title song from &quot;Applause&quot;, which she had originally introduced on Broadway in 1970.

Franklin appeared in several episodes of the daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. The episodes were broadcast in August 2012, and only a month later she was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. The actress was cast as a nun, Sister Celeste, who came to the assistance of Victor Newman when he had amnesia while working at a shipping port in Los Angeles. In addition to her work in the theater and on television, Franklin performed in cabaret at various venues, including Le Mouches, Grand Finale, The Eighty-Eights, Triad, and The Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel—all in New York City—and at Odette&#x27;s in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

She was scheduled to appear in Joan Didion&#x27;s one-woman play &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; at the Ensemble Theatre Company of Santa Barbara in April 2013, but withdrew because of illness.

==Personal life==
Franklin was married twice, first to playwright Ronald Sossi from 1967 to 1970, and then to film producer Marvin Minoff for 29 years, from 1980 until his death on November 11, 2009. Minoff had been the executive producer of a television movie, &quot;Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger&quot;, which starred Franklin as Margaret Sanger, before the couple married in 1980. She had two stepchildren, Jed and Julie Minoff.

==Illness and death==
On September 24, 2012, a family spokesman announced that Franklin had pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment. On March 1, 2013, at age 69, Franklin died at her home in the Los Angeles area.

<text>A National Scenic Byway is a road recognized by the United States Department of Transportation for one or more of six &quot;intrinsic qualities&quot;: archeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational, and scenic. The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation&#x27;s scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote tourism and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

Some scenic byways are designated All-American Roads, which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of January 21, 2021, there are 184 National Scenic Byways located in 48 states (all except Hawaii and Texas).

==History==
The NSBP was established under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which provided $74.3 million in discretionary grants. On May 18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Peña announced the first 14 National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June 9, 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) provided $148 million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.

On August 10, 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175 million to states and Indian tribes. On October 16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood designated 37 new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads. The U.S. Department of Transportation approved the designation on January 19, 2021, of 34 new roads as National Scenic Byways, in addition to 15 new All-American Roads.

==Requirements==
National Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).

===Intrinsic qualities===
For designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.

*Scenic quality is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.
*Natural quality applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, fossils, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.
*Historic quality encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.
*Cultural quality is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or vernacular architecture.
*Archeological quality involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor&#x27;s archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.
*Recreational quality involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor&#x27;s landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.

===Corridor management plans===
A corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan &quot;should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway&#x27;s intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development&quot;. The plan includes, but is not limited to:

*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.
*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.
*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.
*A general review of the road&#x27;s or highway&#x27;s safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.
*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.
*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.

Corridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:

*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.
*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway&#x27;s designation as an All-American Road.
*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.

The final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the United States Secretary of Transportation.

<text>The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) is a major, multi-campus medical school located throughout the U.S. state of Indiana and is both the undergraduate and graduate medical school of Indiana University. There are nine campuses throughout the state; the principal research, educational, and medical center is located on the campus of Indiana University Indianapolis. With 1,461 MD students, 195 PhD students, and 1,442 residents and fellows in the 2023–24 academic year, IUSM is the largest medical school in the United States. The school offers many joint degree programs including an MD/PhD Medical Scientist Training Program. It has partnerships with Purdue University&#x27;s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, other Indiana University system schools, and various in-state external institutions. It is the medical school with the largest number of graduates licensed in the United States per a 2018 Federation of State Medical Boards survey with 11,828 licensed physicians.

The school has pioneered research in multiple specialties, including oncology, immunology, substance use, neuroscience, and endocrinology. Research discoveries include a curative therapy for testicular cancer, the development of echocardiography, the identification of several genes linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and the creation of inner ear sensory cells from pluripotent stem cells.

In the 2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings of the best graduate schools for medicine, the school ranked 23rd in the nation for primary care and 41st for research out of 192 medical schools. In the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings of the best hospitals, the Indiana University Health Medical Center had seventeen nationally ranked clinical programs. The Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health is nationally ranked in 9 of 10 designated specialties for children in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report.&quot; The IU School of Medicine is also home to the Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. In federal fiscal year 2023, IUSM ranked 29th for National Institutes of Health funding among all US medical schools (13th among all &quot;public&quot; US medical schools) with $243,608,100 of funding.

It was the only medical school in the state from when the Valparaiso University School of Medicine closed in 1917 to when the Tom and Julie Wood College of Osteopathic Medicine at Marian University opened in 2010. IUSM remains the state&#x27;s only allopathic, MD degree-granting school.

==History==
Indiana University (IU) established a department of medicine at Bloomington in 1903, but the school in Indianapolis traces its founding to 1908, following the resolution of a rivalry with Purdue University over which institution had the legal authority to establish a medical school in Marion County. A year after the IU- and Purdue-affiliated schools in Indianapolis were consolidated in 1908, the Indiana General Assembly authorized IU to operate a medical school in Marion County.

===Founding in Bloomington===
In March 1903, William Lowe Bryan, the tenth president of IU, proposed the formation of a department of medicine at IU Bloomington to the university trustees. The new department was approved and established in May of the same year. The IU School of Medicine was admitted as a member of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 1904.
In addition to IUSM in Bloomington, IU&#x27;s leaders wanted to locate medical training facilities in Indianapolis. Their initial plan was to provide medical students with the first two years of coursework at Bloomington and the final two years at Indianapolis, where students would receive clinically based training as part of their studies. Prior to 1908, due primarily to the high cost of establishing its own medical facilities in Indianapolis, IU attempted to merge with existing medical schools, but the effort was unsuccessful.

=== Earlier schools ===
The current school in Indianapolis is a chaotic mixture of many earlier medical colleges. The 19th and early 20th centuries saw many short-lived medical schools established in Indiana, mostly in Indianapolis, with the majority lasting less than a decade. This is mostly attributable to financial reasons and because most of medical education at this time was taught through an apprenticeship system and through private, for-profit schools. University-based schools with access to state funding and endowments became the standard model for medical education later on in the 1890s, with Johns Hopkins University leading the way. 

The first Indiana school was established in 1833 as the Christian College at New Albany. It was largely regarded as a fraudulent diploma mill, and offered courses, but not degrees, in medicine. It closed the same year. The first public medical school, Vincennes University&#x27;s department of medicine, was short lived as well, only lasting 1837–1838. Many other schools of varying quality and regard would open and close throughout the next 70 years.

The first successful school was the private LaPorte University School of Medicine (LPSM) founded in 1841. The first proprietary school was the Indiana Central Medical College (ICMC) founded in Indianapolis in 1849; it served as the medical department of Indiana Asbury University, today known as DePauw University. John Stough Bobbs, a pioneer local physician, served as the ICMC&#x27;s dean. LPSM was renamed to the Indiana Medical College in 1846 and would ultimately merge into the ICMC in 1851; the ICMC would itself close in 1852. 

In 1869, another school, also named the Indiana Medical College (IMC), was launched by Bobbs and colleagues as an outgrowth of the Indianapolis Academy of Medicine. Initial classes were held in the Old Indiana Statehouse; as the building was actively falling apart around this time, classes were soon moved to a building at the northwest corner of Delaware and Court streets. Clinical classes were taught at the Indianapolis City Hospital and various other hospitals and clinics around the city. The IMC would associate with IU in 1871; though the partnership ended in 1876 when IU failed to receive state funding for medical instruction. The Doctor of Medicine program at the IMC was not particularly rigorous, and one could graduate after only five months of study. However, graduates still required years of apprenticeship post-graduation, equivalent to a modern-day medical residency.

Samuel A. Elbert, the first African American to receive a medical degree in Indiana, graduated from the IMC in 1871 following a dispute with the college. 

In 1874, the College of Physicians and Surgeons opened in Indianapolis as a breakaway school from the Indiana Medical College following a dispute over admissions policies; the schools reunited as the Medical College of Indiana (MCI) and associated with Butler University in 1878. The MCI&#x27;s building was located at the northeast corner of South Pennsylvania and East Maryland streets; it was destroyed by a fire in 1894. Following a bequest by physician William Lomax (a graduate of LPSM), a new medical education building named in Lomax&#x27;s honor was constructed in 1895 at 212 North Senate Ave. It was razed in 1960 for the construction of the Indiana Government Center North, surviving both extensive water damage in 1916 and fire damage in 1919. 

Two more medical schools opened in 1879: the Indianapolis-based Central College of Physicians and Surgeons (CCPS) and the Fort Wayne College of Medicine (FWCM). The CCPS was founded by dissidents from the MCI unhappy with the association with Butler, and moved into a building at 214 North Senate Avenue, just up the road from the MCI. The FWCM briefly associated with Taylor University from 1890 to 1893.

In 1896, the MCI, Butler, and the Indiana Law School formed a loose collection of colleges named the University of Indianapolis (U of I), not related to the modern university of the same name. The Indiana Dental College joined U of I in 1904. Plans existed to create a central campus and expand the number of component colleges but they never materialized, and thus U of I remained an amorphous entity. Its component colleges gradually joined with IU over time with the exception of Butler, which remains independent to this day.

After IUSM was founded in 1903, formal negotiations opened between IU and the MCI for the MCI to leave U of I and join with IU; however, due to fundamental disagreements on where the resulting school of medicine would be located (the MCI wished it to remain in Indianapolis while IU wanted to move it to Bloomington), the proposal was not ratified, and by 1904 the matter was indefinitely abandoned.

=== Rivalry with Purdue University ===
While negotiations were ongoing between IU and the Medical College of Indiana, representatives from the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons approached Purdue University&#x27;s medical department in West Lafayette, which had been established sometime prior to 1895, to arrange a similar union. The Purdue trustees declined the offer, not wanting to interfere with the concurrent negotiations between IU and the MCI. In May 1905, the MCI submitted the same proposal (&quot;...to give its property and assets of an appraised value of $100,000 to the University, and to accompany the gift by its good will and the gratuitous services of its faculty; the motive being to permanently establish a medical college of high order in connection with an educational institution of good standing.&quot;) that had failed ratification with IU to Purdue&#x27;s trustees. The trustees took the proposal into consideration, and were &quot;convinced that the conditions were unusually favorable to the consummation of a union of interests where all previous efforts had failed, and to the inauguration of a progressive educational movement of great value to the State&quot;. By September the proposal was accepted subject to the approval of the state legislature, and the MCI became part of Purdue University with the full title of &quot;the Indiana Medical College, the School of Medicine of Purdue University&quot;.
On September 25, 1905, the trustees of the CCPS voted to suspend operations and to transfer the students, alumni, personal property, and funds of the college to the Purdue School of Medicine. Later on October 2, the Fort Wayne College of Medicine voted to likewise merge with the Purdue School of Medicine and transfer personnel and equipment to Indianapolis. The Purdue School of Medicine operated out of the former MCI&#x27;s facilities (the Lomax Building) at 212 North Senate Avenue in Indianapolis (the northwest corner of Market Street), in the immediate vicinity of the Indiana Statehouse. The building that housed the CCPS was sold. In May 1906, 122 students received medical degrees from Purdue University and successfully passed the examination of the State Board of Medical Registration. In the spring of 1907, Purdue graduated 68 men and four women; in that class was Arett C. Arnett, a physician who helped establish a Lafayette clinic in 1922 later known as Arnett Clinic and today known as Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital.

In 1906, the faculty of the Purdue School of Medicine published a resolution in the Indiana Medical Journal and the daily press stating that all graduates of the Medical College of Indiana, the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Fort Wayne College of Medicine were entitled to the degree of Doctor of Medicine and such diploma from Purdue University; that graduates of the former schools could receive these items upon application to Purdue; and the alumni records of the three former schools would thereafter be kept as the records of the Indiana Medical College, the School of Medicine of Purdue University. Immediately thereafter on April 3, 1906, alumni of the former CCPS passed a resolution rejecting the Indiana Medical College as their alma mater, and expressed support that &quot;the only logical place for a State Medical Department&quot; was with Indiana University. 

The founding of the Purdue-controlled consolidated medical school in 1905 triggered a debate over which state university, IU or Purdue, had the legal authority to establish a state-supported, four-year medical school in Indianapolis. IU believed that under the legislative act that elevated Indiana College to a university on February 15, 1838, it had the sole authorization to provide state-supported instruction in medicine; but, the development of a medical school had been delayed due to a lack of sufficient funding. A legal opinion published by a W. H. H. Miller on October 31, 1905, stated that the university did not have clear authority to conduct a medical program outside Monroe County, as that legislative act only mentioned medical education &quot;on the grounds of the university&quot;. The rivalry was so intense that it is sometimes labeled as the instigating factor for the cancellation of athletic events between the universities from 1906 to 1908; however, newspapers from the time cite a fight that occurred at a baseball game in West Lafayette on May 31, 1906, as the cause.

The building that was sold and had housed the former CCPS would eventually come under the ownership of IU supporters, who would establish a separate medical school, the State College of Physicians and Surgeons (SCPS), there in 1906. Clinical faculty were recruited from those unhappy with the arrangement with Purdue. This school offered clinical instructions to IU Bloomington&#x27;s third- and fourth-year medical students. The SCPS enrolled 109 students in September 1906. In August 1907, the IU board of trustees agreed to a merger of the IU School of Medicine in Bloomington with the SCPS in Indianapolis but agreed to take financial responsibility only for the school&#x27;s facilities in Monroe County. The first two years of training continued at Bloomington and the final two years of clinical training were held at the SCPS in Indianapolis, with a Doctor of Medicine degree conferred by Indiana University.

=== Incorporation of Purdue&#x27;s school and move to Indianapolis ===

To resolve their ongoing dispute, the leaders of IU and Purdue, along with each of their supporters, sought approval from the Indiana General Assembly to operate their own schools of medicine in Marion County, with the 1907 legislative session hearing proposals from both IU and Purdue to operate separate schools. Divided over competing loyalties to IU or Purdue (the state&#x27;s largest public schools and historic rivals), legislators debated for months, with neither bill being passed. Eventually, Purdue&#x27;s president, Winthrop E. Stone, relented and was hailed as a peacemaker, stating that Purdue should leave medical education to IU since it was not central to Purdue&#x27;s mission as an agricultural and mechanical university and because the problem was so disruptive. In April 1908, IU and Purdue reached an agreement that incorporated the SCPS and the Purdue School of Medicine into the school of medicine in Bloomington and retained the name Indiana University School of Medicine. The agreement additionally stipulated that the school be governed by a board of directors consisting of representatives from IU, Purdue, and the Indiana State Medical Association. This shared governance came to an end on February 26, 1909, when the state legislature formally authorized IU to operate a medical school in Marion County and clearly mandated that IU assume total responsibility for the state&#x27;s public medical school. The state legislature&#x27;s authorization enabled IU&#x27;s medical students to complete years two through four of their medical education in Indianapolis or remain in Bloomington for their first two years before transferring. Students still had to complete at least one year in Bloomington.

Following Indiana University&#x27;s near-total consolidation of medical education in the state, only two proprietary schools remained, both of which would close in the following years (the Eclectic Medical College of Indiana, 1900–1908; and the Physiomedical College of Indiana, 1873–1909, which was held in high regard among contemporaries at the time). The final independent medical institution was the Valparaiso University School of Medicine (VUSM), founded in 1902 after VU&#x27;s purchase of the Chicago-based American College of Medicine and Surgery, itself founded in 1901 as the Chicago Eclectic Medical College. Renamed as the Chicago College of Medicine &amp; Surgery (CCM&amp;S) in 1907, the CCM&amp;S functioned as VUSM&#x27;s physical facilities, clinical sites, and laboratories. In a similar arrangement to IUSM&#x27;s Bloomington and Indianapolis campuses, VUSM allowed students to complete their preclinical studies in Valparaiso before transferring to the CCM&amp;S in Chicago. After VU declared bankruptcy in 1917, the CCM&amp;S was sold to Loyola University Chicago and would go on to become the Stritch School of Medicine. Thus, IUSM was left as the last school remaining after a tumultuous century of competition for medical education in Indiana. 

===Early leadership and enrollment===
Dr. Allison Maxwell, who headed one of the former proprietary schools, agreed to serve as the first dean of the four-year IU School of Medicine in Indianapolis in April 1908; he remained as its dean until 1911. Maxwell led the fledgling school through a difficult time when financial budgets were an issue and the consolidation of IU&#x27;s and Purdue&#x27;s medical school faculties in Indianapolis and Bloomington was completed. The combined faculty would support the four-year medical school at Indianapolis and maintain the two-year, pre-clinical coursework at Bloomington. This arragement continued until 1911, when only the first year of preclinical coursework would be taught in Bloomington. In addition to Maxwell, other leaders in IUSM&#x27;s early history were drawn from Johns Hopkins University, including Charles P. Emerson, who was appointed as the second dean of IUSM in 1911 and served in that role until 1931.

Willis Dew Gatch became the third dean of the medical school in 1932. In 1909, Gatch invented the Gatch adjustable hospital bed, which used a crank to raise and lower the patient&#x27;s head and feet. John D. VanNuys, a 1936 graduate of IUSM, became its fourth dean in 1947. Amelia R. Keller, department of pediatrics, was the sole woman on the clinical faculty of the IU Medical School in Indianapolis after the school&#x27;s consolidation with the Purdue School of Medicine in 1908.

IUSM graduated its first class of twenty-seven students and conferred its first Doctor of Medicine degree in May 1907. The first graduation of the consolidated IU and Purdue schools of medicine took place the following year. IUSM&#x27;s first black student, Clarence Lucas, graduated in 1908; the first woman graduate of the newly consolidated school, Lillian Mueller, did so in 1909.

===The Flexner Report===
Abraham Flexner, a renowned American educator whose work helped reform many medical schools, visited IUSM in November 1909. He noted in his later Flexner Report (1910): &quot;The situation in the state [was], thanks to the intelligent attitude of the university, distinctly hopeful, though it will take time to work it fully.&quot;

Flexner also made a recommendation for the progress of the school: &quot;In order to make the school attractive to highly qualified students, it will be necessary (1) to employ full-time men in the work of the first two years, (2) to strengthen the laboratory equipment, (3) greatly improve the organization and conduct of the clinical courses.&quot; The IU School of Medicine was one of few medical schools in the nation at the time to receive a positive evaluation from Flexner, primarily because of its strong emphasis on college preparatory coursework in the sciences prior to enrolling in medical school and its additional training in the basic sciences as part of its medical school curriculum.

===Early and current facilities===
In its early years in Indianapolis, IUSM utilized the SCPS facilities (themselves the former CCPS facilities), erected in 1902 and located at the corner of Market Street and Senate Avenue. After the consolidation of IUSM with the SCPS and the Purdue School of Medicine in 1908, the medical school used the former Purdue School of Medicine facilities (which were the former MCI&#x27;s facilities) for about ten years while it secured financing to construct new medical school buildings. Several of the medical school&#x27;s early buildings in Indianapolis were erected in the 1910s and 1920s on property that would eventually become the site of the IU Medical Center on the present-day IU Indianapolis campus.

In February 1912, IU acquired property on West Michigan Street, near the Indianapolis City Hospital (the modern-day Sidney &amp; Lois Eskenazi Hospital), to erect the Robert W. Long Hospital. Construction on the new teaching hospital began in 1912. Although its cornerstone was laid on November 1, 1912, the Great Flood of 1913 delayed the building&#x27;s opening until 1914. Long Hospital was dedicated on June 15, 1914, and admitted its first patients the following day. Also planned with the opening of Long Hospital was the creation of the IU Training School for Nurses. Originally a part of IUSM, it became its own school (the IU School of Nursing) in 1956. Emerson Hall, another early medical school building, was constructed about northeast of Long Hospital and completed in the fall of 1919 at a cost of $257,699. Long Hospital was considered for demolition in the 1950s and was ultimately replaced by University Hospital in 1970; the building remains in service to IU Health and IUSM as Long Hall. 

The cornerstone of the Riley Hospital for Children was laid on October 7, 1923, and dedicated on October 7, 1924. The hospital, named in honor of Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, was erected north of Long Hospital. The James Whitcomb Riley Association (now known as the Riley Children&#x27;s Foundation) hoped to raise an initial $250,000 in funding to add to the state&#x27;s appropriation. By 1923 it had received $911,518 in pledges from more than 30,000 citizens, including $45,000 in donations from a mass fundraising event. Significant additions to the hospital were built over the years, including three in the 1930s: a Kiwanis Unit, dedicated in 1930; a Rotary Unit, dedicated in 1931; and a hydrotherapy pool in 1935.

Another of the medical school&#x27;s early teaching hospitals was the William H. Coleman Hospital for Women. Erected west of Long Hospital and dedicated on October 20, 1927, Coleman Hospital&#x27;s total cost was about $300,000. Other early buildings erected on the medical school campus in Indianapolis included the Ball Residence for Nurses, dedicated on October 7, 1928; and Fesler Hall, built in 1939. Long Hospital received the addition of Willis D. Gatch Hall in 1938. Myers Hall was built in Bloomington in 1937 for the medical students there. The school&#x27;s medical research building was expanded in 1947 with a five-year grant from the Riley Children&#x27;s Foundation. The Van Nuys Medical Science Building opened in Indianapolis in 1958. The nearby Ruth Lilly Medical Library building opened in 1989. 

=== Expansion ===

Following the opening of Van Nuys, all medical instruction was moved to Indianapolis. Due to a projected shortage of American physicians in the early 1960s, some state politicians called for a second medical school. Rather than face competition, IU proposed the creation of a statewide medical school system under its control. IUSM ceased its consolidatory efforts in Indianapolis and instead looked for partners throughout the state to expand medical education; the first two years of medical education resumed at Bloomington as well. In 1968, IUSM found its first partners: the University of Notre Dame in South Bend and its old rival, Purdue in West Lafayette. Pilot programs were established at each campus, and about a dozen students at both Notre Dame and Purdue were allowed to complete the first two years at their regional campuses before transferring to Indianapolis. In 1971, the state legislature accepted IU&#x27;s proposal and established a statewide system for medical education, and five other first-year training sites were added throughout the state by 1981 at IU Northwest in Gary, Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne, Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana State University in Terre Haute, and at a joint venture of the University of Evansville and the Evansville campus of Indiana State. By 1990 all regional campuses were able to provide the first two years of education before transfer to Indianapolis (prior to this only Bloomington, South Bend, and West Lafayette provided the first two years). Faced with another call for more physicians in the early 2000s, all campuses offered full four-year programs by 2014, allowing students to complete their degrees at a regional campus without transfer to Indianapolis.

In 2009, IUSM and IU Health opened Fairbanks Hall along the Indiana Central Canal, a six-story office and clinical studies building. Nearby is IU Health&#x27;s Goodman Hall neuroscience center, which opened in 2012, that houses IUSM&#x27;s Stark Neurosciences Research Institute. 

On October 19, 2022, IUSM broke ground to create a new, $230 million medical education and research building in Indianapolis expected to open November 2024. It will be connected via a skybridge to IU Health&#x27;s new $4.3 billion flagship facility, a consolidation of University and Methodist hospitals, that itself is planned to open in 2027. 

==Curriculum==
In 2003, it was one of ten medical schools nationwide chosen by the American Medical Association to develop new methods of teaching professionalism to doctors. To ensure that its educational process more accurately reflected its commitment to graduating caring and competent physicians, the Indiana University School of Medicine initiated a competency curriculum in 1999. To support the values expressed in the competency-based curriculum, the IU School of Medicine simultaneously implemented a school-wide &quot;relationship-centered care initiative&quot; to address its informal curriculum.

In 2016, IUSM implemented a new curriculum to prepare students to meet the challenges of a complex, ever-evolving healthcare environment. The new curriculum prepares students to practice medicine in a team-based interdisciplinary setting. It also allows students who decide to permanently leave the MD program to apply for the Master of Science in Medical Science degree, provided they have completed all requirements of Phase 1 (years 1 and 2) of their medical education.

=== Combined degree programs ===
IUSM offers many combined degree programs: an MD/PhD, an MD/MBA in a partnership with the IU Kelley School of Business, an MD/MPH in a partnership with the IU Fairbanks School of Public Health, an MD/MS or MD/MA through various IU schools, an MD/MS BME in a partnership with Purdue University&#x27;s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, and an MD/JD in a partnership with the IU McKinney School of Law. The MD/PhD program, which offers full tuition and a stipend to students, is one of many programs to be designated a Medical Scientist Training Program by the National Institutes of Health. IUSM also offers certificates in various fields.

IUSM also offers baccalaureate to MD (B/MD) programs at the Muncie, Terre Haute, and Evansville campuses; the programs are only available to Hoosiers. Upon successful completion of an undergraduate degree and meeting other academic and testing requirements, students of a B/MD program at Ball State University (Muncie), Indiana State University (Terre Haute), or the University of Evansville, the University of Southern Indiana, or Indiana University Southeast (all for Evansville) will matriculate directly into IUSM at their home campus.

Beginning in the fall of 2024, IUSM will offer a &quot;pathway to medicine&quot; program at the new IU Indianapolis campus. The program is partly the result of IU&#x27;s takeover of the Purdue University School of Science at IUPUI, which allowed for more administrative integration of the school than was previously possible. Seven- and eight-year programs will exist; eligible freshmen admitted into the school of science at the new IU Indianapolis will have direct acceptance into IUSM provided they meet and continue to meet the rigorous program requirements.

=== Scholarly Concentration Program ===
The Scholarly Concentration Program is an optional experience that complements a student&#x27;s core medical curriculum. Students may research topics of personal interest, complete a scholarly project, and submit a manuscript for publication along with a poster presentation of their project. Projects are traditionally begun in the first year, with presentation and publication by the end of year four. Each campus hosts one to four topics that leverage the expertise of that particular campus.

The following are the concentration topics available at each campus:
== Campuses ==

The school&#x27;s main facilities are located on IU Indy&#x27;s campus in Indianapolis. In addition, the school maintains eight regional centers on college campuses throughout the state at Bloomington (IU Bloomington), Muncie (Ball State University), Fort Wayne (IU Fort Wayne), South Bend (University of Notre Dame), Terre Haute (Indiana State University), Evansville, West Lafayette (Purdue University), and Northwest–Gary (IU Northwest).

First- and second-year medical students attend classes at either the main campus at IU Indianapolis Indianapolis or at one of the eight regional centers. Students may elect to complete all coursework and clerkships at a regional center, or transfer to the Indianapolis campus for third- and fourth-year clerkships. Regional center students part of the Early Decision Program (a program where Indiana residents apply to only IUSM and are notified of a decision by October 1 of that application cycle) are required to complete the majority of their third- and fourth-year clinical clerkships at their regional center. Due to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accreditation requirement stating that students must have some interaction with a resident physician, campuses that do not have a nearby residency program must allow students to attend at least one third-year rotation at a campus that does.

=== Bloomington ===
IUSM traces its roots to Bloomington, being founded there in 1903 by president William Lowe Bryan. The Bloomington medical school building was constructed in 1937 using funds from the Works Progress Administration. Following the opening of VanNuys in 1958 and subsequent movement of all medical education to Indianapolis, the Bloomington medical science building was renamed as Myers Hall in honor of medical school dean Burton D. Myers. Not wanting Myers Hall to go unused, IU president Herman B. Wells secured funding for an advanced degree program that combined the first two years of basic science training of the MD program with a master&#x27;s degree or PhD. A similar program was available at Stanford University at the time. About half of the Bloomington medical school faculty moved, with the remaining half forming the Department of Anatomy and Physiology at IU Bloomington. Medical education resumed at Bloomington in the early 1960s.

In 2002, IUSM–Bloomington traded spaces with the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute in response to both institutions&#x27; growing needs, with the school relocating to a modified space in the basement of Jordan Hall, now known simply as the Biology Building.

In August 2021, IUSM–Bloomington, the Bloomington campuses of the School of Nursing and the School of Social Work, and the IU Bloomington Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences moved into the newly constructed Health Sciences Building, a part of the Regional Academic Health Center (the RAHC). The RAHC also houses IU Health Bloomington Hospital and is located northeast of IU Bloomington&#x27;s campus at the corner of East Discovery Parkway and State Road 45.

Prior to the 2023 academic year, third-year clerkships at the Bloomington campus were longitudinal, as opposed to the standard block schedule found at other IUSM campuses. Founded in 2012, the Bloomington Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (BLIC) program was a unique aspect of the Bloomington campus and was a motivating factor for students to stay on a regional campus for their clinical education. For example, instead of doing a 4-week rotation in neurology, an 8-week rotation in pediatrics, and then an 8-week rotation in surgery, students would be in a neurology clinic on Monday, a pedatrics clinic on Tuesday, and an operating room on Wednesday, and so on for select rotations for most of third year. Due to the nature of this schedule, clerkship National Board of Medical Examiners shelf exams, which are normally taken at the end of a rotation, were all taken at similar times at the conclusion of the program. Because of the intense, multi-subject studying required throughout the program, BLIC students consistently scored higher on shelf exams and on Step 2 CK. Another benefit of BLIC was the development of long-term, meaningful relationships with faculty and patients. The end of BLIC and IUSM–Bloomington&#x27;s transition to a block schedule was announced in early 2022, in part because the program was very challenging to coordinate and due to higher-level school administrative pressure for each IUSM campus to be more uniform and less autonomous.

===Evansville===
The Evansville campus was founded in 1972 as part of IUSM&#x27;s regional campus system founded in 1971 which would allow medical students to complete their first and second years away from Indianapolis. The first class of five students split their time between Indiana State University–Evansville (which would become the University of Southern Indiana [USI] in 1985) and the University of Evansville (UE). Students attended gross anatomy lab in the back of UE&#x27;s student union until better arrangements were established. In 1994, all courses moved to USI&#x27;s Health Professions Center and in 2014, students were able to complete all four years at the regional campus. In 2018, courses moved to the new Stone Family Center for Health Sciences in downtown Evansville.

The Evansville campus includes expanded graduate medical education residencies through a consortium model with the Deaconess Health System, St. Vincent Evansville, Memorial Hospital and Health Care, and Owensboro Health.

In 2013, Indiana University, the University of Evansville, the University of Southern Indiana, and Ivy Tech Community College jointly signed letters of intent to co-locate a new interdisciplinary academic health science education in research campus in the Evansville region. The new campus was expected to open fall 2018. The interdisciplinary campus plan included a simulation center with an advanced collaborative space. The facility was planned to be a combination of immersive training space, research, and potential product development. Following a $15 million donation from philanthropists and Evansville natives Bill and Mary Stone, the new building was named the Stone Family Center for Health Sciences.

In addition to the Evansville campus of IUSM, the Stone Center also houses healthcare and related programs from USI, UE, and Ivy Tech.

=== Fort Wayne ===
IUSM–Fort Wayne is IUSM&#x27;s newest campus, being founded in 1981 when it moved into the third floor of a classroom and laboratory building at IPFW. In 2009, it moved to a new 43,000-square-foot medical education building. IUSM–Fort Wayne is located on the campus of IU Fort Wayne, which shares a 688-acre campus with Purdue Fort Wayne.

=== Indianapolis ===
IUSM–Indianapolis is IUSM&#x27;s flagship campus, but not its oldest. It traces its founding to 1908 following the resolution of a rivalry with Purdue.

=== Muncie ===
The Muncie campus was founded in 1971 as one of the first campuses of the new regional campus system. Its first class of four students was met by an illustrious welcoming committee consisting of Ball State University&#x27;s president, vice president, and the dean of the graduate school. Originally, students undergoing rotations at Ball Memorial Hospital had a &quot;buddy system&quot; where they were assigned a family practice resident and rounded with them; they also had to observe an autopsy prior to class registration. These are no longer requirements for Muncie students, though a cadaver dissection is still a part of the statewide human anatomy course taught at the beginning of first year.

=== Northwest–Gary ===
IUSM&#x27;s Gary campus was created from scratch, unlike other the other regional campuses that occupied spaces at existing four-year institutions. Its original class of four students and five faculty set up shop at a building in East Chicago in 1972. It moved into trailers located on IU Northwest&#x27;s campus in 1975 as it awaited the construction of new buildings, which were completed soon after. It moved into the Dunes Medical Professional Building in 2005, where it remains today.

=== South Bend ===
The South Bend campus was one of the first regional campuses, being founded at Notre Dame in 1968 as part of the regional campus pilot project along with the West Lafayette campus at Purdue. Its first class of two students took part in &quot;clinical correlation&quot; courses by visiting family clinics on weekends, a practice that is now included statewide. IUSM–South Bend students are additionally dual-enrolled as graduate students at Notre Dame, allowing them access to Notre Dame&#x27;s facilities and the benefits of being a student there, such as reduced football ticket prices.

=== Terre Haute ===
The Terre Haute campus was founded in 1971 and immediately faced a good problem—an inverted teacher-to-student ratio. This was due in part to many willing faculty at Indiana State to teach medical students. IUSM–Terre Haute is also home to IUSM&#x27;s Rural Medicine Education Program, which integrates the curriculum of medical school with delivering care in a rural setting. Students at the Terre Haute campus may precept with rural physicians weekly during their first two years of medical school.

=== West Lafayette ===
While IUSM–West Lafayette traces its founding class of three medical students to 1968 as one of the first regional campuses, medical education in the Lafayette area has a history of more than 125 years. Purdue University&#x27;s own department of medicine was founded there in the late 19th century, and it would exist as the School of Medicine of Purdue University from 1905 to 1908; thus, the Purdue School of Medicine was one of the component parts that contributed to the creation of the modern IUSM. Purdue&#x27;s College of Pharmacy was established in 1884, and its School of Nursing was founded in 1963. Medical students at the West Lafayette campus routinely interact with pharmacy, nursing, allied health professions, and other healthcare-related students throughout their education.

For 40 years, IUSM–West Lafayette occupied a space in the basement of Lynn Hall, the home of Purdue&#x27;s College of Veterinary medicine and animal hospital; it moved to the second floor of the nearby 60,000-square-foot Lyles–Porter Hall in 2014, a space it shares with other programs of Purdue&#x27;s College of Health and Human Sciences. Clinical rotations are completed in area clinics, at IU Health Arnett Hospital, and at Franciscan Health Lafayette East Hospital.

Medical students at the West Lafayette campus can access a wide range of support services through both IUSM and Purdue University, as they are additionally dual-enrolled as graduate students in the Purdue University system and receive a Purdue University ID. This provides them access to a wide range of opportunities, such as the ability to check out materials from Purdue&#x27;s libraries, access to recreational gyms and pools, and free rides on the Greater Lafayette CityBus. Students may also enjoy a Big Ten campus atmosphere that includes seminars, sports, arts, music festivals and performances, and many other cultural events.

In addition, students may pursue dual degrees through Purdue University, such as an MD/PhD, MD/MPH through Purdue&#x27;s Department of Public Health, MD/MS through Purdue&#x27;s College of Science, MD/MBA through the Daniels School of Business, and an MD/MS BME though the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering.

==Clinical training facilities==

IUSM helps train interns and residents in 92 medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. In Indianapolis, students train under the supervision of faculty and staff at IU Health Methodist Hospital, IU Health University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, and Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital. Most of the Indianapolis teaching hospitals are within walking distance or adjacent to IU Indy. Methodist Hospital is located a few miles from the main campus.

IUSM has a partnership program with the Moi University School of Medicine in Eldoret, Kenya through AMPATH where students may complete a double rotation in their fourth year. Selection is based on an application and lottery system, as the program is very popular.

Regional campus students may complete rotations at other various physician offices and hospitals throughout the state of Indiana, such as Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie, hospitals and clinics affiliated with the Deaconess Health System of the Illinois–Indiana–Kentucky tri-state area, Indiana University Health-affiliated hospitals and clinics, and many others.

== Discoveries at IUSM ==
The school was the first to develop the use of echocardiography, a heart imaging technique using ultrasound. In the 1960s, Mori Aprison discovered the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Dr. Paul Stark, another neuroscientist and faculty member at IUSM, led the clinical team at Eli Lilly and Company in the development of fluoxetine (Prozac), a widely prescribed antidepressant. In 1984, IUSM established the first DNA &quot;bank&quot; in the world; blood samples from clients were used to extract DNA which could indicate the genetic risk for certain illnesses and conditions. The school researchers also discovered the use of cord blood as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells and pioneered their use in the clinic. In the early 1990s, the school was one of the first institutions to study the use of computer systems in reducing the costs of healthcare management.

IUSM is the home of a National Cancer Institute-designated Clinical Cancer Center, and the only National Institute of Health-funded viral vector production facility for clinical grade therapeutics. The school is known for establishing a curative therapy for testicular cancer. The school has been a pioneer in establishing a cure for Fanconi anemia (a precancerous condition in children), specific radiation therapy techniques, techniques in a type of nerve-sparing surgery for urological cancers, the development of drugs to stimulate blood cell production, and novel drug therapies for breast cancer. Researchers at the medical school also discovered the cancer-fighting agent in tamoxifen. In 2011, the school announced plans for an institute specializing in personalized medicine, which would pursue an individualized and genomics-based approach to treating cancer, pediatrics, and obstetrics.

In 2012, federal officials designated IUSM and the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana as a Traumatic Brain Injury Model System site. As one of sixteen sites in the United States, the federally-funded center received a five-year, $2 million grant to research and treat traumatic brain injury and its impact on the lives of patients and their families. IUSM is also a member of the NCAA and the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s CARE Consortium, a $30 million initiative to study concussions among student-athletes and use that knowledge to improve safety and health of athletes, military service members, and the general public. CARE Consortium research includes the exploration of post-concussive symptoms; the performance and psychological health of student-athletes; and the analysis of data related to biomechanical, clinical, neuroimaging, neurobiological, and genetic markers of injury.
