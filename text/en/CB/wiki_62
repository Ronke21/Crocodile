<text>Internet activism involves the use of electronic-communication technologies such as social media, e-mail, and podcasts for various forms of activism to enable faster and more effective communication by citizen movements, the delivery of particular information to large and specific audiences, as well as coordination. Internet technologies are used by activists for cause-related fundraising, community building, lobbying, and organizing. A digital-activism campaign is &quot;an
organized public effort, making collective claims on a target authority, in which civic initiators or supporters use digital media.&quot; Research has started to address specifically how activist/advocacy groups in the U.S. and in Canada use social media to achieve digital-activism objectives.

== Types ==
Within online activism Sandor Vegh distinguished three principal categories: active/reactive, organization/mobilization, and awareness/advocacy based. Active/reactive refers to either being proactive in efforts to bring about change or reacting to issues after they happen. Organization/mobilization refers to gathering people and information together for online or offline activism. Awareness/advocacy refers to sharing information to make others aware of an issue or advocating for issues and campaigns. There are other ways of classifying Internet activism, such as by the degree of reliance on the Internet versus offline mobilization. Thus, Internet sleuthing or hacking could be viewed as purely online forms of activism, whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement was mainly conducted offline, and only partially online.

== Development processes ==

Exploring the dynamics of online activism for expressing resistance to a powerful organization, a study developed a critical mass approach to online activism. The results were integrated in a four-year longitudinal process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites&#x27; reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. The process model suggests a complex interplay among stakeholders&#x27; interests, opportunities for activism, costs, and outcomes that are neither foreseen nor entirely predictable. The authors challenge universal access to the Internet as a convenient and cost-free forum for practicing social activism by organizational stakeholders (customers, employees, outside parties). In fact, the technology enablers of social activism also enable its filtering and repression, and thus, more extreme states of information asymmetry may result in which powerful elites preserve their status and impose a greater digital divide.

In one study, a discussion of a developmental model of political mobilization is discussed. By citizens joining groups and creating discussion, they are beginning their first stage of involvement. Progressively, it is hoped that they will begin signing petitions online and graduating to offline contact as long as the organization provides the citizen with escalating steps of involvement (Vitak et al., 2011).

The issue of the mass media&#x27;s centrality has been highly contested, with some people arguing that it promoted the voices of marginalized groups while others believe it sends forth the messages of the majority alone, leaving minority groups to have their voices robbed.

== Examples of early activism ==
One early instance of online activism was opposition to the release of Lotus Marketplace. On April 10, 1990, Lotus announced a direct-mail marketing database product that was to contain name, address, demographic, and spending habit information on 120 million individual U.S. citizens. While much of the same data was already available elsewhere, privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data collected within one easily searchable database. Furthermore, the data would be distributed on CD-ROM and could not be changed until a new edition was released.

In response, a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started, which included information on contacting Lotus and form letters. Larry Seiler, a New England–based computer professional, posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: &quot;It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU, which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs. It seems to me (and to a lot of other people, too) that this will be a little too much like big brother, and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time.&quot; Over 30,000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database. On January 23, 1991, Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace.

In 1998 Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living New Jersey, created a website called &quot;Bongo Doit Partir&quot; (Bongo Must Go) to encourage a revolution against the regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. In July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known to be members of &quot;Bongo Doit Partir&quot;. The members were detained for three months.

Another well-known example of early Internet activism took place in 1998, when the Mexican rebel group EZLN used decentralized communications, such as cell phones, to network with developed world activists and help create the anti-globalization group Peoples Global Action (PGA) to protest the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva. The PGA continued to call for &quot;global days of action&quot; and rally support of other anti-globalization groups in this way.

Later, a worldwide network of Internet activist sites, under the umbrella name of Indymedia, was created to provide coverage of the 1999 Seattle WTO protests. Dorothy Kidd quotes Sheri Herndon in a July 2001 telephone interview about the role of the Internet in the anti-WTO protests: &quot;The timing was right, there was a space, the platform was created, the Internet was being used, we could bypass the corporate media, we were using open publishing, we were using multimedia platforms. So those hadn&#x27;t been available, and then there was the beginning of the anti-globalization movement in the United States.&quot;

&quot;Kony 2012&quot;, a short film released on March 5, 2012, was intended to promote the charity&#x27;s &quot;Stop Kony&quot; movement to Ugandan militant Joseph Kony globally known the hopes of having him arrested by the campaign&#x27;s scheduled expiration at the end of 2012 The film spread virally. A poll suggested that more than half of young adult Americans heard about &quot;Kony 2012&quot; in the days following the video&#x27;s release. It was included among the top international events of 2012 by PBS and called the most viral video ever by &quot;TIME&quot;.

== Uses ==

Internet activism has had the effect of causing increased collective action among people, as found by Postmes and Brunsting (2002), who discovered a tendency among internet users to rely on internalized group memberships and social identities in order to achieve social involvement online. 
The Internet is &quot;tailor-made for a populist, insurgent movement,&quot; says Joe Trippi, who managed the Howard Dean campaign. In his campaign memoir, &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,&quot; Trippi notes that:

[The Internet&#x27;s] roots in the open-source ARPAnet, its hacker culture, and its decentralized, scattered architecture make it difficult for big, establishment candidates, companies and media to gain control of it. And the establishment loathes what it can&#x27;t control. This independence is by design, and the Internet community values above almost anything the distance it has from the slow, homogeneous stream of American commerce and culture. Progressive candidates and companies with forward-looking vision have an advantage on the Internet, too. Television is, by its nature, a nostalgic medium. Look at Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign ads in the 1980sthey were masterpieces of nostalgia promising a return to America&#x27;s past glory and prosperity. The Internet, on the other hand, is a forward-thinking and forward-moving medium, embracing change and pushing the envelope of technology and communication.

=== Spreading information ===
The Internet is a key resource for independent activists, particularly those whose message may run counter to the mainstream. Listservs like Freedom News Group or BurmaNet assist in spreading news that would otherwise be inaccessible in these countries. Internet activists also organize petitions to be sent to the government as well as interest groups and organizations to protest or argue for change. Many non-profits and charities use these methods, emailing petitions to those on their email list and asking people to pass them on. The Internet also enables organizations such as NGOs to communicate with individuals in an inexpensive and timely manner. Indeed, many non-profit and advocacy organizations rely on the internet to launch campaigns with socially conscious messages to maintain a constant stream of revenue.

===Hashtag activism===

Hashtag activism is the use of hashtags for fighting or supporting a cause through the usage of social media outlets. The term &quot;hashtag activism&quot; first started circulating within journalism in 2011. Since then, its use has been associated with movements such as #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, #SayHerName, and many more.

One example of the powerful rise of hashtag activism can be seen in the black feminist movement&#x27;s use of hashtags to convey their cause. The famous hashtag &quot;IamJada&quot; was an internet backlash to the mocking &quot;#Jadapose&quot; that went viral, ensuing after sixteen-year-old girl Jada Smith was photographed following her gang rape In this instance, a hashtag was employed to convey a powerful anti-rape message.

Yet another instance of where this type of activism was utilized for the matter of feminism and women&#x27;s right, occurred in China in relation to the outbreak of COVID-19. While the rule of the country put efforts into trying to hide and downplay the start of what would develop into the pandemic, pressured hospitals were in need of supplies in form of menstrual protection and related products. Supplies which they, despite the fact that the vast majority of the medical workers is made up of females, were not given access to. Amongst others, hashtags such as #RefusePeriodShame, circulated in protest to the ongoing situation and the Wuhan hospital authorities, who were considered responsible for it. Soon to follow on the same thread, one of the VTubers of the Chinese Communist Youth Party League (CYL), known as Jiangshanjiao, an avatar displayed as a youthful female, gave rise to #JiangshanjiaoDoYouGetYourPeriod. The hashtag initially sparked from a post on Weibo where a user sarcastically wrote that exact question, to point out the absurdness in the societal denial of women&#x27;s biological functions and needs. #JiangshanjiaoDoYouGetYourPeriod, while, like the previous hashtag mentioned, being censored and taken down by the government, had time to spread and catch a lot more attention than what #RefusePeriodShame did, and up until 15 March 2020, it accumulated over 89,200,000 views.

Other notable instances in which marginalized groups have used hashtags as organizing tools for social justice include responses to racial violence and police profiling, as in the case of #BlackLivesMatter and #JusticeForTrayvon, along with misogyny and gendered violence, such as #MeToo and #YesAllWomen.

==== Black Lives Matter ====

One of the most prominent uses of hashtag activism is #BlackLivesMatter, a social justice movement that first began after George Zimmerman was acquitted for the shooting and killing of Trayvon Martin, an African American teenage boy. The movement started as a hashtag and now it has been at the forefront of the fight against police brutality and racial profiling across the world.

After the killing of Martin on February 26, 2012, several people wanted justice. The hashtag started to grow in popularity, with a Change.org petition calling for an investigation and prosecution of George Zimmerman. Social media users, including many celebrities retweeted, shared, and created new petitions, eventually raising over 2.1 million signatures combined by March 26, 2012. By April 11, 2012, Zimmerman was charged with the second-degree murder of Trayvon Martin.

After George Zimmerman was acquitted on July 13, 2013, a &quot;letter to Black folks&quot; was posted to Facebook by Alicia Garza. Garza ended her letter with the statement &quot;Black lives matter&quot;, which her friend turned into a hashtag below. From here, #BlackLivesMatter or simply &quot;BLM&quot; became the movement against police brutality and killings of unarmed African Americans, as well as hate crimes and racially motivated crimes.

#BlackLivesMatter&#x27;s impact does not end online. The formation of Black Lives Matter allowed for activists across the United States to organize in-person protests and rallies together, no matter where they may be located. U.S. politicians—such as Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—have endorsed Black Lives Matter, aligning themselves with a push for racial justice.

The most recent display of how the Black Lives Matter movement has been used as a platform for offline activism is the 2020 BLM protests that occurred after 17-year old Darnella Frazier live-streamed on Facebook the murder of George Floyd by then-police officer Derek Chauvin. Protests took place in all 50 states, as well as in many countries around the world.

==== March For Our Lives ====
After the Parkland high school shooting on February 14, 2018, #MarchForOurLives was born. Students came together to create this hashtag to fight for gun control in the U.S. This hashtag turned into an entire movement of over 800 protests across the United States with the main protest taking place in Washington, D.C. There was an estimated 200,000 people in attendance at the Washington, D.C. protest, alone.

=== TikTok ===
TikTok&#x27;s platform has been increasingly used for raising up social issues through creative short videos, especially after an allegedly make-up tutorial turned into a call to action on China&#x27;s treatment of Muslim Uighurs. The tutorial was banned for 50 minutes on November 26, 2019. Eric Han, the heads of TikTok&#x27;s US content-moderation team, claimed the banning was due to a “human moderation error”. The Chinese owners declared the app does not remove content based on sensitivities to China.
TikTok also partnered up with UN Women in a campaign fighting women violence in India which kicked off on November 25, 2019. The campaign can be found under the hashtag #KaunsiBadiBaatHai and features short videos with positive and negative examples of men interacting with women.

In July 2020, the TikTok platform played a major role in the #FreeBritney movement surrounding Britney Spears and her conservatorship dispute. Though such activism led to a significant increase in public awareness of the case, it was criticized for spreading misinformation regarding the conservatorship alongside a number of conspiracy theories of varying accuracy.

=== Use in political campaigns ===

==== 2004 Presidential Campaign ====
When discussing the 2004 U.S. presidential election candidates, Carol Darr, director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., said of the candidates which benefited from use of the Internet to attract supporters: &quot;They are all charismatic, outspoken mavericks and insurgents. Given that the Internet is interactive and requires an affirmative action on the part of the users, as opposed to a passive response from TV users, it is not surprising that the candidate has to be someone people want to touch and interact with.&quot;

A more decentralized approach to campaigning arose, in contrast to a top-down, message-focused approach usually conducted in the mainstream. &quot;The mantra has always been, &#x27;Keep your message consistent. Keep your message consistent,&#x27;&quot; said John Hlinko, who has participated in Internet campaigns for MoveOn.org and the electoral primary campaign of Wesley Clark. &quot;That was all well and good in the past. Now it&#x27;s a recipe for disaster. You can choose to have a Stalinist structure that&#x27;s really doctrinaire and that&#x27;s really opposed to grassroots. Or you can say, &#x27;Go forth. Do what you&#x27;re going to do.&#x27; As long as we&#x27;re running in the same direction, it&#x27;s much better to give some freedom.&quot;

==== 2008 Presidential Campaign ====

Two-thirds of Internet users under the age of 30 have an SNS, and during the 2008 election, half of them used an SNS site for candidate information (Hirzalla, 2010). MoveOn.org endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008, and used this endorsement as an opportunity to encourage grassroots advertising. MoveOn hosted a competition that requested submissions from ordinary citizens with the criteria the digital ads were positive towards Obama. The contest drew 1,000 entries of 30-second ads for Obama that streamed on YouTube. This endorsement by a grassroots organization, and the ensuing contest, is an example of agenda setting that scholars have been studying ever since social media and digital content began influencing presidential politics.

Studies delving into the 2008 presidential campaign examined inequality online of various ideologies deriving from various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Scholars concluded the 2008 race, and the influence of online politicking, did not see an empowerment of new voices. The idea that digital literacy become a concept taught in school, with educators incorporating blogging, commenting, and creating content as part of their curriculum, has been bandied about among social and political scientists in an effort to turn online enthusiasm from young people into demonstrable results at the ballot box.

==== 2016 Presidential Campaign ====
The 2016 presidential election changed the digital landscape again. Digital media scholars note that the hopes of developing digital literacy post 2008 turned into a fomenting distrust of traditional news media. People of all ages and political inclinations gravitated towards social media sources that acted as echo chambers, and online personalities and organizations were held in higher esteem than traditional news sources.

=== Non-traditional activism ===

The Internet has become the catalyst for protests such as Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring as those involved have increasingly relied on social media to organize and stay connected.
In Myanmar, online news paper Freedom News Group has leaked some government corruption and fuel to protests.

In 2017, the Sleeping Giants cyberactivist group, among others, launched a boycott campaign against controversial, conservative webpage Breitbart News, getting more than 2,000 organizations to remove it from ad buys.

=== Corporate activism ===
Corporations are also using Internet activist techniques to increase support for their causes. According to Christopher Palmeri with &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; Online, companies launch sites with the intent to positively influence their own public image, to provide negative pressure on competitors, to influence opinion within select groups, and to push for policy changes.

The clothing manufacturer, American Apparel is an example: The company hosts a website called Legalize LA that advocates immigration reform via blog, online advertising, links to news stories and educational materials. Protest groups have responded by posting YouTube videos and establishing a boycott website.

Corporate methods of information dissemination is labelled &quot;astroturfing&quot;, as opposed to &quot;grassroots activism&quot;, due to the funding for such movements being largely private. More recent examples include the right-wing FreedomWorks.org which organized the &quot;Taxpayer March on Washington&quot; on September 12, 2009, and the Coalition to Protect Patients&#x27; Rights, which opposes universal health care in the U.S.

=== Religious activism ===

Cybersectarianism is a new organizational form which involves: &quot;highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards.&quot;

=== Political activism ===

==== Online extremism ====

The Internet is widely accessible by everyone. Thus, it has, since its beginning, increasingly become a place where various opinions are expressed, and not seldom are those opinions ones from some very far end of the spectrum. Extremists of different sorts have come to heavily rely on the Internet to the point where it is no longer just a means amongst others to achieve a certain objective, but more often than not, it is where the main part of a movement takes place. Activities such as the conveyance of perceivably extreme, bureaucratic ideas, or even the outlining of strategic acts of violence or destruction, are ones nowadays likely to occur online. In other words, this type of &quot;online extremism&quot; could, though difficult to precisely define, be described as the subcategory of Internet activism that is brought forward by, or connected with, individuals or groups that possess what are generally viewed to be extreme opinions.

==== White Nationalism ====
In 1998, former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke wrote on his website, “I believe that the internet will begin a chain reaction of racial enlightenment that will shake the world by the speed of its intellectual conquest.” White nationalists quickly saw the potential of the Internet as a platform to effectively disseminate their message to a mass audience.

This exploitation of technological innovations is not a novel concept for this group. In the early 20th century, with the emergence of film technology, the KKK created their own film companies and produced films like &quot;The Toll of Justice (1923)&quot; to spread their message. Then, a century later, with the rise of digital technologies, the KKK adapted to the changing media landscape to become a digital movement. They not only adapted to the digital age, but also found vulnerabilities through which they could most quickly and efficiently insert their ideologies. Examples of this included strategic domain names and hidden propaganda content.

Today, white nationalists&#x27; efforts to push their principles on the Web combined with tech companies&#x27; belief in the Internet as &quot;raceless&quot; motivate white nationalists to continue to exploit algorithms and influence digital spaces such as Twitter. As algorithms work in a self-reinforcing manner, they worsen the psychological effects of confirmation bias. They provide search results that confirm one&#x27;s beliefs and biases and, further, connect one to communities of like-minded people. This works in favor of white nationalists; for example, search engines&#x27; autocomplete features suggest racist notions, and make White supremacist sites readily accessible to users.

===Environmental activism===
One of the earliest books on activism was Don Rittner&#x27;s &quot;Ecolinking: Everyone&#x27;s Guide to Online Environmental Information&quot;, published by Peachpit Press in 1992. Rittner, an environmental activist from upstate New York, spent more than 20 years researching and saving the Albany Pine Barrens. He was a beta tester for America Online and ran their Environmental Forum for the company from 1988 to when it launched in 1990. He took his early environmental knowledge and computer savvy and wrote what was called the bible of the online environmental community. It showed new Net users how to get online, find environmental information, connect to environmentalists around the world, and how to use those resources to save the planet.

In August 2018, a movement of environmental activism was initiated in Sweden, by now widely known climate activist Greta Thunberg. It all started with Greta, 15 years of age at the time and influenced by the creation of #MarchForOurLives, giving her opinion on the ongoing climate change, by displaying a large sign in front of the Swedish Riksdag (parliament) in protest. This act would start the &quot;School Strike for Climate&quot; (SSC) (Swedish: &quot;Skolstrejk för klimatet&quot;), a movement that would eventually spread, largely through attention in media, across the globe and develop into something that came to be internationally named &quot;Fridays for Future&quot; (FFF). Through having children miss classes on Fridays to participate in the strike, it has from the moment it started until today, reached and affected leading governments of the world by raising environmental awareness.

In 2020 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Trust began the #BlossomWatch campaign, which encouraged people to share the first signs of Spring with one another, in particular images of blossom.

=== Sexual assault activism ===
Activism against sexual assault is often led on the internet, where individuals may feel comfortable talking about uncomfortable topics. One such movements is the #NotGuilty movement. This movement began in April 2015 when Ione Wells, an Oxford University student shared a &quot;letter to her attacker&quot; in her college paper. The letter described how she was sexually assaulted and how she chose to respond and build from that point in her life. At the end of the letter she urged readers to send a letter back describing their own sexual assault experience with the hashtag #notguilty. She received so many letters from locals that she decided to create a website called &quot;notGuiltyCampaign.co.uk&quot;. This caused global attention and inspired many to share their stories.

The Me Too movement is a similar movement that started in Hollywood. Initially, the activist Tarana Burke created the phrase back in 2006 to &quot;empower women through empathy&quot;, but first over a decade later, the actress Alyssa Milano gave birth to the usage of the saying that would lead to the eventual spread of it, after using it in a post on Twitter, in which she acknowledged several accusations of sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein. It would from there on not be long until it stretched and attached on various online platforms, and in no more than a day after Milano&#x27;s tweet, the #MeToo hashtag had been reused over 500,000 times on that same media, as well as 4.7 million times on Facebook. The phrase was first used to demonstrate the amount of sexual assault that happens to young actresses and actors in Hollywood, and it was largely due to the early involvement of several well known individuals from the entertainment industry, who used the hashtag in their own posts, that the movement achieved the spread that it did. It soon expanded to apply to all forms of sexual assault, especially in the work place, and with time it also came to move from concerning mainly white heterosexual women, to eventually being used by both men and women with different sexualities and ethnicity.

These movements were intended to create an outlet for men and women to share their experiences with those with similar views without blame or guilt. They brought widespread attention to sexual assault and caused much controversy about changes that should be made accordingly. Criticism around movements such as these centers on concerns about whether or not participants are being dishonest for their own gain or are misinterpreting acts of kindness. However, the same Me Too movement, which also reached Egypt showed the adverse side of the activism where witness detention in one of the high-profile rape cases highlighted the prioritisation of traditional social morality by the government over women&#x27;s rights in the country.

In Samoa, the non-profit organisation Brown Girl Woke began as a campaign on social media in 2014, which transitioned to offline community building and campaigning.

=== Hacktivism ===

Denial-of-Service attacks, the taking over and vandalizing of a website, uploading Trojan horses, and sending out e-mail bombs (mass e-mailings) are also examples of Internet activism. While the concept is difficult to exactly pinpoint, the phrase &quot;hacktivism&quot; summarizes the act of somehow utilizing hacking capabilities as a means to achieve some type of political goal, and the expression is occasionally also referred to as a variation of &quot;cyberterrorism&quot;. The varieties of different routes groups of hacktivists choose to approach the organization, website or forum that they are taking on, can be categorized into different tactics. Some examples of those tactics or strategies are &quot;DDoS attacks&quot;, &quot;Doxing&quot;, and &quot;Webdefacement&quot;, all of which are slightly different ways of reaching an often similar end goal. For additional understanding and explanation, as well as for more specific examples of these types of subversive actions, see hacktivism.

== Impact on everyday political discussions ==

According to some observers, the Internet may have considerable potential to reach and engage opinion leaders who influence the thinking and behavior of others. According to the Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet, what they call &quot;Online Political Citizens&quot; (OPCs) are &quot;seven times more likely than average citizens to serve as opinion leaders among their friends, relatives and colleagues… Normally, 10% of Americans qualify as Influentials. Our study found that 69% of Online Political Citizens are Influentials.&quot;

== Information communication technologies ==
Information communication technologies (ICTs) make communication and information readily available and efficient. There are millions of Facebook accounts, Twitter users and websites, and one can educate oneself on nearly any subject. While this is for the most part a positive thing, it can also be dangerous. For example, people can read up on the latest news events relatively easily and quickly; however, there is danger in the fact that apathy or fatigue can quickly arise when people are inundated with so many messages, or that the loudest voice on a subject can often be the most extreme one, distorting public perception on the issue.

These social networks which occupy ICTs are simply modern forms of political instruments which pre-date the technological era. People can now go to online forums or Twitter instead of town hall meetings. People can essentially mobilize worldwide through the Internet. Women can create transnational alliances and lobby for rights within their respective countries; they can give each other tips and share up-to-date information. This information becomes &quot;hyper textual&quot;, available in downloadable formats with easy access for all. The UN organizations also use &quot;hyper textual&quot; formats. They can post information about upcoming summits, they can post newsletters on what occurred at these meetings, and links to videos can be shared; all of this information can be downloaded at the click of a button. The UN and many other actors are presenting this information in an attempt to get a certain message out in the cyber sphere and consequently steer public perception on an issue.

With all this information so readily available, there is a rising trend of &quot;slacktivism&quot; or &quot;clicktivism&quot;. While it is positive that information can be distributed so quickly and efficiently all around the world, there is negativity in the fact that people often take this information for granted, or quickly forget about it once they have seen it flash across our computer screens. Viral campaigns are great for sparking initial interest and conversation, but they are not as effective in the long term—people begin to think that clicking &quot;like&quot; on something is enough of a contribution, or that posting information about a current hot topic on their Facebook page or Twitter feed means that they have made a difference.

== Fundraising capability ==

The Internet has also made it easier for small donors to play a meaningful role in financing political campaigns. Previously, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised. Groups like MoveOn, however, have found that they can raise large amounts of money from small donors at minimal cost, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. &quot;For the first time, you have a door into the political process that isn&#x27;t marked &#x27;big money,&#x27; &quot; says Darr. &quot;That changes everything.&quot;

The Internet also allows ordinary people to contribute materially to Humanitarian relief projects designed to intervene in situations of global disaster or tragedy, as in the case of the &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; telethon event, which was launched three days after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. The telethon and its broadcast became an effective vehicle to present a plea for support and to collect contributions quickly, facilitating a relationship between entertainment and humanitarian fundraising that has developed in response to historical and economic market conditions.

== Ethics ==
With internet technology vastly changing existing and introducing new mechanisms by which to attain, share and employ information, internet activism raises ethical issues for consideration. Proponents contend internet activism serves as an outlet for social progress but only if personal and professional ethics are employed. Supporters of online activism claim new information and communications technologies help increase the political power of activist groups that would otherwise have less resources. Proponents along this line of thinking claim the most effective use of online activism is its use in conjunction with more traditional or historical activism activities. Conversely, critics worry about facts and beliefs becoming indistinct in online campaigns and about &quot;sectors of online activism [being] more self-interested than socially interested.&quot; These critics warn against the manipulation commonplace to online activism for private or personal interests such as exploiting charities for monetary gain, influencing voters in the political arena and inflating self-importance or effectiveness. In this sense, the ethical implication is that activism becomes descriptive rather than transformative of society. One of these reviewers suggests seven pitfalls to beware of in internet activism: &quot;self-promotion at the expense of the movement... unsolicited bulk email... Hacktivism... violating copyright... nagging... violating privacy... and being scary.&quot; Many of the ethical criticisms against the prevalence of online activism are further discussed in the criticisms section of this article.

== Criticism ==

=== Demographic issues ===
Critics argue that Internet activism faces the same challenges as other aspects of the digital divide, particularly the global digital divide. Some say it gives disproportionate representation to those with greater access or technological ability. Groups that may be disadvantaged by the move to activist activity online are those that have limited access to technologies, or lack the technological literacy to engage meaningfully online; these include ethnic and racial minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status, those with lower levels of education, and the elderly. Issues like racism and sexism are issues that internet activists reportedly deal with.

A study looked at the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) on various demographics and their political activity. Not surprisingly college students used SNS for political activity the most but this was followed by a more unlikely group, those that had not completed high school. In addition the probability for non-White citizens to consume political information was shown to be higher than that of Whites. These two outcomes go in the face of normal predictors of political activity. Despite these surprising findings older generations, men and whites showed the highest levels of political mobilization. Acts of political mobilization, such as fundraising, volunteering, protesting require the most continued interest, resources and knowledge (Nam, 2010).

=== Polarization ===
One concern raised by University of California, Santa Cruz professor Barbara Epstein, is that the Internet &quot;allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case.&quot; She warns that the impersonal nature of communication by computer may actually undermine the human contact that always has been crucial to social movements.

On the other hand, Scott Duke Harris of the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; noted that &quot;the Internet connects [all sides of issues, not just] an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of ANSWER to the pressed-for-time &#x27;soccer moms&#x27; who might prefer MoveOn, and conservative activists as well.&quot;

=== Slacktivism ===

Activist Ralph Nader has stated that &quot;the Internet doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of motivating action&quot;, citing that the United States Congress, corporations and the Pentagon do not necessarily &quot;fear the civic use of the Internet.&quot; Ethan Zuckerman talks about slacktivism, claiming that the Internet has devalued certain currencies of activism. Citizens may &quot;like&quot; an activist group on Facebook, visit a website, or comment on a blog, but fail to engage in political activism beyond the Internet, such as volunteering or canvassing. This critique has been criticized as Western-centric, however, because it discounts the impact this can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts. Journalist Courtney C. Radsch argued that even this low level of engagement was an important form of activism for Arab youth because it is a form of free speech, and can spark mainstream media coverage. University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has argued that the need to put in significant organizing time in the pre-Internet era is what gave street protests their strength. Max Halupka, of the Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society, likens slacktivism to &quot;an impulsive and non-committal online political response.&quot;

Scholars are divided about whether the Internet will increase or decrease political participation, including slacktivism. Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the Internet will decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism. The Pew Research Center has found that platforms create distraction resulting in consumers and online activists believe they are making a difference while their sharing their post is only furthering the echo chamber of media.  The Pew Research Center has also found that about 79% of adults believe that &quot;slacktivism&quot; distracts consumers from issues that are truly important and that the majority of adults found that social media resulted in some of form of negative result.

Journalist and writer Malcolm Gladwell argues that activism through social media and the internet cannot be successful because they promote a &#x27;lazy&#x27; way of activism that doesn&#x27;t require people to put in meaningful effort. For example &#x27;liking&#x27; a protest related post on social media, people feel like they have contributed to a cause, which makes them less likely to take more costly, and some would argue more effective, action like joining a protest.

With cases such as the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, it shows how internet activism can become more than slacktivism. Scholars have found that internet activist communities and offline activist communities work closely together, rather than being two separate entities. With internet activism, activists can organize without the constraints of physical location. The Pew Research Center has found that eight-in-ten Americans have been proven effecting in spreading information and awareness for varying public issues.

Whether this is due to physical, mental, or financial constraints, internet activism may be the most accessible and comfortable for disabled people. If able to attend a physical protest, the inaccessibility of public spaces is often too large of a roadblock to participation.

==== Performative activism ====

Similar to slacktivism, performative activism refers to the action of acting as if one is an advocate or activistoften on social mediafor personal gain. This term is used as a negative term towards those who seem to be untruthful or exaggerating their activism work. Performative activism became frequently used after the 2020 BLM protests, this term started to become widely used as many took to social media to participate in the Black Lives Matter movement. The intentions of a lot of new activists and allies were questioned. On June 2, 2021, the social media platform, Instagram, was flooded with millions of the same image. These images were black squares under the hashtag, #BlackoutTuesday. The purpose of this online protest was to amplify Black voices on social media. However, many criticized this protest, arguing that the protest had the opposite effect as the squares flooded the important #BlackLivesMatter hashtag. People started to accuse those who participated in Blackout Tuesday, but did not do anything else in regards to the Black Lives Matter movement, of being performative activists.

=== State repression ===

In &quot;Net Delusion&quot;, author Evgeny Morozov argues against cyberutopianism. He describes how the Internet is successfully used against activists and for the sake of state repression. China presents a good example of this. Internet censorship in China has often been used as a way to achieve political stability of the Chinese Communist Party. The most well known example of internet censorship in China is the Covid-19 virus when China suppressed any information regarding the virus. Information was able to get out though because of Dr. Li Wenliang, but was considered to be falsified.

<doc id="827158" wikidata="Q2633854" url="?curid=827158" title="Moral imperative">
<text>A moral imperative is a strongly-felt principle that compels a person &quot;in question&quot; to act. It is a kind of categorical imperative, as defined by Immanuel Kant. Kant took the imperative to be a dictate of pure reason, in its practical aspect. Not following the moral law was seen to be self-defeating and thus contrary to reason. Later thinkers took the imperative to originate in conscience, as the divine voice speaking through the human spirit. The dictates of conscience are simply right and often resist further justification. Looked at another way, the experience of conscience is the basic experience of encountering the right.

An example of following a moral imperative is breaking into someone&#x27;s house in order to save a baby in a burning crib.
An example of not following a moral imperative is making a promise, that you do not intend to keep, in order to get something.

<doc id="827160" wikidata="Q3455056" url="?curid=827160" title="Registered education savings plan">
<text>A registered education savings plan (, RESP) in Canada is an investment vehicle available to caregivers to save for their children&#x27;s post-secondary education. The principal advantages of RESPs are the access they provide to the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) and as a method of generating tax-deferred income.

==Tax benefits==
An RESP is a tax shelter designed to benefit post-secondary students. With an RESP, contributions (comprising the investment&#x27;s principal) are, or have already been, taxed at the contributor&#x27;s tax rate, while the investment growth (and CESG) is taxed on withdrawal at the recipient&#x27;s tax rate. An RESP recipient is typically a post-secondary student; these individuals generally pay little or no federal income tax due to tuition, education tax credits and the limited ability of a post-secondary student to earn taxable income. Thus, with the tax-free principal contribution available for withdrawal, CESG, and nearly-tax-free interest, the student will have a good source of income to fund their post-secondary education. 
If the beneficiary of an RESP decides not to pursue post-secondary education, the contributor can withdraw all contributions tax-free. However, all interest earned on contributions (&quot;accumulated income&quot;) are taxed at the contributor&#x27;s regular income-tax level, plus an additional 20 percent. 

==Government grants==
===Federal grants===
====Canada Education Savings Grant====
The Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) is provided to complement RESP contributions, wherein the government of Canada contributes 20% of the first $2,500 in annual contributions made to an RESP. After changes introduced in the 2007 Canadian federal budget, the government may contribute up to $500 per year to a participating RESP, to a lifetime maximum of $7,200. This income is available upon withdrawal from the RESP by a post-secondary recipient, with a maximum lifetime contribution of $50,000. Any contributions over this amount are subject to taxation. 

The government grants introduced in 2005, entitled &quot;Additional CESG&quot;, allowed an additional 10% or 20% for a total of an extra 30 or 40 cents on each dollar of the first $500 contributed to an RESP, depending on the family income of the beneficiary&#x27;s primary caregiver. An application is made through the promoter of the RESP, which is often a bank, mutual fund company or group RESP provider.

====Canada Learning Bond====
The Government of Canada also provides a Canada Learning Bond (CLB) to encourage low-income families to contribute to an RESP. Families with children born on or after January 1, 2004, and who receive the National Child Benefit, will receive an additional $500 CLB when they open an RESP and $100 for each year they remain eligible.

===Provincial grants===
====Alberta Centennial Education Savings Grant====
The Alberta Centennial Education Savings (ACES) grant was introduced in 2005 by the Alberta government to encourage families to begin planning and saving for their children&#x27;s post-secondary education.

The government of Alberta contributes $500 to an RESP for babies born to or adopted by Alberta residents on or after January 1, 2005. The Alberta government then contributes a $100 Alberta Centennial Education Savings Grant to students who are enrolled in school in Alberta, and have turned the age of 8, 11, or 14 in 2005 or later.

The provincial government announced in March 2013 that the program would be phased out, but did not provide a final date.

The provincial government announced, in March 2015, that the plan is closing in 2015/16 fiscal year. Applicants will no longer be accepted by RESP providers and promoters on or after July 31, 2015.
====Saskatchewan Advantage Grant for Education Savings====
The government of Saskatchewan has announced the Saskatchewan Advantage Grant for Education Savings (SAGES) to benefit children in the province. The legislation was to be implemented in 2013.

====Québec Education Savings Incentive====
The Québec Education Savings Incentive (QESI) was launched in February 2007 and is a tax measure that encourages Québec families to start saving early for the education of their children and grandchildren. Universitas Financial commissioned a financial study in 2006 recommending the creation of an education savings incentive in Quebec and gave a number of presentations for this purpose to the provincial government. 

Each year, Revenu Québec can contribute an amount equal to 10% of the net contributions paid into an RESP over the course of a year, up to a maximum of $250.

==Early withdrawals==
Any principal contributed to the RESP can be withdrawn at any time by its contributor. In this case, any eligible CESG payments on those contributions must be repaid to the Government. If the beneficiary has also received additional CESG, none of the beneficiaries in the plan will be eligible for additional CESG for the next two years. If the student elects to not attend a post-secondary institution, any accumulated interest may be withdrawn by the contributor; this is called an AIP (Accumulated Income payment). To receive this AIP, the plan must be in place for at least 10 years and all beneficiaries must be over 21 years old. This AIP is taxed as income unless it is rolled into a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), subject to individual contribution limits and applicable rules.

==Group plans==
In group RESPs (otherwise known as Group Scholarship RESPs), individual contributions are pooled with those of other contributors. Contributions to the plan are made according to a set schedule for the duration of the RESP contract. In a pooled group plan, the interest that is left behind from cancelled RESPs gets paid out with the matured plans. This excess &quot;interest&quot; is also called attrition.

<doc id="827166" wikidata="Q3547428" url="?curid=827166" title="USS New York (1800)">
<text>USS &quot;New York&quot; was a three-masted, wooden-hulled sailing frigate in the United States Navy that saw service during the Quasi-War with France.

&quot;New York&quot; was built by public subscription by the citizens of New York for the United States Government; laid down in August 1798 by Peck and Carpenter, New York City; launched 24 April 1800; and commissioned in October 1800, Captain Richard Valentine Morris in command as of 18 August, replacing Captain Thomas Robinson who commanded during her construction.

The &quot;New York&quot; was one of the group of five frigates built by the States for the Federal Government to supplement the original six provided for by the Naval Act of 1794, The ship entered the Navy when the Quasi-War with France was being fought in the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans where French warships preyed on American shipping interests.

==Service history==

===Caribbean===
The &quot;New York&quot; departed New York on 22 October 1800, and sailed for the Caribbean, convoying the brig &quot;Amazon&quot; and her cargo to Martinique and then sailing to St. Kitts, arriving on 6 December to meet the frigate there and receive orders. Putting to sea the next day, &quot;New York&quot; cruised the waters near Guadeloupe on patrol protecting U.S. merchant ships until forced to return to St. Kitts on 31 December by a bad outbreak of fever among her crew. The frigate remained in the West Indies port, putting the forty sickest men ashore and recruiting others to replace them until sailing in mid-January 1801 to resume station on watchful patrol against those French ships, both naval vessels and privateers, which had been attacking Yankee merchant ships trading with the British West Indies.

With the ratification of Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty with France on 3 February, she was ordered to return home on 23 March and arrived at New York in late April, remaining there until sailing to Washington in mid-May. &quot;New York&quot; was placed in ordinary at Washington Navy Yard as part of the reserve naval force provided for in the Peace Establishment Act of 1801. The frigate&#x27;s day to day patrolling performed an invaluable service to the nation, not only protecting American commerce, but also helping to establish the United States Navy as a force to be reckoned with. As part of the infant Navy, &quot;New York&quot; had, as President John Adams told Congress of the Navy&#x27;s actions, &quot;raised us in our own esteem; and effected to the extent of our expectations, the objects for which it was created.&quot;

===Barbary Coast===
The frigate recommissioned on 14 August 1802, Captain James Barron in command. The small Moorish kingdoms on the Barbary Coast of North Africa were attacking American ships, killing and imprisoning crewmen and stealing cargo, while demanding high monetary tribute as their price for ending these piratical acts. In response to this challenge, Thomas Jefferson sent a naval squadron to the Mediterranean in May 1801 to protect the nation&#x27;s interests, and on 14 November 1802, &quot;New York&quot; sailed from Washington Navy Yard to reinforce that squadron and join in the blockade. She arrived at Gibraltar 10 December.
 Arriving Gibraltar 6 April 1803, she met the squadron there and became its flagship when Commodore Morris, her first captain, broke his broad pennant from the frigate&#x27;s yardarm.

The squadron sailed on 11 April for Tripoli to confront the Pasha with a strong show of American force. En route on 25 April, a powder explosion in the Gunner&#x27;s Store Room in the cockpit, caused by a candle, set off 444 blank cartridges that killed four men and damaged the ship, the fire taking an hour and a half to extinguish, forcing the squadron to put into Malta from 1–19 May while she effected repairs. Arriving off Tripoli on the 22nd, the squadron remained there attempting negotiations with the Bashaw. Following two brief engagements, 22 and 27 May in which the American ships’ overwhelming fire drove off attacking Tripolitan gunboats, the talks seemed to bear fruit. Midshipman John Downes was one of those recognized for distinguished service on &quot;New York&quot; during the fighting.

On 9 June, a tentative treaty was agreed to on the condition that the U.S. ships would immediately leave the harbor. Commodore Morris, following these terms, sailed in &quot;New York&quot; the next day, leaving the rest of the squadron on guard off the coast to follow later, little realizing that the treacherous Bashaw would resume his piratical activities as soon as the American presence was gone.

===Toward home===
Sailing to Malta 14 June, &quot;New York&quot; received the 17-gun salute of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson and the British Fleet at Valletta. The frigate remained there replenishing and allowing her crew to see the sights of the island until sailing for Gibraltar on 8 July by way of Naples and Málaga and arriving on 14 September. There, she met Commodore Edward Preble and his squadron, sent to relieve Commodore Morris. On the day of her arrival, Captain John Rodgers came aboard to relieve Commodore Morris of command of &quot;New York&quot;. On 11 October, 1803 in Tangier Bay she collided with , receiving damage to her rigging. She sailed for home on 19 October, stopping at Tunis for supplies on 4 November, she returned to Washington Navy Yard on 9 December 1803 and was immediately placed in ordinary.

There &quot;New York&quot; remained for the next eleven years. The frigate was burned by the British in the capture of Washington, D.C., on 24 August 1814 during the War of 1812.

<doc id="827176" wikidata="Q1863253" url="?curid=827176" title="Zurenborg">
<text>Zurenborg is an area in south-east Antwerp largely developed between 1894 and 1906 that features a high concentration of townhouses in Art Nouveau and other fin-de-siècle styles.

Together with Zuid, the urban quarter around the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Zurenborg is unique in Antwerp in that it is among the few areas in the city developed according to an urban plan in the late 19th century. The new neighbourhood reflected Antwerp&#x27;s growing wealth, linked to growing port and trade activities, well. The northern - largest - area of Zurenborg, centered around Dageraadplaats, was mainly developed for the middle class, while the southern area, around Cogels Osylei, was mainly targeted to the well to do. The most eastern corner, which currently includes a bus yard of the public transport company and a power transfer station, was more devoted to industries and logistics, including a gas factory and a terminus station of a regional tram system. Engetrim, a development and construction company, had the lead in developing Zurenborg. Before, Zurenborg was an agricultural area dominated by an estate belonging to the Osy family.

==Houses in Zurenborg==

===Location===
Art Nouveau houses are interspersed with neoclassical mansions and other eclectic architectural styles throughout Zurenborg, which straddles the boundary between Antwerp itself and the district of Berchem. The southern part, which falls within Berchem and is centred on &quot;Cogels-Osylei&quot; (or &quot;Cogels-Osy Lei&quot;), &quot;Transvaalstraat&quot;, and &quot;Waterloostraat&quot;, has the highest number of townhouses. To the north, in the Antwerp section, many further examples were built along the streets surrounding &quot;Dageraadplaats&quot;.

===Styles===
The development of Zurenborg coincided with the peak of Art Nouveau popularity, and that movement had the greatest impact on the stylistic language of the area. However, many other styles—mostly &quot;revival styles&quot;—that were popular at the time are also represented. These include Gothic Revival, Neo-Renaissance, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, and the &quot;cottage style&quot; that coincided with British Tudorbethan architecture.

===Themes===
The houses were often named and decorated with accompanying themes. The influence of organic and natural sources is particularly evident in the themes and names of the Art Nouveau homes: &quot;The Sunflower&quot;, &quot;The Rose&quot;, &quot;The Tulip&quot;, etc. Houses also referenced local history or the names of the streets upon which they stand. The Lion of Flanders prominently adorns Cogels-Osylei 2–4, while across the street an entire complex is devoted to Charlemagne. Some street names refer to the independence war of linguistic affinity, the Boer war in South Africa: &quot;Pretoriastraat&quot;, &quot;Transvaalstraat&quot; and &quot;Krugerstraat&quot;. On Waterloostraat houses recall the eponymous battle. One of them, Waterloostraat 30, is adorned with a silhouette of Napoleon in his characteristic headgear, while another is decorated with glazed ceramic panels depicting scenes from that battle. The façade of no. 11, &quot;The Battle of Waterloo&quot;, shows the portraits of Wellington and Napoleon, the two great commanders of the age. Bayonets, flags, smoking cannons and drums show you clearly the subject of the house.

===Co-ordination of houses===
Groups of individual houses were sometimes combined to form a general theme and are intended to be experienced as co-ordinated designs rather than as individual units. The five adjoining houses collectively known as &quot;De Tijd&quot; (Time) on Waterloostraat make up such an ensemble. Each one, built in brick and in contrasting colours, is named for, and thematically represents, a time of the day: &quot;Ochtend&quot; (Morning), &quot;Dag&quot; (Day), &quot;Avond&quot; (Evening) and &quot;Nacht&quot; (Night). Similarly, some of the structures &quot;speak&quot; to one another. Examples of such a grouping are on the four corners of the Waterloostraat and Generaal Merlenstraat intersection, where houses depicting the four seasons face one another: &quot;Lente&quot; (Spring), &quot;Zomer&quot; (Summer), &quot;Herfst&quot; (Autumn) and &quot;Winter&quot;.

===Architects===
Several architects worked in the neighbourhood. Among them was Joseph Bascourt, who designed 25 of the houses, Jules Hofman, and Frans Smet-Verhas.

== Post World War II history ==
With car ownership rising and upper middle class households moving to the suburbs, the status of Zurenborg - especially Cogels Osylei - as a well-to-do residential area came down. The houses were regarded as too big and too energy consuming. A major plan was made in the 1960s to transform the whole area into a business and office area similar to the one built at Brussels North station. In the end, however, it was concluded that the area was not to be demolished. The area was listed as an item of urban landscape, to the disappointment of many owners who expected to sell their properties at a profit.

The area became popular with artists and entrepreneurs. Many houses became listed monuments. With the help of public subsidies, many owners succeeded in renovating their properties and Zurenborg became a well-functioning urban neighborhood with a variety of people. Dageraadplaats (&quot;Dawn Square&quot;) in the northern part of Zurenborg was transformed from a neighbourhood shopping area into one of the most popular dining areas in Antwerp, and the art nouveau mansions in Zurenborg draw high numbers of visitors and tourists.

<doc id="827182" wikidata="Q380990" url="?curid=827182" title="Cross-cutting concern">
<text>In aspect-oriented software development, cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect several modules, without the possibility of being encapsulated in any of them.
These concerns often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation, and can result in either &quot;scattering&quot; (code duplication), &quot;tangling&quot; (significant dependencies between systems), or both.

For instance, if writing an application for handling medical records, the indexing of such records is a core concern, while logging a history of changes to the record database or user database, or an authentication system, would be cross-cutting concerns since they interact with more parts of the program.

==Background==
Cross-cutting concerns are parts of a program that rely on or must affect many other parts of the system. They form the basis for the development of aspects. Such cross-cutting concerns do not fit cleanly into object-oriented programming or procedural programming.

Cross-cutting concerns can be directly responsible for &quot;tangling&quot;, or system inter-dependencies, within a program. Because procedural and functional language constructs consist entirely of procedure calling, there is no semantic through which two goals (the capability to be implemented and the related cross-cutting concern) can be addressed simultaneously. As a result, the code addressing the cross-cutting concern must be &quot;scattered&quot;, or duplicated, across the various related locations, resulting in a loss of modularity.

Aspect-oriented programming aims to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns into aspects to retain modularity. This allows for the clean isolation and reuse of code addressing the cross-cutting concern. By basing designs on cross-cutting concerns, software engineering benefits can include modularity and simplified maintenance.

==Examples==
Examples of concerns that tend to be cross-cutting include:

* Business rules
* Caching
* Code mobility
* Data validation
* Domain-specific optimizations
* Environment variables and other global configuration settings
* Error detection and correction
* Internationalization and localization which includes Language localisation
* Information security
* Logging
* Memory management
* Monitoring
* Persistence
* Product features
* Real-time constraints
* Synchronization
* Transaction processing
* Context-sensitive help
* Privacy
* Computer security

<doc id="827184" wikidata="Q605895" url="?curid=827184" title="Guaranteed investment certificate">
<text>A guaranteed investment certificate (GIC, ) is a Canadian investment that offers a guaranteed rate of return over a fixed period of time, most commonly issued by trust companies or banks. Due to its low risk profile, the return is generally less than other investments such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. It is similar to a time or term deposit as it is known in other countries.

==Overview==

The rate of return on a GIC varies depending on the various factors, such as the length of the term and specified interest rates from the Bank of Canada. At the time of purchase, the rate is higher than the interest on a savings account. The return on the investment will be low if the savings interest rate becomes higher than the GIC rate of return and will be high otherwise.

The principal amount is not at risk unless the bank defaults. The guarantee for GICs is provided by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) up to a maximum of $100,000 (principal and interest combined), as long as the issuing financial institution is a CDIC member and the original term to maturity is five years or less.

== Market growth GICs ==

The market growth GICs or market stock-indexed GICs have their interest rates determined by the rate of growth of a specific stock market (such as the TSX or S&amp;P 500). For example; if the TSX has a market growth increase of 30% in three years, beginning at the same point in time the GIC was issued, the GIC will return with an interest of 30%. However, unlike other GICs there is always a possibility that the market could perform poorly, having even no growth at all, in which the interest rate could return at 0%. Just like regular GICs, market growth GICs are extremely low-risk; the capital is guaranteed to remain intact (though the purchasing power is not) even if the stock market shrinks.

All market growth GICs have a maximum return. For example; if the GIC has a maximum return of 25% over three years, and the TSX has a market growth increase of 30% in three years, the GIC will return with an interest rate of only 25%. Maximum returns will typically range from 7% to 15% per year, depending on the market in which the GIC is invested and the length of the investment term.

<doc id="827187" wikidata="Q4748608" url="?curid=827187" title="Amra Bangali">
<text>Amra Bangali ( ; ) is a political party in India, based on the socio-economic and political philosophy Progressive Utilization Theory given by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar; the party was sparked off in reaction against anti-Bengali rhetoric in Northeast India. Amra Bangali enjoyed a short stint in the spotlight in the mid-1980s when it even won some gram panchayat seats in border districts. Today, AMB is involved in various movements and protests including those against the Darjeeling Gorkhas calling for the creation of new state of Gorkhaland. It protested National Register of Citizens for Assam and Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.

The politics of Amra Bangali is based on Sarkar&#x27;s ideas of economic and political democracy. The party is organized in West Bengal, as well as in other states with large Bengali populations such as Tripura, Bihar, Odisha, Assam and Jharkhand. The only real political breakthrough the party has had was in Tripura during the 1980s, when the party entered the Legislative Assembly.

Bhuban Bijoy Majumder, resident of Tripura, was a famous leader of the party.

==Bangalistan==
Bangalistan ( ) is the proposed state for the Bengalis in India and self-sufficient socio-economic zone promoted by the supporters of the Indian political party Amra Bangali. Basically, it is a social movement, based on Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar&#x27;s socio-economic and political philosophy PROUT. Bengal or Bangalistan was divided several times in the past. The Mandai Massacre, Nellie Massacre, etc. proves the hurtful conditions of the Bengalis in India. The Amra Bangali protested the National Register of Citizens for Assam. The Bengalis want to reorganize Bangalistan as per the Article 3(a) of Part 1 of the Constitution of India to save themselves from oppression and exploitation. The Bangalistan envisioned by the party would include the whole of West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Tripura, and some parts of Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand.

== Demands ==
The demands of Amra Bangali include:

* Like Marathi, Punjabi, Tamils, etc. are given respective homelands in the federated structure of India, Bengalis should be given their homelands – Bangalistan.
* Bengali language should be used in all official and non-official works all over Bangalistan. 
* The Bengali regiment should be reintroduced into the Indian Army, like Maratha, Sikh etc. regiments.
* All Bengali immigrants should be granted Indian nationality without a question mark. 
* The amendments to Citizenship Charter that were done in the 1986 and 2003 need to be cancelled. 
*In the entire North-East including Manipur– Assam, there is a systematic conspiracy to cancel voting rights of Bengalis and place them in outsiders&#x27; camps – this has to be stopped forthwith.
*The local youths must be given 100% employment as per Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT).
*Block level planning has to be introduced and agro industries have to be established. Agriculture has to be given the status of industry.
*The publication of advertisements and showing of TV serials, cinemas, etc., which are disrespectful to the dignity of women have to be stopped forthwith, etc.

== Aims and objectives ==
The aims and objectives of Amra Bangali include:
* Restoration and development of Bengali language and culture.
* Economic self-sufficiency.
* Self-determination in socio-political field.
*Re-organization of the territory of Bengal with all the like-minded people having respect for Bengali language and culture and giving a new name Bangalistan to this territory.

== Wing organisations ==
The wing organisations of Amra Bangali are:

* Bangali Chhatra–Yuva Samaj
* Bangali Mahila Samaj
* Bangali Kars&#x27;ak Samaj
* Bangali Sramajiibii Samaj
*Bangali Vidvat Samaj

<doc id="827191" wikidata="Q4384968" url="?curid=827191" title="Elena (Street Fighter)">
<text>is a character in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game series who made her first appearance in &quot;Street Fighter III: New Generation&quot; in 1997. A woman with close direct ties to nature, she is the daughter of a Kenyan tribal leader who travels the world to make friends while attending school abroad. Since her debut, she has since appeared in various other media such as comics and manga. She was later included in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;″s third upgrade, &quot;Ultra Street Fighter IV&quot;, and as part of the &quot;Year 2&quot; downloadable content lineup for 2024&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;. She has been voiced by Karen Dyer in English, and Kaoru Fujino, Mie Midori, and Saki Fujita in Japanese.

Designed by Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda with an emphasis on her beauty, Elena has been cited as one of the first black female fighting game characters and the first character in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series from Africa, fighting solely with leg-based attacks using Capoeira. Elena has been praised for her beauty and the fluidity of her motion. She has additionally been called one of the series&#x27; strongest designs by sources such as &quot;Paste&quot; magazine. However, the simplicity of her in-game storylines has faced criticism, and her character design was called out as a cultural stereotype even in light of other series characters. Her light skin and straight hair, among other features, were noted as reflecting European standards of beauty rather than African ones.

==Conception and design==

Designed by Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda and animated by Hiromi &quot;Mori&quot; Kotobuki, the concept started with the desire to include a character from Africa in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, and they chose a female character due to the team feeling a male character would be &quot;stern&quot; and they had enough stern characters as is. They felt Capoeira was a fitting fighting style for her due to the team associating it with female fighters and their belief that African women had long arms and legs. However, this created a problem, as the development team had no experience with the fighting style and had to resort to any material they could find namely travel movies. As the series progressed to the third title in the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series, &quot;3rd Strike&quot;, they focused on letting more of her attacks link more fluidly into one another to enhance her gameplay and the visual effect of her fighting style. An idea was considered to have her be able to attack with the spear shown in her earliest concept art but ultimately abandoned; regardless, it still appears in her &quot;3rd Strike&quot; character portrait.

Elena stands 183 cm tall (6 ft) and has measurements of 83-58-88 cm (33-23-35 in). The team focused on her beauty when creating her, with a design note to give her &quot;plump breasts&quot; and a developer describing her as &quot;Yuki in Africa&quot;, referring to Japanese actress Yuki Uchida. Her outfit consists of a white foldover bikini bottom, and a strip of cloth crisscrossing over her breasts and to her neck, exposing her under cleavage. Red, gold and blue bands completely cover her neck, wrists and portions of her biceps and legs. When designing her outfit, they wanted to make her look &quot;misplaced&quot; alongside the other characters, and her attire was meant to contrast against the other &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; female character at the time, Ibuki. Yasuda struggled a bit with her proportions, in particular positioning her breasts higher on her chest to help offset her long legs.

While later appearances have given her a variety of secondary outfits such as Japanese schoolgirl attire, this has persisted as the character&#x27;s primary outfit in every game until &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, where she is included as part of the &quot;Year 2&quot; content update for the game as a downloadable character. Due to game director Takayuki Nakayama wanting the game to have a character that used Capoeira while also wanting a character that originated from Africa, her design was revised to portray her as more mature. To that end, her hair is now slightly lengthened and several of her bands removed, while her outfit now incorporates white pants with black stripes, a red sash around her neck, and white sandals with a red strap.

==Appearances==
Elena is a Kenyan tribal princess introduced in the 1997 video game &quot;Street Fighter III: New Generation&quot;, whose tribe is dedicated to fighting. She fights using capoeira, which she immediately takes a liking to due to its relation to dance. She seeks to travel the world and make new friends, spending some time studying at a Japanese school and befriending a girl named Narumi, who she later invites to visit her family while studying for her doctorate in France. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, a precursor to &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, her connection to nature alerts her that something is wrong, and her father informs her he has entered her into the Worldwide Fighting Tournament due to his belief the person responsible is associated with the event. After the tournament she reflects on her travels, having made friends with other fighters such as the boxer Dudley and Japanese warrior Akuma, and decides to continue traveling to make more friends with her next destination being Japan. Originally voiced by Kaoru Fujino, Mie Midori took over voice-acting duties with the release of &quot;Third Strike&quot;. Her later appearances were voiced by Saki Fujita and Karen Dyer in Japanese and English respectively.

Elena also appears as a downloadable character for &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, in which she convinces Dudley to travel with her and investigate the anomaly at the South Pole known as Pandora. Outside of fighting games, she is an available character in Capcom&#x27;s mobile game &quot;Street Fighter Battle Combination&quot; as well as in TOPJOY&#x27;s mobile roleplaying game &quot;Street Fighter: Duel&quot;, the latter of which features alternate &quot;Student&quot; and &quot;Summer&quot; versions exclusive to the Chinese version. The game &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; features her as an available card as does its Nintendo DS counterpart, as does GungHo Online Entertainment&#x27;s mobile game &quot;TEPPEN&quot;. In physical trading card game media she appears on cards for &quot;Versus TCG&quot;, a game based on &quot;Card Fighters Clash&quot;, and Jasco Games&#x27; &quot;Universal Fighting System&quot;.

All of Elena&#x27;s attacks in her fighting game appearances are leg-based, with no punches on even her throws and basic attacks. Due to her longer limbs, she has a higher range than most fighters, while her stance puts her lower to the ground than most taller characters. In addition, she is one of the only characters with the ability to heal via a Super Attack, aptly named Healing, which if uninterrupted will restore a good amount of her health. While in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; using this move was a tactical choice as she could only select one super attack for the entirety of the fight, in &quot;Ultra Street Fighter IV&quot;, it was now available alongside more traditional super attacks, giving her both offensive and defensive options. As a result, she has been described as one of the best characters for beginners to use.

===In other media===
Elena plays a minor role in the first volume of the &quot;Street Fighter III: Ryu Final&quot; manga by Masahiko Nakahira. In it, she observes the fight between protagonist Ryu and Dudley through her connection to nature and helps him overcome the boxer, much to Dudley&#x27;s delight. In the book &quot;Street Fighter: The Novel&quot; written by Takashi Yanodrawn, she appears in the second chapter and encounters interpol agent Chun-Li, who seeks information to help her take down the criminal organization Shadaloo. Elena offers to fight her for the information, and after losing agrees to help her against the organization. She also briefly appears in issue 74.5 of the manga series &quot;Kengan Ashura&quot;, as one of the fighters representing the &quot;Capcom Association&quot; present to watch Ryu fight the protagonist Ohma Tokita. The event is later suggested to be a dream that Ohma had.

She also appears throughout UDON Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comic series. Introduced in &quot;Street Fighter Legends: Ibuki&quot;″s second issue as a new student at a school, she meets the tomboy Makoto and teen ninja Ibuki, helping the latter train and fight off a rival ninja clan during the series. In &quot;Street Fighter Unlimited&quot;, the girls are invited to self-proclaimed god Gill&#x27;s fighting tournament, where she incites an impromptu dance party before said tournament and encounters the troubled mutant Necro, convincing him and his girlfriend to join their party to ease his mind. After Gill reveals himself to be a villain, she fights alongside the other participants to take him down. In the followup crossover series &quot;Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers&quot;, she fights alongside &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; series character Victor and the other heroes against an impending apocalypse, and helps heal his comatose sister. In later comics, she appears in &quot;Street Fighter: Hyper Looting&quot;, a promotional comic for the company Loot Crate, and in &quot;Street Fighter: Back to School Special&quot;, in which after wrestling with Makoto they ponder what college to attend.

==Promotion and reception==
To promote the character and games, Capcom released a wide variety of stationary figures and garage kits of the character in a variety of poses. These come from manufacturers including G-Dome, Mad Hands, Yujin, and Kotabukiya, and while most were based on her primary appearance, several were released with alternate versions based on character-select color options in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;. In addition, her current English voice actress Karen Dyer has cosplayed the character multiple times to promote herself.

Elena has been mostly well-received by video game critics and writers. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; described her &quot;wearing almost nothing and acrobatically showing off her crotch at every opportunity&quot; and the smoothness of her animation in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, adding that she was more than just &quot;a bikini-clad tease with impossibly fluid and graceful movements&quot;. &quot;Planet Xbox 360&quot; shared the sentiment, stating that her presence brings &quot;a lot of depth to character roster that truly needs more women representation&quot;, and further praising her beauty by noting &quot;if guys drool over Cammy’s legs, then Elena should make them blush in the company of other women.&quot; &quot;Paste&quot; praised Elena as &quot;a great character from a design standpoint&quot;, though were critical of how her gameplay transitioned from &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; to &quot;IV&quot;. Regardless they described her fighting style as elegant, and added that &quot;Elena is still one of the series&#x27; strongest ideas.&quot;

However, &quot;Edge&quot; magazine criticized her fighting style, stating that it &quot;made her feel more like a &quot;Tekken&quot; character than one drawn from Capcom&#x27;s asset library.&quot; Amanda LaPergola of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; stated mixed feelings about the character, praising her appearance in combat and describing her as a &quot;unique fighter with a lot of flare and style&quot;. On the other hand, she cared little for personality, specifically noting &quot;she fights in a bikini, and looks and acts like Storm’s annoying younger sister&quot; while also calling out her &quot;&#x27;but I just want to be a normal girl!&#x27; storyline&quot; as a common trope she disliked amongst female &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters. However, she acknowledged the character was making an effort, &quot;so you can’t hate on her that much.&quot; Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; added that &quot;Elena’s design never caught on with me,&quot; further elaborating that her storyline purpose of wanting to make friends was &quot;lame&quot; in his view, though admitted that he changed his mind upon seeing her &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; ending and the extent of which she was able to befriend other characters, namely the normally fierce Akuma.

Funké Joseph of &quot;IGN&quot; praised her as the &quot;first playable Black woman in the series, and, at the time, one of the only Black women in video games at all&quot; in regards to her appearance in the first &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, and gave further praise to her use of capoeira, adding it &quot;offers a sense fluidity and finesse that other characters don’t possess.&quot; However, some like Amanda LaPergola in the aforementioned &quot;Mary Sue&quot; article drew issue with her design, her specifically noting that while other characters in the series were exaggerated stereotypes, &quot;it seems like the default mode for “character from Africa&#x27; is always &#x27;a tribal princess who wears no clothes.&quot; Author Nnedi Okorafor cited her &quot;light skin, blue eyes and white hair&quot; and &quot;European features&quot; as an example of how a character&#x27;s ethnicity did not always match their appearance, and discussed her further regarding the lack of actual dark-skinned and African women in gaming, asking &quot;Could it be that game makers felt that beauty existed only in those of &#x27;fair&#x27; skin, straight hair, and small noses?&quot;

While Jean-Karlo Lemus of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; acknowledged there was some criticism towards her design, particularly in regards to how she seemed to conform to European standards of beauty, he nonetheless described her as one of the most influential women in Capcom&#x27;s history due to her role as the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise&#x27;s first black female character and saw her as a fan favorite. However, he shared fan response in regards to her portrayal in the mobile game &quot;Street Fighter Duel&quot;, where she was often depicted with a lighter skintone to the extent of appearing whitewashed. Lemus felt this was particularly reflected in the &quot;Trendy Elena&quot; portrayal of the character in the game, which is based on Japanese gyaru fashion. While he felt her already dark skin tone and presence in Japan made the style appropriate for her, its implementation was another matter as it was more blatantly whitewashed in his eyes. While he emphasized that lighting was often a factor in how darker skintones were portrayed in media, in the case of &quot;Duel&quot; her appearance deviated too far from her original design to the point she seemed to be a different character entirely, and received an almost universal negative reaction from fans of the character and left himself feeling disappointed with Capcom.

<text>Elena ( ) is a Bulgarian town in the central Stara Planina mountain in Veliko Tarnovo Province, located 42 km (26 miles) southeast of Veliko Tarnovo. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Elena Municipality. The area is also a mountain resort, known for the typical local cuisine. As of December 2009, the town had a population of 5,665. It forms a terminal for the Gorna Oryahovitsa-Elena railway line.

== History and architecture ==
Elena is an old settlement founded before the 15th century. During the 18th and 19th century it established itself as a centre for crafts, trade and education. There are several architectural ensembles preserved dating back to the Bulgarian National Revival and comprising about 130 old houses. There are also wall-to-wall construction forms and interesting street silhouettes. The houses have stone basements with white-washed or wooden walls of the upper floor with protruding bays above.

The town&#x27;s sights include an old first class school, founded in 1848 and named &quot;Daskalolivnitsa&quot;, where future teachers were educated (and where nowadays a museum exhibition is arranged). The St Nicholas Church of the 16th century, with valuable mural paintings and icons, and the three-naved Church of the Assumption, built entirely of stone (1837). The clock tower (Chasovnikova kula) that features an antique clock mechanism (1812) rises at the town&#x27;s highest point.

== Legend about Elena&#x27;s founding ==

There are many legends about the establishment of the town of Elena, the most common is about two lovers. The legend says that in the virgin forests of the Balkan Mountains was a pathway. A happy newly married couple was passing through this way. The bride was called Elena – from the village of , and the groom was Samuil from Tvarditsa. Bandits attacked the wedding ceremony at the place where the town of Elena is situated today. Elena fought with the abductors and they killed her near the Bridge of the Turkish Police office. She was interred in a grave in the area called &quot;The Cross&quot; that was later made into a churchyard. Samuil was beheaded at the end of the present town now known as . Because of the sorrow towards their son, Samuil&#x27;s parents settled down in this region and established the village that was named after Elena.

== Geography ==

The town of Elena is situated in the skirts of the woody Elena Balkan range, in the valley of Elena river. On the north are situated Elena’s Hills, and on the south is the Balkan range.

== History ==

Since 1430, the town has been known as Stramena and Eliana. It used to be a craft, trade and culture centre in 18th and 19th century. The town itself and its citizens both had roles in the Bulgarian Revival. The people of Elena had taken part in several important events from that moment on – for example, Velcho&#x27;s Conspiracy (in 1835) and Tarnovo rebellion in 1862.

The town of Elena is known as the “Bulgarian Bethlehem” because there were three churches in the town during the Revival. At that time this was something unseen in any other town.

The most sacred place in Elena is the old church “Saint Nikola”. There is data about its existence even before the 16th century. In the old psalter – saved by Doino Gramatik, it is mentioned that “This book is being given to the church “St. Nikola” in 1518 by a Pera”. The church already was a book store-house as well in those ages – a bridge between Elena and the Tarnovo Literary School. It is said that this church had many ancient parchment hand-written books. They were maintained by a special priest who had lent them out to others. The temple “St. Nikola” was the only one for all the villages around Elena. The villagers used to conduct their religious rituals in the local little village churchyards. They prayed for rain and rich harvests under century-old oak-trees. They organised liturgies in the days of their saints – St. Archangel, St. Nikola, and St. Ilia. The oldest man burned incense over the common table with incense on a broken roof-tile instead of an incense-burner. The villagers came to Elena to the church “St. Nikola” on Sundays. The church days became market days as well. Thus, later on, they started organising fairs that lasted three days and took place three times a year.

On April 23, 1800 – the day of St. Georgi, when Elena was attacked by Muslim tribes (kardzhalii), the church “St. Nikola” was burned down together with most of the books. Without the permission of the Turkish authorities, the people of Elena started restoring the church. They rebuilt the church in secret for 40 days and nights. They had to dig the church into the ground in order not to tease the enslavers. It was restored back to the way it looked, in 1804, with the funds donated by the rich people and the labour of the poor.

The rebuilding was managed by Hadji Ivan Kisiov – grandson of Pope Petko Sheytana, who attended the Sultan’s mother in Tzarigrad in a hat with a wheat-ear and persuaded her that the people of Elena should be relieved of their obligation to pay tax on growing of their wheat. Having heard that the trade governor of the region would order an examination whether the people of Elena were building a church illegally, Hadji Ivan Kisiov had the outer walls of the church grouted with lime and charcoal solution one night. Thus the walls looked old and smoke-black. Hadji Ivan kindly welcomed the examiners, gave them 30 golden coins, showed them the building and told them: “Greet the governor for me and tell him that the people of Elena don’t build a church but reconstruct an old threshing-floor”.

The church looks like a stronghold from outside. Its walls are made of stone and are 1-meter thick; the little windows have iron gratings, and the altar is like an embrasure. The door was made of thick oak boards studded with iron, with a unique heavy lock mechanism. It is roofed in with heavy stone slates. The church was consecrated on the Annunciation – March 25, 1805. A stone plate built in on the left of the altar says that the church was rebuilt from its foundations after it was burned down by agrarian bandits. The biggest loss was that of the burned historic parchment manuscripts from the literary treasury.

Pope Doino Gramatik had mentioned the names of 12 church-donors, one of whom was Stoyan Mihaylovski – the father of Ilarion Makareopolski. Today there is a collection of 340 old books in the book store-house.

The church “St. Nikola” was decorated completely by the famous Elena icon-painters of those ages – David and Yyakov who were born in Bolertsi. They finished their work in 1817–1818. The wall-paintings are incredibly precious and were announced to be cultural monuments of national importance. Here are the icon of the saints Metodiy of Morav, Georgi Novi of Sofia, Sava of Serbia, and the icon of Kliment of Ohrid – whose icon is a very rare one both in Bulgaria and Macedonia, and that is why it is one of high artistic value. Highly valued are also the wooden iconostasis and the bishop&#x27;s stall.

A new chapel &quot;The Assu of Holy Virgin&quot; was built in 1800 with the permission of Rousse-Tarnovo governor Smail Aga. This chapel was remade into a steadier building in 1813. As the time passed, the wooden building ceased satisfying the needs of the town. The people of Elena decided to build a bigger church. They thought of demolishing the fortified wall “Kaleto” and using its stone materials. They decided to do so in order to prevent the fortress being settled by Turkish garrisons. The building of this church was the work of master Miho from Bolertsi – a hamlet near Elena. The whole building with its solid construction and the materials, the artistic execution of the details and especially the interior showed the increased self-confidence of the citizens, and the constructive mastery and courage of master Miho. He was a contemporary of Kolio Fitcheto, master Gencho Kanev, and he did not step back to their creativity, design and realisation. The construction was started in 1836, and finished in 1837, and the church was consecrated on August, 28.

In 1861 when the church was repaired, a notice stating this was left on the western wall above the cornice. The bell tower is a separate building which was built in 1912. In 1925 the church “The Assu of Holy Virgin” lost an incredibly precious artistic creation – in a fire the iconostasis was burned down. The new iconostasis was carved by Gorgi Kirov, and the icons were created by the artist Hristo Berberov from Elena.

The third relic – the temple “The Birth of Holy Virgin” has had a fortune similar to the one of the old church “St. Nikola” and has been bounded with the historical development of the town. In 1812 a chapel was built under the direction of Hadji Yordan Bradata on a site given as a present by Hadji Panayot and Hadji Dimitar Razsukanov. It was reported in Tarnovo that a church was built again in secret and without the sultan’s decree. Hadji Yordan Bradata disguised the building before the examination (as Hadji Ivan Kisiov did few years ago); he ordered cribs to be put and horses to be tied up in the temple in order to make it look like stables. The temple together with the near-built cells were primary used as a convent for young girls. A legend says that Hadji Yordan Bradata’s wife, after his hanging, entered this same convent as a nun. Conspirators from the Velcho’s Conspiracy swore at the icon of Hadji Yordan Bradata (that was brought from the Holy Sepulchre) in the temple of Plakovci monastery “St. Ilia”. On July 20, 1859 the wooden walls of the chapel “The Birth of Holy Virgin” could not survive the fair that flamed out. They started the building of a new church and finished it in 1865. It was built by the young master Kolio Petkov from Tyavna – a student of Kolio Fitcheto. During the next year in the two newly built rooms next to the chapel, a school for young girls was established. The school functioned till 1894.

On November 22, 1877 in one of the bloody battles from the Russian-Turkish war, the Battle of Elena, when the town was set on fire, the enslavers destroyed the iconostasis and made a corn-store out of the church.

The icon called “The Bulgarian Teachers” portraying the saints equal to Apostles and Slavic-Bulgarian Teachers Cyril and Methodius was a precious relic from the church. It was painted by Stanislav Dospevski at the people of Elena’s request in 1866. The icon stayed in the church for 15 years and afterwards was given as a present to the public school and now it is being preserved in the cultural-historic complex “Daskalolivnitsata” (meaning “the place that “produces” teachers”). The icon has deep symbolic content. The saint brothers are having the Sacrament cup in their hands and with the gospel call they say: “The power is in the speech”. This is the Sacrament for the Bulgarian people. Above the saint brothers’ heads is shining the sun shining with ten rays – symbolising science.

In 1966 the temple was constructively strengthened. During the restoration of the wall-paintings of the church above the north door was found an in-built stone slide with a beautiful embossed icon of the church’s patron saint – Saint Nikola. In the autumn of 1987 the church was completely restored and exposed to visits.

== Kaleto ==

It is situated on a hill above Elena. In the ages of kardzhalii there was a huge stone stronghold. In its highest part there was a guard who kept a sharp eye on potential approaching of kirdzhalis. If he had noticed them coming, he would have given an alarm, and all the churches had started ringing their church-bells. This served as a signal for the people of Elena to head for Kaleto as fast as possible in order to find protection against the bandits. After the kardzhalii’s crime activities were over, the fortress Kaleto was used as Turkish Army barracks, but it started demolishing. In 1836, when the church “The Assu of Holy Virgin” was built, there were used materials from the demolished stronghold Kaleto to build the church.

== Others ==
==Gallery==
== Cuisine ==

* &quot;Elenski but&quot; - Elena pork leg
* Fillet “Elena” (ribitsa)
* Elena plum rakia (brandy): Unlike the grape-rich southern sides of the Middle Balkan range, its northern sides (up to 20–25 km; 15 miles away from the mountains ridge) are known by the better conditions for fruit-growing rather than grape-growing. This has led to specific traditions of producing spirit beverages for the last 200–300 years. Although the richest local landowners – who possessed lands in remote from the Balkan areas – could have afforded producing wine on their own, it was set as a tradition for the locals that they would produce plum rakia (brandi).

==Honour==
Elena Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Elena.

<text>Dan-Air (legally &quot;Dan Air Services Limited&quot;) was an airline based in the United Kingdom and a wholly owned subsidiary of London-based shipbroking firm Davies and Newman. It was started in 1953 with a single aircraft. Initially, it operated cargo and passenger charter flights from Southend (1953–1955) and Blackbushe airports (1955–1960) using a variety of piston-engined aircraft before moving to a new base at Gatwick Airport in 1960, followed by expansion into inclusive tour (IT) charter flights and all-year round scheduled services. The introduction of two de Havilland Comet series 4 jet aircraft in 1966 made Dan-Air the second British independent airline after British United Airways to begin sustained jet operations.

The early 1970s saw the acquisition of a pair of Boeing 707 long-haul jets for use on affinity group and Advance Booking Charter flights to Canada and the United States. In 1973, Dan-Air became the first British airline to operate the Boeing 727 trijet. By the mid-1970s, it had become Britain&#x27;s largest independent airline, both in terms of passengers carried and fleet size, operating the country&#x27;s largest charter fleet. This was also the time a Dan-Air staff member, Yvonne Pope Sintes became Britain&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s first female jet captain.

By the early 1980s, the airline had also become the leading operator of fixed wing oil industry support flights, operating a fleet of 13 Hawker Siddeley 748 turboprops between bases on the Scottish mainland and the Shetland Islands under contract to firms involved in North Sea oil exploration.
In 1983, Dan-Air was the first airline to launch commercial operations with British Aerospace 146 regional jet. The acquisition of an Airbus A300 in 1986 marked Dan-Air&#x27;s widebody debut and the late 1980s saw a major expansion of their scheduled activities, including the introduction of two-class services on trunk routes. Passenger numbers peaked in 1989 at 6.2 million (1.8 million on scheduled services).

Lack of vertical integration with a tour operator, and an inefficient fleet mix dominated by ageing Boeing 727s and BAC One-Elevens made Dan-Air uncompetitive, resulting in increasing marginalisation and growing financial difficulties as well as a change in senior management and strategy by the early 1990s. Following unsuccessful attempts to merge Dan-Air with a competitor, the ailing airline was sold to British Airways in 1992 for the nominal sum of £1.

==History==
===Beginning===

Dan-Air&#x27;s parent Davies and Newman had been engaged in shipbroking in the City of London since 1922. It subsequently diversified into air charter broking from an office at London&#x27;s Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange. Amongst Davies and Newman&#x27;s clients for whom it acted as an air charter broker was a small airline called Meredith Air Transport. Meredith was formed in 1952 as a small &quot;ad hoc&quot; charter operator and flew a single Douglas DC-3 out of Southend Airport, where it also had its head office. When Meredith&#x27;s only aircraft suffered a mishap while taking off from Jerusalem&#x27;s Atarot Airport on Christmas Eve 1952 that damaged the aircraft&#x27;s tailwheel, this caused major disruption to the company&#x27;s business. As a result, Meredith soon found itself in financial difficulties. Davies and Newman agreed to take a debenture on Meredith&#x27;s aircraft in return for extending financial assistance. When Meredith&#x27;s financial problems worsened and the debenture became due for repayment, Davies &amp; Newman took over the aircraft together with a six-month contract to operate a series of charter flights between Southend and West Berlin&#x27;s Tempelhof Airport that formed part of the second &quot;Little Berlin Airlift&quot;.

Dan-Air began commercial air services in the UK in May 1953 with the aircraft it had taken over from Meredith Air Transport, a single Douglas DC-3 bearing the registration G-AMSU. The fledgling airline received its air operator&#x27;s certificate on 23 May 1953.

Dan-Air derived its name from its parent&#x27;s initials, Davies, And, Newman. The company was incorporated on 21 May 1953 as Dan Air Services Limited, with a capital of £5,000. To emphasise that this was a British rather than a Danish company, the airline&#x27;s aircraft displayed the suffix &quot;London&quot; with the Dan-Air name on both sides of the fuselage. This convention was followed until a year before Dan-Air&#x27;s takeover by British Airways, when the &quot;London&quot; suffix was dropped from fuselage titles.

Dan-Air&#x27;s first commercial service – an &quot;ad hoc&quot; charter flight from Southend via Manchester to Shannon – occurred in June 1953. Operations initially continued from Meredith&#x27;s old base at Southend Airport, where Meredith managed Dan-Air&#x27;s operations for the first six months. (Following the end of Meredith&#x27;s contract to manage Dan-Air&#x27;s operations at Southend, Meredith Air Transport changed its name to African Air Safaris on 29 November 1954.)

===Areas of commercial activity===
Dan-Air operated inclusive tour (IT) charter flights, regional short-haul scheduled services, transatlantic and other worldwide affinity group/Advanced Booking Charters (ABC flights), oil industry support flights and &quot;ad hoc&quot; operations including all-cargo services from London Gatwick, other British airports and Tegel Airport in West Berlin.

===Commercial success===

Dan-Air&#x27;s acquisition of three ex-RAF Transport Command Avro Yorks in 1954 resulted in establishment of Dan-Air Engineering as a sister company at Lasham, a disused war-time airfield in Hampshire, to service its fleet as well as other operators.

The acquisition of a second DC-3 in 1954 resulted in Dan-Air moving its main operating base from Southend to Blackbushe the following year. The main base transferred to Gatwick in 1960 when Blackbushe closed to commercial airlines.

Dan-Air&#x27;s arrival at Gatwick in 1960 coincided with the entry into service of three former Butler Air Transport Airspeed Ambassadors, the airline&#x27;s first pressurised aircraft. This heralded the beginning of a major expansion into the IT charter market, including its first charter programme from Manchester. Horizon Holidays was one of the first tour operators to contract the airline&#x27;s aircraft. The Ambassador fleet numbered seven aircraft by the mid-1960s and operated the majority of the company&#x27;s IT flights until Comets and One-Elevens assumed the bulk of these operations towards the end of the decade.

In 1966, Dan-Air introduced its first pair of ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) de Havilland Comet series 4 aircraft, which made it the second British independent airline after British United Airways to start uninterrupted pure jet operations. This marked the beginning of sustained, steady and mostly profitable expansion.

By the end of the 1960s, Dan-Air had become Gatwick&#x27;s third biggest resident operator after British United Airways and Caledonian Airways.

In October 1970, the US Civil Aeronautics Board granted Dan-Air a foreign carrier permit for a five-year period. This became effective on 5 April 1971 and enabled the airline to operate regular transatlantic affinity group charter flights between Britain and the US. To assist with marketing its transatlantic capacity to affinity group charter organisers in both countries, Dan-Air established a new joint venture named Dan-Air Intercontinental in partnership with CPS Aviation Services as a jointly owned subsidiary. Flights began in late-March 1971 with a Boeing 707-321 that was acquired second-hand from Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). The successful launch of Dan-Air&#x27;s transatlantic joint venture led to the acquisition of a second 707-321 from Pan Am in 1972, and both aircraft continued to be primarily employed on transatlantic charter flights between Britain, Canada and the US until their retirement in 1978.

Dan-Air&#x27;s parent, Davies and Newman Holdings, became a publicly listed company when it was floated on the London Stock Exchange in late 1971. The group was capitalised at £5 million at its stock market debut. This provided the funds to expand its charter business, build a network of regional scheduled services between secondary airports across Europe (with particular emphasis on the United Kingdom and Ireland), enter the transatlantic affinity group/ABC market and establish itself as leading fixed wing operator of oil industry support flights. It let the airline expand its fleet, leading to introduction of the One-Eleven, Boeing 707, Hawker Siddeley 748, Boeing 727,Boeing 737, BAe 146 and, eventually, the Airbus A300.
Most were acquired second-hand.

In 1972, Dan-Air co-founded Gatwick Handling, a Gatwick-based handling agent, with Laker Airways. Each owned 50% at its inception.

By the mid-1970s, Dan-Air had become the second biggest resident operator at Gatwick after British Caledonian. From then on, it operated the largest of the UK independent airlines&#x27; fleets as well as Britain&#x27;s largest charter fleet. Operating a large fleet comprising aircraft of various sizes gave the airline unrivalled flexibility among European charter carriers to meet the requirements of different tour operators. In the UK, Dan-Air was second only to British Airways in fleet size. For most of this period, Dan-Air had more than 50 aircraft, employed about 3,000 and by the end of the 1980s carried 6 million passengers annually, almost one-third on scheduled services.

Dan-Air marked the 1980s with a corporate makeover. The first stage entailed a new fleet-wide livery. One Boeing 727-100, the airline&#x27;s first pair of stretched Boeing 727-200 Advanced and its first Boeing 737 were first to appear in the new livery. The second stage gave the fleet widebody look interiors as each aircraft underwent maintenance. The final stage changed stationery, ticket wallets, timetable covers, airport signs and baggage tags as well as its logo in advertisements and public relations campaigns.

By the time British Airways took over British Caledonian, Dan-Air had become Gatwick&#x27;s second-largest slot holder, accounting for 16% of slots. Dan-Air provided the chairman of the Gatwick Scheduling Committee while British Caledonian, Gatwick&#x27;s largest slot holder, provided the [slot] co-ordinator.

====Expansion overseas====
Dan-Air&#x27;s first overseas expansion occurred during the Cold War in 1968 when Frank Tapling, the sales director, visited German tour operators to increase utilisation of the growing Comet fleet and take advantage of the fact that all airlines other than those headquartered in the US, the UK and France were banned from West Berlin. Operating out of West Berlin let Dan-Air redeploy capacity left surplus in the UK due to sterling&#x27;s devaluation and exchange controls which limited passengers to £50 a trip, and to obtain better rates than in the oversupplied UK charter market. The Comets&#x27; low acquisition costs also enabled Dan-Air to offer German tour operators with flying programmes from West Berlin keener rates than other Allied charter carriers – chiefly, fellow British independent Laker Airways and US airline Modern Air.

31 March 1968 marked the beginning of Dan-Air&#x27;s association with Tegel which lasted 25 years. On that day, a Comet 4 left the airport for Málaga, the first of almost 300 IT flights under contract to West German tour operator Neckermann und Reisen. Dan-Air established its first overseas base at Tegel in 1969. Up to five aircraft were stationed there for over two decades. These initially comprised Comets, One-Elevens, Boeing 707s and 727s. They were later replaced with Boeing 737s, Hawker Siddeley 748s and BAe 146s. The Berlin fleet operated charters under contract to tour operators as well as scheduled services to Amsterdam and Saarbrücken. Gatwick aircraft and crew operated most regular charter flights as well as all scheduled services linking Berlin with Gatwick. At its peak during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Berlin was staffed by 170, mainly local, employees and handled more than 300,000 passengers annually.

Dan-Air&#x27;s Berlin 727s had additional fuselage fuel tanks to fly non-stop to the Canary Islands with a full payload. At the distance between Berlin and Las Palmas was greater than the shortest transatlantic crossing between Shannon in western Ireland and Gander in eastern Canada. The five-hour flight was the limit of the 727&#x27;s economically viable non-stop range. The Berlin 727-100s&#x27; enhanced fuel capacity also meant that these aircraft had up to 20 fewer seats compared with their UK counterparts – 131 vs. 151 – to take full advantage of the resulting range increase. This in turn permitted Dan-Air to offer its German charter passengers an improved seat pitch, in line with German tour operators&#x27; requirement for a more comfortable seating arrangement as opposed to the then prevailing &quot;high-density&quot; configurations on most UK charter aircraft.

Dan-Air operated the first commercial flight to Tegel&#x27;s new terminal building on 1 November 1974 at 6am with a One-Eleven inbound from Tenerife.

====Scheduled service developments====
Dan-Air operated its first seasonal scheduled service during summer 1956 between Blackbushe and Jersey. It operated its first year-round scheduled service in 1960, linking Bristol and Cardiff with Liverpool. That service was inaugurated with a pair of de Havilland Doves. Subsequent changes included extending the service from Bristol to Plymouth, and replacing Doves with larger Herons and DC-3s. The resulting route pattern became the foundation of the &quot;Link City&quot; network. This linked South West England with the Northeast via stops at the commercial centres of the Midlands and the Northwest. DC-3s continued plying all domestic &quot;Link City&quot; scheduled routes for the first ten years.

The first international scheduled route was launched in 1960, linking Bristol and Cardiff with Basel. Further international scheduled services from Liverpool to Rotterdam, Bristol to Basel via Bournemouth as well as from Bristol and Gatwick to Ostend followed during the early 1960s. These were operated with DC-3s and Airspeed Ambassadors.

Dan-Air&#x27;s acquisition of Scottish Airlines and Skyways International in 1961 and 1972 enlarged the scheduled operation. The former brought a passenger-configured DC-3 and a seasonal route linking Prestwick with the Isle of Man. The latter resulted in four additional HS 748s and year-round services linking Bournemouth with Jersey and Guernsey, as well as seasonal flights linking Gatwick with Clermont-Ferrand and Montpellier. These aircraft let the airline expand &quot;Link City&quot; by adding Bournemouth and reorganising the structure by introducing Bournemouth–Birmingham–Liverpool/Manchester–Newcastle and Luton–Leeds Bradford–Glasgow, in April 1972. Schedules offered same-day-returns Monday to Friday. These ex-Skyways HS 748s enabled Dan-Air to open a seasonal Gatwick–Bern route in June 1972, the first direct scheduled air link between the UK and the Swiss capital. The acquisition resulted in the HS 748 becoming the main scheduled aircraft for the next ten years. As a consequence, 748s replaced the Nord 262 Dan-Air had acquired from Air Ceylon in 1970 as a DC-3 replacement to operate Bristol–Cardiff–Liverpool–Newcastle. In addition, Skyways brought a scheduled route linking Ashford (Lympne) Airport in Kent with Beauvais. This formed part of a London–Paris coach-air service, which Skyways had pioneered in 1955 with DC-3s. Dan-Air continued this service until the early 1980s. When Ashford closed in 1974, services moved to Lydd. Seven-four-eights, One-Elevens and Vickers Viscounts leased from other operators operated these services.

In 1973, Dan-Air added Teesside as a stop to &quot;Link City&quot; and inaugurated scheduled services between Teesside and Amsterdam.

In 1974, Dan-Air began replacing the 748 with Comets and One-Elevens on its seasonal, scheduled services between Gatwick, Clermont-Ferrand and Montpellier, as well as on its year-round Luton–Leeds–Glasgow schedule, the first time the airline had used jets on scheduled services. The turboprop capacity released enabled re-introduction of scheduled services between Bristol, Cardiff and Amsterdam, as well as the launch of direct scheduled services between Newcastle and the Isle of Man. During April that year, Dan-Air launched a year-round, same-day-return Gatwick–Newcastle jet schedule, the airline&#x27;s first UK mainland domestic feeder route from Gatwick. This twice-daily service, promoted with British Caledonian, initially utilised Comet 4Bs. From November 1974, BAC One-Eleven 300/400s replaced Comets on one of the rotations. In May 1974, Dan-Air launched a twice-daily Gatwick–Ostend HS 748 service in conjunction with Sabena. One of the two daily round-trips was operated under Sabena flight numbers.

In 1975, Dan-Air commenced a year-round scheduled service between Newcastle and Bergen, as well as two new, seasonal scheduled routes linking the Isle of Man with Aberdeen and Gatwick. The latter was the first non-stop scheduled air service between Gatwick and the Isle of Man. Nineteen-seventy-five was also the year the airline converted its seasonal Gatwick–Bern scheduled service into a year-round operation. During that year, the company extended its seasonal scheduled service between Gatwick and Clermont-Ferrand to Perpignan, and introduced One-Eleven jets on its seasonal, Gatwick–Jersey schedule. Nineteen seventy-five furthermore saw the acquisition of two former Zambia Airways One-Eleven 200s, the first time the firm had acquired jets to be exclusively operated on scheduled services. One aircraft was based at Gatwick, the other at Newcastle. Moreover, 1975 was the year Manchester became the sole stop in the Northwest on &quot;Link City&quot;.

In 1976 Dan-Air commenced a year-round scheduled service between Newcastle and Stavanger.
In 1977, Dan-Air launched a scheduled route from Gatwick to Strasbourg.
1978, Dan-Air&#x27;s silver jubilee, saw the launch of a scheduled service linking Gatwick with Bergen.

In November 1979, Dan-Air replaced British Airways as scheduled carrier between Gatwick and Aberdeen, a feeder route for the oil industry. 1979 also saw the launch of a Gatwick–Toulouse scheduled service.

In April 1980, Dan-Air took over British Airways&#x27;s loss-making regional services from Bristol, Cardiff and Newcastle to Belfast and Dublin, as well as from Bristol and Cardiff to Jersey, Guernsey and Paris Charles de Gaulle, and from Leeds/Bradford to Guernsey.

1981 saw Dan-Air launch a scheduled route linking Gatwick with Cork, its first scheduled service from Gatwick to Ireland, as well as a new, seasonal scheduled service linking Newcastle with Jersey and a new, year-round combined Gatwick–Newcastle–Aberdeen weekend schedule. During that year, the airline inaugurated scheduled services between Berlin and Amsterdam Schiphol, the company&#x27;s first scheduled route from Berlin as well as its first scheduled route not to touch the UK. Furthermore, in November, Dan-Air withdrew its application to the CAA to take over British Airways&#x27;s Highland and Islands scheduled operation.

During 1981 and 1982, Dan-Air leased three HS 748s to British Airways to supplement the latter&#x27;s 748 fleet on Scottish internal routes.

The partial liberalisation of the Anglo-Irish bilateral agreement during the early 1980s enabled Dan-Air to commence scheduled operations on Gatwick–Dublin in 1982. As the recession began to bite and passengers for &quot;Link City&quot; dwindled, the company contracted them to regional airlines operating smaller aircraft. Nineteen eighty-two saw Metropolitan Airways, a subsidiary of Alderney Air Ferries (Holdings), take over Dan-Air&#x27;s Bournemouth–Cardiff/Birmingham–Manchester–Newcastle schedule.

In March 1983, Dan-Air took over British Airways&#x27;s loss-making Heathrow–Inverness route. This was the first time the airline had operated a scheduled service out of Heathrow. In May 1983, the company flew the world&#x27;s inaugural BAe 146 scheduled service between Gatwick and Bern, the first commercial jet service into the small airport serving the Swiss capital. The same year, the company started scheduled Gatwick–Zürich flights, the second time it had launched daily scheduled services on a European trunk route. In November 1983, Dan-Air joined Travicom, the computer reservation system (CRS) used at the time by travel agents in the UK.

In January 1984, Dan-Air took over Touraine Air Transport&#x27;s scheduled internal German operation between Berlin and Saarbrücken, the first time the airline had operated a scheduled route entirely within another country. That year also saw Dan-Air assume British Midland&#x27;s scheduled route between Gatwick and Belfast International Airport as well as launch a scheduled Manchester–Zürich service. In May 1984, Dan-Air began stationing an aircraft in Jersey, increasing the frequency of its scheduled service to Gatwick and converting it into a year-round operation. In addition, 1984 was the year Metropolitan took over Dan-Air&#x27;s remaining &quot;Link City&quot; schedules between Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds and Glasgow.

In 1985, Dan-Air inaugurated a seasonal scheduled route linking Gatwick with Innsbruck, operated with a BAe 146. Innsbruck was the airline&#x27;s first scheduled destination in Austria, which began receiving commercial jetliners on a scheduled basis for the first time. Nineteen eighty-five was also the year Dan-Air launched a year-round Manchester–Newcastle–Oslo scheduled route, the company&#x27;s first scheduled services to the Norwegian capital.

In 1986, Dan-Air launched a year-round non-stop Manchester–Amsterdam scheduled service.

In 1987, Dan-Air began a scheduled service between Gatwick and Lisbon, its first scheduled service on a main trunk route between the UK and the Iberian peninsula. The same year, the airline joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a Trade Association member.

Following British Airways&#x27;s takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987, Dan-Air&#x27;s scheduled services transferred to Texas Air&#x27;s &quot;SystemOne&quot; CRS.

In 1988, Dan-Air commenced scheduled services between Gatwick and Madrid. Towards the end of that year, the airline also assumed the former British Caledonian routes from Gatwick to Paris Charles de Gaulle, Manchester, Aberdeen and Nice, gaining access to some of Gatwick&#x27;s most important feeder routes, as well as some of the densest and most lucrative short-haul European trunk routes.

At the start of the 1988–1989 winter timetable, Dan-Air became a two-class scheduled airline when, under the stewardship of Vic Sheppard, it introduced its &quot;Class Elite&quot; business class between Gatwick and Paris and between Gatwick and Nice on three refurbished One-Eleven 500s. Sheppard had joined Dan-Air from British Caledonian.

In 1989, Dan-Air introduced &quot;Class Elite&quot; on all scheduled flights from Gatwick to Dublin, Zürich, Lisbon, Madrid and Toulouse.

In 1990, Dan-Air introduced year-round two-class scheduled services from Gatwick to Tegel and Vienna. Gatwick–Tegel was Dan-Air&#x27;s first scheduled link between its main UK base and its long-established overseas base. At the start of the 1990–1991 winter timetable, the firm replaced one of the two Berlin HS 748 turboprops with larger BAe 146 jets on Berlin–Amsterdam and introduced direct scheduled services linking Berlin with Manchester and Newcastle via Amsterdam. In addition, the company took over the Gatwick–Amsterdam feeder route from British Airways.

Following Air Europe&#x27;s demise at the end of the first week of March 1991, Dan-Air began assuming most of the failed carrier&#x27;s scheduled routes from Gatwick, starting with Gatwick–Brussels and Gatwick–Oslo. Dan-Air&#x27;s rival&#x27;s collapse also enabled it to increase frequencies and introduce larger aircraft on the busy Gatwick – Charles de Gaulle and Gatwick–Manchester routes. At the start of the 1991–1992 winter timetable, Dan-Air increased the frequency of its Gatwick – Charles de Gaulle Airport services to nine return flights per day and Gatwick–Manchester to eight daily returns. The airline replaced BAC One-Eleven 500s with Boeing 737s on both routes. From then on, Dan-Air carried more scheduled passengers than British Caledonian had ever carried in one year throughout its existence.

The expansion of Dan-Air&#x27;s scheduled operation at Gatwick continued throughout 1992, resulting in the resumption of former Air Europe routes to Stockholm Arlanda in February and Rome Fiumicino in April. In addition, Dan-Air launched Gatwick–Athens in March and re-launched Gatwick–Barcelona in May. During that period, Dan-Air became Gatwick&#x27;s largest resident, short-haul scheduled operator controlling 18% of all slots, and 21% of all morning peak time slots between 8am and 9am.

In addition to scheduled services on its own account, Dan-Air was also contracted by other airlines to operate scheduled passenger and cargo services.

In 1959, British European Airways (BEA) awarded Dan-Air a two-year contract to operate its six-times weekly scheduled freight service between Heathrow, Manchester and Glasgow&#x27;s old Renfrew Airport using Avro York freighters. From 1960, BEA awarded Dan-Air additional contracts to operate its freight services from Heathrow to other destinations in the UK and Continental Europe. The airline eventually replaced the DC-3s, which it had used to operate these latter services, with Avro Yorks.

For a couple of months starting in October 1968, Kuwait Airways contracted its entire scheduled operation to Dan-Air, who supplied flight deck crews to man Comets while their own pilots underwent conversion training on the Boeing 707 in the US.

During the 1970s, IAS Cargo Airlines sub-contracted Dan-Air to operate Zambia Airways&#x27;s weekly scheduled Heathrow–Lusaka all-cargo service with a small fleet of 707 freighters in hybrid Dan-Air/IAS Cargo Airlines colours.

==== Milestones ====
Dan-Air claimed to be the first airline to transport a live dolphin. It also laid claim to be the first to introduce disposable catering equipment aboard its aircraft in 1969.

Dan-Air ordered its first new aircraft in 1969, a single Handley Page Jetstream to replace the DC-3 assigned to &quot;Link City&quot;. However, the order lapsed when Handley Page went into liquidation in 1970. Despite the negotiations being at an advanced stage, with the manufacturer&#x27;s future in doubt, it was difficult to finance the purchase and the order could not be completed.

Dan-Air ran its first transatlantic charter flight in October 1969 from Gatwick to Trinidad with a Comet.

Dan-Air operated a dozen 707 round-the-world charters for German tour operators during the mid-1970s.

Dan-Air was one of the first UK airlines to employ female pilots, with five among 550 during 1978. It was also the first UK airline to have a female pilot in command of jet aircraft. Yvonne Sintes, who had started her career as an airline pilot with Morton Air Services in 1965, joined Dan-Air as a Bristol-based DC-3 first officer in 1969. She gained her command as a captain on the HS 748 fleet before becoming a One-Eleven captain in 1975. Sintes flew One-Elevens and Comets until her retirement in 1980.

During its 39-year history, Dan-Air passed several important passenger number milestones.
In 1960, Dan-Air carried 100,000 passengers. It carried 500,000 passengers in one year for the first time in 1969. 1971 saw more than 1 million passengers. 1973 was the first year the company carried more than 2 million. 1977 was the first time with more than 3 million. Four million was reached the following year. It took until 1985 to reach 5 million. In 1989, over 6 million flew with Dan-Air, the highest number ever. 1984 was the year Dan-Air carried more than 1 million scheduled passengers for the first time. Between 1966 and 1980, Dan-Air&#x27;s 38-strong, active Comet fleet carried 8 million passengers.

===Financial issues===
1989 marked a watershed – it was the first year since the era prior to the decision to introduce jets in the mid-1960s, and the only time apart from a blip in 1981–1982, when the company lost money over a whole 12-month period. The loss of £3 million was in contrast to the profit of £10 million made the year before. Like most charter-focused operators, Dan-Air used to make a loss during the winter because of the seasonal nature of its business. However, this was compensated by the profit it made during the summer, giving a modest profit for the entire financial period. The financial position deteriorated during the early 1990s. It lost £35 million in 1991, its last complete 12-month period, and £24 million during the last six months of its existence until October 1992.

===Causes of decline===
Among the reasons for Dan-Air&#x27;s decline was the lack of vertical integration with a UK tour operator. Dan-Air was the last major independent provider of charter airline seats to numerous large, medium-sized and small tour companies in the UK and overseas, at a time when most UK tour firms had set up their own airlines. These then competed with Dan-Air for the bulk of those operators&#x27; business, leading to a decline in rates. This resulted in a decline in Dan-Air&#x27;s importance as a business partner for these tour operators, reducing its status from main to marginal provider.

Another reason was that its fleet contained too many different, incompatible aircraft types. Some of these aircraft were older and less efficient than those operated by competitors such as Air Europe. Consequently, the Dan-Air fleet was costlier to operate and maintain. The Boeing 727s, which Dan-Air continued to acquire throughout the 1980s, including some on unfavourable leases, proved a financial millstone.

Dan-Air&#x27;s decision to embark on a major expansion into scheduled services from Gatwick at a time when the UK economy was still mired in the early 1990s recession made the financial position worse. The economic conditions in the UK meant that actual revenues fell short of budget in Dan-Air&#x27;s 1991–1995 business plan, which aimed at sustained profitability by 1995 with a £42 million profit. This meant an injection of £49 million of additional working capital into Dan-Air&#x27;s parent company from a successful share issue in 1990 was insufficient to fund the airline&#x27;s needs. The funds raised through new shares were insufficient to standardise Dan-Air&#x27;s fleet on the Boeing 737 300/400 series and the Avro RJ115 (marketed but never built). The funds were also insufficient to finance transformation from a cheap-and-cheerful charter carrier with a motley collection of poorly performing, &quot;low visibility&quot; regional scheduled routes into a top quality, &quot;high visibility&quot; mainline short-haul scheduled operator plying trunk routes.

Dan-Air&#x27;s last chairman, David James, said weak marketing and its charter mentality, even after the decision to make high-profile scheduled services the focus of commercial activities, was a reason it failed to achieve results. That meant that instead of making Dan-Air the airline of choice for high-yield business travellers on prime scheduled routes where it had become a major force in the wake of the demise of British Caledonian and Air Europe – such as Gatwick to Paris Charles de Gaulle – through carefully targeted marketing and publicity, Dan-Air continued selling the bulk of its scheduled inventory to consolidators and discount travel agencies, in the way it had sold its charter inventory to package tour operators. The airline saw this as risk minimisation to fill seats on scheduled services. However, Dan-Air surrendered control over its scheduled seats to third parties whose sales were volume-driven. This deprived Dan-Air of the opportunity to boost the profitability of its scheduled operation by concentrating on maximising revenues from high-yield travellers.

===Sale to British Airways===
Following inconclusive talks with Virgin Atlantic to save Dan-Air in return for an investment of £10 million, the airline was sold to British Airways in 1992. British Airways paid a nominal £1, in return taking on financial commitments of £50 million which included debts of £37 million. For its part, British Airways got 12 of Dan-Air&#x27;s most modern Boeing 737s, a similar number of short-haul scheduled routes from Gatwick, the Heathrow–Inverness feeder service and about one-fifth of its 2,500 workers. Dan-Air was absorbed into British Airways&#x27; Gatwick operation.

On 27 November 1992, the company&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Dan Air Services Ltd&quot; to &quot;British Airways (European Operations at Gatwick) Ltd&quot;. This remnant of the former Dan-Air formed the nucleus of what British Airways intended to be a low-cost short-haul feeder for its Gatwick long-haul scheduled services, with the aim of helping to return British Airways&#x27; loss-making Gatwick operation to sustained profitability.

==Corporate affairs==

===Headquarters===
From 1953 to 1987, Dan-Air had its headquarters at the City of London in Bilbao House.
==Fleet==

It operated the world&#x27;s largest fleet of de Havilland Comets and was the last in the world to operate them. Dan-Air built a 49-strong Comet fleet between 1966 and 1976. It retired the last example in November 1980. Not all of these airframes saw actual airline service; some had been exclusively acquired for spares. The Comets commanded a lower price than comparable second-hand jets. They were relatively unused as many previous operators had replaced them with the larger and more economical Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 after only a few years. The airframes had many years of service left and cost a fraction of the similarly sized BAC One-Eleven 500 or Boeing 737-200, which were still scarce second-hand. It allowed the airline to replace most of its piston-engined airliners – such as the Avro York, the Bristol 170 Freighter and the Airspeed AS 57 Ambassador – which had reached or were nearing the end of their lives, relatively cheaply.

Dan-Air was the last commercial airline operator of the Ambassador. A small number of this high-winged, twin-engined plane survived in the fleet into the jet era. The last retired in September 1971 after its final Jersey–Gatwick scheduled service.

Dan-Air was the first British operator of the Boeing 727 trijet, at the time the world&#x27;s best-selling commercial jetliner. The first of three former Japan Airlines Boeing 727-100 series was introduced on 13 April 1973. Among other modifications, the aircraft needed a full stall protection system fitted to meet British civil airworthiness requirements.

Dan-Air&#x27;s original eight Boeing 727-100s, which entered service between 1973 and 1978, differed from overseas-registered aircraft. Dan-Air&#x27;s examples featured additional emergency doors each side of the rear fuselage as well as a stall-protection system known as a &quot;stick pusher&quot;. The additional exits were needed for having the aircraft certificated for an increased maximum seating capacity of 150. This necessitated satisfying the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requirement that all passengers could leave within 90 seconds using only half the available exits. Stall protection had been introduced in the light of experience with the stalling characteristics of both civil and military British T-tailed jet aircraft, including the loss of a Hawker Siddeley Trident on a test flight over Norfolk when it entered a deep stall. This stall-protection system consisted of a stick pusher, a &quot;nudger&quot; and an independent &quot;shaker&quot; for each pilot. When the aircraft was in danger of stalling it warned the pilots by shaking the control columns as well as correcting attitude and altitude, in an attempt to increase air speed and so avert an irrecoverable deep stall. It was estimated that installing stall-protection cost Dan-Air £100,000 per aircraft and up to £1 million for the entire fleet.

As well as the Comets and 727s, Dan-Air mainly operated BAC One-Elevens and Hawker Siddeley 748s during its most successful period in the 1970s and 1980s.

In May 1983, Dan-Air became the first to put the four-engined BAe 146 regional jetliner into commercial service.

==Accidents and incidents==

===Fatal accidents===
Throughout Dan-Air&#x27;s 39 years, the airline suffered seven accidents involving the loss of aircraft and lives, three of which killed fare-paying passengers. These accidents were :

*1958 Dan-Air Avro York crash: an Avro York crashed on 25 May 1958 while making a forced landing at Gurgaon, Haryana, India, after an engine had caught fire on an all-cargo flight from Karachi to Delhi. The radio operator was the sole survivor of the five occupants.
*A Piper PA-23 Apache 160 (G-ATFZ) operating a positioning/crew flight from Gatwick via Lasham to Bristol below cloud in poor weather crashed on 1 September 1966 at Loxhill, Hascombe, near Godalming, Surrey, England. The aircraft was destroyed and both pilots killed when it hit trees on the top of a hill near Godalming.
* Dan-Air Flight 1903: a de Havilland Comet 4 operating a charter flight from Manchester to Barcelona crashed into a mountain near Arbúcies in Catalonia in north-eastern Spain on 3 July 1970. The aircraft was destroyed and 105 passengers and seven crew died. This was the airline&#x27;s first accident resulting in fatalities among fare-paying passengers.
*1977 Dan-Air Boeing 707 crash: a Boeing 707-321C freighter on the last leg of an international cargo flight from Heathrow crashed near Lusaka Airport on 14 May 1977. The right-hand horizontal stabiliser — including the elevator assembly — detached during the approach as a result of metal fatigue, causing loss of pitch control. Other factors included the rear spar structure&#x27;s inadequate fail-safe design, the safety regulator&#x27;s design assessment and certification process as well as the inspection procedure adopted by the aircraft&#x27;s operator. The accident killed all six occupants. It sparked a debate on maintenance requirements as well as service life limitations of &quot;geriatric&quot; jets.
*Dan-Air Flight 0034: a Hawker Siddeley 748 series 1 (registration G-BEKF) operating an oil industry support flight crashed on 31 July 1979 at Sumburgh Airport in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. The aircraft failed to become airborne, ran through the perimeter fence, and crashed into the sea. The accident was due to the elevator gust lock having become re-engaged, preventing the aircraft from rotating into a flying attitude. The aircraft was destroyed and 17 of the 47 on board drowned.
*Dan-Air Flight 1008: a Boeing 727-46 (registration G-BDAN) crashed on 25 April 1980 while preparing to land at Los Rodeos (now Tenerife North Airport), Canary Islands, at the end of a charter flight from Manchester. The aircraft flew into high terrain when it turned the wrong way in a holding pattern. The aircraft was destroyed and all 146 on board were killed. This accident was the deadliest air disaster involving a British-registered aircraft in terms of loss of life.
* Dan-Air Flight 240: on 26 June 1981 a Hawker Siddeley 748 series 2 (registration G-ASPL) on a regular postal flight from Gatwick to East Midlands Airport crashed at Nailstone in Leicestershire (12 miles from its destination) killing both pilots and the postal assistant on board. The aircraft&#x27;s right rear door had sprung open in mid-air. It subsequently detached, hit the horizontal tailplane and became stuck on the leading edge. This resulted in a loss of control causing the aircraft to enter a steep dive, during which its wings and tailplane failed as a result of overstressing.

===Non-fatal incidents===
In addition to the fatal accidents listed above, Dan-Air suffered a number of non-fatal incidents, most of which occurred during the early years of the airline&#x27;s existence in the piston-engined era. These usually damaged the aircraft involved beyond repair but did not cause any loss of lives.

There were five incidents that made the headlines of the local and/or international mass media:
* In 1971, one of the airline&#x27;s Comets operating a charter flight carrying Turkish migrant workers from Berlin Tegel to Istanbul was &quot;escorted&quot; by Bulgarian fighter aircraft into Sofia. The crew flying the aircraft was attempting to take the shortest route to Istanbul when leaving Yugoslav airspace by entering Bulgarian airspace, instead of taking the longer route through Greek airspace. They were not aware of the then communist government of Bulgaria&#x27;s decision not to let any aircraft enter its airspace whose flight had originated or was going to terminate at a West Berlin airport, without stopping en route at another airport outside West Berlin. The aircraft landed safely at Sofia. It was released along with its crew and passengers when the flight&#x27;s commander paid the fine the Bulgarian authorities had imposed for violating their country&#x27;s airspace.
* In 1973, Somali fighter aircraft forced a Dan-Air Boeing 707 flying through Somali air space en route from London Gatwick to the Seychelles and Mauritius with 83 passengers on board to land at Mogadishu Airport. The aircraft was flying through Somali airspace in violation of the prescribed procedure to apply for permission to do so in advance, as a result of an &quot;administrative oversight&quot; on the airline&#x27;s part. As a consequence of this violation, the aircraft&#x27;s captain was taken to court and a fine of £600 was imposed on the airline.
* In 1974, one of the company&#x27;s Boeing 727s (a Boeing 727-46, registration: G-BAEF) hit the localiser antenna of Luton Airport&#x27;s Instrument Landing System while taking off on a charter flight to Corfu, rendering the system inoperative. The aircraft diverted to London Gatwick where it landed safely.
* On 30 September 1988, while completing the repair and run-up of the faulty engine that had caused a rejected takeoff due to an engine oil warning at Berlin Tegel, Dan-Air Boeing 727-217Adv. G-BKAG collided with a jetway at the airport&#x27;s terminal building while maintenance engineers taxied the aircraft back to its stand. This badly injured the ground crew member manning the jetway and ruptured the fully refuelled aircraft&#x27;s centre wing tank at the left wing root. As a result, a large quantity of jet fuel spilled onto the tarmac. The maintenance engineers&#x27; failure to pressurise the aircraft&#x27;s hydraulics had resulted in a complete loss of hydraulic pressure just before reaching the stand, making it impossible to steer the aircraft and rendering the brakes ineffective.
* On 2 March 1989, a Dan Air HS 748 mistakenly landed at Langford Lodge Airport instead of the nearby Belfast Aldergrove Airport, the intended destination of the scheduled service from Newcastle. When the aircraft broke cloud over Lough Neagh on short finals for Aldergrove&#x27;s runway 07, the pilot in command thought what he had spotted was the correct runway and proceeded to land the plane at what turned out to be the adjacent, privately owned, Langford Lodge airfield, just under a mile short of the approach to runway 07 at Aldergrove.

<doc id="827204" wikidata="Q2668049" url="?curid=827204" title="J. Gordon Melton">
<text>John Gordon Melton (born September 19, 1942) is an American religious scholar who was the founding director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion and is currently the Distinguished Professor of American Religious History with the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University in Waco, Texas where he resides. He is also an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church.

Melton is the author of more than forty-five books, including several encyclopedias, handbooks, and scholarly textbooks on American religious history, Methodism, world religions, and new religious movements (NRMs). His areas of research include major religious traditions, American Methodism, new and alternative religions, Western Esotericism (popularly called occultism), and parapsychology, New Age, and Dracula and vampire studies.

==Early life==
Melton was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of Burnum Edgar Melton and Inez Parker. During his senior year in high school, he came across &quot;The Small Sects in America&quot; by Elmer T. Clark; he became interested in reading as much as possible on alternative religions.

In 1964, he graduated from Birmingham Southern College with an A.B. degree in geology. After completing his undergraduate education he matriculated into Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary to study theology and ancient church history, graduating first in his class with a Master of Divinity in 1968. He completed doctoral studies at Northwestern University with a Ph.D. in He married Dorothea Dudley in 1966, who had one daughter, Melanie. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. His second wife is named Suzie.

== Main areas of research ==
===Christian countercult and secular anti-cult===
In his &quot;Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America,&quot; Melton distinguished the Christian countercult and the secular anti-cult movements. He articulated the distinction on the grounds that the two movements operate with very different epistemologies motives and methods. This distinction has been subsequently acknowledged by sociologists such as Douglas E. Cowan and Eileen Barker.

===Vampirism research===
From his college days, Melton developed an interest in the subject of vampires, which he has since pursued in his leisure time.

In 1997, Melton, Massimo Introvigne, and Elizabeth Miller organized an event at the Westin Hotel in Los Angeles where 1,500 attendees (some dressed as vampires) came for a &quot;creative writing contest, Gothic rock music and theatrical performances.&quot;

== Aum Shinrikyo investigation ==

In May 1995, during the investigation into the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, the group responsible for the attack, Aum Shinrikyo, contacted an American group known as AWARE (Association of World Academics for Religious Education), founded by American scholar James R. Lewis, claiming that the human rights of its members were being violated. Lewis recruited Melton, human rights lawyer Barry Fisher, and chemical expert Thomas Banigan. They flew to Japan, with their travel expenses paid by Aum, and announced that they would investigate and report through press conferences at the end of their trip.

In the press conferences, Fisher and Lewis announced that Aum could not have produced the sarin with which the attacks had been committed. They had determined this with their technical expert, Lewis said, based on photos and documents provided by the group.

British scholar of Japanese religions Ian Reader, in a detailed account of the incident, reported that Melton &quot;had few doubts by the end of his visit to Japan of Aum&#x27;s complicity&quot; and eventually &quot;concluded that Aum had in fact been involved in the attack and other crimes&quot;; The Washington Post account of the final press conference mentioned Lewis and Fisher but not Melton. Lewis, on the other hand, maintained his opinion that Aum had been framed and wrote that having the trip funded by Aum had been arranged &quot;so that financial considerations would not be attached to our final report.&quot;

Reader concluded, &quot;The visit was well-intentioned, and the participants were genuinely concerned about possible violations of civil rights in the wake of the extensive police investigations and detentions of followers.&quot; However, it was ill-fated and detrimental to the reputation of those involved. While distinguishing between Lewis&#x27; and Melton&#x27;s attitudes, Reader observed that both Japanese media and some fellow scholars also criticized Melton. Using stronger words, Canadian scholar Stephen A. Kent chastised both Lewis and Melton for having put the reputation of the whole category of scholars of new religious movements at risk.

==Criticism==
Melton&#x27;s scholarly works concentrate on the phenomenology and not the theology of NRMs. Some Christian countercultists criticize Melton for not critiquing the groups he reports on from an evangelical perspective, arguing that his failure to do so is incompatible with his statements of professed evangelicalism. Some secular anti-cultists who feel that new religious movements are dangerous and that scholars should actively work against them have likewise criticized him. Stephen A. Kent and Theresa Krebs, for example, characterized Gordon Melton, James R. Lewis, and Anson Shupe as biased towards the groups they study.

<text>Richard Thomas Mabey (born 20 February 1941) is a writer and broadcaster, chiefly on the relations between nature and culture.

==Education==
Mabey was educated at three independent schools, all in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. The first was at Rothesay School, followed by Berkhamsted Preparatory School and then Berkhamsted School. He then went to St Catherine&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

==Life and work==
After Oxford, Mabey worked as a lecturer in Social Studies in Further Education at Dacorum College, Hemel Hempstead, then as a senior editor at Penguin Books. He became a full-time writer in 1974. He spent most of his life among the beechwoods of the Chilterns. He now lives in the Waveney Valley in Norfolk, with his partner Polly Lavender, and retreats to a boat on the Norfolk Broads.

He appeared in a 1975 episode of the BBC Television series &quot;The World About Us&quot;, &quot;In Deepest Britain&quot;, with John Gooders and other naturalists, giving an unscripted narration of the wildlife observed during a country walk. He wrote and presented later episodes of the series, including &quot;The Unofficial Countryside&quot; (1975), &quot;The Flowering of Britain&quot; (1980) and &quot;A Prospect of Kew&quot;, about Kew Gardens (1981). &quot;The Unofficial Countryside&quot; and &quot;The Flowering of Britain&quot; were based on his books of the same names. He also wrote and narrated the 1996 BBC television series &quot;Postcards from the Country&quot;, for whose eight, 40-minute episodes he was series producer, as well as being the producer-director on four. The book of the series &quot;Postcards from the Country: living memories of the British countryside&quot; (by Peter Marren and Mike Birkhead) includes a foreword by Mabey. &quot;White Rock, Black Water&quot; (1985) was a specially written episode of the series &quot;The Natural World&quot;, about the limestone country of the Yorkshire Dales, and a Channel 4 eight-part series – &quot;Back to the Roots&quot; – explored the role of plants in Britain&#x27;s contemporary culture. In the 1990s he often appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Country File&quot;.

Between 1982 and 1986 he sat on the UK government&#x27;s advisory body, the Nature Conservancy Council. Mabey writes regularly for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Granta&quot;. A selection of these writings was compiled as the book &quot;Country Matters&quot;. He has written a personal column in &quot;BBC Wildlife&quot; magazine since 1984, and a selection of these columns has been published as &quot;A Brush with Nature&quot;.

Between 2000 and 2002 Mabey suffered from depression, and his book &quot;Nature Cure&quot;, describing his experiences and recovery in the context of man&#x27;s relationship with landscape and nature, was short-listed for three major literary awards: the Whitbread Biography of the Year, the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s Ondaatje Prize for evoking the spirit of place and the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography.

He has edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, Flora Thompson and Peter Matthiessen. His contributions to BBC Radio include &quot;The Scientist and the Romantic&quot;, a series of five essays on his lifelong relationship with science and the natural environment broadcast in &quot;The Essay&quot; on Radio 3 in 2009, and &quot;Changing Climates&quot;, on our everyday experience of living with the weather, in 2013. Mabey was the first president of the London Wildlife Trust and later a vice-president; Mabey&#x27;s Meadow, named for him by the London Wildlife Trust, was one of his favourite haunts, and is described in his book &quot;The Unofficial Countryside&quot; (1974). It provides the only access to Frays Island in the River Colne.

==Awards and distinctions==

Mabey has been awarded two Leverhulme Fellowships, and honorary doctorates by St Andrews, Essex and East Anglia for his contributions to nature writing. He was awarded a Civil List Pension in 2008 for services to literature. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2011. He is a trustee of the arts and conservation charity Common Ground, vice-president of the Open Spaces Society, patron of the John Clare Society and president of the Waveney and Blythe Arts.

His life of Gilbert White won the 1986 Whitbread Biography of the Year. His &quot;Flora Britannica&quot; won the British Book Awards&#x27; Illustrated Book of the Year and the Botanical Society of the British Isles&#x27; President&#x27;s Award, and was runner-up for the BP Natural World Book Prize.

He was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1997.

==Portraits==

The National Portrait Gallery has a 1984 bromide print of Richard Mabey by Mark Gerson. Mabey sat for sculptor Jon Edgar in Norfolk during 2007, as part of the &quot;Environment Triptych&quot; (2008) along with Mary Midgley and James Lovelock.

<doc id="827224" wikidata="Q5121263" url="?curid=827224" title="CipherSaber">
<text>CipherSaber is a simple symmetric encryption protocol based on the RC4 stream cipher. Its goals are both technical and political: it gives reasonably strong protection of message confidentiality, yet it&#x27;s designed to be simple enough that even novice programmers can memorize the algorithm and implement it from scratch. According to the designer, a CipherSaber version in the QBASIC programming language takes just sixteen lines of code. Its political aspect is that because it&#x27;s so simple, it can be reimplemented anywhere at any time, and so it provides a way for users to communicate privately even if government or other controls make distribution of normal cryptographic software completely impossible.

==History and purpose==

CipherSaber was invented by Arnold Reinhold to keep strong cryptography in the hands of the public. Many governments have implemented legal restrictions on who can use cryptography, and many more have proposed them. By publicizing details on a secure yet easy-to-program encryption algorithm, Reinhold hopes to keep encryption technology accessible to everyone.

Unlike programs like PGP which are distributed as convenient-to-use prewritten software, Reinhold publishes CipherSaber only as a specification. The specification is intended to be so simple that even a beginning programmer can implement it easily. As the CipherSaber web site explains:
:&quot;In George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, Jedi Knights were expected to make their own light sabers. The message was clear: a warrior confronted by a powerful empire bent on totalitarian control must be self-reliant. As we face a real threat of a ban on the distribution of strong cryptography, in the United States and possibly world-wide, we should emulate the Jedi masters by learning how to build strong cryptography programs all by ourselves. If this can be done, strong cryptography will become impossible to suppress.&quot;

The web site has a graphics file that displays as a &quot;CipherKnight&quot; certificate; however, that file is encrypted using CipherSaber with a known key published alongside the file. Users can view the graphic (and optionally print it out for framing) by first writing their own CipherSaber implementation to decrypt the file. By writing their own implementation and performing a few other small tasks, the user becomes a CipherKnight and the decrypted certificate attests to their knighthood. So, rather than providing a ready-made tool, CipherSaber&#x27;s designer hopes to help computer users understand that they&#x27;re capable of making their own strong cryptography programs without having to rely on professional developers or the permission of the government.

== Technical description ==

In the original version of CipherSaber (now called CipherSaber-1 or CS1), each encrypted message begins with a random ten-byte initialization vector (IV). This IV is appended to the CipherSaber key to form the input to the RC4 key setup algorithm. The message, XORed with the RC4 keystream, immediately follows.

The Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack on RC4 has rendered CipherSaber-1 vulnerable if a large number (&gt;1000) messages are sent with the same CipherSaber key. To address this, the CipherSaber designer has made a modified protocol (called CipherSaber-2) in which the RC4 key setup loop is repeated multiple times (20 is recommended). In addition to agreeing on a secret key, parties communicating with CipherSaber-2 must agree on how many times to repeat this loop.

The ciphertext output is a binary byte stream that is designed to be &quot;indistinguishable from random noise&quot;. For use with communications systems that can accept only ASCII data, the author recommends encoding the byte stream as hexadecimal digits. This is less efficient than, for example, base64 MIME encoding, but it is much simpler to program, keeping with CipherSaber&#x27;s goal of maximal ease of implementation.

==Security and usability==
CipherSaber is strong enough and usable enough to make its political point effectively. However, it falls markedly short of the security and convenience one would normally ask of such a cryptosystem. While CipherKnights can use CipherSaber to exchange occasional messages with each other reasonably securely, either for fun or in times of great distress, CipherSaber strips cryptography to its bare essentials and it does not offer enough features to be suitable for wide deployment and routine daily use. CipherSaber&#x27;s author in fact asks users to download and install PGP as one of the steps of becoming a CipherKnight. CipherSaber can be seen as a last-resort fallback system to use if programs like PGP are banned. Some, but not all of CipherSaber&#x27;s sacrifices and shortcomings are unique to RC4.

* CipherSaber provides no message authentication. This vulnerability, shared by all pure stream ciphers, is straightforward to exploit. For example, an attacker who knows that the message contains &quot;Meet Jane and me tomorrow at 3:30 pm&quot; at a particular point can recover the keystream at that point from the ciphertext and plaintext. Then the attacker can replace the original content with any other content of exactly the same length, such as &quot;3:30 meeting is cancelled, stay home&quot; by encrypting it with the recovered keystream, without knowing the encryption key.
* Like most ciphers in use for bulk data transfer today, CipherSaber is a symmetric-key cipher. Thus, each pair of communicating users must somehow securely agree on an encryption key, and each user must securely store the encryption keys of those they are to communicate with. Agreeing on encryption keys when the only communications channels available are insecure is the classic chicken-and-egg problem solved by public key cryptography as provided by PGP-like programs. Avoiding the need for secure symmetric key agreements between every pair of users is of considerable convenience and generally improves security. A protocol typically used to achieve good efficiency and convenience is to use a public key cipher such as RSA for key exchange, then a symmetric-key cipher such as CipherSaber for bulk data transfer using the negotiated key.
* The short key-setup RC4 used in CipherSaber-1 is broken: RC4&#x27;s original key scheduling is now known to be too weak to protect a large number of ciphertexts encrypted using the same key. CipherSaber-2 modifies CipherSaber-1&#x27;s key setup procedure by repeating it multiple times in the hope of improving its security (the result is equivalent to using conventional RC4 starting with a key that&#x27;s been preprocessed by a complex algorithm). While this procedure is believed to close the RC4 key scheduling vulnerability, its effectiveness has not been proven.
* Like any chosen-key cipher, both versions of CipherSaber are vulnerable to dictionary attack if the chosen key (which would normally be a password or passphrase) does not have sufficient entropy. Symmetric-key cryptography implementations usually include a facility for generating random keys when high security is required. The CipherSaber site recommends generating high entropy random passphrases using Diceware.
* Like most other cryptosystems (including PGP), CipherSaber makes no provisions at all to prevent attackers from &quot;detecting&quot; (as opposed to decrypting) the encrypted messages. This is a potentially serious problem in some situations for which CipherSaber was designed: if the government has banned the distribution of cryptographic software, it probably also will want to pounce on anyone who it finds sending encrypted messages. See traffic analysis and steganography for more about these issues and their countermeasures.

<text>The BMW Z3 is a range of two-seater sports cars which was produced from 1995 to 2002. The body styles of the range are:
* 2-door roadster (E36/7 model code)
* 2-door coupé (E36/8 model code)

The Z3 was based on the E36/5 compact platform, a shortened version of the conventional E36 platform. This smaller and cheaper platform used the rear semi-trailing arm suspension design from the older E30 3 Series. It is the first mass-produced Z Series car.

M models were introduced in 1998 in roadster and coupé body styles and were powered by the S50, S52, or S54 straight-six engine depending on country and model year. The M models came with a 5-speed manual transmission. The regular Z3s were offered with straight-sixes or four-cylinder engines.

Production ended on June 28, 2002, with the Z3 line replaced by the E85 Z4.

==Development and launch==
Development on the roadster began in 1991 and was led by Burkhard Göschel. The exterior was designed by Joji Nagashima, being completed in mid-1992 at 39 months before production and the design was frozen in 1993. Design patents were filed on April 2, 1994, in Germany and on September 27, 1994, in the US. The Z3 was introduced via video press release by BMW North America on June 12, 1995. Production began on September 20, 1995.

Development on the coupé model was run by a group of BMW engineers outside of work in their own time. The Z3 Coupé shares the identical platform and parts with the roadster, but features a chassis-stiffening hatch area and is 2.7 times stiffer in comparison. The Z3 Coupé was unveiled at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show.

The Z3 was the first BMW car to be solely manufactured outside of Germany. It was manufactured in Greer, South Carolina.

==Body styles==
===Roadster (E36/7)===
Roadster models entered production in September 1995, powered by 4-cylinder engines on launch. 6-cylinder engines were later introduced in 1996. A removable hardtop roof was available as an optional accessory.

===Coupé (E36/8)===
Coupé models entered production in January 1998. The unusual side profile has been given nicknames such as &quot;clown shoe&quot; and &quot;bread van&quot; by critics. In Germany, it has been referred to as a &quot;turnschuh&quot; (sports shoe).

The coupé body style was only available with the engines that matched the 2.8, 3.0i, and M model Roadsters. The engine outputs varied as they spanned three generations of engine architecture, peaking at 325 horsepower with the facelift M Coupé. Like the roadster models, it was rear-wheel drive only, and was available in either an automatic or manual transmission. Very few of these cars were made, making it rarer than most cars, the BMW M Coupe model especially so.

==Transmissions==
The available transmissions are:
* 5-speed ZF S5-31 manual (Z3 2.8 / 3.0i / Z3M)
* 5-speed Getrag 250 manual (Z3 1.8 / 1.9i / 2.0 / 2.2i / 2.5)
* 4-speed GM 4L30-E automatic (Z3 1.9 / 2.0 / 2.5 / 2.8)
* 5-speed GM 5L40-E automatic (Z3 2.2i / 2.5 / 3.0)

==Models==
The 4-cylinder models feature a single tailpipe, while six-cylinder models have dual tailpipes, wider rear fenders (for pre-facelift models) and a revised front bumper. M models featured the same wider fenders as the six-cylinder models but with unique front and rear bumpers, side mirrors and the M division&#x27;s first use of a quad exhaust pipe arrangement.

The 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2i models were unavailable in the United States. The U.S. was also the only market to receive the 2.3 and 2.5 models

==M models==
The M versions were introduced in 1997 in the roadster (&quot;M Roadster&quot;) and coupé (&quot;M Coupé&quot;) body styles. European models were initially powered by the S50 inline-six engine, while North American models were powered by the less powerful S52 inline-six engine. In 2001 both the European and North American models switched to the new S54 engine. The Z3M was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission.

Compared to the standard Z3, M models featured a limited slip differential, a wider rear track, and larger brakes (that are shared with the E36 M3). M models were available in M-specific colors and feature numerous aesthetic and aerodynamic differences versus the rest of the Z3 range, including more aerodynamic wing-mirrors, redesigned front and rear bumpers, bespoke &quot;Roadstar&quot; Style 40 wheels, revised side gills, and quad exhaust pipes. The interior can also be differentiated by the voltmeter, clock, and oil temperature gauges in the center console as well as unique M-styled seats and interior color options.

Unlike the rest of the Z3 range, the M Roadster and the M Coupé did not receive cosmetic changes during the facelift in 2000.

==Special models==
===James Bond Edition===

To tie in with its appearance in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, a James Bond film which was released the same year, BMW released a &quot;James Bond Edition&quot; Z3 that was offered for sale through the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog. The James Bond Edition was sold in 1996 for . BMW and Neiman Marcus had originally set a 20-unit sales goal, but this was later increased to 100 units after receiving a high level of interest from customers.

The James Bond Edition was based on the Z3 1.9i and included a 007 dash plaque, 007 floor mats, unique wheels, and chrome exterior trim. The color scheme was an &quot;Atlanta blue&quot; exterior with beige leather interior, matching the Z3 which appeared in GoldenEye.
The VIN of all 100 limited edition cars has code 007, and the last two indicate that out of 100 produced there is a specific example (...00700 to 00799). Exactly half of the cars (50 pieces) had a manual transmission and the same number had an automatic transmission.

===V12 prototype===
In 1999, the BMW M division produced a single prototype Z3 powered by the 5.4 L M73 V12 engine in order to test the space efficiency of the engine bay. It is based on the Z3 roadster, has 17 inch wheels with 225/45 tires up front and 245/40 at the rear, and is painted in a shade of orange. The V12 was rated at at 5,000 rpm and of torque at 3,900 rpm, and power was sent through a 6-speed manual transmission. The concept is much heavier than the standard Z3 at , with nearly all of that excess weight attributable to the V12—the big engine resulted in a 70/30 weight distribution front/rear. The concept was fully functional and was tested by the German motoring magazine &quot;Autozeitung&quot; in 1999. Their tests revealed a time of 5.5 seconds, a standing kilometer () in 24.4 seconds, and a top speed of .

===M Coupé Safety Car===
A safety car variant of the BMW M Coupé was produced by the BMW M division for MotoGP and used in the 2000 season.

==Model year changes==
===1997===
* M Roadster and M Coupé models introduced to the public.
* BMW Individual introduced to Z3 models.

===1998===
* Coupé models introduced.
* Wood trim and a power soft top were added as options.
* Rollover hoops introduced.
* Automatic stability control (ASC) became standard equipment on 1.9 models.
* Hardtop shell option for Z3 models introduced.

===1999 facelift===
In April 1999, the facelift (LCI) versions of the Z3 began production. Major changes include:
* The &quot;Z3 2.0&quot; model was replaced by the &quot;Z3 2.2i&quot; and the &quot;Z3 2.8&quot; model was replaced by the &quot;Z3 3.0i&quot;, as the inline-six engines were upgraded from the M52 to the M54 (the addition of the &quot;i&quot; to the model names is not significant, since all engines use electronic fuel injection). In the United States, the &quot;Z3 2.3&quot; model was replaced by the &quot;Z3 2.5&quot;.
* Exterior design changes including redesigned chrome ring headlights and L-shaped taillights, wider rear track by 2.5 in (64mm) (now the same across 4 and 6-cylinder models), model designation badges, finger indent for trunk release button, integrated third brake light (with silver lights on 2.8 and 3.0i models), chrome exhaust tips, and new wheel designs. The Z3M models did not receive these exterior changes.
* Interior design changes including redesigned centre console buttons with a clock in the middle and a new three-spoke steering wheel design.
* Electronic stability control upgraded from ASC to new DSC system.
* New three-layer insulation convertible roof with headlining.
* Dual-stage side airbags introduced.

===2000===
* DSC now integrated with Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) and Automatic Differential Brake (ADB) functions.

===2001===
* Z3M models switched from the BMW S50 (Euro spec) and BMW S52 (U.S. spec) inline-six engines to the BMW S54 inline-six engine.

==Production volumes==
One source provides the data below for production figures. However, there are other sources which provide conflicting information, so actual figures are not certain.
==Marketing==
The Z3 appeared briefly in the James Bond movie &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, in a scene where Bond is driving in Cuba. Bond would eventually trade the car in exchange for Jack Wade&#x27;s plane. The Z3 is one of only a few non-British production cars to be driven by James Bond throughout the history of the film franchise, and the first of three James Bond films that prominently featured a BMW. This break in tradition was due to a three-film licensing deal between BMW and the James Bond franchise that began with &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and ended with &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. The Z3 in GoldenEye features stinger missiles hidden behind the headlights, an emergency parachute braking system, and a radar scanner in the form of a LCD screen in the dashboard. It is also noted during the briefing scene that the car contains a passenger ejector seat and a self-destruct system, though they aren&#x27;t used at any point in the film. The Z3 is also one of the few vehicles in the Q-Branch that was not destroyed in the field. Fans of the franchise were not enthused with the BMW product placement, all the more so since the Z3 never was given a scene in which to use the weaponry and defense features that have always distinguished a James Bond car. This was ultimately rectified with the BMW 750iL in the following film, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;.

Two blue prototypes were provided in January 1995 for filming at the Leavesden Aerodrome. The agreement between BMW and Eon Productions was for cross-promotion of the car and the film, and no money changed hands.

Sales of the Z3 spiked as the film sat at number one at the box office. The entire 1996 BMW Z3 roadster production run, more than 15,000 roadsters, was sold out by the time the car was introduced.

The Z3 appeared in &quot;The Follow&quot;, one of the BMW films released in 2001.

<text>Amanita virosa is a species of fungus in the class Agaricomycetes. In the UK, it has the recommended English name of destroying angel and is known internationally as the European destroying angel. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are agaricoid (mushroom-shaped) and pure white with a ring on the stem and a sack-like volva at the base. The species is deadly poisonous. It occurs in Europe and northern Asia. &quot;Amanita virosa&quot; was formerly reported from North America, but research has shown that similar-looking American species, including &quot;Amanita bisporigera&quot; and &quot;A. ocreata&quot;, are distinct.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Amanita virosa&quot; was first described in 1838 by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as &quot;Agaricus virosus&quot;, but this name is illegitimate since it had already been used for an earlier and different species. &quot;Amanita virosa&quot; was legitimately published by French mycologist Louis-Adolphe Bertillon in 1866. 

==Etymology==
The specific epithet is derived from the Latin adjective &quot;virōsus&quot; meaning &#x27;toxic&#x27; (compare virus).

==Description==

&quot;Amanita virosa&quot; first appears as a white, egg-shaped object covered with a universal veil. As it expands, the mushroom-shaped fruit body breaks free, though ragged patches of veil may persist at the cap edges. The cap is initially conical with inturned edges, before becoming hemispherical and flattening with a diameter up to . The cap often has a distinctive boss; it is able to be peeled and is white, though the centre may be ivory. The crowded, free gills are white, as is the stipe and volva. The thin stipe is up to tall, with a hanging, grooved ring. The spore print is white and the spores are subglobose and 7–10 μm long. They are amyloid, staining purple with Melzer&#x27;s reagent. The flesh is white, with a smell reminiscent of radishes, and turns bright yellow with sodium hydroxide.

===Similar species===
In Europe, the spring-fruiting &quot;Amanita verna&quot; is a similar all-white species, as is the autumn-fruiting, white form of &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; (deathcap). Both are equally poisonous. In their immature, button-mushroom stage, all these poisonous species could be mistaken for young, white-capped, edible mushrooms (&quot;Agaricus&quot; species), highlighting the danger of picking immature fruit bodies for food.

==Habitat and distribution==
&quot;Amanita virosa&quot; is found in woodland in late summer and autumn, especially in association with beech and chestnut, but also with pine, spruce, and fir. As with most &quot;Amanita&quot; species, it forms a mutually beneficial, ectomycorrhizal relationship with the roots of these trees. &quot;Amanita virosa&quot; was originally described from Sweden and is known throughout Europe, with additional confirmed records from northern Asia (China). The name was formerly used for similar-looking agarics in North America, but research has shown that these American species, including the eastern &quot;Amanita bisporigera&quot;, the western &quot;A. ocreata&quot;, and the northern &quot;Amanita amerivirosa&quot;, are distinct.

==Toxicity==
&quot;Amanita virosa&quot; is highly toxic, and has been responsible for severe mushroom poisonings. Eating just one cap of &quot;A. virosa&quot; is enough to kill an adult human. The symptoms of poisoning generally come several hours after consumption, a delay which may make treatment more difficult. 

Fruit bodies contain both amatoxins and phallotoxins.

Amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-Amanitin is the chief component and along with β-Amanitin is probably responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA, (snRNA). Without mRNA essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism cease and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible.

Phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds, all of which have seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was isolated in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland&#x27;s student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to have little input into the destroying angel&#x27;s toxicity as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible &quot;Amanita rubescens&quot;. Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins they do not exert any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.

It is unclear why this fungus, which closely resembles edible species, has been implicated in fewer deaths than the death cap, though its comparative rarity may contribute to this. Some authorities strongly advise against putting fruit bodies in the same basket with those collected for the table and to avoid handling them. 

===Treatment===
Consumption of &quot;Amanita virosa&quot; is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization. There are four main categories of therapy for poisoning: preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and liver transplantation.

Preliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, due to the delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment many hours after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.

No definitive antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, but some specific treatments have been shown to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (&quot;Silybum marianum&quot;), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins that are returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success but overall do not appear to improve outcome.

In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, there has been a reassessment of criteria such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.

==Potential uses==
&quot;Amanita virosa&quot; extract has antibacterial efficacy against &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; &quot;in vitro&quot;. It also has shown inhibitory activity on thrombin.

<doc id="827228" wikidata="Q1708114" url="?curid=827228" title="Godhra">
<text>Godhra () is a municipality in Panchmahal district in Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of the Panchmahal district. Originally the name came from &quot;gou&quot; which means &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;dhara&quot;- which have two meanings depending on how you pronounce the word: &#x27;dharaa&#x27; means a feminine thing or person that &quot;holds&quot; something and it usually means&quot;land&quot;, and the other pronunciation is &#x27;dhaaraa&#x27; in which means &quot;flow&quot;. However, the second pronunciation is not popular nor is usually associated with this word. Hence, &#x27;Godhra or Godharaa&#x27; means the Land of the Cow.

Godhra is widely known in India and internationally for being the starting point of the 2002 Gujarat riots. Statewide religious riots between Hindus and Muslims began after the Godhra train burning incident near the Godhra railway station on 27 February 2002, where about 59 train passengers were burnt alive. It was in Godhra that Vallabhbhai Patel first met Gandhi in 1917 and was subsequently drawn into the Indian freedom struggle.

Godhra is a road and rail junction and a commercial centre for timber and agricultural produce. Industries include oilseed pressing, flour milling, and glass manufacture.

Godhra has a science, commerce, arts, law, ITI, engineering and medical colleges.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Godhrā&quot; is derived from earlier &quot;Godrahaka&quot;, referring to a pond or lake where cattle or buffalo came (perhaps to bathe).

As per local folklore, cows used to come here from Pavagadh for grazing.

Gujarati Historic Novel named &quot;Gujaratno Jay&quot; written by Zaverchand Meghani based on various Jain Prabandhas describes city as Godhpur(ગોધપુર).

== History ==
A bronze of Lord Rishabhanath from AD 975 was found at Akota which mentions Gohadra kula, i.e., the school of Jain monks at Gohadra. The historical name of Godhra is &quot;Godhrahk&quot;, which was established by Parmar king named Dhudhul Mandalik in A.D. 1415.
Five hundred years ago, in the 15th century, the respectable Saint Shrimad Vallabhacharya in his morning ritual speech gave the example of his dream city. He explained how the city which was seen in the dream by her daughter was handed over by a Muslim resident to a Hindu family.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 India census, Godhra had a population of 143,644. Males constitute 63.68% of the population and females 36.32%. Godhra has an average literacy rate of 93.51%, higher than the national average of 74.04%. Male literacy is 96.25%, and female literacy is 85.44%

 India census, Godhra had a population of 121,852. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Godhra has an average literacy rate of 73%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy was 79.5%, and female literacy was 64.5%.

In 1901 the population was 20,915.

== Government and politics ==
Godhra city is governed by a municipality. The city is divided into 12 wards for the purpose of administration, and each ward is represented by 3 councillors. The city is also represented by an MP elected from the Panchmahal Lok Sabha constituency (erstwhile Godhra Lok sabha constituency), Ratansinh Rathore from the BJP, and an MLA elected from the Godhra Assembly constituency, CK Raulji.

I. I. Chundrigar, former Prime Minister of Pakistan was born in Godhra in 1897.

==Religious violence==
Several incidents of communal violence have taken place in Godhra before and after the independence of India. Notable acts of violence include:

*During 1947–48, riots broke out in Godhra between the Ghanchi Muslim community and Sindhis who had emigrated from Pakistan after the Partition of India. About 3,500 properties were burnt down in the violence.
*Between October 1980 and September 1981, six major communal riots, arson and pillaging took place between the majority Muslim community and Sindhi people in Godhra. Five members of a Sindhi family were burnt alive in the Muslim-dominated area of Signalfalia. As a result of the violence and loss of life, the town was placed under curfew for about 245 days during this period.
*In 1990, four Hindu teachers were killed by a Muslim mob in Vorwad area of Godhra.
*Godhra train burning – In 2002, a Muslim mob was accused to set fire to the Sabarmati Express near Godhra railway station. 59 Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya were killed in the fire. This incident is perceived as the trigger for the 2002 Gujarat riots.

==Connectivity==
Godhra is connected to all major towns of Gujarat by public transport service operated by GSRTC. And Godhra is a Railway Junction that connects Godhra with different parts of the state and nation.

India&#x27;s biggest national highway Delhi-Mumbai expressway pass through godhra.

== Culture ==

=== Religious importance ===
* Sat Kaival Temple at Bagaidol village of Godhra is a temple of sat kaival sampraday.
* Godhra is one of the religious places in India which has four bethaks (temples) for Vaishnav Sampraday. There are two main seats of Lord Gokulnathji and one each for Lord Gusaiji and Lord Mahaprabhuji. Godhra is the only city in India that has all three seats (or &quot;bhaitaks&quot;) of the Mahaprabhuji, Gusianji, and Gokulnathji
* Godhra has three Jain temples. The main idol (or &quot;Mul Nayak&quot;) in the Jain Temple is of Shantinath. It also has a temple called the &#x27;Trimandir&#x27;, a non-sectarian temple founded by Dada Bhagwan in the Bhamaiya area (Ahmedabad Road).
* Godhra has BAPS and SMVS swaminarayan temple.
* Godhra has Sheikh Majhawar graveyard, which is believed to be one of the biggest in Asia.
*Makar Sakranti, Maha Shivratri, Holi, diwali, Eid al-Fitr, Baisakhi, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi, Eid al-Adha, Muharram, Christmas, Dussehra, Easter are celebrated.

<text>A piece of antique furniture is a collectible interior furnishing of considerable age. Often the age, rarity, condition, utility, or other unique features make a piece of furniture desirable as a collectors&#x27; item, and thus termed an antique. The antique furniture pieces reflect the style and features of the time they were made; this can be called the antique&#x27;s &quot;period&quot; (Edwardian, Tudor, Colonial, etc.). Christie&#x27;s defines it as being over 100 years old.

Antique furniture may support the human body (such as seating or beds), provide storage, or hold objects on horizontal surfaces above the ground. Storage furniture (which often makes use of doors, drawers, and shelves) is used to hold or contain smaller objects such as clothes, tools, books, and household goods. Furniture can be a product of artistic design and is considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture&#x27;s functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. Domestic furniture works to create, in conjunction with furnishings such as clocks and lighting, comfortable and convenient interior spaces. Furniture can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Cabinetry and cabinet making are terms for the skill set used in the building of furniture.

The earliest furniture was simple and practical, but as furniture became crafted and decorated it became an early status symbol. Wealthy homeowners demanded that their furnishings reflect their status and lifestyles.

<doc id="827232" wikidata="Q6497909" url="?curid=827232" title="Inert-pair effect">
<text>The inert-pair effect is the tendency of the two electrons in the outermost atomic &quot;s&quot;-orbital to remain unshared in compounds of post-transition metals. The term &quot;inert-pair effect&quot; is often used in relation to the increasing stability of oxidation states that are two less than the group valency for the heavier elements of groups 13, 14, 15 and 16. The term &quot;inert pair&quot; was first proposed by Nevil Sidgwick in 1927. The name suggests that the outermost &quot;s&quot; electron pairs are more tightly bound to the nucleus in these atoms, and therefore more difficult to ionize or share.

For example, the p-block elements of the 4th, 5th and 6th period come after d-block elements, but the electrons present in the intervening d- (and f-) orbitals do not effectively shield the s-electrons of the valence shell. As a result, the &quot;inert pair&quot; of &quot;n&quot;s electrons remains more tightly held by the nucleus and hence participates less in bond formation.

==Description==
Consider as an example thallium (Tl) in group 13. The +1 oxidation state of Tl is the most stable, while Tl3+ compounds are comparatively rare. The stability of the +1 oxidation state increases in the following sequence:
:Al+ &lt; Ga+ &lt; In+ &lt; Tl+.

The same trend in stability is noted in groups 14, 15 and 16. The heaviest members of each group, i.e. lead, bismuth and polonium are comparatively stable in oxidation states +2, +3, and +4 respectively.

The lower oxidation state in each of the elements in question has two valence electrons in s orbitals. A partial explanation is that the valence electrons in an s orbital are more tightly bound and are of lower energy than electrons in p orbitals and therefore less likely to be involved in bonding. If the total ionization energies (IE) (see below) of the two electrons in s orbitals (the 2nd + 3rd ionization energies) are examined, it can be seen that there is an expected decrease from B to Al associated with increased atomic size, but the values for Ga, In and Tl are higher than expected. 

 The high ionization energy (IE) (2nd + 3rd) of gallium is explained by d-block contraction, and the higher IE (2nd + 3rd) of thallium relative to indium, has been explained by relativistic effects. The higher value for thallium compared to indium is partly attributable to the influence of the lanthanide contraction and the ensuing poor shielding from the nuclear charge by the intervening filled 4d and 5f subshells.

An important consideration is that compounds in the lower oxidation state are ionic, whereas the compounds in the higher oxidation state tend to be covalent. Therefore, covalency effects must be taken into account. An alternative explanation of the inert pair effect by Drago in 1958 attributed the effect to low M−X bond enthalpies for the heavy p-block elements and the fact that it requires less energy to oxidize an element to a low oxidation state than to a higher oxidation state. This energy has to be supplied by ionic or covalent bonds, so if bonding to a particular element is weak, the high oxidation state may be inaccessible. Further work involving relativistic effects confirms this.

In the case of groups 13 to 15 the inert-pair effect has been further attributed to &quot;the decrease in bond energy with the increase in size from Al to Tl so that the energy required to involve the s electron in bonding is not compensated by the energy released in forming the two additional bonds&quot;. That said, the authors note that several factors are at play, including relativistic effects in the case of gold, and that &quot;a quantitative rationalisation of all the data has not been achieved&quot;.

==Steric activity of the lone pair==
The chemical inertness of the s electrons in the lower oxidation state is not always related to steric inertness (where steric inertness means that the presence of the s-electron lone pair has little or no influence on the geometry of the molecule or crystal). A simple example of steric activity is SnCl2, which is bent in accordance with VSEPR theory. Some examples where the lone pair appears to be inactive are bismuth(III) iodide, BiI3, and the anion. In both of these the central Bi atom is octahedrally coordinated with little or no distortion, in contravention to VSEPR theory.
The steric activity of the lone pair has long been assumed to be due to the orbital having some p character, i.e. the orbital is not spherically symmetric. More recent theoretical work shows that this is not always necessarily the case. For example, the litharge structure of PbO contrasts to the more symmetric and simpler rock-salt structure of PbS, and this has been explained in terms of PbII–anion interactions in PbO leading to an asymmetry in electron density. Similar interactions do not occur in PbS. Another example are some thallium(I) salts where the asymmetry has been ascribed to s electrons on Tl interacting with antibonding orbitals.

<text>William Edward Nordeen (October 9, 1936 – June 28, 1988) was a US Navy captain and diplomat. Born in Amery, Wisconsin and raised in nearby Centuria, he was the United States defense and naval attaché to the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Greece. Nordeen was killed in Greece by a bomb set off by far-left anti-imperialist urban guerrilla group 17 November due to his involvement in the US Navy and the US embassy in Greece.

== Death ==
The 51-year-old US Navy captain was driving in an armor-plated sedan near Athens when a car bomb was detonated next to him via remote control. He was thrown from the car and killed by the blast. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

The Greek urban guerrilla Marxist organization 17 November claimed the blast, making Nordeen one of five American embassy employees killed by the organization.

<doc id="827238" wikidata="Q4681194" url="?curid=827238" title="Addington Long Barrow">
<text>Addington Long Barrow is a chambered long barrow located near the village of Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Probably constructed in the fourth millennium BCE, during Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built of earth and about fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably once formed a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited, though none have been discovered.

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Addington Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both Chestnuts Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Two further surviving long barrows, Kit&#x27;s Coty House and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, as well as the destroyed Smythe&#x27;s Megalith and possible survivals such as the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, are located on the Medway&#x27;s eastern side.

After the Early Neolithic, the long barrow fell into ruins, with a small road being built through the centre of the monument by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are on private land and are no longer (as of October 2019) accessible to the public.

==Location==

The monument lies approximately north of Addington Parish Church. It is accessible from the A20 via two minor roads. The area in which the barrow is located is sometimes termed Addington Park. The site is privately owned, although it is visible from a road that cuts through the middle of the barrow. Geologically, it is located on the Lower Greensand.

==Context==

The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. The change came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Amygdaloideae (stone-fruit trees). Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island&#x27;s Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

=== Medway Megaliths ===
Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included chambered long barrows: rectangular or oval earthen tumuli that had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, while others were built using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, including most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. While there are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all in a ruinous state, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two clusters between and apart: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east. Addington Long Barrow is part of the western group, which also includes Coldrum Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, while various stones on the eastern side of the river, most notably the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, may also have been parts of such structures. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession; nor is it known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum&#x27;s rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow&#x27;s facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit&#x27;s Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The Medway Megaliths&#x27; builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines elsewhere that they were aware of. Whether the builders had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries, while fellow archaeologist Glyn Daniel believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia. John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group. Alexander thought their closest similarities were with long barrows along the Atlantic coast, perhaps imitating those of either Ireland or Brittany. The archaeologist Paul Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was &quot;impossible to indicate&quot; with the available evidence.

==Design and construction ==

Rectangular in shape, Addington Long Barrow is on a northeast to southwest alignment. In 1950, Evans described the monument as having twenty-two sarsen stones, eight of which, at the northeast end, would have originally formed the burial chamber. In 1981, investigators from Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit expanded that number, identifying twenty-five sarsens in the monument. Given the dimensions of the chambered tomb, they suggested that it probably once included about fifty stones.

Upon construction, the barrow would have been about long. The sides would have been straight but the monument tapered in width from at its eastern end to at its western end. It thus formed a &quot;truncated wedge-shape&quot;. The earthen tumulus currently stands at about in height, although would have been much taller when first created. Evans described the tumulus as having been &quot;of immense size&quot;, believing that the long barrow would have been &quot;a most imposing structure&quot; when built. No evidence has been found of ditches formed by quarrying for the earth to form the mound.

A stone chamber was set within the northeastern end of the long barrow, although it had been pulled down at some point in the monument&#x27;s history, while much of the mound was left standing. Jessup suggested that this chamber had been a false portal, an architectural feature resembling a doorway but which does not allow entry to the tomb, an idea supported by Daniel.

===Meaning and purpose===

Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic communities placed greater emphasis on the ritual burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears. Archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic Britons adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. The archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs, the Medway Megaliths were &quot;communal monuments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them&quot;. Thus, it has been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered Copythe tombs—which doubled as temples or shrines—to perform rituals honouring the dead and requesting their assistance. For this reason, the historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of various landscape markers that conveyed information on &quot;territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors&quot;. Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines were territorial markers between different tribes; others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. The archaeologist Richard Bradley suggested that the construction of these monuments reflects an attempt to mark control and ownership over the land, thus reflecting a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

==Later history==

===Destruction===

All the surviving megalithic tombs from the Early Neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the ravages of agriculture. Following the demolition of the tomb&#x27;s chamber, some of the sarsens around Addington Long Barrow had been buried, while others had been left visible. Various buildings in Addington are partly made of sarsen stone, some perhaps removed from the long barrow. Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from the monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.

Claims that people in the Middle Ages deliberately dug into and damaged the long barrows have been made for other Medway Megaliths, including Smythe&#x27;s Megalith, Chestnuts Long Barrow, Lower Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Coldrum Long Barrow, and Addington Long Barrow. Ashbee suggested that this destruction was probably due to iconoclasm, believing that the burial of the stones likely indicated that medieval Christian zealots had tried to deliberately destroy and defame the pre-Christian monument.

Conversely, the archaeologist John Alexander believed that this damage resulted from a robbery by medieval treasure hunters. Supporting this idea is comparative evidence, with the Close Roll of 1237 ordering the opening of barrows on the Isle of Wight in search for treasure, a practice that may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the &quot;expertness and thoroughness of the robbery&quot;—as evidenced at Chestnuts—would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce.

===Folklore and folk tradition===

When Thomas Wright investigated the site in about 1850, he was aided by a local man who believed that a crock of gold would be unearthed there.

In a 1946 paper published in the &quot;Folklore&quot; journal, John H. Evans recorded a Kentish folk belief which had been widespread &quot;Up to the last generation&quot;; this was that it was impossible for any human being to successfully count the number of stones in the Medway Megaliths. The countless stones motif is not unique to Kent but has been recorded at other megalithic monuments in Britain and Ireland. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although an early 17th-century document also applied it to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation==

The antiquarian John Harris mentioned Addington Long Barow in his &quot;History of Kent&quot;, published posthumously in 1719. He noted that the area where the barrow stood was known locally as &quot;the Warren&quot;, and that an &quot;old clerk&quot; informed him that an oak tree had formerly grown in the centre of the stones. The monument was next recorded by the antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in a short article for &quot;Archaeologia&quot;, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1773. Aided by the minister of the parish, the Reverend Buttonshaw, Colebooke enquired among elderly locals as to whether they knew of the oak tree mentioned by Harris, but none had. Colebrooke believed that the Britons had retreated to near Addington after their defeat at the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, and that it was here that they buried their military leader, Categern. The later archaeologist John H. Evans described Colebrooke&#x27;s descriptions and drawings as &quot;almost completely worthless&quot; because the antiquarian mistook the rectangular chambered tomb for a stone circle. Colebrook&#x27;s analysis was echoed in the 18th-century writings of Samuel Pegge, Edward Hasted, and John Thorpe.

In 1827, the road passing through the tomb was widened and deepened. To achieve this, workmen removed two of the sarsens from the revetment kerb and placed them in the corner of the wood to the south of the monument. In the early 1840s, the Reverend Beale Post conducted investigations into the Medway Megaliths, writing them up in a manuscript that was left unpublished; this included Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow, which he collectively labelled the &quot;Addington Circles&quot;. Thomas Wright recorded that in 1845 a local parson, the Reverend Lambert Blackwell Larking, dug into a chamber at Addington, discovering &quot;fragments of rude pottery&quot;. From the context in which Wright wrote, it seems that Addington Long Barrow is referred to, although it remains possible that Chestnuts was the barrow in question. In the early 1860s, Charles Roach Smith visited the site alongside Charles Warne and Charles Moore Jessop, the latter of whom described it as a &quot;Celtic&quot; monument in a subsequent article for &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

In 1871, Edwin Dunkin published a basic plan of the monument, noting that there were similar chambered tombs around Britain. In 1880, the archaeologist Flinders Petrie included the Addington stones in his list of Kentish earthworks; he commented that &quot;with extraordinary perversity [they] have been hitherto described as forming a circle, though they appear to be very plainly in two lines&quot;. He published a small, basic plan of the monument. The barrow then received a mention in George Payne&#x27;s &quot;Collectanea Cantiana&quot;, published in 1893. Payne noted a folk tradition that stone avenues connected Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although he commented that he was unable to discover any evidence of this feature. The earliest published photographs of the monument, taken by George Clinch, appeared in a 1908 volume of the &quot;Victoria County History&quot; series. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Addington Long Barrow alongside the other Medway Megaliths.

Ronald Jessup included the Addington site in his 1970 book, &quot;South East England&quot;, there describing it as &quot;mostly overgrown&quot;. In 1981, members of the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit conducted a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted that he had found evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. In May 2007, the archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the current landowner pointed out to him an area where the road was subsiding. Philp alerted Kent County Council, who arranged for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen. Comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.

<doc id="827245" wikidata="Q4329865" url="?curid=827245" title="Encumbrance">
<text>An encumbrance is a third party&#x27;s right to, interest in, or legal liability on property that does not prohibit the property&#x27;s owner from transferring title (but may diminish its value). Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (for example, liens) or non-financial (for example, easements, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (for example, lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the encumbered property (for example, restrictions, easements, encroachments). Encumbrances include security interests, liens, servitudes (for example, easements, wayleaves, real covenants, profits a prendre), leases, restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights.

==Jurisdictions==

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, there is a statutory definition of &quot;encumbrance&quot;. In Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap. 219) it reads: &quot;&quot;&quot;encumbrance&quot; (產權負擔) includes a legal and equitable mortgage, a trust for securing money, a lien, a charge of a portion, annuity, or other capital or annual sum; and &quot;encumbrancer&quot; (產權負擔人) has a meaning corresponding with that of &quot;encumbrance&quot; and includes every person entitled to the benefit of an encumbrance, or to require payment and discharge thereof&quot;&quot;.

==Other uses==

===Colleges===
It is also a term used by colleges and universities to describe limitations placed on a student&#x27;s account due to late payment, late registration, or other reasons stated by the institution. An encumbrance can prohibit students from registering for classes, affect the release of their transcripts, or delay the reception of their diplomas.

===Accounting===
In management accounting, &quot;encumbrance&quot; is a management tool used to reflect commitments in the accounting system and attempt to prevent overspending. Encumbrances allow organizations to recognize future commitments of resources prior to an actual expenditure. The term is frequently used in fund accounting, especially among governmental entities.

;Pre-encumbrance: Amount expected to spend, but for which there is no legal obligation to spend. A requisition is a typical pre-encumbrance transaction.
;Encumbrance: Amount for which there is a legal obligation to spend in the future. A purchase order is a typical encumbrance transaction. At this point, the amount of the encumbrance will be entered in the financial records.
;Expenditure: Amount for which there has been an expenditure of funds. An expenditure is recorded in Commitment Control for both vouchers payable and journal entries. The encumbrance will be removed from the records when the expenditure is recorded.

=== Intellectual property ===

<text>The Piazza di Spagna is a square in the centre of Rome, the capital of Italy. It lies at the foot of the Spanish Steps and owes its name to the Palazzo di Spagna, the seat of the Embassy of Spain to the Holy See. The Column of the Immaculate Conception is in the square.

==The square==
In the middle of the square is the Fontana della Barcaccia, dating to the beginning of the Baroque period, sculpted by Pietro Bernini and his son Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

At the right corner of the Spanish Steps rises the house of the English poet John Keats, who lived there until his death in 1821: it is now a museum dedicated to him and his friend Percy Bysshe Shelley, displaying books and memorabilia of English romanticism. At the left corner, there is the Babington&#x27;s tea room, founded in 1893.

The side near Via Frattina is overlooked by the two façades (the main one, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, and the side one created by Francesco Borromini) of the Palazzo di Propaganda Fide, a property of the Holy See. In front of it, actually in a part of Piazza di Spagna named Piazza Mignanelli, rises the Column of the Immaculate Conception, erected in 1856, two years after the proclamation of the dogma.

The streets connecting to the square are known for their luxury shopping stores.

<doc id="827261" wikidata="Q6998616" url="?curid=827261" title="Netaji Palkar">
<text>Netoji Palkar (1620–1681), also known as Netaji Palkar, served as a prominent Maratha general and held the esteemed position of the 2nd Senapati of the Maratha Army under the leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the visionary founder of the Maratha empire. He was also known as Prati-Shivaji (mr:प्रतिशिवाजी ; meaning Like-Shivaji) implying someone embodying traits or ideals similar to Shivaji Maharaj.

==Background==
Netoji Palkar was born in the small village of Chouk in Khalapur, Maharashtra, India, into a Marathi Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family. Netaji&#x27;s father held a prominent position as a major Jagirdar in Western Maharashtra under the Adil Shahi dynasty.

==Military Career==
Netoji was appointed as Senapati in 1657, following the demise of Mankoji Dahatonde. Throughout the period of Shivaji&#x27;s ascendancy from 1645 to 1665, Netaji was entrusted with the leadership of numerous expeditions, all of which he executed with remarkable success. His most notable achievement was the campaign against the Adilshah of the Bijapur Sultanate, which ensued after the assassination of Afzal Khan. His reputation among the local populace was so profound that he earned the moniker &quot;Prati Shivaji,&quot; signifying his embodiment of the image of Chhatrapati Shivaji. 

He significantly disrupted the Mughal territories until the year 1665, and his failure to communicate the actions of Jai Singh and Dilerkhan left Shivaji deeply disappointed. Following the Treaty of Purandar in 1665, between Jai Singh and Shivaji, Shivaji was compelled to relinquish control of 23 forts to the Mughals and engage in hostilities against the Adilshah of Bijapur. During this period, Netaji Palkar switched allegiance to the forces of Adilshah, a strategic move orchestrated by Chhatrapati Shivaji to diminish his own military strength, as Aurangzeb sought Shivaji&#x27;s support in his campaigns. Consequently, Shivaji&#x27;s maneuvering successfully prevented the Mughals from subduing Adilshah, in line with his intended outcome.

After Shivaji&#x27;s meeting with Aurangzeb in Agra, Netaji Palkar joined the service of Jai Singh. Subsequently, when Shivaji managed to escape from Agra, Mirza Raja fell out of favor with Aurangzeb.

==Arrest and Conversion==
After Shivaji&#x27;s escape from Agra, Aurangzeb, seeking retribution, issued an order to Jai Singh to apprehend Netaji Palkar. Netaji Palkar was subsequently detained at Dharur Fort for a brief period. It is also recorded that during this time, Jijabai, Chhatrapati Shivaji&#x27;s mother, sent funds to Jai Singh in response to Shivaji&#x27;s request for distributing sweets in Agra. Netaji Palkar, eventually, underwent a conversion to Islam. His wives were later transported to Delhi and similarly underwent conversion, enabling Netaji to remarry them according to Islamic customs. Assuming the name of Muhammad Quli Khan, Netaji Palkar was appointed as the garrison commander of Kandahar Fort in Afghanistan. His attempt to escape was ultimately foiled, leading to his capture in Lahore. Subsequently, on the battlefields of Kandahar and Kabul, he fought on behalf of the Mughals against insurgent Pashtuns, thus earning the trust and favor of Aurangzeb. This resulted in his deployment to the Deccan, along with Commander Diler Khan, with the aim of subduing Shivaji&#x27;s territories.

After arriving in Deccan, Netaji joined forces with Shivaji&#x27;s troops and traveled to Raigad. Consequently, following a decade of captivity under the Mughal rule, Netaji presented himself at the court of Chhatrapati Shivaji, requesting reintegration into the Hindu faith. He underwent a formal re-conversion to Hinduism by the orders of Shivaji. After 1666, he retired from involvement in the Maratha campaigns. In 1665, the position of Senapati was bestowed upon Prataprao Gujar.

==Death==
He died in 1681, due to natural causes associated with old age in Tamsa village, Nanded.

<text>Tibouchina is a neotropical flowering plant genus in the family Melastomataceae. Species of this genus are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees and typically have purple flowers. They are native to Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America where they are found as far south as northern Argentina. Members of this genus are known as glory bushes, glory trees or princess flowers. The name &quot;Tibouchina&quot; is adapted from a Guianan indigenous name for a member of this genus. A systematic study in 2013 showed that as then circumscribed the genus was paraphyletic, and in 2019 the genus was split into a more narrowly circumscribed &quot;Tibouchina&quot;, two re-established genera &quot;Pleroma&quot; and &quot;Chaetogastra&quot;, and a new genus, &quot;Andesanthus&quot;.

== Description ==
&quot;Tibouchina&quot; species are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees. Their leaves are opposite, usually with petioles, and often covered with scales. The inflorescence is a panicle or some modification of a panicle with reduced branching. The individual flowers have five free petals, purple or lilac in color; the color does not change as the flowers age. There are ten stamens, either all the same or dimorphic, with five larger and five smaller ones. The connective tissue below the anthers of the stamens is prolonged and modified at the base of the stamens into ventrally bilobed appendages. When mature, the seeds are contained in a dry, semiwoody capsule and are cochleate (spiralled).
== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Tibouchina&quot; was established by Aublet in 1775 in his Flora of French Guiana with the description of a single species, &quot;T. aspera&quot;, which is thus the type species. In 1885, in his treatment for &quot;Flora brasiliensis&quot;, Alfred Cogniaux used a broad concept of the genus, transferring into it many of the species at that time placed in &quot;Chaetogastra&quot;, &quot;Diplostegium&quot;, &quot;Lasiandra&quot;, &quot;Pleroma&quot; and &quot;Purpurella&quot;, among others. This broad concept was generally adopted subsequently, and around 470 taxa were at one time or another assigned to &quot;Tibouchina&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
A phylogenetic analysis in 2013 based on molecular data (2 plastid and 1 nuclear regions) determined that the traditional circumscription of &quot;Tibouchina&quot; was paraphyletic. Four major clades were resolved within the genus which were supported by morphological, molecular and geographic evidence. Based on the traditional code of nomenclature, the clade that the type species falls in retains the name of the genus; therefore, the clade containing &quot;Tibouchina aspera&quot; remains &quot;Tibouchina&quot;.

A further molecular phylogenetic study in 2019 used the same molecular markers but included more species. It reached the same conclusion: the original broadly circumscribed &quot;Tibouchina&quot; consisted of four monophyletic clades. The authors proposed a split into four genera: a more narrowly circumscribed &quot;Tibouchina&quot;, two re-established genera &quot;Pleroma&quot; and &quot;Chaetogastra&quot;, and a new genus, &quot;Andesanthus&quot;. The relationship between &quot;Chaetogastra&quot; and the genus &quot;Brachyotum&quot; differed between a maximum likelihood analysis and a Bayesian inference analysis: the former found &quot;Brachyotum&quot; embedded within &quot;Chaetogastra&quot;, the latter found the two to be sisters. The part of their maximum likelihood cladogram which includes former &quot;Tibouchina&quot; species is as follows, using their genus names and with shading added to show the original broadly circumscribed &quot;Tibouchina&quot; s.l.:

As re-circumscribed, &quot;Tibouchina&quot; is monophyletic and contains species belonging to the traditional sections &quot;T.&quot; section &quot;Tibouchina&quot; and &quot;T.&quot; section &quot;Barbigerae&quot;. Diagnostic characteristics include the presence of scale-like trichomes on the hypanthium and leaves and a long pedoconnective on lilac anthers, and the absence of glandular trichomes. Species are found in savanna habitats.

== Distribution and invasive potential ==
All the species of &quot;Tibouchina&quot; are native to the Americas as far north as Mexico south to northern Argentina, with many found in Brazil, and others in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Members of &quot;Tibouchina&quot; tend to be found in lowland savannas and on the lower slopes of the Andes. All &quot;Tibouchina&quot; species as well as those formerly placed in the genus are considered noxious weeds in Hawaii, because of their high potential for being invasive species. Many species, such as &quot;T. araguaiensis&quot;, &quot;T. papyrus&quot;, &quot;T. mathaei&quot; and &quot;T. nigricans&quot;, have narrow distributions, being known from only a handful of locations, while a few other species, including &quot;T. aspera&quot;, &quot;T. barbigera&quot; and &quot;T. bipenicillata&quot;, have broader distributions.

<text>Arthur Ernest Tiffin OBE (11 February 1896 – 27 December 1955), commonly known as Jock Tiffin or A. E. Tiffin, was the third general secretary of the British Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (TGWU). He served for only a few months in 1955 before his death.

Tiffin was born in Carlisle. After leaving Bishop Creighton School, he became a clerk on the London and North Western Railway, he joined the Foot Guards when the First World War broke out, later transferring to the Royal Artillery. He was wounded and invalided home, where army doctors advised him to find a more active occupation than his previous office job in order to improve his health. In 1919, therefore, he became a bus driver for the London General Omnibus Company. A trade unionist since 1912, he joined the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and rose rapidly through the ranks. In 1930, he was given the job of organising the workers on the company&#x27;s new Green Line services throughout London and the Home counties and two years later he became a full-time union officer as Outer London Passenger Organiser. In 1940 he became the Area Organiser of Area No.1 (London and South East). He also served for seven years as chairman of the London Trades Council, struggling in vain against its domination by Communists (which eventually led to its disbandment by the Trades Union Congress (TUC)), and for four years as chairman of the London Labour Party. During the Second World War he commanded a Home Guard battalion and was TUC representative on the Territorial Army Advisory Committee.

In 1948, he was appointed assistant general secretary of the TGWU in succession to Harold Clay. In 1949, he was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1951.

In 1955, while elections were underway for his successor, general secretary Arthur Deakin died suddenly and Tiffin took over as acting general secretary. Later that year he was officially elected to the post, beating Charles Brandon, who had previously been his superior as area secretary of Area No.1, as well as Frank Cousins, Tom Hodgson, Harry Nicholas, and Bill Tudor. Three or four months after taking office Tiffin became seriously ill and died after just over six months as general secretary. He was succeeded by Frank Cousins, who had replaced him as assistant general secretary and acted as general secretary during his illness. Tiffin&#x27;s short period of office was troubled by a dock strike and a dispute between the TGWU and the National Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers.

<doc id="827273" wikidata="Q779970" url="?curid=827273" title="Imposition">
<text>Imposition is one of the fundamental steps in the prepress printing process. It consists of the arrangement of the printed product&#x27;s pages on the printer&#x27;s sheet, in order to obtain faster printing, simplify binding and reduce paper waste.

Correct imposition minimizes printing time by maximizing the number of pages per impression, reducing cost of press time and materials. To achieve this, the printed sheet must be filled as fully as possible.

== Task ==

The arrangement of pages on the printer&#x27;s sheet is affected by five different parameters:
* Format of the product: The size of the finished page determines how many pages can be printed on a single sheet.
* Number of pages of the printed product: The compositor must determine how many sheets are to be printed to create a finished book.
* Stitching/binding method: The compositor must understand how the sheets are placed to form the signatures that compose the finished book.
* Paper fiber direction: Many papers have a &quot;grain,&quot; reflecting the alignment of the paper fibers. These fibers must run lengthwise along the fold, which influences the alignment, hence the position, of the pages on the printed sheet.
* Finishing and binding

To understand how the pages are related to each other, an imposition dummy may be used. This is made by folding several sheets of paper in the way the press will print and fold the product. A little copy is then created, and this can help paginate the product.
In the example above, a 16-page book is prepared for printing. There are eight pages on the front of the sheet, and the corresponding eight pages on the back. After printing, the paper is folded in half vertically (page two falls against page three). Then it is folded again horizontally (page four meets page five). A third fold completes this process (page nine meets page eight). The example below shows the final result prior to binding and trimming.
== Non-digital techniques ==
Imposition has been a requirement since the earliest days of printing. When pages were set using movable type, pages were assembled in a metal frame called a &quot;chase&quot;, and locked into place using wedges called &quot;quoins&quot;.

By the late twentieth century, most typesetting was onto photographic film. These sheets were combined manually on a light table, in a process called &quot;stripping&quot;. Skilled workers would spend many hours &quot;stripping&quot; pieces of film together in the correct sequence and orientation. The term stripping was also used for other changes to a prepared page, such as a spelling correction, or a &quot;stop press&quot; story in a newspaper. Digital techniques rendered stripping less necessary, but what has forced increasing numbers to abandon it completely is the introduction of &quot;platesetters&quot;, which put pages directly onto printing plates; these plates cannot be adjusted with a sharp knife. In addition, an extremely high precision would be needed for stripping of colour work, as each ink colour is on a separate piece of film.

== Digital techniques ==
Manual imposition processes tend to cause bottlenecks of the whole printing production. The first digital imposition software, Impostrip, was released in 1989. The advent of digital imposition has not only helped a lot in making sure layout and sheet arrangement are correct with higher register precision, but it significantly reduces the usual imposition errors (e.g., slight movements of register due to parallax). An entire book may be &quot;imposed&quot; and many complex functions applied in an instant. Binding options may be changed on the fly and impositions produced to multiple output devices at once, often with no user intervention. In turn, digital techniques help to reduce material costs, time and resolves production bottlenecks. There are several different approaches to digital imposition.

* Imposition in the design application. Software packages that can be used to design single pages can often be used to design entire printed sheets, sometimes by a process as simple as copy/paste onto a larger sheet. This is still in use, especially for low volumes of work, but a popular alternative is an imposition function built in, or added in, to the design tool. This typically takes a document prepared as single pages and creates a new document with full-sheet layouts. This larger layout is then printed to film or a plate.
* Imposition through shell scripts and operating system features. This approach works particularly well on desktop Unix in a small office/home office environment (where a printer may only be capable of handling A3 and smaller). A trivial script might be written to re-arrange pages in a PostScript or PDF file to make them suitable for final imposition through the built-in &quot;Page Setup&quot;. 
** For the imposition of an A4-sized hardcover book on A3 paper, for example, one could first write a shell script to re-arrange the document in the following sequence: 1, 32, 31, 2, 3, 30, 29, 4... 33, 64, 63, 34, 35, 62, 61, 36... Then, using &quot;Page Setup&quot; or &quot;Print&quot; (under the File menu) one could print two pages per sheet, double-sided. The result could then be folded in half along the width, arranged as 8-sheet signatures, sewn, and bound.
* Post-design imposition. A post-design application might take a PostScript or PDF file in single pages and produce a new PostScript or PDF file with imposed sheet layouts for printing. A variation of this is to take a large number of single-page source files as input. This is especially suitable for a magazine or newspaper, where pages may be worked on by different groups simultaneously.
* Print driver imposition. Some printer drivers enable the source application&#x27;s single-page printed output to be sent to the printer as full sheets. This is not often found in professional production, but is popular for such things as booklet printing on office laser printers. A variation of this offers the ability to print layouts as an option in the application.
* Output device imposition. This is sometimes called &quot;in-RIP imposition&quot;. This allows regular pages to be printed by any suitable means, and the output device handles imposition. While this offers the advantage of enabling specific tuning of the imposition for an output device, the cost is that there is no preview until the output is produced. This may mean a costly printing plate that takes some time to produce, or even (with a digital press) errors in finished copies: expensive mistakes are possible.

Where an imposition layout is viewed on screen, it may be referred to as a printer&#x27;s spread. This is used to contrast with reader&#x27;s spread, which shows a finished printed piece on screen as it will appear to the reader, rather than the printer; specifically, in a reader&#x27;s spread for a typical book, pairs of facing pages are shown side-by-side (that is, pages 2 and 3 together).

== Imposition proof ==
The imposition proof is the last test that is performed before beginning the print run.

This test is performed to verify, through the formation of a prototype, that the imposition was successful. Typical checks are that the pages are on the correct spot and the crossover bleeds work. It cannot be used as a check proof for images or colors or layout because it is printed on a large, low-resolution inkjet printer.

Since the inkjet printer can print on only one side of the paper, the full proof (the front and rear sides) is printed on two separate sheets. They are first cut along the crossover bleeds, checking to see if they are in the correct position. The two sheets are then attached together to form a single sheet printed on both sides, and then this sheet is folded to form a prototype of the signature.

This proof is still called blue copy, digital blue copy to prototype, or blues plotter.

<doc id="827291" wikidata="Q2078163" url="?curid=827291" title="Ring roads of Beijing">
<text>Beijing possesses multiple ring roads.

== Layout ==
Beijing&#x27;s road structure is influenced by the historical development patterns of its inner city, focused on the Forbidden City.

The first through fourth ring roads of Beijing are generally symmetrical and square. Its outer ring roads are generally more circular.

==1st Ring Road==
When the city of Beijing had tram lines in operation from the 1920s to the 1950s, Line No. 4&#x27;s route formed a ring-shaped loop, running 17-km clockwise through Tiananmen - Xidan - Xisi - Ping&#x27;anli - Dianmen - Gulou - Jiaodaokou - Beixinqiao - Dongsi - Dongdan - Tiananmen. This route was known as the &quot;Ring Road&quot; (環形路). After the tramlines were removed in the 1950s, this name lost its meaning as it was simply a collection of surface streets (in contrast, each of the other ring roads today is a single expressway). Plans in 1954 and 1957 show a different &quot;1st Ring Road&quot;, a slightly larger rectangular loop between Beixinqiao - Ciqikou - Caishikou - Xinjiekou. Most maps in Beijing do not actually show the 1st Ring Road as such; only very few maps give a faint yellow highlight of a possible variant of it. However, the original name remained to be used later for other ring roads constructed decades later.

The notion of &quot;1st Ring Road&quot; briefly reappeared after the end of the Cultural Revolution, during which the original names of the roads described above were changed to names with strong political propaganda meaning that eulogized and advocated the ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, and when the political turmoil had ended, the names changed. One suggestion was to completely rename those roads as &quot;1st Ring Road&quot; to symbolize the new start in the era of reform, as well as to reflect the willingness of China to embrace modernness and globalization, but this suggestion was quickly turned down because most people favored the original names of the roads and believed in their historical meaning and cultural heritage, and more importantly, they felt that returning the original names also had more symbolic meaning of denouncing Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the original names of the roads were adopted once again, and the phrase &quot;1st Ring Road&quot; was seldom heard again.

==2nd Ring Road==

Beijing&#x27;s &quot;first&quot; (innermost) ring road, the 2nd Ring Road was built in the 1980s and expanded in the 1990s. It now forms a rectangular loop around central Beijing, an area that is roughly equivalent to the old city, which includes the four districts: Dongcheng District, Xicheng District, Xuanwu District and Chongwen District. Its four sections begin at Xizhimen, Dongzhimen, Caihuying and Zuo&#x27;anmen.

The 2nd Ring Road passes through very central parts of Beijing, and runs almost directly past the Beijing North railway station and Beijing railway station. Prices of real estate inside the ring road are considerably higher than other parts of the city.

The 2nd Ring Road of today is part of an extended ring road which takes the southern route through Zuo&#x27;anmen and Caihuying instead of Qianmen Road, just south of Tian&#x27;anmen. Its southernmost part between Jianguomen and Fuxingmen appears &quot;squashed&quot; outwards. The 2nd ring is directly connected to the Airport Expressway and Badaling Expressway.

==3rd Ring Road==

The 3rd Ring Road was built in the 1980s and completed in the 1990s. It is by no means peripheral, as it passes through Beijing&#x27;s Central business district and diplomatic communities (Dongzhimenwai / Liangmaqiao, Jianguomenwai). It is directly interlinked with numerous expressways—the Jingcheng Expressway, the Jingshi Expressway, the Jingkai Expressway, and the Jingjintang Expressway.

==4th Ring Road==

The 4th Ring Road was completed in 2001, around from the center of Beijing. It connects the less central parts of Beijing and navigates through Zhongguancun technology hub, western Beijing, Fengtai District, and eastern Beijing. The Jingshen Expressway and the Jingtong Expressway (as of Dawangqiao) begin from the 4th Ring Road.

The 4th Ring Road, along with other ring roads, now have a few locations where &quot;fake&quot; police lights (red and blue in colour) light up at night. Drivers are easily fooled into thinking that the police is out in force. This indirectly forces drivers to slow down.

==5th Ring Road==
The 5th Ring Road is, along with the 6th Ring Road, a full expressway ring road. It is designated as a provincial expressway with number S50.

This ring road is further distant (around ) from central Beijing, and links the suburban areas of Huantie, Shigezhuang, Dingfuzhuang and Ciqu. It also passes through the Yizhuang Development Area. It navigates through very barren land in the south before heading west toward the Fragrant Hills.

Due to its proximity to Olympic venues, it has been nicknamed the &quot;Olympic Avenue&quot;.
Also there is a comical Chinese song about the rings of Beijing. known as the Song of the 5th Ring Road.

==6th Ring Road==

At present the most remote ring road from central Beijing (around ), the 6th Ring Road was built in the 2000s and was completed in 2010. of expressway between the interchanges with Badaling Expressway and Jingshi Expressway, running clockwise, are open to general motor traffic. It is the only ring road to be interlinked with the equally remote Jingha Expressway.

This toll expressway ring road links Beijing with Shunyi District, Tongzhou District, Changping District and Daxing District. It is included in the National Trunk Highway System and planned as a branch of G45 Daqing–Guangzhou Expressway, and henceforth receives the designation G4501.

==7th Ring Road==
The G95 Capital Area Loop Expressway, also unofficially known as the 7th Ring Road, is an orbital road of about 1,000 km that encircles the city centre of Beijing, mostly passing through Hebei. Only 38 kilometers passes through Beijing, another 38 km runs through Tianjin and 924 km is in Hebei province. Construction of the road was completed in June 2018 with the final section linking Beijing&#x27;s outer districts of Tongzhou and Daxing.

== Others ==
China National Highway 112 is a ring road which runs around Beijing through province of Hebei and municipality of Tianjin, completely outside of Beijing municipality. Although not popularly known as part of Beijing&#x27;s &quot;ring road system&quot;, it has been informally identified as the &quot;8th Ring Road&quot; by some road-trip fans.

==Inter-ring road connection routes==

There also exist many connection routes between the ring roads. The ones listed below are all expressways or express routes. Travel on these routes is often surprisingly smooth, as there are no traffic lights on them.

11 routes are under construction as of 2004.

* Xueyuan Road (N. 4th Ring Road - N. 5th Ring Road, under projection)
* Badaling Expressway (as of N. 2nd Ring Road, expressway as of N. 3rd Ring Road, constructed)

<doc id="827294" wikidata="Q1929728" url="?curid=827294" title="File eXchange Protocol">
<text>File eXchange Protocol (FXP or FXSP) is a method of data transfer which uses FTP to transfer data from one remote server to another (inter-server) without routing this data through the client&#x27;s connection. Conventional FTP involves a single server and a single client; all data transmission is done between these two. In the FXP session, a client maintains a standard FTP connection to two servers, and can direct either server to connect to the other to initiate a data transfer. The advantage of using FXP over FTP is evident when a high-bandwidth server demands resources from another high-bandwidth server, but only a low-bandwidth client, such as a network administrator working away from location, has the authority to access the resources on both servers.

==Risk==
Enabling FXP(.RVL) support can make a server vulnerable to an exploit known as FTP bounce. As a result of this, FTP server software often has FXP disabled by default. Some sites restrict IP addresses to trusted sites to limit this risk.

==FXP over SSL==
Some FTP Servers such as glFTPd, cuftpd, RaidenFTPD, drftpd, and wzdftpd support negotiation of a secure data channel between two servers using either of the FTP protocol extension commands; CPSV or SSCN. This normally works by the client issuing CPSV in lieu of the PASV command—or by sending SSCN prior to PASV transfers—which instructs the server to create either a SSL or TLS connection. However, both methods—CPSV and SSCN—may be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, if the two FTP servers do not verify each other&#x27;s SSL certificates. SSCN was first introduced by RaidenFTPD and SmartFTP in 2003 and has been widely adopted.

==Technical==
Although FXP is often considered a distinct protocol, it is in fact merely an extension of the FTP protocol and is specified in :

 User-PI - Server A (Dest) User-PI - Server B (Source)
 
 C-&gt;A : Connect C-&gt;B : Connect
 C-&gt;A : PASV
 A-&gt;C : 227 Entering Passive Mode. A1,A2,A3,A4,a1,a2
 C-&gt;B : PORT A1,A2,A3,A4,a1,a2
 B-&gt;C : 200 Okay
 C-&gt;A : STOR C-&gt;B : RETR

 B-&gt;A : Connect to HOST-A, PORT-a

==References==

This &quot;protocol&quot; is standardized as a subset of RFC 959 by the IETF as:

* File Transfer Protocol (FTP). J. Postel, J. Reynolds. Oct-1985. This obsoleted the preceding and earlier FTP RFCs back to the original .

<text>South Tottenham is a railway station on the Suffragette line of the London Overground. It is located on the eastern side of the A10 High Road in Tottenham, North London, from (measured via Kentish Town and Mortimer Street Junction) and situated between and . It is in Zone 3, in the London Borough of Haringey.

South Tottenham to station (on the Weaver line of the London Overground and the Victoria line of the London Underground) is considered an official out-of-station interchange by the National Rail timetable, and involves a short walk. This link will become fixed under the planned route for Crossrail 2, which sees a double-ended underground station built linking together South Tottenham and Seven Sisters stations.
== History ==

Opened as &#x27;South Tottenham and Stamford Hill&#x27; station on 1 May 1871, on the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, it was renamed &#x27;South Tottenham&#x27; in 1949.

== The station today ==

A short distance west of the station, on the far side of the A10, there is a single east-to-north spur towards Seven Sisters. To allow this to be reached by westbound trains, there is a facing crossover, located in the platform area.

A short distance to the east of the station, there is a double turnout branching to the south, to reach the eastern route of the two north–south Lea Valley Lines. Visually from the platforms, this looks like it is the main line, since the main tracks curve to the north from the junction. (In fact, it &quot;was&quot; the original main line, since the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway eastwards was a later addition.)

Both curves were formerly part of the route used by trains on the Palace Gates Line (which then continued onwards to ) but these days see infrequent use, with just one booked London Overground train, which travels between Liverpool Street and via and Seven Sisters, in one direction only. This surviving parliamentary train does not however stop at South Tottenham. As of September 2023, this service is still running.

The station has been receiving investment, following station management passing to London Overground in 2007.

==Connections==
The station is served by London Buses routes 76, 149, 243, 318, 349, 476 and night route N73.

==Services==

All services at South Tottenham are operated by London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour in each direction between and . During the late evenings, the service is reduced to three trains per hour in each direction.

<text>Globe is a supermarket tabloid based in Boca Raton, Florida. It covers politics, celebrity, human interest, and crime stories, largely employing sensationalist tabloid journalism. It was established in Montreal, Quebec in 1954.

==History==
&quot;Globe&quot; was first published in North America on November 10, 1954, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, as Midnight, as a &quot;bi-weekly ... devoted to Montreal night life&quot;, by Sunday Express″s Joe Azaria&lt;ref name=&quot;macleans.ca-1963/9/21-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macleans.ca-1966/10/15-azaria&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who later hired John Vader, and Colin Gravenor.

During the 1960s, &quot;Midnight&quot; became the chief competitor to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;.

In 1978, it changed its name to the Midnight Globe after its publisher, Globe Communications, and eventually to &quot;Globe&quot;. 

In 1999, American Media bought parent Globe Communications.

Circa 1991, &quot;Globe&quot; caused controversy by publishing the name of the accuser in the William Kennedy Smith rape case.

&quot;Globe&quot; caused controversy by publishing the transcribed tapes of Frank Gifford&#x27;s affair at a New York City hotel, cheating on his wife, Kathie Lee Gifford.
In mid-November 1995, &quot;Globe&quot; caused controversy by publishing Tejana singer Selena Quintanilla-Perez&#x27;s autopsy photos, causing retailers in her home region of South Texas to pull and dispose of that edition of the tabloid. 

In 1997, &quot;Globe&quot; caused controversy by publishing autopsy photos of JonBenét Ramsey, causing retailers in her home region of Boulder, Colorado to pull that edition, though one local retailer retained stock of that edition.
In 2001, the offices of American Media in Boca Raton, Florida, were attacked with anthrax. A photo editor with &quot;The Sun&quot;, a sister publication to Globe, died from exposure to it, and the building was sealed for three years.

In 2003, &quot;Globe&quot; caused controversy by publishing the name of Kobe Bryant&#x27;s accuser and putting her picture on its cover. Traditionally, media in the United States have refrained from revealing the names of alleged victims of sex crimes. &quot;Globe&quot; Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Rodack defended the magazine&#x27;s decision to publish her name in an article for the Poynter Journalism Institute.

On June 9, 2010, &quot;Globe&quot; caused controversy by publishing deathbed photos of Gary Coleman claiming the former child actor was murdered.

In 2013, it led the fight to try to save TV&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Globe&quot; was published out of American Media, Inc. headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, and Dylan Howard, oversaw publication.

On April 18, 2019, it was announced that American Media Inc. had agreed to sell &quot;Globe&quot; to Hudson Group.
On April 18, 2019, AMI agreed to sell &quot;Globe&quot; and also the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and &quot;National Examiner&quot; to Hudson Group.

&quot;Globe&quot; has a tendency to focus on more news and political-oriented content than its sister papers.

<text>South Quay is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station on the Isle of Dogs, East London, England. The station is between Crossharbour and Heron Quays stations and is in Travelcard Zone 2. South Quay is in Millwall and is located on the southern shore of the South Dock of the West India Docks; the current station platforms sit astride the channel connecting Millwall Dock to the West India Docks.

==History==
The original South Quay station opened in 1987 in Millwall and was a standard DLR phase 1 elevated station, subsequently extended to permit the use of 2 unit trains.

In 1996, near the station, the Docklands bombing killed 2 people and injured over 30. The IRA had claimed responsibility for it. A memorial plaque at the station was unveiled in December 2009, commemorating the victims of the 1996 bombing.

===Relocation===
The station was constrained by sharp curves at both ends and could not, therefore, be further extended on its former site. The DLR&#x27;s plan to operate 3 unit trains on this line therefore included the relocation of this station to a new site over Millwall Dock some distance to the east, resulting in the relocated station partly being in Cubitt Town.

In October 2004, Transport for London announced plans to close and replace South Quay station with a station at a new location because of increased use of the Docklands Light Railway. The reason for the move was that the platforms could only accommodate two-unit trains. They would need to be lengthened by thirty metres for three-unit trains but the curves either side of the station precluded extension work.

The new station, on a straight section of track to the east, opened on Monday 26 October 2009 with the old station closing on Friday 23 October.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from South Quay is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.


==Connections==
London Buses route D8 serves the station.

==Surrounding area==
South Quay is surrounded by commercial offices and residential developments and their for the residential, commercial and entertainment development in this part of Millwall. The highrise Pan Peninsula Towers is immediately adjacent to the station. A small shopping centre, South Quay Plaza, is across the road from the station. The Hilton London Canary Wharf hotel is also close to the station. Further afield, the southern shore of the South Dock of the West India Docks to the west of the station is lined with restaurants. The South Quay Footbridge provides a connection to the Canary Wharf private estate.

<doc id="827305" wikidata="Q7049223" url="?curid=827305" title="Noncommutative quantum field theory">
<text>In mathematical physics, noncommutative quantum field theory (or quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetime) is an application of noncommutative mathematics to the spacetime of quantum field theory that is an outgrowth of noncommutative geometry and index theory in which the coordinate functions are noncommutative. One commonly studied version of such theories has the &quot;canonical&quot; commutation relation:

:formula_1
where formula_2 and formula_3 are the hermitian generators of a noncommutative formula_4-algebra of &quot;functions on spacetime&quot;. That means that (with any given set of axes), it is impossible to accurately measure the position of a particle with respect to more than one axis. In fact, this leads to an uncertainty relation for the coordinates analogous to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Various lower limits have been claimed for the noncommutative scale, (i.e. how accurately positions can be measured) but there is currently no experimental evidence in favour of such a theory or grounds for ruling them out.

One of the novel features of noncommutative field theories is the UV/IR mixing phenomenon in which the physics at high energies affects the physics at low energies which does not occur in quantum field theories in which the coordinates commute.

Other features include violation of Lorentz invariance due to the preferred direction of noncommutativity. Relativistic invariance can however be retained in the sense of twisted Poincaré invariance of the theory. The causality condition is modified from that of the commutative theories.

==History and motivation==

Heisenberg was the first to suggest extending noncommutativity to the coordinates as a possible way of removing the infinite quantities appearing in field theories before the renormalization procedure was developed and had gained acceptance. The first paper on the subject was published in 1947 by Hartland Snyder. The success of the renormalization method resulted in little attention being paid to the subject for some time. In the 1980s, mathematicians, most notably Alain Connes, developed noncommutative geometry. Among other things, this work generalized the notion of differential structure to a noncommutative setting. This led to an operator algebraic description of noncommutative space-times, with the problem that it classically corresponds to a manifold with positively defined metric tensor, so that there is no description of (noncommutative) causality in this approach. However it also led to the development of a Yang–Mills theory on a noncommutative torus.

The particle physics community became interested in the noncommutative approach because of a paper by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten. They argued in the context of string theory that the coordinate functions of the endpoints of open strings constrained to a D-brane in the presence of a constant Neveu–Schwarz B-field—equivalent to a constant magnetic field on the brane—would satisfy the noncommutative algebra set out above. The implication is that a quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetime can be interpreted as a low energy limit of the theory of open strings.

Two papers, one by Sergio Doplicher, Klaus Fredenhagen and John Roberts 
and the other by D. V. Ahluwalia,
set out another motivation for the possible noncommutativity of space-time. 
The arguments go as follows: According to general relativity, when the energy density grows sufficiently large, a black hole is formed. On the other hand, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, a measurement of a space-time separation causes an uncertainty in momentum inversely proportional to the extent of the separation. Thus energy whose scale corresponds to the uncertainty in momentum is localized in the system within a region corresponding to the uncertainty in position. When the separation is small enough, the Schwarzschild radius of the system is reached and a black hole is formed, which prevents any information from escaping the system. Thus there is a lower bound for the measurement of length. A sufficient condition for preventing gravitational collapse can be expressed as an uncertainty relation for the coordinates. This relation can in turn be derived from a commutation relation for the coordinates.

It is worth stressing that, differently from other approaches, in particular those relying upon Connes&#x27; ideas, here the noncommutative spacetime is a proper spacetime, i.e. it extends the idea of a four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. On the other hand, differently from Connes&#x27; noncommutative geometry, the proposed model turns out to be coordinate-dependent from scratch.
In Doplicher Fredenhagen Roberts&#x27; paper noncommutativity of coordinates concerns all four spacetime coordinates and not only spatial ones.

<text>Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti (18 April 1791 – 20 March 1863) was an Italian physicist who was exiled from Italy for his liberal ideas. During the First Italian War of Independence he led a &quot;battalion of students&quot;, part of a delegation from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He later taught astronomy and physics at the University of Buenos Aires. His name is associated with a type of multiple-element lens for correcting spherical aberration and coma, but not chromatic aberration. His studies on dielectrics led to important results: the Clausius-Mossotti formula is partly named after him, and his views on dielectric behavior helped lead James Clerk Maxwell to devise his theory of the displacement current, which led in turn to the theoretical prediction of electromagnetic waves.

Mossotti was chair of experimental physics in Buenos Aires (1827–1835) and taught numerous Argentinian physicians his views on dielectrics, thereby becoming influential on the Argentine-German neurobiological tradition regarding electricity inside brain tissue. Later (after 1906) these views influenced this tradition&#x27;s models of stationary waves in the interference of neural activity for short-term memory. Mossotti later returned to Italy and participated in military actions while in his sixties, and was appointed as senator. In Italy Mossotti taught more than five hundred mathematical students. His work also influenced Hendrik Antoon Lorentz&#x27;s views on fundamental forces.

<doc id="827308" wikidata="Q1971670" url="?curid=827308" title="West India Quay DLR station">
<text>West India Quay is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Canary Wharf’s West India Quay. It is located at the point where the line from Lewisham splits into branches to Tower Gateway/Bank and Stratford. The next stations on each line are Canary Wharf DLR station (to Lewisham), Westferry (to Tower Gateway/Bank) and Poplar DLR station (to Stratford). The station is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==Location and connections==
West India Quay station is located over the northern half of the dock of the same name in southeast end of Limehouse and is very close to both Poplar and Canary Wharf, and is in the central portion of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Situated to the south of Billingsgate Road and Aspen Way (A1261), the station is near the edge of the main Docklands re-development area.
The distance from West India Quay DLR to Canary Wharf DLR is just , the shortest distance between stations on the entire London Underground and Docklands Light Railway system. Indeed, while standing at the station, the platforms for Canary Wharf are clearly visible just down the line, as is the following station Heron Quays station, from which Canary Wharf and West India Quay are also visible in the opposite direction.

West India Quay is the closest DLR station to the Canary Wharf railway station served by the Elizabeth line.

The station is not served by any London Buses Routes.

As of April 2017 DLR trains from Bank towards Lewisham do not stop at this station, meaning to reach here from the City of London passengers must travel on to Canary Wharf and get the next train in the opposite direction, or travel to Poplar and either change there to travel to West India Quay, or walk the short distance between the stations.

==History==
The station opened in 1987 but was closed from 1991 to 1993 as the surrounding area was rebuilt. The station is near to the London Museum Docklands and the adjoining hotel and leisure facilities on the north quay of West India Docks, and indeed the platforms of the station extend over part of the dock.

===Late 2000s upgrades===
Between March and October 2007 the station&#x27;s canopy was replaced in a £1.85m project funded by Transport for London.
Throughout the project, TfL highlighted the sustainable nature of the project through its use of recycled materials while justifying the replacement as necessary due to the increasingly windy conditions as a result of taller developments nearby.

Construction was completed in May 2009 of a new single track dive-under as part of the current capacity upgrades. A ramp takes trains from Bank to Canary Wharf under the current Canary Wharf to Poplar track. The new track goes around West India Quay, before coming back up to rejoin the route to Canary Wharf. To construct the new track next to West India Quay the easternmost platform (Platform 1) had to be demolished. A consequence of this was, that during construction, trains from Canary Wharf to Poplar and trains from Bank to Canary Wharf had to cross each other at the same level which limited junction capacity.

The work was completed in May 2009, but the bypass track was not commissioned until 24 August. It is used by all trains running from Bank to Lewisham, but trains running in the opposite direction still call at West India Quay even during peak hours.

==Station layout==
Until the Delta Junction upgrade in 2009, West India Quay used to contain four platforms with four tracks. From west to east (platform 4 to 1) these platforms served trains to Westferry, to Poplar, from Westferry, and Poplar. After reconstruction, the old platform 1 ceased to exist with trains from Westferry diving under the junction and bypassing the station to the east. Trains from Poplar now arrive on platform 2.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) from West India Quay is:
* 12 tph to 
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to Canary Wharf

Services from Bank towards Lewisham do not stop at West India Quay.

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to Bank to up to 22 tph, and the service between Stratford and Canary Wharf to up to 16 tph in each direction with up to 8 tph during the peak hours extended beyond Canary Wharf to and from .

<text>Royal Victoria DLR station is on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in Canning Town, east London. The station opened in 1994 and is named after the nearby Royal Victoria Dock. It is on the DLR&#x27;s Beckton branch, in Travelcard Zone 3, and is the nearest station for the northern terminus of the IFS Cloud Cable Car and for London&#x27;s new City Hall.

==History==
The station is located on a stretch of line first opened in 1855, when the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) was forced to divert its line to North Woolwich (the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway) around the newly opened Royal Victoria Dock. This line went on to become part of National Rail&#x27;s North London line, although there was never a station at the site until the coming of the Docklands Light Railway.

When the Docklands Light Railway extension to Beckton was constructed in the 1990s, its tracks, between Canning Town and Custom House stations, were constructed on the same right of way but to the west and south side of the existing tracks. Royal Victoria station opened on the Docklands Light Railway tracks on 28 March 1994, while North London Line trains continued to pass without stopping on their tracks until that section of the line closed on 9 December 2006.

During 2009, as part of the Canning Town DLR flyover and the new DLR line from Canning Town to Stratford, an engineers&#x27; siding was added to the Victoria Dock Road side of the station.

On 1 June 2009 the Beckton branch was diverted onto the new flyover, which crossed the Woolwich branch and the branch to Stratford International. The flyover was constructed as part of the 3-Car Capacity Enhancement Project to serve Canning Town high-level DLR station. (See main article Docklands Light Railway extension to Stratford International.) It is 330 metres long, and is formed from a number of different structures connected by a continuous reinforced concrete deck cast &quot;in situ&quot;. In addition, it allows DLR services from Canning Town towards Woolwich and Beckton to depart from any eastbound DLR platform.

== Services ==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Royal Victoria is:
* 12 tph to of which 6 continue to Tower Gateway
* 12 tph to Beckton

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 147, 474 and night route N551 serve the station.

<text>East India is a station on Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in Leamouth, east London. It takes its name from the nearby former East India Docks of the Port of London, where ships trading with the Indian subcontinent used to dock.

It is on the Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal branches of the DLR, and is in Travelcard Zones 2 and 3. It opened, with the Beckton Branch, on 28 March 1994.

The historic Greenwich Prime Meridian crosses the DLR at the eastern end of the platforms, which is marked by an illuminated blue line underneath the tracks at street level. The modern IERS Reference Meridian used by GPS crosses the tracks approximately 117 metres further east between Neutron Tower and Switch House, but is unmarked.

== History ==
East India station was originally to be named &quot;Brunswick Wharf&quot; and this name was shown on the 1994 &#x27;all projections&#x27; map. &#x27;Brunswick&#x27; is now a code destination used to indicate that a train in the depot has been cleaned. In February 2001 an episode of the ITV series &quot;The Bill&quot; featured DLR trains with &#x27;Brunswick&#x27; as a dummy destination for filming purposes.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from East India is:
* 6 tph to Tower Gateway
* 6 tph to Bank
* 6 tph to Beckton
* 6 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction.


==Connections==
London Buses route D3 and night route N550 serve the station.

<text>Hendon Central is a London Underground station on an A41 junction in north-west London. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Colindale and Brent Cross stations, and is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 3 and Zone 4. Its postcode is NW4 2TE. 

The station was opened along with Brent Cross (then called Brent) tube station on 19 November 1923 as the first stage of an extension of the Golders Green branch of the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway. The station served as the terminus of the line&#x27;s western fork until 18 August 1924 when the second and final section of the extension to Edgware was opened.

==History==
Hendon Central, like all stations north from Golders Green, is a surface station (although the tracks enter twin tunnels a short distance further north on the way to Colindale). When it was built it stood &quot;in lonely glory amid fields&quot;, as one writer puts it, south of the old village of Hendon, which has since been swallowed up by London&#x27;s suburbs. The station is a Grade II listed building, designed in a neo-Georgian style by Stanley Heaps, who also designed Brent Cross station in a similar style, with a prominent portico featuring a Doric colonnade.

The fact that the area was largely undeveloped allowed a hitherto unusual degree of coordination between the station and the surrounding buildings that were constructed over the next few years. The station was intended to be the centre and a key architectural feature of a new suburban town; it faces a circus in diameter that is intersected by four approach roads which provide access to all parts of Hendon and the surrounding areas beyond. For many years this was a roundabout known as &#x27;Central Circus&#x27;; however it is now a crossroads controlled by traffic signals. Writing in 1932, William Passingham commented the integrated approach taken at Hendon Central as &quot;an outstanding example of the co-ordination of road-planning with passenger station requirements.&quot; He noted, only nine years after the station opened, that it had already become the centre of an &quot;ever-widening cluster of new houses&quot; and accurately predicted that it would become &quot;the centre of [a] small township&quot;, or what would now be called a suburb.

<doc id="827326" wikidata="Q2338128" url="?curid=827326" title="Charles Stewart (United States Navy officer)">
<text>Charles Stewart (28 July 1778 – 6 November 1869) was a United States Navy officer who commanded a number of warships, including . He saw service during the Quasi War and both Barbary Wars in the Mediterranean along North Africa and the War of 1812. He later commanded the navy yard in Philadelphia and was promoted to become the Navy&#x27;s first flag officer shortly before retiring. He was promoted to rear admiral after he retired from the Navy. He lived a long life and was the last surviving Navy captain who had served in the War of 1812.

==Early life==
On 28 July 1778, Stewart was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Charles and Sarah Harding (&quot;née&quot; Ford) Stewart, Scots-Irish immigrants from Belfast, only a month after British forces evacuated the city. His father died in 1780, leaving his mother little means to support him and his three siblings. She later remarried a former bodyguard of General Washington. Stewart attended Dr. Abercrombie&#x27;s Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia where he met Stephen Decatur and Richard Somers. He went to sea at the age of thirteen as a cabin boy and rose through the grades to become master of a merchantman.

==Early naval service==
During the Quasi-War with France, Stewart was one of the first officers in the rebirth of the United States Navy. At the age of nineteen, he was commissioned a lieutenant on 9 March 1798 and joined the frigate , under the command of John Barry, as fourth lieutenant for a cruise in the West Indies to restrain French privateers. Stewart was in charge of the ship&#x27;s outfitting and recruiting of crew.

On 16 July 1800 he assumed command of the schooner and captured two armed French vessels and recapturing several American ships. While anchored at the island of Dominica for water, he secured the release of an American citizen impressed onboard a Royal Navy warship. He later rescued approximately seventy people, mostly women and children from a vessel in distress at a reef near Saona Island, just before the schooner sank, for which the Governor of Santo Domingo sent a letter of thanks to President Jefferson.
After brief command of in 1801 and service in in 1802, Stewart sailed to the Mediterranean in command of the brig . He was promoted to master-commandant on 19 May 1804. There, he participated in the destruction of after her capture by Tripoli, helped to maintain the blockade of Tripoli, and distinguished himself in assaults on the enemy in August and September 1804. After the First Barbary War, he participated in a show of force at Tunis. He was second in command to Preble from 1803 through 1805. He was promoted to the rank of captain on 22 April 1806 and returned home on leave from US Navy, joining the merchant fleet, where he remained until the late 1811.

==War of 1812==

During the War of 1812, Stewart commanded, successively, , , and . Since &quot;Constellation&quot; was closely blockaded in Norfolk by the British, he took command of &quot;Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) at Boston on 18 July 1813. He made two brilliant cruises in her between 1813 and 1815.

Under Stewart&#x27;s command, &quot;Constitution&quot; captured the Royal Navy warships and on 20 February 1815. The Treaty of Ghent had been ratified by the United States government three days earlier but both sides in the battle were unaware of that event. Due to his capture of two enemy warships with only one ship, Stewart became a national hero and was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal on 22 February 1816. He was also admitted as an honorary member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati in the same year.

==Postwar career==
Stewart&#x27;s later service included command of the American Mediterranean squadron from 1816 to 1820 and of one in the Pacific from 1820 to 1824. For South American patriots fighting for their independence, commodore Stewart&#x27;s conduct in Peruvian waters was controversial because, claiming &quot;neutral rights&quot; for U.S. merchants, he escorted their ships through a patriot blockade to trade with Spanish royalists. His flagship, the USS Franklin, also transported a Spanish spy. (Stewart said he was unaware the Spaniard was on his ship, and he blamed his wife for secreting the man on board.) For these and other actions, the U.S. Navy subjected Stewart to a highly publicized court-martial upon return to the United States. Stewart&#x27;s wife refused to testify in his defense, and they soon divorced. Stewart biographers Berube and Rodgaard concluded about his trial that, “the Navy desperately needed a not-guilty verdict as several of its senior-most captains faced courts-martial in the summer of 1825.” A board of twelve of Stewart&#x27;s fellow officers found him not guilty.

Stewart served as a Naval Commissioner from 1830 to 1832.

In 1836 Stewart saw service in the West Indies and commanded a vessel that captured a Portuguese slave ship as it came into Havana. Before Stewart&#x27;s boarding crew took control of the ship, the captain of the ship jumped overboard, swam ashore and escaped. On board the slave ship were 250 enslaved African children, with many other slaves onboard the vessel having already died from a lack of water during the voyage. Outraged at the conditions and health of the children, Stewart informed the British commissioner in Havana, a Mr. Kennedy, of the dire situation he had encountered.

In the later years of his career, Stewart commanded the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 1838 to 1841, in 1846, and again from 1853 to 1861.

==Senior officer==

Upon the death of Captain James Barron in 1851, Stewart became the most senior ranking officer in the Navy. By a joint resolution passed on 2 March 1859, Congress made Stewart &quot;senior flag officer&quot; on 22 April 1859, a rank created for him in recognition of his distinguished and meritorious service.

Stewart was placed on the retired list on 21 December 1861 after serving 63 years in the Navy. His age at the time of his retirement was 83 years, 4 months and 24 days – making him the second oldest officer on active duty in the history of the U.S. Navy (after William D. Leahy). He was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list on 16 July 1862. Stewart holds the all time records for the longest active duty career and longest time holding a single rank on active duty (52 years 10 months).

Shortly before his death, Stewart was elected a companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States – a military society of officers who had served the Union during the Civil War. He was assigned the Society&#x27;s insignia number 1119.

Stewart died at Bordentown, New Jersey on 6 November 1869 at the age of 91. He was buried at Woodlands Cemetery in Philadelphia.

He first married Delia Tudor. His grandchildren, by their daughter Delia Tudor Stewart Parnell (1816–1918) and John Henry Parnell, included Charles Stewart Parnell, a prominent Irish political leader who fought for Irish home rule until his death in 1891, and Anna Parnell and Fanny Parnell, Irish nationalists who co-founded the Ladies&#x27; Land League in 1880 to raise money in America for the Land League.

Several of Stewart&#x27;s nephews served in the Navy, including Commodore Charles Stewart McCauley.

Charles Stewart was buried beneath an obelisk at Woodland Cemetery in Philadelphia.

In the late 19th century, his estate became the site of the Bordentown School, a residential high school academic and vocational training program.

Two U.S. Navy destroyers, DD-13 and DD-224, and one destroyer escort, DE-238, have been named in Stewart&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="827328" wikidata="Q1108796" url="?curid=827328" title="Colindale tube station">
<text>Colindale () is a London Underground station in Colindale, a suburb of north-west London. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Burnt Oak and Hendon Central stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
The station opened on 18 August 1924 on the north side of Colindale Avenue, on what was then the &#x27;Hampstead and Highgate Line&#x27;, the first station of the second section of the extension to Edgware. The platforms were located underneath the east–west road, not just on one side, and the station had a classical style building designed by Underground Architect Stanley Heaps. The opening of the station spurred the development of Colindale.

T. E. Lawrence regularly used the station when he was stationed at the nearby Hendon Aerodrome, and it was the source of the pen name &quot;Colin Dale&quot; which he used to submit articles for &quot;The Spectator&quot; during 1927 and 1928.

Colindale tube station was severely damaged during The Blitz. At 8:45 pm on 25 September 1940 the station was hit by a large bomb. Two trains with a total of 400 people on board were at the station at the time of the explosion, and 13 people were killed. Nine rescue parties worked through the night to rescue the survivors, and the station was visited on 26 September by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. A plaque in the ticket hall notes the event.

The simple temporary timber structure erected after the bombing actually lasted longer than the original building as it was not replaced until 1962 when a new building was constructed incorporating shops. As part of the removal of Colindale Station House in the mid 2010s, the 1962 building was reclad. 

=== Station rebuild ===
Since 2010, over 6,000 homes have been built in Colindale, including the redevelopment of the Hendon Police College. Barnet Council noted in 2019 that the use of the station had risen by 88% since 2009, and the population of Colindale ward had grown by 70%. Areas around the station were planned for substantial redevelopment, with over 10,000 new homes.

As part of the regeneration, agreement was reached between Barnet Council, Transport for London, property developers and the HM Government Levelling Up Fund to fund a new station building along with step-free access, built at a cost of £30 million. Designed by BDP, the design was inspired by the Hendon Aerodrome, which closed in the 1960s. The new station building would replace the 1960s ticket hall, albeit located over the tracks rather than built to the side, as at present. Two large towers with 300 new homes will also be built directly adjacent to the new station building. 

Consultation took place in 2018, with planning approval for the new station building in 2019. Funding approval from HM Government was received in January 2024. In February 2024, it was announced that the station would close temporarily from Friday 7 June 2024 until December 2024 to allow construction work to take place. The station reopened in December 2024 after completion of phase 1 – the staircase was reconstructed but the new entrance remains incomplete.

==Attractions==
The Royal Air Force Museum London is a popular destination for travellers going to Colindale. Located on the site of the former Hendon Aerodrome, the museum is around a ten minutes walk from the station.

The British Library Newspaper Library was situated in Colindale until 2013. The Colindale tube station was also a popular destination for travellers intending to reach the shopping centre of Oriental City up until its closure.

==Services==
The station is sometimes used as a terminus for trains travelling north, instead of them continuing to Edgware. Some regular off-peak service patterns in recent years have seen all trains joining the Edgware branch from the Bank branch terminating at Colindale. However, this was not the pattern in 2009. Reversal of trains at this station makes use of a turn-back siding, situated between the running lines north of the station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 125, 204, 303 and night route N5 serve the station.

<doc id="827330" wikidata="Q335338" url="?curid=827330" title="Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth">
<text>Admiral Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth, GCB (19 April 1757 – 23 January 1833) was a British naval officer. He fought during the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars. His younger brother Israel Pellew also pursued a naval career.

==Childhood==
Pellew was born at Dover, the second son of Samuel Pellew (1712–1764), commander of a Dover packet, and his wife, Constantia Langford.

The Pellew family was Cornish, descended from a family that came originally from Normandy, but had for many centuries been settled in the west of Cornwall. Edward&#x27;s grandfather, Humphrey Pellew (1650–1721), a merchant and ship owner, son of a naval officer, resided at Flushing manor-house in the parish of Mylor. Part of the town of Flushing was built by Samuel Trefusis, MP for Penryn; the other part was built by Humphrey Pellew, who was buried there. He also had a property and a tobacco plantation in Maryland. Part of the town of Annapolis stands on what was, before the American Revolution, the estate of the Pellews.

On the death of Edward&#x27;s father in 1764 the family removed to Penzance, and Pellew was educated for some years at Truro Grammar School. He was a pugnacious youth, which did not endear him to his headmaster. He ran away to sea at the age of 14, but soon deserted because of unfair treatment to another midshipman. Pellew described himself as &quot;pock-marked, ugly, uninteresting and uneducated&quot;; a naval historian adds that he was &quot;tough, brave, skilful, lucky, and unscrupulous&quot;.

==Early career==
===1770s===
In 1770, Pellew entered the Royal Navy on board with Captain John Stott, and made a voyage to the Falkland Islands. In 1772, he followed Stott to and in her was in the Mediterranean for three years. In consequence of a high-spirited quarrel with his captain, he was put on shore at Marseilles where he found an old friend of his father&#x27;s in command of a merchant ship. He was able to get a passage to Lisbon and so home.

He was later in , under the command of Captain Philemon Pownoll, which took General John Burgoyne to America in the spring of 1776. In October, Pellew and midshipman Brown were detached for service in the &quot;Carleton&quot; tender on Lake Champlain, under Lieutenant Dacres. During the Battle of Valcour Island on 11 October, Dacres and Brown were both severely wounded, and the command devolved on Pellew. Pellew extricated the vessel from a position of great danger by his personal gallantry. As a reward for his service, he was immediately appointed to command the &quot;Carleton&quot;. In December, Lord Howe promised him a commission as lieutenant when he could reach New York, and in the following January Lord Sandwich wrote promising to promote him when he came to England. In the summer of 1777, Pellew and a small party of seamen were attached to the army under Burgoyne, and he was present in the fighting at Saratoga, where his youngest brother John was killed. He and the rest of the force were taken prisoner. After the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga, he was repatriated.

He returned to England and was promoted on 9 January 1778 to be lieutenant of the guardship at Portsmouth. He wanted to be appointed to a seagoing ship, but Lord Sandwich considered that he was bound by the terms of the surrender at Saratoga not to undertake any active service. Towards the end of the year, he was appointed to the &quot;Licorne&quot; which went out to Newfoundland in the spring of 1779, returning in the winter, when Pellew was moved into the &quot;Apollo&quot; with his old captain Pownoll. On 15 June 1780, the &quot;Apollo&quot; engaged a large French privateer, the &quot;Stanislaus&quot;, off Ostend. Pownoll was killed by a musket-shot, but Pellew continued the action and dismasted the &quot;Stanislaus&quot;, driving her on shore where she was protected by the neutrality of the coast. On the 18th, Lord Sandwich wrote to him: &quot;I will not delay informing you that I mean to give you immediate promotion as a reward for your gallant and officer-like conduct.&quot; On 1 July, he was accordingly promoted to the command of the sloop &quot;Hazard&quot;, which was employed for the next six months on the east coast of Scotland and was then paid off.

===Peacetime service===
In March 1782 Pellew was appointed to the , a small French prize, so small indeed that he used to say &quot;his servant could dress his hair from the deck while he sat in the cabin.&quot; On 28 April while cruising on the coast of Brittany, he engaged three privateers and drove them on shore. In special reward for this service, he was promoted to post rank on 25 May and, ten days later, was appointed to the temporary command of the , in which he captured a large frigate-built privateer on 1 July.

From 1786 to 1789, he commanded the frigate under the Commander-in-Chief, Newfoundland, returning home each winter by Cádiz and Lisbon. Afterwards, he commanded the &quot;Salisbury&quot; on the same station as flag-captain to Vice-Admiral Milbanke. In 1791, he was placed on half-pay and tried his hand at farming on Treverry Farm near Helston, a property owned by his brother who was a senior customs officer of Flushing. This met with indifferent success, during which time he attempted to sell a bull, only to find that it was in the ownership of a neighbouring farmer.

The Russians offered him a command in the Russian navy but Pellew declined the offer. He was still struggling with the difficulties of his farm when the revolutionary government of France declared war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793.

===Wartime service===
Pellew immediately applied for a ship and was appointed to the , a 36-gun frigate which he fitted out in a remarkably short time. He had expected a good deal of difficulty in manning her and had enlisted some 80 Cornish miners who were sent round to the ship at Spithead. He put to sea with these and about a dozen seamen, plus officers who were obliged to help in the work aloft. He filled his complement of crew by pressing from the merchant ships in the Channel, but with very few seasoned navy men. On 18 June, &quot;Nymphe&quot; sailed from Falmouth on the news that two French frigates had been seen in the Channel.

At the action of 18 June 1793, &quot;Nymphe&quot; fell in with the , also of 36 guns and commanded by Captain Jean Mullon, one of the few officers of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; who still remained in the French navy. After a short but very sharp action, &quot;Cléopâtre&quot;″s mizzenmast and wheel were shot away, making the ship unmanageable, and it fell foul of the &quot;Nymphe&quot;. Pellew&#x27;s crew boarded her in a fierce rush and captured her. Mullon was mortally wounded, and died trying to swallow his commission, which in his dying agony he had mistaken for the code of secret signals. The code thus fell intact into Pellew&#x27;s hands, and was forwarded to the Admiralty. &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; was the first frigate taken in the war and was brought to Portsmouth. The Earl of Chatham presented Pellew to the king on 29 June, and the king knighted him.

Pellew transferred to in December 1793. In 1794, &quot;Arethusa&quot; was part of the western squadron of frigates based at Falmouth under Sir John Borlase Warren. On 23 April, the squadron engaged a French squadron to the southwest of Guernsey, the stronger British force quickly overpowering their opponents in an action where &quot;Arethusa&quot; played the primary role in fighting the , at the time the largest frigate in service. &quot;Pomone&quot; surrendered after an engagement that lasted less than half an hour. The French had suffered between 80 and 100 casualties; &quot;Arethusa&quot; had only three dead and five wounded. Warren&#x27;s squadron went on to destroy one frigate and capture another. They also drove ashore the corvettes &quot;Alerte&quot; and &quot;Espion&quot;, both of which had been Royal Navy sloops. Pellew refused to burn either ship, as they contained wounded men, and the French later refloated &quot;Espion&quot;. The squadron also captured many vessels from French coastal convoys.

==Service in the French Revolutionary War==

By 1794, he was commodore of the Western Squadron. In 1795, he took command of , the ship with which he is most closely associated. The squadron also comprised the frigates , , , and .

He was a good swimmer and noted for saving the lives of several seamen who had fallen overboard. The most striking life-saving event was on 26 January 1796 when the East Indiaman was carrying more than four hundred troops, together with many women and children, when it ran aground under Plymouth Hoe. Due to the heavy seas, the crew and soldiers aboard were unable to get to shore. Pellew swam out to the wreck with a line and, with help from young Irishman Jeremiah Coghlan, helped rig a lifeline that saved almost all aboard. For this feat he was created a baronet on 18 March 1796.

On 13 April 1796, off the coasts of Ireland, his squadron captured the French frigate &quot;Unité&quot;, and the nine days later.

His most noted action was the action of 13 January 1797, cruising in company with , when the British sighted the French 74-gun ship of the line . Normally, a ship of the line would over-match two frigates, but the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was a razée (built as a 3rd rate 64-gun ship of the line and then cut down), the stormy conditions limited the use of the lower gun deck on the French ship and by skillful sailing in the stormy conditions, the frigates avoided bearing the brunt of the superior firepower of the French. In the early morning of 14 January, the three ships were embayed on a lee shore in Audierne Bay. Both the &quot;Droits de l&#x27;Homme&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; ran aground, but &quot;Indefatigable&quot; managed to claw her way off the lee shore to safety.

Pellew was also responsible for pressing young violinist and composer Joseph Antonio Emidy who had been playing in the Lisbon Opera orchestra.

==Admiralcy and peerage==

Pellew was promoted to rear admiral in 1804. He was then appointed Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. It took six months to sail out to Penang, so he took up the appointment in 1805.

When in February 1808 Pellew was at sea in his flagship, , he heard of the outbreak of war between the United Kingdom and Denmark. He immediately sailed to the Danish settlement at Tranquebar, taking it by surprise. When Admiral Drury arrived to replace Pellew as C-in-C, East Indies, and to seize Tranquebar, he found that he was too late. Pellew&#x27;s seizing the moment gained him some £40,000–50,000 in prize money.

Following his return from the east in 1809, he was appointed to the position of Commander-in-Chief, North Sea from 1810 to 1811 and Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, from 1811 to 1814, and again from 1815 to 1816.

In 1814, he was made Baron Exmouth of Canonteign. In 1816, he led an Anglo-Dutch fleet against the Barbary states. Victory at the Bombardment of Algiers secured the release of the 1,200 Christian slaves in the city. For this action, he was created 1st Viscount Exmouth on 10 December 1816. Following his return to England, he became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth from 1817 to 1821, when he effectively retired from active service. He continued to attend and speak in the House of Lords. In 1832, he was appointed Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom and Admiral of the Red Squadron of His Majesty&#x27;s Fleet, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, also of the Royal and distinguished Order of Charles III of Spain, of the Military Order of William of the Netherlands, of the Royal Sicilian Order of St. Ferdinand and Merit, of the Order of St Maurice and St Lazarus of Sardinia, Knight of the Most Honourable and Most Ancient Order of the Annunziata of the Royal House of Savoy, High Steward of Great Yarmouth, and one of the Elder Brethren of the Hon. Corporation of the Trinity House.

He bought Bitton House in Teignmouth in 1812 and it was his home until his death in 1833. He was buried in Christow on the eastern edge of Dartmoor on 30 Jan 1833. A note on the parish burial record states, &quot;No Singing, No Sermon&quot;. The museum in Teignmouth has a comprehensive collection of artefacts that belonged to him.

==Marriage and family==
On 28 May 1783, Pellew married Susan Frowde. They had four sons and two daughters. These children were:
* Emma Mary Pellew (18 January 1785 – March 1835). Married Captain Lawrence Halsted in December 1803.
* Pownoll Bastard Pellew, later 2nd Viscount Exmouth (1 July 1786 – 2 December 1833)
* Julia Pellew (28 November 1787 – 26 December 1831)
* Fleetwood Broughton Reynolds Pellew, later an admiral and knight (13 December 1789 – 28 July 1861)
* George Pellew, Dean of Norwich (3 April 1793 – 13 October 1866)
* Edward William Pellew, later a minister (3 November 1799 – 29 August 1869), whose daughter Frances Helen Pellew married Sir Louis Mallet

==Geographical namesakes==
The Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands situated in the Gulf of Carpentaria were named after Pellew by Matthew Flinders, who visited them in 1802. Other Australian geographical features include Cape Pellew (adjacent to the islands) and Exmouth Gulf.

Point Pellew, Alaska was named after Pellew by Captain George Vancouver during his expedition in 1794.

Palau (formerly the Pellew or Pelew Islands), east of the Philippines, is often said to be named for Edward Pellew, but it was called that by Captain Henry Wilson in 1783 which was well before Pellew came to prominence. It appears to be an anglicization of the indigenous name Belau.

There is also a building named after him in , where Naval basic training is conducted, that is used as sleeping quarters for new recruits. Additionally, a Sea Cadet Unit in Truro is called T.S. &quot;Pellew&quot;.

A building at Wyvern Barracks in Exeter, Devon is used as a temporary billet and a training facility for the Army Cadet force as well as other units. It was handed over to the army from the navy. However, it retains the name Pellew House in memory of Sir Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth.

==Fictional appearances==
Pellew is featured as the Captain of in some of C. S. Forester&#x27;s fictional Horatio Hornblower novels. In the television adaptations, he is portrayed by Robert Lindsay and given a more prominent role. He appears as a midshipman in the novel &quot;Jack Absolute&quot; by Chris Humphreys. Pellew is the name of a minor character in several of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin novels, including &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot; and &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;. He has a small role as a captain in the American Revolution in &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot;, a historical novel by Kenneth Roberts. He appears in Alexander Kent&#x27;s Adam Bolitho novel &quot;Relentless Pursuit&quot;, which partially relates to Pellew&#x27;s expedition against the Barbary States. He also appears in the twenty-second Thomas Kydd novel, &quot;To The Eastern Seas&quot; by Julian Stockwin.

<text>Burnt Oak is a London Underground station in Burnt Oak, North London, on Watling Avenue, off the A5 (the Edgware Road, originally a Roman Road known as Watling Street). It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line between Edgware and Colindale stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 4.

==Location==
Burnt Oak is on Watling Avenue, situated near the Burnt Oak Library, separated by the rail tracks. The station serves a moderate residential area. Rows of shops are along Watling Avenue. Barnfield Primary School, Burnt Oak Brook, Goldbeaters Primary School, Barnet Burnt Oak Leisure Center and Edgware Community Hospital are nearby.

==History==
The station was designed by architect Stanley Heaps and opened as Burnt Oak (for Watling) on 27 October 1924, two months after the extension of the Hampstead &amp; Highgate Line from Hendon Central to Edgware had opened. For a while, the station was going to be named &quot;Sheves Hill&quot;, and this name appears on a version of the Underground map from 1924. On a later version &quot;Sheves Hill&quot; is crossed out with &quot;Burnt Oak&quot; printed on the side. The station was originally provided with a temporary structure before the final ticket office building was constructed in 1925. The suffix was dropped from the name about 1950.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

==Services and connections==

<text>SP/k is a programming language developed circa 1974 by R.C. Holt, D.B. Wortman, D.T. Barnard and J.R. Cordy as a subset of the PL/I programming language designed for teaching programming. It was used for about a decade at over 40 universities, schools, and research laboratories in Canada and the United States.

SP/k was one of the first languages specifically designed to encourage structured programming. The features of SP/k were chosen to encourage structured problem solving by computers, to make the language easy to learn and use, to eliminate confusing and redundant constructs, and to make the language easy to compile. The resulting language was suitable for introducing programming concepts used in various applications, including business data processing, scientific calculations and non-numeric computation.

SP/k is actually a sequence of language subsets called SP/1, SP/2, ... SP/8. Each subset introduces new programming language constructs while retaining all the constructs of preceding subsets, forming a stepwise system for teaching computer programming. Each subset is precisely defined and self-contained, and can be learned or implemented without the following subsets. This allows for various levels of programming education. The design and philosophy of SP/k was a strong influence on the Turing programming language.

<text>Brent Cross is a London Underground station located on Highfield Avenue in the Golders Green area of north west London. The station is a Grade II listed building.

The station is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Hendon Central and Golders Green stations, and in Travelcard Zone 3. The Brent Cross shopping centre is equidistant between this station and Hendon Central station.

==History==
The station was designed by architect Stanley Heaps and opened as Brent, the name of the nearby river, on 19 November 1923. It was the first station of the extension of what was then known as the Hampstead &amp; Highgate Line, which was built through undeveloped rural areas to Edgware.

The extension had first been planned prior to the First World War when the station had been due to be called &quot;Woodstock&quot;. It was renamed from Brent to its current name on the 2 March 1976 opening of the shopping centre, and to avoid confusion with the recently created London Borough of Brent which the station was not located in.

Two passing loops were built at the station, not long after it opened, to allow fast trains to overtake slower ones here, but these extra tracks were removed in the 1930s. The bridges over Highfield Avenue reflect this extra width, although both north and south of the station the alignment narrows again.

== Development ==
A planning application, registered in March 2008, for the nearby Brent Cross area would improve bus services passing the station. A turning circle for buses outside the tube station is proposed, needing the demolition of nearby housing.

In early 2008, the London Group of the Campaign for Better Transport published the North and West London Light Railway Proposal (q.v.) for a rapid transit scheme through the Brent Cross site, terminating at the tube station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 112, 210 and 232 serve the station.

<doc id="827336" wikidata="Q719866" url="?curid=827336" title="Monica Geller">
<text>Monica E. Geller (born June 15, 1969) is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appears on the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1994–2004). Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and portrayed by actress Courteney Cox, Monica appears in all of the show&#x27;s 236 episodes, from its premiere in 1994, to its finale in 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature, Monica is the younger sister of Ross Geller and best friend of Rachel Green, the latter of whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters spend several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend Chandler Bing, whom she marries. Unable to conceive children on their own, Chandler and Monica eventually adopt twins Erica and Jack and move out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.

The creators&#x27; first choice for the role of Monica was comedienne Janeane Garofalo. Cox had originally been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character&#x27;s best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston. Before &quot;Friends&quot; aired, Monica&#x27;s characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with someone on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica&#x27;s existing storyline. The character&#x27;s struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.

Several months before &quot;Friends&quot; premiered, NBC had conducted a research report, the results of which determined that Monica was the only character to have been remotely well received by test audiences. When &quot;Friends&quot; first aired, critics initially perceived Monica – who was immediately established as the show&#x27;s &quot;mother hen&quot; – and Cox as the series&#x27; main character and star, respectively. Critics have been largely receptive towards both Cox and her character; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; holds Cox&#x27;s acting responsible for disproving the stigma that attractive women are incapable of delivering comedic performances. Revered as a television icon, Monica famously addressed several topics that were rarely discussed in prime time television at the time, including safe sex, casual sex, and age disparity in relationships and was well known for her striking classic beauty and being a popular fashion icon of the 1990s.

==Characterization==
A hardworking chef Monica is introduced in the pilot as one of five close-knit friends who live in New York City, including her older brother Ross (David Schwimmer), neighbors Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), and former roommate Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). When her privileged, inexperienced childhood best friend Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), with whom she had long lost contact, suddenly arrives in her neighborhood unannounced as a runaway bride after abandoning her own wedding, Monica allows her to move in with her while she attempts to reorganize her life, and the two reconnect.

Monica&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;I know!&quot;

=== Relationships ===
Richard Burke

Monica begins dating Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), an older man who is also one of her father&#x27;s best friends and 21 years her senior, during season 2. However, the couple mutually agree to end their relationship after realizing that Richard does not want children, his own having already grown up (and had children of their own), while Monica aspires to eventually raise a family of her own one day. Monica and Richard have a hard time moving on from their relationship, and after running into each other a few months later, start a supposedly casual sexual relationship. However, they quickly admit they are still fundamentally incompatible, and part ways again.

In the season six finale, Richard returns and professes his love for Monica, and tells her he wants her back, and wants to have children with her. Since Chandler had been pretending to never want marriage in order for his proposal to be a surprise, Monica considers getting back together with Richard. Chandler confronts Richard, and Richard encourages Chandler to go after Monica, and to never let her go.

Chandler Bing

While in England attending Ross&#x27; second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially supposed to have been a casual, one-time thing which grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but attempt to conceal it from their friends for as long as possible.

Once their relationship is finally out in the open, they often deal with Chandler&#x27;s relationship issues. He hasn&#x27;t had much experience with women, and he has commitment issues, both of which cause problems. He is also shown being nervous about Monica&#x27;s obvious desire to be a mother. Over time however, Chandler grows to be a good partner for Monica. The relationship started with Monica being the more mature (when it comes to relationships) person, but Chandler changes to become the steady person, a great foil for Monica&#x27;s neuroses.

They eventually move in together and later marry.

After several failed attempts to conceive a child of their own, Monica and Chandler discover that they are both infertile, and ultimately settle upon adoption as an alternative, deciding to adopt the yet-to-be-born child of expectant single mother Erica (Anna Faris). The couple is very much surprised when Erica gives birth to twins, and name the boy Jack after Monica&#x27;s father, and the girl Erica after her birth mother.

At the series end, Chandler, Monica, and the twins leave the New York City apartment for a house in Westchester.

== Development ==

=== Conception and writing ===
Television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman originally pitched &quot;Friends&quot; as a show about &quot;that special time in your life when your friends are your family&quot; to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield shortly after their short-lived sitcom &quot;Family Album&quot; was canceled by CBS. Inspired by their own experiences as young adults living in New York City, the writers loosely based the six main characters on some of their own friends and family; Monica is based on Kauffman herself. Observing that each main character was originally written as a &quot;one-note stereotype&quot;, Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; identified Monica as the group&#x27;s &quot;uptight fun-killer&quot;. When &quot;Friends&quot; first aired, the majority of its earliest episodes revolved around Monica, via whom each character appears to be interconnected; &quot;Friends&quot; stars the character&#x27;s brother, her best friend, her former roommate and her two neighbors socializing in Monica&#x27;s apartment.

In the pilot, Monica is dumped almost immediately after sleeping with her new date Paul on the night of their first date. Monica is tricked into bed with him after Paul lies to her about his sex life, falsely alleging that he has not slept with anyone in the two years since his wife left him. At first, NBC executives worried that audiences would react to Monica&#x27;s role unfavorably, thus they decided to survey the studio audience and ask them whether or not they thought that having Monica sleep with someone on their first date made her character too promiscuous. Don Ohlmeyer, then-president of NBC&#x27;s west coast division, was particularly adamant about his stance against Monica&#x27;s role in the pilot, which he considered &quot;casual sex&quot;. Kauffman recalled Ohlmeyer specifically expressing that Monica deserved to be dumped, a statement by which the writer was greatly offended, dismissing Ohlmeyer as a misogynist. Ultimately, the results returned in favor of Monica; audiences liked the character nonetheless, and the episode aired unchanged.

Early in the series, Monica&#x27;s apartment is established as one of the show&#x27;s two primary locations. In the pilot, the apartment number is 5, which was changed to 20 in subsequent episodes after the writers determined that Monica actually lived on a much higher floor. Season three&#x27;s &quot;The One Where No One&#x27;s Ready&quot; takes place entirely in Monica&#x27;s apartment because the show&#x27;s budget was not large enough to accommodate additional sets or guest stars at that time. In the series finale, Phoebe certifies that each character shared Monica&#x27;s apartment at least one point during their lives.

==== Relationship with Chandler Bing ====
Andrew Harrison of &quot;The New Republic&quot; believes that the writers deliberately broke up any main character who was approaching a borderline life-changing relationship because &quot;The ones the Friends were really meant to be with were, after all, the other Friends&quot;. Because Monica and Joey were initially conceived as the show&#x27;s two most sexual characters, Crane and Kauffman had originally intended for them to be the show&#x27;s main couple, before ultimately replacing them with Ross and Rachel. The idea of Monica and Joey was abandoned once the role of Joey was cast; actor Matt LeBlanc approached his character using much more of a &quot;big brother vibe&quot; in terms of Joey&#x27;s relationship with Cox&#x27;s character as opposed to a romantic one, which the writers ultimately preferred. According to Allison Piwowarski of Bustle, Monica and Joey&#x27;s relationship would have greatly altered the trajectory of the entire series, having life-changing effects on its characters. However, there were incidents on the show referencing a possible intimate relationship between the two, such as Monica&#x27;s initial attraction to Joey when he moved in and Monica&#x27;s intent to sleep with Joey in London rather than Chandler. Those events proved only to be humorous, nonetheless.

Summarizing the role of Monica in the series, Martin Gitlin wrote in his book &quot;The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time&quot; that while her friends &quot;were ... just out to make the most of their social lives&quot;, Monica &quot;sought to keep the others in line&quot; while searching for &quot;Mr. Right&quot;, who surprisingly turns out to be close friend Chandler.

Several years before Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, Cox once joked in an interview that if her character were to ever have sex with another main character, it would most likely be Chandler. Crane and Kauffman had never intended to pair off Monica and Chandler with each other, and only decided to expand upon the idea of a relationship between the two friends upon realizing that viewers had &quot;fallen in love&quot; with the notion of Monica and Chandler as a couple. According to Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Their affair came out of the blue and was supposed to quickly return there — but something in the relationship clicked with viewers.&quot; The idea of Monica and Chandler&#x27;s romantic arc originally surfaced much earlier in the series from writers Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, who first observed the characters&#x27; chemistry in the season two episode &quot;The One Where Ross Finds Out&quot;, in which an idle and unemployed Monica is temporarily acting as Chandler&#x27;s personal trainer. However, Silveri&#x27;s suggestion was initially vetoed by the other writers, who felt that it was simply too soon to introduce another main couple to &quot;Friends&quot; having just recently paired off Ross and Rachel. Following Ross and Rachel&#x27;s break up in season three, the writers felt that the timing was just about right to officially introduce Monica and Chandler as a couple, deciding that &quot;Friends&quot; &quot;can&#x27;t simply rest on this one [Ross and Rachel] relationship&quot;, while believing that Monica and Chandler&#x27;s would ultimately provide a fun opportunity for the writers to explore brand new storylines.

Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan deliberately intended to keep Monica and Chandler&#x27;s union &quot;low-key&quot; in order to further differentiate it from Ross and Rachel&#x27;s, which had been very public. In order to get an idea how audiences would react to Monica and Chandler hooking up at Ross and Emily&#x27;s wedding in London, the scene in which a clearly nude Monica suddenly emerges from under the sheets of Chandler&#x27;s hotel bed was filmed in front of three separate test audiences, each of whom responded very enthusiastically to the surprise, several months before the episode was actually taped. Despite the warm reception received from the audience, Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan were at first uncertain as to whether or not they should continue expanding upon their relationship even further, and proceeded with caution by having Monica and Chandler initially keep their relationship hidden from their peers. Protective of their characters, Cox and Perry shared similar hesitations at first, but ultimately grew to accept Monica and Chandler as a couple. The characters&#x27; relationship is eventually revealed to their friends in the episode &quot;The One Where Everybody Finds Out&quot;. While each character very much approves of their union, Monica&#x27;s parents initially resent their daughter&#x27;s feelings for Chandler due to an age-old misunderstanding involving Chandler.

Bianco observed that &quot;On most shows, linking two main characters like Monica and Chandler would have been an act of desperation.&quot; However, &quot;On &quot;Friends&quot;, it was a stroke of genius that made both characters more appealing while providing a needed diversion from the show&#x27;s central task: Retaining a romantic equilibrium between Ross and Rachel.&quot; Monica and Chandler&#x27;s relationship is the antithesis of Ross and Rachel&#x27;s because it remained &quot;healthy and strong until the series ended&quot;, while the other couple was relentlessly on-and-off. &quot;Encyclopedia of Television&quot; author Horace Newcomb believes that Monica&#x27;s feelings for Chandler are responsible for curing the latter&#x27;s fear of commitment. Similarly, &quot;Slate&quot; writer Ruth Graham observed that &quot;Chandler is painted as a self-loathing loser with women, until he finally snags Monica at the end of Season 4.&quot; Meanwhile, Silveri believes that &quot;Friends&quot; ultimately ran as long as it did due in part to Monica and Chandler&#x27;s romance, explaining, &quot;if the center of &quot;Friends&quot; had remained Ross and Rachel, you would&#x27;ve seen a much shorter shelf life for the show&quot;; Monica and Chandler&#x27;s arc is believed to have extended the series by approximately three years. Crane and Kauffman had always intended to give Monica and Chandler a child. When it finally came time for them to write the finale, the idea of the couple adopting newborn twins was conceived at the last minute simply &quot;for fun&quot;. The birth of Monica and Chandler&#x27;s twins serves as one of the finale&#x27;s main plots. They were named Jack and Erica – after Monica&#x27;s father and their birth mother, respectively. The twins are born three minutes and forty-six seconds apart. Although the surprise addition of Monica and Chandler&#x27;s twins was generally well received, critics questioned the fact that the babies are brought home from the hospital the same day as their delivery

=== Casting ===
Monica is portrayed by American actress Courteney Cox.

Crane and Kauffman had originally written the role of Monica with comedienne Janeane Garofalo in mind, because they were drawn to her &quot;edgier and snarkier&quot; voice. However, Garofalo turned down the offer. Actress Jami Gertz was also offered the role but declined, while actress Leah Remini auditioned for Monica prior to guest starring as a pregnant single mother in an early episode. Kristin Davis also auditioned, and later guest starred in the episode &quot;The One with Ross&#x27;s Library Book&quot;.

A close competitor for the role of Monica was actress Nancy McKeon; Littlefield recalled having greatly enjoyed Cox and McKeon&#x27;s auditions equally, and left the final decision up to Crane and Kauffman. Ultimately, Cox won the role over McKeon because the creators noticed &quot;something fresh&quot; in her audition; Kauffman elaborated that Cox ultimately &quot;brought a whole bunch of other colors&quot; to Monica than what they had first envisioned back when they were considering Garofalo for the part.

Before being cast as Monica in &quot;Friends&quot;, Cox was best known for appearing in singer Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; music video; within the television industry for her recurring role as Lauren Miller, Alex P. Keaton&#x27;s girlfriend, on the sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;; and Melissa Robinson in the comedy film &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; (1994), opposite Jim Carrey. After guest starring on the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as Meryl, main character Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s girlfriend, the producers offered Cox the role of Monica&#x27;s spoiled best friend Rachel because the actress &quot;had this cheery, upbeat energy&quot;, which was significantly different from how they had envisioned Monica at the time. Feeling she was not &quot;quirky&quot; enough to portray Rachel, Cox lobbied in favor of playing Monica instead because she was drawn to the character&#x27;s &quot;strong&quot; personality, but the producers feared that she was not &quot;tough&quot; enough for the role, which was offered to actress Jennifer Aniston, alongside whom Cox would eventually co-star. Meanwhile, Aniston ultimately won the role of Rachel.
Each main cast member auditioned for &quot;Friends&quot; having had some degree of prior sitcom experience. Before finally being cast in &quot;Friends&quot;, Cox&#x27;s burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her physical appearance. Unlike her previous roles in projects such as &quot;Family Ties&quot; and &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Steve Weinstein believes that Monica was the first major role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty. Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom &quot;The Trouble with Larry&quot;, which she considers to be the first time she played a character who &quot;was the funny one&quot;, which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for &quot;Friends&quot; following its cancellation.

When &quot;Friends&quot; premiered, Cox was the show&#x27;s most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show&#x27;s star, despite Crane and Kauffman&#x27;s efforts to promote &quot;Friends&quot; as an ensemble comedy. According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work together as a team. As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other&#x27;s ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her &quot;If I could do anything funnier&quot;.

Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member. Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode. At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied, temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts. The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode, making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.

Cox was 29 years old at the time she was cast, making her the show&#x27;s second oldest main cast member, and was 39 by the beginning of &quot;Friends&quot;″ final season. Additionally, this distinction makes Cox older than her on-screen brother, actor David Schwimmer, who portrays her older brother Ross, who is one year her senior. The actress would deliver Monica&#x27;s lines emphatically.

Although each character is depicted as an avid coffee drinker, spending much of their free time in a coffee house, Cox herself does not drink coffee, and was only pretending to drink it out of mugs on the show. Kauffman believes that Cox&#x27;s own cleanliness closely resembles her character&#x27;s; at times the actress would clean her co-stars&#x27; dressing rooms. Cox also shares the character&#x27;s motherly nature. The actress enjoyed portraying Monica as she was able to &quot;bring more of my own personality to her, and I&#x27;ve never really been able to do that before.&quot;

Starpulse.com observed that &quot;As Monica, Cox never quite enjoyed the sort of watercooler storylines that co-star ... Jennifer Aniston had with David Schwimmer as the on-again, off-again Rachel and Ross.&quot; At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to accept the role of Monica over Rachel due to the character&#x27;s lack of strong storylines; she eventually relented once Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, thus her character&#x27;s storylines gradually began to improve.

Cox married actor David Arquette in 1999 while the show was on hiatus between seasons five and six, hence the actress legally changed her full name to Courteney Cox Arquette. The opening credits of the season six premiere &quot;The One After Vegas&quot; features an inside joke in which Cox&#x27;s new surname &quot;Arquette&quot; is attached to the surnames of each cast and crew member. The episode is dedicated to Cox and Arquette, reading, &quot;For Courteney and David, who did get married.&quot; Before marrying Cox, Arquette had guest starred in an episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as Phoebe&#x27;s love interest. During season 10, Cox got pregnant with her and Arquette&#x27;s child. At that same time, her character and on-screen husband were going through the process of adopting a child. Like Monica and Chandler, Cox and Arquette had also struggled with conceiving in real life. Although Kudrow&#x27;s real-life pregnancy had successfully been written into the show, the same could not have been done for Cox because &quot;Friends&quot; had already long-established that Monica is incapable of having children. Therefore, the crew attempted to conceal Cox&#x27;s pregnancy using a combination of baggy, loose-fitting costumes and props instead. However, at times the actress&#x27; growing belly was still detectable by viewers in spite of the crew&#x27;s best efforts.

== Characterization and themes ==

=== Codependency and neuroticism ===
At the beginning of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes Monica was the show&#x27;s most fully realized character from the beginning of the series because her &quot;quirks were developed to a tee.&quot; Like several strong female sitcom characters popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly &quot;vocalising a desire for motherhood.&quot; As the group&#x27;s &quot;unofficial den mother&quot;, Monica fulfills the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; identifying Monica as the show&#x27;s most grounded character. Jill O&#x27;Rourke of Crushable described her as &quot;the glue that held the group together.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; believes that Monica serves as &quot;the solid center in a circle of wacky pals&quot; due to her &quot;sunny&quot; personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a steady job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show&#x27;s &quot;straight woman&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John J. O&#x27;Connor believes that Monica exhibits &quot;the strongest ties to reality&quot; as the sitcom&#x27;s most realistically portrayed character. Bustle&#x27;s James Tison agreed that Monica is the show&#x27;s most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series&#x27; &quot;head friends&quot;, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&#x27;s&quot; Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that she and brother Ross represent &quot;the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate.&quot; Describing her as &quot;ultra-competent&quot;, &quot;Natural Living Today&quot;″s Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began &quot;Friends&quot; as the show&#x27;s straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox&#x27;s own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.

Identified by Ayn Bernos of &quot;Thought Catalog&quot; as &quot;the epitome of a ... control freak&quot;, Refinery29&#x27;s Kelsey Miller summarized Monica&#x27;s personality as funny, uptight, loving, and competitive. A very organized character with a signature Type A personality who enjoys being in charge, Monica is known for being a &quot;neat freak&quot; obsessed with cleanliness – especially when it comes to maintaining the impeccable condition of her apartment – neurotic, extremely obsessive-compulsive, and competitive in nature, personality traits that are exaggerated for humor and comic relief; the writers did not begin to take full comedic advantage of Monica&#x27;s neuroses until the show&#x27;s first Thanksgiving episode. The character is also the loudest of her friends. In her book &quot;Writing With Emotion, Tension, and Conflict: Techniques for Crafting an Expressive and Compelling Novel&quot;, author Cheryl St. John wrote that Monica exhibits qualities commonly associated with perfectionism and bossiness. James Tison of Bustle wrote that Monica&#x27;s cleanliness and bossiness often relinquishes her to being &quot;the lame one&quot; among her friends, although &quot;she proved that sometimes rules and responsibility were important&quot;. However, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Steve Weinstein observed that Monica&#x27;s actions often tend to contradict her &quot;Miss Perfect&quot; image and reputation, explaining that the character frequently &quot;makes a fool of herself&quot; in addition to being &quot;so compulsively neat that just her facial expressions of discomfort at one of her friends&#x27; messing things up in her apartment is enough to provoke genuine chuckles.&quot; Although several of Monica&#x27;s personality traits and mannerisms make the character a strong candidate for obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are treated as &quot;quirky and amusing&quot; as opposed to a disability or disease; her friends either ignore or find humor in her peculiarities.

As creator and writer, Kauffman confirmed that Monica&#x27;s extremely organized personality is based on her own, explaining, &quot;I have a lot of Monica in me, in terms of everything having to be a certain way.&quot; Writing about the development of Monica&#x27;s personality in &quot;USA Today&quot;, Robert Bianco observed that the character gradually evolves from &quot;the caring, nurturing mother figure ... into a slightly off-the-beam benevolent monarch.&quot; By the show&#x27;s final season, Monica&#x27;s personality has been &quot;exacerbated for comedy&quot; to the point of which she becomes borderline &quot;cartoonish&quot;.

=== Family and childhood; career and love life ===
Monica has a complicated relationship with her parents Jack (Elliott Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles), particularly with her &quot;hypercritical&quot; mother. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the character&#x27;s relationship with her parents &quot;esteem-sucking&quot;. Judy constantly criticizes her daughter&#x27;s appearance, career and love life, while acting much kinder towards Ross, whom she favors. Chelsea Mize of &quot;Bustle&quot; observed that Monica and Ross&#x27; &quot;wacky quirks become all the more understandable after ... seeing them with their parents.&quot; &quot;Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010&quot; author Vincent Terrance believes that Monica&#x27;s competitive nature originates from having grown up constantly competing with Ross. Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive described Monica and Ross&#x27; relationship as &quot;A blend of love and sibling jealousy with an urge to irritate each other to the deepest core of existence&quot;, with Ross often making fun of his sister&#x27;s weight and Monica teasing him about his several failed marriages in return. In terms of ethnicity, Crane confirmed that both Monica and Ross are half-Jewish, with their father being Jewish and their mother being of non-Jewish European ancestry. However, &quot;Television&#x27;s Changing Image of American Jews&quot; categorized Monica as a &quot;masked&quot; Jew, explaining that &quot;the smart, funny, and insecure Ross seems more Jewish&quot; than Monica, who the author dismissed as &quot;china-doll like&quot; in appearance and demeanor. In his book &quot;Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1&quot;, author Stephen Harlan Norwood agrees that, unlike the show&#x27;s male Jews, Monica&#x27;s Jewish &quot;markers&quot; have been virtually removed.
Although Monica and Rachel have remained best friends since high school, they are very much opposites. While both characters share similar economic backgrounds, they grew up on &quot;different ends of the high school social order&quot;, with Rachel being a popular cheerleader and Monica &quot;deal[ing] with body and control issues due to being an overweight child and teen.&quot; Sabienna Bowman of This Was TV observed that &quot;Monica&#x27;s struggles ultimately left her more confident than Rachel, as well as more prepared for adulthood.&quot; Among her defining qualities, Monica has had a passion for cooking ever since childhood, stemming from when she received her first Easy-Bake Oven. A chef, the character has had several cooking-related jobs throughout the series, having worked at five different restaurants, a trend that nearly coincides with her constant rotation of boyfriends in an ongoing search for the &quot;perfect match&quot;. Michael Hogan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; believes that the character&#x27;s &quot;competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her ideally suited to a career as a chef.&quot; However, in an episode where Monica goes through great lengths to impress her neighbors with her candy-making skills, it is revealed that Monica might have originally pursued cooking to get people to like her. In addition, her love of cooking and food is also responsible for her having been extremely overweight as a child, throughout high school and college. The running gag of an overweight Monica is often used as a recurring backstory for the character throughout the series, first explored in the second-season episode &quot;The One With the Prom Video&quot; via flashback. One of the character&#x27;s childhood nicknames was &quot;Big Fat Goalie&quot; when she played field hockey. While overweight, Monica is depicted as having very low self-esteem, binge eating often, and constantly seeking attention. While in college, Monica is embarrassed into losing weight permanently after overhearing her then-crush Chandler make fun of her appearance. &quot;Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection: Cosmetic Surgery, Weight Loss and Beauty in Popular Culture&quot; author Dr. Deborah Harris-Moore believes that Monica&#x27;s tendency to come off as a control freak originates from her childhood struggles with weight gain, explaining that the character ate excessively in order &quot;to cope with her emotions&quot;.

Possessing a very strong will, the character tends to exhibit outstanding perseverance when it comes to what she expects out of her relationships, jobs, and life in general, oftentimes refusing to settle for anything less than what satisfies her. Early in the series, Monica develops a reputation for experiencing bad luck and encountering rather unfortunate circumstances when it comes to dating, romantic relationships, and her love life. Nick at Nite joked that the character &quot;likes to keep things tidy in her home and love life, although the latter is a bit more difficult.&quot; This motif is frequently explored as a source of comic relief; the character&#x27;s friends would often &quot;pick apart&quot; her new dates and boyfriends. In his review of the series, David Hiltbrand of &quot;People&quot; referred to the character as &quot;an unlucky-in-love codependent&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Ken Parish Perkins observed that Monica &quot;often misfires when shooting for Mr. Right.&quot; According to Mike D&#x27;Avria of Splitsider, Monica &quot;never shied away from jumping into the sac with both random guys and people she worked with&quot; – among them a high school senior, an old high school crush, and an alcoholic – prior to dating Chandler, and of the show&#x27;s six main characters maintains the highest total of serious relationships. Cox described Monica as goofy, angry, and sarcastic, while referring to her as the show&#x27;s most sexually active character despite her &quot;goody two shoes&quot; image.

Out of &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; female characters, Monica&#x27;s style took the longest to establish. &quot;InStyle&quot; wrote that Monica&#x27;s combination of short, wavy hair and dark lipstick evoked &quot;a &#x27;90s take on &#x27;40s style.&quot; Ashley Hoffman of &quot;Styleite&quot; believes that her character initially &quot;dressed like a tourist trying to look like a New Yorker&quot;, frequently sporting jeans, overalls, and cargo shorts. With a wardrobe comprising dresses and pants equally, Monica&#x27;s fashion sense, much like Rachel and Phoebe&#x27;s, &quot;was a little bit normcore, a little bit corporate-casual.&quot; &quot;Elle&quot;&#x27;s Mahalia Chang observed that Monica did not follow trends of the time as much as Rachel, preferring to boast mom jeans, &quot;boxy&quot; sweaters, sneakers and flannels.

== Critical reception ==
Four months before its premiere, &quot;Friends&quot; failed NBC&#x27;s confidential research report, which cited the unlikeability of its six main characters as a possible factor. Although the report acknowledged Monica as the only character with whom test audiences identified somewhat positively, NBC admitted that reception towards the character was &quot;well below desirable levels for a lead&quot; nonetheless. In retrospect, &quot;The New Republic&#x27;s&quot; Andrew Harrison believes that although Monica and her friends &quot;were superficial, self-absorbed and at first difficult to like ... in their solipsism and neurosis they reflected and sent up the world emerging around them ... far more accurately than any conventional gooey-hearted family sitcom&quot;, ultimately &quot;creat[ing] a coffee-scented cocoon that millions wanted to enter&quot;. Reviews gradually improved; an early critical evaluation of &quot;Friends&quot;, which had pegged Cox as the show&#x27;s star, read, &quot;As Monica, [Cox] came across as charming, attractive, confident, and motivated – the leader of the group&quot;. While men found the actress attractive, women appreciated her sense of humor.

When &quot;Friends&quot; premiered in September 1994, critics initially perceived Monica as the show&#x27;s main character; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; Ken Tucker attributes this to the fact that Cox was the show&#x27;s most famous cast member at the time. The actress has garnered largely positive reviews for her performance, with Tucker concluding that Cox &quot;plays straight woman ... with alluring modesty&quot;. Tony Scott of &quot;Variety&quot; commended the entire cast for &quot;appear[ing] resourceful and display[ing] sharp sitcom skills ... especially Cox&quot;, while &quot;The Baltimore Sun&#x27;s&quot; David Zurawik described her acting as &quot;terrific&quot;. John Kiesewetter of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; praised Cox&#x27;s ability to &quot;deliver both verbal and physical comedy&quot;. Contactmusic.com&#x27;s Sophie Miskiw commended Cox for portraying Monica with &quot;endearing neurosis&quot;. As a character, Lifetime described Monica as &quot;neurotic yet lovable&quot;. &quot;Bustle&quot;&#x27;s Emma Lord wrote, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone wouldn&#x27;t want to be Monica Geller&quot;, describing her as a &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;savvy&quot; character. Despite admitting that Monica is &quot;probably not our favourite character&quot;, TalkTalk conceded that she is &quot;wonderfully neurotic&quot;, while Nick at Nite reviewed her as &quot;just as lovable as she is neurotic&quot;, despite her overbearing personality. Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was receptive towards the entire cast, especially Cox and her character, who he described as &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;likable and funny&quot;. Also writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Glenn Whipp lauded Cox&#x27;s tenure on &quot;Friends&quot;, enthusing that the actress successfully &quot;took a character loaded with obsessive-compulsive quirks and a goofy, overly competitive nature and fashioned a flesh-and-blood woman&quot;. Describing the actress&#x27; comic timing as &quot;impeccable&quot;, Whipp went on to write that Cox &quot;brought out Monica&#x27;s insecurities in a way that turned self-deprecation into an art form&quot;. Jenna Mullins of E! dubbed Cox &quot;a fantastic comedic actress&quot;. Alec Harvey of &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; described Monica as a &quot;very, very funny&quot; character. Kayla Upadhyaya of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; appreciated the fact that &quot;Cox brought moments of sincerity and severity to Monica&quot;. However, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; panned Cox&#x27;s performance as &quot;degrading&quot;, while Mike Ryan of ScreenCrush dismissed Monica as a &quot;fairly normal, but boring&quot; character.

In 1999, Cox was nominated for an American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Female Performer in a TV Series. Although continuously praised for her performance, Cox never received an Emmy Award nomination for her role on &quot;Friends&quot; during its entire run, although each of her five co-stars did. Both female castmates Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston remain the show&#x27;s only main cast members to have won the award, whose multiple nominations Cox especially &quot;had a hard time not taking ... personally&quot;, admitting to having been &quot;hurt&quot; by the snub. A number of media outlets cite Cox among several successful television actors whom they believe deserve but are yet to win an Emmy Award. The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; failure to acknowledge Cox prompted Jenna Mullins of E! to ask &quot;if Hollywood has something against honoring a fantastic comedic actress like Cox.&quot; In 2014, SheKnows Media published an article explaining five reasons author Rita Loiacono believes Monica is &quot;the best character on &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;, citing her cleanliness, bluntness and role as &quot;the heart of the group&quot;, among others. Loiacono enthused that Monica &quot;didn&#x27;t just have one defining aspect; she had many, and they were all equally hilarious. Not to mention, her ambition and vulnerability resulted in some of the show&#x27;s most touching and heartbreaking moments&quot;. Additionally, Loiacono dismissed the fact that Cox has never received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Monica as &quot;downright criminal&quot;. In 2015, HitFix wrote a similar article entitled &quot;5 Reasons Monica Geller is the Best &quot;Friends&quot; Friend&quot;, published in tandem with Cox&#x27;s 51 birthday. An article in &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; cited &quot;The One Where it All Began&quot;, &quot;The One With Two Parts: Part 2&quot;, &quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot;, &quot;The One with Chandler in a Box&quot;, &quot;The One with the Embryos&quot;, &quot;The One with All the Thanksgivings&quot;, &quot;The One Where Everybody Finds Out&quot;, &quot;The One On the Last Night&quot;, &quot;The One with the Proposal&quot;, &quot;The One with Monica and Chandler&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;The Last One&quot; among Monica&#x27;s best episodes; Cox herself acknowledged &quot;The One with the Embryos&quot; as her personal favorite. Meanwhile, BDCwire ranked &quot;The One with the Routine&quot;, &quot;The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress&quot;, &quot;The One with Monica&#x27;s Boots&quot;, &quot;The One with the Jellyfish&quot; and &quot;The One Where Monica Sings&quot; among the character&#x27;s best.

Despite consistently warm reception towards Cox and her character, some aspects of Monica&#x27;s characterization have been criticized. The second season episode &quot;The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies&quot; sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment in order to have sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book &quot;Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice&quot;, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica&#x27;s overweight alter-ego &quot;Fat Monica&quot; has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. While identifying a formerly overweight character as &quot;a standard TV trope&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&#x27;s&quot; Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica &quot;always struck a weird note&quot; with the writer despite the show&#x27;s efforts &quot;to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character&quot;. Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show&#x27;s fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, &quot;What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn&#x27;t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn&#x27;t get to be the protagonist.&quot; Emma Tarver of Feminspire reflected that Fat Monica &quot;made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at.&quot; Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as &quot;proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too&quot;. In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show&#x27;s episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.

== Legacy ==

=== Impact and commendations ===
According to &quot;Elle&quot;, the combined popularity of Monica and Cox established them both as television icons during the 1990s. Additionally, baby name books commonly associate the name &quot;Monica&quot; with the character. As the role in which Cox &quot;found fame&quot;, Monica remains the actress&#x27; most iconic performance to-date, as well as the role for which she is best known. &quot;Us Weekly&quot; believes that Cox &quot;made television history during her 10 year stint playing Monica&quot;. Meanwhile, Steve Weinstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; credits Cox&#x27;s comedic performance with helping dispel stereotypes that &quot;Pretty women aren&#x27;t supposed to be funny&quot;. In 1995, one year after &quot;Friends&quot; premiered, Cox appeared on the cover of &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; issue. According to &quot;Alabama Biographical Dictionary&quot; author Jan Onofrio, Monica helped &quot;put [Cox] in the television spotlight and provided offers for more desirable roles.&quot; The &quot;Daily News&quot; deemed Cox &quot;one of the more successful &#x27;Friends&#x27; since the show ended&quot; thanks to her consistent television and film roles. By both starring in and producing the sitcom &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, which has been reviewed as her &quot;best gig since&quot; ... Friends&quot;&quot;, Cox became the series&#x27; first main cast member to achieve long-term television success post-&quot;Friends&quot;.

According to a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; poll, industry professionals – actors, writers and directors – voted Monica the 47th best fictional female character. ChaCha collectively ranked Phoebe, Rachel and Monica the 11th, 12th and 13th best female television characters of all time. Maria Tallarico of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; observed that a number of Monica&#x27;s storylines, including one in which she unintentionally has sex with a high school senior, &quot;probably wouldn&#x27;t fly on TV today&quot;. Writing for Mic.com, Samantha Allen believes that Monica helped &quot;set the standard for how sitcoms could and would talk about sex&quot; by both engaging in casual sex and dating a much older man. According to Dustin Levy of &quot;The Diamondback&quot;, Monica inspired &quot;any ensemble cast in a sitcom with a female character who is bossy or neurotic&quot;, citing &quot;Scrubs&quot;″ Elliot Reid and &quot;Happy Endings&quot;″ Jane Kerkovich-Williams as examples of Monica&#x27;s influence. Additionally, Levy identified Claire Dunphy from the sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot; as Monica&#x27;s modern-day successor, explaining that the character &quot;acts like Monica plus children&quot;. In spring 2015, &quot;TV Guide&quot; published an article entitled &quot;22 Spring Cleaning Tips From Monica Geller&quot; in tribute to the character&#x27;s cleanliness. In her article &quot;5 Signs You&#x27;re A Real-Life Monica Geller&quot;, Ayn Bernos of &quot;Thought Catalog&quot; identified the character&#x27;s personality as the reason &quot;all perfectionist fans of this iconic TV show have asked themselves this question at least once in their life: &#x27;Oh my god, am I a Monica Geller?!&#x27;&quot; Emma Lord of &quot;Bustle&quot; expounded in her article &quot;13 Signs You Are The Monica Of Your Friend Group&quot; &quot;that isn&#x27;t to say life is easy for the Real Life Monicas of the world. First, there&#x27;s all the name calling: &#x27;neat freak&#x27; and &#x27;sore loser&#x27;, to name a few. Second, all of your elaborate, carefully-laid plans inevitably go haywire when people around you don&#x27;t respect the obvious beauty and rightness of them.&quot; According to Patricia Murphy of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Monica &quot;is most definitely one of the most famous fictional telly chefs&quot;, expounding, &quot;her OCD combined with her continuous strive for perfection making her a thoroughly enjoyable watch.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked Monica fifth on the newspaper&#x27;s list of &quot;The 10 best fictional chefs&quot;, while &quot;People&quot; ranked the character eighth, with author Grace Gavilanes writing, &quot;She&#x27;s the best kind of chef – neurotic in the most entertaining/productive way, and &quot;always&quot; cleans up the mess in her kitchen.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler&#x27;s relationship and their wedding in the episode &quot;The One With Monica and Chandler&#x27;s Wedding&quot; with saving &quot;Friends&quot;. Prior to the episode, the show had &quot;appeared to be in serious danger of out-staying its welcome.&quot; Although admitting that the overall episode &quot;is not one of &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; best&quot;, Bianco explained that &quot;The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion.&quot; While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest &quot;Friends&quot; couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine a time when Monica and Chandler weren&#x27;t together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be.&quot; Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica&#x27;s best boyfriend, awarding him an &#x27;A&#x27; grade. Gerstenberger penned, &quot;I would not be able to face myself every day if I did not rank Chandler the best of Monica&#x27;s boyfriends from &quot;Friends.&quot; The two ended up getting married, which just goes to show that some one night stands are meant to last.&quot; Monica and Ross&#x27; relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters &quot;provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find a best friend in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship.&quot; PopSugar ranked Monica and Ross fifth on the website&#x27;s list of &quot;The 9 Best Sibling Relationships From &#x27;90s TV&quot;

Immediately established as one of the show&#x27;s primary settings, Monica&#x27;s large Greenwich Village apartment has since become one of the most famous and iconic television sets in history. Steffani Cameron of BuildDirect wrote that Monica&#x27;s &quot;apartment was unlike anything else on TV. It was full of color, clutter, and personality. It was a space cobbled together of kitsch and class, and it was just magic&quot;, citing its windows, color and openness among her favourite things about the apartment. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine ranked it among the &quot;12 Best Apartments on TV&quot;. Chloe Daley of Refinery29 joked that the apartment serves as both &quot;a lesson in how to decorate with purple&quot; and &quot;a lesson in how &quot;not&quot; to&quot;. Based on its total number of bedrooms, open kitchen concept, large living space and balcony, real estate agent Sydney Blumstein estimates that the apartment would be worth approximately 2.3 million in 2015. In terms of its size and affordability, the apartment has frequently been the subject of scrutiny; critics constantly question how Monica, a chef, and Rachel, a waitress, were able to afford such a luxurious home based on their relatively low incomes, often dismissing the show&#x27;s explanation that this is due to an illegal sublet courtesy of Monica&#x27;s grandmother who moved to Florida. Hollywood.com&#x27;s Abbey Stone ranked it television&#x27;s 10th &quot;most ridiculous&quot; apartment, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot; placed it at number four in a similar article.

=== Wardrobe and fashion ===
&quot;Friends&quot;″ female characters had a profound influence on women&#x27;s fashion during the 1990s, becoming fashion icons in addition and household names, in addition to inspiring a generation of women. According to Desiree Tolentino of &quot;Verge Campus&quot;, &quot;Rachel and Monica were THE fashion icons back in the day&quot;, writing, &quot;Monica Geller&#x27;s vivacious style and sex appeal inspires every girl to care just a little bit more about what they wear&quot;. TheTalko contributor Taylor Hodgkins agreed that both Rachel &quot;and Monica ... became cultural icons ... due to the fact the characters became fashion icons ... For those of us who thought of ourselves to be fashion mavens, we loved to tune into Friends to see what Monica and Rachel had in their closets week after week.&quot; Describing Monica&#x27;s wardrobe as &quot;classic and elegant&quot;, &quot;Stylist&quot; observed that the character&#x27;s first season bob cut was imitated by several woman, although its popularity paled in comparison to that of Aniston&#x27;s iconic &quot;Rachel&quot; haircut, the widespread success of which Cox was jealous. However, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; identified Monica&#x27;s hairstyle as &quot;Iconic in its own right&quot;, including in its list of &quot;20 iconic Friends hairstyles&quot;. Monica also became well known for accessorizing sweaters using scarves; on Cox&#x27;s 51st birthday in 2015, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; published an article celebrating her character&#x27;s best sweaters. BuzzFeed ranked Monica&#x27;s wedding dress seventh on the website&#x27;s list of the &quot;28 TV Show Wedding Dresses You&#x27;ll Always Envy&quot;, while &quot;Brides&quot; ranked it the ninth greatest wedding dress in television history. &quot;Us Weekly&quot; included it on their list of &quot;Celebrity Wedding Dresses: TV &amp; Movies&quot;. Lauren Bravo of &quot;Grazia&quot; wrote that although &quot;It&#x27;s hard for us to process some of Monica&#x27;s early outfits ... there&#x27;s a lot of great stuff to be pilfered from Monica&#x27;s pleasingly preppy wardrobe&quot;, despite its heavy tailoring. Meanwhile, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; cited several of Monica&#x27;s outfits and hairstyles among the newspaper&#x27;s list of &quot;Friends best fashion moments&quot;.

In recent years, fans&#x27; appreciation for Monica&#x27;s wardrobe has grown following the series&#x27; availability on Netflix, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Jess Cartner-Morley observing that audiences &quot;were all too busy admiring Rachel&#x27;s hair and Chandler&#x27;s jokes first time around to notice Monica Geller&#x27;s love of mom jeans and hair barrettes. But the world has finally caught up with the poster girl for 90s normcore&quot;, to the point at which it rivals Rachel&#x27;s. Crowning her the &quot;unlikely style icon&quot; of summer 2019, Cartner-Morley observed the characters&#x27; influence on the outfits of several celebrities, namely Bella Hadid and Harry Styles. The writer also coined this revival &quot;The Monaissance&quot; due to the character &quot;unexpectedly [finding] a breakout role as a style icon&quot;, and citing the character parting her hair to the side using a barrette, ribbed vests, high-waisted mom jeans, pale denim straight-fit jeans and white trainers among fashion trends that have been adopted by modern-day viewers. The newspaper credits Monica&#x27;s popularity to audience&#x27;s revived interest in cooking shows. While comparing Styles&#x27; fashion choices to Monica&#x27;s wardrobe, Ben Boskovich of &quot;Esquire&quot; named the character the &quot;most stylish&quot; of &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; main characters and &quot;a menswear icon ahead of her time&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Business Insider&quot; compiled a list of Monica&#x27;s 16 most iconic outfits, with author Paige Bennett writing &quot;As a professional chef, Monica had to adhere to a strict dress code at work but when the apron came off, Monica donned a sleek yet down-to-earth wardrobe that can still be appreciated today.&quot; &quot;Elle&quot; named Monica &quot;The Best-Dressed Character On &#x27;Friends&#x27;&quot; in what Mahalia Chang called a controversial, &quot;potentially-unpopular opinion&quot; as most fans give this designation to Rachel.

<text>The Beijing Municipal Administration &amp; Communication Card (), more commonly known as the Yikatong (literally One-card pass), is a stored-value contactless smart card used in Beijing, China, for public transportation and related uses. It is similar to the Octopus card in Hong Kong, CEPAS in Singapore, the OMNY card in New York City, or the Oyster card in London.

== History ==
After smart card pilot projects proved successful, Yikatong was introduced at the end of 2003 on Beijing subway Line 13 and certain bus routes. Initially, the card was not widely adopted by passengers because of its limited usefulness, the relatively high deposit, and its lack of availability. Beginning on 10 May 2006, Beijing&#x27;s entire subway system and all Beijing buses began to accept the card, which replaced the traditional paper monthly passes. At the same time, the purchase and recharging of cards became possible at many more commercial outlets. While some passengers initially complained about long queues at bus stops, the system was adopted by increasing numbers of people. On 16 May 2006, 4,471,800 transactions were made using Yikatong.

The system was introduced on some taxis in 2006 and, from the beginning of August 2008, all Beijing taxis were required to accept Yikatong for fare payment. The system was expected to be further expanded for payments of parking fees and expressway tolls.

By the end of 2011, 41.76 million Yikatong cards had been issued.

Beginning in 2022, the Yikatong card was mandated to be tied to an individual&#x27;s Beijing Health Kit as a way to further enforce China&#x27;s Zero-COVID efforts and its associated regular testing. This policy has remained despite the end of Zero-COVID, meaning foreigners without a Chinese National ID or Permanent Resident ID plus a mainland Chinese mobile phone number (i.e. visitor with only a passport) are unable to purchase and top up a Yikatong from an automated kiosk, and must transact at a staffed cashier booth.

== Cost ==
The card can be purchased with a deposit of CNY 20, and can be bought at most ticket counters at Beijing Subway stations and some bus stations. The deposit is used to cover insufficient funds for a single trip, and can be refunded when the card is returned. The card may be topped up in multiples of CNY 10 up to a maximum of CNY 1000. A Yikatong retains its value for up to three years after its last activity.

When paying by the Yikatong card, passengers get 50% off the normal bus fare within the municipality, except on some special purpose routes with a flat fare. Yikatong offers no discount on subway or taxi fares. Unlimited metro (excluding the Capital and Daxing Airport Express lines) and bus ride passes are available for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7-day validities.

<text>J. (Jack) C. Higginbotham (May 11, 1906 – May 26, 1973) was an American jazz trombonist. His playing was robust and swinging.

==Biography==
He was born in Social Circle, Georgia, United States, and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. In the 1930s and 1940s, he played with some of the premier swing bands, including Luis Russell&#x27;s, Benny Carter&#x27;s, Red Allen&#x27;s, Chick Webb&#x27;s, Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s, and Mills Blue Rhythm Band. He also played with Louis Armstrong, who had taken over Russell&#x27;s band from 1937 to 1940. From 1947 on, he chiefly led his own groups. He recorded extensively both as a sideman and as a leader. He played for a long period in the 1940s with his ideal partner Red Allen, and then disappeared from the scene for several years.

Higginbotham led several bands in the 1950s in Boston and Cleveland, appeared regularly at the Metropole in New York between 1956 and 1959, and led his own Dixieland band there in the 1960s. He also appeared on the DuMont series &quot;Jazz Party&quot; (1958), aired on WNTA-TV.

During the tenure with Luis Russell on February 5, 1930, a single session was issued under the name of J.C. Higgenbotham and His Six Hicks was issued on OKeh 8772, featuring &quot;Give Me Your Telephone Number&quot; and &quot;Higgenbotham Blues.&quot; Musicians included Henry Allen, Higgenbotham, Charlie Holmes, Luis Russell, Will Hognson, Pops Foster and Paul Barbarin, all member of Russell&#x27;s band.

He went on his first European tour with Sammy Price, appearing in Scandinavia, and worked once again briefly in 1964 with Louis Armstrong.

He died on May 26, 1973, in Manhattan, New York City, at Harlem Hospital.

<doc id="827359" wikidata="Q1434492" url="?curid=827359" title="Immigration Act of 1924">
<text>The Immigration Act of 1924, or Johnson–Reed Act, including the Asian Exclusion Act and National Origins Act (), was a United States federal law that prevented immigration from Asia and set quotas on the number of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. It also authorized the creation of the country&#x27;s first formal border control service, the U.S. Border Patrol, and established a &quot;consular control system&quot; that allowed entry only to those who first obtained a visa from a U.S. consulate abroad. 

The 1924 act was passed due to growing public and political concerns about the country&#x27;s fast-changing social and demographic landscape. It replaced earlier legislation by significantly reducing immigration from countries outside the Western hemisphere. Immigrants from Asia were banned, and the total annual immigration quota for the rest of the world was capped at 165,000—an 80% reduction of the yearly average before 1914. The act temporarily reduced the annual quota of any nationality from 3% of their 1910 population, per the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, to 2% as recorded in the 1890 census; a new quota was implemented in 1927, based on each nationality&#x27;s share of the total U.S. population in the 1920 census, which would govern U.S. immigration policy until 1965.

According to the Department of State, the purpose of the act was &quot;to preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity.&quot; The 1924 act would define U.S. immigration policy for nearly three decades, until being substantially revised by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and ultimately replaced by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

==Context==
The Naturalization Act of 1790 declared that only people of European or white descent were eligible for naturalization, but eligibility was extended to people of African descent in the Naturalization Act of 1870. Chinese and Japanese laborers and were barred from immigrating to the U.S. in the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1907, respectively.

A limitation on Eastern and Southern European immigration was first proposed in 1896 in the form of the literacy test bill. Henry Cabot Lodge was confident the bill would provide an indirect measure of reducing emigration from these countries, but after passing both houses of Congress, it was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. Another proposal for immigration restriction was introduced again in 1909 by U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. The Immigration Act of 1917 restricted immigration further in a variety of ways. It increased restrictions on Asian immigration, raised the general immigrant head tax, excluded those deemed to be diseased or mentally unwell, and in light of intense lobbying by the Immigration Restriction League, introduced the literacy test for all new immigrants to prove their ability to read English. In the wake of the post–World War I recession, many Americans believed that bringing in more immigrants would worsen the unemployment rate. The First Red Scare of 1919–1921 had fueled fears of foreign radicals migrating to undermine American values and provoke an uprising like the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The number of immigrants entering the United States decreased for about a year from July 1919 to June 1920 but doubled in the year after that.

U.S. Representative Albert Johnson, a eugenics advocate, and Senator David Reed were the two main architects of the act. They conceived the act as a bulwark against &quot;a stream of alien blood&quot;; it likewise found support among xenophobic and nativist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. However, some proponents, such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL), welcomed the act for reducing cheap immigrant labor that would compete with local workers. Both public and Congressional opposition was minimal. In the wake of intense lobbying, it passed with strong congressional support. There were nine dissenting votes in the Senate and a handful of opponents in the House of Representatives, the most vigorous of whom was freshman Brooklyn Representative Emanuel Celler, a Jewish American. Decades later, he pointed out the act&#x27;s &quot;startling discrimination against central, eastern and southern Europe.&quot;

Proponents of the act sought to establish a distinct American identity by preserving its ethnic homogeneity. Reed told the Senate that earlier legislation &quot;disregards entirely those of us who are interested in keeping American stock up to the highest standard—that is, the people who were born here.&quot; He believed that immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, most of whom were Catholics or Jews, arrived sick and starving, were less capable of contributing to the American economy, and were unable to adapt to American culture. Eugenics was used as justification for the act&#x27;s restriction of certain races or ethnicities of people to prevent the spread of perceived feeblemindedness in American society. Samuel Gompers, himself a Jewish immigrant from Britain and the founder of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), supported the act because he opposed the cheap labor that immigration represented even though the act would sharply reduce Jewish immigration. Both the AFL and the Ku Klux Klan supported the act. Historian John Higham concludes: &quot;Klan backing made no material difference. Congress was expressing the will of the nation.&quot;.
Lobbyists from the West Coast, where a majority of Japanese, Korean, and other East Asian immigrants had settled, were especially concerned with excluding Asian immigrants. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act had already slowed Chinese immigration, but as Japanese andto a lesser degreeKorean and Filipino laborers began arriving and putting down roots in Western United States, an exclusionary movement formed in reaction to the &quot;Yellow Peril.&quot; Valentine S. McClatchy, the founder of The McClatchy Company and a leader of the anti-Japanese movement, argued, &quot;They come here specifically and professedly for the purpose of colonizing and establishing here permanently the proud Yamato race.&quot; He cites their supposed inability to assimilate to American culture and the economic threat that they posed to white businessmen and farmers.

Opposing the act, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes said, &quot;The legislation would seem to be quite unnecessary, even for the purpose for which it is devised.&quot; The act faced strong opposition from the Japanese government with which the U.S. government had maintained a cordial economic and political relationship. In Japan, the bill was called by some the &quot;Japanese Exclusion&quot; act. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsui Keishirō instructed the Japanese ambassador to the U.S., Masanao Hanihara, to write to Hughes:
Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette, who did not vote on the bill, in a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, said that the bill would have to be revisioned &quot;to make its operation simple, humane, and free from the misery and disappointment to which would-be immigrants are now subjected.&quot;

Members of the Senate interpreted Hanihara&#x27;s phrase &quot;grave consequences&quot; as a threat, which was used by hardliners of the bill to fuel both houses of Congress to vote for it. Because 1924 was an election year, and he was unable to form a compromise, President Calvin Coolidge declined to use his veto power to block the act, although both houses passed it by a veto-overriding two-thirds majority. The act was signed into law on May 24, 1924.

==Provisions==
The immigration act made permanent the basic limitations on immigration to the United States established in 1921 and modified the National Origins Formula, which had been established in that year. In conjunction with the Immigration Act of 1917, it governed American immigration policy until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which revised it completely, was passed.

The act provided that no alien ineligible to become a citizen could be admitted to the U.S. as an immigrant. That was aimed primarily at Japanese aliens, although they were not explicitly named in the act. It imposed fines on transportation companies who landed aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law. It defined the term &quot;immigrant&quot; and designated all other alien entries into the U.S. as &quot;non-immigrant,&quot; or temporary visitors. It also established classes of admission for such non-immigrants.

The act set a total immigration quota of 165,000 for countries outside the Western Hemisphere, an 80% reduction from average before World War I, and barred immigrants from Asia, including Japan. However, the Philippines was then a U.S. colony and so its citizens were U.S. nationals and could thus travel freely to the U.S. The act did not include China since it was already barred under the Chinese Exclusion Act.

The 1924 act reduced the annual quota of any nationality from 3% of their 1910 population (as defined by the Emergency Quota Act of 1921) to 2% of the number of foreign-born persons of any nationality residing in the U.S. according to the 1890 census. A more recent census existed, but at the behest of a eugenics subcommittee chaired by eugenicist Madison Grant, Congress used the 1890 one to increase immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and to decrease those from Eastern and Southern Europe. According to &quot;Commonweal&quot;, the act &quot;relied on false nostalgia for a census that only seemed to depict a homogenous, Northern European–descended nation: in reality, 15 percent of the nation were immigrants in 1890.&quot;

The 1890-based quotas were set to last until 1927, when they would be replaced by of a total annual quota of 150,000, proportional to the national origins figures from the 1920 census. However, this did little to diversify the nations from which immigrants came because the 1920 census did not include Blacks, Mulattos, and Asians as part of the American population used for the quotas. The lowest quota per country was 100 individuals, but even then only those eligible for citizenship could immigrate to the U.S. (i.e. only whites in China could immigrate). Establishing national origin quotas for the country proved to be a difficult task, and was not accepted and completed until 1929. The act gave 85% of the immigration quota to Northern and Western Europe and those who had an education or had a trade. The other 15% went disproportionately to Eastern and Southern Europe.

The act established preferences under the quota system for certain relatives of U.S. residents, including their unmarried children under 21, their parents, and spouses at least 21 and over. It also preferred immigrants at least 21 who were skilled in agriculture and their wives and dependent children under 16. Non-quota status was accorded to wives and unmarried children under 18 of U.S. citizens; natives of Western Hemisphere countries, with their families; non-immigrants; and certain others.

Subsequent amendments eliminated certain elements of the law&#x27;s discrimination against women, but this was not more fully achieved until 1952.

===Quota calculation formula===
The 1924 act provided that census data from 1920 would determine the quotas beginning in . The Bureau of the Census and Department of Commerce estimated the &quot;National Origins of the White Population of the United States in 1920&quot; in numbers, then calculated the percentage share each nationality made up. The National Origins Formula derived quotas by calculating the equivalent proportion of each nationality out of a total pool of 150,000 annual quota immigrants, with a minimum quota of 100. This formula was used until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 adopted a simplified formula limiting each country to a flat quota of one-sixth of one percent of that nationality&#x27;s 1920 population count, with a minimum quota of 100.
===Quotas by country under successive laws===
Listed below are historical quotas on emigration from the Eastern Hemisphere, by country, as applied in given fiscal years ending June 30, calculated according to successive immigration laws and revisions from the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 to the final quota year of 1965. The 1922 and 1925 systems based on dated census records of the foreign-born population were intended as temporary measures; the 1924 Act&#x27;s National Origins Formula based on the 1920 census of the total U.S. population took effect on July 1, 1929. 

==Visas and border control==
The act also established the &quot;consular control system&quot; of immigration, which divided responsibility for immigration between the U.S. State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The act also mandated no alien to be allowed to enter the U.S. without a valid immigration visa issued by an American consular officer abroad.

Consular officers were now allowed to issue visas to eligible applicants, but the number of visas to be issued by each consulate annually was limited, and no more than 10% of the quota could be given out in any one month. Aliens were not able to leave their home countries before having a valid visa, as opposed to the old system of deporting them at ports of debarkation. That gave a double layer of protection to the border since if they were found to be inadmissible, immigrants could still be deported on arrival.

===Establishment of Border Patrol===
The National Origins Act authorized the formation of the United States Border Patrol, which was established two days after the act was passed, primarily to guard the Mexico–United States border. A $10 tax was imposed on Mexican immigrants, who were allowed to continue immigrating based on their perceived willingness to provide cheap labor.

==Results==
The act was seen in a negative light in Japan, causing resignations of ambassadors and protests. A citizen committed &quot;seppuku&quot; near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo with a note that read: &quot;Appealing to the American people&quot;. American businesses situated in Japan suffered the economic brunt of the legislation&#x27;s repercussions, as the Japanese government subsequently increased tariffs on American trading by &#x27;100 per cent&#x27;.

Passage of the Immigration Act has been credited with ending a growing democratic movement in Japan during this time period, and opening the door to Japanese militarist government control. According to David C. Atkinson, on the Japanese government&#x27;s perception of the act, &quot;this indignity is seen as a turning point in the growing estrangement of the U.S. and Japan, which culminated in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor&quot;.

The act&#x27;s revised formula reduced total emigration from 357,803 between 1923 and 1924 to 164,667 between 1924 and 1925. The law&#x27;s impact varied widely by country. Emigration from Great Britain and Ireland fell 19%, while emigration from Italy fell more than 90%. From 1901 to 1914, 2.9 million Italians immigrated, an average of 210,000 per year. Under the 1924 quota, only 4,000 per year were allowed since the 1890 quota counted only 182,580 Italians in the U.S. By contrast, the annual quota for Germany after the passage of the act was over 55,000 since German-born residents in 1890 numbered 2,784,894. Germany, Britain, and Ireland had the highest representation in 1890. The provisions of the act were so restrictive that in 1924 more Italians, Czechs, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Poles, Portuguese, Romanians, Spaniards, Chinese, and Japanese left the U.S. than arrived as immigrants.

During World War II, the U.S. modified the act to set immigration quotas for their allies in China. The immigration quotas were eased in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and replaced in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

===Jewish migration===
The law sharply curtailed emigration from countries that were previously host to the vast majority of the Jews in the U.S., almost 75% of whom emigrated from Russia alone. Because Eastern European immigration did not become substantial until the late 19th century, the law&#x27;s use of the population of the U.S. in 1890 as the basis for calculating quotas effectively made mass migration from Eastern Europe, where the vast majority of the Jewish diaspora lived at the time, impossible. In 1929, the quotas were adjusted to one-sixth of 1% of the 1920 census figures, and the overall immigration limit reduced to 150,000.

The act was seen as causing many Jews to instead immigrate to mandatory Palestine, spurring the Fourth Aliyah. In 1937, the Peel Commission noted the act spurred immigration levels not anticipated during the drafting of the 1922 Mandate for Palestine.

The law was not modified to aid the flight of Jewish refugees in the 1930s or 1940s despite the rise of Nazi Germany. The quotas were adjusted to allow more Jewish refugees after World War II, but without increasing immigration overall.

==Legacy==
The act has been characterized as the culmination of decades of intentional exclusion of Asian immigrants.

The act had negative economic effects. Economists have argued that both innovation and employment were negatively affected by the restrictions. In a 2020 paper, the economists Petra Moser and Shmuel San demonstrated that the drastic reduction in immigration from Eastern and Southern European scientists led to fewer new patents, not only from immigrants but also from native-born scientists working in their fields. Even the mass migration of unskilled workers had been a spur to innovation, according to a paper by Kirk Doran and Chungeun Yoon, who found &quot;using variation induced by 1920s quotas, which ended history&#x27;s largest international migration&quot; that &quot;inventors in cities and industries exposed to fewer low-skilled immigrants applied for fewer patents.&quot; Nor did US-born workers benefit, according to a 2023 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal.&quot; Farming, a sector of the economy highly reliant on migrant labor, shifted towards more capital-intensive forms of agriculture, whereas the mining industry, another immigrant-reliant industry, contracted.

Looking back on the significance of the act, Harry Laughlin, the eugenicist who served as expert advisor to the House Committee on Immigration during the legislative process, praised it as a political breakthrough in the adoption of scientific racism as a theoretical foundation for immigration policy. Due to the reliance upon eugenics in forming the policy, and growing public reception towards scientific racism as justification for restriction and racial stereotypes by 1924, the act has been seen as a piece of legislation that formalized the views of contemporary U.S. society. Historian Mae Ngai writes of the national origins quota system:

At one level, the new immigration law differentiated Europeans according to nationality and ranked them in a hierarchy of desirability. At another level, the law constructed a White American race, in which persons of European descent shared a common Whiteness distinct from those deemed to be not White. 

In 1928, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler praised the act for banishing &quot;strangers of the blood&quot;. U.S. immigration law was cited favorably by the framers of Nazi legislation due to its excluding &quot;wholly foreign racial population masses&quot;.

<text>James Reginald Cordy (born January 2, 1950) is a Canadian computer scientist and educator who is Professor Emeritus in the School of Computing at Queen&#x27;s University. As a researcher he is most recently active in the fields of source code analysis and manipulation, software reverse and re-engineering, and pattern analysis and machine intelligence. He has a long record of previous work in programming languages, compiler technology, and software architecture.

He is best known for his work on the TXL source transformation language, a parser-based framework and functional programming language designed to support software analysis and transformation tasks originally developed with M.Sc. student Charles Halpern-Hamu in 1985 as a tool for experimenting with programming language design. His recent work on the NICAD clone detector with Ph.D. student Chanchal Roy, the Recognition Strategy Language with Ph.D. student Richard Zanibbi and Dorothea Blostein, the Cerno lightweight natural language understanding system with John Mylopoulos and others at the University of Trento, and the SIMONE model clone detector with Manar Alalfi, Thomas R. Dean, Matthew Stephan and Andrew Stevenson is based on TXL.

The 1995 paper A Syntactic Theory of Software Architecture with Ph.D. student Thomas R. Dean has been widely cited as a seminal work in the area, and led to his work with Thomas R. Dean, Kevin A. Schneider and Andrew J. Malton on legacy systems analysis.

Work in programming languages included the design of Concurrent Euclid (1980) and Turing (1983), with R.C. Holt, and the implementation of the Euclid (1978) and SP/k (1974) languages with R.C. Holt, D.B. Wortman, D.T. Barnard and others. As part of these projects he developed the S/SL compiler technology with R.C. Holt and D.B. Wortman based on his M.Sc. thesis work and the orthogonal code generation method based on his Ph.D. thesis work.

He has co-authored or co-edited the books The Turing Programming Language: Design and Definition (1988), Introduction to Compiler Construction Using S/SL (1986), The Smart Internet (2010), and The Personal Web (2013).

From 2002 to 2007 he was the Director of the Queen&#x27;s School of Computing. In 2008 he was elected a Distinguished Scientist of the Association for Computing Machinery. He is a prolific academic supervisor and in 2008 was recognized with the Queen&#x27;s University Award of Excellence in Graduate Supervision. In 2016 he won the Queen&#x27;s University Prize for Excellence in Research. In 2019 he was recognized with the CS-Can/Info-Can Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Clare is a market town and civil parish on the north bank of the River Stour in the West Suffolk district, in the county of Suffolk, England. Clare is in southwest Suffolk, from Bury St Edmunds and from Sudbury. Clare won Village of the Year in 2010 and Anglia in Bloom award for Best Large Village 2011 for its floral displays in 2011. In March 2015, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and Zoopla placed Clare amongst the top 50 UK rural locations, having &quot;period properties and rich history without the chocolate-box perfection – and the coach trips&quot;. In 2011 it had a population of 2028.

Clare and its vicinity has evidence of human habitation throughout prehistory, through the Norman Conquest, to the present day.

The town hosts Stour Valley Community School, one of the first free schools established by the government, opened in September 2011.

== Geology ==
This area of the country was formed during the Tertiary period, containing some of the youngest rock in the British Isles. Like the vast majority of Suffolk, the surface &#x27;rock&#x27; is the very fertile boulder clay or clay loam, lying on top of layers of chalk. The landscape surrounding the Stour Valley is the result of the joint effects of past glaciation and the agricultural alteration of the land. Originally the area was under the sea; the shells of the sea creatures dropped to bed of the ocean and formed into chalk about 140 million years ago. Another mineral, silica, filled the sponges and other similar animals in the sea. As this was left behind it formed nodules of hard flint. 

A ridge of Cretaceous chalk left by the ancient sea juts into Suffolk from Cambridgeshire. This ridge is never more than 140 metres above sea level but it makes what is called High Suffolk. This chalk layer forms the so-called solid rock layer. This chalk was originally quarried where it came to the surface, and was either burned to produce agricultural lime or was mixed with sand, quarried locally, for mortar used in building (hence the presence of cream bricks (&#x27;Suffolk whites&#x27;) for houses in the area). Chalk in the water makes it &#x27;hard&#x27; (classified as &#x27;very hard; 511 mg/L as calcium carbonate) according to Anglian Water&#x27;s water quality.

During the Ice Age, the sea level was some 200 metres lower than it is today. Melt water carried debris and flowed beneath the glacier under high pressure, to produce tunnel valleys, deeply incised water routes. At Clare it is as far as 110 metres below our present sea level. The valley was subsequently filled with boulder clay and gravel. The ice sheet, which produced the chalky boulder clay, rolled upon a bed of glacial sand and gravel, and formed the flattened character of the area today.

The main river running through the country park is not the Stour. This is a mill stream called the &#x27;new cut&#x27;, established to operate a mill belonging to the priory, in use in the 14th century. It is joined at the eastern end of the country park by the Chilton stream. This itself is fed by the Hawedych, and by another stream coming down from Poslingford. The smaller Stour now runs south of the country park, meandering around the priory and meadows.

== Governance ==
In 1894 Clare became part of Clare Rural District which became part of the administrative county of West Suffolk in 1889. In 1974 Clare became part of St Edmundsbury district in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. In 2019 Clare became part of West Suffolk district.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

Paleolithic implements were discovered within the Priory grounds. A Mesolithic quartzite pebble macehead was found in the same location. A Neolithic stone axe was retrieved from the River Stour; a polished flint axe in a gravel pit to the east and a flint head in a meadow just off the Ashen Road. A Neolithic flint arrowhead was found in a garden on Bridewell Street. A Neolithic long mortuary enclosure and three Bronze Age barrows were located across the river towards Ashen. Evidence of a barrow together with 200 worked flints were found near Chilton Street. A Bronze Age socketed gouge was unearthed from plough soil on the Common. There are some 24 other pre-Iron Age structures in the parishes around Clare which may be located via Google Maps.

An Iron Age pot was found embedded in the river bank, half a mile east of Clare. Together with an iron spearhead, they are held in The Ancient House. Iron Age coins have also been found, one from the Belgic Trinovantes tribe. In 2009 during a recent rebuilding programme at Clare Community Primary School, postholes of a late Bronze/Early Iron Age structure were located, with an associated ring ditch. This supports the view that Clare Camp (OS TL768458, at the north end of the town, just behind Bridewell Street) with its double ditches, one of the most impressive of its kind in Suffolk, is from that period; with an area of 2.9 hectares, it is second only to Burgh Castle. It is now entered into the Atlas of Hillforts. The north side is most complete, with an inner rampart 9 ft high and counterscarps 12 and 14 ft high. In 1993 a field survey and magnetometric scan revealed the possibility of entrances on the east and south sides. Clare was on the outer borders of the Trinovantes territory, just south of the Iceni. The camp probably marks the first permanent settlement in the area.

=== Roman ===
A Roman boundary ditch and posthole has been found just off Nethergate Street; a strap fitting, coins, sepulchral urns and a bronze figurine of Mercury or a dancing boy have been unearthed in various locations. Some Roman brick seems to have ended up in the Parish Church.

There were substantial settlements to the west at Wixoe and to the east at Long Melford. Archaeological digs and magnetic survey at Wixoe, as part of the Abberton pipeline installation, revealed a small town occupied from 100-400AD. The Via Devana from Chester to Colchester, a military road, passed through this town. Another road led east from Wixoe, on the north side of the Stour, passing through Long Melford, before heading north-east to Baylham and possibly to Dunwich on the coast; this route is associated with a prehistoric road. No clear trace of this road can now be seen between Wixoe and Cavendish: the agger in the form of terrace has either been eroded by ploughing or incorporated into field boundaries, as is typical in East Anglia.

=== Norman ===
The name first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &#x27;Clara&#x27;. It possibly derives from the &quot;clear&quot; nature of the Chilton Stream as it flows through the town, but from a Latin word rather than a Celtic one as was previously thought. In the Domesday Book, it is described as &quot;Always a market. Now 43 burgesses&quot;. Hatton describes this as an &quot;astonishingly high number, because at the time very few Suffolk towns had any burgesses, let alone 43&quot;. It lists of meadow, woodland for 12 swine, a mill, 5 arpents of vineyard (an arpent was 4–6 acres) and 400 sheep. The manor included Stoke-by-Clare and the hamlet of Chilton Street, totalling 128 households. Improbably it has been suggested that the word claret is derived from Clare and its extensive vineyards. There is a Claret Hall towards Ashen, but that could simply mean &#x27;Little Clare&#x27;.

=== The feudal lords of Clare ===
The Domesday Book records that the lands around Clare belonged to a Saxon thane, Aluric (or Aelfric), son of Wisgar (or Withgar) and that he gave them to St John, probably creating in Clare a collegiate church, under Edward the Confessor. William the Conqueror re-granted the land to one of his closest supporters in the Norman Conquest of 1066, Richard fitz Gilbert of Bienfaite, Count of Brionne, the son of one of his cousins, along with 170 other manors, 95 of them in Suffolk. This huge feudal barony became known as the Honour of Clare. Richard became known as &quot;Richard de Clare&quot; (or &quot;of Clare&quot;) after he made the castle of Clare the caput of his feudal barony, that is to say his administrative centre. He also held a large manor in Tonbridge, Kent where he built a motte and bailey castle of a very similar size to Clare Castle. Clare Castle is first recorded in 1090.

His son Gilbert de Clare gave the church in the castle to the Benedictine Bec Abbey in Normandy. Gilbert and his brother were present with Prince Henry when King William II was shot dead by an arrow fired by Walter Tyrell, Gilbert&#x27;s steward. Tradition is strong that the Clares had staged an assassination. King Henry I was crowned three days later.

In 1124 Gilbert&#x27;s son Richard de Clare removed the Benedictines to a new foundation in Stoke-by-Clare, the origin of today&#x27;s Stoke College.

In 1140 Richard&#x27;s son Gilbert de Clare was given the title of Earl of Hertford by King Stephen. He joined the revolt against the king but later returned to support him.

Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford and his son Gilbert were two of the 25 barons appointed as guardians to Magna Carta of 1215. Richard married the heiress of the Earl of Gloucester, whose sister had been the first wife of King John.

Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford inherited the title and vast estates of the Earl of Gloucester. It was his son, Richard who brought the Augustinian Friars to Clare to found the mother house in England in 1248.

The wealthiest of the Clare family was Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester (&#x27;the Red&#x27;). He sided with Simon de Montfort and attended Montfort&#x27;s Parliament, but then fell out with Montfort and fought alongside Prince Edward at the Battle of Evesham, when Montfort was killed. He seized London and held it against King Henry III. After King Edward I&#x27;s accession, he married Joan of Acre in 1290, the king&#x27;s daughter. He surrendered his lands to the king and was re-granted them. He held land in 26 English counties and also estates in Wales, including Caerphilly, Usk and Tintern. This era represented the high point of the family as a major force in English history.

On his death in 1295, his wife Joan remarried one of his household knights and began new works at Clare Priory. She was buried in the Chapel of St Vincent which she herself had founded in 1307. The funeral was one of the major public events in Clare&#x27;s history, attended by royalty and nobility, including her brother King Edward II. Hatton wrote: &quot;Fifty-two years after her burial the grave was opened and her body found to be incorrupt...Of the many miracles wrought by God&#x27;s grace through her (were) especially...the cure of toothache, back-ache and fever&quot;.

Her son Gilbert was the last male de Clare. At the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, he was accused of cowardice and treason when he recommended holding the better ground rather than attacking Bruce&#x27;s densely packed pike walls. Against his better judgement he led the charge and was killed. One of Gilbert&#x27;s sisters, Elizabeth de Burgh eventually came into the property of Clare, and she endowed what would become Clare College, Cambridge.

William de Burgh was Elizabeth&#x27;s son by her first husband, John de Burgh, next in line to the Earldom of Ulster. He was assassinated in Carrickfergus in 1333 by his Irish cousins. His daughter Elizabeth was married to the third son of Edward III. Her husband Lionel thereby came into the Clare inheritance and became the Duke of Clarence. Chaucer the poet was at one time a page to him. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1360, he married the Count of Milan&#x27;s daughter. There were wild rumours he was about to become King of Italy, but he died near Pavia a few months after his marriage. Following his last wish, his heart and bones were brought back to Clare for burial beside his first wife.

The title of Clarenceux King of Arms, an heraldic officer, is also derived from Clare or Clarence.

The estate passed into the hands of the Mortimers, the Earls of March. The castle began to fall into disrepair from this time. The last descendant was Edward V, one of the two Princes in the Tower. Henry VII took over Clare borough and manor. Henry VIII gave them to each of his wives in turn, Katherine of Aragon leasing the common to the poor of Clare. Under Queen Mary, the lands of the Honour of Clare were transferred to the Duchy of Cornwall (which is why today William, Prince of Wales will technically appoint the Vicar). The title of Duke of Clarence was last held by Albert Victor, the eldest son of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and Alexandra, Princess of Wales (later Queen Alexandra), and the grandson of the reigning monarch, Queen Victoria. From the time of his birth, he was second in the line of succession to the throne, but he did not become king because he died before his father and his grandmother, the Queen. He had agreed to be the patron of the Royal Clarence Lodge of the Freemasons in Clare but died in 1892 before he could attend the opening ceremony.

=== Life in the Medieval Castle ===
At its height in Elizabeth de Burgh&#x27;s time the castle offered substantial employment, perhaps 250 persons not counted amongst the townspeople. The manor&#x27;s home farm provided the bulk of basic foodstuffs from the pastures and meadows plus fruit from the orchards of pear, apple and cherry. Within the castle grounds, there were fishponds, a horse driven mill, woodyard, a vineyard, kennels, a dovecote and a swannery. There were forges, both for weaponry and farming implements. She had her own potters, carpenters, goldsmiths and embroidery studio. She hired copiers to create masterpieces on vellum. Above all there were the brewhouses and bakeries producing great quantities of ale and bread. In one year the accounts show wheat for 106,248 loaves and malt for 40,682 gallons of ale.

The castle had one principal gateway, a substantial buildings in its own right, now gone – only the name Nethergate or &quot;Bottom Gate&quot; survives. There were several towers aside from the keep; we know their names: Auditor&#x27;s, Constable&#x27;, Oxenford and Maiden&#x27;s, but not their locations. Beautiful gardens were laid out. There were flint paths, seats, a glass aviary, fountains, a deer enclosure and a lion house (keeping exotic animals was the fashion). After her death in 1360, the castle became increasingly unused. It passed through her granddaughter (also Elizabeth) to Lionel of Antwerp, son of Edward III, and through their daughter by marriage to the Mortimers. By the 1480s it had been largely abandoned. In the C17, it is described as &#x27;nothing but lamentable ruins upon a most beautiful situation&#x27;.

=== The Black Death ===
Early in 1349 the plague reached East Anglia. &#x27;In the Manorial Court Rolls for March...there are very long lists of the death of tenants.&#x27;. The rolls cease in September and do not resume until 1360. Yet the Court Rolls of the Borough do not show the same pattern: court leets continue as before, the number of brewers, bakers, butchers and others accused of sharp practices remains constant. The Wentford fair was held as normal. Elizabeth de Burgh&#x27;s castle records have no mention of the plague nor show any fall in the day-to-day activities. Everything suggests the town was little affected.

=== Guilds ===
Local people organised themselves into guilds, not for mercantile or craft purposes, but as religious fraternities, dedicated to assisting the poor, praying for dead members, contributing to the church and priory. We know of five in Clare: St Augustine, St Peter, St Mary, Corpus Christi and St John the Baptist, the latter based on Chilton Street. Guilds began before the Normans; one of the oldest recorded was in Glemsford, the Fraternity of the Clerks, founded around 1020. The name Corpus Christi dates from the 1340s when that feast day was introduced from the continent; it soon became the most popular holy day in the calendar – see the mystery plays of Norwich and Ely, and all across England. The eponymous college in Cambridge was founded by a guild, in response to the decimation of the Black Death. This event seems to have concentrated people&#x27;s minds on their heavenly prospects. By prayer and acts of charity (carried out in the guild&#x27;s name rather than personally), a guild member hoped to ensure a swifter passage for himself and his family through purgatory to heaven.

By the time of Henry VIII, most areas of England had as many as 50 public holidays (holy days) a year on which no one worked. The guild whose feast day it was would hold a solemn procession and celebrate mass in the church. They would then provide entertainment such as mummers or miracle plays and food for the poor of their community. The Guild of St John put out casks of ale: &quot;&quot;.

There was a guildhall in the town, opposite the church, probably shared by different guilds. Elsewhere, as in Lavenham, each guild had its own building, but Clare seems less well endowed. The C14 building still stands, now a doctor&#x27;s surgery; fine old beams may be seen in the waiting room.

As elsewhere there are scanty records as all religious guilds were suppressed under an Act of Parliament in 1547 and their properties and assets seized. This Act also forbade the worship and representation of saints and masses for the dead. Public holidays (holy days) on which a guild would provide food for the poor and entertainment such as mummers or miracle plays all stopped at the same time, along with feast day markets. The annual market at Wentford, a noted regional event held on the Feast of Nativity of the Virgin Mary (8 September) disappeared. This suppression and its effect on the social and religious life is described as the Stripping of the Altars.

=== Wool Town ===
During the medieval period Clare became a prosperous town based on cloth making. The trade was already present by the 13th century, steadily expanding as demand grew. 3000 local fleeces were sold from Clare Manor alone in 1345. By the 1470s Suffolk produced more cloth than any other county. Broadcloth was the main product, somewhat coarser than Harris Tweed, prickly to the skin, odorous when wet. Flowing water was essential for the purpose of fulling – so production concentrated on locations along rivers such as Clare, Cavendish, Glemsford and Sudbury. Many houses in Clare had cellars through which culverts were led.

Merchants gathered in convoys for safety to convey the goods to Calais (then an English possession). Several locations in Suffolk were known as collection points – one of these is Callis Street in Clare, just north of the parish church, variously named Calais or Chalyce Street.

Clothiers organised and financed the industry, putting out work across the town, supporting road maintenance, providing alms to the poor, embellishing the priory and church, building substantial houses for themselves.

At the same time as the major disruption to the social and religious life of the townspeople took place in the 1540s, the introduction of the spinning wheel and the importation of newer fabrics from the continent led to a fall in the manufacture of broadcloth. Clare recovered some of its industry in the late 16th century, by taking up what is called the &#x27;New Draperies&#x27;, lighter and cheaper cloths called &#x27;bays and says&#x27;. &#x27;A bay was lighter and finer than modern baize... A say was a fine durable cloth, made entirely of wool with a texture resembling serge&#x27;. By the 18th century this industry was in decline, becoming concentrated in the larger towns, Ipswich and Colchester. At the close of the 16th century, Sir Robert Jermyn described Clare as &#x27;... a populous market town [which] requires an able, painful and discreet teacher ...&#x27; in a letter to Robert Cecil requesting the appointment of a &#x27;Mr Colte&#x27; as the town&#x27;s new pastor.

=== Into the modern age ===

From the relative boom of the 16th century, Clare suffered a gradual decline as a leading town in West Suffolk. For a while in the 17th century, it retained some status as a transport and distribution hub, lying on a major highway into London. Hostelries were set up and warehouses occupied a key role in the economy. Trade was diverted as the Stour became navigable as far as Sudbury in 1709. The handloom weaving industry was gone by the 1800s; the last weaver died in 1825, aged 83. Straw-plaiting for ladies&#x27; bonnets, a local cottage industry, disappeared as fashions changed.

After an agricultural boom in the Napoleonic wars, farmers were hit by falling prices; many labourers were laid off. Opposition to newer technology appeared in Clare and surrounding districts in 1816 and four local men were gaoled after being convicted of burning a threshing machine. This was the Year Without a Summer caused by volcanic dust in the atmosphere: the local press reported floods, &#x27;long continued wet weather&#x27;, unripened wheat and widespread civil unrest. Harvests were again terrible in 1828 and 1829, followed by the Swing Riots. The Long Depression (1870–1895) caused many families to move away from the town.

=== Historic travel writing ===
William Camden in his &quot;Britain, or, a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot; (1610) wrote: &#x27;On the South side wee saw the river Stour, which immediately from the verie spring head spreadeth a great Mere called Stourmmere, but soone after, drawing it selfe within the bankes, runneth first by Clare, a noble village which had a castle, but now , and gave name to the right noble familie of the Clares&#x27;.

Daniel Defoe in &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot; (1748 4th edition) said that Clare was &quot;a poor town and dirty, the streets being unpaved. But yet the civil and spiritual courts are held at it and it has a good church; it shows still the ruins of a strong castle, and an old monastery. It has a manufacture of says…&quot;. He also describes great droves of turkeys being taken to Colchester from Clare, 300 to 1,000 birds at a time.

=== Managing a Masterpiece ===
As part of the Heritage Lottery Funded &quot;Managing a Masterpiece&quot; scheme, in April and May 2011 Access Cambridge Archaeology gave residents, school pupils and members of the public the chance to carry out their own small archaeological &#x27;test pit&#x27; excavations throughout Clare, to find out how the town developed over hundreds – even thousands – of years in the past. Early results indicated the presence of Saxon pottery across many sites – the first evidence of Clare&#x27;s importance before the Normans. Further excavations within the castle grounds took place in 2013 and the discovery of human remains suggested a cemetery was located there, before the castle&#x27;s construction.

== Architecture ==

There are 133 listed buildings in Clare. An online map is available, with links to each building. Over 40 of the listed buildings are 16th-century or earlier. There are three Grade 1 religious buildings: the Priory, the Priory Chapel and the parish church of Ss Peter and Paul. There are three Grade 1 domestic houses: Cliftons and Nethergate House in Nethergate Street and the Ancient House in Church Street. The Ancient House, which has florid pargeting, is in part a museum, in part available as a holiday-let through the Landmark Trust. A rare 13th-century flint-lined well has been found in the garden behind the No 1 Deli Cafe. There are fine examples of timber-framed houses throughout the town, from the 14th to the 16th centuries, plus Georgian and Victorian houses. Most of the later houses are constructed in Flemish bond, but there is one example of a rat trap bond in Station Road. Some of the weavers&#x27; cottages had cellars through which water ran for fulling their cloth. The heart of the town is a conservation area, one of 35 recognised by St Edmundsbury Council. A full appraisal of buildings was carried out in 2008 within the conservation plan.

Suffolk has no natural building stone. Buildings are mainly of timber, usually oak beams with wattle and daub infill, or brick. Brickyards abounded in Suffolk. Clare had its own brickyard in the 19th century, run by the Jarvis family. Examples of brick from Gestingthorpe and Ballingdon can also be found, both Suffolk whites and reds. Flint is used as an infill or in walling. Where stone is found it was largely imported from Barnack, near Peterborough. This was transported along the Fenland waterways and brought into Suffolk, either overland from Cambridge or possibly by sail to Manningtree and then up the Stour.

The 13th-century flint-stone castle keep sits upon a high motte overlooking the town on the banks of the River Stour. Parts of the inner and outer baileys still exist. The castle is part of the Clare Castle Country Park which has the distinction of containing the only (now decommissioned) railway station built within a castle in the UK. The station was built by the Great Eastern Railway on the Stour Valley Railway and closed in 1967. The complex of stationmaster&#x27;s house, ticket and parcels office, waiting rooms, platforms and goods shed has been listed, as the only complete set of 1865 GER buildings to survive intact. The park has of landscaped parkland, interlaced with water in the old moats. The Stour Valley Path crosses the park.

Crossing the Stour en route to Ashen is a three span cast iron bridge, built when Clare was on a main highway between London and Bury St Edmunds. It was Sir William Cubitt&#x27;s second design for a bridge. The date of completion 1813 can be seen above the central arch. The iron was almost certainly cast at Ransomes of Ipswich, a foundry mostly known for agricultural machinery for whom Cubitt worked. Later they supplied the new railways across East Anglia. In good condition, the bridge is Suffolk&#x27;s oldest iron bridge still in use.

The tower of the wool church (St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s church, below) was a restoration project of the well known Arts &amp; Crafts architect Detmar Blow, who also designed an addition (and possibly other works) to Clare Priory. While in Clare, he lived in the Ancient House.

=== Churches ===
There are four churches in Clare today, ordered below by date of building.
* The Clare Priory Chapel – Mother of Good Counsel]. Just across the river is the first house of the Augustinian Friars in England, founded at the behest of Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester: Clare Priory, established in 1248. The friars were dependent on local people for their daily needs; they would have been familiar figures in the streets of Clare in their black habits as they ministered to the spiritual and welfare needs of their parishioners. The priory was suppressed in 1538. Many of the priory buildings, including the large church, fell into disrepair; just as happened to the derelict castle, the townspeople helped themselves to a source of materials. The property changed hands a number of times until it was re-acquired by the Augustinians in 1953. The former infirmary had become a barn and was restored to create a chapel for worship. The site remains in use today as both a parish and a retreat centre. A Craft Fair is held in July, attracting 10,000 visitors over two days, proceeds going to charity. The chapel has been extended to form a new church in contemporary style. This is winner of the &quot;Building Conservation&quot; category in the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors 2015 Awards; the completed work has been declared Project of the Year.
* St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Clare which is Anglican
* The United Reformed Church. In 1645 a group of non-conforming dissenters appointed their own minister. As numbers grew, licences were issued for houses as places of worship. A third of the East Anglian established clergy left to become presbyterian or independent. In 1710 a large meeting place was built behind Nethergate Street, replacing a smaller presbyterian conventicle. In 1841 this was rebuilt as the plain but attractive church it is today. An ancient graveyard adjoins the church.
* Clare Baptist Church. In 1801 some independents broke away and formed a baptist group. In 1802 twelve of them went to Halstead to be baptised as adults. In 1805 they built the first Baptist Church on Cavendish Street. This was rebuilt in 1821 to accommodate a bigger congregation. In 1859 this was demolished and the building material taken to the High Street to help create a new church which stands today.

In the past, Quakers were strong in the area and had their own building by 1686, a cottage at the north foot of the castle motte. The then owner of the castle and priory, Captain Charles Barnardiston was a Quaker. He and his fellows were prosecuted for his beliefs and &#x27;was debarred of the use of their meeting-house, and obliged to meet in the street during the cold winter, where they received much personal abuse&#x27;. What is left of the burial ground is now part of 3 Cavendish Road. The nearest Meeting Houses are now Bardfield, Bury St Edmunds and Sudbury.

The oldest religious building in Clare still existing is the Norman chapel of St Mary Magdalene, dated c1190. Built as a wayside chapel just ½ mile north of Clare, close to a confluence of the Chilton stream at Wentford, it fell into disrepair by 1403 but was later granted to the Guild of St John the Baptist in Chilton. At the time of the dissolution of guilds and chantry chapels in 1547, the priest worked in Clare parish church and also in the grammar school. It was converted for domestic use. In the Civil War it was used as a powder magazine. Grade II* listed as Chapel Cottage, today it is called Old Chapel; remains of Norman windows, a bellcote, timber framing and an arched doorway are visible.

Chipley Abbey, just to the west of Poslingford, is a Grade II listed farmhouse incorporating part of the cloisters and moat of Chipley Priory, an Augustinian Canons foundation created before 1235.

=== Public houses ===
There are four public houses in the town, all of them occupying historic buildings.
* The Swan in the High Street occupies the oldest premises: one owner died from the Black Death in 1349. The central chimney stack with four orthogonal shafts predates the main structure from around 1600. Above the main doorway is a carved solid block of oak – possibly the oldest inn sign in England. It seems to be the base of an oriel window taken from Clare Castle. The central figure is of a chained swan with a crown round the neck – the badge of Henry IV. Other symbols link it to Henry V, the Mortimers and de Burghs. A grape vine suggests a link with Clare&#x27;s fame as a wine-producing area.
* The Bell on Market Hill occupies a small alehouse site and was extensively altered to become the Green Dragon around 1580. In the 1780s it became a post house (providing changes of horses and gigs for hire) when the beautiful interior carved beams and ceilings were added. It was a wholesale trading house with brew house and bar. Early in the 19th century it specialised in chandlery – oil, ropes and candles were made on the premises. At the rear the cattle market was held till the mid-1850s. In the 1970s, 18th-century stables were converted to 23 hotel bedrooms.
* The Cock in Callis Street may date from the 15th century but the first reference to it as an inn is in 1636. In its time various parts of the current building were used as a barn, then as a schoolroom, later a family butcher&#x27;s with its own slaughterhouse. It was linked for a time with the Nethergate brewery, which was founded in Clare.
* The Globe, a few houses away from the Cock, dates from 1695, re-fronted in Suffolk white brick early in the 19th century – this was a common practice in those days, giving a building a new respectable front, while retaining the old timber frame behind. It probably opened as a pub in the 1880s.

Other public houses and hostelries existed in the past, all buildings still standing, except the last: the Old Red Lion 17th century, the Old Bear and Crown Hotel 16th century, the White Hart Inn 19th century (later the Temperance Hotel), the Half Moon 15th century, the Clare Hotel 19th century, the Castle 19th century, the Boar and Griffin 16th century, and the Old Angel.

On the High Street, where numbers 10 A and B now stand, the Nethergate Brewery was created in 1986. In 2004, it moved across the river to Pentlow. It has since moved to Rodbridge corner, on the outskirts of Sudbury.

== Shops ==
Clare has a large number of independent shops, many in Grade II listed buildings. These are clustered in the conservation area. With the exception of the Co-operative Food supermarket, there are no other chain stores in the town. Its historic market has been on Market Hill in modern form, and is held on the third Saturday of each month.

== Agriculture ==

The Suffolk Landscape Character Assessment, published by Suffolk County Council, available online, examines the characteristics of the landscape topology around Clare, which consists of valley meadowlands and undulating farmlands, both ancient and estate.

The majority of agriculture around Clare is arable. Crops grown include winter wheat, winter barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape and broad beans for fodder, with smaller areas of rye and oats. The sugar beet is taken to the British Sugar factory in Bury St Edmunds.

In the Tudor period, the area is described as: &quot;Wood-pasture region, mainly pasture, meadow, engaged in rearing and dairying with some bee-keeping, horse-breeding and poultry. Crops mainly barley with some wheat, rye, oats, peas, vetches, hops and occasionally hemp.&quot;

Because of the Stour there were mills in Clare, four reported in 1295. Malting Lane marks one, Mill Lane another. At least one mill was for fulling. The last corn mill, an 18th-century timber-framed structure together with a 19th-century brick boiler house and steam engine, known as Waymans Mill, was destroyed by fire in the late 1970s. Windmills also existed – there is a ruinous stack near Chilton Street.

The market that had run in Market Hill from before the Norman Conquest shrank after the arrival of the railway in 1865. Farmers preferred to take their produce to the larger markets of Ipswich, Sudbury or Cambridge. The Corn Exchange of 1838 eventually closed and was later replaced by Clare Town Hall.

There have been dramatic changes to farming and the agricultural landscape, particularly in the last century. Just north of Stoke-by-Clare is an example. Hull&#x27;s Farm of was divided into 67 fields, bounded by hedges and elm trees, with 30 farm workers and many horses. Pressure on farmers to increase food production during and after World War II, resulted in removal of a wood of , grubbed up to control the rabbit population, leaving of Lord&#x27;s Wood. Hedgerows were cut down. Dutch elm disease then decimated the tree population, leaving a wide open landscape. Now the farm buildings have been replaced by a nature reserve and the land incorporated into Stonard&#x27;s Farm, with five farm workers and four tractors. The crop trebled between 1955 and 1996.
== Local issues ==
;Country Park
:Ownership of Clare Castle Country Park passed from Suffolk County Council to Clare Town Council in March 2015. The park is managed by the Clare Castle Country Park Trust, with the help of volunteers. The rehabilitation of buildings is now complete; this includes restoration of the stationmaster&#x27;s house as a residence and of the principal waiting room.
;Library
:Suffolk County Council has created an independent service to run libraries in the future. A Friends of Clare Library group has been formed.
;HGV problems
:Clare lies on the A1092 road. There are two tight bends in the town and larger vehicles have difficulty in negotiating them; damage to buildings is a frequent occurrence. A campaign involving several communities along the A1092 is requesting a re-designation of the route.

== Town or village ==
At the time of the Domesday Book, while several towns in Suffolk had markets, Clare was one of only six towns that had burgesses as well. Its manor was among the largest in the county. The Lords of Clare established it as their administrative centre, the castle itself providing work for scores of people. It was known as a borough by 1262, but no charter survives and no parliamentary seat was established – unlike Sudbury. By 1294 a fair was established. From the 11th century through to the 16th century there was plenty of employment and prosperity; the wool cloth trade flourished, first making broadcloth, later making bay and say cloth. It became a key staging post on a main highway to London, with warehouses and hostelries. Trade declined when the Stour became navigable as far as Sudbury in 1709. Weaving ceased and the town became a small agricultural centre, trade shrinking further when the railway arrived. The Parish Council was created in 1894.

The population remained consistently below 2,000 across the ages. The number of houses increased from 152 (including Wixoe and Chilton Street) in 1674 to 852 in 1991, and 950 in 2015; living space standards increased dramatically in the last century. Unusually for a settlement of just over 2,000, it has a full range of services: bank, butcher, doctors, library, co-op, off-licence, ironmonger, five cafes, four public houses – three serving food – one a hotel, restaurants, take-aways (Chinese, fish and chips), four antique shops – one a large emporium, pharmacy, hairdressers, post office with news and stationery, vintage fashion boutique, four churches, physiotherapy, photographer, health food, alternative medicine, undertaker, art gallery, architect, gift shops, optician, florist, accountant, solicitor, beauty treatments, diet advice, farm food and pet supplies, sandwich shop, estate agents, bed and breakfasts, bookshop, stables, 2 auctions, printer, domestic help, Japanese knotweed treatment, advertising, car bodywork, car repairs, architectural ironmongery, taxi, 9-hole golf course, garden bulbs, jam maker, fisheries, website design, many trades, ... farms, pedigree sheep and the Nuttery, a community woodland, winner of the Best Conservation Project in the Anglia in Bloom competition 2011.

In modern terms, Clare is a large village, hence its award as &quot;Suffolk Village of the Year 2010&quot;, but the people still like to think of themselves as living in West Suffolk&#x27;s smallest town. In April 2012, the parish council renamed itself as a Town Council.

== Notable people ==

<doc id="827377" wikidata="Q158932" url="?curid=827377" title="Edguy">
<text>Edguy is a German power metal band formed in 1992 in Fulda by students Tobias Sammet, Jens Ludwig, Dominik Storch, and Dirk Sauer. Initially named after their math teacher, the band faced early rejections from record labels but persevered, releasing their unofficial debut album, &quot;Savage Poetry&quot;, in 1995. They gained wider recognition with their subsequent albums, including &quot;Kingdom of Madness&quot; (1997) and &quot;Vain Glory Opera&quot; (1998), featuring guest appearances from notable musicians. Over the years, Edguy has evolved their sound, with Sammet also launching the successful metal opera project Avantasia. The band has released multiple studio albums, including &quot;Age of the Joker&quot; (2011) and &quot;Space Police: Defenders of the Crown&quot; (2014), and has engaged in extensive touring. As of March 2020, Edguy is on hiatus while Sammet focuses on new Avantasia material.

== History ==
=== Demos, AFM years (1992–2003) ===
Edguy was founded in 1992 by 14-year-old students Tobias Sammet, Jens Ludwig, Dominik Storch, and Dirk Sauer. The name &quot;Edguy&quot; was an affectionate epithet for their math teacher at the time. In 1994, the band released two demos, &quot;Evil Minded&quot; and &quot;Children of Steel&quot;. These tapes were sent to many record labels, all of whom rejected the band, believing they would be unsuccessful in the music business.

Undeterred, they self-released their &quot;unofficial&quot; debut album, &quot;Savage Poetry&quot;, in 1995. Shortly thereafter, they signed with AFM Records, which offered to re-release &quot;Savage Poetry&quot; with more widespread distribution. The band, however, rejected this proposal in favor of recording a new album, &quot;Kingdom of Madness&quot;, which was released in 1997, although drummer Dominik Storch departed shortly after. In 1998, they released their second album, &quot;Vain Glory Opera&quot;, with friend Frank Lindenthal filling in on drums. This album helped expose Edguy to a broader audience, partly due to guest appearances from Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius) and Hansi Kürsch (Blind Guardian). The band was later joined by new drummer Felix Bohnke and bassist Tobias &#x27;Eggi&#x27; Exxel, allowing Tobias Sammet to focus solely on vocals (he had previously played bass while also handling vocal duties).

In 1999, &quot;Theater of Salvation&quot; was released. That same year, frontman Tobias Sammet conceived the idea for the Avantasia project, a metal opera featuring well-known vocalists and musicians from the rock and metal scene. While Tobias focused on Avantasia, the band took the opportunity to re-record &quot;Savage Poetry&quot; to make it widely available to newer fans, as the original had become a much sought-after rarity.

Following the re-recording of &quot;Savage Poetry&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Mandrake&quot;, was released in 2001. The album was accompanied by their first promo video for the track &quot;All the Clowns&quot; and the Painting on the Wall single. The &quot;Mandrake&quot; album also led to the band&#x27;s first headlining tour. Three shows were recorded in Europe and served as the basis for Edguy&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Burning Down the Opera – Live&quot;.

By this point, the band&#x27;s contract with AFM had expired, leading them to sign with Nuclear Blast in late 2003.

=== Nuclear Blast years (2004–present) ===
Edguy&#x27;s inaugural release with Nuclear Blast was the &quot;King of Fools&quot; EP in 2004, followed closely by the &quot;Hellfire Club&quot; album, which was released shortly thereafter. The track &quot;Lavatory Love Machine&quot; was also issued as a single. The band&#x27;s prolific output continued into 2005 with the release of the &quot;Superheroes&quot; EP and accompanying DVD, the latter featuring live and studio footage of the band, as well as a making-of documentary for the title track&#x27;s music video. This was succeeded by the full-length album &quot;Rocket Ride&quot;, which was released in January 2006.

In 2007, Sammet dedicated much of his time to relaunching the Avantasia project. Edguy returned to the studio in 2008 to record &quot;Tinnitus Sanctus&quot;, with a video being filmed for the track &quot;Ministry of Saints&quot; in Belgrade, Serbia. Following a contract renewal with Nuclear Blast in late 2008, the band released their first live DVD, &quot;Fucking with Fire – Live&quot;, in 2009. This DVD featured live performances captured in São Paulo, Brazil, during their Rocket Ride world tour in 2006. In 2010, the band supported Scorpions on the German dates of their farewell tour.

Edguy released their ninth studio album, &quot;Age of the Joker&quot;, in August 2011. The band subsequently toured Europe and South America in support of the album, including dates with Slash and Deep Purple, as well as an appearance on the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise.

On 13 February 2013, Sammet conducted an interview to promote the latest release from his Avantasia project. During the interview, he revealed that Edguy was planning to release a new album in mid-2014. On 28 January 2014, Edguy announced that the album would be titled &quot;Space Police: Defenders of the Crown&quot; and would be released on 18 April.

On 13 March 2017, a 2-CD/DVD package titled &quot;Monuments&quot; was announced for release on 14 July, featuring both old and new material.

In 2018, Edguy released a remastered edition of their debut album &quot;Kingdom of Madness&quot; as an Anniversary Edition.

In March 2020, Sammet announced via Facebook that Edguy was on hiatus because he had &quot;been working on a new Avantasia record for a while now, and not on a new Edguy record because that&#x27;s what feels right to me.&quot; Sammet also explained that while he considered &quot;Space Police&quot; to be a great album, the production process had been &quot;exhausting.&quot;

== Musical style == 
Edguy&#x27;s lyrics often feature metaphorical references, addressing metaphysical or social themes such as conformity (&quot;The Headless Game,&quot; &quot;Mysteria,&quot; &quot;King of Fools&quot;), the influence of the church (&quot;The Kingdom,&quot; &quot;The Pride of Creation,&quot; &quot;Theater of Salvation&quot;), and the dangers posed by modern civilization (&quot;Navigator,&quot; &quot;The Devil and the Savant&quot;). To convey these themes, Edguy sometimes employs esoteric and hermetic expressions. However, some of their songs take a light-hearted or comedic approach, such as &quot;Das Reh,&quot; &quot;Save Us Now,&quot; &quot;Lavatory Love Machine,&quot; &quot;Life and Times of a Bonus Track,&quot; and &quot;Trinidad.&quot; Edguy does not purport to represent any specific ideology; Tobias Sammet has stated, &quot;[the band is] not political and we are not religious; at least there is no key message in our songs telling you what to think in terms of anything.&quot;

The album &quot;Hellfire Club&quot; showcased Edguy&#x27;s interest in musical experimentation by incorporating an orchestra into its production. This album presented a variation on Edguy&#x27;s typical style, embracing a less grandiose, more progressive metal approach. Their subsequent album, &quot;Rocket Ride&quot;, contains even fewer power metal elements and leans more towards hard rock. The next release, &quot;Tinnitus Sanctus&quot;, features an even greater focus on hard rock-oriented songs; a notable reduction in double bass drumming is evident, contrasting sharply with Edguy&#x27;s earlier albums, such as &quot;Vain Glory Opera&quot;, which prominently featured rapid double bass—a hallmark of the power metal genre. When asked whether the term &quot;happy heavy metal band&quot; applies to them, Tobias rejected the label and elaborated:

<doc id="827385" wikidata="Q5406088" url="?curid=827385" title="Euclid (programming language)">
<text>Euclid is an imperative programming language for writing verifiable programs. It was designed in the mid-1970s by Butler Lampson and James G. Mitchell at the Xerox PARC lab in collaboration with Jim Horning at the University of Toronto, Ralph L. London at USC ISI and Gerald J. Popek at UCLA. The implementation was led by Ric Holt at the University of Toronto and James Cordy was the principal programmer for the first implementation of the compiler. It was originally designed for the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. It was considered innovative for the time; the compiler development team had a $2 million budget over 2 years and was commissioned by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Canadian Department of National Defence. It was used for a few years at I. P. Sharp Associates, MITRE Corporation, SRI International and various other international institutes for research in systems programming and secure software systems.

Euclid is descended from Pascal, Mesa, Alphard, CLU, Gypsy, BCPL, Modula, LIS, and SUE. Functions in Euclid are closed scopes, may not have side effects, and must explicitly declare imports. Euclid also disallows gotos, floating point numbers, global assignments, nested functions and aliases, and none of the actual parameters to a function can refer to the same memory cell (which Euclid calls a &quot;variable&quot;). Euclid implements modules as types. Descendants of Euclid include the Concurrent Euclid programming language and the Turing programming language.

<text>Secular education is a system of public education in countries with a secular government or separation between religion and state.

==History==

Secular educational systems were a modern development intended to replace religious ecclesiastical and rabbinic schools (like the heder) in Western Europe. Secular schools were to function as a cultural foundation to diffuse the values of a human culture that was a product of man&#x27;s own faculty for reason. 

This contrasted against religious education which placed value on tradition - knowledge that was &quot;revealed&quot; - instead of the &quot;human values through which manifested the uniqueness of the human being in nature as a creature who is himself a creator, a being who shapes his environment and who fashions himself within that environment&quot;. For Jews the ideal was the &quot;Maskil&quot;, the Jewish equivalent of Enlightenment philosophers or humanists.

==Actions and controversies==

===Banning of religious symbols===

In the French public educational system conspicuous religious symbols have been banned in schools. 

While some religious groups are hostile to secularism and see such measures as promoting atheism, other citizens claim that the display of any religious symbol constitutes an infringement of the separation of church and state and a discrimination against atheist, agnostic and non-religious people.

===Other===

*In Turkey the promotion of Imam Hatip Islamic schools by the government following the March 2012 education reform bill, allegedly alarmed some Turkish citizens. The Education Reform Bill was written without public debate or even discussion in the Ministry of National Education&#x27;s own consultative body; it did not even figure in the government’s 2011 election manifesto. Besides undermining Turkish secularism, the new measures would undermine educational standards and deepen social inequalities, according to education specialists. Turkey’s leading universities, including Sabancı University, Boğaziçi University, Middle East Technical University and Koç University, all issued press statements describing the reforms of 2012 as hastily conceived, retrograde and out of step with current thinking.
*In Italy the Lautsi v. Italy case was brought before the European Court of Human Rights regarding the display of crucifixes in classrooms of state schools. 
*In Romania the CNCD Decision 323/2006 was brought to the CNCD by Emil Moise, a teacher and parent from Buzău County, regarding the public display of Orthodox icons in classrooms and was supported by some high-profile activists. 
*In 2009 a new body was formed, the &quot;Australian Secular Lobby&quot;, to promote secular education in Australia.
*In Southern Thailand, the secular educational system is being undermined by insurgent groups by means of the destruction of schools and the assassination of teachers.

<doc id="827406" wikidata="Q5287629" url="?curid=827406" title="Document layout analysis">
<text>In computer vision or natural language processing, document layout analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing the regions of interest in the scanned image of a text document. A reading system requires the segmentation of text zones from non-textual ones and the arrangement in their correct reading order. Detection and labeling of the different zones (or blocks) as text body, illustrations, math symbols, and tables embedded in a document is called geometric layout analysis. But text zones play different logical roles inside the document (titles, captions, footnotes, etc.) and this kind of semantic labeling is the scope of the logical layout analysis.

Document layout analysis is the union of geometric and logical labeling. It is typically performed before a document image is sent to an OCR engine, but it can be used also to detect duplicate copies of the same document in large archives, or to index documents by their structure or pictorial content.

Document layout is formally defined in the international standard ISO 8613-1:1989.

== Overview of methods ==
There are two main approaches to document layout analysis. Firstly, there are bottom-up approaches which iteratively parse a document based on the raw pixel data. These approaches typically first parse a document into connected regions of black and white, then these regions are grouped into words, then into text lines, and finally into text blocks. Secondly, there are top-down approaches which attempt to iteratively cut up a document into columns and blocks based on white space and geometric information.

The bottom-up approaches are the traditional ones, and they have the advantage that they require no assumptions on the overall structure of the document. On the other hand, bottom-up approaches require iterative segmentation and clustering, which can be time consuming. Top-down approaches have the advantage that they parse the global structure of a document directly, thus eliminating the need to iteratively cluster together the possibly hundreds or even thousands of characters/symbols which appear on a document. They tend to be faster, but in order for them to operate robustly they typically require a number of assumptions to be made about on the layout of the document. Examples of top-down approaches include the recursive X-Y cut algorithm, which decomposes the document in rectangular sections.

There are two issues common to any approach at document layout analysis: noise and skew. Noise refers to image noise, such as salt and pepper noise or Gaussian noise. Skew refers to the fact that a document image may be rotated in a way so that the text lines are not perfectly horizontal. It is a common assumption in both document layout analysis algorithms and optical character recognition algorithms that the characters in the document image are oriented so that text lines are horizontal. Therefore, if there is skew present then it is important to rotate the document image so as to remove it.

It follows that the first steps in any document layout analysis code are to remove image noise and to come up with an estimate for the skew angle of the document.

== Example of a bottom up approach ==

In this section we will walk through the steps of a bottom-up document layout analysis algorithm developed in 1993 by O`Gorman. The steps in this approach are as follows:

# Preprocess the image to remove Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise. Note that some noise removal filters may consider commas and periods as noise, so some care must be taken.
# Convert the image into a binary image, i.e. convert each pixel value to completely white or completely black.
# Segment the image into connected components of black pixels. These are the symbols of the image. For each symbol, compute a bounding box and centroid.
# For each symbol, determine its k nearest neighbors where k is an integer greater than or equal to four. O`Gorman suggests k=5 in his paper as a good compromise between robustness and speed. The reason to use at least k=4 is that for a symbol in a document, the two or three nearest symbols are the ones right next to it on the same text line. The fourth-nearest symbol is typically on a line right above or below, and it is important to include these symbols in the nearest neighbor calculation for the following.
# Each nearest neighbor pair of symbols is related by a vector pointing from one symbol’s centroid to the other symbol’s centroid. If these vectors are plotted for every pair of nearest neighbor symbols, then one gets what is called the docstrum for the document (See figure below). One can also use the angle Θ from the horizontal and distance D between two nearest neighbor symbols and create a nearest-neighbor angle and nearest-neighbor distance histogram.
# Using the nearest-neighbor angle histogram, the skew of the document can be calculated. If the skew is acceptably low, continue to the next step. If it is not, rotate the image so as to remove the skew and return to step 3.
# The nearest-neighbor distance histogram has several peaks, and these peaks typically represent between-character spacing, between-word spacing, and between-line spacing. Calculate these values from the histogram and set them aside.
# For each symbol, look at its nearest neighbors and flag any of them that are a distance away which is within some tolerance of the between-character spacing distance or between-word spacing distance. For each nearest neighbor symbol which is flagged, draw a line segment connecting their centroids.
# Symbols connected to their neighbors by line segments form text lines. Using all the centroids in a text line, one can compute an actual line segment representing the text line with linear regression. This is important because it is unlikely that all the centroids of symbols in a text line are actually collinear.
# For each pair of text lines, one can compute a minimum distance between their corresponding line segments. If this distance is within some tolerance of the between-line spacing calculated in step 7, then the two text lines are grouped into the same text block.
# Finally, one can calculate a bounding box for each text block, and the document layout analysis is complete.

<text>Rex William Stewart Jr. (February 22, 1907 – September 7, 1967) was an American jazz cornetist who was a member of the Duke Ellington orchestra.

==Career==
As a boy he studied piano and violin; most of his career was spent on cornet. Stewart dropped out of high school to become a member of the Ragtime Clowns led by Ollie Blackwell. He was with the Musical Spillers led by Willie Lewis in the early 1920s, then with Elmer Snowden, Horace Henderson, Fletcher Henderson, Fess Williams, and McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers. In 1933 he led a big band at the Empire Ballroom in New York City. Beginning in 1934, he spent eleven years with the Duke Ellington band. Stewart co-wrote &quot;Boy Meets Horn&quot; and &quot;Morning Glory&quot; and supervised recording sessions by members of the Ellington band. He left Ellington to lead &quot;little swing bands that were a perfect setting for his solo playing.&quot; He toured in Europe and Australia with Jazz at the Philharmonic from 1947 to 1951. 

Beginning in the early 1950s, he worked in radio and television and wrote jazz criticism for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the magazines &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;DownBeat&quot;. The book &quot;Jazz Masters of the Thirties&quot; is a selection of his criticism. He lived in upstate New York after purchasing a one hundred year old farmhouse. He hosted a jazz radio program in Troy, New York, and owned a small restaurant for a short time near a drag racing track in Vermont. While living in France, he attended the Le Cordon Bleu school of cooking and dedicated his life to becoming a fine cook. Stewart moved to Los Angeles, California, to be near his children. His son Paul Albert Hardy lived in New York City. While in Los Angeles he reunited with musicians from the Ellington band and played jam sessions in clubs. He was a studio musician for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; and with George Cole he hosted two radio shows: &quot;Dixieland Doings&quot; and &quot;Things Aint What They Used to Be&quot;.

His autobiography, &quot;Boy Meets Horn&quot;, was published in 1991. He died of a brain hemorrhage in Los Angeles.

==Film and TV==
He made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Rendezvous in July&quot; (1949) directed by Jacques Becker. He also appeared in &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; (1957) telecast.

<doc id="827435" wikidata="Q37493" url="?curid=827435" title="Falls of Clyde (waterfalls)">
<text>The Falls of Clyde are a series of linns or waterfalls on the River Clyde, near Lanark, Scotland. They are renowned for their beauty and have frequently been painted by artists. There are four in total: Bonnington Linn, Corra Linn, and Dundaff Linn, all above Lanark, and Stonebyres Linn, some distance below the town. The highest and most impressive of the four is Corra Linn, with a fall of .

== History ==
The area has long been a popular destination for visitors. The Wordsworths, Coleridge and Sir Walter Scott all visited the Falls. In 1802, William Wordsworth immortalised Corra Linn, the largest of the waterfalls, in verse. Corra Linn has also been painted by a number of artists, including J. M. W. Turner. The name comes from the Gaelic &quot;currach&quot;, a marshy place. A legend gives &quot;Cora&quot; as a daughter of King Malcolm II, who leapt to her death here whilst trying to escape imagined danger.

Near Corra Linn is the Pavilion, built by Sir John Carmichael of Bonnington, probably in 1708. The Pavilion had mirrors on its back wall, and when the doors were opened visitors had the illusion of standing beneath the falls. The 15th-century Corra Castle is next to Corra Linn. It is now home to a good number of Daubenton&#x27;s bat and of some Natterer&#x27;s and whiskered bats. Corra is Gaelic for &quot;weir&quot;, and as Corra Castle&#x27;s early history is vague, some historians believe it was an early possession of the Weirs, the principal landowning family in the county after the Dukes of Hamilton from the 13th to 19th centuries. Corehouse, built in 1844, the home of the Cranstoun family, is nearby.

== Falls of Clyde Site of Special Scientific Interest ==

The Falls of Clyde Site of Special Scientific Interest (formerly the Corehouse Nature Reserve), a part of the Clyde Valley Woodlands National Nature Reserve, is an area of mixed woodland, including semi-natural native oakwoods and some areas of conifer plantation. It provides suitable habitat for badgers, roe deer, and over 100 species of bird. The site is well known for its resident breeding pair of peregrine falcons, which are protected during the breeding season by Operation Peregrine, providing security for the birds and a chance for the public to view the birds through scopes and CCTV. On 22 October 2011 at 1500 GMT a very rare pine marten was spotted within the reserve and was photographed. Within the reserve the Clyde River is suitable habitat for otters and kingfishers as well as the protected brook lamprey.

The Falls of Clyde Visitor Centre, operated by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, features exhibits about the waterfalls, the woodland and the area animals, including a special bat display.

== Hydro-electric power ==

The Lanark Hydro Electric Scheme is situated between Corra Linn and Dundaff Linn, with a water inlet at Bonnington Linn, and is considered the oldest of the United Kingdom.

The scheme was conceived in 1925 under the chairmanship of Sir Edward MacColl and was completed in 1927 as the first hydro-electric power station in Scotland designed for public supply, rather than industry. The power station at Stonebyres was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer (who also acted as design advisor to the committee looking at the overall concept).

The plant generates approximately eleven megawatts of power. Another hydro-electric power station is situated near Stonebyres Linn, about three miles south of Corra Linn. This generates approximately six megawatts of power. Both stations are owned and operated by Scottish Power.

<text>The Frankston line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s third-longest metropolitan railway line, at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Frankston station in the south-east, serving 28 stations via South Yarra, Caulfield, Moorabbin, and Mordialloc. The line continues to Stony Point on the non-electrified Stony Point line. The line operates for approximately 20 hours a day (from approximately 4:00 am to around 11:30 pm) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 5 to 10 minutes are operated with services every 10–20 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Frankston line run with a two three-car formations of Comeng, Siemens Nexas, and X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Sections of the Frankston line opened as early as 1881, with the line fully extended to Frankston in 1882. A limited number of stations were first opened, with infill stations progressively opened between 1881 and 2017. The line was built to connect Melbourne with the rural towns of Caulfield, Moorabbin, and Frankston, amongst others. Significant growth has occurred since opening, with a plan to extend the Frankston line along part of the Stony Point line to Baxter.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Frankston line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. Different packages of works have upgraded the corridor to replace sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, the introduction of new rolling stock, and the removal of all level crossings.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===

In 1881, the Frankston line began operations by the Victorian Railways on a single tracked line from Caulfield to Mordialloc. Mordialloc station was officially opened on 19 December 1881 by Sir Thomas Bent, who was the Minister of Railways, and later becoming the Premier of Victoria between 1904 and 1909. The first train to arrive at Mordialloc was a special service from Princes Bridge, which collected school children from the Brighton area. Further specials occurred during the day, with proper timetabled services commencing the following day. Six services were provided upon opening and, apart from two services, all were shuttle services operating between Caulfield and Mordialloc.

In August 1882, operations were extended from Mordialloc to Frankston. The section of track from Caulfield to Mordialloc was duplicated in 1888. In 1883 the line between Richmond station and South Yarra was quadrupled to accommodate an increase in train services due to the opening of Frankston and Sandringham lines.

In 1885, a number of level crossing removal works occurred between Flinders Street station and South Yarra due to an increase in freight and passenger operations. These crossings were removed through a combination of lowering and raising the corridor.

=== 20th century ===
In 1910, the remaining track from Mordialloc to Frankston was duplicated. In 1915, the line between South Yarra and Caulfield was quadrupled, as part of level crossing removal works. This section of the line was lowered into a cutting to eliminate numerous level crossings. Power signalling was provided between Richmond and Hawksburn at the same time, then on to Caulfield in 1921.

Electrification of the line to Frankston occurred in three stages during 1922. In March 1922, the section from South Yarra to Glen Huntly station was electrified, with the section to Mordialloc being electrified in June 1922, and the final section to Frankston being completed by August 1922. The electrification of the line allowed for the introduction of Swing Door electric multiple unit trains for the first time.

The introduction of power signalling on the line begun in 1933 with the section from Caulfield to Glen Huntly, with the remainder of the line converted in stages from 1958 to 1986. The current bridge over the Patterson River was provided in 1974, replacing the previous trestle bridge. Triplication of the line from Caulfield to Moorabbin from two to three tracks was announced by Transport Minister Steve Crabb in 1984, at a cost of A$10 million. Construction of the additional track was designed to increase peak hour capacity and to provide express services on the corridor, with time savings of more than 10 minutes from Frankston. Work begun in July that year with a completion by the end of 1985. The introduction of services on the new track was delayed by two years till June 1987. Further plans announced in the 1970s included the extension of the third track to Mordialloc, however, these plans failed to materialise.

In 1981, Frankston line services commenced operations through the City Loop, after previously terminating at Flinders or Spencer Street stations. The commencement of operations involved the service stopping at three new stations—Parliament, Melbourne Central (formally Museum), and Flagstaff. The Loop follows La Trobe and Spring Streets along the northern and eastern edges of the Hoddle Grid. The Loop connects with Melbourne&#x27;s two busiest stations, Flinders Street and Southern Cross, via the elevated Flinders Street Viaduct.

=== 21st century ===
A 2007, restructure of train ticketing in Melbourne involved the removal of Zone 3, with Zone 3 stations being re-classified to Zone 2. This brought the cost of train fares down, improving system accessibility to the public. All stations between Patterson and Frankston were rezoned to Zone 2.

At the 2010 state election, both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party promised to provide a new Premium station between Highett and Cheltenham, to serve the Westfield Southland shopping centre. The station was projected to cost $13 million, and would have two platforms, an information booth, and shelters with a projected usage of 1,400 passengers daily. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2014, however, no progress was made till after the 2014 state election. The new station opened on 26 November 2017 as Southland station. In 2013, the line, along with the Werribee and Williamstown lines, were upgraded as part of the Bayside Rail Project. The upgrade included station refurbishments, track, signal, and electrical upgrades to allow X&#x27;Trapolis trains to operate on these lines.

In 2021, the metropolitan timetable underwent a major rewrite, resulting in all Frankston line trains operating direct between Richmond and Flinders Street before continuing onto the Werribee and Williamstown lines. Under these changes, Frankston services no longer operate via the City Loop, with an additional 45 new services each week. The additional services upgraded frequencies to a train every 5 minutes in peak hour, every 10 minutes throughout the day, and every 20 minutes until midnight.

== Future ==

=== Level Crossing Removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of all 23 remaining level crossings on the Frankston line, to be completed in stages from 2016 to 2029. Different removal packages have been announced in 2014, 2018, and 2022 to coincide with different state elections and to be delivered in stages up until 2029. All of the various removals have involved the rail under or rail over methods, with some crossing closures also undertaken by the Project. At the conclusion of the project, all level crossings between the city and Frankston station will be full grade operated through a variety of methods.

=== Return to City Loop ===
When the new cross-city rail corridor being built by the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025 there will be a reorganisation of the Melbourne rail network. The Victorian Department of Transport and Planning plans to return the Frankston line to the City Loop, with dedicated use of the Caulfield group tunnel track. This will mean Frankston line trains will no longer through-run with Werribee and Williamstown line trains, and will again stop at City Loop stations Flagstaff, Melbourne Central and Parliament. Werribee and Williamstown services would instead continue onto the Sandringham line.

Stage 4 of the Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail proposed that the Craigieburn and Frankston lines be joined via a reconfigured City Loop sometime in the 2030s.

=== Baxter Extension ===

In 2013, as part of Public Transport Victoria&#x27;s Network Development Plan for metropolitan rail, an extension of the Frankston line to Baxter was earmarked to begin in the &quot;long-term&quot;, which would equate to at least 2033. The proposal would link Frankston to Baxter through an electrified dual-line following the Stony Point line. In 2018, the Liberal Party announced a project to extend electrified services to Baxter during the 2018 state election. The project would have included the removal of all crossings between Frankston and Baxter, duplication and electrification works, the reconstruction and redevelopment of the stations at Leawarra and Langwarrin respectively to facilitate electrification. 

The Federal Liberals announced $450 million of joint funding for the project promised between the state and federal governments. The incumbent Andrews Labor government argued that the project was not needed, instead prioritising funding to other projects across the state. A business case commissioned by the government was completed in 2019 with no further progress being made.

Again in the lead up to the 2022 state election, the Liberal opposition supported the electrification to Baxter. The incumbent Andrews government made no commitments to the Baxter rail extension, instead continuing construction on level crossing removal works along the Frankston line. The 2022 state election resulted in another Labor victory, with the Andrews government pushing ahead with these works, with the extension to Baxter remaining stagnant ever since.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Frankston line operates from approximately 4:00 am to around 11:30 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 10 minutes during the peak period while services during non-peak hours drops to 10–20 minutes throughout the entire route. Rather than running through the City Loop, services continue onto the Werribee (express or via the Altona Loop) or Williamstown lines (with varying frequencies). On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Freight operations occur (usually) twice-daily, with Qube Holdings operating services to the Long Island steel mills and the Port of Hastings. Trains to Melbourne run approximately at 4 am and during the mid-afternoon, while trains from Melbourne run approximately at midnight and noon.

Train services on the Frankston line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===

The Frankston line has had a total of 7 operators since its opening in 1881. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1881 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 118 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Frankston line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Frankston line forms a somewhat linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Frankston. The route is long and is predominantly doubled tracked, however between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to 6 tracks between Richmond and South Yarra before again narrowing to 4 tracks between South Yarra and Caulfield. After Caulfield station, the track again narrows to 3 tracks, which is remain till Moorabbin when the track narrows to two tracks. The centre track is signalled for bidirectional operation, allowing for express trains overtaking stopping trains in the peak direction. After changing from Werribee and Williamstown services at Flinders Street, Frankston line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. However, between South Yarra and Malvern, the rail corridor has been lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings, and between Malvern and Caulfield, the corridor has been raised on an embankment for the same reason. After Caulfield, the line formerly had numerous level crossings, however, all have now been abolished through numerous rail trenches and rail bridges. Remaining level crossings on the line will be removed by 2029 under other level crossing removal works.

The line follows the same alignment as the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines with the three services splitting onto different routes at Caulfield. The Frankston line continues on its south eastern alignment, whereas the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines takes an eastern alignment towards their final destinations. From Mentone, the line is never more than ~ from the eastern shore of Port Phillip Bay, and runs alongside the Nepean Highway for much of its length. At Frankston station, electrified services terminate with Metro Trains operated diesel services continuing to Stony Point. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas, with small sections of the line passing through more open countryside, passing by open fields and farms.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 28 stations across the length of the line. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. From 2023, Glen Huntly station will be lowered as part of level crossing removal works. In 2025, Parkdale station will be elevated, with Highett, Mordialloc, and Seaford stations being elevated from 2029 for similar works. Aspendale station will also be lowered from 2029.


== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Frankston line uses three different types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs, built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1988. These train sets are the oldest on the Melbourne rail network and subsequently will be replaced by the mid-2030s. Siemens Nexas EMUs are also widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005 these train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains. The final type of rolling stock featured on the line is the X&#x27;Trapolis 100 built by Alstom between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2020. All of these rolling stock models are widely used on other lines across the metropolitan network and work as the backbone of the network.

Alongside the passenger trains, Frankston line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Planned rolling stock ====
From the middle of 2020s, the next generation of the X&#x27;Trapolis family of electric EMUs—the X&#x27;Trapolis 2.0—will be introduced. This new model will fully replace the existing fleet of Comeng EMUs currently operating on the line currently with new, modern, and technologically advanced trains. The new trains will include features designed to increase passenger comfort like quicker doors, allowing for reduced boarding times, passenger information systems to display relevant information about the train and its journey, designated bicycle storage areas, and 6 cars that are fully walk through. For reliability, the trains have a higher energy efficiency to work with a lower network voltage. Finally, accessibility is improved through new interior designs featuring fold-up seating to allow additional space for wheelchair users and passenger operated automatic wheelchair ramps (located behind the two driver cabs).

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. The majority of stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, some stations have not been upgraded. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades and other individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 68% of Frankston line stations classed as fully accessible. This number is expected to grow within the coming years with the completion of level crossing removal works on the corridor by 2029.

=== Signalling ===
The Frankston line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced in 1915, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 1976.

<text>David Wooster ( – May 2, 1777) was an American general who served in the French and Indian War and in the American Revolutionary War. He died of wounds sustained during the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut. Several cities, schools, and public places were named after him thereafter. He has been called &quot;a largely forgotten hero of the Revolution.&quot;

==Early years==

David Wooster was born in Stratford, in the British colony of Connecticut. He entered Yale College in 1735, and graduated in 1738.

In 1739, following the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain, he joined the colonial militia as a lieutenant, but apparently saw no action. In 1741 he was named lieutenant of a ship of the &quot;guarda-costa&quot;, which the colony had established to protect against potential Spanish attack. He was later promoted to captain.

On March 6, 1745, Wooster married Marie Clapp, the daughter of Yale&#x27;s president, Thomas Clapp. They went on to have four children; their son Thomas also served in the American Revolutionary War. His grandson Charles Whiting Wooster was Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Navy. Shortly after his marriage, David Wooster was named captain of a company in the provincial regiment of Andrew Burr (uncle to future United States Vice President Aaron Burr), and saw service at that year&#x27;s Siege of Louisbourg. He was sent to France as part of the prisoner escort following that action, and then to England, where he was given an audience with King George and a position as captain in the regiment of William Pepperrell in the British Army.

When the French and Indian War broke out, he served from 1755 to the war&#x27;s end in 1761, during which he was promoted to colonel and given command of the 3rd Connecticut Regiment. In 1758 his regiment was at the disastrous Battle of Carillon before Fort Ticonderoga, and in 1759 at the successful capture of Ticonderoga.

==Early Revolutionary War service==

When the American Revolutionary War broke out with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, Wooster was in charge of the militia at New Haven. Benedict Arnold wanted to march with his militia company in support of the cause, but Wooster tried to deny Arnold access to the militia&#x27;s weapons stores. Arnold&#x27;s threats were persuasive, and Wooster opened the magazine to him. (This confrontation is commemorated in New Haven as Powder House Day.) Wooster was first given command as a major general of Connecticut militia companies sent to defend New York City against possible British troop landings. When the Continental Army was established, Wooster was commissioned a brigadier general, and his troops were sent to be part of General Philip Schuyler and General Richard Montgomery&#x27;s 1775 invasion of Quebec. Wooster participated in the Siege of Fort St. Jean in the fall of 1775, and was then given military command of Montreal after that city fell in November. He assumed command of all the forces in Quebec following the death of Montgomery in the Battle of Quebec at the end of December 1775.

Wooster&#x27;s management of Montreal was marked by deteriorating relations with the inhabitants, as efforts to rein in Loyalist activity ended up frustrating even sympathetic locals. He was eventually charged with incompetence over his tenure at Montreal; the court martial cleared him. In April 1776 Wooster took reinforcements to relieve General Arnold, who was besieging Quebec City. Wooster was only briefly in command there, as General John Thomas arrived at the end of April. In early May, British reinforcements arrived at Quebec, and the army was routed, eventually retreating in disarray back to Fort Ticonderoga in July.

Wooster returned to Connecticut, where he assumed command of the entire provincial militia responsible for the state&#x27;s defense as the state&#x27;s first major general.

==Danbury raid==

British General (and former provincial governor of New York) William Tryon launched an expedition in April 1777 to raid a Continental Army supply depot at Danbury, Connecticut. On April 25, about 2,000 British troops landed near Fairfield, and marched inland, reaching Danbury without resistance on the morning of April 26. They chased away the small garrison, destroyed a large number of supplies, and set fire to parts of the town. When Wooster was alerted to this movement, he notified General Arnold, who was visiting his family in New Haven, and set about calling out the militia to oppose the action. Arnold took several hundred men to set up a position at Ridgefield, while Wooster took a smaller detachment to harass the rear of Tryon&#x27;s column as they returned to the coast. His first attack caught Tryon by surprise, but he was prepared for Wooster&#x27;s second attack, which was made as the column neared Ridgefield. Wooster was mortally wounded when the Redcoats unlimbered six artillery pieces and opened fire. He was taken to the Dibble House in Danbury where he died on May 2, 1777. Wooster&#x27;s final words were, &quot;I am dying, but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence.&quot;

==Memorials==

On June 17, 1777, Congress voted that a suitable monument should be erected in his memory, but measures were never inaugurated to execute the resolution. His grave was not identified until 1854, when Connecticut legislature laid the cornerstone of a monument. A sign and a monument on Connecticut Route 116 (North Salem Road) just a few yards away from the intersection with Tackora Trail, marks the spot where General David Wooster fell, during the Battle of Ridgefield in 1777. Today, a monument high marks his final resting place. General Wooster is buried in Wooster Cemetery on Mount Moriah in Danbury, which dates from the middle of the nineteenth century. Wooster&#x27;s monument is surrounded by a stone and iron railing. The monument is heavily carved with a variety of military and Masonic symbols, as well as classical Greek motifs. Among extensive information carved into the monument is this quote, &quot;Of his country Wooster said, &#x27;my life has ever been devoted to her services from my youth up, though never before in a cause like this—a cause for which I would most cheerfully risk and lay down my life&#x27;.&quot;

His death is subject of a poem (&quot;On the Death of General Wooster&quot;) by Phillis Wheatley, included in a letter Wheatley wrote to the General&#x27;s widow, Mary, on July 15, 1778.

In the 1820s, the city of New Haven converted a small pasture into a public square and named it Wooster Square after Wooster. Today, the entire neighborhood, as well as several streets, all carry Wooster&#x27;s name. The neighborhood was the center of large-scale Italian immigration to the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and still retains a large Italian presence today.

Wooster School, a private day school, Wooster Mountain State Park and numerous streets are named after Wooster in Danbury, Bethel, and Ridgefield. Also named for him are David Wooster Middle School, a public school in Stratford, Connecticut, a street in SoHo, New York City, and the city of Wooster, Ohio (which houses the College of Wooster and the appropriately named Wooster High School Generals).

Ben Douglass, in his 1878 history of Wayne County, Ohio, characterized Wooster as &quot;a man of prepossessing appearance, of rare intellectual culture and accomplished education.&quot;

<doc id="827452" wikidata="Q7330684" url="?curid=827452" title="Woodcliff Lake Reservoir">
<text>Woodcliff Lake is the name of a reservoir in Woodcliff Lake and portions of Hillsdale and Park Ridge, in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. It was created circa 1903 by damming the Pascack Brook and is also fed by the Bear Brook which joins the Pascack at the reservoir. The creation of the lake led what had been the Borough of Woodcliff to change its name to Woodcliff Lake, to match the name of the new reservoir. The reservoir is owned by Suez North America, a private utility.

The reservoir has a capacity of approximately of water. Water released into the Pascack Brook flows downstream into the Oradell Reservoir. When the water levels become low, the old stone bridge over the Pascack Brook becomes visible just south of the causeway.

Several species of fish inhabit the reservoir including largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, carp, pumpkinseed, bluegill, brown and yellow bullheads, as well as large schools of both yellow and white perch. Fishing is restricted to those with a valid New Jersey Fishing License and a Watershed Permit obtained by payment of a yearly fee to the owner of the reservoir, Suez North America. Numerous waterfowl including various species of ducks and heron also live on and around the reservoir.

The reservoir may be crossed at two points, either by a narrow road over the dam, originally Dam Road and changed to Church Road when Christ Lutheran Church was built at the Pascack Road entrance, or a higher traffic county road over a causeway, Woodcliff Avenue. On the eastern side of the reservoir is the New Jersey Transit Pascack Valley Line, with the Woodcliff Lake station stop at Woodcliff Avenue.

On March 11, 2003, Governor of New Jersey Jim McGreevey visited the nearby Lake Tappan reservoir and proposed protecting it, Woodcliff Lake and their tributaries with Category 1 water purity status.

<text>The Catherine Palace (, ) is a Rococo palace in Tsarskoye Selo (Pushkin), located south of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was the summer residence of the Russian tsars. The palace is part of the World Heritage Site Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments.

==History==
Following the Great Northern War, Russia recovered the farm called Saari Mojs (a high place) or Sarskaya Myza, which resided on a hill 65 m in elevation. In 1710, Peter the Great gave the estate to his wife Catherine I, the village of which was initially called Sarskoye Selo, and then finally Tsarskoye Selo (Tsar&#x27;s Village). In 1723, Catherine I&#x27;s Stone Palace, designed by Johann Friedrich Braunstein and built by Johann Ferster, replaced the original wooden house. This was a two-storey sixteen-room building, with state chambers finished in polished alabaster, while the upper one included Gobelin tapestry. The southeast portion of the estate included a garden designed by Jan Roosen, with terraces, stone staircases, parterres, trellised arbours, and ponds, while a menagerie was located on the opposite of the estate.
During the reign of Peter the Great&#x27;s daughter, Empress Elizabeth, Mikhail Zemtsov designed a new palace and work began in 1744. In 1745, Zemtsov&#x27;s pupil, Andrei Kvasov, working with Savva Chevakinsky, expanded the palace to be 300 m long. This included a Middle House, two side wings, a chapel, and the Conservatory Hall, all connected by four galleries with hanging gardens. Then in 1751, Bartolomeo Rastrelli undertook a major reconstruction effort, integrating several buildings, giving the palace its distinctive snow-white columns, sky-blue walls, with gilded stucco, chapel cupolas, and sculptures requiring almost 100 kg of gold. Rastrelli&#x27;s interiors were based on a Baroque style. Sculptor Johann Franz Dunker, master gilder Leprince, and interior painter Giuseppe Valeriani were some of the distinguished artists. Other notable rooms included the Chinese Room with its porcelain and Coromandel lacquer panels, the Portrait Hall, the Light Gallery, and the Amber Room with Andreas Schlüter&#x27;s amber panels, while 5 anterooms were connected to the Great Hall, which measured 860 square meters. Construction ended in 1756, when the palace included 40 state apartments, and more than 100 private and service rooms. A New Garden was added, while the Old Garden was improved with a deepening of the Big Pond, connected to springs 6 km away, the addition of a Toboggan Slide, plus the Hermitage, Grotto, Island, and Mon Bijou pavilions.

Baroque architecture gave way to Neoclassical architecture in the 1770s, when Tsarskoye Selo became the summer residence of Catherine the Great&#x27;s court. Yuri Velten redesigned the south facade of the palace, while the side wings were converted from one-storey into four-storey Zubov and Chapel Annexes. The Main Staircase was replaced by state and private rooms such as the Chinese Room, decorated with Charles Cameron designs, and a new staircase built in the center where the Chinese Room had stood. Cameron&#x27;s 1780s interior designs included the Arabesque Room with arabesque painted ceiling, walls, and doors, while Greek and Roman classical motifs were used on the wall vertical panels. Cameron&#x27;s Lyons Room used French golden-yellow silk on the walls, while the doors, stoves and panels used Lake Baikal lapis lazuli. The empress&#x27; bedroom used Wedgwood jasper bas-reliefs designed by John Flaxman and George Stubbs. The Blue Room, or &quot;Snuff-box&quot;, incorporated white and bright blue glass on the walls. Giacomo Quarenghi designed the Mirror and Silver Rooms in 1789, while Rastrelli&#x27;s hanging gardens were pulled down in 1773.

Vasily Neyolov&#x27;s 1768 master plan for Tsarskoye Selo was elaborated in 1771 by Johann Busch and implemented. Antonio Rinaldi added the Chesme Column, Morea Column, and the Kagul Obelisk to commemorate the victorious Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). Neyolov&#x27;s Gothic monuments included the Admiralty, the Hermitage Kitchen and Red (Turkish) Cascade, and his Chinese motifs included the Creaking Pagoda and the Great Caprice. Neyolov&#x27;s Early Classicism monuments included the Upper and Lower Baths. Neyolov built the Opera House in 1778–79. In the 1780s, Cameron added the Thermae as part of Catherine the Great&#x27;s &quot;Greek-Roman rhapsody&quot;, and started building the Chinese Village. Quarenghi added a music pavilion and Ceres temple to an Upper Pond island. His Kitchen Ruin folly was added next to the Concert Hall. Neyolov&#x27;s Babolovo Palace was added by 1785, and in the 1790s, Quarenghi built the Alexander Palace. In 1809, Luigi Rusca built the Granite Terrace. In 1817, Stasov built the Triumphal Arch commemorating the Russian repulsion of the French invasion of Russia. From 1851 to 1852, Monighetti added the Turkish Bath.
With Catherine the Great&#x27;s death in 1796, park construction ceased. Vasily Stasov restored the damage caused by the 1820 fire, which included Rastrelli&#x27;s chapel and adjoining apartments. In the 1850s, Andrei Stakenschneider decorated the state room ceilings with stucco ornament and Hermitage Museum canvases. In 1860, Ippolito Monighetti reconstructed the central staircase and main porch.

When the German forces retreated after the siege of Leningrad in World War II, they intentionally destroyed the residence, leaving only the hollow shell of the palace behind. Soviet archivists had managed to document a fair amount of the interior before the war, which proved of great importance in reconstructing the palace starting in 1957, by the State Control Commission for the Preservation of Monuments under the direction of Alexander Kedrinsky.

== Layout ==


Although Stasov&#x27;s and Cameron&#x27;s Neoclassical interiors are manifestations of late 18th-century and early 19th-century taste, the palace is best known for Rastrelli&#x27;s grand suit of formal rooms known as the Golden Enfilade. It starts at the spacious airy ballroom, the &quot;Grand Hall&quot; or the &quot;Hall of Lights&quot;, with a spectacular painted ceiling, and comprises numerous distinctively decorated smaller rooms, including the recreated Amber Room.
The Great Hall, or Light Gallery, as it was called in the 18th century, is a formal apartment in the Russian baroque style designed by Bartolomeo Rastrelli between 1752 and 1756. The Great Hall was intended for more important receptions such as balls, formal dinners, and masquerades. The hall was painted in two colors and covers an area of approximately 1,000 square meters. Occupying the entire width of the palace, the windows on the eastern side look out onto the park while the windows of the western side look out to the palace plaza. In the evening, 696 lamps are lit on about a dozen chandeliers located near the mirrors. The hall&#x27;s sculptural and gilded carvings and ornamentation were created according to sketches by Rastrelli and models by Johann Franz Dunker.
Beyond the Great Hall is the Courtiers-in-Attendance Dining Room. The room was designed by Rastrelli in the mid-18th century. The small room is lit by four windows which look out into the formal courtyard. The architect placed false windows with mirrors and mirrored glass on the opposite wall, making the hall more spacious and bright. Decorated in the typical Baroque interior style, the hall is filled with gilded wall-carvings, complex gilded pieces on the doors, and ornamental patterns of stylized flowers. The ceiling mural was painted by a well-known student of the Russian School from the mid-18th century. It is based on the Greek myth of the sun god Helios and the goddess of the dawn, Eos.

Across from the Courtiers-in-Attendance Dining Room, on the other side of the Main Staircase, is the White Formal Dining Room. The hall was used for the empresses&#x27; formal dinners or &quot;evening meals&quot;. The walls of the dining hall were decorated with the utmost extravagance with gilded carvings. The furnishings consist of gilded carvings on the consoles. Some of the furniture which can be seen in the room today is original whilst other pieces are reproductions. The painted mural, &quot;The Triumph of Apollo&quot;, is a copy of a painting completed in the 16th century by Italian artist Guido Reni.

The Portrait Hall is a formal apartment covering 100 square meters. The room&#x27;s walls boast large formal portraits of Empress Catherine I and Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, as well as paintings of Natalya Alexeyevna, sister of Peter the Great, and Empress Catherine II. The inlaid floors of the hall contain precious woods. The Drawing Room of Alexander I was designed between 1752 and 1756 and belonged to the Emperor&#x27;s private suite. The drawing room stood out from the rest of the formal rooms in the palace due to the fact that the walls were covered in Chinese silk. Other decor in the room was typical for the palace&#x27;s formal rooms—a ceiling mural and gilded carvings. The elegant card tables and inlaid wood commode display Japanese, Chinese, and Berlin porcelain.

The Green Dining Room, which replaced Rastrelli&#x27;s &quot;Hanging Garden&quot; in 1773, is the first of the rooms in the northern wing of the Catherine Palace, designed by Cameron for the future Emperor Paul and his wife. The room&#x27;s pistachio-coloured walls are lined with stucco figures by Ivan Martos. During the great fire of 1820 the room was seriously damaged, thus sharing the fate of other Cameron interiors. It was subsequently restored under Stasov&#x27;s direction.

Other interiors by Cameron include the Waiters&#x27; Room, with an inlaid floor of rosewood, amaranth and mahogany and stylish Chippendale card tables; the Blue Formal Dining-Room, with white-and-blue silk wallpaper and Carrara marble chimneys; the Chinese Blue Drawing Room, a curious combination of Adam style with Chinoiserie; the Choir Anteroom, with walls lined in apricot-colored silk; and the columned boudoir of elisha busailo I, executed in the Pompeian style.

<text>Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, portrayed by Matthew Perry. Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called &quot;Viva Las Gay-gas&quot; as Helena Handbasket. It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.

Chandler&#x27;s best friends are his roommate Joey Tribbiani, and Ross Geller, his college roommate. He met Ross&#x27;s sister, Monica Geller, and her friend Rachel Green while visiting Ross&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross&#x27;s love for Rachel. He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica. He meets Phoebe Buffay through her. Chandler has a very good sense of humor and is notoriously sarcastic, which he credits as a defense mechanism developed during his parents&#x27; divorce when he was a child. He is the most financially secure member of the Friends due to responsible income management, having learned the value of money at a young age. He suffers from commitment issues, but he later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, Chandler and Monica adopt twins, Jack and Erica.

==Appearances==
Chandler works in &quot;statistical analysis and data reconfiguration,&quot; but loathes it, although it pays well.

Chandler was Ross Geller&#x27;s roommate in college. Chandler met his future wife Monica Geller while celebrating Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment number 19 in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe Buffay. After his roommate Kip moves out, actor Joey Tribbiani moves in with Chandler, who becomes his best friend.

Ross and Chandler have been best friends since their freshman year in college, where they were roommates. They were in a band together called “Way No Way”. Chandler also learned &quot;Hug and Roll&quot; from Ross when he was dating Janice.

Until moving in with Monica, Chandler shared an apartment with Joey. Chandler and Joey&#x27;s apartment is an important focal point for the series as one of the few meeting areas of the gang. The two form a close and enduring friendship, and get into many humorous situations. In the pilot episode of the sequel series &quot;Joey&quot;, Joey&#x27;s sister Gina briefly expresses her belief that Joey and Chandler were a gay couple.

When Chandler first meets Joey and interviews him as a roommate, the two start off on the wrong foot when Joey says that he is &quot;cool with the gay thing&quot; (Joey assuming that Chandler is gay). Chandler initially chooses Eric, a fashion photographer with a porn-star sister as his roommate, but after their eccentric neighbor Mr. Heckles (Larry Hankin) tells Eric that &quot;he&quot; is Chandler&#x27;s new roommate and is able to open Chandler&#x27;s unlocked door, Eric leaves. Chandler assumes that Eric simply did not turn up, and he gives the keys to Joey, but soon finds that they have a lot in common, including a fondness for &quot;Baywatch&quot; and beer. Chandler often supports Joey throughout the show, by always supporting Joey at every step of his roller-coaster of a career in show business besides paying the rent, paying for Joey&#x27;s head-shots, buying most of the food, and even giving money to Joey for his numerous dates. Even when buying a new house for his own family, Chandler reveals that he is going to have a &#x27;Joey room&#x27; in it for him.

The relationship between the two is balanced: Joey looks to Chandler as his intellectual superior, while Chandler acknowledges Joey as the more confident counterpart, especially when it comes to romance and Chandler often takes advice from Joey on how to date women.

Chandler and Rachel originally did not like each other, but grew to become good friends. Rachel does not understand Chandler&#x27;s sarcasm early in the series, and even later on has a hard time appreciating his sense of humor, as she acknowledges in the final episode. In &quot;The One with All the Cheesecakes&quot;, Chandler and Rachel steal and share the cheesecake which originally belonged to their downstairs neighbor. Rachel, who works for Ralph Lauren Corporation, is also the one who helps Chandler pick out his wedding suit. Rachel also sets up Chandler with her boss Joanna (Alison La Placa). Rachel and Chandler never have any romantic relationships apart from a glance back to their time in college when they made out. In &quot;The One with the Flashback,&quot; Rachel is shown briefly fantasizing about Chandler at the end of the episode.

Chandler and Phoebe are good friends. Although Phoebe mocks Chandler frequently, they sometimes are goofy and have fun with one another. In &quot;The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel&quot;, Phoebe and Chandler play hide and seek. They also play games, like coming up with superhero names and reclining the Barcaloungers like cowboys. They share a duet of &quot;Endless Love&quot; at the end of one episode, when Chandler is sad after a breakup with his on-off girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler). In &quot;The One Where Everyone Finds Out&quot;, she tries to trick him into believing that she is attracted to him, but Monica tells him that Phoebe finds him charming in a &quot;sexless&quot; way, indicating that any hints of romance are jokes. Phoebe is the initial reason that Chandler quit smoking in &quot;The One with the Thumb&quot;, after an argument between the group about his smoking. He is leaving the apartment when she offers him $7,000 to never smoke again.

Chandler is brash, zany, and estranged from both of his parents. He suffers from commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of what a stable marriage looks like, can be neurotic and extremely defensive, with humor as his shield. Chandler also views everything associated with his parents&#x27; divorce in a negative light, specifically Thanksgiving when his parents revealed their separation over a turkey as his father planned to run away with the house boy.

Both of Chandler&#x27;s parents are extremely promiscuous, and he has made several allusions to having caught them during sexual acts. Most of these involve his father with other men. Among other things, he alludes to having witnessed orgies by the time he was seven years old, and playing &quot;the far left&quot; background dancer during his father&#x27;s rendition of &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; when he was growing up. His mother Nora is a world famous writer of erotic novels, which is demonstrated when Rachel&#x27;s short-term boyfriend Paolo – who is Italian and barely speaks any English – is shown to know her.

Chandler began smoking when he was nine years old after his parents announced their divorce. Chandler is first seen smoking during the first season and is chastised by his friends for breaking his non-smoking streak of three years. He does a fairly good job at controlling his habit throughout the series&#x27; run, although a few times he cannot resist temptation and has a single cigarette or just a single drag off someone else&#x27;s. His only major relapse occurs in season 9 when he stays in Oklahoma four days a week for work and smoked &quot;three cartons in three days&quot; because all his colleagues lit up during work meetings. He promises Monica never to smoke again, and is not seen smoking in the series after this point. But, there is evidence of him still smoking in Season 10 when Monica caught the smell of cigarettes on him after he came home from seeing the house Monica and Chandler buys in Westchester. Chandler does not deny the allegation.

Chandler&#x27;s main catchphrase is starting sentences with &quot;Could that BE any more...&quot;

===Relationships===
At Ross&#x27;s wedding in London, Monica and Chandler sleep together and decide to begin dating. They try to keep their relationship secret, as they are unsure about how the others would react. Eventually, however, they all find out and give their blessing. Things briefly become strained when Monica reveals that she had initially been looking for Joey for a one-night-stand, but they reconcile. Their wedding takes place during the finale of season 7. In the final episode of the series, Monica and Chandler adopt twins.

Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler has an on-and-off relationship with Janice Litman. She is a regular feature in his life, even though he regrets dating her and keeps ending their relationship throughout season 1. He calls her in season 2 out of fear of being alone, only to find out she is married and pregnant. In the season 2 finale, they meet after unknowingly chatting with each other online when her husband cheats on her, and they quickly get back together. The relationship lasts through the first few episodes of season 3, with Chandler genuinely infatuated by her, but when she kisses her husband whilst in the midst of her divorce, Chandler urges her to go back to her husband, not wanting to destroy her family. Janice makes further appearances later in the series, after they have both married other people.

Kathy (Paget Brewster) makes an appearance in the fourth season of &quot;Friends&quot;. Chandler sees her in Central Perk and asks the gang if he should ask her out, only to learn that she was already waiting for a date with Joey. Chandler and Kathy then fall for each other even though she is dating Joey. This causes huge friction between Joey and Chandler, but this is resolved and Chandler and Kathy get together and begin dating. She is an actress, and Chandler gets extremely paranoid when she shares a sex scene with her co-star, prompting a big fight between the two. Chandler&#x27;s paranoia drives Kathy into having an affair with the co-star, and Chandler and Kathy split up.

== Career ==
For most of the series, Chandler works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, although he grows to loathe the job. He succeeds in transitioning to a junior copywriter position by the end of the series. Despite disliking his initial job, Chandler stays because they keep giving him promotions and raises, eventually placing him as boss to his former coworkers. His friends do not understand what he does; during the contest for Monica and Rachel&#x27;s apartment, Rachel desperately guesses &quot;Transponster&quot; for his job title (to which Monica replies in anguish, &quot;THAT&#x27;S NOT EVEN A WORD!&quot;). This results in Chandler and Joey winning their apartment.

In the episode &quot;The One Where Emma Cries&quot;, Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler quits his job on Christmas so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. Much to Chandler&#x27;s dismay, he begins as an unpaid intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior copywriter, which he enjoys much more than his previous career.

<doc id="827469" wikidata="Q62407" url="?curid=827469" title="Mother Courage and Her Children">
<text>Mother Courage and Her Children () is a play written in 1939 by the German dramatist and poet Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956), with significant contributions from Margarete Steffin. Four theatrical productions were produced in Switzerland and Germany from 1941 to 1952, the last three supervised or directed by Brecht, who had returned to East Germany from the United States.

Several years after Brecht&#x27;s death in 1956, the play was adapted as a German film, &quot;Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder&quot; (1961), starring Helene Weigel, Brecht&#x27;s widow and a leading actress.

&quot;Mother Courage&quot; is considered by Oskar Eustis to be the greatest play of the 20th century, and perhaps also the greatest anti-war play of all time. Critic Brett D. Johnson points out, &quot;Although numerous theatrical artists and scholars may share artistic director Oskar Eustis&#x27;s opinion that Brecht&#x27;s masterpiece is the greatest play of the twentieth century, productions of &quot;Mother Courage&quot; remain a rarity in contemporary American theatre.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The play is set in the 17th century in Europe during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Recruiting Officer and Sergeant are introduced, both complaining about the difficulty of recruiting soldiers to the war. Anna Fierling (Mother Courage) enters pulling a cart containing provisions for sale to soldiers, and introduces her children Eilif, Kattrin, and Schweizerkas (&quot;Swiss Cheese&quot;). The sergeant negotiates a deal with Mother Courage while Eilif is conscripted by the Recruiting Officer.

Two years thereafter, Mother Courage argues with a Protestant General&#x27;s cook over a capon, and Eilif is congratulated by the General for killing peasants and slaughtering their cattle. Eilif and his mother sing &quot;The Fishwife and the Soldier&quot;. Mother Courage scolds her son for endangering himself.

Three years later, Swiss Cheese works as an army paymaster. The camp prostitute, Yvette Pottier, sings &quot;The Fraternization Song&quot;. Mother Courage uses this song to warn Kattrin against involving herself with soldiers. Before the Catholic troops arrive, the Cook and Chaplain bring a message from Eilif. Swiss Cheese hides the regiment&#x27;s paybox from invading soldiers, and Mother Courage and companions change their insignia from Protestant to Catholic. Swiss Cheese is captured and tortured by the Catholics, having hidden the paybox by the river. Mother Courage attempts bribery to free him, planning to pawn the wagon first and redeem it with the regiment money. When Swiss Cheese claims that he has thrown the box in the river, Mother Courage backtracks on the price, and Swiss Cheese is killed. Fearing to be shot as an accomplice, Mother Courage does not acknowledge his body, and it is discarded.

Later, Mother Courage waits outside the General&#x27;s tent to register a complaint and sings the &quot;Song of Great Capitulation&quot; to a young soldier anxious to complain of inadequate pay. The song persuades both to withdraw their complaints.

Mother Courage grows desperate to protect her business, so much so that she refuses to give fabric to treat wounded civilians. The Chaplain takes her supplies anyway.

When Catholic General Tilly&#x27;s funeral approaches, the Chaplain tells Mother Courage that the war will still continue, and she is persuaded to pile up stocks. The Chaplain then suggests to Mother Courage that she marry him, but she rejects his proposal. Mother Courage curses the war because she finds Kattrin disfigured after being raped by a drunken soldier. Thereafter Mother Courage is again following the Protestant army.

While two peasants are trying to sell merchandise to her, they hear news of peace with the death of the Swedish king. The Cook appears and causes an argument between Mother Courage and the Chaplain. Mother Courage is off to the market while Eilif enters, dragged in by soldiers. Eilif is executed for killing a peasant while stealing livestock, trying to repeat the same act for which he was praised as hero in wartime, but Mother Courage never hears thereof. When she finds out the war continues, the Cook and Mother Courage move on with the wagon.

In the seventeenth year of the war, there is no food and no supplies. The Cook inherits an inn in Utrecht and suggests to Mother Courage that she operate it with him – but he refuses to harbour Kattrin because he fears that her disfigurement will repel potential customers. Thereafter Mother Courage and Kattrin pull the wagon by themselves.

When Mother Courage is trading in the Protestant city of Halle, Kattrin is left with a peasant family in the countryside overnight. As Catholic soldiers force the peasants to guide the army to the city for a sneak attack, Kattrin fetches a drum from the cart and beats it, waking the townspeople, but is herself shot. Early in the morning, Mother Courage sings a lullaby to her daughter&#x27;s corpse, has the peasants bury it, and hitches herself to the cart.

==Context==
&quot;Mother Courage&quot; is one of nine plays that Brecht wrote in resistance to the rise of Fascism and Nazism. In response to the invasion of Poland by the German armies of Adolf Hitler in 1939, Brecht wrote &quot;Mother Courage&quot; in what writers call a &quot;white heat&quot;—in a little over a month. As the preface to the Ralph Manheim/John Willett &quot;Collected Play&quot;s puts it: 

Following Brecht&#x27;s own principles for political drama, the play is not set in modern times but during the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648, which involved all the German states, France and Sweden. It follows the fortunes of Anna Fierling, nicknamed Mother Courage, a wily canteen woman with the Swedish Army, who is determined to make her living from the war. Over the course of the play, she loses all three of her children, Schweizerkas, Eilif, and Kattrin, to the very war from which she tried to profit.

==Overview==
The name of the central character, Mother Courage, is drawn from the picaresque writings of the 17th-century German writer Grimmelshausen. His central character in the early short novel, &quot;The Runagate Courage,&quot; also struggles and connives her way through the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany and Poland. Otherwise the story is mostly Brecht&#x27;s, in collaboration with Steffin.

The action of the play takes place over the course of 12 years (1624 to 1636), represented in 12 scenes. Some give a sense of Courage&#x27;s career, but do not provide time for viewers to develop sentimental feelings and empathize with any of the characters. Meanwhile, Mother Courage is not depicted as a noble character. The Brechtian epic theatre distinguished itself from the ancient Greek tragedies, in which the heroes are far above the average. Neither does Brecht&#x27;s ending of his play inspire any desire to imitate the main character, Mother Courage.

&quot;Mother Courage&quot; is among Brecht&#x27;s most famous plays. Some directors consider it to be the greatest play of the 20th century. Brecht expresses the dreadfulness of war and the idea that virtues are not rewarded in corrupt times. He used an epic structure to force the audience to focus on the issues rather than getting involved with the characters and their emotions. Epic plays are a distinct genre typical of Brecht. Some critics believe that he created the form.

===As epic theatre===
&quot;Mother Courage&quot; is an example of Brecht&#x27;s concepts of epic theatre and &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;, or &quot;V&quot; effect; preferably &quot;alienation&quot; or &quot;estrangement effect&quot; &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; is achieved through the use of placards which reveal the events of each scene, juxtaposition, actors changing characters and costume on stage, the use of narration, simple props and scenery. For instance, a single tree would be used to convey a whole forest, and the stage is usually flooded with bright white light, whether the scene depicted is a winter&#x27;s night or a summer&#x27;s day. Several songs, interspersed throughout the play, are used to underscore the themes of the play. They also require the audience to think about what the playwright is saying.

==Performances==
=== In German ===
The play was originally produced at the Schauspielhaus Zürich, produced by Leopold Lindtberg in 1941. Most of the score consisted of original compositions by the Swiss composer Paul Burkhard; the rest had been arranged by him. The musicians were placed in view of the audience so that they could be seen, one of Brecht&#x27;s many techniques in epic theatre. Therese Giehse, a well-known actress at the time, took the title role. Teo Otto designed the stage.

The second production of &quot;Mother Courage&quot; took place in then East Berlin in 1949, with Brecht&#x27;s (second) wife Helene Weigel, his main actress and later also director, as Mother Courage. Paul Dessau supplied a new score, composed in close collaboration with Brecht himself. This production would highly influence the formation of Brecht&#x27;s company, the Berliner Ensemble, which would provide him a venue to direct many of his plays. (Brecht died directing &quot;Galileo&quot; for the Ensemble.) Brecht revised the play for this production in reaction to the reviews of the Zürich production, which empathized with the &quot;heart-rending vitality of all maternal creatures&quot;. Even so, he wrote that the Berlin audience failed to see Mother Courage&#x27;s crimes and participation in the war and focused on her suffering instead.

The next production (and second production in Germany) was directed by Brecht at the Munich Kammerspiele in 1950, with the original Mother Courage, Therese Giehse, and with a set designed by Teo Otto (see photo, above.)

=== In other languages ===
In Spanish, the play was first staged in Argentina in 1953 at Teatro IFT in Buenos Aires, with Cipe Lincovsky in the title role. In 1972, Henry Jayasena adapted the play into Sinhalese, under the title &quot;Diriya Mawa Saha Agey Daruwo&quot; (The Brave Mother and Her Children).

==Brecht&#x27;s reaction==
After the 1941 performances in Switzerland, Brecht believed critics had misunderstood the play. While many sympathized with Courage, Brecht&#x27;s goal was to show that Mother Courage was wrong for not understanding the circumstances she and her children were in. According to Hans Mayer, Brecht changed the play for the 1949 performances in East Berlin to make Courage less sympathetic to the audience. However, according to Mayer, these alterations did not significantly change the audience&#x27;s sympathy for Courage. Katie Baker, in a retrospective article about &quot;Mother Courage&quot; on its 75th anniversary, notes that &quot;[Brecht&#x27;s audiences] were missing the point of his &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;, that breaking of the fourth wall which was supposed to make the masses think, not feel, in order to nudge them in a revolutionary direction.&quot; She also quotes Brecht as lamenting: &quot;The (East Berliner) audiences of 1949 did not see Mother Courage&#x27;s crimes, her participation, her desire to share in the profits of the war business; they saw only her failure, her sufferings.&quot;

==Popular culture==
The German feminist newspaper &quot;Courage&quot;, published from 1976 to 1984, was named after Mother Courage, whom the editors saw as a &quot;self-directed woman ... not a starry-eyed idealist but neither is she satisfied with the status quo&quot;.

&quot;Mother Courage&quot; was the inspiration for Lynn Nottage&#x27;s Pulitzer winning play &quot;Ruined&quot;, written after Nottage spent time with Congolese women in Ugandan refugee camps.

<doc id="827473" wikidata="Q460092" url="?curid=827473" title="A New Day... Live in Las Vegas">
<text>A New Day... Live in Las Vegas is the first predominantly English-language live album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music on 14 June 2004. It includes songs from Dion&#x27;s Las Vegas residency show, &quot;A New Day...&quot; The album also features studio recordings of two new tracks: &quot;You and I&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Look the Other Way&quot;. &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; reached top ten in Canada, the United States, France, Belgium and Greece, and was certified Gold in the United States and Greece and Silver in the United Kingdom.

==Content==
&quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; features thirteen live tracks from Dion&#x27;s successful Las Vegas show, called &quot;A New Day...&quot; and two previously unreleased studio tracks: &quot;You and I&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Look the Other Way&quot;. It was also released with a bonus DVD containing 45-min documentary, called &quot;One Year... One Heart&quot;.

&quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; includes five live songs which weren&#x27;t available on Dion&#x27;s previous albums: &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the World on a String&quot;, &quot;I Wish&quot;, &quot;If I Could&quot; and &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;. The studio versions of last two songs were included on her next album &quot;Miracle&quot;.

&quot;If I Could&quot; was originally recorded by Nancy Wilson on her &quot;Nancy Now!&quot; album in 1988. In 1993 Ray Charles covered it on &quot;My World&quot;, as well as Regina Belle on her album &quot;Passion&quot;. Barbra Streisand included the song on her &quot;Higher Ground&quot; album in 1997.

The French edition of &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; contains &quot;Contre nature&quot; as a bonus track.

The originally scheduled &quot;Live in Las Vegas - A New Day...&quot; DVD release date (autumn 2004) was postponed because of changes and improvements made to the show since the initial filming. &quot;A New Day...&quot; was re-shot in high-definition during the 17–21 January 2007 week and released on 7 December 2007. The two disc DVD contains more than 5 hours of never-before seen footage, including the concert and three exclusive documentaries. Live performances of &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, &quot;At Last&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Et je t&#x27;aime encore&quot; and &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; are available only on &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; CD, as they were removed from the show at the time of filming the DVD.

==Critical reception==

The album met with positive reviews. AllMusic said that &quot;this live document of the Las Vegas show drives home the point that Celine is one of the most potent entertainers in adult contemporary music&quot;. According to them Dion is &quot;equally as comfortable in high-tempo numbers chock-full of her signature vocal acrobatics as she is in quiet, contemplative moments. It&#x27;s an ideal souvenir for those who have experienced the magic with their own ears and eyes. And while it&#x27;s not the most definitive document of Dion&#x27;s career, it certainly is a stirring testament to her accomplishments as the standard to whom most vocalists aspire&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; has sold 530,000 copies in the United States and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was also certified Silver in the UK. The album reached top ten in many countries, including number one in Greece and Quebec, number two in Canada, number four in Belgium Wallonia, number seven in Belgium Flanders, number nine in France, and number ten in the United States.

==Accolades==

In 2005, &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; was nominated for the Félix Award in category Anglophone Album of the Year.

==Track listing==
&quot;You and I&quot; was produced by Aldo Nova and Peer Åström, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Look the Other Way&quot; by Anders Bagge, Åström and Vito Luprano, and &quot;Contre nature&quot; by Erick Benzi.

<doc id="827477" wikidata="Q6342989" url="?curid=827477" title="K Street (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>K Street is a major thoroughfare in the United States capital of Washington, D.C., known as a center for lobbying and the location of numerous advocacy groups, law firms, trade associations, and think tanks. In political discourse, &quot;K Street&quot; has become a metonym for lobbying in the United States, the same way Wall Street in New York City became a metonym for the U.S. financial markets, since many lobbying firms are or traditionally were located on the section in Northwest Washington which passes from Georgetown through a portion of Downtown Washington, D.C.

==Location==
In the Washington D.C. street grid there are three unconnected east-to-west street segments designated as K Street NW / NE, and also a southern K Street.

The middle segment of K Street NW / NE, which carries a segment of U.S. Route 29, begins in the city&#x27;s Northwest quadrant as K Street NW, just west of the abutment of the old Aqueduct Bridge on the Georgetown waterfront. The street travels east underneath the Whitehurst Freeway, crosses Rock Creek on the K Street Bridge, and continues through downtown D.C. After its intersection with North Capitol Street, the street&#x27;s designation changes to K Street NE as it enters the Northeast quadrant. The street ends at Florida Avenue in the Near Northeast neighborhood, just south of Gallaudet University.

K Street NE briefly reappears further east in the Carver neighborhood, extending from Bladensburg Road for six blocks to Maryland Avenue NE.

The westernmost (Georgetown) segment of K street NW was known as Water Street prior to the Georgetown street renaming of 1895. West of 33rd Street NW, the United States Postal Service still recognizes both &quot;K Street&quot; and &quot;Water Street&quot; in addresses. The westernmost end of K Street occupies the former right of way of the Georgetown Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. When that line was abandoned, K Street was extended west to the Washington Canoe Club. The rest of the Georgetown right of way is now occupied by the Capital Crescent Trail, which begins at the terminus of K Street.

The southern K Street runs between the Potomac and Anacostia rivers, crossing the Southwest and Southeast quadrants (as K Street SW and K Street SE, respectively).

==Traffic configuration==

===Current===

K Street provides a major east–west thoroughfare for traffic through Washington, primarily from Mount Vernon Square to the Whitehurst Freeway. The street continues through Georgetown under the Whitehurst Freeway; however most westbound traffic exits to the freeway. A portion of the street travels in a tunnel underneath Washington Circle, allowing through traffic to avoid the circle. Portions of the street are divided into both &quot;local&quot; (or service) lanes and &quot;express&quot; lanes in both directions.

===Proposed===
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has been studying the conversion of K Street into part of a proposed busway. The route would begin at Georgetown University, cross downtown Washington on K Street, switch to Massachusetts Avenue at Mount Vernon Square, and end at Washington Union Station. The DC Circulator provides service along most of the proposed route, although it must share the right of way with other vehicles.

A streetcar line spanning from 26th Street NW to the H Street line&#x27;s terminus at Union Station is planned as the next phase of DC&#x27;s streetcar expansion.

A proposal announced on April 7, 2022, would redesign K Street between 12th and 21st Streets, N.W. The proposal would remove the service lanes in favor of dedicated bus and bicycle lanes. Under the proposal, construction would begin in the spring of 2023.

==Lobbying==
&quot;K Street&quot; is the common metonym for Washington, D.C.&#x27;s lobbying industry, often used negatively in political campaign advertisements, the same way Wall Street in New York City became a metonym for the U.S. financial markets. Many of the major D.C.-based lobbying firms were located on the section in Northwest Washington which passes from Georgetown through a portion of downtown D.C., although the strip has grown less popular for lobbyists in recent years.

Since the late 1980s, many of the largest lobbying firms have moved off of K Street into larger spaces on adjacent streets; , only one of the top-20 largest lobbying firms has a K Street address. The major lobbying firms that physically remain on K Street, as of 2017, include CGCN Group and K&amp;L Gates; although smaller and midsized lobbying and advocacy groups as well as law firms, trade associations, some think tanks, and members of the public affairs industry who commonly interact with each other still occupy spaces on K Street and adjacent areas of Downtown Washington, D.C.

The 2003 HBO television series &quot;K Street&quot; about a lobbying firm takes its name and location from the street.

<doc id="827478" wikidata="Q3547424" url="?curid=827478" title="USS Montezuma (1798)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Montezuma&quot; was a merchant ship built in Virginia in 1795. The United States Navy acquired her during the Quasi-War with France and retained her name.

The Navy purchased &quot;Montezuma&quot; on 26 June 1798 from William Taylor at Baltimore, Maryland to be converted for military action against French naval vessels and privateers attacking American merchantmen during the Quasi-War. She officially entered service in August 1798, with Capt. Alexander Murray in command.

Departing Baltimore on 3 November, &quot;Montezuma&quot; sailed as flagship of a squadron consisting of brig , cutter , and schooner for the West Indies. The squadron was to cruise off Guadeloupe and Martinique to protect American merchantmen and search for French men-of-war. The ships encountered French vessels on 20 November and gave chase, capturing without a fight the brig &quot;Fair American&quot;, an American ship taken by French privateers only five days previously, but subsequently losing &quot;Retaliation&quot; to an attack by two French frigates. After a long chase the squadron was able to evade the French warships and then put into St. Thomas. &quot;Montezuma&quot; continued on her duty in the West Indies, convoying merchant ships to various Caribbean ports into 1799 and then on 7 March fell in with and captured French brig &quot;Les Amis&quot;, 16 guns, off Curaçao. &quot;Montezuma&quot; was ordered home in mid-March and arrived in Philadelphia on 12 May 1799 after convoying 57 merchant ships to various ports on the eastern seaboard.

&quot;Montezuma&quot; sailed on her second voyage to the West Indies on 28 May after Murray transferred his command to Lt. John Mullowny. This time she was bound for St. Kitts in the Leeward Islands, completing various escort duties before sailing to Jamaica to transport a large sum of prize money to Philadelphia, docking at Fort Mifflin on 31 July. &quot;Montezuma&quot; departed Fort Mifflin on 4 August for her third and final tour of duty with the Navy. She sailed to St. Kitts to pick up French prisoners for extradition to Baltimore. Arriving on 28 August, &quot;Montezuma&quot;&#x27;s officers made a decision, based on the ship&#x27;s cramped conditions, to take only 50 prisoners. Departing on 30 August to return to Baltimore, the ship arrived on 14 September. The crew, whose enlistment period was ending, was discharged from service and her officers placed on furlough.

A later inspection of &quot;Montezuma&quot; determined that the ship was too far along in deterioration to maintain her seakeeping ability as a warship; her guns and munitions were removed and the ship was laid up in port. In a letter dated 17 July, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert stated that her gun deck was so low that in a good wind her guns were useless and she would be reduced to dependence on musketry if attacked. Following much deliberation, &quot;Montezuma&quot; was finally sold back to her original owner, William Taylor of Baltimore, on 30 December 1799. Re-equipped for merchant service, she sailed the Atlantic on the Baltimore-Liverpool trade route until disposed of some years before the beginning of the War of 1812.
