<text>John Henry Michael &quot;Rove&quot; McManus (born 21 January 1974) is an Australian triple Gold Logie award-winning comedian, television and radio presenter, producer and media personality. He was the host of the eponymous variety show &quot;Rove&quot; and was also the host of the comedy talk show &quot;Rove LA&quot;. He is the co-owner of the production company Roving Enterprises with business partner Craig Campbell. He hosts &quot;Whovians&quot; on the ABC.

==Early life==
McManus was born in Perth, Western Australia, to John and Coralie McManus. McManus attended Orana Catholic Primary School before going through grades 8–12 at Corpus Christi College. He acquired the nickname &quot;Rove&quot; as a child, from his sister.

==Performing career==
===Live comedy===

McManus is a long established exponent of stand-up comedy, touring nationally and also appearing internationally at major events such as the 2010 Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal and as the host of the 2013 International Comedy Gala.

In 2005 and 2008, McManus undertook live stand-up comedy shows, touring Australian capital cities as well as Wellington and Auckland in New Zealand. During the tour he returned to Melbourne each Tuesday to film &quot;Rove Live&quot;.

===Television===
McManus has appeared on &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot;, &quot;John Safran vs God&quot;, &quot;Pulp Sport&quot;, &quot;The Living Room&quot;, &quot;The Project&quot;, &quot;Studio 10&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot;, &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention New Zealand?&quot; and &quot;Hughesy, We Have a Problem&quot;.

McManus&#x27;s first recorded television appearance was as a child, when he appeared in the ABC television series, &quot;Kaboodle&quot; as Marty, in an episode called &quot;Marty Makes A Move&quot;.

After some time as a jack-of-all-trades helping to produce &quot;Li&#x27;l Elvis and the Truckstoppers&quot;, McManus voiced a role in the 1997 &quot;Monkey See, Monkey Do&quot; episode of &quot;Li&#x27;l Elvis&quot;. In 1997, McManus began hosting &quot;The Loft Live&quot;, which was produced by RMIT University&#x27;s Student television station RMITV for the community television station Channel 31, where, according to Rove, he was given a budget of $50 per week. It was there where he met long-time co-host Peter Helliar. Rove then worked for Foxtel as a roving reporter on a show called &quot;In Fashion&quot; which was hosted by Hugh Jackman. He then took an offer from the Nine Network for ten late-night episodes of his own variety show, &quot;Rove&quot;, in 1999, but Nine cancelled the series at the end of its run. In 2000, McManus was offered the opportunity to produce a new version of the &quot;Rove&quot; show for Network Ten. The resulting &quot;Rove Live&quot; was almost identical to Nine&#x27;s &quot;Rove&quot;. &quot;Rove Live&quot; became a flagship show for Network Ten, and it was also broadcast on TV3 in New Zealand. The show followed a variety show format and showcased weekly celebrity guests; comedy acts; variety segments; local and international comedians; and live bands.

During the 2004 and 2007 federal elections, McManus unsuccessfully campaigned to have the Australian prime minister, John Howard, appear on his program. While Howard did not appear, then-opposition leaders Mark Latham appeared on the show in 2005 and Kevin Rudd in 2007. After being elected prime minister, Rudd appeared on the show again in 2008 and also on 28 June 2009.

When Bert Newton fell ill in early 2004, McManus was one of many guest presenters who hosted Newton&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; program. McManus hosted the episodes on 24 April and 12 October 2004. The following year, McManus and Newton co-hosted a Roving Enterprises television special &quot;Ten Seriously 40&quot;, a look at the history of the Ten Network.

In 2004, McManus appeared in comedian John Safran&#x27;s TV show &quot;John Safran vs God&quot; in a segment in which Safran convinced the controversial UK Muslim cleric Omar Bakri Muhammad to put a fatwa on McManus. The fatwa was later taken off when Omar Bakri found out that the pictures showing McManus mocking Islam were falsified.

In 2005, McManus co-hosted the historic tri-network tsunami appeal Reach Out with fellow presenters Eddie McGuire and Andrew O&#x27;Keefe on three commercial networks Seven, Nine and Ten. The appeal raised over $20 million for tsunami relief efforts around Asia. The event was such a success that the three teamed up just a few months later to host the Logie awards.

In November 2006, after his wife Belinda Emmett died after fighting breast cancer for eight years, McManus took indefinite leave, and &quot;Rove Live&quot; did not screen its last two planned episodes of the year. At the time, there were unfounded rumours circulating in the industry that he might quit television for good. He returned, however, in the competitive Sunday 8.30 pm timeslot on 1 April 2007 with a major format overhaul, including renaming the show to simply &quot;Rove&quot;. &quot;Rove&quot; scored its highest ever audience of 1.69 million viewers. In September 2007, McManus made his debut as a game show host in the Australian version of the US game show &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot;.

On 2 May 2007, 25 July 2007, and 29 October 2008, McManus appeared as a guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and as a result had a regular spot on the show. In 2011 he hosted a segment called &quot;Rove Across America&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Jay Leno and Ed McMahon also made a small pre-recorded appearance at the beginning of McManus&#x27; shows in Los Angeles giving him tips for the night&#x27;s show.

On 23 December 2008, McManus made his debut as host on American television as the host of an American Broadcasting Company special &quot;The List&quot;.

On the 2009 series finale of &quot;Rove&quot; shown on 15 November, following several weeks of rumours that the show was going to end, McManus confirmed live on the show that it would be ending with the 2009 finale. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s purely my decision. It&#x27;s not one I&#x27;ve made lightly or flippantly. The timing was right to stop, stand back and see what happens next.&quot;

In May 2011, McManus relocated to Los Angeles, California, and landed a hosting role on a new talk show, &quot;Rove LA&quot;. The show debuted on 19 September 2011, on FOX8, with catch-up airings on The Comedy Channel. The show was subsequently picked up for a two-year run.

In 2013, McManus featured as a subject in the Australian version of the series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;.

McManus has also appeared as a &#x27;Round table&#x27; guest on the E! Network late-night talk show &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;. He has also made intermittent appearances on TV3&#x27;s satirical &quot;Pulp Sport&quot; series, usually performing menial tasks for the hosts, &quot;Bill and Ben&quot;.

In 2014, McManus hosted &quot;Riot&quot;, the US version of the French light entertainment improv show &quot;Vendredi Tout est Permis&quot; (Friday Anything Goes). In the show, two teams compete on a floor tilted at a 22.5-degree angle. It screened on FOX for one season, and the executive producer was Steve Carell.

On 1 May 2014, McManus appeared on the American comedy show &quot;@midnight&quot;, presented by Chris Hardwick on Comedy Central. He emerged as the winner, being declared by Hardwick as having won the Internet and being the funniest person in the world for the next 23 and a half hours.

In April 2015, the Game Show Network in the United States debuted a new show hosted by McManus called &quot;Lie Detectors&quot;, in which audience members decide which of three comedians is telling the truth.

In 2017, McManus presented the new Australian Broadcasting Corporation panel show, &quot;Whovians&quot;, to tie in with their broadcast of the tenth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; the show aired on ABC TV Plus. The second season began on 8 October 2018 on ABC TV Plus as a companion to the first episode of the eleventh series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and there was no &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series in 2019 so the third series began on 9 February 2020 to tie in with the twelfth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

In 2018, McManus returned to Network Ten to host a new panel show, &quot;Show Me the Movie!&quot;. He also voiced King Tubby, Cheeta, and Last Chance in the kids TV series, &quot;Kitty Is Not a Cat&quot;.

In 2018, McManus was given the greenlight for a new show, &quot;Bring Back...Saturday Night&quot;, after airing a pilot during Network Ten&#x27;s pilot week. The series premiered on 24 August 2019 under new title, &quot;Saturday Night Rove&quot;. It lasted two episodes before getting axed, after viewership dropped from 244,000 to 138,000, below the 200,000 viewers cutoff that was set by the network.

In 2024, McManus guest starred in the &quot;Bluey&quot; episode &quot;The Sign&quot;, voicing a Toy Fox Terrier real estate agent named Bucky Dunstan.

===Radio===
In 1999, McManus was a regular host on Triple J radio and had a segment on the breakfast show (starring Wil Anderson and Adam Spencer) on Friday mornings, &quot;Know Your Millennium&quot;, a quiz show that looked into the past.

In 2000, he filled in on Triple M Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Denton Breakfast Show&quot; with co-host Amanda Keller and Mike Fitzpatrick.

In 2002, Austereo commissioned Roving Enterprises to create a weekly radio program starring McManus alongside regular &quot;Rove&quot; colleagues Peter Helliar and Corinne Grant; the show was originally called &quot;Saturday Morning Rove&quot; and was broadcast on Fox FM every Saturday from 10 am to midday; it was pre-recorded the day before to allow the performers to have a full weekend of other media commitments. In 2004, the program moved to Friday mornings, allowing live phone callers, and was retitled as &quot;Rove Live Radio&quot;; it was discontinued at the end of 2004.

In 2006, McManus and Helliar filled in for &quot;Merrick &amp; Rosso&quot; while they were on holiday. In the first week of their three-week stint, Meshel Laurie of Nova 106.9 co-hosted the show as well.

In October 2015, Southern Cross Austereo announced that McManus and Sam Frost would host breakfast on 2Day FM with the show titled &quot;Rove and Sam&quot;, replacing the ailing &quot;The Dan &amp; Maz Show&quot;. McManus was on a three-year contract beginning from the start of 2016, which included remuneration of shares valued at $350,000 every six months.

===Movie work===
McManus had a cameo voicing a crab in Pixar&#x27;s 2003 animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. He appeared as himself on the New Zealand cartoon &quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; and voices a number of characters in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Exchange Student Zero&quot;.

McManus voiced additional characters in &quot;Norm of the North&quot;.

In 2014, McManus worked on the film &quot;Cookies From Outer Space&quot; with Yahoo Serious.

==Roving Enterprises==
In 2000, McManus started the production company, Roving Enterprises and co-owns it with business partner Craig Campbell. The company co-produced &quot;Rove Live&quot; and produced the AFL football comedy panel program &quot;Before The Game&quot; during their runs on Network Ten. It also produces &quot;The Project&quot;. Past projects include the sketch comedy program &quot;skitHOUSE&quot;, the parody show &quot;Real Stories&quot;, &quot;Rove LA&quot; and, between 2000 and 2004, host and producer of the ARIA Music Awards.

==Awards and nominations==
McManus is a triple TV Week Gold Logie winner for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television, winning in 2003, 2004 and 2005.

In all he has won 16 Logie Awards and been nominated for several others for his work on &quot;Rove&quot; and &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot;. In 2000 McManus was nominated for &#x27;Most Popular New Talent – Male&#x27;. In 2002 he was nominated for the Gold Logie Award. In 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, he was nominated for the Gold Logie. In 2010, McManus was nominated for the Most Popular TV Presenter and for the Gold Logie.
==Charity and community work==
Between 2008 and 2010, McManus was a director of the Australian chapter of the conservation charity Fauna &amp; Flora International, for a period serving as the vice-president.

==Personal life==

McManus married actress and singer Belinda Emmett in 2005 at the Mary Immaculate Church in Waverley, an eastern suburb of Sydney. Emmett died of metastatic breast cancer on 11 November 2006 at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Sydney.

McManus began dating actress Tasma Walton in October 2007. They married on 16 June 2009 in a private ceremony on a beach in Broome, Western Australia. They have a daughter, born in 2013.

He is a supporter of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League, for which his first cousin Shaun McManus played 228 games. For three seasons, starting from 2003, McManus was the number-one ticket holder of the club (a prestigious but largely symbolic position often given to prominent Australians). McManus is also a lifelong fan of professional wrestling; he interviewed wrestlers Ric Flair and John Cena on his talk show, and has managed wrestlers as part of the former World Wrestling All-Stars promotion.

On 8 June 2007, he appeared as the presenter of a secondary school discussion at Rod Laver Arena with Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, in attendance.

<doc id="796650" wikidata="Q7428626" url="?curid=796650" title="Sawfiler">
<text>A saw filer is a person who maintains and repairs saws in a saw mill. A saw filer&#x27;s work area in the mill is called the filing room.

Saws used in timber mills are very large. They need maintenance for safe operation. Repair of damaged saws requires a degree of skill.

Automated equipment has continued to be developed and implemented to improve saw repair quality, with the end goal of operational uptime and productivity.

== Bandsaw filing ==
Bandsaws in timber mills range in size from about (4&quot; x 22ga x 10&#x27;) to (16&quot; x 11ga x 62&#x27;) and can use any of the three main different saw band types: 
*Single-cut saws have, as the name implies, teeth on one side, allowing for cutting in one direction only.
*Double-cut saws have teeth on both sides. These types are designed for machinery that allows the log or work piece to be cut from either the front or the back direction of travel. 
*&quot;Sliver tooth&quot; saws have teeth on both sides but they have different profiles. The (usual) front side have teeth with a regular style tooth. The back of these saws have a longer style. The log is cut in a forward direction as with a single-cut but as the log returns, the saw de-burrs the &quot;cut&quot; (path where the saw passes) allowing for a cleaner finish. They are run for 4 to 24 hours then sent to the saw filer for maintenance.

The saw filer inspects the saw for needed repairs then gums, fits and benches the saw as necessary. 

Gumming involves grinding the gullets of the saw teeth to a particular shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic grinding machine for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and in the presence of wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents case hardening and fatigue cracking of the saw band gullets. Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.

A precise profile of the tooth (including gullet area, hook angle and top clearance angle) must be maintained for proper saw operation and wood chip removal. Ease of cutting greatly depends on this. The shape is determined by the type of wood and cutting conditions. A saw filer will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include face angle, face length, back angle, gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4&quot; tooth space x 3/4&quot; gullet depth x 3/4&quot; gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg face angle x 16deg back angle.

Fitting means tooth dressing and involves swaging, shaping, gauging, and grinding. The tip of the saw tooth is swaged to a flare, then the sides are compressed in slightly with a shaper tool to an exact . Then a final grinding pass is made. The usual gauged tolerance is +/- .005&quot; in kerf, and &lt; .003&quot; side to side variation. The same grinding machinery used for gumming is used for fitting.

The saw kerf is usually made this way from the base saw metal. Sometimes, however, the kerf is made with stellite or carbide tips, in which case swaging and shaping isn&#x27;t needed, although gumming is still required. The kerf may also be &#x27;set&#x27; with a punch and hammer, with the teeth bent left, right, left... Set teeth are rarely used.

Benching is the leveling and tensioning of the saw. When a saw band is run on a mill it is stretched with force, and during operation the cutting edge heats up. These forces and temperatures could cause the saw to deform. Benching deforms an un-mounted saw in a way that counteracts the operating stresses.

Benching is done in a dark room with a stretcher-roller machine and flat anvil. A single light at the benchman’s work station, along with ground gauges, allows the saw filer to measure level and tension. 

Leveling is done with a crossface hammer and stretcher-roller adjustments. Cross face hammers are available in left and right hand versions. Each filer has his own hammer which he carefully dresses.

Tensioning is done with the stretcher-roll. This machine has hardened rollers above and below the saw. They rotate slowly (one is powered, while one runs free) and pinch the saw when a lever is cranked, rolling a thin strip through the length of the saw, stretching the metal where it was rolled. Careful placement and force of the rolls deform the metal in a way that counteracts the forces the saw sees during operation. More rolls are placed in the midsection of the saw. Resaws have the back pulled to counteract the uneven heating of the cutting edge. This is done by rolling the back (non cutting edge) of the saw. The back is measured with a three pin gauge, and is usually around .003&quot; per three feet curved.

Other bandsaw duties include welding broken teeth, fixing cracks, and trouble shooting lumber defects.

CNC equipment has evolved to the point of being able to do significant benching and fitting tasks without human monitoring. 

Most of the above terms are North American and are called different things in Australia, New Zealand as well as elsewhere in the world. 
A saw filer does both the tasks of the benchman and filer at the same time, with no distinction between the tasks as well as having to do circular saws and bandsaws.
This like filing rooms are called Saw Shops in Australia. Most Saw Mills in Australia and New Zealand run a stellite tipped bandsaw in which the majority of what is stated above becomes redundant as it is specifically for sharpening and making the swaged tipped saws.

==Circular saw benching==
Saw filers have the same maintenance duties with circular saws as they do with band saws, with a few exceptions;
*leveling is done mostly with specialized hammers of which there are 3 main types Dog head (side on profile resembles a dogs snout), twist face (A double sided hammer in which the faces are in a 45 degree alignment) and cross face ( faces are at 90 degrees to one another) and anvils (there are 2 main type of anvils dead (for levelling the saw) and live(for both leveling and tensioning the saw), although stretcher-roller machines are also used for leveling and tensioning. 
*Circular saws can be solid tooth (straight saw steel which are bent to give clearance of the saw blade) or can have carbide, Stellite or insert teeth that don&#x27;t need swaging.
*Fatigue cracking of the tooth gullet is not as common as in band saws.

<text>In the physical sciences, a partition coefficient (P) or distribution coefficient (D) is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium. This ratio is therefore a comparison of the solubilities of the solute in these two liquids. The partition coefficient generally refers to the concentration ratio of un-ionized species of compound, whereas the distribution coefficient refers to the concentration ratio of all species of the compound (ionized plus un-ionized).

In the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences, both phases usually are solvents. Most commonly, one of the solvents is water, while the second is hydrophobic, such as 1-octanol. Hence the partition coefficient measures how hydrophilic (&quot;water-loving&quot;) or hydrophobic (&quot;water-fearing&quot;) a chemical substance is. Partition coefficients are useful in estimating the distribution of drugs within the body. Hydrophobic drugs with high octanol-water partition coefficients are mainly distributed to hydrophobic areas such as lipid bilayers of cells. Conversely, hydrophilic drugs (low octanol/water partition coefficients) are found primarily in aqueous regions such as blood serum.

If one of the solvents is a gas and the other a liquid, a gas/liquid partition coefficient can be determined. For example, the blood/gas partition coefficient of a general anesthetic measures how easily the anesthetic passes from gas to blood. Partition coefficients can also be defined when one of the phases is solid, for instance, when one phase is a molten metal and the second is a solid metal, or when both phases are solids. The partitioning of a substance into a solid results in a solid solution.

Partition coefficients can be measured experimentally in various ways (by shake-flask, HPLC, etc.) or estimated by calculation based on a variety of methods (fragment-based, atom-based, etc.).

If a substance is present as several chemical species in the partition system due to association or dissociation, each species is assigned its own &quot;K&quot;ow value. A related value, D, does not distinguish between different species, only indicating the concentration ratio of the substance between the two phases.

== Nomenclature ==
Despite formal recommendation to the contrary, the term &quot;partition coefficient&quot; remains the predominantly used term in the scientific literature.
In contrast, the IUPAC recommends that the title term no longer be used, rather, that it be replaced with more specific terms. For example, &quot;partition constant&quot;, defined as

where &quot;K&quot;D is the process equilibrium constant, [A] represents the concentration of solute A being tested, and &quot;org&quot; and &quot;aq&quot; refer to the organic and aqueous phases respectively. The IUPAC further recommends &quot;partition ratio&quot; for cases where transfer activity coefficients can be determined, and &quot;distribution ratio&quot; for the ratio of total analytical concentrations of a solute between phases, regardless of chemical form.

== Partition coefficient and log &quot;P&quot; ==

The partition coefficient, abbreviated P, is defined as a particular ratio of the concentrations of a solute between the two solvents (a biphase of liquid phases), specifically for un-ionized solutes, and the logarithm of the ratio is thus log &quot;P&quot;. When one of the solvents is water and the other is a non-polar solvent, then the log &quot;P&quot; value is a measure of lipophilicity or hydrophobicity. The defined precedent is for the lipophilic and hydrophilic phase types to always be in the numerator and denominator respectively; for example, in a biphasic system of &quot;n&quot;-octanol (hereafter simply &quot;octanol&quot;) and water:

: formula_1

To a first approximation, the non-polar phase in such experiments is usually dominated by the un-ionized form of the solute, which is electrically neutral, though this may not be true for the aqueous phase. To measure the &quot;partition coefficient of ionizable solutes&quot;, the pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted such that the predominant form of the compound in solution is the un-ionized, or its measurement at another pH of interest requires consideration of all species, un-ionized and ionized (see following).

A corresponding partition coefficient for ionizable compounds, abbreviated log &quot;P&quot; &quot;I&quot;, is derived for cases where there are dominant ionized forms of the molecule, such that one must consider partition of all forms, ionized and un-ionized, between the two phases (as well as the interaction of the two equilibria, partition and ionization). &quot;M&quot; is used to indicate the number of ionized forms; for the -th form () the logarithm of the corresponding partition coefficient, formula_2, is defined in the same manner as for the un-ionized form. For instance, for an octanol–water partition, it is

: formula_3

To distinguish between this and the standard, un-ionized, partition coefficient, the un-ionized is often assigned the symbol log &quot;P&quot;0, such that the indexed formula_2 expression for ionized solutes becomes simply an extension of this, into the range of values .

== Distribution coefficient and log &quot;D&quot; ==
The distribution coefficient, log &quot;D, is the ratio of the sum of the concentrations of all forms of the compound (ionized plus un-ionized) in each of the two phases, one essentially always aqueous; as such, it depends on the pH of the aqueous phase, and log &quot;D&quot; = log &quot;P&quot; for non-ionizable compounds at any pH. For measurements of distribution coefficients, the pH of the aqueous phase is buffered to a specific value such that the pH is not significantly perturbed by the introduction of the compound. The value of each log &quot;D is then determined as the logarithm of a ratio—of the sum of the experimentally measured concentrations of the solute&#x27;s various forms in one solvent, to the sum of such concentrations of its forms in the other solvent; it can be expressed as

: formula_5

In the above formula, the superscripts &quot;ionized&quot; each indicate the sum of concentrations of all ionized species in their respective phases. In addition, since log &quot;D&quot; is pH-dependent, the pH at which the log &quot;D&quot; was measured must be specified. In areas such as drug discovery—areas involving partition phenomena in biological systems such as the human body—the log &quot;D&quot; at the physiologic pH = 7.4 is of particular interest.

It is often convenient to express the log &quot;D&quot; in terms of &quot;P&quot;I, defined above (which includes &quot;P&quot;0 as state ), thus covering both un-ionized and ionized species. For example, in octanol–water:

: formula_6

which sums the individual partition coefficients (not their logarithms), and where formula_7 indicates the pH-dependent mole fraction of the -th form (of the solute) in the aqueous phase, and other variables are defined as previously.

== Example partition coefficient data ==
The values for the octanol-water system in the following table are from the Dortmund Data Bank. They are sorted by the partition coefficient, smallest to largest (acetamide being hydrophilic, and 2,2&#x27;,4,4&#x27;,5-pentachlorobiphenyl lipophilic), and are presented with the temperature at which they were measured (which impacts the values).

Values for other compounds may be found in a variety of available reviews and monographs. Critical discussions of the challenges of measurement of log &quot;P&quot; and related computation of its estimated values (see below) appear in several reviews.

== Applications ==
=== Pharmacology ===

A drug&#x27;s distribution coefficient strongly affects how easily the drug can reach its intended target in the body, how strong an effect it will have once it reaches its target, and how long it will remain in the body in an active form. Hence, the log &quot;P&quot; of a molecule is one criterion used in decision-making by medicinal chemists in pre-clinical drug discovery, for example, in the assessment of druglikeness of drug candidates. Likewise, it is used to calculate lipophilic efficiency in evaluating the quality of research compounds, where the efficiency for a compound is defined as its potency, via measured values of pIC50 or pEC50, minus its value of log &quot;P&quot;.

==== Pharmacokinetics ====
In the context of pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, metabolizes, and excretes a drug), the distribution coefficient has a strong influence on ADME properties of the drug. Hence the hydrophobicity of a compound (as measured by its distribution coefficient) is a major determinant of how drug-like it is. More specifically, for a drug to be orally absorbed, it normally must first pass through lipid bilayers in the intestinal epithelium (a process known as transcellular transport). For efficient transport, the drug must be hydrophobic enough to partition into the lipid bilayer, but not so hydrophobic, that once it is in the bilayer, it will not partition out again. Likewise, hydrophobicity plays a major role in determining where drugs are distributed within the body after absorption and, as a consequence, in how rapidly they are metabolized and excreted.

==== Pharmacodynamics ====
In the context of pharmacodynamics (how the drug affects the body), the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force for the binding of drugs to their receptor targets. On the other hand, hydrophobic drugs tend to be more toxic because they, in general, are retained longer, have a wider distribution within the body (e.g., intracellular), are somewhat less selective in their binding to proteins, and finally are often extensively metabolized. In some cases the metabolites may be chemically reactive. Hence it is advisable to make the drug as hydrophilic as possible while it still retains adequate binding affinity to the therapeutic protein target. For cases where a drug reaches its target locations through passive mechanisms (i.e., diffusion through membranes), the ideal distribution coefficient for the drug is typically intermediate in value (neither too lipophilic, nor too hydrophilic); in cases where molecules reach their targets otherwise, no such generalization applies.

=== Environmental science ===
The hydrophobicity of a compound can give scientists an indication of how easily a compound might be taken up in groundwater to pollute waterways, and its toxicity to animals and aquatic life. Partition coefficient can also be used to predict the mobility of radionuclides in groundwater. In the field of hydrogeology, the octanol–water partition coefficient &quot;K&quot;ow is used to predict and model the migration of dissolved hydrophobic organic compounds in soil and groundwater.

=== Agrochemical research ===

Hydrophobic insecticides and herbicides tend to be more active. Hydrophobic agrochemicals in general have longer half-lives and therefore display increased risk of adverse environmental impact.

=== Metallurgy ===
In metallurgy, the partition coefficient is an important factor in determining how different impurities are distributed between molten and solidified metal. It is a critical parameter for purification using zone melting, and determines how effectively an impurity can be removed using directional solidification, described by the Scheil equation.

=== Consumer product development ===
Many other industries take into account distribution coefficients, for example in the formulation of make-up, topical ointments, dyes, hair colors and many other consumer products.

== Measurement ==
A number of methods of measuring distribution coefficients have been developed, including the shake-flask, separating funnel method, reverse-phase HPLC, and pH-metric techniques.

=== Separating-funnel method ===
In this method the solid particles present into the two immiscible liquids can be easily separated by suspending those solid particles directly into these immiscible or somewhat miscible liquids.

=== Shake flask-type ===
The classical and most reliable method of log &quot;P&quot; determination is the &quot;shake-flask method&quot;, which consists of dissolving some of the solute in question in a volume of octanol and water, then measuring the concentration of the solute in each solvent. The most common method of measuring the distribution of the solute is by UV/VIS spectroscopy.

=== HPLC-based ===
A faster method of log &quot;P&quot; determination makes use of high-performance liquid chromatography. The log &quot;P&quot; of a solute can be determined by correlating its retention time with similar compounds with known log &quot;P&quot; values.

An advantage of this method is that it is fast (5–20 minutes per sample). However, since the value of log &quot;P&quot; is determined by linear regression, several compounds with similar structures must have known log &quot;P&quot; values, and extrapolation from one chemical class to another—applying a regression equation derived from one chemical class to a second one—may not be reliable, since each chemical classes will have its characteristic regression parameters.

=== pH-metric ===
The pH-metric set of techniques determine lipophilicity pH profiles directly from a single acid-base titration in a two-phase water–organic-solvent system. Hence, a single experiment can be used to measure the logarithms of the partition coefficient (log &quot;P&quot;) giving the distribution of molecules that are primarily neutral in charge, as well as the distribution coefficient (log &quot;D&quot;) of all forms of the molecule over a pH range, e.g., between 2 and 12. The method does, however, require the separate determination of the pKa value(s) of the substance.

=== Electrochemical ===

Polarized liquid interfaces have been used to examine the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transfer of charged species from one phase to another. Two main methods exist. The first is ITIES, &quot;interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions&quot;. The second is droplet experiments. Here a reaction at a triple interface between a conductive solid, droplets of a redox active liquid phase and an electrolyte solution have been used to determine the energy required to transfer a charged species across the interface.

=== Single-cell approach ===

There are attempts to provide partition coefficients for drugs at a single-cell level. This strategy requires methods for the determination of concentrations in individual cells, i.e., with Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or quantitative Image analysis. Partition coefficient at a single-cell level provides information on cellular uptake mechanism.

== Prediction ==
There are many situations where prediction of partition coefficients prior to experimental measurement is useful. For example, tens of thousands of industrially manufactured chemicals are in common use, but only a small fraction have undergone rigorous toxicological evaluation. Hence there is a need to prioritize the remainder for testing. QSAR equations, which in turn are based on calculated partition coefficients, can be used to provide toxicity estimates. Calculated partition coefficients are also widely used in drug discovery to optimize screening libraries and to predict druglikeness of designed drug candidates before they are synthesized. As discussed in more detail below, estimates of partition coefficients can be made using a variety of methods, including fragment-based, atom-based, and knowledge-based that rely solely on knowledge of the structure of the chemical. Other prediction methods rely on other experimental measurements such as solubility. The methods also differ in accuracy and whether they can be applied to all molecules, or only ones similar to molecules already studied.

===Atom-based===
Standard approaches of this type, using atomic contributions, have been named by those formulating them with a prefix letter: AlogP, XlogP, MlogP, etc. A conventional method for predicting log &quot;P&quot; through this type of method is to parameterize the distribution coefficient contributions of various atoms to the overall molecular partition coefficient, which produces a parametric model. This parametric model can be estimated using constrained least-squares estimation, using a training set of compounds with experimentally measured partition coefficients. In order to get reasonable correlations, the most common elements contained in drugs (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and halogens) are divided into several different atom types depending on the environment of the atom within the molecule. While this method is generally the least accurate, the advantage is that it is the most general, being able to provide at least a rough estimate for a wide variety of molecules.

===Fragment-based===
The most common of these uses a group contribution method and is termed cLogP. It has been shown that the log &quot;P&quot; of a compound can be determined by the sum of its non-overlapping molecular fragments (defined as one or more atoms covalently bound to each other within the molecule). Fragmentary log &quot;P&quot; values have been determined in a statistical method analogous to the atomic methods (least-squares fitting to a training set). In addition, Hammett-type corrections are included to account of electronic and steric effects. This method in general gives better results than atomic-based methods, but cannot be used to predict partition coefficients for molecules containing unusual functional groups for which the method has not yet been parameterized (most likely because of the lack of experimental data for molecules containing such functional groups).

===Knowledge-based===
A typical data-mining-based prediction uses support-vector machines, decision trees, or neural networks. This method is usually very successful for calculating log &quot;P&quot; values when used with compounds that have similar chemical structures and known log &quot;P&quot; values. Molecule mining approaches apply a similarity-matrix-based prediction or an automatic fragmentation scheme into molecular substructures. Furthermore, there exist also approaches using maximum common subgraph searches or molecule kernels.

===Log &quot;D&quot; from log &quot;P&quot; and p&quot;K&quot;a===
For cases where the molecule is un-ionized:
: formula_8

For other cases, estimation of log &quot;D&quot; at a given pH, from log &quot;P&quot; and the known mole fraction of the un-ionized form, formula_9, in the case where partition of ionized forms into non-polar phase can be neglected, can be formulated as
: formula_10

The following approximate expressions are valid only for monoprotic acids and bases:
: formula_11

Further approximations for when the compound is largely ionized:
* for acids with formula_12, formula_13,
* for bases with formula_14, formula_15.

For prediction of p&quot;K&quot;a, which in turn can be used to estimate log &quot;D&quot;, Hammett type equations have frequently been applied.

===Log &quot;P&quot; from log &quot;S&quot;===
If the solubility, &quot;S&quot;, of an organic compound is known or predicted in both water and 1-octanol, then log &quot;P&quot; can be estimated as
: formula_16
There are a variety of approaches to predict solubilities, and so log &quot;S&quot;.

==Octanol-water partition coefficient==
The partition coefficient between &quot;n&quot;-Octanol and water is known as the n&quot;-octanol-water partition coefficient, or &quot;K&quot;ow. It is also frequently referred to by the symbol P, especially in the English literature. It is also known as n&quot;-octanol-water partition ratio.

&quot;K&quot;ow, being a type of partition coefficient, serves as a measure of the relationship between lipophilicity (fat solubility) and hydrophilicity (water solubility) of a substance. The value is greater than one if a substance is more soluble in fat-like solvents such as n-octanol, and less than one if it is more soluble in water.

=== Example values ===
Values for log &quot;K&quot;ow typically range between -3 (very hydrophilic) and +10 (extremely lipophilic/hydrophobic).

The values listed here are sorted by the partition coefficient. Acetamide is hydrophilic, and 2,2′,4,4′,5-Pentachlorobiphenyl is lipophilic.

<text>The Battle of Pollilur (a.k.a. Pullalur), also known as the Battle of Polilore or Battle of Perambakam, took place on 10 September 1780 at Pollilur near Conjeevaram, the city of Kanchipuram in present-day Tamil Nadu state, India, as part of the Second Anglo-Mysore War. It was fought between an army commanded by King Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, and a British East India Company force led by William Baillie. The EIC force suffered a high number of casualties before surrendering. It was the worst loss the East India Company suffered on the subcontinent until Chillianwala. Benoît de Boigne, a French officer in the service of 6th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry, wrote, &quot;There is not in India an example of a similar defeat&quot;.

==Background==

King Tipu prevented Baillie from joining another force, consisting of two companies of European infantry, two batteries of artillery, and five battalions of native infantry from Guntur led by Hector Munro at Conjeevaram, while King Tipu&#x27;s father King Hyder Ali continued the siege at Arcot.

==Battle==

Baillie&#x27;s men, suffering desertions and uncoordinated leadership, formed a defensive square on a patch of high ground, with William Baillie leading a final stand. Cut off from both Conjeevaram and the stronghold of Fort St. George in Madras where a larger EIC force remained encamped, Baillie&#x27;s men were caught in a double envelopment movement, encircled and routed. Of the men under Baillie&#x27;s command, only 50 European officers and 150 men were taken prisoner after the &quot;general massacre&quot;. Baillie was taken to Seringapatam (Srirangapatnam near Mysore in the present-day Karnataka state). Pullalur was also the site of the Battle of Pullalur, where the king of Badami Chalukya, Pulakesin II fought the Pallava king, Mahendravarman I, in the 7th century.

==Aftermath==
Baillie and many of his officers were captured and taken to the Mysore capital at Seringapatam. After British reinforcements from Calcutta arrived, Eyre Coote was able to stabilise the situation and counter-attack.
A second battle was fought a year later in the same area.

==Rockets==
The Mysore rockets used during the battle were much more advanced than the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km range). At Pollilur, Mysore rockets restricted the British vanguard movement, skimming along the surface, lacerating troops, and in one specific instance, shattering an Ensign’s leg. After King Tipu Sultan&#x27;s eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.

<doc id="796657" wikidata="Q1391014" url="?curid=796657" title="Faceted classification">
<text>A faceted classification is a classification scheme used in organizing knowledge into a systematic order. A faceted classification uses semantic categories, either general or subject-specific, that are combined to create the full classification entry. Many library classification systems use a combination of a fixed, enumerative taxonomy of concepts with subordinate facets that further refine the topic.

== Definition ==
There are two primary types of classification used for information organization: enumerative and faceted. An enumerative classification contains a full set of entries for all concepts. A faceted classification system uses a set of semantically cohesive categories that are combined as needed to create an expression of a concept. In this way, the faceted classification is not limited to already defined concepts. While this makes the classification quite flexible, it also makes the resulting expression of topics complex. To the extent possible, facets represent &quot;clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive aspects of a subject. The premise is that any subject or class can be analyzed into its component parts (i.e., its aspects, properties, or characteristics).&quot; Some commonly used general-purpose facets are time, place, and form.

There are few purely faceted classifications; the best known of these is the Colon Classification of Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan, a general knowledge classification for libraries. Some other faceted classifications are specific to special topics, such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the faceted classification of occupational safety and health topics created by D. J. Foskett for the International Labour Organization.

Many library classifications combine the enumerative and faceted classification techniques. The Dewey Decimal Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, and the Universal Decimal Classification all make use of facets at various points in their enumerated classification schedules. The allowed facets vary based on the subject area of the classification. These facets are recorded as tables that represent recurring types of subdivisions within subject areas. There are general facets that can be used wherever appropriate, such as geographic subdivisions of the topic. Other tables are applied only to specific areas of the schedules. Facets can be combined to create a complex subject statement.

Daniel Joudrey and Arlene Taylor describe faceted classification using an analogy: &quot;If one thinks of each of the faces of a cut and polished diamond as a facet of the whole, one can picture a classification notation that has small notations standing for subparts of the whole topic, which are pieced together to create a complete classification notation.&quot;

Faceted classifications exhibit many of the same problems as classifications based on a hierarchy. In particular, some concepts could belong in more than one facet, so their placement in the classification may appear to be arbitrary to the classifier. It also tends to result in a complex notation because each facet must be distinguishable as recorded.

== Retrieval ==
Search in systems with faceted classification can enable a user to navigate information along multiple paths corresponding to different orderings of the facets. This contrasts with traditional taxonomies in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging. It is also possible to use facets to filter search results to more quickly find desired results.

==Examples of faceted classifications==
=== Colon classification for library materials ===
The Colon Classification developed by S. R. Ranganathan is an example of general faceted classification designed to be applied to all library materials. In the Colon Classification system, a book is assigned a set of values from each independent facet. This facet formula uses punctuation marks and symbols placed between the facets to connect them. Colon classification was named after its use of the colon as the primary symbol in its notation.

Ranganathan stated that hierarchical classification schemes like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress Subject Headings are too limiting and finite to use for modern classification and that many items can pertain information to more than one subject. He organized his classification scheme into 42 classes. Each class can be categorized according to particular characteristics, that he called facets. Ranganathan said that there are five fundamental categories that can be used to demonstrate the facets of a subject: personality, material, energy, space and time. He called this the PMEST formula: 
*Personality is the most specific or focal subject.
*Matter is the substance, properties or materials of the subject.
*Energy includes the processes, operations and activities.
*Space relates to the geographic location of the subject.
*Time refers to the dates or seasons of the subject.

=== Universal Decimal Classification ===
Another example of a faceted classification scheme is the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), a complex multilingual classification that can be used in all fields of knowledge.
The Universal Decimal Classification scheme was created at the end of the nineteenth century by Belgian bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri la Fontaine. The goal of their system was to create an index that would be able to record knowledge even if it is stored in non-conventional ways including materials in notebooks and ephemera. They also wanted their index to organize material systematically instead of alphabetically.

The UDC has an overall taxonomy of knowledge that is extended with a number of facets, such as language, form, place and time. Each facet has its own symbol in the notation, such as: &quot;=&quot; for language; &quot;-02&quot; for materials, &quot;[...]&quot; for subordinate concepts.

===Faceted Classification for Occupational Safety and Health===

D. J. Foskett, a member of the Classification Research Group in London, developed classification of occupational safety and health materials for the library of the International Labour Organization. After a study of the literature in the field, he created the classification with the following facets:

*Facet A: Occupational Safety and Health: General
*Facet B: Special Classes of Workers, Industries
*Facet C: Sources of Hazards: Fire, Machinery, etc.
*Facet D: Industrial Accidents and Diseases
*Facet E: Preventive Measures, Protection
*Facet F: Organisation, Administration

Notation was solely alphabetic, with the sub-facets organized hierarchically using extended codes, such as &quot;g Industrial equipment and processes&quot;, &quot;ge Machines&quot;.

===Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)===

While not strictly a classification system, the AAT uses facets similar to those of Ranganathan&#x27;s Colon Classification:

*Associated Concepts (e.g., philosophy)
*Physical Attributes
*Styles and Periods
*Agents (People/Organizations)
*Activities (similar to Ranganathan&#x27;s Energy)
*Materials (similar to Ranganathan&#x27;s Matter)
*Objects (similar to Ranganathan&#x27;s Personality)

==Comparison between faceted and single hierarchical classification==
Hierarchical classification refers to the classification of objects using one &quot;single&quot; hierarchical taxonomy. Faceted classification may actually employ hierarchy in one or more of its facets, but allows for the use of more than one taxonomy to classify objects.

*Faceted classification systems allow the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, and enable those classifications to be applied by searchers in multiple ways, rather than in a single, predetermined order. Multiple facets may be used as a first step in a search process. For example, one may &quot;start&quot; from language or subject.
*Hierarchical classification systems are developed classes that are subdivided from the most general subjects to the most specific.
*Faceted classification systems allow for the combination of facets to filter the set of objects rapidly. In addition, the facets can be used to address multiple classification criteria.
*A faceted system focuses on the important, essential or persistent characteristics of content objects, helping it to be useful for categorization of fine-grained rapidly changing repositories.
*In faceted classification systems one does not have to know the name of the category into which an object is placed a priori. A controlled vocabulary is presented with the number of documents matching each vocabulary term.
*New facets may be created at any time without disruption of a single hierarchy or reorganizing other facets.
*Faceted classification systems make few assumptions about the scope and organization of the domain. It is difficult to &quot;break&quot; a faceted classification schema.

<text>João Batista Mascarenhas de Morais (November 13, 1883 – September 17, 1968) was a Brazilian army officer and commander of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force in the Second World War. He was ranked Field Marshal and was the last active Brazilian marshal.

==Career==
At age 14, living alone in Porto Alegre, working and studying, he was able to enter the Rio Pardo Preparatory and Tactical School, in Rio Grande do Sul. After leaving the course, he entered the Military School of Brazil, Known as Praia Vermelha Military School, in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1904, while still studying the third year, the Vaccine Revolt broke out in the capital. The young Mascarenhas did not participate in the movement against the compulsory vaccine law, but the Praia Vermelha School was closed and the rioters were expelled.

In 1922 there was the election of Artur Bernardes for the presidency, being in second place Nilo Peçanha the candidate supported by Rio de Janeiro. Bernardes had been facing a campaign in the newspapers about false statements made on his behalf, in which alleged letters denigrated the army and former president Hermes da Fonseca. This episode led to the discontent of some military corps, dissatisfied with the result of the election and with the previous government of Epitacio Pessoa, which eventually originated the movement known as the Revolt of the 18 of the Copacabana Fort. At that time, Mascarenhas was Captain and commanded the 1st Artillery Regiment. The revolt had taken beyond the Fort Copacabana the Military School of Realengo and some focuses in Vila Militar. Mascarenhas supported the legalistic forces, giving support to the Infantry. While not counting on his detained officers, Mascarenhas replaced them with more experienced sergeants and fulfilled his mission.

In 1930, during the 1930 Revolution Mascarenhas remained loyal to President Washington Luiz and was arrested by the rebels headed by Getúlio Vargas, who became president himself in that same year after ousting Washington Luiz. After release, Mascarenhas continued his career in the army

In 1935, while serving as Commander of the Military School of Realengo, Mascarenhas de Morais took part in the fight against a communist uprising in Rio de Janeiro. This time, his loyalty was with the constitutional government of Getulio Vargas. In 1937 he became a General and was, in the following years, commander of the 9th and 7th and military regions in Recife and São Paulo respectively.

In 1943 he was named commander of the First Expeditionary Infantry Division of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, the 1st DIE (in Portuguese, &quot;Primeira Divisão de Infantaria Expedicionária&quot;). With the cancellation of the 2nd and 3rd Divisions he thus became commander of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, comprising only the 1st DIE. During the organization of the 1st DIE he was also head of the Brazil Military Commission with the US and visited the Mediterranean Theater of operations in 1943, before the arrival of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force.

Mascarenhas arrived in Italy with the first Brazilian troops in June 1944 and commanded the Brazilian forces until the surrender of the Axis forces in Italy, on May 2, 1945.
Following the Battle of Collecchio (26–27 April 1945) and a sharp action at Fornovo di Taro, Mascarenhas de Moraes received the surrender of the German 148th Division and the Italian Monte Rosa, San Marco and Italia Divisions on 29–30 April 1945. In one week the Brazilians had taken 14,700 troops, 800 officers and two generals.
After the end of the war he returned to Brazil and, in 1946, was made a marshal by the Brazilian Congress and received the command of the 1st Military Region in the then Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro.

After a short retirement Mascarenhas returned to active duty in 1951 as Chief of Staff of the Brazilian Armed Forces during the second Vargas government (1951–1954). After the President&#x27;s suicide, in August 1954, he returned to retirement and wrote his memoirs of his time as commander of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. A federal special law was approved by the National Congress declaring him in army&#x27;s active service for life, with all responsibilities and privileges, with the rank of field marshal. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1968.

==Personal life==
His great-nephew is the Brazilian opera singer Claudio Mascarenhas.

<doc id="796676" wikidata="Q1764445" url="?curid=796676" title="A Feast for Crows">
<text>A Feast for Crows is the fourth of seven planned novels in the epic fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by American author George R. R. Martin. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom on October 17, 2005, with a United States edition following on November 8, 2005.

Because of its size, Martin and his publishers split the narrative of the still-unfinished manuscript for &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; into two books. Rather than divide the text chronologically in half, Martin instead split the material by plot location, resulting in &quot;two novels taking place simultaneously&quot; with different casts of characters. &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; was published months later, focusing mainly on southern Westeros. The concurrent novel &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, which focuses on other locations such as the North, the Wall, and Essos, was advertised for the following year but was eventually released six years later in 2011. Martin noted that the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series would now likely total seven novels.

&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; was the first novel in the series to debut at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, a feat among fantasy writers only previously achieved by Robert Jordan and Neil Gaiman. In 2006, the novel was nominated for the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, and the British Fantasy Award. It has since been adapted, along with &quot;A Dance With Dragons&quot;, for television as the fifth season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, though elements of the novel appeared in the series&#x27; fourth and sixth seasons.

== Plot summary ==
The War of the Five Kings is slowly coming to its end. The secessionist kings Robb Stark and Balon Greyjoy are dead. One claimant to the throne, Stannis Baratheon, has gone to fight off invading wildling tribes at the northern Wall, where Robb&#x27;s half-brother Jon Snow has become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night&#x27;s Watch, the order responsible for guarding the Wall. The eight-year-old King Tommen Baratheon now rules in King&#x27;s Landing under the regency of his mother, Cersei Lannister. The warrior woman Brienne of Tarth has been sent by Cersei&#x27;s brother (and lover) Jaime Lannister on a mission to find Robb&#x27;s sister Sansa Stark. Sansa is hiding in the Vale, protected by her mother&#x27;s childhood friend Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish, who has murdered his wife (and her aunt) Lysa Arryn, and named himself Protector of the Vale and guardian of Lysa&#x27;s son, the eight-year-old Lord Robert Arryn.

=== Prologue ===
Pate is a young apprentice at the Citadel in Oldtown, training to become a member of the ancient order of scholar-healers known as maesters. At the request of a stranger, he has stolen an important key to a depository of books and records. After turning over the stolen key and receiving the reward of a gold coin, he bites the coin and dies abruptly from poisoning.

=== King&#x27;s Landing ===
Following the death of Tywin Lannister, the late Hand of the King, Queen Cersei&#x27;s regency is marked by rampant cronyism, and her councils are staffed with incompetent officials and unreliable sycophants. She disregards advice from her uncle Kevan and her brother Jaime, alienating them both. Making matters worse is Cersei&#x27;s increasing distrust of the powerful Tyrells, whose alliance is essential to the stability of the Lannister regime — particularly King Tommen&#x27;s fiancée Margaery, whom Cersei believes to be the subject of a prophecy about a &quot;younger, more beautiful queen&quot; who will take away all that Cersei holds dear.

Her reckless management raises the kingdom&#x27;s debts to the Iron Bank of Braavos and the Faith of the Seven. When Cersei defaults the debt owed to the Iron Bank, the Bank&#x27;s financial retaliation nearly cripples the economy of Westeros. To settle the crown&#x27;s debts to the Faith, Cersei permits the restoration of that religion&#x27;s military order, the Faith Militant, ignoring the danger of a re-armed Faith. A scheme to falsely have the Faith put Margaery on trial for adultery backfires when the religious leadership imprisons Cersei herself on similar (correct) charges.

=== Riverlands ===
Cersei dispatches Jaime to the Riverlands to put down the remnants of the late Robb Stark&#x27;s rebellion. He unsuccessfully negotiates with Robb&#x27;s great-uncle Brynden &quot;the Blackfish&quot; Tully to surrender the castle of Riverrun in exchange for his nephew Edmure&#x27;s life, but then convinces Edmure to surrender to save the lives of his men and his unborn child. Though the siege ends bloodlessly, Brynden escapes. Jaime then receives word that Cersei, who has been arrested by the Faith, wants him to defend her in a trial by combat, but Jaime burns her letter and abandons her to her fate.

Brienne&#x27;s quest leads her all over the Riverlands, where she witnesses the devastation caused by the war. She acquires Podrick Payne, the former squire of Jaime&#x27;s brother Tyrion, and Ser Hyle Hunt, a knight who had once mocked her ugliness, as traveling companions. She learns that Sansa&#x27;s sister Arya Stark has actually survived and escaped King&#x27;s Landing, and the feared warrior Sandor Clegane is reportedly dead but someone wearing his helmet has massacred the town of Saltpans. She later kills the culprit Rorge but is gravely injured and mutilated by his companion Biter. Eventually, she is captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners, which was once devoted to protecting the smallfolk of the Riverlands but is now commanded by the magically resurrected Catelyn Stark, Sansa&#x27;s mother. The undead and vengeful Catelyn, who has taken the name Lady Stoneheart, sentences Brienne to death for consorting with the Lannisters, but offers to spare her and her companions if she agrees to kill Jaime.

=== The Vale ===
In the remote castle of the Eyrie, Sansa poses as Littlefinger&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Alayne Stone, befriending the young Lord Robert Arryn, managing the household, and receiving informal training in politics. During this time, Littlefinger appears to be carefully manipulating Robert&#x27;s bannermen to secure his status as Lord Protector of the Vale. He eventually reveals that he plans to betroth Sansa to Harrold Hardyng, the next heir in line to the Vale; when the sickly Robert dies, Littlefinger intends to reveal Sansa&#x27;s identity and claim her family stronghold of Winterfell in her name.

=== Iron Islands ===
On the Iron Islands, the late Balon Greyjoy&#x27;s eldest surviving brother Euron returns from exile to claim the throne. To prevent this, his younger brother Aeron, a priest, calls a Kingsmoot to elect the successor. Although Euron&#x27;s claim is contested by his other younger brother Victarion and Balon&#x27;s daughter Asha, eventually Euron is chosen as king for his promise to conquer Westeros and control Daenerys Targaryen&#x27;s dragons with an enchanted horn he possesses. Under Euron&#x27;s leadership, the Iron Fleet attacks the Reach, threatening House Tyrell&#x27;s seat at Highgarden. Euron sends Victarion east to propose marriage to Daenerys on his behalf, to thus gain a claim to the Iron Throne; but Victarion secretly decides to woo her for himself instead.

=== Dorne ===
In the southern region of Dorne, Prince Doran Martell is confronted by three of the Sand Snakes — his brother Oberyn&#x27;s bastard daughters, who want vengeance for the death of their father. Because they are inciting the commonfolk, Doran has his guard captain Areo Hotah arrest and imprison them in the palace.

A bold attempt by Doran&#x27;s daughter Arianne to create a war of succession by crowning Tommen&#x27;s sister Myrcella as queen of Westeros is thwarted. In the confusion, one of Arianne&#x27;s co-conspirators, Ser Gerold &quot;Darkstar&quot; Dayne, attempts to kill Myrcella and disfigures her face. Myrcella&#x27;s guardian, Ser Arys Oakheart, is killed by Areo Hotah. This strains Dorne&#x27;s new alliance with the Iron Throne. Doran later reveals to his daughter that he has a much grander plan to bring down the Lannisters, and her brother Quentyn has gone east to bring back &quot;Fire and Blood&quot; through an alliance with Daenerys.

=== Braavos ===
Arriving in the foreign city of Braavos, Arya Stark finds her way to the cult of face-changing assassins known as the Faceless Men. Accepted as a novice, Arya is taught to abandon her previous identity, but her true identity asserts itself in the form of wolf dreams.

Meanwhile, the Night&#x27;s Watch lord commander Jon Snow has ordered Samwell Tarly to sail to the Citadel in Oldtown to train as a maester and warn the Seven Kingdoms about the return of the legendary hostile beings known as the Others. Sam is accompanied by the elderly Maester Aemon, the wildling girl Gilly, Gilly&#x27;s newborn baby, and another Night&#x27;s Watch member, Dareon. After the voyage is underway, Sam realizes that the child is actually the son of the wildling leader Mance Rayder, swapped with Gilly&#x27;s real son. The party becomes temporarily stranded in Braavos when Aemon becomes sick, and Dareon absconds with their money. After learning that Daenerys possesses dragons, Aemon concludes that she is destined to fulfill a prophecy, and he needs to go assist her; but shortly after the party finally leaves Braavos, Aemon dies at the age of 102.

After Sam&#x27;s party leaves, Arya chances upon Dareon and murders him for deserting the Night&#x27;s Watch. As punishment for the unauthorized killing, the Faceless Men then feed her a potion that causes blindness.

=== Oldtown ===
At the end of the novel, Sam arrives at the Citadel and is introduced to Archmaester Marwyn. After learning about Aemon&#x27;s death and the dragon prophecy about Daenerys, Marwyn leaves to find Daenerys. Before he leaves, he reveals to Sam that there is a maester conspiracy to suppress magic and that the Citadel orchestrated the downfall of the dragons centuries ago. He warns him not to talk about prophecy or dragons because the maesters will probably poison him. Sam also meets with an acolyte bearing Pate&#x27;s name and appearance.

== Publication ==
Martin released the first four &quot;Iron Islands&quot; chapters of &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; as a novella called &quot;Arms of the Kraken&quot;, published in the 305th edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, published in May 2003. Another chapbook featuring three Daenerys chapters was published for BookExpo 2005 although, following the geographical division of the book, these chapters were subsequently moved into the fifth volume in the series, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;.

Martin originally planned for the fourth book to be called &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; with the story picking up five years after the events of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (primarily to advance the ages of the younger characters). However, during the writing process, it was discovered that this was leading to an overreliance on flashbacks to fill in the gap. After twelve months or so of working on the book, Martin decided to abandon much of what had previously been written and start again, this time picking up immediately after the end of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. He announced this decision, along with the new title &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, at Worldcon in Philadelphia on September 1, 2001. He also announced that &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; would now be the fifth book in the sequence.

In May 2005, Martin announced that his manuscript for &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; had hit 1527 completed pages but still remained unfinished, with &quot;another hundred or so pages of roughs and incomplete chapters, as well as other chapters, sketched out but entirely unwritten.&quot; As the size of the manuscript for &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000), his previous novel, had been a problem for publishers around the world at 1521 pages, Martin and his publishers had decided to split the narrative planned for &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; into two books. Rather than divide the text in half chronologically, Martin opted to instead split the material by character and location:
It was my feeling ... that we were better off telling all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters. Cutting the novel in half would have produced two half-novels; our approach will produce two novels taking place simultaneously, but set hundreds or even thousands of miles apart, and involving different casts of characters (with some overlap).

Martin noted that &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; would focus on &quot;Westeros, King&#x27;s Landing, the riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands,&quot; and that the next novel, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, would cover &quot;events in the east and north.&quot; Martin also added that the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series would now likely total seven novels. &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; was published months later on October 17, 2005, over five years after the previous volume in the series, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. The parallel novel &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; was released on July 12, 2011.

== Reception ==
Though &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; was the first novel in the sequence to debut at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, it received more negative reviews in comparison with the previous novels in the series. Martin&#x27;s decision to halve the plot in terms of character and location was highly controversial; many critics felt that this novel consisted of characters that people were less interested in. In the critic reviews aggregate of Bookmarks March/April 2006 issue, the book received a (4.0 out of 5) with a critical summary saying, &quot;Though the book stands alone, readers will reap greater rewards by starting with the first of the series, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;&quot;. 

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said, &quot;Long-awaited doesn&#x27;t begin to describe this fourth installment in bestseller Martin&#x27;s staggeringly epic Song of Ice and Fire. [...]. This is not Act I Scene 4 but Act II Scene 1, laying groundwork more than advancing the plot, and it sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying.&quot; Salon.com&#x27;s Andrew Leonard said in 2011, &quot;I don&#x27;t care how good a writer you are: If you subtract your three strongest characters from your tale, you severely undermine the basis for why readers fell under your spell in the first place. It didn&#x27;t work. But there was also a sense in &quot;A Feast of Crows&quot; that Martin had lost his way. The characters whose stories he did tell wandered back and forth across a landscape devastated by war and oncoming winter, but didn&#x27;t seem to be headed anywhere in particular.&quot; Remy Verhoeve of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; noted in their 2011 &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; review that the fifth volume had to &quot;repair some of the damage done by &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, which frankly felt as if it was written by a ghost writer at times.&quot; Both books had &quot;the same structural problems&quot;, being &quot;sprawling and incoherent&quot;, and in her opinion &quot;Feast&quot; has the less interesting characters. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; Rachael Brown said in their &quot;A Dance With Dragons&quot; review that &quot;Feast&quot; was &quot;bleak and plodding&quot; and &quot;sorely missed&quot; Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow.

<doc id="796680" wikidata="Q5103074" url="?curid=796680" title="Chlorogalum pomeridianum">
<text>Chlorogalum pomeridianum, the wavy-leafed soap plant, California soaproot, or Amole, is the most common and most widely distributed of the soap plants, soaproots or amoles, which make up the genus &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; of flowering plants. It is occasionally known as the &quot;wild potato&quot;, but given the plant&#x27;s lack of either resemblance or relationship to the potato, this name is not recommended.

It is found in most of California from the coasts to the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, and in the Klamath Mountains in southwestern Oregon, but not in either state&#x27;s desert regions. Wavy-leafed soap plant grows on rock bluffs, grasslands, chaparral, and in open woodlands.

Like all the soap plants, &quot;Chlorogalum pomeridianum&quot; is a perennial that grows from a bulb, which is brown, between 7 and 15 cm in diameter, slightly elongated, and covered in thick, coarse fibers. The leaves grow from the base of the plant, and can be from 20 to 70 cm long and 6 to 25 mm wide. As the plant&#x27;s name indicates, their edges are generally wavy, though this is not always particularly noticeable.

The flowers are borne on a long stem, normally longer than the leaves, and are from 15 to 30 mm long. The six petals (actually only three of them are petals in the technical sense; the other three are sepals) are up to 35 mm long and curving. They are typically white but have a noticeable mid-vein which can be purple or green. The six stamens are large and noticeable, and yellow or orange. The flowers are hermaphrodites (having both female and male parts).

They open only in the late afternoon or evening, remaining open during the night but closing by the morning. Pollination is by evening- or night-flying insects.

===Subspecies===
Three varieties are recognized:
*&quot;Chlorogalum pomeridianum&quot; var. &quot;divaricatum&quot; — endemic to some coastal regions of California (the Central Coast and southern parts of the North Coast), found only at elevations below about .
*&quot;Chlorogalum pomeridianum&quot; var. &quot;minus&quot; — endemic to the inner north and outer south Pacific Coast Ranges of California, and the San Francisco Bay Area. This variety has a less fibrous bulb than the others. On the CNPS&quot;Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California&quot;.
*&quot;Chlorogalum pomeridianum&quot; var. &quot;pomeridianum&quot;, Nomlaki language: shlā — found throughout the range of the species.

The basionym of the species was &quot;Scilla pomeridianum&quot;. It has also been known as &quot;Laothoe pomeridiana&quot;.

==Uses==

The fibers surrounding the bulb were widely used, bound together, to make small brushes. Extracts of the bulbs could also be used as a sealant or glue.
;Cleansing
The juices of the bulb contain saponins that form a lather when mixed with water, and both Native American people (e.g. Miwok tribe) and early European settlers used the bulbs as a kind of soap; this is the origin of the plant&#x27;s name. It was particularly used for washing hair, since it was held to be effective against dandruff.

;Cuisine
The young leaves can be used as food, but the saponins in the bulbs make these poisonous. However saponins are very poorly absorbed by the body and usually pass straight through, and in any case they can be destroyed by thorough cooking. The Miwok people roasted and ate the bulbs as a winter food. In February 1847 Patrick Breen of the ill-fated Donner Party recorded that a Native American gave the starving settler some &quot;roots resembling Onions in shape [that] taste some like a sweet potatoe, all full of little tough fibres.&quot; Breen&#x27;s son later called the roots &quot;California soap-root&quot;—almost certainly &quot;C. pomeridianum&quot;.

Saponins are much more toxic to some other animals than they are to humans. Fish are particularly susceptible, and the bulb juices were used to kill or stun them so they could be caught easily.

;Medicinal
The bulbs also had various medicinal uses, both external (e.g., for making a poultice to be used as an antiseptic, or as a rub in cases of rheumatism) and internal (decoctions were used for a range of purposes, including as a diuretic, as a laxative and against stomachache).

<doc id="796686" wikidata="Q7092544" url="?curid=796686" title="One Country on Each Side">
<text>One Country on Each Side is a concept consolidated in the Democratic Progressive Party government led by Chen Shui-bian, the former president of the Republic of China (2000–2008), regarding the political status of Taiwan. It emphasizes that the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China (or alternatively, Taiwan itself) are two different countries, (namely &quot;One China, one Taiwan&quot;), as opposed to two separate political entities within the same country of &quot;China&quot;. This is the position of the supporters of the Pan-Green coalition.

==History==
In Peng Ming-min’s 1964 , it was stated that “One China, one Taiwan” had been an ironclad fact (「一個中國，一個台灣」早已是鐵一般的事實). The same concept “One China, One Formosa” was presented in Chen Lung-chu and Harold Lasswell’s book-length proposal in 1967 — &quot;Formosa, China and the United Nations: Formosa in the World Community&quot;.

Chen used this phrase in an August 3, 2002, telecast to the annual conference of the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations meeting in Tokyo when he stated that it needs to be clear that &quot;with Taiwan and China on each side of the Taiwan Strait, each side is a country.&quot; His statements were made in Taiwanese Minnan as opposed to Mandarin and drew a barrage of criticism from the mainland Chinese press, which had previously shied away from the types of attacks it gave to Lee Teng-hui, who promoted a similar &quot;&quot;. The United States also expressed serious concerns over this concept, as the U.S. felt that this concept appeared to have departed from Chen&#x27;s earlier pledge of &quot;Four Noes and One Without&quot;. &quot;State-to-state relations&quot; had originally been translated in English as “country-to-country relations” but the Mainland Affairs Council got the translation changed to the less provocative option.

The Taiwan Action Party Alliance, founded on 18 August 2019, incorporated One Country on Each Side into its Chinese-language name.

<doc id="796690" wikidata="Q75629" url="?curid=796690" title="Alfred Frenzel">
<text>Alfred Frenzel (1899–1968) was a West German member of parliament, who was secretly conducting espionage for Czechoslovakia while serving on the Bundestag&#x27;s Defense Committee. Given the code name Anna by the StB, he passed along classified information to the Communist government in Prague for five years, until his arrest in Bonn on October 31, 1960. He was the most important StB spy during the entire Cold War.

During World War II, after the invasion of his homeland by Nazi Germany, Frenzel worked as an agent for the government in exile in the United Kingdom. After the end of the war, Czechoslovakia became a communist state, and Frenzel emigrated to West Germany.

The new state intelligence service in Czechoslovakia, the StB, examined the files of pre-war intelligence officers, and found information on Frenzel&#x27;s pre-war activities. When they discovered that Frenzel had been appointed to the parliamentary defence committee responsible for remilitarising West Germany and establishing her place in NATO, the StB leapt on this opportunity to recruit such a highly placed spy.

==Recruitment==
In April 1956, an old friend of Frenzel&#x27;s visited him in West Germany. He told Frenzel that he was now working for the Czechoslovak government, and offered Frenzel a job. The old friend added that he would expose Frenzel&#x27;s political past and criminal record unless he took up the offer. He also said that Frenzel&#x27;s wife, who was on a trip to Prague, would be in grave danger if he refused. Intimidated, Frenzel agreed to take the job.

He travelled to Vienna, Austria, which was at the time crawling with StB officers due to its proximity to Czechoslovakia, where he was given 1,500 Deutsche Marks and given the code name Anna. In July, he signed a document indicating his links to the StB.

Frenzel was now trapped, and the StB had enough information to blackmail him unless he did exactly as they said.

==Espionage activities==
Under the close watch of his StB controller, Major Bohumil Molnár, Frenzel returned to West Germany. He began to pass information to Molnár, including a copy of the entire West German defence budget and details of prototype American aircraft. 

To reward him for this, the StB gave him a car and a villa back in Czechoslovakia, and also paid Frenzel an enormous salary, placed into a Czechoslovak bank so as not to arouse West German suspicion.

During his time as a spy, the StB&#x27;s Technical Directorate gave Frenzel many new and experimental devices, including a small film-carrying statue, which, by way of a small explosive charge, would destroy its film unless a special mercury switch was deactivated.

Much of the information the StB gathered from Frenzel was passed on to the KGB.

==Downfall==
In September 1959, Frenzel was passed on from Molnar (who was promoted to deputy director of the StB for his work with Frenzel) to a new controller, a man operating under the pseudonym Franz Altman. Altman&#x27;s favourite method of transporting information and film was by way of the containers that would destroy their contents, such as the small statue mentioned before.

These containers would be passed on to Czechoslovak diplomats, who would return the information to Prague. However, in October 1960, the West German counterintelligence organisation, the BfV, became suspicious of Altman, after the tax department reported spending disproportionate to his income.

Altman was arrested just before he boarded a flight to Prague. The arresting BfV agents went through his luggage, and found a talcum powder tin. It was determined to be carrying film, and BfV agents very carefully disassembled it.

Inside was a roll of film, and when the film was developed, photos were found of key West German installations. In the corner of one photo was the number plate of a car. The BfV investigated this, and found that the car belonged to Alfred Frenzel. Along with further evidence, he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison.

He was exchanged for four West German agents five years later.

Frenzel died of natural causes in 1968.

<doc id="796691" wikidata="Q17083791" url="?curid=796691" title="Noise reduction coefficient">
<text>The noise reduction coefficient (commonly abbreviated NRC) is a single number value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 that describes the average sound absorption performance of a material. An NRC of 0.0 indicates the object does not attenuate mid-frequency sounds, but rather reflects sound energy. This is more conceptual than physically achievable: even very thick concrete walls will attenuate sound and may have an NRC of 0.05. Conversely, an NRC of 1.0 indicates that the material provides an acoustic surface area (in units sabin) that is equivalent to its physical, two-dimensional surface area. This rating is common of thicker, porous sound absorptive materials such as fabric-wrapped fiberglass panel. Materials can achieve NRC values greater than 1.00. This is a shortcoming of the test procedure and a limitation of how acousticians define a square unit of absorption, and not a characteristic of the material itself.

Note that NRC should not be confused with Sound Transmission Class rating (STC) which measures how much sound is blocked from going through a product. STC is more relevant to sound proofing, while NRC is more relevant for acoustics and sound quality. 

==Technical definition==
The noise reduction coefficient is &quot;a single-number rating, rounded to the nearest 0.05, of the sound absorption coefficients of a material for the four one-third octave bands at 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz&quot;. The absorption coefficients of materials are commonly determined through use of standardized testing procedures, such as ASTM C423 that is used to evaluate the absorption of materials in eighteen one-third octave frequency bands with center frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 5000 Hz. Absorption coefficients used to calculate NRC are commonly determined in reverberation rooms of qualified acoustical laboratory test facilities using samples of the particular materials of specified size (typically in an configuration) and appropriate mounting.

The NRC is a logarithmic representation of the decay rate (dB/s) due to a panel or object with a defined surface area absorbing energy compared to the decay rate in a standard reverberant room without the panel or object

== History == 
Wallace Clement Sabine was the first scientist to study the sound-absorbing characteristics of materials in a scientifically rigorous manner. Paul Sabine, a distant cousin of Wallace, studied the repeatability of sound absorption coefficient measurements in reverberation chambers. Paul Sabine&#x27;s work in the 1920s–1930s laid the groundwork for the ASTM C423 test methodology still used today.

Prior to the development of a standard procedure for material testing or reverberation chamber construction, data at low frequencies was highly unreliable and differed significantly from manufacturer to manufacturer. This is one of the primary reasons why the noise reduction coefficient historically did not include the value at 125 Hz (128 Hz at the time).

==Factors affecting noise reduction coefficient==

=== Mounting type ===
The NRC is highly dependent on the type of mounting, which, if not specified, is usually a Type A mounting (ABPMA mounting #4) where the material is placed directly on the floor, wall, or ceiling.

Acoustical ceiling tiles are often tested in Type E400 mounting, which simulates a plenum. This deeper airspace typically boosts the low frequency performance of the tile, but may not impact the NRC rating (since the NRC does not include the 125 Hz octave band). 

=== Sample size ===
There is potential for greater error or overemphasizing the acoustic efficacy of a material if tested sample sizes are smaller than the standardized modules. The perimeter-to-area ratio has a significant effect on the overall sound absorption of a material, and may effect the NRC. 

=== Thickness ===
Thicker samples of the same material often absorb more sound and are better at absorbing lower in frequency. Thicker materials also have larger surface area at the sides, resulting in increased sound absorption due to edge effects.

==Applications==
NRC is most commonly used to rate general acoustical properties of acoustic ceiling tiles, baffles, banners, office screens, and acoustic wall panels. It is occasionally used to rate floor coverings.

NRC is intended to be a simplified acoustical rating of room construction and finish materials when the acoustical objectives of the space are less than sensitive. The NRC average is rounded to the nearest 0.05 due to a typical lab repeatability of ±0.05 for 2 standard deviations. Reproducibility between different labs is roughly three times higher at ±0.15 for 2 standard deviations. NRC is a useful rating for general purpose rooms where speech noise build-up is the major concern: lobbies, open offices, reception areas, etc. In certain applications, such as designs of music rehearsal rooms, performance spaces, and rooms employed for critical speech, it is usually more appropriate to consider the sound absorption coefficients at the individual one-third octave band frequencies, including those above and below the bands used to compute NRC.

When evaluating the NRC of similar materials, the following table can be used to approximate whether there&#x27;s an aural difference: 

==New standards==
NRC is being replaced by the Sound Absorption Average (SAA), which is described in the 1999 and newer versions of the ASTM C423 standard. The SAA is a single-number rating of sound absorption properties of a material identical to NRC, except that twelve one-third octave measurements from 200 Hz to 2500 Hz are used, inclusive, instead of just four in a smaller range and rounding is to the nearest multiple of 0.01 instead of 0.05 due to improved repeatability from averaging more points. Given that the SAA averages more points over a slightly larger range, the SAA can be a better indicator of low frequency sound absorption performance.

<text>Morton Gould (December 10, 1913February 21, 1996) was an American composer, conductor, arranger, and pianist.

==Biography==
Morton Gould was born in Richmond Hill, New York, United States. He was recognized early as a child prodigy with abilities in improvisation and composition. His first composition was published at age six. Gould studied at the Institute of Musical Art in New York. His most important teachers were Abby Whiteside and Vincent Jones. Gould was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia.

During the Depression, Gould, while a teenager, worked in New York City playing piano in movie theaters, as well as with vaudeville acts. When Radio City Music Hall opened in December 1932, 19 year old Gould was hired as the staff pianist. By 1935, he was conducting and arranging orchestral programs for New York&#x27;s WOR radio station, where he reached a national audience via the Mutual Broadcasting System, combining popular programming with classical music.

In 1936, Gould married Shirley Uzin, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1943. In the following year, Gould married Shirley Bank. This marriage, too, ended in divorce.

Gould led the orchestra for &quot;The Jack Pearl Show&quot;, which was broadcast on NBC in the 1930s. In the 1940s, Gould appeared on the &quot;Cresta Blanca Carnival&quot; radio program, &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Rolling&quot;, and &quot;Major Bowes&#x27; Shower of Stars&quot;, as well as &quot;The Chrysler Hour&quot; on CBS, where he reached an audience of millions. In 1942, he composed music for the short film &quot;Ring of Steel&quot;, directed by Garson Kanin and produced by the Film Unit of the U.S. Office for Emergency Management. In 1943, he was hired by the William H. Weintraub advertising agency as its musical director, believed to be the first position of its kind in the advertising field.

Gould had four children. On February 16, 1945, Gould&#x27;s son Eric was born. Gould&#x27;s son David was born on March 2, 1947. Gould&#x27;s first daughter, Abby, was born on February 3, 1950, and, on December 21, 1954, his daughter Deborah was born.

Gould composed Broadway scores such as &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; and &quot;Arms and the Girl&quot;; film music such as &quot;Delightfully Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Cinerama Holiday&quot;, and &quot;Windjammer&quot;; music for television series such as &quot;World War One&quot; and the miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;; and ballet scores including &quot;Interplay&quot;, &quot;Fall River Legend&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Old Fashioned&quot;.

Gould&#x27;s music was commissioned by symphony orchestras all over the United States and was also commissioned by the Library of Congress, The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the American Ballet Theatre, and the New York City Ballet. His ability to seamlessly combine multiple musical genres into formal classical structure, while maintaining their distinctive elements, was unsurpassed, and Gould received three commissions for the United States Bicentennial.

As a conductor, Gould led all of the major American orchestras as well as those of Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, and Australia. With his own orchestra, he recorded many classical standards, including Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, on which he also played the piano. Gould arranged and conducted instrumental music from many genres (classical, light classics, &quot;pops&quot;, Broadway, jazz standards, and Latin American) on dozens of LP record albums for major record labels (often RCA Victor), usually credited to Morton Gould and his Orchestra. He won a Grammy Award in 1966 for his recording of Charles Ives&#x27; first symphony, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1983, Gould received the American Symphony Orchestra League&#x27;s Gold Baton Award. In 1986 he was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

For many decades Gould was an active member of ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers). He sat on its board from 1959 and served as president from 1986 until 1994. During his tenure, he lobbied for the intellectual rights of performing artists as the internet was becoming a force that would greatly affect ASCAP&#x27;s members.

Incorporating new styles into his repertoire as they emerged, Gould incorporated wildly disparate elements, including a rapping narrator in a work titled &quot;The Jogger and the Dinosaur,&quot; American tap dancing in his &quot;Tap Dance Concerto&quot; for dancer and orchestra, and a singing fire department titled &quot;Hosedown&quot;—commissioned works for the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony. In 1993, his work &quot;Ghost Waltzes&quot; was commissioned for the ninth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. In the same year, he received the El Premio &quot;Billboard&quot; for his contributions to Latin music in the United States. In 1994, Gould received the Kennedy Center Honor in recognition of lifetime contributions to American culture.

In 1995, Gould was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music for &quot;Stringmusic&quot;, a composition commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra in recognition of the final season of director Mstislav Rostropovich. In 2005, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He also was a member of the board of the American Symphony Orchestra League and of the National Endowment for the Arts music panel.
Gould&#x27;s original manuscripts, personal papers and other pertinent pieces are archived in the Library of Congress and available to the public.

Gould died on February 21, 1996, in Orlando, Florida, where he was the first resident guest composer/conductor at the Disney Institute and was in the middle of a three-day tribute honoring his music. He was 82 years old.

<doc id="796709" wikidata="Q1939352" url="?curid=796709" title="Misty (song)">
<text>&quot;Misty&quot; is a jazz standard written and originally recorded in 1954 by pianist Erroll Garner. He composed it as an instrumental in the traditional 32-bar format, and recorded it on July 27, 1954 for the album &quot;Contrasts&quot;. Lyrics were added later by Johnny Burke. It appeared on Johnny Mathis&#x27; 1959 album &quot;Heavenly&quot;, and this recording reached number 12 on the U.S. Pop Singles chart later that year. It has since become Mathis’ signature song.

The song has been recorded by many other artists, including versions by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Ray Stevens who released a hit country version in 1975. Recordings by both Johnny Mathis and Erroll Garner have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It was ranked number 174 in the list of the Songs of the Century compiled by Recording Industry Association of America and National Endowment for the Arts.

==Composition==
Erroll Garner was inspired to write &quot;Misty&quot; on a flight from San Francisco to Chicago which passed through a thunderstorm: as the plane descended into O&#x27;Hare, Garner looked through the window to see a rainbow glowing through a haze and was moved to begin composing &quot;Misty&quot; on the spot, striking imaginary piano keys on his knees as he hummed the notes he imagined (causing his neighboring passenger to summon a flight attendant to assist the apparently ill Garner).

The lyrics were added later by Johnny Burke. Burke was initially reluctant to create lyrics for the tune but was persuaded to do so at the insistence of his pianist, Herb Mesick. It was said that Mesick played the tune every time Burke came into the room, until Burke said: &quot;Alright, give me the damn music, and I&#x27;ll do it.&quot; Burke wrote the lyrics in two to three hours. 

==Early recordings==
Erroll Garner first recorded his rendition of &quot;Misty&quot; on piano on July 27, 1954, accompanied by Wyatt Ruther on bass and Fats Heard on drums. The recording was first released in October 1954 and credited to the Erroll Garner Trio, and it was included in Garner&#x27;s album &quot;Contrasts&quot; released in December 1954. Garner later re-recorded the song with an orchestral arrangement by Mitch Miller for his album &quot;Other Voices&quot; in 1957. Instrumental versions were also recorded by Georgie Auld and Johnny Costa in 1955. Garner&#x27;s original recording was ranked No. 174 in the list of the Songs of the Century compiled by RIAA and NEA. 

After lyrics were written for &quot;Misty&quot;, Dakota Staton was the first to record the song in 1957. A number of artists also recorded the song, but it was the recording by Sarah Vaughan that drew greater attention to it. Sarah Vaughan recorded the song in a July 1958 Paris session, with an arrangement by Quincy Jones for her album &quot;Vaughan and Violins&quot;. It was released backed with &quot;Broken Hearted Melody&quot;, and it reached No. 6 on the Bubbling Under chart in July 1959. Those who recorded the song after Sarah Vaughan included Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and most notably Johnny Mathis, who created the best-known version of it. 

==Johnny Mathis version==
===Background===
Johnny Mathis first heard Erroll Garner play the tune when he was a teenager and told Garner that he would love to sing it if Garner had lyrics for it. A few years later, having heard Sarah Vaughan&#x27;s version of the song, he chose &quot;Misty&quot; as one of the possible songs for his 1959 album &quot;Heavenly&quot; and informed Erroll Garner that he would record the song. However, at the recording session for the album, it was scheduled that Johnny Mathis should record a show tune rather than &quot;Misty&quot;. Accounts differ as to whether it was Erroll Garner or his business manager, Martha Glaser, who turned up unexpectedly at the recording session, and Johnny Mathis then insisted on recording &quot;Misty&quot; to fulfil his promise to record the song with the unexpected guest in attendance.

Glenn Osser arranged the song at short notice, with Andy Ackers playing the piano. Johnny Mathis revealed that, on the high-pitched note when he first started singing &quot;On my own&quot; after the instrumental break, he used a technique of standing a distance from the microphone and then walked slowly toward it to create a fade in effect. Johnny Mathis said that &quot;Misty&quot; was the song of which he was the most proud, because he recorded the song the way he wanted to, rather than relying on the producer, Mitch Miller.

The song was initially released as a back-to-back single together with Garner&#x27;s version intended only for those in the broadcasting industry, but due to heavy demand Columbia released Mathis&#x27; recording as a commercial single in September 1959. It reached No. 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although the song is not Mathis&#x27; highest charting song, it became his signature song. Mathis received his first Grammy nomination for the song at the 3rd Annual Grammy Awards in the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category. Both Mathis&#x27; and Garner&#x27;s recordings were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, Garner in 1991 and Mathis in 2002.

===Chart performance===

====Weekly singles====
==&quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;==
Clint Eastwood used the instrumental version in his 1971 film &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;, a low-budget film that proved to be a box-office success. Eastwood was said to have paid Garner a $25,000 fee for the right to use the tune in his film.

==Ray Stevens version==
===Background and release===
In 1975, singer Ray Stevens released an up-tempo country rendition of this song. It is the title track of his twelfth studio album. Stevens recounted that the song was recorded on the second take when experimenting in the studio. His version won a Grammy in the category of Music Arrangement of the Year. This version peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom.

<text>Andreas Bernhard Lyonel Feininger (December 27, 1906 – February 18, 1999) was an American photographer and a writer on photographic technique. He was noted for his dynamic black-and-white scenes of Manhattan and for studies of the structures of natural objects.

==Biography==
Feininger was born in Paris, France, the eldest son of Julia Berg, a German Jew, and the American painter and art educator Lyonel Feininger (1871-1956). His paternal grandparents were the German violinist Karl Feininger (1844–1922) and the American singer Elizabeth Feininger (née Lutz), who was also of German descent. His younger brother was the painter and photographer T. Lux Feininger (1910–2011).

In 1908 the Feininger family moved to Berlin, and in 1919 to Weimar, where Lyonel Feininger took up the post of Master of the Printing Workshop at the newly formed Bauhaus art school.

Andreas left school at 16, in 1922, to study at the Bauhaus; he graduated as a cabinetmaker in April 1925. Afterwards he studied architecture, initially at the &quot;Staatliche Bauschule Weimar&quot; (State Architectural College, Weimar) and later at the &quot;Staatliche Bauschule Zerbst&quot;. (Zerbst is a city in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, about 20 km from Dessau, where the Bauhaus moved to in 1926.) The Feininger family moved to Dessau with the Bauhaus. In addition to continuing his architectural studies in Zerbst, Andreas developed an interest in photography and was given guidance by neighbour and Bauhaus teacher László Moholy-Nagy.

In 1936, he gave up architecture and moved to Sweden, where he focused on photography. In advance of World War II, in 1939, Feininger immigrated to the U.S., where he established himself as a freelance photographer. In 1943, he joined the staff of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, an association that lasted until 1962.

Feininger became famous for his photographs of New York. Other frequent subjects among his works were science and nature, as seen in bones, shells, plants, and minerals in the images of which he often stressed their structure. Rarely did he photograph people or make portraits.

Feininger wrote comprehensive manuals about photography, of which the best known is &quot;The Complete Photographer&quot;. In the introduction to one of Feininger&#x27;s books of photographs, Ralph Hattersley, the editor of the photography journal &quot;Infinity&quot;, described him as &quot;one of the great architects who helped create photography as we know it today.&quot; In 1966, the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP) awarded Feininger its highest distinction, the Robert Leavitt Award. In 1991, the International Center of Photography awarded Feininger the Infinity Lifetime Achievement Award.

Today, Feininger&#x27;s photographs are in the permanent collections of the Center for Creative Photography, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum, and the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York.

<doc id="796727" wikidata="Q8038380" url="?curid=796727" title="Writ of election">
<text>A writ of election is a writ issued ordering the holding of an election. In Commonwealth countries writs are the usual mechanism by which general elections are called and are issued by the head of state or their representative. In the United States, writs are more commonly used to call special elections for political offices.

In some countries, especially in Canada, the process of issuing writs of election is referred to as &quot;dropping the writ&quot;, likely derived from the phrase &quot;drawing up [the writ]&quot;.

In some parliamentary systems, the head of government (e.g. prime minister or premier) advises the head of state to issue writs of election (typically following the dissolution of parliament in order to hold general elections, but also for by-elections). The head of state usually reserves the right to refuse the request, in which case the head of government is required by convention or statute to resign. For example, in the case of a minority government, the head of state can deny the request for dissolution and ask the leader of another parliamentary party to form a government. In some cases, such as with the president of Ireland, there are specific limitations on when a head of state can refuse the request. Even then, the right is rarely exercised, as it is likely to precipitate a constitutional crisis (see, for example, the Canadian King–Byng Affair of 1926).

== Timing ==
Usually, according to parliamentary law, the head of government must regularly call an election but it is otherwise within their discretion when to drop the writ, up to the time when the parliament has served its full term. At that point, an election must be called by issuing the writs. An exception to this principle is if a fixed-term election law has been enacted.

In some states and territories of Australia, such as New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory, it is normally required by law that the parliament must run its full term before issuing the writs. Early dissolutions are allowed by the governor (NSW, Vic, SA) or federal minister for territories (ACT) only if certain objective criteria are met – in particular, if the parliament is unable to agree on the annual budget. Similarly, in New Zealand, it is the norm for parliament to run full term (or very close to full term) unless the prime minister cannot govern or feels they must bring an important issue before the nation.

Opposition parties can bring down the government by passing a motion of no confidence, in which the prime minister is required by convention or specific law to either drop the writ or resign; parliaments do not have the right to force the prime minister to drop the writ.

==Practice by country==

===Australia===
In Australia, writs for election are issued by the governor-general for the House of Representatives within 10 days of the dissolution or expiration of the House and by the state governors for the election of senators for their respective states, while writs for the election of territory senators are issued by the governor-general. State governors also issue writs for elections of their respective state parliaments.

The writs are issued to the relevant electoral officer or returning officer, as the case may be, who returns them after the election has been held within a fixed period.

===Canada===
In Canada, a writ is the only way of holding an election for the House of Commons. When the government wants to or, is required to, dissolve Parliament, a writ of election is drawn up for each riding (electoral district) in Canada by the chief electoral officer. They are then formally issued by the governor general. Similarly where a single riding becomes vacant, a writ is issued to trigger the by-election for that seat. A writ with the name of the successful candidate noted on its back will be returned to the chief electoral officer.

====&quot;Dropping the writ&quot;====
An informal term used in Canada to describe the issuing of writs of election is &quot;dropping the writ&quot;. The usage of the word &quot;drop&quot; in this context is likely derived from the phrase &quot;draw up&quot;. Although it is still considered stylistically inappropriate by some, who assert that the correct phrase is &quot;the writs are issued&quot;, or the &quot;writs are drawn up&quot;, the term has been recorded in academic text.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Electoral Act 1993 mandates that, following the dissolution of Parliament, the governor-general signs only a single writ instructing the Electoral Commission to hold a general election. After the general election has been held, the writ is returned to the clerk of the House of Representatives with the names of all successful candidates who have been elected to electorate seats. A writ will also be issued when a by-election is held.
===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, a writ is the only way of holding an election for the House of Commons. When the government wants to, or is required to, dissolve Parliament, a writ of election is drawn up for each constituency in the UK by the clerk of the Crown in Chancery. They are then formally issued by the monarch. (When the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in effect, writs were issued by the lord chancellor.)

Where a single constituency becomes vacant, a writ is issued by the speaker of the House of Commons to trigger the by-election for that seat. 

After the election has been held in a constituency, the acting returning officer must write the name of the winning candidate on the writ and return it to the clerk of the Crown.

===United States===
In the United States, this writ is issued mainly by state governors for filling vacancies in the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, or the states&#x27; own legislatures.

<text>The Mobulidae (manta rays and devilfishes) are a family of rays consisting mostly of large species living in the open ocean rather than on the sea bottom.

==Taxonomy==
The Mobulidae have been variously considered a subfamily of the Myliobatidae by some authors, and a distinct family by others, but recent work favors the latter. Two genera have been traditionally recognized, &quot;Manta&quot; and &quot;Mobula&quot;, but recent DNA analysis shows that &quot;Mobula&quot; as traditionally recognized is paraphyletic to manta rays, making &quot;Manta&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Mobula&quot; and &quot;Mobula&quot; the only extant genus of the family.

==Fossil record==
Several genera of fossil mobulids are known, including &quot;Archaeomanta&quot;, &quot;Burnhamia&quot;, &quot;Eomobula&quot;, and &quot;Paramobula&quot;.

<text>Gia Kancheli (; 10 August 1935 – 2 October 2019) was a Georgian composer. He was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, and resided in Belgium in later life.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kancheli lived first in Berlin, and from 1995 in Antwerp, where he became composer-in-residence for the Royal Flemish Philharmonic. He died in Tbilisi at age 84.

==Life==
In his symphonies, Kancheli&#x27;s musical language typically consists of slow scraps of minor-mode melody against long, subdued, anguished string discords. Rodion Shchedrin called Kancheli &quot;an ascetic with the temperament of a maximalist; a restrained Vesuvius&quot;.

Kancheli wrote seven symphonies, and what he termed a liturgy for viola and orchestra, &quot;Mourned by the Wind&quot;. the Philadelphia Orchestra under Yuri Temirkanov gave the American premiere of his Fourth Symphony in 1978, not long before the cultural freeze in the United States against Soviet culture. Glasnost allowed Kancheli to regain exposure, and he began to receive frequent commissions, as well as performances in Europe and North America.

Championed internationally by Lera Auerbach, Dennis Russell Davies, Jansug Kakhidze, Gidon Kremer, Yuri Bashmet, Kim Kashkashian, Mstislav Rostropovich, and the Kronos Quartet, Kancheli saw world premieres of his works in Seattle, as well as with the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur. He continued to receive regular commissions. Recordings of his works are regularly released, notably on the ECM label.

His work &quot;Styx&quot; is for solo viola, chorus and orchestra. It is a farewell to his friends Avet Terterian and Alfred Schnittke, whose names the chorus sings during the piece.

For two decades, Kancheli was the music director of the Rustaveli Theatre in Tbilisi. He composed an opera, &quot;Music for the Living&quot;, in collaboration with Rustaveli director Robert Sturua, and in 1999, the opera was restaged for the Deutsches National Theater in Weimar.

He wrote music for films such as Georgiy Daneliya&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Kin-dza-dza!&quot; (1986) and its 2013 animated remake.

<doc id="796746" wikidata="Q7274429" url="?curid=796746" title="R18 (British Board of Film Classification)">
<text>R18 (Restricted 18) is a film and video classification given by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). It is intended to provide a classification for works that do not breach UK law, but exceed what the BBFC considers acceptable in the 18 category. In practice, this means hardcore pornography.

Under the terms of the Video Recordings Act 1984 all non-exempt videos sold or distributed within the UK must be given a certificate by the BBFC. The distributor must decide whether a video is exempt. Uncertificated recordings are not illegal, regardless of content (except where the content itself is illegal), but supply (i.e. sale, rental, loan or gift) of them is. The R18 certificate is the most restrictive of the certificates, allowing films in the category to be shown only in specially licensed cinemas, or sold in licensed sex shops; admission to R18-rated films or sale of R18-rated recordings is restricted to persons aged 18 years and over.

== Background ==

The R18 category was created in 1982 in response to the recommendations in 1979 of the Home Office Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship chaired by Sir Bernard Williams. Originally, the R18 classification was only used for films featuring simulated sex, but the BBFC found itself forced to award R18 certificates to hardcore films in 2000 after a series of legal appeals and a judicial review of those appeals.

The introduction of the R18 certificate for hardcore films is widely seen by observers as a reaction to more liberal attitudes in British society to pornography, the &quot;de facto&quot; legalisation of the import of hardcore pornography (but not its sale) across EU member countries because of customs law harmonisation, and the widespread availability of unregulated pornography over the Internet.

Most cuts made by the BBFC are in the R18 category (e.g., 13.6% of R18 videos were cut in 2011, compared with 7.5% for the 18 category, and 0.5% or less for other categories). On the BBFC website, R18-rated works are filtered out of the main public search (unless an option to show them is selected) as their titles frequently contain profanity and/or vulgar language.

== Regulation of content ==
The BBFC specifies in detail what kinds of acts are permitted to be depicted in works receiving an R18 certificate, and which are not. In particular, it prohibits:
* Works judged to be illegal under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.
* Material deemed likely to encourage an interest in &quot;sexually abusive&quot; activity, which can include adults role-playing as non adults.
* Depiction of non-consensual acts (including role-play).
* Use of bondage which prevents indicating a withdrawal of consent (e.g., gags).
* Infliction of pain which may cause lasting physical harm, whether real or simulated.
* Penetration by any object deemed likely to cause physical harm.
* Depiction of any sexual threats, coercion, humiliation or abuse, even if consensual, unless clearly depicted as a consensual role-playing game.
* Depictions of sexual violence and most fetishes.

Although R18 does allow for the depiction of most consensual sex acts such as vaginal sexual intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, anal sex and some moderate BDSM between any combination of men and women, the following is prohibited:

* Material which is deemed in breach or potential breach of current interpretation of the Protection of Children Act 1978.
* Roleplay where one participant plays a child or incest is featured, and rape fantasies (even if all participants are in fact consenting adults). Much of Marc Dorcel&#x27;s low budget work and many U.S. &quot;barely legal&quot; films are prohibited from UK release under this rubric.
* Rough sex such as spitting, hair pulling, and gagging during fellatio – strong verbal abuse may also be removed if continuous and seen as dehumanising.
* Penetration with large or dangerous objects, or those associated with violence- scenes involving power drills attached to dildos, imitation firearms, ice cubes, spiked spheres, hammers, pool cues and many other items have been cut.
* Urolagnia – simple urination is permitted but urination onto or into a person, licking or drinking the urine, or urinating while masturbating will be cut; urination by a woman while she rubs her breasts and female ejaculation have previously been removed.
* Expulsion of enemas onto a person, licking/drinking enema fluid, any sight of faeces or vomit, protracted focus on menstrual blood- only one live action work has been cut for scenes involving menstruation, and several Japanese animations (hentai);.
* Use of illegal drugs during a sex scene.
* Promotion of dangerous fetish activities.
* Verbal references to rape, incest or childhood sexual activity or development within the sex scene.
* Sight of serious injuries or blood after sado-masochistic scenes; dripping of hot wax; images of bound and gagged performers (as they cannot withdraw consent).
* Depiction of coprophagia, bloodplay, and fisting.

The acts include those deemed likely to contravene the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Depiction of urolagnia, fisting and various hardcore BDSM acts were deemed legal in January 2012 in R v Peacock. Following a public consultation, the Crown Prosecution Service published guidelines in 2019 indicating that pornography depicting consenting adults engaged in legal acts would no longer be prosecuted under the Act, provided no serious harm was caused and the likely audience was over the age of 18.;
it is unclear as to whether the BBFC will revise its guidelines, but they announced that they are discussing what to do next.

== Legal provisions ==
Films given the R18 certificate may only be exhibited in licensed cinemas and can only be sold on physical media direct to the buyer in person in licensed sex shops. Ofcom also prohibit the transmission of R18 material as part of a television broadcast, although these restrictions do not apply to hotel television systems which are not regulated by Ofcom.

The BBFC do not have jurisdiction over content distributed via non-physical media; however, in 2014 the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amended the Communications Act 2003 to extend the statutory and legal obligations for the distribution of R18 content to &quot;on-demand&quot; programme services, such as streaming media/video on demand over the internet or mobile phone networks and web-based platforms. The revisions make it a criminal offence to not adequately restrict access to works rated R18 by the BBFC—or any work that would be likely to receive a R18 classification if it were submitted—to those aged over 18. These provisions are only applicable to services whose principal purpose is to provide content that is comparable to what is normally found in television services and if the service enables the user to select the programme and permits viewing at a time chosen by them.

== Recent developments ==
In 2004 a group of video distributors appealed to the Video Appeals Committee (VAC) against the BBFC&#x27;s decision to award R18 certificates to 9 films that the distributors wished to be reclassified as 18. A press release issued by the BBFC on 20 July 2005 announced that the VAC had dismissed that appeal.

The BBFC has previously granted 18 certificates for movies containing short scenes of unsimulated sex, such as Catherine Breillat&#x27;s &quot;Romance&quot; (in 1999), Virginie Despentes&#x27;s &quot;Baise Moi&quot; (in 2000), Patrice Chéreau&#x27;s &quot;Intimacy&quot; (in 2001), Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s &quot;9 Songs&quot; (in 2004), short-film compilation &quot;Destricted&quot; (in 2006), and in 2008 the hardcore version of Tinto Brass&#x27;s &quot;Caligula&quot; was passed uncut for DVD with an 18.

The Digital Economy Act 2017 includes powers to require age-verification for pornographic Internet sites and the government accepted an amendment to allow the regulator to require ISPs to block access to non-compliant sites. As the BBFC are expected to become the regulator, this has caused discussion about ISPs being required to block Internet pornography that would be prohibited under an R18 certificate, the prohibition of some of which is itself controversial.

<text>The Second Council of Lyon was the fourteenth ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church, convoked on 31 March 1272 and convened in Lyon, Kingdom of Arles (in modern France), in 1274. Pope Gregory X presided over the council, called to act on a pledge by Byzantine emperor Michael VIII to reunite the Eastern church with the West. The council was attended by about 300 bishops, 60 abbots and more than a thousand prelates or their procurators, among whom were the representatives of the universities. Due to the great number of attendees, those who had come to Lyon without being specifically summoned were given &quot;leave to depart with the blessing of God&quot; and of the Pope. Among others who attended the council were James I of Aragon, the ambassador of the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos with members of the Greek clergy and the ambassadors of Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhanate. Thomas Aquinas had been summoned to the council, but died en route at Fossanova Abbey. Bonaventure was present at the first four sessions but died at Lyon on 15 July 1274. As at the First Council of Lyon, Thomas Cantilupe was an English attendee and a papal chaplain.

In addition to Aragon, which James represented in person, representatives of the kings of Germany, England, Scotland, France, the Spains and Sicily were present, with procurators also representing the kingdoms of Norway, Sweden, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, and the &quot;realm of Dacia&quot;. In the procedures to be observed in the council, for the first time the nations appeared as represented elements in an ecclesiastical council, as they had already become represented in the governing of medieval universities. This innovation marks a stepping-stone towards the acknowledgment of coherent ideas of nationhood, which were in the process of creating the European nation-states.

The main topics discussed at the council were the conquest of the Holy Land and the union of the Eastern and Western Churches. The first session took place on 7 May 1274 and was followed by five additional sessions on 18 May 1274, 4 or 7 June 1274, 6 July 1274, 16 July 1274, and 17 July 1274. By the end of the council, 31 constitutions were promulgated. In the second session, the fathers approved the decree Zelus fidei, which contained no juridical statutes but rather summed up constitutions about the perils of the Holy Land, the means for paying for a proposed crusade, the excommunication of pirates and corsairs and those who protected them or traded with them, a declaration of peace among Christians, a grant of an indulgence for those willing to go on crusade, restoration of communion with the Greeks, and the definition of the order and procedure to be observed in the council. The Greeks conceded on the issue of the Filioque (two words added to the Nicene Creed), and union was proclaimed, but the union was later repudiated by Andronicus II, heir to Michael VIII. The council also recognized Rudolf I as Holy Roman Emperor, ending the interregnum.

==Union of the Churches==
Wishing to end the Great Schism that divided the Catholic Church from Eastern Orthodoxy, Pope Gregory X sent an embassy to Michael VIII, who had reconquered Constantinople, putting an end to the remnants of the Latin Empire in the East, and he asked Latin despots in the East to curb their ambitions. Eastern dignitaries arrived at Lyon on 24 June 1274 presenting a letter from the Emperor. On 29 June 1274 (the Feast of Peter and Paul, patronal feast of the popes), Gregory celebrated Mass in St John&#x27;s Church where both sides took part. The Greeks read the Nicene Creed, with the Western addition of the Filioque clause sung three times. The council was seemingly a success, but did not provide a lasting solution to the schism; the Emperor was anxious to heal the schism, but the Eastern clergy opposed the decisions of the council. Patriarch Joseph of Constantinople abdicated, and was replaced by John Bekkos, a convert to the cause of union. In spite of a sustained campaign by Bekkos to defend the union intellectually, and vigorous and brutal repression of opponents by Michael, the vast majority of Byzantine Christians remained implacably opposed to union with the Latin &quot;heretics&quot;. Michael&#x27;s death in December 1282 put an end to the union of Lyons. His son and successor Andronicus II repudiated the union in the Council of Blachernae (1285), and Bekkos was forced to abdicate, being eventually exiled and imprisoned under house arrest until his death in 1297.

==Plans for a Crusade==
The council drew up plans for a crusade (&quot;passagium generale&quot;) to recover the Holy Land, which was to be financed by a tithe imposed for six years on all the benefices of Christendom. The plans were approved but nothing concrete was done. James I of Aragon wished to organize the expedition at once, but this was opposed by the Knights Templar. The Franciscan friar Fidentius of Padua, who had experience in the Holy Land, was commissioned by the pope to write a report on the recovery of the Holy Land.

Ambassadors of the Khan of the Tatars negotiated with the Pope, who asked them to leave Christians in peace during their war against Islam. The Mongol leader Abaqa Khan sent a delegation of 13-16 Mongols to the council, which created a great stir, particularly when their leader underwent a public baptism. Among the embassy were David of Ashby, and the clerk Rychaldus. According to one chronicler, &quot;The Mongols came, not because of the Faith, but to conclude an alliance with the Christians&quot;.

Abaqa&#x27;s Latin secretary Rychaldus delivered a report to the council, which outlined previous European-Ilkhanid relations under Abaqa&#x27;s father, Hulagu, where after welcoming the Christian ambassadors to his court, Hulagu had agreed to exempt Latin Christians from taxes and charges, in exchange for their prayers for the Qaghan. According to Richardus, Hulagu had also prohibited the molestation of Frank establishments, and had committed to return Jerusalem to the Franks. Richardus told the assembly that even after Hulagu&#x27;s death, Abaqa was still determined to drive the Mamluks from Syria.

At the council, Pope Gregory promulgated a new Crusade to start in 1278 in liaison with the Mongols. The Pope put in place a vast program to launch the Crusade, which was written down in his &quot;Constitutions for the zeal of the faith&quot;. This text puts forward four main decisions to accomplish the Crusade: the imposition of a new tax during three years, the interdiction of any kind of trade with the Saracens, the supply of ships by the Italian maritime Republics, and the alliance of the West with Byzantium and the Il-Khan Abagha. However, despite papal plans, there was little support from European monarchs, who at this point were more likely to give lip service to the idea of a Crusade than to commit actual troops. The Pope&#x27;s death in 1276 put an end to any such plans, and the money that had been gathered was instead distributed in Italy.

==Other topics debated==

The council dealt with the reform of the Church, regarding which Gregory had sent out inquiries. Several bishops and abbots were deposed for unworthiness, and some mendicant orders were suppressed. On the other hand, the two new orders of Dominicans and Franciscans were approved.

There had been several lengthy vacancies of the Holy See, most recently the &quot;sede vacante&quot; that had lasted from the death of Clement IV, 29 November 1268, until Gregory&#x27;s election, 1 September 1271. The council decided that in future the cardinals should not leave the conclave until they had elected a pope. This decision was suspended in 1276 by Pope Adrian V, and then revoked by Pope John XXI. It has since been re-established, and is the basis of present legislation on papal elections.

Finally, the council dealt with the Imperial throne, which Alfonso X of Castile claimed. His claim was disallowed by the Pope, and Rudolph I was proclaimed King of the Romans and future emperor on 6 June 1274.

<doc id="796750" wikidata="Q1973252" url="?curid=796750" title="Septoplasty">
<text>Septoplasty (, &quot;septum&quot; + , &quot;to shape&quot;), or alternatively submucous septal resection and septal reconstruction, is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten a deviated nasal septum – the nasal septum being the partition between the two nasal cavities. Ideally, the septum should run down the center of the nose. When it deviates into one of the cavities, it narrows that cavity and impedes airflow. Deviated nasal septum or “crooked” internal nose can occur at childbirth or as the result of an injury or other trauma. If the wall that functions as a separator of both sides of the nose is tilted towards one side at a degree greater than 50%, it might cause difficulty breathing. Often the inferior turbinate on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed &quot;compensatory hypertrophy&quot;. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal obstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, while the recovery time could be up to several weeks. Put simply, septoplasty is a surgery that helps repair the passageways in the nose making it easier to breathe. This surgery is usually performed on patients with a deviated septum, recurrent rhinitis, or sinus issues.

== Procedure ==

The procedure usually involves a judicious excision/realignment of a portion of the bone and/or cartilage in the nasal cavity. Under general or local anesthesia, the surgeon works through the nostrils, making an incision in the lining of the septum to reach the cartilage/bone targeted in the operation. This may be performed using an endoscope or with open techniques. Sufficient cartilage and bone is preserved for structural support. After the septum is straightened, it may then be stabilized temporarily with small plastic tubes, splints, or sutures internally. Skin grafts can be placed internally to support the internal structures.

===Indications===
Apart from in patients with deviated nasal septum causing airway obstruction leading to difficulty with breathing, recurrent rhinitis, or sinusitis, septoplasty is done as an approach to hypophysectomy. It is sometimes done as well to cure recurrent nosebleed (epistaxis) due to septal spur.

===Contraindications===
Septoplasty should not be done in acute nasal or sinus infection. It should also be avoided if the person has untreated diabetes, severe hypertension or bleeding diathesis.

===Post-operation===
Unless there are unusual complications, there is no swelling or discoloration of the external nose or face with septoplasty alone. Packing is rare with modern surgical techniques, but splinting the inside of the nose for a few days is common; the splints are not visible externally. Patients who have nasal splints should receive prophylactic antibiotics against gram positive organisms to prevent possible toxic shock syndrome. One percent of patients can experience excessive bleeding afterwards — the risk period lasts up to two weeks. This could require packing or cautery, but is generally handled safely and without compromise of the ultimate surgical result. Septal perforation and septal hematoma are possible, as is a decrease in the sense of smell. Temporary numbness of the front upper teeth after surgery is common. Sometimes the numbness extends to the upper jaw and the tip of the nose. This almost always resolves within several months. 

The nasal tissues should mostly stabilize within 3-6 months post-surgery, although shifting is still possible for up to and over a year afterwards.

A randomised controlled trial found that people who had septoplasty had a greater improvement in their symptoms and quality of life after 6 months than people who managed their nasal airway obstruction with nasal sprays. 

===Complications of septoplasty===
*Nasal septum perforation due to the bilateral trauma of the mucoperichondrial flaps opposite each other.
*Septal hematoma and septal abscess.
*Adhesions and synechiae between septal mucosa and lateral nasal wall.
*Saddle nose due to over-resection of the dorsal wall of the septal cartilage.
*Dropped nasal tip due to resection of the caudal margin.

Moddelmog has 19 years of career experience in president and CEO roles. Her areas of expertise are strategic planning, marketing, brand and product development, and assembling and managing high performance teams and brand revitalization. Moddelmog is currently the President and CEO of the Woodruff Arts Center, a role she took on in September 2020.

==Education==
Moddelmog earned a master&#x27;s degree in journalism and mass communication from the University of Georgia and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Georgia Southern University. She has also attended Executive Education program at Harvard University and Northwestern&#x27;s Kellogg School of Management, and has her National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) certification.

==Previous employment==
Prior to joining MAC, Moddelmog was president of Atlanta-based Arby&#x27;s Restaurant Group, an international quick-service restaurant chain with approximately 3,500 units and annual system-wide sales of approximately $3 billion. Under her leadership, Arby&#x27;s had 12 consecutive quarters of comparable store sales increases and increased EBITDA by 80 percent from 2011 to 2012. Her team created new brand positioning, launched new product platforms and new advertising campaigns and redesigned the logo.

In 2006, she was chosen as president and CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the world&#x27;s largest grassroots organization working to eradicate breast cancer through education, awareness, public policy and science throughout the globe. While at Komen, Moddelmog established a Scientific Advisory Board with an annual grant of $100 million for scientific research, and established the Susan G. Komen Advocacy Alliance, a 501(c)(4) designed to advocate for breast cancer patients at the federal and state level. While she was president, Komen received its first-ever 4-Star Rating from Charity Navigator, there was an increase the number of corporate sponsors and she led international mission delegations to Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Moddelmog was the first woman to lead an international restaurant company when in 1995 she was named president of Church&#x27;s Chicken, the world&#x27;s third largest chicken brand with 1,500+ restaurants in 15 countries and nearly $1 billion in system sales.

<doc id="796760" wikidata="Q3058230" url="?curid=796760" title="Projective Hilbert space">
<text>In mathematics and the foundations of quantum mechanics, the projective Hilbert space or ray space formula_1 of a complex Hilbert space formula_2 is the set of equivalence classes formula_3 of non-zero vectors formula_4, for the equivalence relation formula_5 on formula_2 given by

:formula_7 if and only if formula_8 for some non-zero complex number formula_9.

This is the usual construction of projectivization, applied to a complex Hilbert space. In quantum mechanics, the equivalence classes formula_3 are also referred to as rays or projective rays.

==Overview==

The physical significance of the projective Hilbert space is that in quantum theory, the wave functions formula_11 and formula_12 represent the same &quot;physical state&quot;, for any formula_13. The Born rule demands that if the system is physical and measurable, its wave function has unit norm, formula_14, in which case it is called a normalized wave function. The unit norm constraint does not completely determine formula_11 within the ray, since formula_11 could be multiplied by any formula_9 with absolute value 1 (the circle group formula_18 action) and retain its normalization. Such a formula_9 can be written as formula_20 with formula_21 called the global phase.

Rays that differ by such a formula_9 correspond to the same state (cf. quantum state (algebraic definition), given a C*-algebra of observables and a representation on formula_2). No measurement can recover the phase of a ray; it is not observable. One says that formula_18 is a gauge group of the first kind.

If formula_2 is an irreducible representation of the algebra of observables then the rays induce pure states. Convex linear combinations of rays naturally give rise to density matrix which (still in case of an irreducible representation) correspond to mixed states.

In the case formula_2 is finite-dimensional, i.e., formula_27, the Hilbert space reduces to a finite-dimensional inner product space and the set of projective rays may be treated as a complex projective space; it is a homogeneous space for a unitary group formula_28. That is,

:formula_29,

which carries a Kähler metric, called the Fubini–Study metric, derived from the Hilbert space&#x27;s norm.

As such, the projectivization of, e.g., two-dimensional complex Hilbert space (the space describing one qubit) is the complex projective line formula_30. This is known as the Bloch sphere or, equivalently, the Riemann sphere. See Hopf fibration for details of the projectivization construction in this case.

==Product==
The Cartesian product of projective Hilbert spaces is not a projective space. The Segre mapping is an embedding of the Cartesian product of two projective spaces into the projective space associated to the tensor product of the two Hilbert spaces, given by formula_31. In quantum theory, it describes how to make states of the composite system from states of its constituents. It is only an embedding, not a surjection; most of the tensor product space does not lie in its range and represents &quot;entangled states&quot;.

<doc id="796762" wikidata="Q6549141" url="?curid=796762" title="Lime Spiders">
<text>Lime Spiders were an Australian punk rock band which formed in 1979 with Mick Blood on lead vocals. He was later joined by Richard Lawson on drums, and David Sparks on guitar. Their debut studio album, &quot;The Cave Comes Alive!&quot; was released in June 1987 and reached the top 60 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Their most successful single, &quot;Weirdo Libido&quot;, was released in January that year and reached the top 50 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart. In April its music video was the first ever shown on Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV music series &quot;rage&quot;. The track was used on the 1988 feature film &quot;Young Einstein&quot;″s soundtrack. The group disbanded in 1990 and in 1999 Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted they had provided &quot;raucous sound mixed screaming vocals and wild, fuzz-tone guitar riffs to arrive at a mutant strain of acid punk that bordered on heavy metal&quot;.

==History==
=== Early days: &quot;25th Hour&quot; to &quot;Slave Girl&quot; ===
The Lime Spiders were formed in 1979 by Michael Patrick &quot;Mick&quot; Blood on lead vocals, who cites their influences as being 1960s garage bands with psychedelic rock. Early fellow members included Eric Roman Grothe on guitar, Dave Guest on bass guitar, and Darryl John Mather on guitar. The band&#x27;s name relates to a non-alcoholic cocktail – a combination of vanilla ice cream and lime soft drink (soda). The group&#x27;s first show was supporting The Lonely Hearts on Christmas Eve 1979, which Mather later recalled: &quot;We were absolutely horrible. So horrible that people didn&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t think I got it, either. We came back properly in late 1980&quot;.

By February 1981 the line-up had stabilised with Blood, Guest and Mather joined by Geoff Cleary on drums. In August that year the group added Richard Jakimyszyn on lead guitar, with Bill Gibson (later bassist for The Eastern Dark) often acting as MC and adding backing vocals and tambourine. The band played regularly, mostly around Sydney&#x27;s inner city venues, but by February the following year they had split up. During September that year they reconvened with a new drummer, Stephen Rawle (ex-Room 101), replacing Cleary. The group entered a Battle of the Bands competition at the Southern Cross Hotel, the major prize being the recording and release of a single on Green records. The competition ran over three months and included 64 bands: The Lime Spiders won the competition, with one of their opponents in the final being The Most, who would later come to figure significantly in their story.

&quot;I didn&#x27;t cope well that night. We&#x27;d moved from hobbyists to being on the verge of becoming serious – we were rewarded with a record deal, like Radio Birdman had six years earlier. We got up and didn&#x27;t miss a beat – a 40-minute set. We were in tune – which is something that The Lime Spiders weren&#x27;t famous for – and we won. I vaguely remembered Bill Gibson standing at the back of the stage, constantly retuning all the guitars&quot;. – Mather

The recording sessions resulted in a four-track double single, &quot;25th Hour&quot;, released on Green Records in June 1983. &quot;25th Hour&quot; was produced by Rob Younger (ex-Radio Birdman), and included covers of The Haunted&#x27;s &quot;1-2-5&quot; (1966) and Liberty Bell&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s How It Will Be&quot;. The title track was co-written by Blood and Mather, while the final track, &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Long&quot;, was co-written by Blood and Jakimyszyn. Warwick Gilbert (ex-Radio Birdman, Hitmen) played bass guitar for the sessions, because Guest was not confident in his playing. The keyboards were provided by Bruce Tatham (later played with Decline of the Reptiles) who is also heard on The Celibate Rifles&#x27; debut album, &quot;Sideroxylon&quot; (April 1983). Bill Gibson provided backing vocals on two of the tracks.

American punk rockers, Dead Kennedys&#x27; lead singer, Jello Biafra, heard the group while touring in Sydney and he told Murray Engelheart of &quot;Juke Magazine&quot;:&quot;This could be the best time-warp style &#x27;60s garage revival I&#x27;ve ever heard. [They] seem to be more interested in re-creating Sixties garage mania than updating it. I never thought I&#x27;d hear a psychedelic slime band more hard core than Green Fuzz, but here they are&quot;. – Jello Biafra (2 June 1984)

However Lime Spiders fell apart again with Mather leaving before the single had appeared:

&quot;I didn&#x27;t like The Lime Spiders towards the end. I felt we had become heavy and were usurped by what was happening around us. In my eyes we were very much a covers band. I didn&#x27;t see the band going anywhere and I was yearning to become more involved with seriously constructed pop music&quot;. – Mather

The group reformed again by August 1983 with Blood and Jakimyszyn joined by Tony Bambach on bass guitar and Richard Lawson on drums. Both were from The Most, one of their rivals in the Battle of the Bands competition. In March 1984 the new line-up recorded the band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Slave Girl&quot;, which was released in October on Citadel Records. It was co-produced by the band with Tom Misner, who Blood described as &quot;an older dude who owned the School of Audio business (Central Recorders). He warmed immediately to the vibe of the song&quot;. It was co-written by Blood and Jakimyszyn. Blood later told TheDwarf website about writing the track: &quot;[it] come from a throwaway riff that [Jakimyszyn] used to peel off automatically at rehearsals every time he plugged his guitar into his amp, to check his sound ... I asked [him] to keep playin&#x27; the riff, as I thought we could construct a song around it. He looked at me as if I was crazy ... but obligingly cranked his amp &amp; played it with venom, as the band jammed on it for the first time ... I went away with the riff in my head without any lyrics. I woke up one Sat morning at a house I was staying at in [Chippendale] and the lyrics flooded my head and I wrote them down as fast as I was thinking of them ... [later] I came armed with the last verse. I suggested to Jacko that he play something he&#x27;s never done before for the second guitar solo, to take the song to another level. ... [He] blew us away with a searing metal edged freakout before turning around &amp; shyly seeking approval. It was difficult to speak with our mouths agape&quot;.

&quot;Slave Girl&quot; was the number-one independent single in Australia for 1984, it reached the Top 100 Kent Music Report Singles Chart, with over 5,000 copies shipped. The track received airplay in Europe including France, Germany, Spain and Sweden: &quot;where fans in those territories became hooked on its wild acid-punk sound&quot;. In September 1984 the band added Gerard Corben on rhythm guitar (also ex-The Most). The success of &quot;Slave Girl&quot; led to the overseas release of a 12&quot; mini-LP that compiled all six of their recorded tracks as &quot;Slave Girl&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Cook praised the group for &quot;[e]schewing some of the overtly psychedelic &#x27;60s touches and concocting an updated blend of crunching guitars, snarled vocals, and bottom-heavy bass and drums, the band come up with a surprisingly original sound&quot;. In January 1985 Jakimyszyn left the band (after being diagnosed with schizophrenia), and they continued without a replacement. As a four-piece they recorded another single with Younger producing, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, which was released on Citadel in December 1985.

=== The Big Time: &quot;The Cave Comes Alive!&quot; ===
Towards the middle of 1985 Lime Spiders split up again with Blood travelling to Europe as a tourist. Whilst Blood was in Europe, he performed as a guest singer with Swedish band the Pushtwangers (for a single release) and also with a Greek group, Last Drive. The remaining members – Bambach, Corben and Lawson – performed as Adolphus using Mark Green as lead singer. Prior to Blood&#x27;s departure for Europe, the band had an offer to create a track for an in-production feature film, &quot;Young Einstein&quot; (1988). Its producers originally wanted &quot;Slave Girl&quot;, but the song&#x27;s rights were already assigned internationally; so they asked if the group could provide a track that matched its feel. Blood returned to Australian in September 1986 and Lime Spiders reconvened. They released &quot;Weirdo Libido&quot;, which was co-written by Blood and original guitarist Mather and produced by Cameron Allan, as a single, in January 1987 on Virgin Records. It peaked at No. 48 in February. In April its music video was the first one ever shown on &quot;rage&quot;, an Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV music series. The track subsequently appeared on the &quot;Young Einstein&quot; soundtrack.

Jakimyszyn rejoined in May 1987 in time for the release of Lime Spiders&#x27; debut album, &quot;The Cave Comes Alive!&quot; in June. The album was produced by David Price, and peaked at No. 54 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. AllMusic&#x27;s David Szatmary found the album was the &quot;snarling debut from the punk quartet who owe a debt to the &#x27;60s&quot;. Meanwhile, the six-track EP, &quot;Slave Girl&quot;, had reached the top of the United States college chart. It remained there long enough to generate interest in the group. With the release of the album, the band supported The Cult on a national tour. Jakimyszyn left the band again shortly afterwards. At the end of the year they began a North American tour spanning two months of shows in major US cities and several in Canada. The tour included supporting Faith No More and, for the final thirteen shows, supporting Public Image Ltd. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine described them as sounding like &quot;the Sex Pistols on acid&quot;. Highlights included a backstage visit by Iggy Pop and Joey Ramone at the Cat Club in New York.

Blood described the tour:
&quot;The States was a bit frustrating &#x27;cos I felt we could have had a good shot at the title there. We did it in comparative luxury &#x27;cos Virgin underwrote the tour. And we had Motörhead&#x27;s tour bus! Unfortunately we never got back there. We did some shows supporting PiL, and five weeks of our own shows, and there was quite a buzz. There was this place called the Scream Club in LA, this big marble ballroom, and it was early in the tour, second gig or something, and we rocked up to play there and they were lined up around the block and I&#x27;m going, &#x27;Are we at the right place?!&#x27; that&#x27;s when I realised&quot;.

The group then toured Europe, playing at the Roskilde Festival in 1988. Their follow-up album, &quot;Volatile&quot;, with Peter Blyton producing, was released in May that year. It did not receive the same level of critical or commercial acceptance as &quot;The Cave Comes Alive!&quot;. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt that it &quot;contained a decent array of riff-heavy, hard rock tracks, but lacked the raw spark that had characterised the band&#x27;s earlier output&quot;. While Szatmary at AllMusic declared it was &quot;More &#x27;60s-style punk from these Australian rockers&quot;. The same recording sessions also resulted in a four-track 12&quot; extended play, &quot;EP&quot;, which was released in March 1989. By the time &quot;Volatile&quot; had appeared the line-up had changed again: Bambach, Blood, Corben and Lawson were joined by Michael Couvret (ex-Celibate Rifles bass guitarist) on rhythm guitar.

In December 1988 Phil Hall (ex-Sardine v, Dropbears) replaced Bambach on bass guitar and Mark Wilkinson (of The Girlies) replaced Couvret on guitar. This line-up supported Iggy Pop on his January 1989 Australian Instinct tour at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney and at the Newcastle Workers Club – which collapsed later that year in an earthquake. They recorded a cover of The Misunderstood&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; for Timberyard Records&#x27; Christmas compilation &quot;Rockin Bethlehem&quot;. Wilkinson played on the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Fist&quot;, with Kevin Shirley producing, mixed by Michael Brauer, in Los Angeles. Wilkinson left before its release in November 1990. McFarlane described the album as &quot;underrated hard rock&quot;. The track, &quot;Mr Big Mouth&quot;, co-written by Wilkinson and Blood, was released as the B-side of the single from the album, &quot;Cherry Red&quot;, which appeared in October. The band played a promotional show in London at The Marquee Club as a four piece, however, the group disbanded yet again soon after. McFarlane noted that over their career they had provided &quot;raucous sound mixed screaming vocals and wild, fuzz-tone guitar riffs to arrive at a mutant strain of acid punk that bordered on heavy metal&quot;. While John Bush at AllMusic felt they were a &quot;post-punk unit resurrecting the trashier elements of &#x27;60s garage and psychedelic rock with willful abandon&quot;.

=== Reunions and reformations: &quot;Nine Miles High&quot; ===
In 1992 Blood and Hall revived Lime Spiders, with new members Luke Mason on drums; and Jayne Murphy (born Peter Murphy; now singer/guitarist of Flowers For Jayne, 2019 -) on lead guitar. They supported The Black Crowes on their Australian tour in June, but within six months had disbanded again. In 1995 &quot;Slave Girl&quot; was covered by the Goo Goo Dolls on their album, &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;. The Lime Spiders reformed in 1998 with a line-up of Bambach, Blood, Corben, Lawson, and a new guitarist, Dave Sparks.

In September 2002 a compilation album, &quot;Nine Miles High&quot;, was released by Raven Records/EMI Records, it comprised 26 tracks, including rare B-sides and EP cuts, as well as a twelve-page booklet outlining the band&#x27;s history, which was followed by the first tour of the band in five years. In 2004 the band played a single performance as special guests to the Detroit group, MC5.
The band then reformed again for an exclusive show at the Annandale Hotel in May 2006. The line-up featured the return of early guitarist, Jakimyszyn. The Lime Spiders again reformed in the following year, with the line-up of Blood, Corben, Hall, Lawson, and Sparks. They toured nationally in November to coincide with the release of their next album, &quot;Live at The Esplanade&quot;, recordings of a live performance made ten years earlier on 25 January 1997 at The Esplanade Hotel, Melbourne. The performance had been recorded after Blood discovered the venue had an in-house 24-track recording system shortly before they were due to perform. It is essentially a greatest hits live collection, although it includes two previously unreleased tracks, &quot;Society of Soul&quot; and &quot;The Dead Boys&quot;.

Lime Spiders reformed again in December 2008 for three shows at the Harp Hotel in Wollongong, Manly Fisherman&#x27;s Club, and the Annandale Hotel. Bambach returned, while Tom Corben, the son of Gerard Corben, replaced Lawson on drums. The next line-up of Blood, Bambach, Gerard and Tom Corben, and Sparks, reconvened for an appearance at the Hoodoo Gurus&#x27; Dig It Up show in Sydney during 2013. Their track, &quot;Slave Girl&quot; appeared as the theme for ABC-TV&#x27;s, &quot;Paper Giants: Magazine Wars&quot;, in June that year.

Mick Blood suffered a brain injury in a pub fight in 2014. The band reformed without him for a one-off benefit show in Sydney on 23 September with a number of guest vocalists, and Celibate Rifles, the Psychotic Turnbuckles, one-time backing vocalist Bill Gibson&#x27;s band Hey! Charger and an unplugged Dubrovniks among the supports.

In November 2015, the band announced it would play another benefit show at Sydney&#x27;s Bald Faced Stag Hotel on 23 January 2016 with singer/actor Ripley Hood (Mushroom Planet, Funhouse, The Four Stooges) on vocals as Blood was still not well enough to perform. This show was cancelled several days later after objections from Blood.

In June 2023, Mick Blood has announced the end of Lime Spiders, as he can no longer enjoy existing in music with the intense scrutiny of social media. saying &quot;As you may realise, I&#x27;ve finally given up the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll circus after a highly successful international career with the Lime Spiders, the band I formed 43 years ago. I no longer enjoyed the intense scrutiny, made worse these days by &#x27;social&#x27; media. Random people posting dodgy footage taken on a phone &amp; hurtful comments from online trolls were the last straw. The music scene isn&#x27;t as immediate &amp; real as it was back in the day, providing a perfect outlet for these cowardly types.&quot;

<doc id="796765" wikidata="Q1190077" url="?curid=796765" title="Snowbelt">
<text>The Snowbelt, Snow Belt, Frostbelt, or Frost Belt is the region near the Great Lakes in North America where heavy snowfall in the form of lake-effect snow is particularly common. Snowbelts are typically found downwind of the lakes, principally off the eastern and southern shores. 

==Cause==
Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air moves over warmer water, taking up moisture that later precipitates as snow when the air moves over land and cools. The lakes produce snowsqualls and persistently cloudy skies throughout the winter, as long as air temperatures are colder than water temperatures, or until a lake freezes over.

==Location==
In the United States, snowbelts are located southeast of Lake Erie from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York, and south of Lake Ontario stretching roughly from Rochester, New York, over Syracuse, New York, to Utica, New York, and northward to Watertown, New York. Other snowbelts are located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan from Gary, Indiana, northward through Western Michigan and Northern Michigan to the Straits of Mackinac, and on the eastern and southern shores of Lake Superior from northwest Wisconsin through the northern half of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Portions of the snowbelt are located in Ontario, Canada, which includes the eastern shore of Lake Superior from Sault Ste. Marie northward to Wawa, as well as the eastern and southern shores of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay from Parry Sound to London. During the winter, north-westerly winds cause frequent road closures, with Highway 21 on the Lake Huron coast and Highway 26 south of Georgian Bay as far east as Barrie, Ontario, being strongly affected. The Niagara Peninsula and the north-eastern shores of Lake Ontario are especially hard-hit by heavy snowfall when south-western winds are predominant.

Lake Erie is the second smallest of the five Great Lakes and shallowest. It can completely freeze over during winter. Once frozen, lake-effect snow over land to the east and south of Lake Erie is temporarily alleviated. This does not end the possibility of a damaging winter storm. The Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977 that struck metropolitan Buffalo was a direct result of powder snow blown by high winds off Lake Erie, which had frozen earlier than normal. There was, for the region, no significant snowfall during the duration of the blizzard.

The southern and southeastern sides of the Great Salt Lake in Utah receive significant lake-effect snow. Since the Great Salt Lake never freezes, the lake effect can influence the weather along the Wasatch Front year-round. The lake effect largely contributes to the 55–80 inches (140–203 cm) annual snowfall amounts recorded south and east of the lake, and an average snowfall reaching 500 inches (13 m) in the Wasatch Range. The snow, which is often very light and dry because of the semiarid climate, is referred to as the &quot;Greatest Snow on Earth&quot; in the mountains. Lake-effect snow contributes to roughly six to eight snowfalls per year in Salt Lake City, with about 10% of the city&#x27;s precipitation being contributed by the phenomenon.

==Effects of climate change==
Climate change will likely have a significant effect on the future of weather events on the snowbelt. On one hand, as temperatures increase in the area of the Great Lakes, making them free of ice for longer periods of time, snowfall could increase during lake-effect snow events and extend lake-effect snow season if the air is cold enough for snow. However the air that flows over the rivers and can create lake-effect snow will also generally become warmer over time which could lead to less overall snow and more overall lake-effect rain. The second effect will more likely affect southern lake effect regions faster as they will warm up quicker due to their more southern location.

==Skiing industries==
Healthy skiing industries have been established in snowbelt regions located near major cities such as Buffalo and Toronto. The Erie/Ontario snowbelt, which extends to the northern slopes of the Allegheny Plateau, has lent the region its nickname: ski country. To the south of Georgian Bay, ski resorts are found on the Niagara Escarpment at Blue Mountain and on the Oro Moraine.

==Outside North America==
Ocean-effect snow conditions are found on the West side of the Japanese island of Hokkaido and the west side of Russia&#x27;s Kamchatka Peninsula. There, cold winds blowing outward from the Siberian winter high pressure system pick up moisture while crossing the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk and release it as heavy snowfall in Japan&#x27;s snow country. 

Sweden&#x27;s east coast can be affected by similar conditions, particularly in the early winter when there is little ice on the Baltic Sea.

<text>Pelmeni (, ; pelmen, , ) are dumplings of Russian cuisine that consist of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened dough. They are considered to be a national dish.

Pelmeni became a staple of Russian cuisine during the period of Russian expansion into the Ural Mountains and Siberia. Pelmeni also have deep roots in the traditions and folklore of the Komi region of northwest Russia and figure prominently in Komi cuisine. The name itself was borrowed from the language of the Komi-Permyaks.

==Description==
The dough is made from flour and water, sometimes adding a small portion of eggs.

Pelmeni can be served in several ways; for example, they can be cooked in stock, or they can be cooked &quot;consommé&quot; and served in a bowl with soup. Pelmeni can be served as a main dish for lunch or dinner, either smothered in butter or prepared Siberian-style, which involves sprinkling them with vinegar and adding freshly ground pepper for extra flavor.

The filling can be minced meat (pork, lamb, beef, fish or any other kind of meat, venison being particularly traditional for colder regions) or mushrooms, or a combination of the two. The mixing together of different kinds of meat is also popular. In European Russia, ground beef is used and mushroom-filled pelmeni are also accepted. The traditional Udmurt recipe requires a mixture of 45% beef, 35% mutton, and 20% pork. Various spices, such as black pepper and diced onions as well as garlic, are mixed into the filling. They are commonly topped with sour cream, mayonnaise, dill, red onions or vinegar, all of which are traditional to the region and can be produced in the Siberian climate.

Adding small amounts of cabbage, tomato and horseradish into the mince is also common for certain regional recipes.

Temperature and humidity have considerable impact on dough consistency and stability.

===Similar dishes===

Pelmeni belong to the family of dumplings, and are related to Ukrainian and Polish &quot;uszka&quot;.

In the United States and Canada, the term &quot;pierogi&quot; or &quot;perogies&quot; is often used to describe all kinds of Eastern European dumplings, regardless of the shape, size, or filling. Pelmeni are also similar to Mongolian &quot;bansh&quot;, Chinese &quot;jiaozi&quot; (Cantonese &quot;gaau&quot;) or Chinese &quot;húntún&quot; (Cantonese wonton). They are cousins to the Armenian, Turkish and Kazakh &quot;manti&quot;, the Georgian &quot;khinkali&quot;, the Nepalese and Tibetan &quot;momo&quot;, the Uyghur and Uzbek &quot;chuchvara&quot;, the Korean &quot;mandu&quot;, the Japanese &quot;gyoza&quot;, the Italian &quot;tortellini&quot; and &quot;ravioli&quot;, and Swabian &quot;Maultaschen&quot;. Somewhat similar are the fried or baked &quot;empanadas&quot; encountered in Hispanic-influenced cultures.

The most important difference between pelmeni, &quot;varenyky&quot;, and &quot;pierogi&quot; is the thickness of the dough shell—in pelmeni and vareniki this is as thin as possible, and the proportion of filling to dough is usually higher. Pelmeni are never served with a sweet filling, which distinguishes them from &quot;vareniki&quot; and Polish &quot;pierogi&quot;, which sometimes are. Also, the fillings in pelmeni are usually raw, while the fillings of &quot;vareniki&quot; and &quot;pierogi&quot; are typically precooked.

The main difference between pelmeni and momos is their size—a typical pelmen is about in diameter, whereas momos are often at least twice that size.

===Regional differences===

In Siberia, pelmeni are traditionally frozen outdoors in the winter and treated as preserved food. Hunters or explorers heading into the taiga would carry sacks of frozen pelmeni with their provisions since they can be stored frozen for a long time and are easily cooked.

Pelmeni are prepared immediately before eating by boiling in salted water until they float, and then two to five minutes more. In the Urals, they are boiled in plain water, while in Siberia they are boiled in salted water or sometimes meat or chicken broth. The cooked pelmeni are served alone or topped with melted butter or smetana (sour cream), as well as condiments like mustard, horseradish, tomato sauce, and vinegar. In the Russian Far East, they generally add soy sauce.

There are many traditional recipes, some of them suggest frying pelmeni after boiling until they turn golden brown. Pelmeni can also be served in a clear soup, although in Siberia this is considered in poor taste and pelmeni are carefully strained before serving. In Tatar cuisine, &quot;pilmän&quot; (the Tatar equivalent of pelmeni) are a traditional dish, where they have always been served with clear soup and added dill or other freshly cut herbs. Pelmeni are also part of Polish cuisine.

Packed frozen, pelmeni can be found in ethnic Russian and Ukrainian food stores everywhere. Packets of frozen pelmeni, like those carried on the taiga, are usually labeled &quot;Siberian pelmeni&quot;. Store-bought pelmeni are made on industrial machinery, much of which is made by Italian companies such as Arienti and Cattaneo, Ima, Ostoni, Zamboni, etc. These pelmeni usually weigh around each and look like a larger version of tortellini, which is why, for industrial production, Italian pasta machines are commonly used. Pelmeni are also commonly made at home. The easiest (if somewhat laborious) way is simply to make them by hand; many cooks use specialized &quot;pelmeni makers&quot; (, &quot;pelmennitsa&quot;), which are essentially molds that resemble muffin pans or ravioli molds, allowing one to quickly make a few dozen pelmeni out of two sheets of dough and a quantity of ground meat.

In Russia, store-bought pelmeni are considered a kind of convenience food associated with students&#x27; or bachelors&#x27; lifestyles, much like instant ramen in the West, while home-made pelmeni are considered hearty, healthy food. Store-bought frozen pelmeni, including those catered for the Russian émigré community, are therefore only remotely related and fail to capture the qualities of the original dish.

==History==
The word &quot;pelmeni&quot; is derived from &quot;pel&#x27;n&#x27;an″&quot; (пельнянь), literally &quot;ear bread&quot; in the Finno-Ugric Komi and Udmurt languages. Alternatively, it is literally translated as &quot;dough ears&quot;.

The origins of pelmeni are contested, but they are widely viewed as a Siberian contribution to Russian cuisine. One theory suggests pelmeni, or stuffed boiled dumplings in general, originated in Siberia, possibly a simplified adaptation of the Chinese jiaozi (in some dialects it is called Bāomiàn &quot;包麵/包面&quot;). This theory is corroborated by the fact that traditional pelmeni fillings are strongly flavored with black pepper and other spices that are not native to Russia. Therefore, pelmeni may have been carried by the Mongols from China to Siberia and the Urals. Another theory is that they originated in the Urals and were then spread to Central Asia by Russian explorers and pioneers. Pelmeni may have also been developed by hunters, who needed food that was light and easy to prepare in order to be able to take with them on hunting trips.

Pelmeni began to appear in restaurants in late 19th-century France at a time when Russian dishes had already made a considerable impact on &quot;haute cuisine&quot;. Auguste Escoffier included them as a hot hors d&#x27;oeuvre in &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot;, which was contrary to the Russian custom.

<text>William Timothy Callahan (born April 11, 1964) is an American former professional football defensive back who played for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Pittsburgh Panthers while at University of Pittsburgh.

Callahan switched from a running back to his best known position as a defensive back in 1983, after a suggestion from his coach Joe Naunchik, although many did not initially understand his choice to change position. Callahan became the starting favourite in that position after his predecessor Ray Weatherspoon was dropped following an altercation.

In 1986, he was favourably compared to Tom Flynn and was described by &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; as being &quot;one of the brightest young safeties in the NFL&quot;. He was recorded as running the -dash in 4.48 seconds, making him among the fastest safeties playing at that time. His time was comparable to then top-rated safety Craig Swoope, who did the same run in 4.57 seconds.

<text>The University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) is a public university in Edmond, Oklahoma, United States. It is the third largest university in Oklahoma, with almost 13,000 students and approximately 430 full-time and 400 adjunct faculty. Founded in 1890, the University of Central Oklahoma was one of the first institutions of higher learning to be established in what would become the state of Oklahoma, making it one of the oldest universities in the southwest region of the United States. It is home to the American branch of the British Academy of Contemporary Music in downtown Oklahoma City.

==History==
The University of Central Oklahoma was founded on December 24, 1890, when the Territorial Legislature voted to establish the Territorial Normal School, making UCO the second oldest public institution in Oklahoma, the first being the University of Oklahoma, established December 19, 1890. Classes were first held in November 1891. By comparison, Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University) held its first classes in December 1891 and the University of Oklahoma began its first classes in fall 1892.

The Territorial Legislature located the new school in Edmond, provided certain conditions were met. First, Oklahoma County had to donate $5,000 in bonds, and Edmond had to donate of land within one mile (1.6 km) of the town; the land was eventually donated by Anton H. Classen. Ten of those acres had to be set aside for the new school. The remaining land had to be divided into lots which would be sold to raise money for the new school. On October 1, 1891 Richard Thatcher was elected the 1st President of Territorial Normal School of Oklahoma.

The conditions all were met, with the city of Edmond donating an additional $2,000 in bonds. The first class, a group of 23 students, met for the first time November 1, 1891, in the Epworth League Room, located in the unfurnished First Methodist Church. A marker of Oklahoma granite was placed in 1915 near the original site by the Central Oklahoma Normal School Historical Society. It can be seen at Boulevard and Second Street.

Old North was the first building constructed in the summer of 1892 on the campus of what was then Territorial Normal School. It was also the first building constructed in Oklahoma Territory for the purpose of higher education. Occupancy began January 3, 1893. The school first operated as a normal school with two years of college work and a complete preparatory school. In 1897, the first graduating class—two men and three women—received their Normal School diplomas.

In 1904, Territorial Normal became Central State Normal School. On December 29, 1919, the State Board of Education passed a resolution making Central a four-year teachers’ college conferring bachelor&#x27;s degrees. From 1901 until 1961, Central housed a laboratory school in which local elementary schoolchildren were schooled by Central&#x27;s faculty and soon-to-be teaching graduates.

Two years later, the Class of 1921 had nine members, the first graduates to receive the four-year degrees. Two decades later, in 1939, the Oklahoma Legislature authorized the institution to grant both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. With the expanded offerings came a new name, Central State College.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the school was routinely affected by state politics. Presidents and sometimes faculty members, were changed with changes in state governors. In 1950, President Max W. Chambers banned solicitations of campaign donations from faculty members. This resulted in more stability of the school administration.

On March 11, 1941, Central State became part of a coordinated state system of post-secondary education overseen by the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education, and joined institutions with similar missions as a regional institution.

In 1954, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education gave Central permission to offer the Master of Teaching Degree, which became the Master of Education in 1969. In 1971, the college was authorized to grant the Master of Arts in English and the Master of Business Administration degrees.

On April 13, 1971, the state legislature officially changed the institution&#x27;s name to Central State University. Old North Tower was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.
On May 18, 1990, during the university&#x27;s Centennial Year, legislation was passed changing the name to the University of Central Oklahoma, though many of the students still refer to the University as &quot;Central&quot;, and many alumni as &quot;Central State.&quot;

=== Motto and coat of arms ===
The University of Central Oklahoma’s official coat of arms was created in 1966, when yearbook student editor Dorthy Forbes wanted to feature the visual design in the 75th anniversary of the Central State University yearbook. When Forbes discovered there was no official coat of arms, four students serving on the yearbook staff, Donna Castle, Charles Tweed, Russ Lackey, and Forbes professionally designed a coat of arms and presented it to President Garland Godfrey, who approved the submission. Since then, the coat of arms has been featured on statues and other structures around Central’s campus, official Central stationery and graduation announcements, and is highlighted in the Office of the President.

The University of Central Oklahoma’s motto, featured on the coat of arms, is “Ubi Motus Est,” which translates to “Where Movement Is.” The students modeled the phrase after a popular television series in the 60s titled “Where the Action Is.”

<text>Edward Powys Mathers (28 August 1892 – 3 February 1939) was an English translator and poet, and also a pioneer of compiling advanced cryptic crosswords. Powys Mathers was born in Forest Hill, London, the son of Edward Peter Mathers, newspaper proprietor. He was educated at Loretto School and Trinity College, Oxford.

He translated J. C. Mardrus&#x27;s French version of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. His English version of Mardrus appeared in 1923, and is known as Mardrus/Mathers. He also translated &quot;The Garden of Bright Waters: One Hundred and Twenty Asiatic Love Poems&quot; (1920); and the Kashmiri poet Bilhana in &quot;Bilhana: Black Marigolds&quot; (1919), a free interpretation in the tradition of Edward FitzGerald, quoted at length in John Steinbeck’s novel &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. These are not scholarly works, and are in some cases based on intermediate versions in European languages. Some of his translations were set to music by Aaron Copland.

He was also a composer of cryptic crosswords for &quot;The Observer&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Torquemada&quot; from 1926 until his death. He was the author of &quot;Crosswords for Riper Years&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Torquemada Puzzle Book&quot; (1934), which included the murder mystery puzzle &quot;Cain&#x27;s Jawbone&quot;. Under this pseudonym, he reviewed detective stories from 1934 to 1939.

In 1919 he married Rosamond Crowdy (5 July 1886 – 7 June 1965), third daughter of Colonel H. Crowdy, RE.

He died in his sleep at his home in Hampstead.

<text>King George is an elevated station on the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver&#x27;s SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located in the south end of the Surrey City Centre district of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, and is one of the outbound termini of the Expo Line, the other being Production Way–University station. The station is located on King George Boulevard at Holland Commons, just north of Fraser Highway.

The station is within walking distance to Holland Park and Surrey Memorial Hospital. A number of mixed-use developments continue to be built near the station, such as the King George Hub development, which displaced the park and ride facility that had once served the station.

==History==
King George station was opened in 1994 as part of the second extension of the Expo Line into Surrey; the other stations included on this extension were Gateway and Surrey Central. The station is named for nearby King George Boulevard, which in turn is named after King George VI, who visited the municipality of Surrey in 1939.

Since opening in 1994, it has served as an outbound terminus of the Expo Line. The tracks continue beyond the station for about a block before they terminate and are used to store extra cars and to allow outbound trains to switch tracks for their ensuing inbound runs; plans call for the line to be extended deeper into Surrey, following Fraser Highway.

In 2022, an Expo Line extension from King George station to 203 Street in Langley City was approved. Construction on the extension was scheduled to begin in 2024 and be completed by 2029.

Between April 27 and June 9, 2024, King George station was temporarily closed to allow for replacement work on two switches and a section of third rail between King George and Surrey Central stations. During this time, various repairs and upgrades were completed on the station, including platform work to accommodate Alstom Mark V trainsets.

<doc id="796788" wikidata="Q1908398" url="?curid=796788" title="Mathew Baker (shipwright)">
<text>Mathew Baker (1530–1613) was one of the most renowned Tudor shipwrights, and the first to put the practice of shipbuilding down on paper.

The first list of &#x27;Master Shipwrights&#x27; appointed &#x27;by Patent&#x27; by Henry VIII of England included &#x27;John Smyth, Robert Holborn, Richard Bull and James Baker,&#x27; in 1537. James Baker was responsible for many of the designs and the construction of King Henry&#x27;s fleet. James designed the means of mounting cannon in a ship&#x27;s lower levels, rather than on the top deck, an idea credited to King Henry.

Having been apprenticed to his father James, and having grown up in the surroundings of the dockyard, Mathew was appointed &#x27;Master Shipwright&#x27; in 1572. As John Hawkins&#x27;s reformed naval administration began to bring discipline to the craft of shipbuilding, Mathew Baker became perhaps the greatest ship designer of Tudor times, known to have built, among other ships, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the &quot;Vanguard&quot;, the &quot;Merhonour&quot; and the &quot;Repulse&quot;.

==Advances in ship design==
Known to dislike his rival Phineas Pett, Mathew Baker competed to become the chief engineer of Elizabeth I&#x27;s navy. His success was achieved when he became the first known shipwright to develop the practice of &#x27;laying down the lines&#x27; for a ship, not, as was traditional, at the site of construction, but on paper. Thus, scale models were no longer the only means of understanding the secret lore of the shipwright and it became possible to discuss and modify the plans with the patron.

Few shipbuilding treatises survive from the fifteenth century, and all these are Italian. Mathew Baker authored the earliest detailed English treatise on ship design.

Peter Pett I and Mathew Baker were both at Deptford when a new design of oceanic type of warship was launched in 1575. &quot;Revenge&quot; represented a departure from anything designed before. This was the origin of the &#x27;Sailing Ship of the Line&#x27;, the design that heralded the future British mastery of the seas. &quot;Revenge&quot;, while not a giant at 500 tons, was fast and dangerous. Heavily armed, its chief advantage was that it could remain at sea for long periods and was easily manoeuvrable against an aggressor.

==Rivalry with the Pett dynasty==
There is reason to believe that Mathew Baker may have been raised in the household of Peter Pett, who was associated from 1570 with the shipworks at Dover. The son of Peter Pett, Phineas, and his son, Peter, both endured the ill will of those in the boat building fraternity who, spurred by jealousy, wished to see the Pett shipwright dynasty fall. Mathew Baker and Phineas Pett quarrelled and, according to Pett, over the next ten to twelve years, Baker lost no opportunity of &#x27;doing him a bad turn&#x27;. This seems to be borne out by Baker&#x27;s own comments. 
Phineas Pett, a free radical among the established Master Shipwrights, took the bold initiative of sweeping aside Mathew Baker&#x27;s grand principles of &#x27;Shipwrightry&#x27;. The other shipwrights saw him as a dangerous upstart and made several unsuccessful attempts to thwart his advancement. However, Phineas Pett eventually became the subject of an enquiry in 1621 so serious that King James was forced to intervene. Stern criticism had been levelled against Pett by members of the Navy Commission, led by Burrell. At the behest of Mathew Baker, a party of &#x27;diverse Master Shipwrights&#x27; of the Thames complained that Pett, amongst other outrages, was found employing the practice of &#x27;furring&#x27; to broaden the width of the &quot;Prince Royal.&quot; They alleged he had misjudged the calculated width under Baker&#x27;s system. He had, in fact, introduced modifications into the methods of Baker and the older shipwrights, such as his adjustments of the width of the floor and the shape of the bows.

Perrin, in his introduction to Pett&#x27;s autobiography, explains that &quot;this indictment cannot be lightly set aside. Mathew Baker was the most prominent shipbuilder of that day, Bright and Richard Meryett (or Meritt) were Government Shipbuilders of long experience, while Nicholas Clay, John Greaves and Edward Stevens were private builders of considerable standing in their profession.&quot; These men sided with Baker on who was competent to undertake the refit of the &quot;Prince Royal&quot; built under Pett. Pett&#x27;s own reference to this matter in his autobiography is &quot;touching the cross-grained timber, his Majesty protested very earnestly the cross grain was in the men and not in the timber!&quot;.

Thus, having &quot;maliciously certified the ship unserviceable and not fit to be continued [by] the 24th of February succeeding, by special command from His Majesty, who well understood their malicious proceedings, the selfsame surveyors were again sent to Chatham and under their hands certified that the ship might be made serviceable for a voyage into Spain with the charge of £300/~ to be bestowed upon her hull and the perfecting her masts, which certificate was returned under their hands and delivered to His Majesty.&quot; The &quot;Prince Royal&quot; was brought to the docks at Chatham on 8 March 1623 and re-launched a fortnight later.

<text>The Norwegian Guide and Scout Association (, NSF) is a Norwegian Scouting and Guiding association founded in its present form in 1978, when the &quot;Norwegian Boy Scout Organization&quot; (founded in 1911 and among the charter members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922) and the &quot;Norwegian Girl Guide Organization&quot; (founded in 1921 and an early member of World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts) merged.

NSF is a member of Speidernes Fellesorganisasjon, the national Scouting and Guiding federation of Norway. NSF is also a member of WOSM and WAGGGS.

==Program==
===Purpose===
Scouting&#x27;s main purpose is to develop young members into independent, self sufficient and responsible adults. This is achieved using a training program with outdoor recreation and practical activities, teamwork in small groups (patrol system), and by actively using the &quot;learning by doing&quot; method.

===Themes===
Program of the Norges speiderforbund is structured into five themes:

*Outdoor Life
*Creativity 
*Friendships 
*Community Involvement 
*Life quality

The program is structured to provide members with progression to continually meet new challenges. The methods are very much based on practical aspects and mastery over theory. As might be expected in Norway, outdoor activities is emphasized, with much of the program centered around classical themes like first aid, camping, pioneering, field cooking, woodcraft and hiking.

===Age structure===
To be adapted to the individual member&#x27;s level of development, the program is divided up into age groups by grade (division varies):

*Beavers – ages 6 to 8
*Cubs/Brownies – ages 8 to 10
*Scouts/Guides – ages 10 to 16
*Rovers – ages 16 to 24

==History==
===The start of boy scouting===
Thanks to Norway&#x27;s economical and constitutional ties to Britain, Norway was among the early nations where scouting emerged. The first scouting activity took place in 1909, and in 1910, the 1st Christiania Scout group was established in the then named Christiania (later Oslo) as Norway&#x27;s first official Scout group. In early 1911 the 2nd Christiania was founded. These two initial scout troops founded the Norwegian Boy-Scout association (Norsk Speidergutt-Forbund) in February of the same year, marking the official beginning of the Scout Movement in Norway.

===Girl Guides in Norway===
In 1916, the head of the Danish Girl Guides (Dansk Pikespejerforbund) was invited by Queen Maud to Christiania to give a lecture on girl guiding. This resulted in a working committee to establish scouting for girls, but an association failed to form. The Norwegian branch of YWCA had however taken up the challenge, starting several scouting groups for girls. On 3 November 1920, a number of these groups formed the Norwegian YWCA-scouts (Norges KFUK-speidere). The association&#x27;s oldest squad, Trondheim 1 had been established back in 1915 in Trondheim.

Girl scouting groups had however emerged in Norway in connection to the established boy-scout groups, well before the initiative by the Queen. An article on boy scouting in Stavanger Aftenblad from back in 1910 stated that scout work has already spread to the girls. These independent girl scouting groups eventually merged into the Norwegian girl scouts association (Norsk Speiderpikeforbund). The official foundation date was set to 1 July 1921.

===Later development===
In 1922, the Norwegian scouting associations gained recognition by the World Bureau in 1922, as a founding member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. Several religious associations like the YMCA, Methodist Church and Salvation Army started their own scouting groups.

During the Second World War Norway was occupied, and with their international ties and obvious militarily useful skills, the collaborator government fared the scouts could become a center for resistance work. All forms of scouting were banned in September 1941. The funds, equipment, banners and even uniform details were to be turned over to authorities. Scout leaders spirited away what they could, but many groups lost much of their equipment and funds. The youth wing of collaborator political party Nasjonal Samling was the only allowed scout-like activity allowed. After the war, scouting was quickly taken up again.

The 14th World Scout Jamboree in 1975 took place in Norway.

On April 23, 1978 unit Norsk Speidergutt-Forbund (NSF) og Norsk Speiderpikeforbund (NSPF) merged to form the Norges speiderforbund (NSF) for both girls and boys, while the YMCA/YWCA, Methodist and Salvation Army groups elected to remain separate, though they often participate and cooperate with the NSF-groups and participate in their jamborees.

In 1985, Dr. Gisle Johnson was awarded the &quot;Bronze Wolf&quot;, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.

===Adjusting the religious aspect===
In its original form, Christianity was a central pillar of scouting. Both the Scout law and Scout pledge reflect this. All members organizations of the World Organization of the Scout Movement are required to have a spiritual aspect. As the association viewed itself as a Christian organization based on Christian values, several non-religious groups applying for membership in the Norwegian Guide and Scout Association had been rejected.

With an increasingly secular society and rising number of immigrant youth with religious background other than Christianity in post-war Norway, the 1st paragraph of the Norwegian Scouts law requiring Christian faith became contentious. It was rewritten in 1978 to a non-denominational &quot;A Scout is open to God and His Word&quot;, but this too was seen as excluding for the increasingly non-religious member mass. Based on changes to the British Girl Guide pledge a few years earlier, the paragraph was changed again in 2016, to &quot;A scout will seek their own belief, and respect that of others&quot;. In 2018 the scouts pledge was changed accordingly.

==Structure==
, NSF had 18,500 members, organised in 29 districts and 6 corps with 450 local groups.

==Activities==

The main activities of the Norges speiderforbund takes place in work units (see age groups above) in Scout groups. The meetings are regular, often weekly, and with several trips a year. Most Scout groups offer their members a camp of about one week&#x27;s duration each summer.

NSF also have some events on the regional and federation level. At the federal level there&#x27;s national jamboree, held every four years. The last Norwegian national Jamboree was held in Bodø in 2017, as the 2021 national Jamboree could not be held due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At an international level, NSF along with Norges KFUK-KFUM-speidere are due to host Roverway in 2024. The motto of this event is ‘North of the Ordinary’.

Regional competitions are where patrols compete in Scouting skills. The best patrols in each region qualify for the Norwegian Scouting Championships. Each national Scouting championship and region banner competition lasts a weekend. Some typical exercises during these events are the orienteering, the pioneering, circular track with nature study, citizenship and first aid.

As part of the Norges Speiderforbund of Community Involvement, the Scout campaign has been held every year since 2004. This is a fundraiser that goes to NRC projects.

NSF is divided up into 29 circuits. Groups include members of the same circuit. The circles are the link between the Federation and groups.

<text>Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland, 1st Baronet (8 May 1735 – 15 October 1811) was an English painter and politician.

==Early life==
The third son of architect George Dance the Elder, Dance (he added the &#x27;Holland&#x27; suffix later in life) studied art under Francis Hayman, and like many contemporaries also studied in Italy. There he met Angelica Kauffman and painted several historic and classical paintings.

==Career==
On his return to Britain, he became a successful portrait painter. With Hayman and his architect brother, George, he was one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768.
He was commissioned to paint King George III and his queen, plus Captain James Cook and actor David Garrick. His group portrait &quot;The Pybus Family&quot; (1769) is in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.

In 1790, he gave up his artistic career and became Member of Parliament for East Grinstead in Sussex. He served this seat until 1802 when he moved to Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, serving until 1806.

In 1807 he moved back to East Grinstead, serving until he died in 1811. He was made a baronet in 1800, which became extinct upon death.

==Family==

He was married to Harriet, the daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet and the widow of Thomas Dummer, for whom his brother had designed the house at Cranbury Park, near Winchester. They lived at Little Wittenham Manor in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). His wife survived him until 1825. His nephew, Sir Nathaniel Dance, was an East India Company officer famous for his actions at the naval Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804.

<text>Joseph Charles Mardrus, otherwise known as &quot;Jean-Charles Mardrus&quot; (1868–1949), was a French physician, poet, and a noted translator. Today he is best known for his translation of the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; from Arabic into French, which was published from 1898 to 1904, and was in turn rendered into English by Edward Powys Mathers. A newer edition, &quot;Le livre des mille nuits et une nuit&quot;, was published in 1926–1932.

== Biography ==
Mardrus was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1868 to a Catholic family of Armenian-descent, and studied in Lebanon before settling in Paris, France.

As a doctor for the French government, he worked throughout Morocco and the Far East. He produced other translations, some illustrated by the Swiss engraver François-Louis Schmied (1873–1941). He married the novelist and poet Lucie Delarue-Mardrus on 5 June 1900. In 1914 he met Gabrielle Bralant (&quot;Cobrette&quot;), whom he would later marry, and he and Lucie separated in the following year.

Elvira Buder (born 1918) claimed to have travelled from Egypt via Greece with Mardrus in the 1930s with the intention of attending the Sorbonne. Soon after arriving in Paris war broke out and she found herself pregnant and in France on an Italian passport. Buder left France for Italy when the Germans occupied Paris, although she claimed that Mardrus was not the father of her child. Much later they met for the last time when Buder had just married E.W.N. Mallows, son of C.E. Mallows Charles Edward Mallows. Mardrus was a friend of Louis Aragon and introduced Buder to him.

<text>At the time of Queen Elizabeth I, Richard Chapman (born c. 1520, and died c.1592) was the owner of a private shipyard at Deptford, had the title of &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Master Shipwright,&#x27; and had been involved in the construction of river defences along the Thames, along with Peter Pett and Mathew Baker, two other important shipwrights of the time. Chapman was Master Shipwright of Woolwich and Deptford and built the first &quot;Ark Royal&quot; (initially ordered as a private venture as the &quot;Ark Ralegh&quot;, but taken over for the Queen while still on the stocks).

Chapman&#x27;s father, John, was also a Master Shipwright and he also had strong ties to the important shipbuilding family, the Petts as his mother was Ann Pett and he was raised in the Pett household. The Chapman family itself, however, included several mariners whose origins appear to be in Devon and shipwrights who lived at Greenwich, working at this craft since the reign of the King Edward Ist (1239–1307).

Richard&#x27;s son, Edmund Chapman, became &#x27;Chief Joiner&#x27; to the Queen and owned significant property in Greenwich. Edmund provided land for the almshouses named &#x27;Queen Elizabeth College&#x27;, founded in 1574, and himself lived at &#x27;Swanne House.&#x27;

The Södermalm district covers the island of the same name (formerly called &quot;Åsön&quot;), which, however, is not fully separated from the peninsula of Södertörn (or the rest of the Swedish mainland), as water to both its north and south does not flow freely but passes through a lock and a man-made waterway.

Södermalm is connected to its surrounding areas by a number of bridges. It connects to Gamla stan to the north by Slussen, a grid of road and rail and a lock separating the lake Mälaren from the Baltic Sea, to Långholmen to the northwest by one of the city&#x27;s larger bridges, Västerbron, to the islet Reimersholme to the west, to Liljeholmen to the southwest by the bridge Liljeholmsbron, to Årsta by Årstabron and Skansbron, to Johanneshov by Johanneshovsbron and Skanstullsbron to the south, and, finally, to Södra Hammarbyhamnen to the east by Danvikstull Bridge.

Administratively, Södermalm is part of Stockholm Municipality. It constitutes, together with Gamla stan and some other districts, from 2007 the administrative district &quot;Södermalms stadsdelsområde&quot;, often translated as Södermalm borough.

==History==

The name Södermalm (as &quot;Suthaermalm&quot;) is first mentioned in 1288 in a letter from Bishop Anund of Strängnäs. Until the early 17th century Södermalm was mainly a rural, agricultural area. Its first urban areas were planned and built in the mid 17th century, comprising a mixture of working class housing, such as the little red cottages of which a few can still be seen in northeastern Södermalm, and the summer houses and pavilions of wealthier families, such as Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s pavilion, which is now in the outdoor museum Skansen. During this time, it was also the location of perhaps the first theatre in Scandinavia, Björngårdsteatern. Södermalm is often poetically named &quot;Söders höjder&quot; (&quot;heights of the south&quot;), which reflects its topography of sheer cliffs and rocky hills. Indeed, the hills of Södermalm provide remarkable views of Stockholm&#x27;s skyline.

In the 18th century, the working-class cottages that clung to Mariaberget, the steep cliffs facing Riddarfjärden, were replaced by the large buildings that are still present today. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that urbanization grasped the entire width of Södermalm, and even today parts of Södermalm have a rural feeling to them, as for instance the landscape of tiny allotments that climb the slopes of Eriksdal.

Södermalm was once known as the &quot;slum&quot; area of Stockholm. However today, Södermalm is known as the home of bohemian, alternative culture and a broad range of cultural amenities. Meanwhile, the growing demand for housing, as well as an increasing gentrification of Stockholm&#x27;s central parts, makes apartments in Södermalm more and more difficult or expensive to come by. Thus what was once a working-class district is now somewhat a district of the privileged.

==Geography==

===Neighbourhoods and parishes===
There are four parishes of the Church of Sweden on the island (from west to east):

* The celebrated first paragraph of August Strindberg&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;The Red Room&quot; (&quot;Röda rummet&quot;) describes Stockholm as seen from Mosebacke on Södermalm, where much of the story takes place. 
* &quot;City of My Dreams&quot; (&quot;Mina drömmars stad&quot;), the first in a series of books by Per Anders Fogelström telling the story of several generations of Stockholmers, follows the young worker &quot;Henning&#x27;s&quot; life on Södermalm.
* Lisbeth Salander and other characters in the &quot;Millennium Trilogy&quot; by Stieg Larsson live and work on Södermalm. Much of the action in those books takes place in that district.
* Greta Garbo grew up in the area.
* The artists Yung Lean, Bladee, and Ecco2K grew up in the area, all of them eventually becoming future collaborators.

===In pop culture===

* Mojang, a video game developer and publisher best known for the creation of the popular game &quot;Minecraft&quot;, has their main offices located on Södermalm.

<doc id="796831" wikidata="Q7390505" url="?curid=796831" title="SITO (artist collective)">
<text>SITO is an online artist collective which began in January 1993, making it one of the oldest Internet-based art organizations. It was started by Ed Stastny and has been maintained by Stastny and a group of volunteers and supporters. 

From its beginning, SITO had a mission different from many established Internet art resources, in that rather than be an electronic journal of discussions or writings about art, it chose to be a repository for artwork in order to facilitate sharing and exposure. As this was the Internet pre-World Wide Web, SITO accomplished this by using anonymous FTP sites. Another important part of the SITO mission was to be open to all levels of artists, and at no cost. SITO was one of the earliest online galleries, and this showcase of artwork has become known as the &quot;Artchive&quot;.

Popular pronunciations of SITO are &quot;SEE-toe&quot; and &quot;SIT-oh&quot;. SITO was originally called &quot;OTIS&quot;, which was an acronym for &quot;Operative Term is Stimulate&quot;. The title &quot;SITO&quot; is merely a reversal of &quot;OTIS&quot; and is not officially an acronym, though some playful expansions have been suggested by users of the site. One such expansion is &quot;Still I Think OTIS&quot;, which has the distinction of containing a nested acronym.

==Collaborative projects==
Another focus of SITO that soon developed was an active interest in art games and experimentation with collaborative art projects using the Internet as a means of communicating. The first few such projects dabbled in dividing digital canvases amongst several artists (e.g. &quot;Grid&quot; and &quot;Crosswire&quot; projects) or translating traditional art games such as exquisite corpse to the digital medium. These projects were in full swing by 1994 and were grouped together under the heading &quot;Synergy&quot; on SITO.

In 1996, the SITO Synergy project &quot;HyGrid&quot; was honored with a Prix Ars Electronica award. &quot;HyGrid&quot; is a twisting, looping, multi-dimensional maze of small panels of art which is built up by hundreds of artists. It is still active today. Gridcosm started in 1997 and proved even more popular with over 22000 contributions to its recursing collaborative collage and continues to grow daily.

==OTIS vs. SITO==
SITO originally was announced as &quot;The OTIS Project&quot;, with a subtitle of &quot;The Operative Term is Stimulate&quot;, which is where the acronym OTIS came from. This mostly whimsical choice became the name of the project and, in mid-1995, became an unexpected problem. An art college in the United States named Otis was troubled by the fact that OTIS made use of the term &quot;OTIS Gallery&quot; and used the domain otis.org. They sent a cease-and-desist letter and various other threats. The collective discussed the situation and decided something so whimsical was hardly worth fussing over and elected to simply reverse the acronym, thus becoming SITO.

<text>Sandbanks is an affluent neighbourhood of Poole, Dorset, on the south coast of England, situated on a narrow spit of around 1 km2 or 0.39 sq mi extending into the mouth of Poole Harbour.

It is known for its high property prices and for its award-winning beach. In 2005, Sandbanks was reported to have the fourth highest land value by area in the world. The Sandbanks and Canford Cliffs Coastline area has been dubbed &quot;Britain&#x27;s Palm Beach&quot;.

==Geography==

Sandbanks is connected to Studland by the Sandbanks Ferry, a chain ferry across the mouth of the harbour. The Sandbanks area of Poole Harbour (known as North Haven Lake) is used for water sports and by light marina craft. The north side is home to the Southern Headquarters of the Royal Yachting Association and a sailing school.

Views to the north are across Poole Harbour and to Poole. To the south views extend across the English Channel and to the coastline of Studland and Swanage in the west.

==Property==
Sandbanks is a predominantly residential area, with homes stretching east from the Harbour to The Avenue, the eastern boundary of Poole. Homes often sell for millions of pounds.

==Facilities==
The Haven Hotel in Sandbanks, constructed in 1887, was where Guglielmo Marconi performed wireless experiments in the late 1890s while living there. Sandbanks was the third place in the world to have a permanent wireless station (1899).

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Sandbanks in 1865. The crew had to travel from Poole in a horse-drawn carriage whenever it was launched so a new Poole Lifeboat Station was opened at Fisherman&#x27;s Dock on Poole Quay in 1882.

== Politics ==
Sandbanks is part of the Canford Cliffs ward which elects two councillors to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, and also the Poole parliamentary constituency.

==Notable present or former residents==
*Geoffrey Boycott – Former test cricketer.
*Liam Gallagher - Singer.
*Karl Pilkington - Presenter, author and actor.
*Tony Pulis – Former manager of Stoke City.
*Harry Redknapp – Former football manager and player. Moved to Branksome Park in 2021.
*Celia Sawyer – Dealer on &quot;Four Rooms&quot; (Channel 4) and presenter of &quot;Your Home in Their Hands&quot; (BBC1).
*Mimi Smith – Maternal aunt and guardian of musician John Lennon.
*
==Transport==
Sandbanks is accessible by car on two B-roads: B3369 from Parkstone and B3065 from Westbourne, or via Sandbanks Ferry from Studland. Sandbanks, along with Bournemouth and Poole, has easy access to the M27 motorway at Southampton via the A338 and A31 roads.

The nearest railway station is at Parkstone, about 4 km away but there are no public transport routes connecting there. Instead, the Purbeck Breezer bus route runs daily from Bournemouth railway station, the major station in the conurbation; seasonal routes (some departures only) run from Poole bus station, near to Poole railway station.

<doc id="796841" wikidata="Q918936" url="?curid=796841" title="Sargeist">
<text>Sargeist is a Finnish black metal band formed in 1999. Originally created as a solo project by Shatraug of the Finnish black metal act Horna, he was joined by other members since 2000, who subsequently left the band. After the demo recording &quot;Tyranny Returns&quot; (2001), the line-up was augmented by Hoath Torog and Horns, both from the Finnish black metal outfit Behexen, and this line-up remained stable until 2016.

Both musically and lyrically, Sargeist stays close to the roots of Scandinavian &quot;old school&quot; black metal. Lyrical subjects thus often deal with Satanism and anti-Christian blasphemy, as well as darkness, depression, misanthropy and hate. The band&#x27;s name combines the two German words, &quot;sarg&quot; (coffin) and &quot;geist&quot; (spirit, ghost), and derives from the song &quot;The Old Coffin Spirit&quot; by the black metal band Rotting Christ. All members go by pseudonyms.

<text>Lonsdale Quay Market is a major public market and tourist destination located in the city of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The market is located at the foot of Lonsdale Avenue and is adjacent to the Lonsdale Quay SeaBus terminal and transit exchange that serves Metro Vancouver&#x27;s North Shore municipalities. The headquarters for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia is located in a neighbouring building.

==History==
The marketplace opened just prior to Expo 86 on April 12, 1986, and features over 80 tenants, including food retailers, restaurants, retail shops, artisans and a boutique hotel. The quay was built on the former site of North Van Ship Repair, a major shipyard during World War II. In the 2010s, the quay area became the site of intensive construction of housing developments, backed by Mayor Darrell Mussatto.

<text>Wallace&#x27;s hanging parrot (Loriculus flosculus) also known as the Flores hanging parrot, is a small (length: 11–12 cm) parrot endemic to the island of Flores.
This is an arboreal parrot. The male is predominantly green, with a red bill, a red spot on the throat, orange legs and dark red nape, bright red rump and uppertail-coverts. The female has the red on the throat reduced or absent.

This parrot qualifies as Endangered as it has a very small range and population. The main threat is habitat destruction. The current population is estimated at between 2,500 and 10,000.

It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, and biologist.

<text>The Sangihe hanging parrot (Loriculus catamene) is a small (length: 12–13.5 cm) parrot endemic to the small island of Sangihe, north of Sulawesi, Indonesia.

This is an arboreal parrot. It is predominantly green, with a red throat patch, rump, elongated uppertail-coverts and tip of tail.

In 2009 this parrot was downlisted from Endangered to Near Threatened because although it has a very small range within which there has been extensive forest loss and fragmentation, it apparently remains common in degraded and cultivated habitats and there is no evidence of a continuing decline. The current population is estimated at between 10,000 and 46,000 individuals.

<doc id="796855" wikidata="Q906511" url="?curid=796855" title="English ship Revenge (1577)">
<text>Revenge was an English race-built galleon of 46 guns, built in 1577 and captured by the Spanish in 1591, sinking soon afterwards. She was the first of 13 English and Royal Navy ships to bear the name.

==Construction==
&quot;Revenge&quot; was built at a cost of £4,000 at the Royal Dockyard, Deptford in 1577 by master shipwright Mathew Baker. His race-built design was to usher in a new style of ship building that would revolutionise naval warfare for the next three hundred years. A comparatively small vessel, weighing about 400 tons, being about half the size of &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot; was rated as a galleon.

==Armament==
The armament of ships of this period was fluid; guns might be added, removed or changed for different types. &quot;Revenge&quot; was particularly heavily armed during her last cruise: she carried 20 heavy demi-cannon, culverins and demi-culverins on her gun deck, where the sailors slept. On her upper decks were more demi-culverins, sakers and a variety of light weapons, including swivel-mounted breech-loaders, called &quot;fowlers&quot; or &quot;falconets&quot;.

==Career==
===Raid on Cadiz (1587)===

In 1587, Sir Francis Drake sailed to the Spanish coast and destroyed much &quot;materiel&quot; that Philip II had accumulated in preparation for the Armada. In consequence, Spanish plans for the invasion of England were put off until the following year.

===Battle of Gravelines (1588)===
In early 1588, Drake moved his flag from &quot;Elizabeth Bonaventure&quot; to &quot;Revenge&quot;, which was considered to be the best by far of the new ships. On 8 August 1588 the Battle of Gravelines (named after a Flemish town near Calais), was concluded with a decisive victory over the Spanish fleet. Following &quot;Revenge&quot; at the head of the line, the English fleet engaged their broadsides into the Spanish Armada, following a fire ships attack the night before which broke up the tight Spanish formation. Many Spanish vessels were severely damaged, although only a few sank or ran aground. Both sides fought until supplies of ammunition was running dangerously low, and the shattered Armada was forced to flee into the North Sea. The English fleet shadowed them until they drew level with Edinburgh, and then returned to port, ending the threat of a Spanish invasion.

===Drake–Norris expedition (1589)===

In 1589 &quot;Revenge&quot; again put to sea as Drake&#x27;s flagship, in what was to be a failed attempt to destroy the surviving Spanish fleet at Santander and invade Spanish-controlled Portugal. Returning with the ship in an unseaworthy condition, and without any prizes to his credit Drake fell out of favour with Queen Elizabeth I and was kept ashore until 1595.

===Frobisher expedition (1590)===
In 1590 &quot;Revenge&quot; was commanded by Sir Martin Frobisher in an unsuccessful expedition along the coast of Spain to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet.

==Capture by the Spanish and sinking (1591)==
In order to impede a Spanish naval recovery after the Armada, Sir John Hawkins proposed a blockade of the supply of treasure being acquired from the Spanish Empire in America by a constant naval patrol designed to intercept Spanish ships. &quot;Revenge&quot; was on such a patrol in the summer of 1591 under the command of Sir Richard Grenville.

The Spanish had dispatched a fleet of some 53 ships under Alonso de Bazán, having under his orders generals Martín de Bertendona and Marcos de Aramburu. Intent upon the capture of the English at Flores in the northern Azores. In late August 1591 the Spanish fleet came upon the English while repairs to the ships caused the crews, many of whom were suffering an epidemic of fever, to be ashore. Most of the ships managed to slip away to sea. Grenville who had many sick men ashore decided to wait for them. When putting to sea he might have gone round the west of Corvo island, but he decided to go straight through the Spaniards, who were approaching from the eastward.

The battle began late on 31 August, when overwhelming force was immediately brought to bear upon the ship, which put up a fierce resistance. For some time he succeeded by skillful tactics in avoiding much of the enemy&#x27;s fire, but they were all round him and gradually numbers began to tell. As one Spanish ship retired beaten, another took her place, and for fifteen hours the unequal contest continued. Attempts by the Spaniards to board were driven off. &quot;San Felipe&quot;, a vessel three times her size, tried to come alongside for the Spaniards to board her, along with Aramburu&#x27;s &quot;San Cristóbal&quot;. After boarding &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;San Felipe&quot; was forced to break off. Seven men of the boarding party died, and the other three were rescued by &quot;San Bernabé&quot;, which grappled her shortly after. The Spanish also lost the galleon &quot;Ascensión&quot; and a smaller vessel by accident that night, after they collided with each other. Meanwhile, &quot;San Cristóbal&quot;, which had come to help &quot;San Felipe&quot;, rammed &quot;Revenge&quot; underneath her aftcastle, and some time later, Bertendona&#x27;s &quot;San Bernabé&quot; battered the English warship with heavy fire, inflicting many casualties and severe damage. The English crew returned fire from the embrasures below deck. When morning broke on 1 September, &quot;Revenge&quot; lay with her masts shot away, six feet of water on the hold and only sixteen men left uninjured out of a crew of two hundred and fifty. She remained grappled by the galleons &quot;San Bernabé&quot; and &quot;San Cristóbal&quot;, the latter with her bow shattered by the ramming. The grappling manoeuvre of &quot;San Bernabé&quot;, which compelled the English gun crews to abandon their posts in order to fight off boarding parties, was decisive in securing the fate of the &quot;Revenge&quot;.

&quot;Out-gunned, out-fought, and out-numbered fifty-three to one&quot;, when the end looked certain Grenville ordered &quot;Revenge&quot; to be sunk: &quot;Sink me the ship, Master Gunner—sink her, split her in twain! Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!&quot; His officers could not agree with this order and a surrender was agreed by which the lives of the officers and crew would be spared. After an assurance of proper conduct, and having held off dozens of Spanish ships, &quot;Revenge&quot; at last surrendered. The injured Grenville died of wounds two days later aboard the Spanish flagship.

The captured but heavily damaged &quot;Revenge&quot; never reached Spain, but was lost with her mixed prize-crew of 70 Spaniards and English captives, along with a large number of the Spanish ships in a dreadful storm off the Azores. The battle-damaged &quot;Revenge&quot; was cast upon a cliff next to the island off Terceira, where she broke up completely. Between 1592 and 1593, 14 guns of the &quot;Revenge&quot; were recovered by the Spanish from the site of the wreck. Other cannons were driven ashore years later by the tide, and the last weapons raised were salvaged as late as 1625.

==&quot;Revenge&quot; in literature and the arts==
Her final action inspired a popular poem entitled &quot;&quot; by Lord Tennyson, which dramatically narrates the course of the engagement. Charles Villiers Stanford composed a choral setting of the poem in 1886, which proved popular at the time.

Al Stewart&#x27;s song &quot;Lord Grenville&quot; (on his 1976 album &quot;Year of the Cat&quot;) concerns the end of the &quot;Revenge&quot; at Flores.

Sir Richard Grenville and the Revenge are the subject matter of the Strawhead song Grenville and the Revenge in their Gentlemen of Fortune album.

<text>St. Peter Port () is a town and one of the ten parishes on the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is the capital of the Bailiwick of Guernsey as well as the main port. The population in 2019 was 18,958.

St. Peter Port is a small town (commonly referred to by locals as just &quot;town&quot;) consisting mostly of steep, narrow streets and steps on the overlooking slopes. It is known that a trading post/town existed here before Roman times with a pre-Christian name which has not survived.

The parish covers an area of 6.5 km2. The postal code for addresses in the parish starts with GY1.

People from St. Peter Port were nicknamed &quot;les Villais&quot; (the townspeople) or &quot;cllichards&quot; in Guernésiais.

==Geography==
St. Peter Port is on the east coast of Guernsey overlooking Herm and the tiny Jethou; a further channel separates Sark and surrounding islets such as Brecqhou; Normandy&#x27;s long Cotentin Peninsula and, to the south-east, Jersey are visible in very clear conditions from some of the town&#x27;s highest vantage points. The parish borders St. Sampson in the north, The Vale in the north-west, St. Andrew in the west and St. Martin in the south.

The name of the nearest channel is the Little Russel, in which sits the Bréhon Tower; that separating Sark is the Big Russel. Both in width are less than half of Guernsey&#x27;s greatest length and dotted with coastal rocks and stacks quite near those islands, some of which are narrowly submerged.

;Relief
The land in the north and by the harbour is low-lying but not marshy. In the south, the land gets higher (but not as high as St Martin&#x27;s or the Forest). Grassy, gently terraced cliffs behind sea walls (including projections) topped by trees characterise the southern part of the coast here (by an underground military museum and historic battery at semi-wooded Havelet). In the north is the more built-up Admiral Park development. To the south of the town lies Havelet Bay and the coastal path which leads to the very pretty Fermain Bay after a walk of about 20–25 minutes.

==Climate==
St. Peter Port has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild summers and cool winters.

==Subdivisions==

Saint Peter Port is subdivided into four cantons:
#Canton 1 or North Canton
#Canton 2 or Canton of the North-West
#Canton 3 or Canton of the South-West
#Canton 4 or Canton of the South

In addition, the islands of Herm and Jethou belong to the parish, but are not part of any canton. They belong to Electoral district Saint Peter Port South.

==Sport and leisure==

St. Peter Port has an English Isthmian League club, Guernsey F.C. who play at Footes Lane. The Guernsey Rugby Football Club also play at Footes Lane and compete in National League 3 London &amp; SE.

St. Peter Port is covered by the local television news programmes: BBC Channel Islands News and ITV News Channel TV. Guernsey&#x27;s two main radio stations: BBC Radio Guernsey and Island FM are based in the town. The local newspaper is the &quot;Guernsey Press&quot;.

<text>Bosna is a spicy Austrian fast food dish, said to have originated in Salzburg. It is believed to have been invented in 1949 by a man named Zanko Todoroff. It is now popular all over western Austria and southern Bavaria.

It resembles a hot dog, consisting mainly of a Bratwurst sausage, onions and a blend of mustard and/or tomato ketchup and curry powder (Curry ketchup). Bosna is made with white bread and is usually grilled briefly before serving.

== Variations ==
Several variations of the dish exist:
* &quot;Kleine Bosna&quot; (small bosna), with only one sausage
* &quot;Große Bosna&quot; (large bosna), with two sausages
* &quot;Kafka&quot; (named after Franz Kafka, &quot;Käsekrainer Bosna&quot;), with a different sausage type; generally a sausage with a different meat, more spice and cheese

<text>Arthur Schwartz (November 25, 1900 – September 3, 1984) was an American composer and film producer, widely noted for his songwriting collaborations with Howard Dietz.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Schwartz was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City, on November 25, 1900. He taught himself to play the harmonica and piano as a child, and began playing for silent films at age 14. He earned a B.A. in English at New York University and an M.A. in Architecture at Columbia. Forced by his father, an attorney, to study law, Schwartz graduated from NYU Law School with a Juris Doctor and was admitted to the bar in 1924.

===Career===
While studying law, he supported himself by teaching English in the New York school system. He also worked on songwriting concurrently with his studies and published his first song (&quot;Baltimore, Md., You&#x27;re the Only Doctor for Me&quot;, with lyrics by Eli Dawson) by 1923. Acquaintances such as Lorenz Hart and George Gershwin encouraged him to stick with composing. He attempted to convince Howard Dietz, an MGM publicist who had collaborated with Jerome Kern, to work with him, but Dietz initially declined.

As Artist Direct documents: Schwartz placed his first songs in a Broadway show, &quot;The New Yorkers&quot; (March 10, 1927). By 1928, he had closed his law office and convinced Dietz to write with him. Their first songs together were used in the Broadway revue &quot;The Little Show&quot; (April 30, 1929) and included &quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Have to Change My Plan&quot;, which belatedly became a hit three years later when it was recorded by Rudy Vallée. Schwartz&#x27;s career was launched, and in 1930 he contributed songs to six shows, three in London and three in New York, the most successful of which was &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (October 15, 1930), which featured the same cast as &quot;The Little Show&quot; and featured the hit &quot;Something to Remember You By&quot;. Schwartz also started contributing songs to motion pictures, beginning with &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of You&quot; (lyrics by Ralph Rainger and Edward Eliscu) in &quot;Queen High&quot; (1930).

Among other Broadway musicals for which Schwartz wrote the music are: &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1931), &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1951), &quot;By the Beautiful Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;The Gay Life&quot; (1961), and &quot;Jennie&quot; (1963). His films include the MGM musical &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953) with lyrics by Dietz.

Schwartz also worked as a producer, for Columbia Pictures. His work includes the musical &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944) and the Cole Porter biographical film &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946).

===Family===
Schwartz was married to 1930s Broadway ingénue Kay Carrington, until her death when their first son, Jonathan Schwartz (born 1938), was 14. Jonathan is now a radio personality and sometime musician. Schwartz&#x27;s younger son, Paul Schwartz (born 1956), with actress/dancer Mary Schwartz, is a composer, conductor, pianist, and producer.

===Death===
Arthur Schwartz died September 3, 1984, in Kintnersville, Pennsylvania.

==Awards==
Schwartz received two Academy Award nominations for Best Song: the first in 1944 for &quot;They&#x27;re Either Too Young or Too Old&quot; in the film &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;; the second in 1948 for &quot;A Gal in Calico&quot; from the film &quot;The Time, the Place and the Girl&quot;.

In 1972, Schwartz was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1981, he was inducted in 1981 into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

In 1990, Schwartz&#x27;s hit, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; from the film &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, was awarded the ASCAP Award for Most Performed Feature Film Standard.

==Collaborators==
Schwartz collaborated with some of the best lyricists of his day, including Dietz, Dorothy Fields, Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein II, Edward Heyman, Frank Loesser, Johnny Mercer, Leo Robin, and Al Stillman.

<doc id="796885" wikidata="Q7011036" url="?curid=796885" title="New Politics Network">
<text>The New Politics Network (NPN) was an independent political and campaigning think tank in the United Kingdom, concerned with democratic renewal and popular participation in politics. It was founded as the successor to Democratic Left in 1999, and merged with Charter 88 to form Unlock Democracy in 2007.

==Origin==
The NPN was established in December 1999 following the winding up of Democratic Left, the legal successor organisation to the former Communist Party of Great Britain. Its first director was Nina Temple. Democratic Left had briefly become the New Times Network, publishing a magazine, &quot;New Times&quot;, until the summer of 1999, before it became the NPN.

==Activities==
The NPN had around 200 to 250 members. The NPN worked with a wide range of groups and individuals to provide a forum to look at emerging ideas in society. Its stated goal was to provide an independent and innovative debate on the future of politics. With the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust it funded the tactical voting website Tacticalvoter.net during the 2001 general election, although it was not involved with the 2005 campaign of the same name.

While it was predicted by Nick Cohen in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 2000 that NPN would merge with Make Votes Count and Charter 88, Nina Temple among others attempted to steer the organisation back towards its democratic socialist roots at the 2003 AGM. If this had been successful, the organisation may well have ended up as part of the Compass pressure group.

The NPN owned an office block in Islington, north London, a property company called Rodell, and an office in the Midlands.

==Merger==
In November 2007 the NPN, by then directed by Peter Facey, merged with Charter 88 to form a new campaigning group, Unlock Democracy. The contribution of NPN to this merger was substantially financial, due to the dire situation in which Charter 88 had found itself. The NPN strapline &quot;connecting people and politics&quot; was however, retained.

<doc id="796890" wikidata="Q6790747" url="?curid=796890" title="Matthew Johns">
<text>Matthew James Johns (born 27 July 1971) is an Australian rugby league media personality, commentator and former professional player. An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative , Johns played his club football primarily with the Newcastle Knights, alongside his younger brother, Andrew. Since March 2011, Johns has been a co-host on the Triple M Sydney breakfast show called The Grill Team with Mark Geyer. Since 2012, Johns has been a part of the Fox Sports NRL coverage. He had his own show on Channel 7 for one season in 2010, &quot;The Matty Johns Show&quot; and since 2013 has hosted a rugby league analysis and light entertainment show on Foxtel airing two nights each week.

==Playing career==

He played as for the Knights, playing outside his younger brother Andrew Johns at halfback for nine seasons. Johns was part of the Australian squad that won the 1995 Rugby League World Cup, and went on to play eight matches for his country. He also played four State of Origin series matches for New South Wales for four losses. Another highlight of his career with the Knights was the 1997 Australian Rugby League grand final victory over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.

Johns was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at five-eighth and scored a try in the Kangaroos&#x27; 22–20 victory.

Salary cap problems led to Johns leaving the Newcastle club at the end of 2000 to play a season with the UK based Super League club Wigan. He considered playing for Wales at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup due to his Welsh heritage. Johns played for the Wigan Warriors at five-eighth in their 2001 Super League Grand Final loss to the Bradford Bulls.

Johns returned to the National Rugby League in 2002 to play a season with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, before shoulder and neck injuries forced his retirement at the end of the season.

===2002 NZ tour sexual assault investigation===
While on a pre-season tour of New Zealand in February 2002, Johns and 11 other unnamed members of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks were involved in a group sex session with a 19-year-old in Johns&#x27; Christchurch hotel room. Following an allegation of sexual assault from the woman five days later, police investigated the incident both in New Zealand and Australia but did not lay any charges.

Seven years later the ABC TV &quot;Four Corners&quot; documentary program &quot;Code of Silence&quot;, broadcast on 11 May 2009, reported on the incident. Although &quot;Four Corners&quot; spoke to Johns about the incident, he declined to give an on-camera interview for the program. The alleged victim (known by the pseudonym &quot;Clare&quot;) stated that she had returned to room 21 of the Racecourse Hotel with Johns and another player, and that when one of them began to kiss her without her consent, she felt socially awkward objecting to the unwanted advance; which eventually led to sex.

Johns admitted to taking part but stated that the act was consensual. In May 2009, Johns agreed to be interviewed by the Nine Network to give his viewpoint of the incident, saying it had been painful for his family and regretted what happened. He stated that he had been apprehensive about the consequences of the incident for seven years.

Subsequent to the &quot;Four Corners&quot; program, Johns was stood down by Channel Nine from his role as rugby league commentator and co-host of &quot;The Footy Show&quot;. The Melbourne Storm also took the step of releasing Johns indefinitely as an assistant coach.

==Entertainment career==
===Film===

Johns&#x27;s first foray into entertainment began in 1999 when he adopted the persona of Reg Reagan in a low-budget film, &quot;In Search of the Holy Grail&quot;, which was made for The Shoot Out 24 Hour Filmmaking Festival in Newcastle. The film also starred fellow Knights players Andrew Johns as Bruno, Matthew Gidley, Trent Watson, Danny Buderus and Robbie O&#x27;Davis. The Nine Network showed excerpts of the film on &quot;The Footy Show&quot;.

The Reg Reagan character was developed further in an article in &quot;the Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in 2000 where Johns described the character as a late 1970s Australian (or ocker) who smoked only Winfield Reds and drank KB beer. Fans of Johns&#x27;s new side Cronulla started wearing copies of the T-shirt worn by Reagan, with the slogan &quot;Bring Back the Biff&quot;, to games.

Johns appeared in &quot;Footy Legends&quot; where he appeared as himself. The film was directed by Khoa Do, and released on 3 August 2006. In 2007 The Final Winter presented Johns in his first feature film acting role where he starred as &#x27;Jack&#x27;, the 1980s coach of the Newtown Jets.

===Television===
In 2002, Johns became a regular on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; with Reagan and a new character, Trent, a gay flight attendant from San Francisco. After his retirement as a player, Johns signed deals with the Nine Network and Sony Music Entertainment. He appeared on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; and as a commentator on Nine&#x27;s broadcasts of rugby league matches. He has recorded a DVD titled &quot;All of Me&quot;, released in June 2004, featuring skits by Reg Reagan and Trent the flight attendant.

In 2004, as Reg Reagan, Johns recorded a song called &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See the Biff Again?&quot; sung to the tune of The Angels&#x27; 1976 hit &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again?&quot;. The song is a humorous lamentation of the decline of onfield violence in professional rugby league.

Johns was indefinitely stood down from his position on the Nine Network in May 2009 after the airing of the Four Corners program. He was subsequently replaced by Phil Gould. He was asked by Channel 9 to make a comeback to commentary later in the season but Johns declined.

Towards the end of 2009, Johns turned down a $600,000-a-year contract with Channel 9 in favour of starting up his own production company alongside John Singleton.

In 2010, Johns signed with rival network Channel Seven and launched a new family-friendly, NRL/entertainment show on 25 March at 7:30pm in NSW and Queensland. After one season, the show was discontinued.

In 2012, Johns joined Fox Sports (Australia) as part of their rugby league coverage. He is the host of his own show &quot;Sunday Night with Matty Johns&quot;.

===Author===
In 2004, Johns released Reg Reagan&#x27;s &#x27;This Is My Life&#x27; through Pan Macmillan.

===Radio===
In March 2011 Johns joined Triple M Sydney&#x27;s breakfast show &quot;The Grill Team&quot; introducing a number of character impersonations including &quot;Bruce&quot;, the effeminate producer for Triple M&#x27;s sister station 2DayFM&#x27;s breakfast team Kyle and Jackie O; the crude coal-mining magnate (and owner of the Newcastle Knights) Nathan Tinkler; and the rugby league greats Andrew Johns, Brad Fittler and Darren Lockyer as the &quot;Future Immortals Gone Nuts&quot;. His last day in the Grill Team was on 7 December 2018. Johns currently work on SEN radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Glory with Matty Johns&quot; program. In June 2023, his brother Andrew Johns quit the show after a public falling out over comments Matthew Johns made about Queensland ahead of the 2023 State of Origin series.

==Personal life==
Johns is founder and co-owner of Steel City Beer Company with Andrew Johns, Danny Buderus, Kurt Gidley and Matt Hoy.

Johns&#x27; sons, Cooper Johns and Jack Johns, are former rugby league players.

<doc id="796893" wikidata="Q1566372" url="?curid=796893" title="Haag's theorem">
<text>While working on the mathematical physics of an interacting, relativistic, quantum field theory, Rudolf Haag developed an argument against the existence of the interaction picture, a result now commonly known as Haag’s theorem. Haag’s original proof relied on the specific form of then-common field theories, but subsequently generalized by a number of authors, notably Dick Hall and Arthur Wightman, who concluded that no single, universal Hilbert space representation can describe both free and interacting fields. A generalization due to Michael C. Reed and Barry Simon shows that applies to free neutral scalar fields of different masses, which implies that the interaction picture is always inconsistent, even in the case of a free field.

== Introduction ==

Traditionally, describing a quantum field theory requires describing a set of operators satisfying the canonical (anti)commutation relations, and a Hilbert space on which those operators act. Equivalently, one should give a representation of the free algebra on those operators, modulo the canonical commutation relations (the CCR/CAR algebra); in the latter perspective, the underlying algebra of operators is the same, but different field theories correspond to different (i.e., unitarily inequivalent) representations.

Philosophically, the action of the CCR algebra should be irreducible, for otherwise the theory can be written as the combined effects of two separate fields. That principle implies the existence of a cyclic vacuum state. Importantly, a vacuum uniquely determines the algebra representation, because it is cyclic.

Two different specifications of the vacuum are common: the minimum-energy eigenvector of the field Hamiltonian, or the state annihilated by the number operator . When these specifications describe different vectors, the vacuum is said to polarize, after the physical interpretation in the case of quantum electrodynamics.

Haag&#x27;s result explains that the same quantum field theory must treat the vacuum very differently when interacting vs. free.

== Formal description ==
In its modern form, the Haag theorem has two parts:

# If a quantum field is free and Euclidean-invariant in the spatial dimensions, then that field&#x27;s vacuum does not polarize.
# If two Poincaré-invariant quantum fields share the same vacuum, then their first four Wightman functions coincide. Moreover, if one such field is free, then the other must also be a free field of the same mass.

This state of affairs is in stark contrast to ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics, where there is always a unitary equivalence between the free and interacting representations. That fact is used in constructing the interaction picture, where operators are evolved using a free field representation, while states evolve using the interacting field representation. Within the formalism of quantum field theory (QFT) such a picture generally does not exist, because these two representations are unitarily inequivalent. Thus the quantum field theorist is confronted with the so-called &quot;choice problem&quot;: One must choose the ‘right’ representation among an uncountably-infinite set of representations which are not equivalent.

== Physical / heuristic point of view ==
As was already noticed by Haag in his original work, vacuum polarization lies at the core of Haag’s theorem. Any interacting quantum field (or non-interacting fields of different masses) polarizes the vacuum, and as a consequence the vacuum state lies inside a renormalized Hilbert space formula_1 that differs from the Hilbert space formula_2 of the free field. Although an isomorphism could always be found that maps one Hilbert space into the other, Haag’s theorem implies that no such mapping could deliver unitarily equivalent representations of the corresponding canonical commutation relations, i.e. unambiguous physical results.

== Work-arounds ==
Among the assumptions that lead to Haag’s theorem is translation invariance of the system. Consequently, systems that can be set up inside a box with periodic boundary conditions or that interact with suitable external potentials escape the conclusions of the theorem.

Haag (1958) and David Ruelle (1962) have presented the Haag–Ruelle scattering theory, which deals with asymptotic free states and thereby serves to formalize some of the assumptions needed for the LSZ reduction formula. These techniques, however, cannot be applied to massless particles and have unsolved issues with bound states.

== Quantum field theorists’ conflicting reactions ==
While some physicists and philosophers of physics have repeatedly emphasized how seriously Haag’s theorem undermines the foundations of QFT, the majority of practicing quantum field theorists simply dismiss the issue. Most quantum field theory texts geared to practical appreciation of the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions do not even mention it, implicitly assuming that some rigorous set of definitions and procedures may be found to firm up the powerful and well-confirmed heuristic results they report on.

For example, asymptotic structure (cf. QCD jets) is a specific calculation in strong agreement with experiment, but nevertheless should fail by dint of Haag’s theorem. The general feeling is that this is not some calculation that was merely stumbled upon, but rather that it embodies a physical truth. The practical calculations and tools are motivated and justified by an appeal to a grand mathematical formalism called QFT. Haag’s theorem suggests that the formalism is not well-founded, yet the practical calculations are sufficiently distant from the abstract formalism that any weaknesses there do not affect (or invalidate) practical results.

As was pointed out by Teller (1997):Everyone must agree that as a piece of mathematics Haag’s theorem is a valid result that at least appears to call into question the mathematical foundation of interacting quantum field theory, and agree that at the same time the theory has proved astonishingly successful in application to experimental results. Tracy Lupher (2005) suggested that the wide range of conflicting reactions to Haag’s theorem may partly be caused by the fact that the same exists in different formulations, which in turn were proved within different formulations of QFT such as Wightman’s axiomatic approach or the LSZ formula. According to Lupher,The few who mention it tend to regard it as something important that someone (else) should investigate thoroughly.

Lawrence Sklar (2000) further pointed out:There may be a presence within a theory of conceptual problems that appear to be the result of mathematical artifacts. These seem to the theoretician to be not fundamental problems rooted in some deep physical mistake in the theory, but, rather, the consequence of some misfortune in the way in which the theory has been expressed. Haag’s theorem is, perhaps, a difficulty of this kind.

David Wallace (2011) has compared the merits of conventional QFT with those of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) and observed that... algebraic quantum field theory has unitarily inequivalent representations even on spatially finite regions, but this lack of unitary equivalence only manifests itself with respect to expectation values on arbitrary small spacetime regions, and these are exactly those expectation values which don’t convey real information about the world. He justifies the latter claim with the insights gained from modern renormalization group theory, namely the fact that... we can absorb all our ignorance of how the cutoff [i.e., the short-range cutoff required to carry out the renormalization procedure] is implemented, into the values of finitely many coefficients which can be measured empirically.

Concerning the consequences of Haag’s theorem, Wallace’s observation implies that since QFT does not attempt to predict fundamental parameters, such as particle masses or coupling constants, potentially harmful effects arising from unitarily non-equivalent representations remain absorbed inside the empirical values that stem from measurements of these parameters (at a given length scale) and that are readily imported into QFT. Thus they remain invisible to quantum field theorists, in practice.

<text>Mass Romantic is the debut studio album by Canadian indie rock supergroup the New Pornographers. Produced by David Carswell and band bassist John Collins, it was released on Mint Records on November 28, 2000. The album was three years in the making, with musicians A.C. Newman and Dan Bejar writing songs as early as 1998. With encouragement from peers, they recorded an album with other Canadian musicians from groups including the Evaporators, Zumpano, and Destroyer.

The album failed to chart in Canada or the United States, but the group had a sold-out tour, due to very positive reviews. It received a score of 87 from Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics.

== Production ==
&quot;Mass Romantic&quot; was recorded over the course of almost three years. The first four songs were finished in early 1998. The New Pornographers claimed that the songs &quot;were just sitting around. Friends would hear the songs and go, &#x27;This is really great,&#x27; and so it was kind of frustrating in a way. We&#x27;d go, &#x27;Yeah, well, we&#x27;re going to try to record a record.&#x27;&quot; The group&#x27;s producer and bassist John Collins decided to refer to themselves as a super group. The band consisted of Zumpano&#x27;s Carl Newman, John Collins of The Evaporators, Dan Bejar of Destroyer, Limblifter&#x27;s Kurt Dahle, filmmaker Blaine Thurier, and alternative country singer Neko Case.

Production on the album was difficult. A.C. Newman stated, &quot;I remember &#x27;Letter From an Occupant&#x27; was a pretty belabored song. It ended up being almost minimal, but I remember there&#x27;s so much shit we put on it. There&#x27;s a psychedelic 12-string guitar solo, a backwards guitar, there&#x27;s a kind of really cool synth that&#x27;s in there but buried. At some point, you have to choose. That was the hardest part about mixing the thing: just making that judgment call. I only feel at peace with the record now because people seem to like it.&quot;

The songs on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer frontman Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought &quot;&#x27;How could we lose?&#x27; You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking myself out of the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, &#x27;This band&#x27;s got to be great.&#x27; I thought, &#x27;Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.&#x27; But I have the most confidence in Dan&#x27;s songs because I&#x27;m totally outside of him, looking in. I&#x27;m just a fan of him.&quot;

The song &quot;Breakin&#x27; the Law&quot; was taken from Destroyer&#x27;s first album &quot;We&#x27;ll Build Them a Golden Bridge&quot;. The group vocals at the end of &quot;Breakin&#x27; the Law&quot; are credited to the Camp Northstar Kids&#x27; Chorus, a reference to the Canadian comedy film &quot;Meatballs&quot;. The chorus is actually every member of the band singing. Newman stated, &quot;I like the fact that people think that it&#x27;s a kids&#x27; group ... We made ourselves sound like a giant group, but we ended up sounding like little kids. I love the fact that in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review they mention the chorus of kids. I just think it&#x27;s great that people actually believe that, because it&#x27;s such a fucking ridiculous thing for a band to do.&quot;

== Style ==
Tim DiGravina of AllMusic called &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; an album that &quot;displays a decidedly power pop form of indie rock.&quot; DiGravina noted comparison per individual song with &quot;the Beatles (&#x27;The Mary Martin Show&#x27;) to David Bowie (&#x27;The Slow Descent into Alcoholism&#x27;) to T.Rex (&#x27;Mystery Hours&#x27;) to Todd Rundgren (&#x27;The Fake Headlines&#x27;).&quot; Jim Caliguiry of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; noted, &quot;They borrow from Cheap Trick, the Beach Boys, Big Star, Roxy Music, Buzzcocks, and Robyn Hitchcock&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also made comparisons to Big Star and Cheap Trick.

The album&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;ridiculous and melodramatic as they are witty&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Mass Romantic&quot; was released on November 21, 2000, by Mint Records on vinyl and compact disc in Canada. It received an official United States release when it was released in a remastered form by Matador Records on October 7, 2003. &quot;Letter from an Occupant&quot;, released on April 15, 2002, was the only single.

The New Pornographers went on their first tour to promote the album. The tour presented problems, including throat damage, broken-down buses, and having to take expensive cab rides. A.C. Newman spoke positively about the tour, stating, &quot;There&#x27;s been fairly good crowds, but the shows haven&#x27;t been that crazy. They&#x27;ve been getting better ... We&#x27;re not really a party band. I hope people can party. We give them the music! Isn&#x27;t that enough?&quot; The tour sold out.

== Reception ==
&quot;Mass Romantic&quot; was well received in the band&#x27;s native Canada, where it won a Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a score of 87, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Tim DiGravina of AllMusic described &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; as an album &quot;that reveals its charms through repeat listens, and makes a listener wonder how the band can master so many different musical styles via so many vocalists while still maintaining a fiercely cohesive sound.&quot; Laura Morgan of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;an insanely contagious concoction of new wave, Cheap Trick, and garage-glam pandemonium&quot; and &quot;a perfect pop album.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″s James Mann also spoke positively of the album, stating that the New Pornographers &quot;have made such a great album, tuneful, overdosed with hooks, that all the past sins of our Northern neighbors are forgiven. Well, maybe not Rush, but close.&quot;

Douglas Wolk of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; as &quot;a striking power-pop album, forty staggeringly catchy minutes of four-part harmonies and Wall of Sound production, exploding with energy and joy&quot;, while the &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called the album a &quot;masterful reproduction of underground power pop ca. 1979, complete with cheesy synths and slashing guitar leads&quot;. Tim Caligiuri of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Mass Romantic&quot; is the type of album nobody makes anymore. It&#x27;s an intricate and brightly colored gem, filled with sing-along melodies and sounds that shouldn&#x27;t work together yet do.&quot; In a mixed assessment, &quot;Q&quot; referred to &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; as &quot;charmingly poppy&quot;, but nonetheless an &quot;erratic affair&quot;. Tyler Martin of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; felt that &quot;too many misdirected ideas weigh this album down&quot;.

The album charted in several best of the year lists from various critics. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated it the ninth best album of 2001, stating, &quot;Energetic, smooth, and masterfully executed, &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; is the catchiest thing to come out in ages.&quot; The site later placed &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; at number 91 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. &quot;Magnet&quot; magazine included the album in its &quot;20 Best Albums of 2001&quot; list. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 2001, the album placed at number seventeen. In December 2007, &quot;Blender&quot; listed &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; as the 24th best indie rock album of all time. It is the second-highest Canadian album on the list behind Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Funeral&quot;, which was selected as the 6th best.

<text>is a Buddhist temple that was once one of the powerful Seven Great Temples in the city of Nara, Japan. The temple is the national headquarters of the Hossō school.

== History ==

Kōfuku-ji has its origin as a temple that was established in 669 by Kagami-no-Ōkimi (), the wife of Fujiwara no Kamatari, wishing for her husband&#x27;s recovery from illness. Its original site was in Yamashina, Yamashiro Province (present-day Kyoto). In 672, the temple was moved to Fujiwara-kyō, the first planned Japanese capital to copy the orthogonal grid pattern of Chang&#x27;an. In 710, the temple was dismantled for the second time and moved to its present location, on the east side of the newly constructed capital, Heijō-kyō, today&#x27;s Nara.

Kōfuku-ji was the Fujiwara&#x27;s tutelary temple, and enjoyed prosperity for as long as the family did. The temple was not only an important center for the Buddhist religion, but also retained influence over the imperial government, and even by &quot;aggressive means&quot; in some cases. When many of the Nanto Shichi Daiji, such as Tōdai-ji, declined after the move of capital to Heian-kyō (Kyoto), Kōfuku-ji kept its significance because of its connection to the Fujiwara.

The temple was damaged and destroyed by civil wars and fires many times, and was rebuilt as many times as well, although finally some of the important buildings, such as one of the three golden halls, the Nandaimon, Chūmon and the corridor were never reconstructed and are missing today. The rebuilding of the Central Golden Hall was completed in 2018.

Second in seniority of the orders of regular clerics (the Theatines being first), the Barnabites were founded in Milan, by Anthony Mary Zaccaria, Barthélemy Ferrari, and Jacopo Antonio Morigia. The region was then suffering severely from the wars between Charles V and Francis I, and Zaccaria saw the need for radical reform of the Church in Lombardy, afflicted by problems typical for that era: dioceses without a bishop, clergy with inadequate theological training, a decrease in religious practice, and monasteries and convents in decline.

It was approved by Pope Clement VII in the brief &quot;Vota per quae vos&quot; on 18 February 1533. Later approvals gave it the status of a Religious Order, but it is still normally referred to as a congregation. Both the date and the vocation place it among the Orders associated with the Counter-Reformation. Zaccaria&#x27;s holiness moved many to reform their lives but it also moved many to oppose him. Twice his community had to undergo an official religious investigation, and twice it was exonerated.

The order was given the name of &quot;Regular Clerics of St. Paul&quot; (Clerici Regulares Sancti Pauli). In 1538 the grand old monastery of Saint Barnabas by the city wall of Milan was given to the congregation as their main seat, and thenceforth they were known by the popular name of &quot;Barnabites&quot;. After the death of Zaccaria in 1539, the congregation was favoured and protected by Archbishop Charles Borromeo of Milan and later by Francis de Sales because of their successful missionary work in Upper Italy. Charles Borromeo presided, in 1579, as Cardinal Protector, over the commission which wrote the Constitutions of the Order. The General Chapters of the Order were regularly held at Milan until the reign of Pope Alexander VII (1655–67), who ordered them to convene in Rome. Pope Innocent XI (1676–89), however, finally decreed that they should be held in Rome and Milan alternately.

These assemblies of the Provincial Superiors were held every three years for the election of a new Superior General, whose term of office was limited to that period, only one re-election being allowed to each incumbent of the office.

The Society started pastoral activity among the working classes and in monasteries. In the early 17th century, the Barnabites gradually entered the field of education – work which was to remain a mark of their apostolate. They entered France under Henry IV in 1608, and Austria under Ferdinand II in 1626.

The present Constitution is an updated version dated 1983, which takes into account the changes from the Second Vatican Council. There is a female branch of Religious Sisters, the Angelic Sisters of St. Paul, found by Anthony Mary Zaccaria, and an organization for lay people, the Laity of St. Paul, originally called the Married of St. Paul and sometimes referred to in North America as the Oblates of St. Paul.

As of July 24, 2012, the new Superior General is a Brazilian, the Very Rev. Francisco Chagas Santos da Silva.

== Character of the Order ==
As indicated by the official name of the order, the work of the Barnabites is inspired by St. Paul the Apostle. In an address in 2000, to the institute&#x27;s General Chapter, Pope John Paul II noted, &quot;[I]n pointing out the ideal of religious and apostolic life to his spiritual sons, St Anthony Mary Zaccaria emphasized charity.&quot;

The members of the Order make, in addition to the three standard religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, a fourth vow never to strive for any office or position of dignity, or to accept such otherwise than under a command of the Holy See.

The focus of the goals of the Barnabite Order, besides preaching in general, catechizing, hearing confessions, giving missions, ministrations in hospitals and prisons, and the education of youth, includes also a particular devotion to the thorough study and exposition of St. Paul&#x27;s Epistles. Their habit is the black soutane which formed the usual garb of Milanese secular priests in the time of Borromeo. He himself was not a member but is venerated by the Barnabites as a secondary patron saint of their Order.

The first missions undertaken by the Order were in Italy, France, the former Duchy of Savoy, Austria and Bohemia. In the 18th century, they started missions in China and Brazil. Today, they serve in 15 countries. Until 2021 they were active in Afghanistan, where they had run the Afghan Catholic Mission since 1933, interrupted only while the Taliban regime was in power.

== Prominent Barnabites ==
Vincenzo Sangermano was a Barnabite who was a missionary in Burma and wrote several books about the Burmese people.

Barnabites engaged in a wide range of teaching, scholarship, and technological practice during the early modern era. Many Barnabites became great scholars and scientists, including the astronomers Redento Baranzano and Paolo Frisi, the naturalist Ermenegildo Pini and the meteorologist Francesco Denza.

Several members of the Order became cardinals. The first was Giacomo Antonio Morigia, Archbishop of Florence (1683–1699), one of the founders of the Barnabites, who was raised to the cardinalate on 12 December 1695 by Pope Innocent XII, though his appointment was kept secret (&quot;in pectore reservatus&quot;) until 19 December 1698. Hyacinthe Sigismond Gerdil, a Consultor of the Roman Inquisition, and former preceptor (supervising teacher), from 1758, of the Prince of Piedmont, afterwards King Charles Emmanuel IV, and then, in 1768, of Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s sons, was named a cardinal in secret (&quot;in pectore&quot;) on 23 June 1777, and announced publicly on 15 December 1777. Luigi Bilio (1826–1884), a Consultor of the Congregation of the Inquisition and collaborator in the production of the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot; (1864), was appointed a cardinal on 25 June 1866 by Pope Pius IX, and named Secretary of the Congregation of the Inquisition by Pope Leo XIII in 1883. Others were: Francesco Fontana, appointed in 1816 by Pope Pius VII; Luigi Lambruschini, appointed in 1831 by Pope Gregory XVI; Antonio Cadolini, appointed in 1843 by Gregory XVI; and Giuseppe Maria Graniello, appointed in 1893 by Pope Leo XIII.

John Bellarini (1552–1630), who was the Visitor of the Order, and twice held the office of Assistant Superior General, was also a theologian who wrote a number of works including an influential commentary on the Council of Trent.

<doc id="796918" wikidata="Q753845" url="?curid=796918" title="Suomi KP/-31">
<text>The Suomi KP/-31 () is a Finnish submachine gun that was mainly used during World War II. It is a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model, which was revealed to the public in 1925. It entered service in Finland in 1931, and remained in use until the 1980s.

The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by many as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II. It also had a profound effect on the conflict beyond Finland as the Soviet authorities, who had been dismissive of submachine guns, were persuaded of their fatal efficiency by the Finnish forces in the Winter War of 1939–1940. Though a relatively early design, the Suomi was a formidable weapon: highly controllable and with accuracy similar to that of the mass-produced PPSh-41 but at the cost of a significantly higher mass to absorb recoil, with a lower rate of fire and an equally large magazine capacity. Its major disadvantages were its higher weight, high maintenance requirements and high production cost, which led to the later introduction of the KP/-44, a close copy of the Soviet PPS-43 but accepting the existing magazines and drums for the KP/-31.

The M-22 and KP/-26 were made by Konepistooli Oy, founded by Master Armorer Aimo Lahti, Captain V. Korpela, Lieutenant Y. Koskinen and Lieutenant L. Boyer-Spoof. The Suomi KP/-31 was designed by Koskinen and Lahti.

==History==
The Suomi KP/-31 went into serial production in 1931 by Tikkakoski Oy which was owned by German arms dealer Willi Daugs and most of these weapons were bought by the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish Defence Forces were equipped with about 4000 Suomi KP/-31 submachine guns when the Winter War started. During the course of the war, the design was altered in February 1942 with the addition of a muzzle brake, which increased the submachine gun&#x27;s overall length by 55 mm and weight by half a pound. The revised version was designated KP/-31 &quot;SJR&quot; (&quot;suujarru&quot;, or &quot;muzzle brake&quot;). Aimo Lahti was displeased with this revision, believing that it decreased muzzle velocity and reduced the weapon&#x27;s reliability, and even sought in vain to have the unknown designer of the brake court-martialed. Ultimately, roughly half of the KP/-31s in Finnish service were of the SJR version.

The KP/-31 was unusual in that it had a replaceable barrel secured with four lugs rather than threads. Soldiers were issued at least one spare barrel. In close combat the weapon would overheat in sustained automatic fire, requiring the barrel to be changed. This was effected using a mitten or piece of thick cloth to secure, rotate, and remove the barrel jacket. Then the user would use the point of a &quot;puukko&quot; knife or a cleaning rod to loosen and remove the hot barrel. It was easy to then slide in and lock a fresh new barrel, secure the jacket, and resume firing.

The Finnish military initially issued it with the 20-round staggered-column magazine and early 40-round &quot;sissilipas&quot; (&quot;ranger magazine&quot;) drum. The magazine&#x27;s capacity was found to be too small for sustained fire. Up to 5 additional rounds could be loaded into it, but it was found that this damaged or over-compressed the springs and caused it to fail. The drum was found to be hard to reload in action because the backplate had to be taken off and the bullets loaded inside tip-downwards. The drum also had an open &quot;shot count window&quot; in the bottom of the drum; the numbers 1 to 40 were stamped on the feed plate and lined up with the window to indicate the shots remaining. However, it naturally let in dirt and debris that led to jams. Aimo Lahti experimented with a 60-round Thompson-type spring-loaded clockwork drum to replace it, but it was never adopted.

They were later replaced during the Continuation War with the Swedish-designed 50-round &quot;coffin&quot; magazine and improved 71-round drum. The &quot;coffin&quot; magazine carried more ammunition than the box magazine and was lighter than the 40-round drum. However, it was complicated and prone to jamming or failure if it was damaged, reassembled incorrectly, or the springs gave out. It would also fail to fire or feed unless it was properly seated in the magazine well. The &quot;coffin&quot; magazine was withdrawn from service in 1943 in favor of the 71-round drum. The larger drum was a design by the weapon&#x27;s less-well-known co-designer, Lieutenant Y. Koskinen, that was an improvement of the 40-round drum. It had a removable front-plate that was quicker to reassemble and was cocked by rotating the mainspring for up to four detents, allowing the drum to be partially reloaded. It was first released commercially in 1935 (eponymously named the &quot;M/Koskinen&quot; drum) and entered into Finnish service in January, 1936. In the 1950s the magazine wells on the KP/-31s were modified in order to use the Swedish Carl Gustav m/45b&#x27;s 36-round double-column magazine.

===Tactics===
Initially the KP/-31 was issued as a substitute for a light machine gun, however, it proved inadequate in that role. Instead, soldiers learned by trial and error how to use submachine guns to the best effect. By the time of the Continuation War, Finnish doctrine had been altered to include both a KP/-31 and a light machine gun (usually a captured Degtyaryov) in every infantry squad. By 1943 this had been expanded to two KP/-31s per squad. KP/-31 production continued with the intention of adding a third submachine gun to each squad, but this plan was shelved in 1944 when the Continuation War ended.

===Sales===

Finland focused on sales to South America and the Baltic States. It was sold to both sides during the Spanish Civil War; about 300 were confiscated by France from interned Republican troops in 1939. Estonia, France, and Poland bought some before World War Two that were later captured. Germany and their Axis allies Bulgaria and Croatia bought some after the war began. The German Armeeoberkommando Norwegen and Finnish SS Troops were issued the KP/-31 from Finnish stores. A weld-on magazine adapter was created by the Germans to convert MP38/MP40 magazines to feed in the KP/-31 to simplify logistics.

The Suomi KP was also manufactured under license. It was made in Sweden as the Husqvarna &quot;Kulsprutepistol&quot; Kpist M37 with a shorter 8.4-inch [213 mm] barrel. It was chambered for the weak 9mm Browning Long [9×20mmSR] cartridge, which required a rear-slanting magazine well. It used a 56-round four-column &quot;coffin&quot; magazine designed by Linde AB and manufactured by the Carl Gustav State Rifle Factory. They later adopted the redesigned Husquarna Kpist M37/39 chambered in 9mm Parabellum with a standard-length barrel [314mm] and 50-round &quot;coffin&quot; magazine. The Danish adopted it as the Madsen &quot;Maskinpistol&quot; M/41. It has distinctive protective metal “ears” on either side of the front post sight and used the 20-round magazine. The Swiss adopted it as the Hispano-Suiza &quot;Machinenpistole&quot; MP43 and issued it with the &quot;coffin&quot; magazine. The later MP43/44 had a fixed square notch rather than adjustable rear sights and the barrel jacket was modified to take a bayonet mount.

==Design==

The Suomi KP/-31 incorporated a few new design features. It had a quick-detachable barrel system and an arrangement whereby the spring was mounted inside the bolt in order to make the gun shorter.

The Carl Gustav 50-round quad-column &quot;casket&quot; box magazine was lighter and more reliable than the original Lahti 40-round &quot;ranger&quot; drum magazine. Similar applications were used on the Argentinian Hafdasa C-4 and Italian SITES Spectre M4 submachine guns. The Russian company PUFgun makes a 5.45×39mm 60-round AK-74-compatible all-polymer coffin magazine that was based on an abandoned Izhmash prototype.

== Variants ==
A number of different options and variations were offered through the export market. Two of those were a vertical front pistol grip and a folding bipod, which could be included together or independently. The Finnish police actually bought a small number of each type, and something like 50 to 100 guns were produced and sold with both features together – like this example.

A specialized bunker version was also produced in very small numbers (a total of 500 built) in 1941, the barrel shroud end of which was thinner and flattened to allow firing through the narrow ports of defensive bunkers. This version had no shoulder stock and was equipped with a pistol grip. An even rarer version &quot;900 kp 31 psv&quot; was produced for use as a secondary gun in the firing ports of Vickers Alt B Type E 6-Ton tanks, but only a few dozen were built before production was canceled due to the outbreak of the Winter War. Production never resumed, as captured Degtyaryov machine guns proved far superior in this role. Like the bunker version, the tank version had a pistol grip and no buttstock, and it could be quickly removed from the tank and fitted with a standard barrel shroud for infantry use if needed. The tank version remained in the Finnish Army&#x27;s inventory through the 1980s, despite the tank it was designed for being retired in 1959.

<text>Bikaner () is a city in the northwest of the state of Rajasthan, India. It is located northwest of the state capital, Jaipur. It is the administrative headquarters of Bikaner District and Bikaner division.

Formerly the capital of the princely Bikaner State, the city was founded by Rao Bika, a Rajput chief of the Rathore dynasty in 1488 CE and from its small origins it has developed into the fourth largest city in Rajasthan. The Ganga Canal, completed in 1928, and the Indira Gandhi Canal, completed in 1987, facilitated its development.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bikaner&quot; is a combination of two elements: &quot;Bika&quot;, derived from the city&#x27;s founder, Rao Bika and &quot;Ner&quot;, which is believed to mean &quot;place&quot; or &quot;city&quot; in the local Rajasthani language. Hence, &quot;Bikaner&quot; translates to &quot;the city of Bika&quot;.

==History==


Prior to the mid 15th century, the region that is now Bikaner was a barren wilderness called Jangladesh.

Rao Bika established the city of Bikaner in 1488. He was the first son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathore clan, the founder of Jodhpur and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner, in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the Thar Desert, Bikaner was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika&#x27;s name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (&quot;the settlement of Bika&quot;) that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5 km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.

Around a century after Rao Bika founded Bikaner, the state&#x27;s fortunes flourished under the sixth Raja, Rai Singhji, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the Mughal Empire&#x27;s rule in the country, Raja Rai Singh accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high rank as an army general at the court of the Emperor Akbar and his son, the Emperor Jahangir. Rai Singh&#x27;s successful military exploits, which involved winning half of Mewar kingdom for the Empire, won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was given the jagirs (lands) of Gujarat and Burhanpur. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Chintamani Durg (Junagarh fort) on a plain that has an average elevation of . He was an expert in arts and architecture, and the knowledge he acquired during his visits abroad is amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built at the Junagarh fort.

Maharaja Karan Singh, who ruled from 1631 to 1639, under the suzerainty of the Mughals, built the Karan Mahal palace. Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. Anup Singh, who ruled from 1669 to 1698, made substantial additions to the fort complex, including new palaces and the Zenana quarter, a royal dwelling for women and children. He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup Mahal. Maharaja Gaj Singh, who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon Palace).

During the 18th century, there was an internecine war between the rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also among other thakurs, which was put down by British troops.

Following Maharaja Gaj Singh, Maharaja Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and lavishly decorated the audience hall (see illustration) with glass and lively paintwork. Under a treaty of paramountcy signed in 1818, during Maharaja Surat Singh&#x27;s reign, Bikaner came under the suzerainty of the British, after which the Maharajas of Bikaner invested heavily in refurbishing Junagarh fort.
Dungar Singh, who reigned from 1872 to 1887, built the Badal Mahal, the &#x27;weather palace&#x27;, so named in view of a painting of clouds and falling rain, a rare event in arid Bikaner.

General Maharaja Ganga Singh, who ruled from 1887 to 1943, was the best-known of the Rajasthan princes and was a favourite of the British Viceroys of India. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India, served as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, represented India at the Imperial Conferences during the First World War and the British Empire at the Versailles Peace Conference. His contribution to the building activity in Junagarh involved separate halls for public and private audiences in the Ganga Mahal and a durbar hall for formal functions. He also built the Ganga Niwas Palace, which has towers at the entrance patio. This palace was designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob, the third of the new palaces built in Bikaner. He named the building Lalgarh Palace in honour of his father, and moved his main residence there from Junagarh Fort in 1902. The hall where he held his Golden Jubilee (in 1938) as Bikaner&#x27;s ruler is now a museum.

Ganga Singh&#x27;s son, Lieutenant-General Sir Sadul Singh, the Yuvaraja of Bikaner, succeeded his father as Maharaja in 1943, but acceded his state to the Union of India in 1949. Maharaja Sadul Singh died in 1950, being succeeded in the title by his son, Karni Singh (1924–1988). The Royal Family still lives in a suite in Lalgarh Palace, which they have converted into a heritage hotel.

<text>Mikrobitti (formerly called &quot;MB&quot;, &quot;MikroBitti&quot; and &quot;MikroBITTI&quot;) is a monthly Finnish computer magazine published in Helsinki, Finland.

==History and profile==
&quot;MikroBITTI&quot; was first published in May 1984. The original publisher was Tecnopress. Later it was published by Helsinki Media Company. Then the magazine was published monthly by Sanoma Magazines. The publishers were divisions of the Sanoma Group, since Sanoma purchased Tecnopress in 1984. &quot;MikroBitti&quot; is aimed mainly at beginner to mid-level computer users.

The computer platform coverage in &quot;MikroBitti&quot; has shifted according to the market and public interest over the years. Originally, in the mid-1980s, the magazine covered 8-bit home computers such as the Commodore 64, the MSX line and the ZX Spectrum. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the focus shifted to 16- and 32-bit home computers such as the Amiga and the Atari ST.

In the 8-bit era, &quot;MikroBitti&quot; was very hobby-oriented, presenting type-in programs for home computers and home electronics projects. Some columns, like the famous &quot;Peliluola&quot; by Nordic the Incurable, were written in a subculture insider style, and obscure in-jokes such as exploding hamsters were occasionally used. Many of the staff were fans of Star Trek: The Original Series and sometimes even wrote entire articles about the show, which had little or nothing to do with home computers.

In the 2000s, the magazine was renamed to &quot;MB&quot; and mainly covered PCs and games consoles. It also reviewed other hardware, such as digital cameras.

In 2015, Sanoma sold &quot;MB&quot; to Talentum, which had also acquired Sanoma&#x27;s other computer magazine &quot;Tietokone&quot; in 2013. In the process, the magazine was renamed to &quot;Mikrobitti&quot;. In September 2015 Alma Media Corporation acquired Talentum.

Risto Hieta became famous by the name Nordic the Incurable as the writer of the &quot;Peliluola&quot; (&quot;The Gaming Den&quot;) column in &quot;MikroBitti&quot;.

==Circulation==
In 2003 &quot;MikroBitti&quot; had the largest circulation figures of computer magazines published in the Nordic countries. The 2011 circulation of the monthly was 71,429 copies. The circulation was 42,866 copies in 2013 and 35,293 in 2016. In 2022, current readership calculation methods estimate the number of &quot;Mikrobitti&quot; readers at 74 000 (paper) and 198 000 (paper and digital).

==Summer camp==
In the 1980s, the &quot;MikroBitti&quot; staff used to hold an annual summer camp in Lautsia, a small village in the Tavastia Proper region in southern Finland. The camp was open to all &quot;MikroBitti&quot; readers, with a registration fee, and lasted about a week. Each day consisted of computer programming classes taught by the magazine staff. In the beginning, the class used various 8-bit computers such as the Commodore 64 and the MSX, but these were later replaced with Amiga computers. In the evening, the camp offered common summer camp outdoor activities, although attendees generally spent most of their free time playing computer games. The last summer camp was held in 1991. Jyrki Kasvi, a longtime contributor to &quot;MikroBitti&quot;, has mentioned having found many summer camp attendees at executive positions in Finnish IT companies.

==Illuminatus==
In 1989, &quot;MikroBitti&quot; reviewed a fictional German space-themed computer game &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, designed by one &quot;Jürgen Sternreise&quot; (which loosely translates to John Star Trek), as an April fools&#x27; joke. &quot;Illuminatus&quot; supposedly starts out as a single-player spaceflight simulator and then expands into a massive multi-player strategy game. It was hailed as the greatest game ever. The magazine staff had made up the entire story, including convincing screenshots. It was basically just a wish list of gaming greatness, but few readers seemed to realize this. Instead &quot;Illuminatus&quot; became a local phenomenon. Its name quickly appeared in Finnish mail order advertisements and even foreign distributors called the magazine to express interest in the game. Later there have been a couple of attempts to implement the fictional game, including one by Future Crew, which was not finished. Skrolli magazine independently implemented a playable demo of &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, based on recreated graphics from the 1989 &quot;MikroBitti&quot; article, and published it on the virtual cover disk of the first Skrolli International Edition in 2016.

==Mainstream shift==
Later, when the magazine grew more popular, its orientation and style became more mainstream. During the middle 2000s the magazine has branded itself more as a technology than a computer magazine. One of the latest moves was the complete removal of games section, and putting the remaining few game reviews and news among other hardware tests and news sections. For gamers this was unfortunate, because &quot;MikroBitti&quot; had always given large support to unusual games and independent publishers. The game section returned in the December issue, but the number of games reviewed is significantly lower than before. All the changes were related to the magazine &quot;HIFI&quot; and &quot;MikroBitti&quot; merging.

When Talentum bought the magazine in 2015, the new publisher changed the focus back on computers. In his first editorial, Editor-in-chief Mikko Torikka promised that the newly relaunched &quot;Mikrobitti&quot; won&#x27;t write about grass cutters and razors unless someone programs one to play Rick Astley&#x27;s Never Gonna Give You Up. (Soon one of the readers really made a shaver to play the song.)

==Spin-offs==
&quot;MikroBitti&quot; also produced spin-off magazines: &quot;C-lehti&quot;, &quot;Tietokonepelien vuosikirja&quot;, &quot;Pelit&quot; and &quot;Peliasema&quot;.

<text>In quantum mechanics, the consistent histories or simply &quot;consistent quantum theory&quot; interpretation generalizes the complementarity aspect of the conventional Copenhagen interpretation. The approach is sometimes called decoherent histories and in other work decoherent histories are more specialized.

First proposed by Robert Griffiths in 1984, this interpretation of quantum mechanics is based on a consistency criterion that then allows probabilities to be assigned to various alternative histories of a system such that the probabilities for each history obey the rules of classical probability while being consistent with the Schrödinger equation. In contrast to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, the framework does not include &quot;wavefunction collapse&quot; as a relevant description of any physical process, and emphasizes that measurement theory is not a fundamental ingredient of quantum mechanics. Consistent histories allows predictions related to the state of the universe needed for quantum cosmology.

==Key assumptions==
The interpretation rests on three assumptions:
#states in Hilbert space describe physical objects,
#quantum predictions are not deterministic, and 
#physical systems have no single unique description. 
The third assumption generalizes complementarity and this assumption separates consistent histories from other quantum theory interpretations.

==Formalism==
===Histories===

A &quot;homogeneous history&quot; formula_1 (here formula_2 labels different histories) is a sequence of Propositions formula_3 specified at different moments of time formula_4 (here formula_5 labels the times). We write this as:

formula_6

and read it as &quot;the proposition formula_7 is true at time formula_8 &quot;and then&quot; the proposition formula_9 is true at time formula_10 &quot;and then&quot; formula_11&quot;. The times formula_12 are strictly ordered and called the &quot;temporal support&quot; of the history.

&quot;Inhomogeneous histories&quot; are multiple-time propositions which cannot be represented by a homogeneous history. An example is the logical OR of two homogeneous histories: formula_13.

These propositions can correspond to any set of questions that include all possibilities.
Examples might be the three propositions meaning &quot;the electron went through the left slit&quot;, &quot;the electron went through the right slit&quot; and &quot;the electron didn&#x27;t go through either slit&quot;. One of the aims of the approach is to show that classical questions such as, &quot;where are my keys?&quot; are consistent. In this case one might use a large number of propositions each one specifying the location of the keys in some small region of space.

Each single-time proposition formula_3 can be represented by a projection operator formula_15 acting on the system&#x27;s Hilbert space (we use &quot;hats&quot; to denote operators). It is then useful to represent homogeneous histories by the time-ordered product of their single-time projection operators. This is the history projection operator (HPO) formalism developed by Christopher Isham and 
naturally encodes the logical structure of the history propositions.

===Consistency===

An important construction in the consistent histories approach is the class operator for a homogeneous history:

:formula_16

The symbol formula_17 indicates that the factors in the product are ordered chronologically according to their values of formula_4: the &quot;past&quot; operators with smaller values of formula_19 appear on the right side, and the &quot;future&quot; operators with greater values of formula_19 appear on the left side.
This definition can be extended to inhomogeneous histories as well.

Central to the consistent histories is the notion of consistency. A set of histories formula_21 is consistent (or strongly consistent) if

:formula_22

for all formula_23. Here formula_24 represents the initial density matrix, and the operators are expressed in the Heisenberg picture.

The set of histories is weakly consistent if 
:formula_25

for all formula_23.

=== Probabilities ===
If a set of histories is consistent then probabilities can be assigned to them in a consistent way. We postulate that the probability of history formula_1 is simply

:formula_28

which obeys the axioms of probability if the histories formula_1 come from the same (strongly) consistent set.

As an example, this means the probability of &quot;formula_1 OR formula_31&quot; equals the probability of &quot;formula_1&quot; plus the probability of &quot;formula_31&quot; minus the probability of &quot;formula_1 AND formula_31&quot;, and so forth.

==Interpretation==

The interpretation based on consistent histories is used in combination with the insights about quantum decoherence. 
Quantum decoherence implies that irreversible macroscopic phenomena (hence, all classical measurements) render histories automatically consistent, which allows one to recover classical reasoning and &quot;common sense&quot; when applied to the outcomes of these measurements. More precise analysis of decoherence allows (in principle) a quantitative calculation of the boundary between the classical domain and the quantum domain. According to Roland Omnès,
In order to obtain a complete theory, the formal rules above must be supplemented with a particular Hilbert space and rules that govern dynamics, for example a Hamiltonian.

In the opinion of others this still does not make a complete theory as no predictions are possible about which set of consistent histories will actually occur. In other words, the rules of consistent histories, the Hilbert space, and the Hamiltonian must be supplemented by a set selection rule. However, Robert B. Griffiths holds the opinion that asking the question of which set of histories will &quot;actually occur&quot; is a misinterpretation of the theory; histories are a tool for description of reality, not separate alternate realities.

Proponents of this consistent histories interpretation—such as Murray Gell-Mann, James Hartle, Roland Omnès and Robert B. Griffiths—argue that their interpretation clarifies the fundamental disadvantages of the old Copenhagen interpretation, and can be used as a complete interpretational framework for quantum mechanics.

In &quot;Quantum Philosophy&quot;, Roland Omnès provides a less mathematical way of understanding this same formalism.

The consistent histories approach can be interpreted as a way of understanding which sets of classical questions can be consistently asked of a single quantum system, and which sets of questions are fundamentally inconsistent, and thus meaningless when asked together. It thus becomes possible to demonstrate formally why it is that the questions which Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen assumed could be asked together, of a single quantum system, simply cannot be asked together. On the other hand, it also becomes possible to demonstrate that classical, logical reasoning often does apply, even to quantum experiments – but we can now be mathematically exact about the limits of classical logic.

<text>Dance Hall Crashers (often abbreviated to DHC) is an American ska punk band formed in 1989 in Berkeley, California. Initially founded by former Operation Ivy members Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, the band has had a fluid lineup over its career, with the most recent lineup (last active in 2004) includes Elyse Rogers and Karina Deniké on vocals, brothers Jason Hammon and Gavin Hammon on guitar and drums respectively, and Mikey Weiss on bass. They have released four studio albums, highlighted by the 1995 release &quot;Lockjaw&quot; which featured the minor hit song &quot;Enough&quot;, produced by Rob Cavallo and featured in the film &quot;Angus&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
The original incarnation of the Dance Hall Crashers (named after the Alton Ellis song &quot;Dance Crasher&quot;) was formed in 1989 by Matt Freeman and Tim Armstrong, formerly of the seminal Bay Area ska-punk band Operation Ivy, after both musicians expressed an interest in starting a band rooted in more traditional ska and rocksteady than what they had been playing with Operation Ivy. The first line-up featured Armstrong on vocals and Freeman on guitar, as well as drummer Erik Larsen (whom they specifically lured away from a rocksteady band called &quot;The Liquidators&quot;). The band also featured keyboardist Joey Schaaf, vocalists Ingrid Jonsson and Andrew Champion, guitarist Grant McIntire, and bassist Joel Wing.

The band experimented with various songs and styles until they played their first show at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley in 1989. Shortly after their debut, however, Freeman and Armstrong left to pursue other interests, mainly another punk-based ska project called Downfall.

After numerous membership changes which eventually left only the original drummer Larsen and bassist Wing, DHC solidified a line-up with dual vocalists Karina Schwarz and Elyse Rogers, guitarists Jason Hammon and Jaime McCormick, and drummer Gavin Hammon (Jason&#x27;s brother). Following a period of steady gigging, DHC finally caught a break after being booked at an all-ska Earth Day festival at Berkeley&#x27;s Greek Theatre in 1990, opening for Bad Manners. During this time they would occasionally open for The Toasters playing alongside other up-and-coming ska bands, including Let&#x27;s Go Bowling. That year, the band recorded their debut album for Moon Ska Records, though trouble within the band led to a break-up soon after. Elyse Rogers revealed in a 1993 interview with the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; prior to a show in Hawaii that part of the reason for the band&#x27;s breakup was a result of much of the band being under 21 years of age at that time, which prohibited those members from leaving the backstage area during shows.

===Breakthrough===
Their debut album became a word-of-mouth underground hit even with the band disbanded, and the group reunited in 1991 at Slim&#x27;s for a sold-out performance. In 1992, bowing to fan pressure, DHC reunited for a one-off series of gigs (occasionally playing alongside Hepcat), but after the positive response to their performance, the band chose to reform on a permanent basis. In 1993, to commemorate their reunion, Moon Records released a CD compilation of the band&#x27;s entire body of work from 1989 to 1992, appropriately titled &quot;1989–1992&quot;. The August 1993 lineup consisted of co-vocalists Elyse Rogers and Karina Schwarz, Jason Hammon and Scott Goodell on guitar and saxist Dean Olmstead; Rogers was also serving as Hepcat’s manager. A revised lineup in April 1994 added Jason Hammon&#x27;s brother Gavin on drums, Mikey Weiss (drums), plus John Pantle and Mason St. Peters (horn section). &quot;Go&quot;, which would later be incorporated into &quot;Lockjaw&quot;, was released exclusively to Hawaii in early-1994 as a cassette single.

As the band began touring nationally by the mid-1990s, the line-up changed once again, now featuring Rogers, Denike, Hammon, his brother Gavin Hammon on drums, guitarist Scott Goodell and bassist Mikey Weiss. In 1995, DHC were the very first group signed to MCA Records subsidiary 510 records, and issued their second LP &quot;Lockjaw&quot; the same year. &quot;Lockjaw&quot; was the first DHC release without a horn section, and had a harder, guitar-driven pop punk sound than the band&#x27;s prior recordings. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Enough&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Angus&quot;, and the accompanying music video received moderate airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Weiss recalls that he was working in a record store when &quot;Lockjaw&quot; was released; curious customers would ask about the band or their sound, and the other employees would point him out as the bass player.

A re-issue of &quot;1989–1992&quot; was released as &quot;The Old Record&quot; in late 1996 on Fat Wreck Chords&#x27; Honest Don&#x27;s label. DHC&#x27;s second MCA record, &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Homely!&quot;, was released in 1997. This proved to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, peaking at No. 22 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Heatseekers. The leading singles &quot;Lost Again&quot; and &quot;Mr. Blue&quot; enjoyed steady rotation on local and college radio stations across the United States, and music videos were filmed for both tracks.

The band toured extensively throughout the mid to late 1990s, both as a headliner and opening for bands such as The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Bad Religion, and The Lemons. In addition, the band played festivals such as the Warped Tour and Lilith Fair. Due to the heavy touring schedule, Scott Goodell bowed out from his guitar duties in 1996; the band asked Phil Ensor from Limp and later, Billy Bouchard to stand in for live shows until the need for a second guitarist was nixed and Hammon handled all guitar parts himself.

===Hiatus and reunions===
In 1998, DHC released their last release with MCA, the EP &quot;Blue Plate Special&quot;. The EP contained a short collection of songs recorded for other compilations/soundtracks, unreleased and remixed material, and a CD-ROM of photos and the band&#x27;s four music videos. In 1999, the band signed with independent label Pink and Black Records, releasing their fourth LP &quot;Purr&quot; in 1999 and the live album &quot;The Live Record: Witless Banter and 25 Mildly Antagonistic Songs About Love&quot; in 2000. 

DHC started playing less frequently in the early 2000s as band members either pursued higher education or moved on with their careers outside the band. They limited their performances to West Coast and Hawaiian shows and occasional appearances at events such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In November 2004, the band recorded a show at the Hollywood House of Blues which was later released on DVD by Kung Fu Records as part of their &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; series.

=== 2025 Warped Tour reunion ===
On January 26, 2025, DHC’s official Facebook account posted a reel with the Indian-head test pattern “Please Stand By” test card (featuring their black and white logo) with “Arrived” by CYoung playing in the background. The following day, January 27, a teaser video featuring Kevin Lyman and Elyse Rogers revealed that the band would be playing at the Vans Warped Tour in Washington, DC, and Long Beach, CA, later in 2025, ending a 21-year hiatus for the band. Karina Deniké announced in a video on January 28 that DHC would also be performing a show at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco on June 7. The official announcement also stated that no more shows would be added, saying &quot;If you are waiting for more announcements, they will not be coming. No other festivals, not (sic) other cities.&quot; However, a second show was added at the same venue on June 6 in an announcement made on the band&#x27;s official social media accounts.

<text>Craig Michael Conroy (born September 4, 1971) is an American former professional ice hockey player and the current general manager of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). A sixth-round selection of the Montreal Canadiens at the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, Conroy played 1,009 NHL games for the Canadiens, St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames and Los Angeles Kings during a professional career that spanned from 1994 to 2011. Internationally, he twice played with the United States National Team – at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Developed as a defensive specialist through much of his career, Conroy was twice a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward, and was nominated for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as its most gentlemanly player. He played over 1,000 games in the NHL and was the second-oldest player in League history to reach that milestone. Conroy, who enjoyed his greatest offensive seasons with the Flames, is a former captain of the team and was twice honored by the organization for his leadership, dedication and humanitarian efforts.

==Early life==
An only child, Conroy was born and raised in Potsdam, New York. He attended high school at Northwood School. His father Mike played minor league hockey for the Syracuse Blazers and at the age of four years Conroy served as the team&#x27;s mascot prior to games.

Conroy followed in the footsteps of his father and two uncles in playing hockey at Clarkson University for the Golden Knights. He enrolled at Clarkson in 1990 and played four seasons for the school. During his junior season of 1992–93, Conroy scored two goals in a 5–3 victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) semi-final to help lead his team to the conference championship game. Conroy reached 100 career points with the goals, joining his father Mike as the only such pair in Clarkson&#x27;s history to reach that milestone. Conroy and the Golden Knights then won the ECAC title with a 3–1 victory over Brown University.

The Golden Knights made Conroy a co-captain in his senior year of 1993–94. He led the ECAC in scoring with 66 points and was named to the conference&#x27;s First All-Star Team, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) First All-Star Team and the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament Team. He was also a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as top player in the NCAA, finishing second to Chris Marinucci. His Clarkson jersey (number 7) was retired in a ceremony prior to a game against College of Holy Cross on October 20, 2012, in which he and his family attended.

==Professional career==

===Montreal and St. Louis===
Conroy was selected in the sixth round, 123rd overall, at the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. He turned professional in 1994 upon completing his college career at Clarkson. At his first day of his first training camp with Montreal, he got into a fight with the team&#x27;s star goaltender, Patrick Roy, after striking the latter with a slap shot in practice. He spent the majority of the 1994–95 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Fredericton Canadiens, scoring 26 goals and 44 points in 55 games. He appeared in six games for Montreal that year. He played his first NHL game on February 15, 1995, against the Hartford Whalers, and scored his first goal one night later against the New York Rangers. Though he was an offensive star at Clarkson and Fredericton, the Canadiens sought to convert him to a defensive specialist in the NHL.

While he averaged over one point per game with Fredericton in 1995–96, Conroy again played only a handful of games with Montreal. He again began 1996–97 in the AHL, but was traded along with Pierre Turgeon and Rory Fitzpatrick to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Murray Baron, Shayne Corson and a draft pick on October 29, 1996. Conroy appeared in five games with the Worcester IceCats in the AHL, but after earning a recall to St. Louis, established himself as a regular in the NHL and appeared in 61 games with the Blues that season. Head Coach Joel Quenneville worked to develop Conroy&#x27;s abilities as a defensive forward and top faceoff specialist. Conroy responded in 1997–98 by improving to 43 points and a career-high plus-minus rating of +20. In recognition of his season, he was named a finalist for both the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as its most gentlemanly player.

Conroy remained one of the League&#x27;s top defensive forwards in 1998–99. While he missed several games with a high ankle sprain, he scored his first career hat-trick on February 26, 1999, against the Calgary Flames and finished sixth in Selke Trophy voting that season. He faced a difficult season in 1999–2000, however, as Joel Quenneville adopted a new strategy that abandoned the concept of a checking line. Conroy struggled at both ends of the ice, and frequently found his ice time limited as a result. He finished the season with just 27 points.

Looking to improve their team for a playoff run in 2000–01, the Blues dealt Conroy, along with a draft pick, to the Calgary Flames for Cory Stillman. The trade was initially unpopular in Calgary, as the Flames had given up their leading scorer for Conroy, who noted that that was when he &quot;learned not to read the papers or watch TV.&quot;

===Calgary and Los Angeles===
Opinion of the deal shifted considerably the following season as Conroy established himself as the Flames&#x27; first line center alongside Jarome Iginla. The pair developed good chemistry and became strong friends. Conroy scored career highs with 28 goals and 75 points, while Iginla reached the 50-goal plateau for the first time and led the NHL in scoring. Iginla credited Conroy for making his breakout season possible. Additionally, Conroy was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for a second time. The Flames named him a co-captain along with Bob Boughner late in the 2001–02 season, and he was the only captain in 2002–03.
Conroy was the Flames second-leading scorer in 2002–03 with 59 points and again in 2003–04 when he scored 47 points despite missing 19 games with a knee injury. Shortly before the 2003–04 season began, Conroy gave up the captaincy after having decided it was time for Iginla to take over leadership of the team. He reached two milestones that season; he scored his 300th career point against the Vancouver Canucks on November 29, 2003 and played his 600th game against the Detroit Red Wings on March 16, 2004. The Flames qualified for the 2004 playoffs, their first trip to the post-season in eight seasons. Conroy was a key player for the team as they upset the top three seeds in the Western Conference, the Canucks, Red Wings and San Jose Sharks en route to a seventh game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Finals. He finished second on the team in playoff scoring with 17 points. Following the season, Conroy was named to play with Team USA at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, but appeared in only two games for the team.

Conroy left the Flames as a free agent following the playoff run, opting to sign a four-year, US$12 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. He later admitted that he did not truly wish to leave the Flames, but facing financial uncertainty with the 2004–05 NHL lockout looming, Conroy chose to accept the guaranteed contract. The lockout wiped out the first year of the deal, but he returned in 2005–06 to reach the 20-goal mark for the third time and 60 points for the second time in his career. During that season, he joined the United States national team for a second time, playing in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He appeared in six games, scoring one goal and five points for the eighth place Americans.

Conroy struggled under new coach Marc Crawford early in the 2006–07 season, falling to five goals and 16 points in 52 games for the Kings before he was traded back to the Flames on January 29, 2007, in exchange for Jamie Lundmark and two draft picks. An emotional Conroy, who said he was happy to return to Calgary, scored two goals the following night in his second debut with the Flames to defeat his former Kings teammates, 4–1. Conroy finished the season by scoring 21 points in 28 games for Calgary, then scored 34 points in 2007–08.

The Flames re-signed Conroy to a new contract prior to the 2008–09 season and named him an alternate captain. He scored his 500th career point on January 3, 2009, when he assisted on Todd Bertuzzi&#x27;s game-winning goal in a 3–2 win against the Nashville Predators, and finished the year with 48 points. The 2009–10 season proved a difficult one for Conroy, as he scored only three goals and 12 assists during a season shortened by wrist and knee injures along with a broken foot. He returned for another season as the Flames re-signed him to a one-year, two-way contract for the League minimum of $500,000. At the age of 39 years, Conroy played his 1,000th NHL game, against the Colorado Avalanche, on October 28, 2010. Only Grant Ledyard was older (age 40) when he reached that milestone.

Conroy played only nine more games after passing the milestone, and last played on December 20 against the Minnesota Wild. A healthy scratch in 32 of 50 games, and 28 of his final 29, Conroy was waived on January 25, 2011. After going unclaimed, he was left with the option of joining Calgary&#x27;s AHL affiliate in Abbotsford or retiring. One week later, on February 4, 2011, Conroy formally announced his retirement.

==Post-playing career==

Upon his retirement, Conroy accepted a management position with the Flames organization, becoming the special assistant to General Manager Jay Feaster. On June 6, 2014, Conroy was promoted to the position of assistant general manager, reporting to GM Brad Treliving. On May 23, 2023, Conroy was announced as the eighth general manager in Flames history, following the departure of Treliving.

==Off the ice==

Conroy has a wife, Jessie, and three daughters, Taylor, Sophia and Sydney. Conroy and his family chose to remain in Calgary following his retirement as a player, though they had considered other options including returning to his hometown of Potsdam, New York.

Conroy spends his summers in Henderson Harbor, New York.

Conroy is known for his outgoing and talkative nature, traits that have made him a popular figure with the fans. The Flames honored Conroy with the J. R. &quot;Bud&quot; McCaig Award, given by the organization to individuals that show respect, courtesy and compassion, in 2008–09. He was also named him the winner of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 2010 in recognition of his charitable efforts. Additionally, his teammates voted him the organization&#x27;s nominee for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy which is awarded to the player who best exemplifies leadership and humanitarian contributions to their community. Conroy is the spokesman for the team&#x27;s charitable organization, the Flames Foundation for Life and routinely participates in team events.

<text>Brian Merriman or in Irish Brian Mac Giolla Meidhre (c. 1747 – 27 July 1805) was an 18th-century Irish language bard, farmer, hedge school teacher, and Irish traditional musician from rural County Clare.

Long after his death, Merriman&#x27;s life drew wide attention after his single surviving work of substance was collected from the local oral tradition, written down, and published for the first time. The poem is a 1000-line long parody of the Aisling, or Dream vision poetry tradition, the battle of the sexes, and Mythopoeic fictionalisations of Irish mythology: () (The Midnight Court).

The poem describes a lawsuit before the judicial bench of Aoibheal, a former goddess from Irish mythology who had been demoted to queen of the fairies since the Christianization the Irish people by Saint Patrick. In what has been described as, &quot;a battle of the sexes in fairyland&quot;, the women of Ireland are suing the men for refusing to get married and father children. The poet versifies the self-justifying arguments and bottomless self-pity of the morally bankrupt lawyers for both genders, which are then answered by the judge&#x27;s ruling that all laymen must marry before the age of 20 or face flogging at the hands of Ireland&#x27;s understandably frustrated and outraged women. The poet is saved from being the first flogging victim at the last minute by waking up and realizing that the trial was all a nightmare.

Brian Merriman&#x27;s &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; has been compared to the works of Ovid, Geoffrey Chaucer, Miguel de Cervantes, François Rabelais, Dante Alighieri, Jonathan Swift, Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, William Blake, Robert Burns, and Helen Fielding. It is widely regarded as the greatest work of Irish comic poetry and one of the most iconic works in the history of Irish literature in any language. Merriman&#x27;s parody of the fantasy genre and of the moral foibles of small town Gaels have also had many emulators; including Fr. Allan MacDonald, Liam O&#x27;Flaherty, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Flann O&#x27;Brien, and Seamus Heaney. Merriman&#x27;s poem has also been adapted at least twice into a stage play and once into an opera by living composer of Classical music Ana Sokolovic.

==Merriman&#x27;s life==
In accounts collected from the local oral tradition long after his death, Brian Merriman was said to have been born illegitimately in Clondagad or Ennistymon, County Clare. His father is said to have been either an outlawed and fugitive Roman Catholic priest who was on the run from the priest hunters, or an Anglo-Irish landlord. His mother, though, is known to have been surnamed Quilkeen.

Shortly after his birth, Merriman&#x27;s mother married a stonemason who was working on the walls of the Deer Park at Ennistymon House, which later became the Falls Hotel. The family moved to Feakle, where Merriman would have grown up travelling for illegal and secret religious worship to a Mass rock, which is still extant at the megalithic tomb in the nearby Ballycroum bog.

According to Daniel Corkery, it is still not known, &quot;how nor where&quot;, Brian Merriman, &quot;got his education. Perhaps in some hedge school, or intermittently at the feet of some wandering poet or priest, one bearing with him the relics of a nation&#x27;s culture, the other the credentials of Louvain or Salamanca.&quot;

Merriman is known, after he grew up, to have become the teacher of the illegal hedge school for the townland of Kilclaren. He is also said in the local oral tradition to have been a stout man with black hair with an interest in Irish traditional music and who was reportedly a very talented fiddler.

Also according to the local oral tradition, Brian Merriman was employed for a time as resident tutor to the children of a local Protestant and Anglo-Irish landlord.

According to Daniel Corkery, this would not have been uncommon at the time. The Irish language was still spoken so pervasively throughout 18th-century Ireland that many landlords and their families had to learn at least Irish to communicate with their household servants, tenant farmers, and hired labourers. Furthermore, the oral poetry composed in Munster Irish throughout the 18th century, which is replete with allusions to both Classical and Irish mythology, includes many of the greatest and most immortal works of Irish literature in the Irish language.

Corkery writes, therefore, &quot;Such men cannot be thought of as wayside singers who rhymes the local event. They were what they claimed to be, the literati of a people.&quot;

But it is unlikely that Merriman&#x27;s employers were aware of this fact or of their resident tutor&#x27;s enormous significance to Modern literature in Irish. As Daniel Corkery further writes, &quot;The first article in an Ascendancy&#x27;s creed is that the natives are a lesser breed and that anything that is theirs (except their land and their gold!) is therefore of little value. If they have had a language and a literature, it cannot have been a civilised language, cannot have been anything but a &quot;patois&quot; used by the hillmen among themselves; and as for their literature, the less said about it the better.&quot;

Corkery further explains that Merriman and other poets of the era like him, &quot;were all poor men, very often sore-troubled where and how to find shelter, clothing, food, at the end of a day&#x27;s tramping. Their native culture is ancient, harking back to pre-Renaissance standards; but there is no inflow of books from outside to impregnate it with new thoughts. Their language is dying: around them is the drip, drip of callous decay: famine overtakes famine, or the people are cleared from the land to make room for bullocks. The rocks in hidden mountain clefts are the only altars left to them; and teaching is a felony.&quot;

Even so, Corkery continues, the Irish-language poetry of the era, &quot;is, contrariwise, a rich thing, a marvellous inheritance, bright with music, flushed with colour, deep with human feeling. To see it against the dark world that threw it up, is to be astonished, if not dazzled.&quot;

According to the local oral tradition, Brian Merriman was inspired to compose &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot;, just as the poem describes, by having a nightmare while sleeping along the shores of Loch Gréine. According to other accounts, Merriman composed the poem while recovering from a leg injury that left him unable to work. As is the tradition in Irish culture, Merriman taught his poem to the local &quot;seanchaithe&quot;, who memorised it and passed it down generation after generation. Like many other works of Munster Irish poetry from the same era, &quot;The Midnight Court&quot;, according to Daniel Corkery, &quot;almost two hundred years after its creation, has been found alive on the lips of fishermen and ditchers!&quot;

According to Frank O&#x27;Connor, Brian Merriman &quot;was a fine poet&quot; and was every bit the equal of his contemporaries Jonathan Swift, Oliver Goldsmith, and Robert Burns. Ciaran Carson, however, has gone even farther and has compared Merriman&#x27;s mastery of language with that of Italian national poet Dante Alighieri.

According to Seán Ó Tuama, &quot;&quot;The Midnight Court&quot; is undoubtedly one of the greatest comic works of literature, and certainly the greatest comic poem ever written in Ireland. … It is a poem of gargantuan energy, moving clearly and pulsatingly along a simple story line, with a middle, a beginning and an end. For a poem of over one thousand lines it has few longeurs. It is full of tumultuous bouts of great good humour, verbal dexterity and rabelesian ribaldry. It is a mammoth readable achievement with little need of gloss.&quot;

Of the poem&#x27;s infamous bawdiness, William Butler Yeats, &quot;Had Mac Giolla Meidhre before his mind the fires of Saint John&#x27;s Night, for all through Munster men and women leaped the fires that they might be fruitful, and after scattered the ashes that the fields might be fruitful also? Certainly it is not possible to read his verses without being shocked and horrified as city onlookers were perhaps shocked and horrified at the free speech and buffoonery of some traditional country festival. He wrote at a moment of national discouragement: the Penal Laws were still in force though weakening, the old order was a vivid memory, but, with the failure of the last Jacobite rising, hope of its return had vanished, and no new political dream had come.&quot;

As the morally bankrupt lawyer for the women famously urges him to do in the poem, Merriman married Feakle resident Kathleen Collins around 1787 and became the father of two daughters. Some years later, possibly due to relaxation of Penal Laws forbidding Catholics from owning land by the 1793 Catholic Relief Act, Merriman is known to have owned a 20-acre (81,000 m2) farm near Loch Gréine. In 1797, the Royal Dublin Society awarded Merriman two prizes for his flax crop.

Around 1800, the Merriman family moved to Limerick City. According to the oral tradition, Merriman moved his family because he feared that his prosperous farm in Feakle might cause local men to kidnap his two beautiful daughters for the purposes of forced marriage. In Limerick City, Merriman continued to teach.

Brian Merriman died on Saturday 27 July 1805. His death was recorded two days later in the &quot;General Advertiser and Limerick Gazette&quot;: &quot;Died – on Saturday morning, in Old Clare-street, after a few days&#x27; illness, Mr Bryan Merryman, teacher of Mathematics, etc.&quot; About Merriman&#x27;s death, Frank O&#x27;Connor has alleged, incorrectly, &quot;Irish literature in the Irish language may be said to have died with him.&quot;

Yeats, on the other hand, wrote, &quot;Standish Hayes O&#x27;Grady has described &quot;The Midnight Court&quot; as the best poem written in Gaelic, and as I read Mr. Ussher&#x27;s translation I have felt, without sharing what seems to me an extravagant opinion, that Mac Giolla Meidhre, had political circumstances been different, might have founded a modern Gaelic literature.&quot;

At his own request, Brian Merriman&#x27;s body was returned to his native district and now lies buried in Feakle graveyard. In August 1992, a stone monument to Brian Merriman, with the opening lines of &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; carved in Irish, was dedicated by Seamus Heaney and still stands overlooking the site of the 18th-century Bard&#x27;s famous nap along the shores of Loch Gréine.

Furthermore, in 2018, Irish dialectologist Brian Ó Curnáin announced the discovery of an 1817 manuscript of &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; in the archives of the Royal Irish Academy. The manuscript, which is signed Éamann Ó hOrchaidh, renders the poem not into the County Clare dialect of the Munster Irish spoken by Brian Merriman, but into the now-extinct dialect of Connacht Irish formerly spoken in County Roscommon. The discovery is regarded as priceless in what it reveals of a now vanished dialect of the Irish language.

==&quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot;==

In the opening section of the poem, the poet declares his love for walking alone in the countryside of County Clare, which he describes lyrically. After walking past a red fox being pursued by hunters on horseback, the poet walks to the shore of Loch Gréine and lays down to take a nap in a ditch. Then, a hideous giantess appears, who carries a staff to which a bailiff&#x27;s warrant has been nailed. The giantess wakes up the poet, scolds him for sleeping in a ditch while court is in session, and drags him kicking and screaming into the presence of Aoibheal, the Queen of all the Fairies in County Clare.

On the way to the ruined church at Moynoe, the giantess explains that the Queen is disgusted by the destruction of the clan system, the Flight of the Wild Geese, the exile or outlawry of the Clan Chiefs, and their replacement by lowborn but greedy Protestant and Anglo-Irish landlords, &quot;who pick the bones of the Irish clean.&quot; Furthermore, the Queen is also horrified by how the judges invariably twist English Law to always support the new Protestant Ascendancy. The giantess further explains that Aoibheal is even more concerned that Ireland&#x27;s men are refusing to marry and father children and that if something is not done, the Irish people will face extinction. Therefore, the Queen is taking the implementation of justice upon herself. When the giant and the Bard arrive at the ruined church, there follows a traditional court case under the Brehon law form of a two-part debate followed by the judge&#x27;s ruling.

In the first part, a young woman declares her case against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She complains that despite increasingly desperate flirtation at hurling matches, wakes, and pattern days, the young men insist on ignoring her in favour of late marriages to richer, older, uglier, and often extremely shrewish women. The young woman describes at length her use of pishogues, Satanism, and black magic, which have also failed to gain her a husband. The young woman then bewails the contempt with which she is treated by the married women of the village.

She is answered by an old man who first denounces the wanton promiscuity of young women in general, suggesting that the young woman who spoke before was conceived by a Tinker in a ditch. He vividly describes the infidelity of his own young wife. He declares his humiliation at finding her already pregnant on their wedding night and the gossip which has surrounded the &quot;premature&quot; birth of &quot;his&quot; son ever since. Then, however, the old man declares that there is nothing wrong with his wife&#x27;s illegitimate children and denounces marriage as &quot;out of date.&quot; He demands that the Queen outlaw it altogether and replace it with a system of free love.

The young woman, however, is infuriated by the old&#x27; man&#x27;s words and is barely restrained from physically assaulting him.

The young woman explains that the old man&#x27;s wife was a homeless beggar who married him to avoid starvation. She graphically describes the many, many attempts that the old man&#x27;s wife made to consummate the marriage, only to find her elderly husband impotent. She tells the old man that if his wife has taken a lover, she well deserves one. The young woman then calls for the abolition of priestly celibacy, alleging that priests would otherwise make wonderful husbands and fathers. She declares that many lonely women are already being &quot;consoled&quot; by priests, who are regularly fathering children under other men&#x27;s names. In conclusion, the young woman declares that she will keep trying to attract an older man in hopes that her unmarried humiliation will finally end.

Finally, in the judgement section, Queen Aoibheal announces that there is nothing wrong with marriage and that she admires men who work hard every day to provide for their families. She, therefore, rules that all laymen must marry before the age of 21, on pain of flogging at the hands of Ireland&#x27;s women. She advises the women to equally target the romantically indifferent, homosexuals, and rakes who boast of the numbers of single and married women whose lives they have ruined. Aoibheal tells the women to be careful, however, not to flog any man until he is unable to father children. She also states that abolishing priestly celibacy is beyond her mandate. She expresses a belief, however, that the Pope will soon allow priests to openly act on their carnal urges and counsels patience until then.

To the poet&#x27;s horror, the young woman angrily points him out as a 30-year-old bachelor and describes her many failed attempts to become his wife. She declares that, despite the poet&#x27;s crooked back and extreme ugliness, none of that would matter in a darkened bedroom. She therefore demands that Merriman must be the first man to suffer the consequences of the new marriage law. As a crowd of infuriated single women gleefully prepares to flog Brian Merriman into a quivering bowl of jelly, he awakens along the shore of Loch Gréine to find it was all a terrible nightmare.

==Influence==
===Language and metre===
The language of Merriman&#x27;s poem is a mixture of the Classical Gaelic literary language of the Bards with everyday Munster Irish, the vernacular of rural County Clare during the late 18th century. The meter is the rarely used Dactylic Trimeter followed by a single Trochaic foot. The end rhymes are all feminine.

In a 1926 preface to Arland Ussher&#x27;s translation, William Butler Yeats wrote, &quot;Brian Mac Giolla Meidhre – or to put it in English, Brian Merriman – wrote in Gaelic, one final and three internal rhymes, pouring all his mediaeval abundance into that narrow neck.&quot;

===Classical studies===
At least two lines from Merriman&#x27;s poem have been identified as very close translations of the erotic poetry of Ovid into Munster Irish. Although it was once widely assumed that Gaelic Ireland completely missed Renaissance humanism and the revival of interest in the Classics, this is not surprising. Pioneering antiquarian and Celticist Charles O&#x27;Conor of Bellanagare (1710 - 1791), a descendant of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland, received his early education at a hedge school taught by the surviving Franciscans of Creevelea Abbey and later recalled in his memoirs that he was taught the Latin language using the grammar of Corderius, and the writings of Ovid, Suetonius, and Erasmus.

Furthermore, Aoibheal&#x27;s ultimate ruling at the climax of Merriman&#x27;s poem, that all single men either marry or face flogging by the local women, represents a revival of the traditional form of social pressure used against unmarried men in the ancient Greek &quot;Polis&quot; of Sparta. As the teaching of the Greek language, using similarly ancient texts as those used to teach Latin, was just as common in Irish hedge schools at the time, Merriman as a hedge schoolmaster was almost certainly aware of the tradition regarding Spartan men who spurned marriage well before composing his poem.

===The Poetic Courts===
According to Daniel Corkery, in 18th century Munster, a custom similar to the Welsh Eisteddfod existed. In what was also both mimicry and satire of the ceremonial of the English-dominated legal and court system, the Chief-Bard of a district would preside over sessions of a &quot;Cúirt&quot;, or Poetic Court. Like the trial in Merriman&#x27;s poem, a Munster &quot;Cúirt&quot; would begin with &quot;bailiffs&quot; delivering often humorously worded &quot;warrants&quot; which summoned local Irish-language poets to a Bardic competition presided over by the Chief-Bard as &quot;judge&quot;. In many cases, two Irish-language poets at the &quot;Cúirt&quot; would engage in Flyting; a mixture of debate poetry and the improvised trading of insults in verse, much like that between the two lawyers in Merriman&#x27;s poem. Also according to Corkery, much of the serious, improvised, and comic poetry in the Irish-language composed for sessions of the Munster Poetic Courts was written down by the Court &quot;Recorders&quot; and still survives.

===Satire of Jacobite poetry===

The poem begins by satirizing the Mythopoeic conventions of the Aisling, or Dream vision poem. According to Daniel Corkery, &quot;The Aisling proper is Jacobite poetry; and a typical example would run something like this: The poet, weak with thinking of the woe that has overtaken the Gael, falls into a deep slumber. In his dreaming a figure of radiant beauty draws near. She is so bright, so stately, the poet imagines her one of the immortals. Is she Deirdre? Is she Gearnait? Or is she Helen? Or Venus? He questions her, and learns that she is Erin; and her sorrow, he is told, is for her true mate who is in exile beyond the seas. This true mate is, according to the date of the composition, either the Old or Young Pretender; and the poem ends with a promise of speedy redemption on the return of the King&#x27;s son.&quot;

According to Ciarán Carson, &quot;Merriman subverted all that. His fairy woman is not beautiful, but a threatening monster. The vision that she discloses is not of a future paradise, but a present reality. Merriman&#x27;s poem, for all its rhetorical and satirical extravagance, gives us a real sense of what life must have been like in 18th century Ireland: its people and their speech, their gestures, their dress, their food and drink, their recreations, and, of course, their sexual mores. The atmosphere of the &#x27;court&#x27; is not so much that of a court of law, but of a country market, filled with verbal commotion and colour. For all that, it is still a dream-world, where Merriman can free himself from the restraints of conventional discourse, swooping from high rhetoric to street-talk in the space of a few lines – much as Dante did in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, which is also an aisling. And language is very much a concern of the aisling: a recurrent theme is the poet&#x27;s lament for the decline of Irish, and its support mechanism of noble patronage.&quot;

===Alleged satire of Christian morality===
Ciarán Carson writes that the Old Man&#x27;s praise of illegitimacy before the Court bolsters the oral tradition of County Clare, which alleges that Brian Merriman was born out of wedlock. Carson also writes that some literary scholars believe Merriman may have been aware of the similar sentiments expressed in the 1728 poem &quot;The Bastard&quot; by Richard Savage.

While Yeats points out the plot similarities between &quot;The Midnight Court&quot; and Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Cadenus and Vanessa&quot;, he also expresses a belief that Merriman was mainly inspired by Irish folklore and mythology, particularly the love stories told about the demigods Cuchulain and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne and anti-Christian debate poetry such as the, &quot;old dialogues where Oisín railed at Patrick.&quot; Yeats argued that Merriman&#x27;s poem may be considered, &quot;more than the last song of Irish Paganism,&quot; but as similar to other works of religious satire from the so-called Age of Reason, including Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Holy Willie&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, &quot;Address to the Deil&quot;, and William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;.

In response to the same accusations that Brian Merriman must have read and emulated the anti-Christian writings of Voltaire and other similar writers of the era, Vivian Mercier, like Yeats, has argued that Merriman was using the conventions of Irish traditional literature to make fun of the moral failings of the Irish people during his own era. For example, when mentioning the moment when the female lawyer taunts Brian Merriman for being thirty years old and still unmarried, Vivian Mercier points out that the women of the Aran Islands taunted John Millington Synge in exactly the same way. The male and female lawyers&#x27; denunciations of unhappy marriages, whether they were entered into for the wrong or the right reasons, are also part of a very old and long established tradition in Irish literature in the Irish language. To drive this point home, Mercier, drawing upon a 1913 article by literary scholar T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly, which cites many other works of both Irish bardic poetry and Seán nos songs whose narrators are every bit as bawdy, blasphemous, narcissistic, and seemingly nihilistic as the two lawyers and the judge in Merriman&#x27;s poem. Like O&#x27;Rahilly before him, Mercier singles out for particular attention &quot;An Seanduine&quot; (&quot;The Old Man&quot;), &quot;An tSeanbhean&quot; (&quot;The Old Woman&quot;), &quot;An tArrachtach Sean&quot; (&quot;The Old Monster&quot;), and &quot;An Fear Brónach d&#x27;éis a Phósda&quot; (&quot;The Sorrowful Man After His Marriage&quot;).

In a 1993 lecture on Brian Merriman&#x27;s life and work, Seamus Heaney expressed a then commonly held belief that Brian Merriman supported the &quot;solutions&quot; argued by the two lawyers: the complete rejection of Christian morality by the Gaels, the end of sexual repression through the embrace of free love, and allowing, &quot;the psychosexual demons&quot; to run rampant; a dream which Heaney described as fulfilled by the Secularization of Ireland since the 1960s.

In a 2006 review for &quot;The Guardian&quot; of Ana Sokolovic&#x27;s new operatic adaptation of the poem, Tom Service expressed a very similar interpretation of Brian Merriman&#x27;s literary intentions, which Service termed a, &quot;plea for sexual liberation&quot;, &quot;a battle of the sexes in fairyland&quot;, and, &quot;a radical critique of the repressive Catholic Church in the 18th century&quot;. Service, however, harshly criticized the female lawyer as, &quot;a petulant, infantile 18th-century Bridget Jones, complaining that despite her charms, she can find no one to marry&quot;, and termed the character of the men&#x27;s lawyer nothing short of, &quot;odious&quot;. Service lamented, however, that, &quot;In the 21st [century], the moral of the story seems quaint and anachronistic.&quot;

Similarly to Piaras Beaslai, who had alleged in 1913, &quot;Brian [Merriman] was essentially a moralist&quot;, Vivian Mercier disagreed strongly with those who interpreted &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche &quot; as a call for sexual revolution. According to Mercier, Merriman was drawing upon a centuries-old tradition in Irish language satirical poetry, such as the hugely influential &quot;Pairlement Chloinne Tomáis&quot; and Egan O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s &quot;Eachtra Thaidhg Dhuibhne Uí Chróinín&quot;; which were both composed as lampoons against the small minority of lower class Gaels who enriched themselves by converting to Puritanism and collaborating with the new elite against their own people during and after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. According to Mercier, it is a long established tradition in such poems that an unsympathetic character or characters speaks very similarly to the male and female lawyers and accordingly, &quot;convicts [themselves] out of [their] own mouth&quot;. It is very possible if not highly likely, therefore, that like many other bawdy and seemingly blasphemous and nihilistic poets in Munster Irish from the same era, that Brian Merriman, &quot;was no more anti-Christian than Villon&quot;, or Chaucer.

===Significance===
Due to Merriman&#x27;s mockery of a dystopian Ireland where the practice of Christian morality has been replaced by all of the Seven Deadly Sins, his satirical treatment of the battle of the sexes, and his devastating social commentary, &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Óiche&quot; is a truly unique work in the history of Irish poetry in either language.

==Legacy==
===Literary and cultural legacy===
Like much Irish and Scottish Gaelic oral poetry &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; was preserved mainly by being memorized by successive generations of local &quot;seanchaithe&quot; although a manuscript of the poem written by Merriman himself does exist in Cambridge University Library. It was eventually published in 1850, by the Irish language poetry collector John O&#x27;Daly. Both before and since its first publication, Merriman&#x27;s masterpiece has had an enormous literary influence.

In his comic verse drama in Scottish Gaelic, &quot;Parlamaid nan Cailleach&quot; (&quot;The Parliament of Hags&quot;), Roman Catholic priest Fr. Allan MacDonald (1959–1905) of Eriskay lampoons the gossiping of his female parishioners and the courtship and marriage customs of the Hebrides. Ronald Black, a well known scholar of Scottish Gaelic literature, has compared the play to similar works comic poetry from Irish literature in the Irish language, such as Domhnall Ó Colmáin&#x27;s 1670 &quot;Párliament na mBan&quot; (&quot;The Women&#x27;s Parliament&quot;) and Brian Merriman&#x27;s 1780 &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; (&quot;The Midnight Court&quot;).

In recent years, Merriman&#x27;s poem and other Irish and Scottish Gaelic comic poetry have been admired, praised, and emulated by modern Irish poets, including Seamus Heaney and Thomas Kinsella.

The influence Merriman&#x27;s Cervantes-esque parody of the fantasy genre may also be seen in the iconic 1938 metafictional, magical realist, and satirical novel &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; by Flann O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien, a career official of the Irish civil service following the War of Independence, had studied Irish language comic literature at University College Dublin and accordingly wrote about a novelist whose characters, many of whom, similarly to Aoibheal, are extremely brutal parodies of revered figures from Irish folklore and mythology, are so outraged by their author&#x27;s terrible writing that they revolt against him and plot his early demise to have control over their own lives.

In Modern literature in Irish, Merriman&#x27;s influence is also seen in the equally iconic 1948 novel &quot;Cré na Cille&quot;, by Máirtín Ó Cadhain. The whole novel takes place during Irish neutrality in the Second World War and is written in the voices of the dead bodies buried in a rural Connemara cemetery, who remain conscious inside their coffins. The dead proceed, however, to spend the whole novel viciously quarrelling with one another about past events in their lives and romantic relationships, about who was right and who was wrong during the Irish Civil War, and, most of all, about the social status or lack thereof of the speakers when they were still alive in their local parishes and villages.

===Literary translations===
In the 20th century, a number of translations were produced. Translators have generally rendered &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Óiche&quot; into iambic pentameter and heroic couplets. Ciarán Carson, however, chose to closely reproduce Merriman&#x27;s original dactylic meter, which he found very similar to the 6/8 rhythm of Irish jigs, and heavy use of alliteration.

According to Frank O&#x27;Connor, a German translation of &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Óiche&quot; also exists.

Notable English versions have been made by Anglo-Irish poets Arland Ussher, Edward Pakenham, 6th Earl of Longford, and by the Irish Jewish poet David Marcus. A free verse translation has been made by Thomas Kinsella and a partial rhymed translation by Seamus Heaney. Brendan Behan is believed to have written an unpublished version, since lost.

Frank O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s translation into heroic couplets, which is the most popular, was banned by the Censorship Board of the Irish State in 1945. Soon after, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s translation was attacked in print and O&#x27;Connor replied. O&#x27;Connor alleges that the subsequent debate in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;on the banning of my translation... would make a substantial and informing booklet.&quot; The debate began when Professor James Hogan of the National University of Ireland claimed to have found, after reading &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Óiche&quot; in a literary translation into German, that O&#x27;Connor had introduced a blasphemous line that wasn&#x27;t in the original text. O&#x27;Connor responded in print that Professor Hogan did not know enough German to read an Irish language poem in the original. O&#x27;Connor also wrote that everything in his translation that the Irish State considered to be obscene was also present in Merriman&#x27;s original poem in Irish. In his book, &quot;A Short History of Irish Literature&quot;, O&#x27;Connor cites the banning of his translation among several other examples of the crippling effect that the wartime censorship imposed by Taoiseach Éamon de Valera was having upon Irish literature.

At the same time, however, Frank O&#x27;Connor later published his formerly banned translation in &quot;Kings, Lords, and Commons: An Anthology from the Irish&quot;, a 1958 collection of his Irish-English poetry translations, which spanned what he considered the whole literary canon, from the first millennium to the 1805 death of Brian Merriman in Limerick City. Writing during the late 1960s, Terence de Vere White commented that, &quot;&quot;Kings, Lords, and Commons&quot; had a wide readership in Britain as well as in Ireland and the United States&quot;. Terence de Vere White according credits Frank O&#x27;Connor, through that single volume, with, &quot;opening English eyes to the existence&quot;, and the achievements of Irish poetry in the Irish language.

In a review for &quot;The Guardian&quot; of Ciarán Carson&#x27;s 2006 translation of &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Óiche&quot;, David Wheately wrote, &quot;When it came to translating Merriman&#x27;s poem, the temptation might have been to put its four-stressed lines into Swiftian octosyllabics, but instead he has opted for the hop, step and jump of an anapestic beat. According to Carson&#x27;s introduction, however, his real inspiration was the 6/8 rhythm of Irish jigs, which as a fiddler himself Merriman would have known well. ... The alphabet soup of earlier Carson books such as &quot;First Language&quot; serves him well here with the alliterative riffing of the Gaelic metre (befuddled and boozed in a bibulous Babel)... For all its problems with the censor, Frank O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s version is the drawing room performance; this one&#x27;s for the shebeen in the wee small hours.&quot;

In an article about his own translation of Merriman&#x27;s poem, Ciaran Carson wrote, &quot;On the morning of New Year&#x27;s Day 2005 – the year of the 200th anniversary of Merriman&#x27;s death – I dreamed about Merriman. I was wandering on a dark hillside when I saw a light in the distance. I followed it, and came to a little house. The door was ajar; timidly, I pushed it open. Merriman was sitting by the hearth, wearing a greatcoat. He gestured at me to sit down. I did so, and we conversed. True, he did most of the talking, but I was fully able to follow the flow of his intricate Irish. I cannot remember what was said. When I awoke, I was disappointed to find my Irish restored to its former poverty. But I felt that I had been touched, just a little, by the hand of the Master.&quot;

===Legacy in County Clare===
&quot;Cumann Merriman&quot; was founded in 1967 to promote the poet&#x27;s work. They run an annual Merriman Summer School in County Clare each August. John Ardagh, who visited the annual Merriman festival in the region during the 1990s, described the event as, &quot;very merry.&quot;

In 2005, the Clare County Library released a CD recording of a local seanchaí reciting &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Óiche&quot; in the traditional oral manner. Although it has not been made available for purchase, &quot;Cumann Merriman&quot; has posted excerpts on their website. For added contrast, the same passages are also reproduced from a modern dramatic reading of the poem.
At the end of a 1993 lecture on Merriman&#x27;s life and work, Seamus Heaney declared, &quot;Perhaps I can convey the ongoing reality of the poem&#x27;s life more simply by recollecting a Saturday evening last August when I had the privilege of unveiling a memorial to Brian Merriman on the shore of Lough Graney in Co. Clare, where the opening scene of &#x27;The Midnight Court&#x27; is set. The memorial is a large stone quarried from a hill overlooking the lake, and the opening lines are carved on it in Irish. The people who attended the ceremony were almost all from the local district, and were eager to point out the exact corner of the nearby field where the poet had run his hedge school, and the spot on the lough shore where he had fallen asleep and had his vision. This was, and is, the first circle where Merriman&#x27;s poem flourished and continues to flourish. Later that evening, for example, in a marquee a couple of miles down the road, we attended a performance by the Druid Theatre Company from Galway in which the poem was given a dramatic presentation with all the boost and blast-off that song and music and topical allusion could provide. Again, hundreds of local people were in the tent, shouting and taking sides like a football crowd, as the old man and the young woman battled it out and the president of the court gave her judgement. The psychosexual demons were no longer at bay but rampant and fully recognised, so that the audience, at the end of the performance, came away from the experience every bit as accused and absolved as the poet himself at the end of his poem. The &#x27;profane perfection of mankind&#x27; was going ahead and civilisation was being kept on course; in a ceremony that was entirely convincing and contemporary, Orpheus has been remembered in Ireland.&quot;

Pál Kinizsi ({{langx|la|Paulus de Kenezy}}; {{langx|ro|Paul Chinezu}}; 1432–1494) was a Hungarian general in the service of Hungarian army under king Matthias Corvinus. He was the Count of Temes County (in the historical Banat region, in the Kingdom of Hungary now part of Romania and Serbia after annexation at the Treaty of Trianon) from 1484 and Captain-General of the Lower Parts. He was a general of King Mathias&#x27;s famed Black Army. He is famous for his victory over the Ottomans in the Battle of Breadfield in October 1479. He reputedly never lost a battle.

==Life==

===Origin and early life===
Kinizsi&#x27;s ancestry is obscure. According to some he was a son of a miller, and prior to his military career, he was a journeyman miller. According to some Serbian historians, he was of Serbian origin, and was possibly a descendant of Vuk Branković, though this could not be determined.

The first mention of his name is in 1464, in a Latin written document mentioning that {{lang|la|Egrenius}} (His Excellency) {{lang|la|Paulus de Kenezy}} receives a possession in the Abaúj County. Later in 1510, appears also in form of {{lang|la|Paulo de Kynys Comiti Themesiensi et Generali Capetaneo partium Regni nostrum inferiorum}}.

===Military career===
His central estate was the Castle of Nagyvázsony since 1472 until his death.

After the death of king Matthias in 1490 he supported the Bohemian king Vladislas II of Hungary and the great magnates against Matthias&#x27; illegitimate son and designated successor John Corvinus. Kinizsi defeated the army of John Corvinus in the battle of Bonefield. He destroyed the former king&#x27;s mercenary Black Army (battle of Halászfalva) which had become a robber band after its dissolution.
He then was crippled by a stroke and died shortly afterwards. 
He is one of the few generals in history who never lost a battle.

==Family==
He married Benigna Magyar,{{sfn|Országos Széchényi Könyvtár|1972|p=21}} the daughter of Blaise Magyar, another general of Corvinus.

==Titles==
*&quot;Count of Temes&quot; ({{langx|la|comes Temesiensis}})
*&quot;Captain General of the Lower Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot; ({{langx|la|generalis capitaneus inferiorum partium regni}})

==Folklore==
In legends, he is known as a commoner. Kinizsi is a hero of some Hungarian and Romanian folk tales along with king Matthias Corvinus as an extremely strong former miller&#x27;s apprentice. According to these tales, the king was hunting in the Bakony forest near the mill where he worked and asked for a drink; Kinizsi, to show his strength, served the cup on a millstone. The king, impressed, took him into his service, where Kinizsi&#x27;s strength, prowess and loyalty earned him rapid promotion. He is said to have wielded two greatswords in battle and to have danced a victory dance after the Battle of Kenyérmező with a captured or dead Turk under each arm and a third held with his hair or belt in his teeth.

==Honors==
Chinezul Timișoara was a football club, which played both in the Romanian and the Hungarian championship during its existence. It was based in Timișoara, Romania (at the time of foundation Temesvár, Austria-Hungary).

Postage stamps: Pál Kinizsi postage stamps were issued by Hungary on 1 January 1943 and in 1945. This same stamp was surcharged 28 fillér on 5 fillér and issued in 1945.

<text>Clayton South is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 20 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Clayton South recorded a population of 13,381 at the .

The suburb sometimes goes by the name Westall, due to the name of the main road and the railway station that serve the area. Westall is, however, &quot;not&quot; an official name, and all post addressed to the area is addressed to Clayton South.

==History==

Settlement of the area dates from the mid 1800s, with land used mainly for farming and market gardening.

The area was once coastal heathland and first occupied by John O&#x27;Shannessy during the early 1840s, who took a squatting licence to encompass a 40,000-acre (160 km2) block, around suburbs known today as Clarinda, Clayton South, Dingley and Heatherton. O’Shannessy later passed on his licence to John and Richard King, in 1846, which saw the transformation of the area. Some growth took place during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

The area was also used for market gardening, although there was a considerable amount of swampy or unimproved land when the Forest Hill Golf Club acquired an area for its Spring Valley golf course in 1948. The golf course is one of several in the sand belt country, extending from Huntingdale to Dingley Village. Residential settlement and industrial growth began during the late 1950s. Notable developments were the Volkswagen assembly plant adjoining the Westall railway station, and cable-making and bakery establishments. The Clayton South primary school had been opened in 1929 for the farming community, but the postwar residential growth required the opening of Westall primary and high schools in 1961 and 1963.

Clayton South Post Office opened on 15 July 1929 and closed in 1976. Westall Post Office opened in 1960 near the station and closed in 1971.

Significant development occurred from the post-war years, with rapid growth during the 1960s and 1970s. The population declined slightly between 1991 and 2006, a result of few new dwellings being added to the area and a decline in the average number of persons living in each dwelling. The population and dwelling stock then increased slightly between 2006 and 2011.

Immediately west of Clayton South is Clarinda. During 1960s to 1980s it was regarded as a locality of Clayton South, but in the late 1990s it emerged as a separate suburb. Clayton South thus sits between Springs and Westall Roads. In any event Clarinda&#x27;s shopping centre serves much of Clayton South. Other shopping areas for Clayton South&#x27;s residents are at Clayton, Springvale and a small neighbourhood group of shops at Westall.

The Westall UFO sighting was recorded 6 April 1966, and took place in the area.

==Transport==

Westall Road runs north to south through Westall. There is a large bridge over the railway line. Several bus routes pass through the suburb and drop passengers off at the shops near the Westall railway station.

Bus routes also run through the area including: 
* 704 - Oakleigh Station - Westall Station via Clayton. From 17 May 2020
* 705 - Mordialloc - Springvale via Braeside, Clayton South
* 821 - Southland - Clayton via Heatherton
* 824 - Moorabbin - Keysborough via Clayton, Westall

==Schools==
* Clayton South Primary School
* St Andrew&#x27;s Primary School
* Westall Primary School (Recently Upgraded)
* Westall Secondary College (In 2016 it was a VCE Top Performer in Further Maths) 
* Heatherton Christian College (Clarinda)

==Industry==

Substantial industrial facilities are located within the Clayton South Area, including the Clayton Business Park, McCormick Foods Australia, Goodman Fielder and Viridian Glass.

==Sports and Recreation==

Various sports and recreation facilities are available:
* Badminton, snooker, pool and table tennis facilities are available to the public at Pro Fit Badminton located at 86-102 Whiteside Rd.
* Golfers play at the course of the Spring Valley Golf Club on Heatherton Road.
* The Westall Social Tennis Club offers courts for use.
* The largest pistol shooting club in Victoria, the Oakleigh Pistol Club, is located in the Deals Road Reserve west of the Spring Valley Golf Club, in between the neighbouring Oakleigh Go-Kart Motor Track and the Oakleigh Motorcycle Club.
* Other major features of the area also include Namatjira Park, The Grange Reserve, Heatherton Park and Keeley Park.
* Nearby is the Clayton Bowls Club

<doc id="796956" wikidata="Q959030" url="?curid=796956" title="Lockheed A-12">
<text>The Lockheed A-12 is a retired high-altitude, Mach 3+ reconnaissance aircraft built for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works, based on the designs of Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson. The aircraft was designated A-12, the twelfth in a series of internal design efforts for &quot;Archangel&quot;, the aircraft&#x27;s internal code name. In 1959, it was selected over Convair&#x27;s FISH and Kingfish designs as the winner of Project GUSTO, and was developed and operated under Project Oxcart.

The CIA&#x27;s representatives initially favored Convair&#x27;s design for its smaller radar cross-section, but the A-12&#x27;s specifications were slightly better and its projected cost was much lower. The companies&#x27; respective track records proved decisive. Convair&#x27;s work on the B-58 had been plagued with delays and cost overruns, whereas Lockheed had produced the U-2 on time and under budget. In addition, Lockheed had experience running a &quot;black&quot; project.

The A-12 was produced from 1962 to 1964 and flew from 1963 to 1968. It was the precursor to the twin-seat U.S. Air Force YF-12 prototype interceptor, M-21 launcher for the D-21 drone, and the SR-71 Blackbird, a slightly longer variant able to carry a heavier fuel and camera load. The A-12 began flying missions in 1967 and its final mission was in May 1968; the program and aircraft were retired in June. The program was officially revealed in the mid-1990s.

A CIA officer later wrote, &quot;Oxcart was selected from a random list of codenames to designate this R&amp;D and all later work on the A-12. The aircraft itself came to be called that as well.&quot; The crews named the A-12 the &quot;Cygnus&quot;, suggested by pilot Jack Weeks to follow the Lockheed practice of naming aircraft after celestial bodies.

==Design and development==
With the failure of the CIA&#x27;s Project Rainbow to reduce the radar cross-section (RCS) of the U-2, preliminary work began inside Lockheed in late 1957 to develop a follow-on aircraft to overfly the Soviet Union. Designer Kelly Johnson said, &quot;In April 1958 I recall having long discussions with [CIA Deputy Director for Plans] Richard M. Bissell Jr. over the subject of whether there should be a follow-on to the U-2 aircraft. We agreed ... that there should be one more round before satellites would make aircraft reconnaissance obsolete for covert reconnaissance.&quot;

Under Project Gusto the designs were nicknamed &quot;Archangel&quot;, after the U-2 program, which had been known as &quot;Angel&quot;. As the aircraft designs evolved and configuration changes occurred, the internal Lockheed designation changed from Archangel-1 to Archangel-2, and so on. These names for the evolving designs soon simply became known as &quot;A-1&quot;, &quot;A-2&quot;, etc. The CIA program to develop the follow-on aircraft to the U-2 was code-named &quot;Oxcart&quot;. A-4 through A-6 concepts applied blended wing/fuselage configurations with combinations of turbojet, ramjet, and rocket propellant. However, these concepts never met the required range. Concepts A-7 thru A-9 used a single J58 afterburning turbojet plus two Marquardt XPJ-59 ramjets burning JP-150 fuel.
Design concept A-10 featured two General Electric J93-3 turbojets with 2-D underwing inlets and had better mission radius than concepts A-4 thru A-9. These designs had reached the A-11 stage when the program was reviewed. The A-11 was competing against a Convair proposal called Kingfish, of roughly similar performance. However, the Kingfish included a number of features that greatly reduced its RCS, which was seen as favorable to the board. Lockheed responded with a simple update of the A-11, adding twin canted fins instead of a single right-angle one, and adding a number of areas of non-metallic materials. This became the initial A-12 design. On 26 January 1960, the Central Intelligence Agency officially ordered 12 A-12 aircraft with the contract signed on February 11, 1960. Lockheed charged $96.6 million for design, manufacture and testing of 12 aircraft.

===New materials and production techniques===
Because the A-12 was well ahead of its time, many new technologies had to be invented specifically for the Oxcart project with some remaining in use to present day. One of the biggest problems engineers faced at the time was working with titanium.

In his book &quot;Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed&quot;, Ben Rich stated, &quot;Our supplier, Titanium Metals Corporation, had only limited reserves of the precious alloy, so the CIA conducted a worldwide search and using third parties and dummy companies, managed to unobtrusively purchase the base metal from one of the world&#x27;s leading exporters – the Soviet Union. The Soviets never had an inkling of how they were actually contributing to the creation of the airplane being rushed into construction to spy on their homeland.&quot; 93% of A-12&#x27;s structure was titanium.
Before the A-12, titanium was used only in high-temperature exhaust fairings and other small parts directly related to supporting, cooling, or shaping high-temperature areas on aircraft like those subject to the greatest kinetic heating from the airstream, such as wing leading edges. The A-12, however, was constructed mainly of titanium. Titanium is rigid and difficult to machine, which made it difficult to form into curves given available techniques. This made it difficult to form the leading edges of the wing and similar surfaces. The solution was found by machining only small &quot;fillets&quot; of the material with the required shape and then gluing them onto the underlying framework which was more linear. A good example is on the wing: the underlying framework of spars and stringers formed a grid, leaving triangular notches along the leading edge that were filled with fillets.

With the move to the A-12, another improvement in RCS was made by replacing the fillets with new radar-absorbing composite materials made from iron ferrite and silicon laminate, both combined with asbestos to absorb radar returns and make the aircraft more stealthy.

To further reduce the detectability of the aircraft&#x27;s afterburner plumes a special cesium additive nicknamed &quot;panther piss&quot; was added to the fuel.

===Flight testing===
After development and production at Skunk Works, in Burbank, California, the first A-12 was transferred to Groom Lake test facility (Area 51). On 26 April 1962 it was taken on its first (unofficial and unannounced) flight with Lockheed test pilot Louis Schalk at the controls. The first official flight took place on 30 April and subsequent supersonic flight on 4 May 1962, reaching speeds of Mach 1.1 at .

In 1962, the first five A-12s were initially flown with Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 engines capable of thrust each, enabling the J75-equipped A-12s to obtain speeds of approximately Mach 2.0. On 5 October 1962, with the newly developed J58 engines, an A-12 flew with one J75 engine, and one J58 engine. By early 1963, the A-12 was flying with J58 engines, and during 1963 these J58-equipped A-12s obtained speeds of Mach 3.2. 

In 1963 the program experienced its first loss when, on 24 May, &quot;Article 123&quot; piloted by Kenneth S. Collins crashed near Wendover, Utah. Collins safely ejected and was wearing a standard flight suit, avoiding unwanted questions from the truck driver who picked him up. He called Area 51 from a highway patrol office. The reaction to the crash illustrated the secrecy and importance of the project. The CIA called the aircraft a Republic F-105 Thunderchief in news articles and official records. Two nearby farmers were told that the aircraft was carrying atomic weapons to dissuade them from approaching the crash site; and local law enforcement and a passing family were strongly warned to keep quiet about the crash. Each was also paid in cash to do so; the project often used such cash payments to avoid outside inquiries into its operations (the project received ample funding for many objectives: contracted security guards were paid monthly with free housing on base, and chefs from Las Vegas were available 24 hours a day for steak, Maine lobster, or other requests).

In June 1964, the last A-12 was delivered to Groom Lake, from where the fleet made a total of 2,850 test flights. A total of 18 aircraft were built through the program&#x27;s production run. Of these, 13 were A-12s, three were prototype YF-12A interceptors for the U.S. Air Force (not funded under the OXCART program), and two were M-21 reconnaissance drone carriers. One of the 13 A-12s was a dedicated trainer aircraft with a second seat, located behind the pilot and raised to permit the instructor pilot to see forward. The A-12 trainer, known as &quot;Titanium Goose&quot;, retained the J75 power plants for its entire service life.

Three more A-12s were lost in later testing. On 9 July 1964, &quot;Article 133&quot; crashed while making its final approach to the runway when a pitch-control servo device froze at an altitude of and airspeed of causing it to begin a smooth steady roll to the left. Lockheed test pilot Bill Park could not overcome the roll. At about a 45-degree bank angle and altitude he ejected and was blown sideways out of the aircraft. Although he was not very high off the ground, his parachute opened and he landed safely.

On 28 December 1965, the third A-12 was lost when &quot;Article 126&quot; crashed 30 seconds after takeoff when a series of violent yawing and pitching actions was followed very rapidly with the aircraft becoming uncontrollable. Mel Vojvodich was scheduled to take aircraft number 126 on a performance check flight which included a rendezvous beacon test with a KC-135 tanker and managed to eject safely above the ground. A post-crash investigation revealed that the primary cause of the accident was a maintenance error; a flight-line electrician had mistakenly swapped the connections of the wiring harnesses linking the yaw- and pitch-rate gyroscopes of the Stability Augmentation System to the control-surface servos, meaning that control inputs commanding pitch changes counterintuitively caused the aircraft to yaw and control inputs commanding left or right yaw instead changed the aircraft&#x27;s pitch angle. The investigation criticised the electrician&#x27;s negligence, but also noted as contributory causes failures in the supervision of maintenance activity and the fact that the aircraft&#x27;s design allowed for the swapped connection in the first place.

====Walter Ray====

The first fatality of the Oxcart program occurred on 5 January 1967, when &quot;Article 125&quot; crashed, killing CIA pilot Walter Ray when the aircraft ran out of fuel while on its descent to the test site. No precise cause could be established for the loss and it was considered most probable that a fuel quantity system error led to fuel starvation and engine flameout from the base. Ray ejected successfully, but was unable to separate from the seat and was killed on impact. Urban explorers installed a small monument to Ray near the crash site in the Nevada desert.

==Operational history==
Although originally designed to succeed the U-2 overflying the Soviet Union and Cuba, the A-12 was never used for either objective. After a U-2 was shot down in May 1960, the Soviet Union was considered too dangerous to overfly except in an emergency (and overflights were no longer necessary, thanks to reconnaissance satellites) and, although crews trained for flights over Cuba, U-2s continued to be adequate there.

The Director of the CIA decided to deploy some A-12s to Asia. The first A-12 arrived at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa on 22 May 1967. With the arrival of two more aircraft on 24 May, and 27 May this unit was declared to be operational on 30 May, and it began Operation Black Shield on 31 May. Mel Vojvodich flew the first Black Shield operation, over North Vietnam, photographing surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, flying at , and at about Mach 3.1. During 1967, the A-12s carried out 22 sorties in support of the Vietnam War from Kadena Air Base. During 1968 further Black Shield operations were conducted in Vietnam. Additional sorties were carried out during the Pueblo Crisis with North Korea.

===Mission profile===
Operations and maintenance at Kadena AB began with the receipt of an alert notification. Both a primary aircraft and pilot and a back-up aircraft and pilot were selected. The aircraft were given thorough inspection and servicing, all systems were checked, and the cameras equipped. Pilots received a detailed route briefing in the early evening prior to the day of flight. On the morning of the flight a final briefing occurred, at which time the condition of the aircraft and its systems was reported, last-minute weather forecasts reviewed, and other relevant intelligence communicated, together with any amendments or changes in the flight plan. Two hours prior to take-off the primary pilot had a medical examination, got into his suit, and was taken to the aircraft. If any malfunctions developed on the primary aircraft, the back-up could execute the mission one hour later.

A typical route profile for a mission over North Vietnam included a refueling shortly after take-off, south of Okinawa, the planned photographic pass or passes, withdrawal to a second aerial refueling in the Thailand area, and return to Kadena. Its turning radius of was such, however, that on some mission profiles it might intrude into Chinese airspace during the turn.

Once landed, the camera film was removed from the aircraft, boxed, and sent by special aircraft to the processing facilities. Film from earlier missions was developed at the Eastman Kodak plant in Rochester, New York. Later an Air Force Center in Japan carried out the processing in order to place the photointelligence in the hands of American commanders in Vietnam within 24 hours of completion of a mission.

===SAM evasion over North Vietnam===
There were a number of reasons leading to the retirement of the A-12, but one major concern was the growing sophistication of Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites that it had to contend with over mission routes. In 1967, the vehicle was tracked with acquisition radar over North Vietnam, but the SAM site was unsuccessful with the Fan Song guidance radar used to home the missile to the target. On 28 October, a North Vietnamese SAM site launched a single, albeit unsuccessful, missile. Photography from this mission documented the event with photographs of missile smoke above the SAM firing site, and with pictures of the missile and of its contrail. Electronic countermeasures equipment appeared to perform well against the missile firing.

During a flight on 30 October 1967, pilot Dennis Sullivan detected radar tracking on his first pass over North Vietnam. Two sites prepared to launch missiles but neither did. During the second pass, at least six missiles were fired, each confirmed by missile vapor trails on mission photography. Looking through his rear-view periscope, Sullivan saw six missile contrails climb to about before converging on his aircraft. He noted the approach of four missiles, and although they all detonated behind him, one came within of his aircraft. Post-flight inspection revealed that a piece of metal had penetrated the lower right wing fillet area and lodged against the support structure of the wing tank. The fragment was not a warhead pellet but may have been a part of the debris from one of the missile detonations observed by the pilot.

The final Black Shield mission over North Vietnam and the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was flown on 8 March 1968. Good quality photography was obtained of Khe Sanh and the Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnamese border areas. No usable photography was obtained of North Vietnam due to adverse weather conditions. There was no indication of a hostile weapons reaction and no ECM systems were activated.

===Final missions over North Korea===
In 1968, three missions were flown over North Korea. The first mission occurred during a very tense period following seizure of the Navy intelligence ship &quot;Pueblo&quot; on 23 January. The aim was to discover whether the North Koreans were preparing any large scale hostile move following this incident and to actually find where the &quot;Pueblo&quot; was hidden. The ship was found anchored in an inlet in Wonsan Bay attended by two North Korean patrol boats and guarded by three Komar class missile boats. Chinese tracking of the flight was apparent, but no missiles were fired at the Oxcart.

The second mission on 19 February 1968, was also the first two-pass mission over North Korea. The Oxcart vehicle photographed 84 primary targets plus 89 bonus targets. Scattered clouds covered 20 percent of the area, concealing the area in which the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; was photographed on the previous mission. One new SA-2 site was identified near Wonsan.

===Retirement===
Even before the A-12 became operational, its intended purpose of replacing the U-2 in overflights of the Soviet Union had become less likely. Soviet radar systems increased their blip-to-scan ratios, which rendered the A-12 vulnerable. In any event, President Kennedy had stated publicly that the United States would not resume such missions. By 1965, moreover, the photoreconnaissance satellite programs had progressed to the point that crewed flights over the Soviet Union were unnecessary to collect strategic intelligence.

The A-12 program was ended on 28 December 1966 – even before Black Shield began in 1967 – due to budget concerns and because of the SR-71, which began to arrive at Kadena in March 1968. The twin-seat SR-71 was heavier and flew slightly lower and slower than the A-12.

Ronald L. Layton flew the 29th and final A-12 mission on 8 May 1968, over North Korea. On 4 June 1968, just weeks before the fleet&#x27;s retirement, an A-12 from Kadena, piloted by Jack Weeks, was lost over the Pacific Ocean near the Philippines while conducting a functional check flight after the replacement of one of its engines. Frank Murray made the final A-12 flight on 21 June 1968, to Palmdale, California, storage facility.

On 26 June 1968, Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor, the deputy director of Central Intelligence, presented the CIA Intelligence Star for valor to Weeks&#x27; widow and pilots Collins, Layton, Murray, Vojvodich, and Dennis B. Sullivan for participation in Black Shield.

The deployed A-12s and the eight non-deployed aircraft were placed in storage at Palmdale. All surviving aircraft remained there for nearly 20 years before being sent to museums around the U.S. On 20 January 2007, despite protests by Minnesota&#x27;s legislature and volunteers who had maintained it in display condition, the A-12 preserved in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was sent to CIA headquarters to be displayed there.

=== A-12 aircraft summary ===
===Timeline===
Major events in the development and operation of the A-12 and its successor, the SR-71, include:
* 16 August 1956: Following Soviet protests about U-2 overflights, Richard M. Bissell Jr. conducts the first meeting on reducing the radar cross section of the U-2. This evolves into Project Rainbow, a bid to prolong the aircraft&#x27;s operational life through a package of modifications. Called &quot;Trapeze&quot;, these added wires and paints impregnated with tiny iron ferrite beads and ECM systems. The modified U-2s were called &quot;Dirty Birds&quot;. Ultimately, the program failed to substantially reduce the U-2&#x27;s RCS, leading to the decision to develop a new aircraft with stealth characteristics.
* December 1957: Lockheed begins designing subsonic stealthy aircraft under what will become Project Gusto.
* 24 December 1957: First J-58 engine run.
* 21 April 1958: Kelly Johnson makes first notes on a Mach-3 aircraft, initially called the U-3, but eventually evolving into Archangel I. Kelly noted in his A-12 diary, &quot;I drew up the first Archangel proposal for a Mach 3.0 cruise airplane having a range at &quot;.
* November 1958: The Land panel provisionally selects Convair FISH (B-58-launched parasite) over Lockheed&#x27;s A-3. The A-3 was an unstaged (non-parasite) aircraft that cruised at Mach 3.2 at . The Land Panel favored Convair&#x27;s design, which had a smaller radar cross section than the A-3. On 22 December, Convair was instructed to continue FISH&#x27;s development and to plan for production. While Convair struggled with aerodynamic issues, Lockheed pursued its own efforts on high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance designs, evolving from A-4 through A-11. The first three configurations, A-4 through A-6, were smaller, self-launched aircraft with vertical surfaces hidden above the wing. The aircraft used a variety of propulsion schemes that included turbojets, ramjets, and rockets. None met the required mission radius of , leading Lockheed to conclude that maximum performance and low radar cross section were mutually exclusive. The A-10 and A-11 configurations were larger aircraft that also focused on performance at the expense of radar cross section. Lockheed submitted the more refined A-11 at the next Land Panel review.
* June 1959: The Land panel provisionally selects the A-11 over FISH, instructing both companies to re-design their aircraft. In July, the Land panel rejected both the Convair and Lockheed proposals. The Convair FISH used unproven ramjet engine technology and would be launched from a modified B-58B Hustler which was canceled in June. The susceptibility of the A-11 to radar detection was considered too great. On 20 August, both firms provided specifications for their revised proposals.

* 14 September 1959: CIA awards antiradar study, aerodynamic structural tests, and engineering designs, selecting the A-12 over rival Convair&#x27;s Kingfish. Project &quot;Oxcart&quot; established. The A-12 design, a combination of their A-7 and A-11 submissions, emphasized low radar cross section, extremely high altitude and high-speed performance. Earlier, on 3 September, Project GUSTO was concluded and Project OXCART, to build the A-12, was begun.
* 26 January 1960: The CIA formally placed an order for 12 A-12 aircraft.
* 1 May 1960: Francis Gary Powers is shot down in a U-2 over the Soviet Union. He safely ejected and was turned over to Soviet authorities. A well-publicized trial followed and he was sentenced to 10 years &quot;deprivation of liberty,&quot; serving three years in prison before being exchanged in 1962 for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Upon return he was debriefed extensively.

*26 April 1962: First flight of A-12 with Lockheed test pilot Louis Schalk at Groom Lake. The previous day, it had made an unofficial and unannounced flight, in keeping with Lockheed tradition. Schalk flew the aircraft less than two miles (three km), at an altitude of about , because of serious wobbling caused by improper hookup of some navigational controls. Instead of circling around and landing, Schalk landed in the lake bed beyond the end of the runway. The next day, the official flight took place with the landing gear down, just in case. The flight lasted about 40 minutes. The takeoff was perfect, but after the A-12 got to about it started shedding all the &quot;pie slice&quot; fillets of titanium on the left side of the aircraft and one fillet on the right. (On later aircraft, those pieces were paired with triangular inserts made of radar-absorbing composite material.) Technicians spent four days finding and reattaching the pieces. Nonetheless, the flight pleased Johnson.
* 13 June 1962: SR-71 mock-up reviewed by USAF.
* 30 July 1962: J58 engine completes pre-flight testing.
* October 1962: A-12s first flown with J58 engines
* 28 December 1962: Lockheed signs contract to build six SR-71 aircraft. Earlier in the month, on 17 December the 5th A-12 arrived at Groom Lake and the Air Force expressed an interest in obtaining reconnaissance versions of the Blackbird. Lockheed begins weapons systems development for the AF-12. Kelly Johnson obtained approval to design a Mach 3 Blackbird fighter/bomber.
* January 1963: A-12 fleet operating with J58 engines
* 24 May 1963: Loss of first A-12 (#60-6926)
* 20 July 1963: First Mach 3 flight tracked by MSQ 39 Radar on an RBS Train stationed at the Army Depot at McAlester, OK. The A-12 flew above 83,000 feet, at 2,250 MPH ground speed.
* 7 August 1963: First flight of the YF-12A with Lockheed test pilot James Eastham at Groom Lake.
* June 1964: Last production A-12 delivered to Groom Lake.
* 25 July 1964: President Johnson makes public announcement of SR-71.
* 29 October 1964: SR-71 prototype (#61-7950) delivered to Palmdale.
* 22 December 1964: First flight of the SR-71 with Lockheed test pilot Bob Gilliland at AF Plant #42. First mated flight of the MD-21 with Lockheed test pilot Bill Park at Groom Lake.
* 28 December 1966: Decision to terminate A-12 program by June 1968.
* 31 May 1967: A-12s conduct Black Shield operations out of Kadena
* 3 November 1967: A-12 and SR-71 conducted a reconnaissance fly-off, codenamed NICE GIRL. Between 20 October and 3 November 1967, A-12s and SR-71s flew three identical routes along the Mississippi River about one hour apart with their collection systems on. The results were inconclusive. The A-12&#x27;s camera had a wider swath but the SR-71 collected types of intelligence the A-12 could not of a good quality; however, some sensors would typically be removed to make room for ECM gear. There was little difference in range – the SR-71 carried more fuel – the A-12 had an altitude advantage of from over the SR-71 at the same Mach number, being a lighter aircraft. The radar cross section of both aircraft in a clean configuration was relatively low; the SR-71 in a full sensor configuration was somewhat higher due to its larger size and was appreciably larger again with the side-looking radar antenna installed. The A-12 was designed to optionally utilize one of three different types of high resolution cameras; the highest of which provided a wide continuous swath of resolution. The SR-71 had the simultaneous capability for photography and ELINT. Its imagery was one foot resolution of two separate swath wide strips positioned up to apart on either side of the aircraft.
* 26 January 1968: North Korea A-12 overflight by Jack Weeks photo-locates the captured USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; in Changjahwan Bay harbor.
* 5 February 1968: Lockheed ordered to destroy A-12, YF-12 and SR-71 tooling.
* 8 March 1968: First SR-71A (#61-7978) arrives at Kadena AB to replace A-12s.
* 21 March 1968: First SR-71 (#61-7976) operational mission flown from Kadena AB over Vietnam.
* 8 May 1968: Jack Layton flies last operational A-12 sortie, over North Korea.
* 5 June 1968: Loss of last A-12 (#60-6932) during Functional Checkout Flight (FCF) flown from Kadena, Jack W. Weeks became the second and last CIA pilot killed in the line of duty during &quot;Oxcart&quot; and is so honored in the &quot;Book of Honor&quot; at CIA Headquarters. The A-12 had a radio telemetry system called &quot;Birdwatcher&quot;, monitoring the most critical aircraft systems and transmitting data to ground monitoring stations. Following aerial refueling, the ground station was informed via &quot;Birdwatcher&quot; that the starboard engine exhaust gas temperature was in excess of , the fuel flow on that engine was less than per hour and that the aircraft was below . Several attempts to make contact were made without success. Monitoring continued until the time that the aircraft&#x27;s fuel would have been depleted. The aircraft was declared missing east of the Philippines and south of Okinawa in the South China Sea. The loss was due to an in-flight emergency. To maintain security the official news release identified the loss as an SR-71. An intense air and sea search was conducted but no wreckage of &quot;Article 129&quot; was ever recovered. It was presumed totally destroyed at sea. The &quot;Birdwatcher&quot; system provided the only clues to what happened and was the basis for the accident report. It was ascertained that a malfunction involving an engine over-temperature and low fuel flow on the starboard engine had contributed to a catastrophic failure and subsequent aircraft break-up.
* 21 June 1968: Final A-12 flight to Palmdale, California.

==Variants==

===Training variant===
The A-12 training variant (60-6927 &quot;Titanium Goose&quot;) was a two-seat model with two cockpits in tandem with the rear cockpit raised and slightly offset. In case of emergency, the variant was designed to allow the flight instructor to take control.

===YF-12A===
The YF-12 program was a limited production variant of the A-12. Lockheed convinced the U.S. Air Force that an aircraft based on the A-12 would provide a less costly alternative to the recently canceled North American Aviation XF-108, since much of the design and development work on the YF-12 had already been done and paid for. Thus, in 1960 the Air Force agreed to take the seventh to ninth slots on the A-12 production line and have them completed in the YF-12A interceptor configuration.

===M-21===

The &quot;M-21&quot;, a two-seat variant, carried and launched the Lockheed D-21, an uncrewed, faster and higher-flying reconnaissance drone. The M-21 had a pylon on its back for mounting the drone and a second cockpit for a Launch Control Operator/Officer (LCO) in the place of the A-12&#x27;s Q bay. The D-21 was autonomous; after launch, it would fly over the target, travel to a predetermined rendezvous point, eject its data package, and self-destruct. A C-130 Hercules would catch the package in midair.

The M-21 program was canceled in 1966 after a drone collided with the mother ship at launch. The crew ejected, but LCO Ray Torrick drowned when his flight suit filled with water after landing in the ocean.

The D-21 lived on in the form of a B-model launched from a pylon under the wing of the B-52 bomber. The D-21B performed operational missions over China from 1969 to 1971, but was not particularly successful.

==Accidents and incidents==
Six of the 15 A-12s were lost in accidents, with the loss of two pilots and an engineer: 
*24 May 1963: 60-6926 (Article 123) crashed near Wendover, Utah. The aircraft was flying a subsonic engine test flight when it entered a cloud, pitched up, and went out of control; the CIA pilot ejected successfully. The investigation found that cloud vapor had formed ice in the pitot tube, causing the airspeed indicator to show an erroneous reading. The aircraft pitched up sharply and entered an unrecoverable stall. The pilot was wearing a standard flight suit for this low-altitude flight, and did not look suspicious to the truck driver who recovered him or the highway patrol office where he was taken. The press was told that a Republic F-105 Thunderchief had crashed.
*9 July 1964: 60-6939 (Article 133) was lost on approach to Groom Dry Lake due to a complete hydraulic failure.
*28 December 1965: 60-6929 (Article 126) was lost on take-off from Groom Lake due to incorrect installation of the Stability Augmentation System (SAS). 
*30 July 1966: 60-6941 (Article 135), one of the two drone carriers, was lost during a test flight off the California coast. The pilot, Bill Parks, and launch control engineer Ray Torrick ejected, but Torrick drowned. Article 135 was operating 300 miles from the California coast to carry out a test launch of a D-21. The aircraft was flying at Mach 3.2+ when the crew made sure that the Marquardt engine on the D-21 had the required airflow. The drone was launched but the D-21 engine failed to start and it slammed down on the launch pylon causing the mother ship to pitch up. The pressure from the Mach-3.2 airflow &quot;ripped the fuselage forebody from the wing planform&quot;. The crew were unable to escape at this high speed but managed to eject as the forebody tumbled towards the sea. The pilot was picked up by helicopter from the sea but the LCO drowned.
*5 January 1967: 60-6928 (Article 125) was lost during a training flight. The pilot, Walter Ray, ejected but failed to separate from his seat and was killed. Due to a faulty fuel gauge, Article 125 ran out of fuel 70 miles from Groom Dry Lake. The pilot glided to a lower altitude to perform a controlled bailout but could not separate his parachute from his ejection seat. He was the first Cygnus pilot to be killed in an A-12 accident. 
*5 June 1968: 60-6932 (Article 129) was lost off the Philippines during a functional check flight. The pilot, Jack Weeks, was killed.

<text>The East Region () occupies the southeastern portion of the Republic of Cameroon. It is bordered to the east by the Central African Republic, to the south by Congo, to the north by the Adamawa Region, and to the west by the Centre and South Regions. With 109,002 km2 of territory, it is the largest region in the nation as well as the most sparsely populated. Historically, the peoples of the East have been settled in Cameroonian territory for longer than any other of the country&#x27;s many ethnic groups, the first inhabitants being the Baka (or Babinga) pygmies.

The East Region has very little industry, its main commerce consisting of logging, timber, and mining. Instead, the bulk of its inhabitants are subsistence farmers. The region is thus of little political import and is often ignored by Cameroonian politicians. This coupled with the low level of development in the province have led to its being dubbed &quot;the forgotten province&quot;.

The southwest region is the most endowed with natural resources like oil, timber and plantain plantation

==Geography==
===Land===

The soil of the East is predominantly ferrallitic, rich with iron and red in colour. The southern three quarters of the region consists of metamorphic rock such as gneiss, schist, mica, and migmatite. Starting at about the level of Bertoua and going north, however, granite becomes the dominant soil component. While the region supports an abundance of plant life, it is not particularly fertile due to leaching caused by the humid environment. Eastern dirt hardens quickly in the sun, and it is often used as a building material by poorer inhabitants.

===Drainage===

The region contains several river systems: the Nyong, which drains the central-western area, the Dja in the southwest, the Lom in the northeast, the Kadéï, which drains the northwest, the Boumba in the centre and southeast, and the Sangha and Ngoko, which drain portions of the southeast and form the border with the Central African Republic and Congo respectively. Many of these rivers have carved out valleys that surround them. The rivers of the territory have only slight gradients, and floods can occur along them during the rainy season. The Lom and Nyong rivers eventually empty into the Atlantic Ocean. All other rivers in the East form part of the Congo River basin.

===Relief===

Almost the entire territory of the East Region lies on the South Cameroon Plateau that forms the southeastern half of the country. The elevation thus varies between 500 and 1000 metres above sea level except for lower-lying plains of 200 to 500 metres in the extreme southeast centered on the Dja, Boumba, Sangha, and Ngoko Rivers. The land consists largely of monotonous, gently undulating hills known as &quot;half-oranges&quot; due to their resemblance to that fruit.

===Climate===

The East has a Type A wet equatorial climate (also known as a Guinea type climate), meaning that it experiences high temperatures (24˚ C on average) and a lack of traditional seasons. Instead, there is a long dry season from December to May, a light wet season from May to June, a short dry season from July to October, and a heavy wet season from October to November. Humidity and cloud cover are relatively high, and precipitation averages 1500–2000 mm per year except in the extreme eastern and northern portions, where it is slightly less.

===Plant and animal life===

Approximately the lower two thirds of the region is covered in rain forest, which grows progressively thicker as one travels south. The forests are composed of hardwood evergreens of species such as dibetu, ebony, iroko, mahogany, obeche, and sapelli, some of which grow to heights of 70 metres or more. There are also numerous ferns and orchids. This forest is stratified into several levels. The first is composed of straight, thick-rooted trees averaging about 40-metres tall. After this grow shorter, thinner trees with highly placed clusters of leaves. Sparse grasses and other plants make up the ground layer. In areas closer to settlements and roads, human groups have harvested the larger trees, thus exposing the forest floor to more direct sunlight and allowing thick vegetation to thrive. The upper third of the province (beginning at about the latitude of Bertoua and Batouri) is dominated by humid, wooded savanna. Trees here are sparser, but still may grow to be as tall as 20 metres.

The government of Cameroon has established four forest and game reserves in the East: the Dja Reserve (&quot;Réserve du Biosphère de Dja&quot;) in the southwest of the province and extending into the South Province, Lobéké Park (&quot;Parc National de la Lobéké&quot;), the Boumba-Bek Reserve (&quot;Réserve de Boumba-Bek&quot;) and the Nki Reserve (&quot;Réserve de Nki&quot;) in the southeast. The Pangar Djérem Reserve (&quot;Réserve Pangar Djerem&quot;) protects one of the more heavily wooded parts of the Guinean savanna in the region&#x27;s northwest and extends into the Adamawa Region.

Animal life is abundant and diverse. The forests are inhabited by numerous species of monkey, as well as some of the last populations of gorillas and chimpanzees in Cameroon. Bats and birds of various species are also common, as are various rodents. A few forest elephants still live in the region, as well. Many of these animals are currently under threat of extinction due to deforestation and the bushmeat trade.

==Demographics==

===Settlement patterns===

The East had 517,198 inhabitants in 1987, and it remains the most sparsely populated of Cameroon&#x27;s ten regions. The bulk of the territory has a population density of less than five persons/km2. This is mostly a result of the area&#x27;s thick forests, which inhibit settlement and support disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes and blackflies. These factors also make the East an unattractive target for development by both non-governmental organisations and the Cameroonian government, a fact that has only further prevented larger numbers of people from settling in the region.

The majority of the population is thus primarily situated in villages and towns along the few major roads that traverse the region. Along these routes, population density jumps to as high as 20/km2 and to 20-60/km2 on the Bertoua-Batouri corridor. The traditional Bantu dwelling is a rectangular house made of sun-dried bricks placed in a wooden frame. Raffia palm fronds are a common covering, though metal roofing has become more common.

===People===

The majority of the inhabitants of the East are members of Fulani (Fulbe) and various Bantu tribes that are collectively known as the Beti-Pahuin (Béti-Pahouin), the Fang-Beti, or simply the Fang. All of these groups speak various dialects of the Beti language. Most East Region peoples are considered Bantu in origin. The second most numerous are the various Adamawa–Ubangi tribes that inhabit much of the northern portions of the territory. Finally, the pygmies comprise another significant population.

Most eastern peoples speak their own distinctive languages, though educated individuals usually also know French. Minor languages spoken include Bomwali, Bulu, Kol, Mbonga, and Vute.

The people of the East are predominantly muslims, and Animist beliefs are also followed by much of the population, often in conjunction with Christianity. The East also has a significant percentage of Christian, particularly in the areas closer to the Adamawa Province.

====Bantu====

The speakers of Makaa–Njem languages are the largest group of Bantu peoples in the region. The Maka form the majority of this group and occupy much of the western territories on the border with the Centre Region, including the towns of Abong-Mbang, Nguelemendouka, and Doumé. The Bajwe inhabit the territory immediately south of this, centred at Messaména. The Nzime live at Mindourou and its surroundings on the road that runs south from Abong-Mbang. Further south on this road are the Njem, whose territory includes the settlements of Lomié, Zoulabot, Zwadiba, and Ngoila. The Mpo occupy most of the territory surrounding the Ndélélé-Yokadouma road and the side-roads off of it, as well as much of the border with the Congo. The Mpoman have a small enclave at Lokomo south of Yokadouma, and the Kunbabeeg live west of this Mpo-Mpoman territory. All of these groups speak distinct, but closely related, languages.

Though the capital, Bertoua, is a traditional Gbaya settlement, the region is today a melange of several tribes, including the Baki, Pori, Bajem, and Kwa. The southwestern portion of the Lom and Djerem division, just west of this, is peopled by the Eki, who have more extensive territories in the Centre Region. Small areas on the road from Doumé to Gonga belong to the Kwakum and Pori. The Kaka live to the south and the west of the Kadey River and have high centres at Batouri and Ndélélé. The Bageto have lands south of Ndélélé.

====Adamawa–Ubangi====

The Gbaya are the most populous Ubangi group in the East, and they inhabit most of the Lom and Djerem division (including Bertoua) and the northernmost third of the Kadey division along the Kadey River. They also have smaller population centres, including the village of Gari-Gombo and Djampiel. The Kuo occupy the extreme northeastern corner of the region, including Wendoka. The Gbete (Kepere) live northwest of Bertoua, including the territory from Bélabo west to Yangamo. The Bangantu people live east of the Yokadouma-Moloundou road in the region&#x27;s southeastern corner.

====Baka pygmies====
The rest of the region, that which is covered by thick forests and not serviced by roads, is inhabited by the Baka, Babaya, or Babinga pygmies. Though traditionally hunter-gatherers, in recent times, the Baka have established trade with their Bantu neighbours, exchanging wild game for crops or metal tools. This relationship is not always equal, however, and Bantu sometimes take advantage of the Baka, exploiting them for labour or ceding their territory to logging companies without compensation.

The Cameroonian government has tried to encourage the Baka to establish permanent settlements, and some pygmy villages exist in the territory. Most of the Baka remain nomadic, however, living in temporary shelters of leaves and sticks. A much greater force acting to end the Baka&#x27;s traditional lifestyle is intermarriage and assimilation into neighbouring tribes.

== Economy ==

===Agriculture===

The vast majority of the inhabitants of the region are subsistence farmers. Major crops are plantains south of Bertoua and Batouri and maize north of there. Farmers also raise many other crops in smaller quantities, including bananas, groundnuts, cocoyams, manioc, pineapples, oranges, mangoes, and yams. The dense forest and presence of the tsetse fly prohibits much cattle raising, but various livestock are raised for subsistence purposes, including pigs, sheep, goats, ducks, and chickens, as well as horses and donkeys in the extreme northeast. The Livestock Development Exploitation Organisation also runs a modern cattle ranch at Ndokayo in the province&#x27;s northeast.

Farms are mostly small-scale affairs planted in clearings in the forest. Farmers clear an area during the dry season using traditional implements such as axes and machetes. The area is then burned, with care taken to preserve fruit trees such as mangoes or plums. At the start of the wet season, spices and common vegetables are planted close to the home and tubers, such as cocoyams and manioc, are placed with plantains in larger plots farther afield. Farmyard manure is used as fertiliser. Crops are then harvested at the beginning of the next dry season.

This method of slash-and-burn agriculture allows for high yields in the short term, but quickly exhausts the soil. Farms are thus moved every two to three years, and land must remain fallow for up to ten years once it has been drained in this way. With the East&#x27;s low population density, however, this generally presents little problem.

Commercial crops also exist. Cocoa and coffee are raised for profit in the areas of Abong-Mbang, Bertoua, and Yokadouma, as well as in the heavy forests south of these areas. Tobacco is grown in the plains north of Batouri. No large-scale commercial livestock exists in the East, though cattle from the northern regions of Cameroon are herded through the province on their way to market in Yaoundé.

====Hunting and gathering====

Crop growing is often supplemented by hunting and gathering, particularly in more rural areas. In fact, among the province&#x27;s pygmies, these activities are carried out almost exclusively. While gathering of various wild plant species is primarily a female occupation, hunting is conducted by men with traditional implements such as bows and arrows, spears, blowguns, and traps. In addition, firearms are becoming much more common in modern times. Though most hunting is done on a small scale, larger-scale techniques are sometimes employed. In these bigger hunts, people set fire to areas of forest or grassland in order to flush out prey. Other hunters or dogs frighten the animals into running toward armed men who then kill them.

===Industry===

The major industry of the East is forestry. The region has vast tracts of forest, and African and European companies have exploited these heavily. Because of the rapid rate of exploitation, however, lumber companies have been forced to push further and further into Central Africa to find suitable trees. As a result, much of the logging that once took place in Cameroon has been relocated to neighbouring countries such as Congo and the Central African Republic. The massive logging vehicles still travel through the East on their way to Cameroon&#x27;s ports, and it is possible that without the logging industry, the East might never have got the little transportation network that exists there now. The East is also the home of several timber processing centres with major operations located around Bélabo, Dimako, and Mindourou.

In recent years, speculators have found deposits of gold near Bataré-Oya, cobalt near Lomié, and iron and aluminium in other areas. Companies have since moved in to exploit these resources as well. Other industries have a much smaller presence, such as a groundnut-oil mill located in Bertoua.

===Transportation===

For its vast size, the East has very little transportation infrastructure. With the exception of a few private logging roads, travel through the province is only feasible along the three main roads that cover the territory. The first of these, National Road #10, heads east from Yaoundé, passes through Ayos on the border with the Centre Province, then continues on through the towns of Abong-Mbang, Doumé, Dimako, Bertoua, and Batouri before turning south at Ndélélé near the Central African Republic border to pass through Gari-Goumbo and Yokadouma before terminating at Moloundou on the Congo border. Another major road begins in Abong-Mbang and heads south through Mindourou to Lomié. Neither of these roads is paved, causing travel conditions in most of the province to fluctuate with the seasons. The third major route through the province is a road from Bertoua to Garoua-Boulaï on the border with Central African Republic. This road was paved in 1997 with funds from the European Union. The only public transport that covers these routes is privately owned bush taxis or mini-buses run by private groups known as GICs (French acronym meaning &quot;group d&#x27;initiative commune&quot;).

The East is accessible via railroad, as well, through Camrail, the state-owned train system. The train comes from Douala and Yaoundé and passes through Bélabo in East Region before heading north to Ngaoundéré in the Adamawa Region. There is a regional airport in Bertoua that is officially part of state-owned Camair&#x27;s network, but it has been out of service since 2003. In addition, the Nyong River is navigable from Abong-Mbang to the Centre Province town of Mbalmayo during the rainy season.

===Tourism===
Due to the remoteness of the region and the difficulty of travel within it, the East sees very few tourists. The area boasts huge tracts of relatively untouched rain forest, however, and non-governmental organisations such as Ecofac and the World Wildlife Fund have in recent years endeavored to make the area a viable destination for eco-tourism. Their efforts have centered on the East&#x27;s national parks and forest reserves, particularly the Dja Reserve. In 2003, for example, CIAD and other NGOs began a gorilla habituation project to pave the way for camera-toting tourists to come within a few metres of the animals to see them in their natural environment. However, government corruption led to the cancellation of the initiative. Hunters may also pursue game through these reserves.

==Administration and social conditions==
===Government===

A presidentially appointed governor heads the administration of the province from the capital city of Bertoua.

The East is divided into four departments (&quot;departements&quot;), each headed by a presidentially appointed senior divisional officer or prefect (&quot;prefet&quot;):
# Boumba-et-Ngoko (Boumba and Ngoko) takes up the southeast and has its centre in Yokadouma.
# Haut-Nyong (Upper Nyong) occupies the southwestern portion and is centred on Abong-Mbang.
# Kadey (also spelled Kadéï or Kadei) forms the central-eastern portion of the territory and is governed from Batouri.
# Lom-et-Djérem (Lom and Djérem) consists of the north of the province and has its capital in Bertoua.

Each of these divisions is further divided into sub-divisions, each headed by a sub-divisional officer or sub-prefect (&quot;sous-prefet&quot;). Individual towns usually have a mayor, and some villages have a traditional chief, though this person usually holds little actual authority.

Cameroonian politicians have traditionally ignored the East. The region is simply too underpopulated to have much influence in countrywide elections. Eastern residents have in recent years called for more infrastructure improvements from the government, especially the paving of roads. Candidates for office and government officials do occasionally make stops in the region to address such issues, but their message is often simply an excuse for why such improvements would be detrimental to the region. For example, they often argue that paved roads would only allow the forests upon which the region depends to be cut down at an even faster rate.

===Education===

School attendance rates are difficult to determine for the East, but are generally higher in the towns than in the villages. Primary schools are fairly widely distributed, but most of the region&#x27;s secondary schools are located in larger villages or in towns, meaning that students from more remote areas must walk long distances, stay with relatives, or rent rooms during the school year. In addition, school fees keep many families from sending their children for an education.

===Health===

Due to its thick forests and equatorial climate, the East is home to a host of tropical diseases. Chief among these is malaria, which remains a major cause of death in the region. Dengue fever, filariasis, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis are also endemic. In 1997 and 1998, health professionals recorded outbreaks of what may have been the Ebola virus in the southwest near Ngoila. The World Health Organization today doubts that this &quot;bloody diarrhea&quot; was in fact that virus, however.

As with most of sub-Saharan Africa, poor sanitation is a major source of illness for people in the East. Diseases spread this way include schistosomiasis, brucellosis, hepatitis A, amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, and giardia.

In recent years, the East has come into focus for its role in the AIDS epidemic. This largely stems from the region&#x27;s position as a transportation network for logging vehicles. In addition to the transportation network, the construction of the Chad/Cameroon pipeline has fueled the increase of Prostitution along these routes, with professional sex workers operating in virtually every town and village along the province&#x27;s roads. Government estimates report the HIV rate among operators of these logging vehicles to be about 18% and that of the sex workers to be as high as 30%.

Government efforts in the 1980s to improve the number and quality of hospitals in Cameroon have made healthcare more available in the region. Most hospitals and clinics are located in the larger towns, however, meaning that the seriously ill have little chance of getting to treatment in many cases. Traditional medicine is still largely practiced in the East, as well, and many people ascribe various maladies to the workings of witches or sorcerers.

==History==
===Early population movements===

Archaeological finds around Batouri, Bertoua, and Bétaré-Oya attest to human presence in the territory of the East Province since prehistoric times. The earliest inhabitants of the region are commonly assumed to have been the Bambenga pygmies, part of the larger Twa group who may be descendants of the pygmies mentioned in Egyptian and Classical sources. The pygmies were followed by waves of migrating Bantus in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Maka stayed to occupy the territories surrounding what is now Massaména and Abong-Mbang, and the Njem settled around present-day Mindourou and Lomié. The Kaka settled in the territory that is now Ndélélé. A later wave of immigration came in the 19th century when the Beti-Pahuin pushed in from the west to escape pressures from the Babouti. This second Bantu invasion did not get far, however, as the Fang-Beti soon encountered the Maka and Njem and were unable to press on further. Of these, the Maka-Njem moved into the territory first, after being forced from their home north of the Lom River by migrating Beti-Pahuin peoples, themselves fleeing the Vute, Mbum, Gbaya, and, ultimately, the Fulani. The Maka stayed to occupy the territories surrounding what is now Massaména and Abong-Mbang, and the Njem settled around present-day Mindourou and Lomié. The Kaka settled in the territory that is now Ndélélé.

The Adama-Ubangi peoples came into the territory as part of this same general migration, though they were usually the ones pushing the Bantu peoples further south. Gbaya tradition says that they moved into the region of Bertoua under a leader named Ndiba. His son, Mbartoua, was in power when the Germans arrived.

===The coming of the Europeans===

For the five centuries or so since the Portuguese first reached the coast of present Cameroon, European explorers made little attempt to push into the intererior. The region was a source of slaves, which were shipped out via the port at Douala or via the Congo River, though the numbers of natives taken were much smaller than in areas closer to the coast.

The French were the first Europeans to enter the region when they began exploring the Congo Basin in the mid-19th century. It was the Germans, however, who first gained formal control over the area, establishing the eastern border through negotiations with France between 1885 and 1908. Ironically, the earliest German colonists to the eastern forests were largely entering unknown territory. The Germans set to work building roads and establishing plantations, both endeavors requiring forced labor by the natives. This often led to violence, such as when the Gbaya under Mbartoua led a rebellion in the Bertoua region in 1903. Another revolt occurred when the Kaka protested their loss of lucrative trade opportunities that they had enjoyed in pre-colonial days.

At the end of World War I in 1916, Germany was forced to cede its colony to France. The French divided Cameroon into nine administrative areas, and most of what is now the East Province fell into the Doumé-Loume-Yokadouma district with its capital in Doumé. The French largely continued the colonial practices of the Germans, with forced labor continuing into the early 20th century. They made further infrastructure improvements, as well, such as improving the road from Yaoundé to Bertoua and on to Garoua-Boulaï.

===Post-independence===

The boundaries of the East Province were finalised after Cameroon gained independence in 1961. The capital was moved from Doumé to Bertoua in 1972.

The region has largely been ignored since independence. One of the few developments of note include the extension of the railroad from Yaoundé to Bélabo under the presidency of Ahmadou Ahidjo.

In the first months of 2014, thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the Central African Republic arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the East Region, Adamawa Region, and North Region.

There are at least two different versions of this EP; all tracks were recorded at the Aichi Kosei Nenkin Kaikan in Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan on 23 May 1981. It was lead singer Paul Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s final recording with the band. The original Japanese pressing features only 4 tracks and the record speed is 45RPM, but the other version has 5 tracks. It was never the band&#x27;s intention to release this album, but Toshiba-EMI wanted a live album.

The EP has been officially reissued on CD twice — the four-track version was included as part of the singles box set &quot;The First Ten Years&quot;, released in 1990, while the five-track version was included on the bonus disc that came with the 1995 reissue of &quot;Killers&quot; in the US (the European release did not include the &quot;Maiden Japan&quot; tracks).

== Cover art ==
The original cover depicted the band&#x27;s mascot, Eddie, holding the severed head of singer Paul Di&#x27;Anno. The replacement cover was done on very short notice after Iron Maiden&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, received a proof for review, and became agitated at Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s depiction because the band was looking to replace him. &quot;Maiden Japan&quot; was released in Brazil (in 1981 &amp; a 1985 re-issue) &amp; Venezuela (in 1987) with the original cover and have become collector&#x27;s items.

==Accolades==
The Rolling Stone Italia named &quot;Maiden Japan&quot; EP as &quot;The most important and the best metal&#x27;s live EPs ever&quot;. Ultimate Classic Rock placed &quot;Maiden Japan&quot; on Top 40 Best 1981 Albums List. Maiden Japan EP went platinum in Canada and made it to the charts in many other countries around the world.

<text>Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer (1526–1588) was a wood merchant of Haarlem, who became a legendary folk hero for her fearless defense of the city against the Spanish invaders during the siege of Haarlem in 1573.

==Biography==

She was the daughter of the Haarlem brewer Simon Gerrits and Guerte Koen Hasselaer. When the city was besieged by the Spanish, period diarists reported that all of the townspeople, man, woman, and child, fearlessly helped to rebuild the city defenses that had been destroyed by enemy cannon. One account written in Latin from Delft, mentioned Kenau by name as an unusually fearless woman who worked night and day carrying earth to the city walls to rebuild the defense line.

This (anonymous) account mentioned in the next paragraph how the people of Haarlem stood on these earthworks and threw burning tar wreaths around the necks of the enemy, and described how one Spanish soldier jumped into the river Spaarne to douse the flames only to drown from the weight of his armor. Somehow the story arose that it was Kenau who threw these &#x27;tar wreaths&#x27;. Kenau’s role as an earth carrier was soon glorified into a full-fledged soldier who was honored at the centennial celebrations of independence from Spain in 1673 and again during the bicentenary in 1773. By the 19th century she had led an army of 300 women against the Spanish, which had even been commemorated in a romantic painting by Barent Wijnveld and J.H. Egenberger.

==Authenticity==

It was the Haarlem doctor and historian Dr. C. Ekama who first questioned the Kenau legend in 1872 on the eve of the tricentenary celebrations. He pointed out that neither she nor any other woman had been placed on the list of &#x27;war criminals&#x27; after the Spanish took control, while her 18-year-old cousin Pieter Dirksz Hasselaer, a member of the schutterij, was on the list and was arrested, though later released. However, women were generally not seen as war criminals or beheaded, and thus not mentioned as such. Additionally, women fighting to defend a city were not uncommon in that time such as during the attack of Antwerp in 1576 (Spaanse Furie) where a citizen&#x27;s army of 12,000 men and women built ramparts and fought against the Spanish.

==Archival evidence==
She married Nanning Gerbrandsz Borst around 1544. They had four children: Guerte, Margriet, Lubbrich, and Gerbrand. After the death of her husband in 1562 she continued his business. After her daughter Lubbrecht died, she took the motherless son of her brother Coen into her home, also called Guerte, like her daughter. She was the sister-in-law of Hadrianus Junius and left Haarlem soon after the siege ended. Through him she probably came into contact with the Delft brewer David Jansz, with whom she made a contract in grain trade. Through this trade she heard of a lucrative post in Arnemuiden, which she won; by resolution of 2 September 1574, she became Weighing House Master and Collector of Peat in the city of Arnemuiden. In 1577, she is mentioned in documents as an inhabitant of Leiden &quot;op de vliet&quot;. Not long after, she returned to Haarlem, where her son Gerbrand had become an independent shipbuilder. In 1579 her name appears in the shipyard lists, but she was apparently not documented as a returning hero. In fact she went to great trouble in 1585 to receive money from the Haarlem council for wood delivered during the siege that was never paid for. In 1593 some money was paid to her daughters.

She bought a ship to resume her trade as wood merchant, which made about five trips per year to Norway. The captain was taken hostage and Kenau went to great lengths to have him released, but apparently she travelled north and became the victim of pirates herself, according to her daughters. In May 1589, her daughters sued skipper Lieven Hansz from Holstein for this ship. During the trial, it was proven that she had left port for Norway in 1588 and disappeared. Lieven Hansz stated that he had bought the ship in Flensburg from the port official charged with selling deserted ships. It is therefore often assumed that she died at the hands of pirates, but other theories too exist.

==Legacy==
In 1800 the Batavian Republic named a frigate, the &quot;Kenau Haselaar&quot; after her.

Her name lives on in colloquial Dutch. Originally, it stood for female bravery, but as social role models developed, the word &quot;kenau&quot; came to stand for &quot;shrew&quot;.

In 2014 a Dutch film was released about her with Monic Hendrickx in the lead role.

<text>The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC) was a non-governmental organisation which until the end of 2007 pre-approved most British television advertising. The work of the BACC has been taken over by Clearcast.

BACC approval was applied both to scripts and to the final commercials. The BACC applied a list of criteria which included both good taste and decency criteria, and also a variety of technical and even medical constraints (advertisements may not, for example, contain flashing which would set off attacks of photosensitive epilepsy).
The BACC was a department of ITV but funded by all of the participating British commercial television channels, in proportion to their viewing figures.

All TV commercials in the UK which were broadcast as part of a national campaign (i.e. on a national channel such as Channel 4, Channel Five, Sky etc.) had to be pre-approved by the BACC.

== Clearcast ==

As of 2008 the work (and staff) of the BACC was taken over by Clearcast. Whilst the BACC had been owned and administered only by ITV, Clearcast&#x27;s shareholders include ITV, C4, Five, Sky, Turner, IDS and Viacom.

Clearcast was born out of The UK TV Administration Forum, which has representation from all major broadcasters, to develop a more effective means of managing its existing shared services within television administration. Clearcast will provide an effective one-stop resource for the administration of all audiovisual advertising.

Clearcast has also taken over management of the Attribution System from the board of TV Eye, as well as managing additional commercial and administration contracts and services going forward.

== The BACC process ==

Advertising agencies submit pre-production scripts before any significant expense is incurred in the production of a TV commercial to the BACC. Once submitted the agencies allocated Copy Group Executive will give initial comments on the script detailing broadcast timing restrictions, advice on the appropriate use of specific shots or imagery and requesting substantiation. An agency will then either adapt the script (because it does not comply or contains a claim which cannot be &#x27;backed up&#x27;) and submit relevant substantiation documents to the BACC executive.

A process of second-reading then takes place whereby the executive may request further information or approve the script.

The process of script submissions is to reduce the risk of agencies spending a significant outlay on a TV commercial which is later rejected because it is unacceptable.

Once a script submission is accepted an agency will produce a final (or &#x27;clocked&#x27;) TV commercial which also needs to be submitted for approval to the BACC. The agency can submit the &#x27;clocked&#x27; ad in a variety of ways including on VHS, DVD or digitally via FTP using the digital copy clearance system.

Once received and ingested into the BACC system the ad is first checked for supers, a process which measures the height (in television lines) of required legal text (&#x27;the small print&#x27;) to ensure it complies. The legal text height is 16 TV lines, measured on a flat-topped, lower case letter and anything less will be rejected. Legal text is also timed to ensure it is legible to the viewer.

Some ads fail at this point and the agency is forced to change the legal text to ensure it complies. After this stage the ad is subjected to a &#x27;flash test&#x27; which ensures it will not cause health implications to sufferers of photosensitive epilepsy.

After this stage the commercial is screened by a Traffic Assistant who checks the ad and accompanying post-production script and relevant consignment details are full, valid and correct. Consignment details include relevant music, artists names and voice-over names.

Once this process is complete the ad is allocated to the relevant Copy Group Executive where it is viewed and placed &#x27;on the reel&#x27; for the following day&#x27;s morning meeting. The term &#x27;on the reel&#x27; relates to a viewing which takes place every morning at 10am where a group of executives view each commercial and pass comments on whether it complies with the BCAP code. Most ads comply (because they are as per the initial script) but this viewing serves as a point of spotting otherwise unforeseen problems such as music which is not permitted or a style of cutting which does not show the product in an accurate light.

After the morning meeting, usually at 11:30am the copy group return to their desks and pass on feedback to the agencies and approve compliant commercials.

<doc id="796978" wikidata="Q2100030" url="?curid=796978" title="Pngcrush">
<text>pngcrush is a free and open-source command-line utility for optimizing PNG image files. It reduces the size of the file losslessly that is, the resulting &quot;crushed&quot; image will have the same quality as the source image.

The main purpose of pngcrush is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT data stream by trying various combinations of compression methods and delta filters. It can also be used for various manipulations of PNG images, such as changing the bit depth, removing unwanted ancillary chunks, or adding certain chunks including gAMA, tRNS, iCCP, and textual chunks.

==Main operation==
The main use of pngcrush is for reducing the size of the image data contained in the IDAT section.

The pixel data in a PNG file is compressed using LZ77 algorithm (which tries to find repeated byte sequences in the source data), and then further compressed with Huffman algorithm. This combination is referred to as deflate compression. Before compressing, non-destructive delta filters are applied on the pixel data.

There are five possible filter types that can be specified separately on each scan line and several possible strategies for searching LZ77 matches. Thus, there are a very large number of different combinations for how the image can be compressed. Which combination gives the best compression will depend on the individual image&#x27;s properties.

pngcrush compresses the image with multiple different combinations and then stores the smallest of the resulting files. Since it is not possible to go through all the combinations, pngcrush uses heuristics to choose the methods to try.

By default, pngcrush uses just a few common methods to crush the file. The optional &quot;-brute&quot; argument can be used for brute force crushing, which will try 176 different crushing methods on version 1.8.12 and later or 148 crushing methods on versions 1.7.45 through 1.8.11.

==Reducing file size by removing color-correction data==
One of pngcrush&#x27;s features is the ability to remove all the color-correction data (gamma, white balance, ICC color profile, standard RGB color profile) from PNG files.

Since most graphics software embed the extra color-correction data, which is normally not needed, removing it can produce file sizes that are up to 40% smaller than the original. pngcrush, when told, will also losslessly reduce the bit-depth of images or apply a color palette when possible if doing so results in a smaller file size. All ancillary chunks and text chunks can be removed.

==Image manipulation==
pngcrush can be used to change the color encoding of an image. For example, if an image contains 10 colors but has a color palette of 256 entries (8-bit), pngcrush can be used to reduce the color palette to a 4-bit one and truncate the palette to 10 entries.

pngcrush can also change the color type of the image. For a true-color image, changing the color type from 2 to 0 converts it to greyscale. Greyscale images are generally smaller than truecolor images because, in addition to the optional alpha channel, only one 8-bit channel is used per pixel rather than three. Greyscale images are also generally smaller than paletted images because they do not need to define a color palette. For a truecolor-alpha image, changing the color type from 6 to 2 removes the alpha channel.

==Chunk and metadata manipulation==
PNG images contain chunks with information about the image, such as its resolution (the phys chunk), the time it was last modified (the tIME chunk), and textual metadata (the text chunk and its variants). With pngcrush, a user can edit or remove those ancillary chunks.

<doc id="796981" wikidata="Q5290302" url="?curid=796981" title="Dominant ideology">
<text>In Marxist philosophy, the term dominant ideology denotes the attitudes, beliefs, values, and morals shared by the majority of the people in a given society. As a mechanism of social control, the dominant ideology frames how the majority of the population thinks about the nature of society, their place in society, and their connection to a social class.

In &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1845), Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels said that &quot;The ideas of the ruling class are, in any age, the ruling ideas&quot; applied to every social class in service to the interests of the ruling class. In revolutionary praxis, the slogan: &quot;The dominant ideology is the ideology of the dominant class&quot; summarises ideology&#x27;s function as a basis for revolution.

In a capitalist, bourgeois society, Marxist revolutionary praxis seeks to achieve the social and political circumstances that render the ruling class as politically illegitimate, as such, it is requisite for the successful deposition of the capitalist system of production. Then, the ideology of the working class achieves and establishes social, political, and economic dominance, so that the proletariat (the urban working class and the peasantry) can assume power (political and economic) as the dominant class of the society.

In non-Marxist theory, the &quot;dominant ideology&quot; means the values, beliefs, and morals shared by the social majority, which frames how most of the populace think about their society, and so, to the extent that it does, it may or may not serve the interests of the ruling class; therefore, the extent to which a dominant ideology effectively dominates collective societal thought may or may not have declined during the modern era.

==Marxism==
Social control exercised and effected by means of the ideological manipulation of aspects of the common culture of a society—religion and politics, culture and economy, etc.—to explain and justify the &quot;status quo&quot; to the political advantage of the dominant (ruling) class dates from the Age of Enlightenment, in the 18th century. Such a method of social control conceptually derived from the Noble Lie, proposed by Plato, which was required for the social stability of a republic composed of three social classes. In Book 3 (414e–15c) of &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato presents the Noble Lie (&quot;gennaion pseudos&quot;, γενναῖον ψεῦδος) in a fictional tale, wherein Socrates establishes and justifies the origin of the socially stratified society:

By the nineteenth century, Karl Marx described such ruling-class cultural hegemony with the term &quot;dominant ideology&quot;, which described the societal &quot;status quo&quot; (religious and political, economic and cultural) that characterised the capitalism of the nineteenth century. As such, Marxist philosophic theory proposes two conceptual models, the Intentional and the Spontaneous, to characterise the social function(s) of the dominant ideology:

;(i) Intentional

Ideology is deliberately constructed by bourgeois and petit-bourgeois intellectuals, which then is propagated by the mass communications media (print, radio, television, cinema, Internet). Hence, because the bourgeoisie own the communications media, as a social class, they can select, determine, and publish the economic, social, and cultural concepts that constitute the established &quot;status quo&quot;, which are the ideology (formal doctrines) that serves their interests as the ruling class of the society.

Moreover, because the working class own no mass communications media, they are overwhelmed by the bourgeoisie′s cultural hegemony, and, because they have no intellectuals of their own, they adopt the imposed bourgeois worldview (&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;), which thus constitutes a false consciousness about their own economic exploitation by the strata of the upper classes; with that false awareness the working class lose their social and political, economic and cultural independence as a social class.

;(ii) Spontaneous
Ideology spontaneously originates in every social class of a society, as an expression of the existing material structure of the given society. Based upon their experiences of societal life, the men and women of each social class (upper, middle, lower) construct their intellectual understanding of the society, and, because their societal experiences are primarily of capitalist social relations, the shared (dominant) ideology tends to reflect the norms of a capitalist society. Hence, the content of the reportage of a newspaper is determined, not by the socio-economic and political prejudices of the publisher, but by the societal &quot;status quo&quot;, the fixed social narrative that is believed by the publisher and by the readers of the newspaper.

In organising as trade unions, the working class experience and express a different type of social relation within a capitalist society, because such an ideological perspective challenges the intellectual and social legitimacy of capitalism, by questioning the validity of how society is organised, and thus how it functions. The successful establishment of a working-class ideology (worldview) represents a collective approach to perceiving and resolving the socio-economic, political, and cultural problems of working-class people. Therefore, by means of such an embryonic class consciousness, a new material structure, within a capitalist society, becomes the base of a new ideology that expresses the interests of workers—and contradicts the &quot;status quo&quot; of the bourgeois cultural hegemony proposed and established by the dominant ideology of the capitalist ruling class.

==Criticism==
In Marxist theory, one of the social classes of a society becomes the ruling class when they are a socially progressive force sufficiently powerful, with popular support of the other social classes, to overthrow the previous ruling class. For example, the great bourgeois revolutions of the 17th and 18th centuries occurred because the bourgeoisie had become the standard-bearer for social progress, the universal class. The bourgeoisie gradually began to lose its progressive character and became increasingly reactionary once it came to power (since it began to support the status quo rather than seek further social progress).

As a consequence, the dominant ideology may contain a mixture of socially progressive and regressive elements. Therefore, Marxists do not reject everything and anything related to the dominant ideology of capitalism; rather, they agree with its progressive elements and criticise its regressive elements. In other words, Marxist critiques of the dominant ideology of capitalism are not normally crude rejections of their content, but rather of their limiting, capitalist form.

<text>The Naseby was a three-decker ship of the line built for the Commonwealth of England&#x27;s Navy. She was one of four Second rates authorised by the Council of State on 3 July 1654 as part of the 1654 Construction Programme, intended to carry 60 guns each. Construction was allocated to Woolwich Dockyard, where the ship was to be designed and built by Peter Pett II. She was named &quot;Naseby&quot;, in honour of Sir Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s decisive 1645 victory over the Royalist forces during the English Civil Wars.

However, it was decided early on to alter the Programme to include a First rate &quot;suitable as a fleet flagship&quot;, and the &quot;Naseby&quot; was altered during construction to mount a complete battery of guns along the upper deck (compared with the partial battery on this deck of her intended sisters, on which there were no gunports in the waist along this deck), and so was reclassed as a First rate of 80 guns. Her length was extended by 7 ft (compared with her intended sisters), allowing room for a 14th pair of gunports on the lower deck, and also 14 pairs on the middle deck, as well as 13 pairs on the now fully-armed upper deck and 6 pairs on the quarterdeck.

On completion, she measured 131 ft on the keel and 42 ft in breadth (giving her a burthen tonnage of 1,129), but the breadth was then increased by 6in to 42 ft 6 in by girdling (adding more timbers along the sides) which increased her burthen tonnage to 1,258. She was armed with 20 cannon-of-seven (42-pounders) and 6 demi-cannon on the lower deck (compared with the all-demi-cannon main battery of her intended sisters), with 26 culverins on the middle deck and 28 demi-culverins on the higher decks; a further pair of demi-culverins was later added to bring her to 82 guns.

In the run-up to the Restoration of the monarchy in May (June, New Style) of 1660, she was anchored in The Downs off Deal, where her laurel-crowned figurehead of Oliver Cromwell (showing the Protector restriding representatives of six nations) was removed before sailing to the Dutch Republic at the head of the fleet sent to bring King Charles II back to England, captained by Sir Edward Montagu and still under her Parliamentary name. On arrival in Scheveningen she took Charles and his entourage (including Samuel Pepys) on board. On 23 May 1660 the King and his brother James, Duke of York renamed her from &quot;Naseby&quot; to HMS Royal Charles. The ship landed them at Dover on 25 May.

Under her new name, she joined the Royal Navy, which formally came into being in 1660. At 1,258 tons, &quot;Naseby&quot; was larger than the built by Phineas Pett, Peter&#x27;s father. Unlike the &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot;, which was in service from 1637 to 1697, &quot;Naseby&quot;/&quot;Royal Charles&quot; was to enjoy only twelve years in service.

As &quot;Royal Charles&quot; she took part in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1665, she fought in the Battle of Lowestoft under the command of the Lord High Admiral, James Stuart, Duke of York, her captain being Sir William Penn. During that battle she probably destroyed the Dutch flagship &quot;Eendracht&quot;. In 1666, she participated in two further actions, the Four Days Battle and the defeat of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter in the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle off the North Foreland.


In 1667, flagging English national morale was further depressed by the Raid on the Medway in which a Dutch fleet invaded the Thames and Medway rivers and on 12 June captured the uncommissioned &quot;Royal Charles&quot;, removing her with great skill to Hellevoetsluis in the United Provinces. The Dutch did not take her into naval service because it was considered that she drew too much water for general use on the Dutch coast. Instead the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; was permanently drydocked near Hellevoetsluis as a public attraction, with day trips being organised for large parties, often of foreign state guests. After vehement protests by Charles that this insulted his honour, the official visits were ended when she was auctioned for scrap in 1673. A mirror from the ship would eventually be returned to Britain in a conciliatory gesture in 2012.

The wooden carving showing the royal arms, originally placed on the ship&#x27;s transom, was, however, preserved. After remaining at Hellevoetsluis for a while, it was brought to a naval shipbuilding yard in Rotterdam in the nineteenth century, and in 1855 was transferred to the Dutch navy&#x27;s model collection. It is now on display in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which took most of the naval collection in the 1880s.

<text>The head–body pattern is a common XML design pattern, used for example in the SOAP protocol. This pattern is useful when a message, or parcel of data, requires considerable metadata. While mixing the meta-data with the data could be done it makes the whole confusing. In this pattern the meta-data or meta-information are structured as the header, sometimes known as the envelope. The ordinary data or information are structured as the body, sometimes known as the payload. XML is employed for both head and body (see also XML Protocol).

The pattern can be illustrated as:
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;!--metadata--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;!--main content--&gt;
