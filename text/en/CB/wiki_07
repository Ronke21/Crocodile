<text>Berry College is a private university in the Mount Berry community adjacent to Rome, Georgia. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Berry College was founded on values based on Christian principles in 1902 by Martha Berry.

==History==

In 1902, Martha Berry, daughter of a prominent local business owner, founded the Boys Industrial School on 83 acres of land inherited from her father. In exchange for an education, students of the school would work to help build, run, and maintain the new school. In 1904, it became the first approved school of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In 1909, the Martha Berry School for Girls was added, and collectively with the boys school, it came to be known as the Berry Schools. The free labor provided by the students helped to keep construction and operating costs for the schools low. In 1926, the school became a junior college and several years later, a senior college, graduating its first class in 1932. During the 1930s, the school campus grew to 30,000 acres, helped by a large donation from Henry Ford. In 1957, Berry College became accredited by the SACS. During the 1960s, Berry College began paying student workers instead of crediting accounts and ended mandatory religious services for students.

==Campus==


Berry College is situated near the city of Rome in northwestern Georgia, northwest of Atlanta, Georgia and south of Chattanooga, Tennessee. The campus consists of more than 27,000 acres of land - including fields, forests, and Lavender Mountain - making it the largest contiguous college campus in the world. Designated portions are open to the public for hiking, cycling, horseback riding, and other outdoor activities. The campus is also home to a large population of deer (estimates range between 1,500 and 2,500).

The Georgia Department of Natural Resources oversees about 16,000 acres of the campus, conducts managed hunts, and provides recreational opportunities. The land encompassing the academic buildings and other public spaces is a wildlife refuge in which no hunting is allowed. In September 2011, &quot;Travel+Leisure&quot; ranked Berry among the most beautiful college campuses in the United States, noting its numerous fountains and pools among its English Gothic-style buildings.

==Academics==
Berry College offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science, Master of Business Administration, Master of Education, and Education Specialist degrees from the four schools making up its academic program. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The student-faculty ratio at Berry College is 11:1, and the school has 58.9% of its classes with fewer than 20 students, and 99.6% of its classes with fewer than 50 students. The average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student satisfaction, is 83%. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2021 Best Colleges ranks Berry College #4 in Regional Universities South, #3 in Best Undergraduate Teaching, and #1 in Best Value Schools.

===Undergraduate programs===
Berry offers degrees in the following schools:
* Campbell School of Business
* Charter School of Education and Human Sciences
* Evans School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences
* School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences

A minor degree can be obtained in 36 different courses of study throughout the four schools. Berry also offers an undergraduate degree in interdisciplinary studies.

===Honors Program===

Berry&#x27;s Honors Program is an undergraduate program designed to give qualified students a chance to learn in an intellectually challenging environment with their peers and professors. The Honors Program allows the students to take Honors-only classes, Honorized classes, and to study abroad in Honors-only programs. During their last year at Berry, Honors students must complete and defend a senior thesis. Upon graduation, they receive an Honors diploma.

===Graduate programs===

Berry offers a Master of Arts in Teaching program and an Education Specialist certification in the Charter School of Education and Human Sciences that is accredited by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCATE).

The Campbell School of Business offers a Master of Business Administration program that is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

=== Admissions ===
In 2021, Berry College accepted 77% of all applicants. Admitted students have an average GPA of 3.7, a mean ACT score of 27 and a mean SAT score of 1175.

=== Tuition ===
Berry College&#x27;s tuition is $38,430 a year, before any financial aid, grants, or scholarships. In 2021, tuition increased 1.9%, from $37,720 in 2020 to the current rate of $38,430. On average, college tuition rises about 3 percent a year.

Berry College has the same tuition for Georgia residents as for students from other states and international students.

In addition to tuition, students at Berry can expect to pay around $13,620 a year for room and board, which covers the cost of on-campus housing and a meal plan. Students who live off campus but still want to eat on campus can pay $6,180 a year for a meal plan.

===Berry College Elementary and Middle School===
Berry College Elementary and Middle School is a private school located on Berry College&#x27;s mountain campus across from Frost Chapel. Established in 1977, the school was initially called the Berry College Academy - which held a variety of students from preschool to high school. The academy was meant to follow British enfant school practices. Using a Lilly Foundation Grant, the school was called the Early Learning Center in the Westcott Building and taught kindergarten and first grade students. Furthermore, the high school students were engaged in Bible study.

Berry abruptly closed the academy in 1983, and all 144 students left to attend school elsewhere. In 1988, the school moved locations from the Westcott Building to Hamrick Hall, where it is now located. By this time the age range had expanded to teach children up until fifth grade. Since 2002, it has enrolled students in up to the eighth grade. A year later, the older students were moved from Hamrick Hall to the newly built Cook Building on Main Campus to form their own separate middle school. A series of reunion events were held for former students, parents, teachers and directors in 2007 for the thirty year anniversary. The names of the schools were merged into one, Berry College Elementary and Middle School.

In 2015, the school was home to 129 elementary and middle school students with a 1:12 teacher to student ratio. During the 180 days in the school year, the students attend class for seven hours compared to the normal six for other elementary schools in the area. The Middle Schoolers were also known for annually producing short films, with the eight graders receiving a &quot;Martha&quot; award for their achievements.

==Student life==
Berry College has a total of 1,943 undergraduate students for the 2019–2020 academic year. There are 91 graduate students. There is a 66:34 female to male ratio, and 69 percent of the students are in-state residents. Students come from 35 states and at least 18 foreign countries.

===Outdoor recreation===
Berry College has more than 80 miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails, and two disc golf courses; all are open to the Berry community and to the public. The Victory Lake Campground located in the heart of Berry&#x27;s campus is available to Berry student use only. Berry offers an intramural program with men, women and co-educational play for many sports.

===LifeWorks program===
Berry College&#x27;s student work program, called LifeWorks, guarantees every student a job on campus for those interested in participating. The work program is based upon the original idea the school was formed around. The founder, Martha Berry, would educate local children for free if they would work around campus. This continues to help offset the tuition cost to this day.

===Film and television===
Berry College has been used as a site for the filming of several movies, in addition to music videos by bands such as Casting Crowns. The most notable films are &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; and &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Harmony&quot; (1991) was filmed almost entirely on campus at buildings such as Oak Hill, Frost Chapel, the Old Mill, and the Ford Buildings. A short scene from &quot;Dutch&quot; was filmed on the Berry campus. In addition, scenes for the Fox series, &quot;The Following,&quot; starring Kevin Bacon, were filmed here. In the &quot;Constantine&quot; television series, the Ford Buildings and the Old Mill were used as the settings for Ravenscar Asylum and John Constantine&#x27;s hideout, respectively. The Netflix Original &quot;Stranger Things&quot; filmed parts of its fourth season at the Ford Complex.

===Religious life===
Berry College&#x27;s mission statement espouses &quot;values based on Christian principles&quot;. The institution&#x27;s board of trustees chose to shutter the middle and high school academy, and used that campus property to court leadership of Chick Fil-A, a Christian-run business, through its WinShape foundation programs. The campus has a chaplain, four chapels, and an active religion-in-life program supporting all Christian denominations and religions outside of Christianity. The school recognizes the Student Association for an Inter-Religious Community, which is a student organization that encourages dialogue between religions represented on campus.

===Campus housing===
Berry College has housing for employees.

Faculty housing on the Berry College property is zoned to Floyd County School District for public school (for dependents of college employees living on the property). The zoned secondary schools for Berry College&#x27;s housing are Armuchee Middle School and Armuchee High School.

==Athletics==

The Berry athletic teams are called the Vikings. The institution is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Southern Athletic Association (SAA) as a founding member since the 2012–13 academic year. The Vikings previously competed as an NCAA D-III Independent from 2010–11 to 2011–12; and in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2004–05 to 2009–10. The school&#x27;s mascot is the Viking.

Berry competes in 22 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, equestrian, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Championships===
Berry has won three NAIA national championships in women&#x27;s soccer (1987, 1990 and 1993), one national title in women&#x27;s basketball (1976), one NAIA national crown in men&#x27;s golf (1998), and three IHSA national championships in equestrian (2011, 2015, 2016). In addition, Berry student-athletes Michelle Abernathy (marathon, 1999), Caio Soares (3,000 meter race-walk, 2004), Michelle Tuggle (high jump, 1984) and Nicole Wildes (women&#x27;s golf, 2004) have all won individual national championships. The Berry College women&#x27;s basketball team won the AIAW Small College National Championship in 1976.

In 2018, Elijah Hirsh in men&#x27;s basketball broke the single-game record for blocks in Berry&#x27;s NCAA DIII era with 10 blocks. In 2019, he averaged 9.2 rebounds (leading the SAA) and was named SAA Player of the Year, SAA All-First Team, and National Association of Basketball Coaches All-District South First Team.

===Addition of football===
The Berry College Board of Trustees voted to add football beginning in the fall of 2013, with a track and field athletic program to be added soon after. Due to the financial expense and the traditions of the school, the decision to add football was controversial and met with opposition from a significant portion of the student body, faculty, and alumni. According to the school newspaper, &quot;The Campus Carrier,&quot; adding football would not affect issues related to equal sports opportunity under the Title IX regulations.

===Facilities===
A new stadium, known as &quot;Valhalla&quot;, has been built on Berry&#x27;s campus. The facility is used by the institution&#x27;s football, track, and lacrosse programs.

The stadium was originally intended to be built near the Cage Center, but in 2012 a pair of bald eagles established their nest near the site. They returned and successfully raised chicks in 2013 and 2014. The school moved the stadium site to a new location well removed from the eagles, which have become a symbol of the school. Groundbreaking was held on October 17, 2014, and the stadium was completed for the 2015 football season.

The Cage Center is Berry&#x27;s 131,000-square-foot athletic facility that houses a performance gymnasium, a natatorium with observation seating, a fitness center, racquetball courts, an indoor track and classrooms. The Cage was named after Berry College alumnus and trustee Steven Cage, whose $10 million donation kicked off the project.

<text>Dovercourt is a seaside town and former civil parish, now in the parish of Harwich, in the Tendring district, in the county of Essex, England. 
It is older than its smaller but better-known neighbour, the port of Harwich. The name is common Brittonic with &quot;Dover&quot; coming from &quot;dwfr&quot;, which is &quot;water&quot; in modern Welsh; the origin of &quot;court&quot; is unknown but possibly meant &quot;land cut off by&quot;. The first mention of the town, as Douorcortae, is in CE1000. Dovercourt appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. Today Harwich and Dovercourt are contiguous towns. In 1921 the parish had a population of 7,695. 

Dovercourt is a seaside resort which offers shops and cafes for visitors and residents. The main shopping area is the High Street, with shops from independents to the national chains. The town is served by Dovercourt railway station.

==History==
The Saxon lord Wulwin/Ulwin was lord in 1066; by 1086 the estate was in possession of Aubrey de Vere I and remained part of the barony of his descendants the Earls of Oxford until the 16th century. It formed part of the dowry of Juliana de Vere when she married Hugh Bigod in the mid-12th century, and the sub-tenancy passed to the Bigod earls of Norfolk who held it as one knight&#x27;s fee of the Veres. Countess Juliana&#x27;s son Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk founded a chapel at Harwich and granted it to Colne Priory, Essex, a Vere foundation.

The present town dates back to 1845 when John Bagshaw, an East India merchant, moved to the area and bought the land where Dovercourt now stands. He developed plans to develop a new resort overlooking the sea with the help of W.H. Lindsey, a London architect. He started the project in 1845 by building a mansion, Cliff House, for himself and his family and actively promoted the railway link to the Harwich area. When a chalybeate spring was discovered in the grounds of Cliff House, Bagshaw extended the property to incorporate a spa, library, pump room, and conservatory. He next developed Orwell Terrace where his son Robert John Bagshaw, like his father an MP for Harwich, moved into Banksea House in 1857. However the development project, which included Marine Parade and the Cliff Estate, caused Bagshaw financial difficulties and he was declared bankrupt in 1859. Although Cliffe House was demolished in 1909 and the Spa in 1920, most of his other developments still stand.

On 1 October 1925 the parish was abolished and merged with Harwich St Nicholas to form Harwich.

In 1939 Warner&#x27;s Holiday Camp, in Low Road, was used for refugee children arriving in the UK in the Kindertransport mission. This was carried out under the direction of Anna Essinger and aided by several of the staff from Bunce Court School, In the 1980s Warner&#x27;s was used as the set for the filming of BBC sitcom &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;. The site, with the original 1930s chalets, was transformed into Maplin’s. It is now a housing estate known as Hightrees.

===The Dovercourt shrine===

In the 1400s All Saints Church in Main Road drew thousands of pilgrims after the wooden cross (or rood) on its rood screen became a shrine. &quot;It acquired a miraculous reputation and was said to have spoken on some occasions,&quot; said John Ashdown-Hill, the historian. The 1600 version of the play &quot;Grim, the Collier of Croydon&quot; says: &quot;And now the rood of Dovercourt did speak, Confirming his opinions to true.&quot; 

The accounts of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, show that he donated money to the shrine &quot;including clothing in 1482 used to dress the image of Christ on the rood&quot;, according to Ashdown-Hill.

The 1981 edition of &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable&quot; says that John Foxe reported that the crowd in the church was so great &quot;no man could shut the door&quot;. It adds that the word &quot;Dovercourt&quot; can mean &quot;a confused gabble, a babel [sic]&quot;. 

In 1532 four young Protestants from Dedham, Essex and East Bergholt rode to Dovercourt. According to Foxe, they were intrigued by the rood&#x27;s miraculous reputation and wanted to see whether it could defend itself. They took down the rood and burnt it. Three of the men were caught and hanged. The site of the burning is commemorated by the road name Holyrood on a nearby 1960s housing estate.

===Dovercourt women===
&quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable&quot; notes that the females of Dovercourt had a reputation for being &quot;scolds and chattering women&quot;. This is possibly connected with the Dovercourt shrine, above. The book cites Lines in the Belfry of St Peter&#x27;s, Shaftesbury, as saying: &quot;When bells ring round and their order be, They do denote how neighbours should agree; But when they claim, the harsh sound spoils the sport, And &#x27;tis like women keeping Dovercourt.&quot;

===Lighthouses===
In 1863 Trinity House erected a pair of cast iron screw-pile lighthouses on the beach, used until 1917 to guide ships around Landguard Point. They served as leading lights and functioned in conjunction with a third lighthouse (a sector light established in 1861) on Landguard Point itself: from seaward the two Dovercourt lights aligned indicated the initial course of approach; vessels would keep to this course until the colour of the Landguard light was seen to change from red to white, whereupon the vessel would take a northerly course into Harwich Haven. When first built the Dovercourt lights used oil lamps and reflectors, and both displayed a fixed (i.e. steady) light. In 1878 the High Light was improved with the installation of a prismatic lens assembly, and in the early 1900s it was given a flashing characteristic following the introduction of gas, in place of oil, as the illuminant for both lights. 

In 1917 Harwich Harbour Board took over responsibility for navigation marks in the vicinity and chose to mark the deep-water channel with a series of lighted buoys, rendering the lighthouses redundant. The lights were discontinued, but the structures left &quot;in situ&quot;. In 1975 both lighthouses were designated as a scheduled monument, together with the stone causeway which runs between them. They were restored in the 1980s; however, following a detailed survey they were placed on Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk Register in 2019.

<text>Thambiluvil () is a coastal village situated in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. It is south of Batticaloa, on the east coast of the island. Thambiluvil is known for its preservation of the Tamil culture, especially the traditions of the ancient Mattakkalappu Desam. It is also known for Periya Kalappu, an area that has a lagoon and rice paddys.

==Etymology==
Medieval Tamil sources, compiled in &quot;Mattakkalappu Purva Sarithiram&quot;, claim that &quot;Megavarnan&quot;, the son of Chola princess Thampathi nallāḷ and Kalinga prince Puvaṉēka kayavāku, renovated the Thirukkovil Temple and constructed a memorial tank in the name of his mother, Tampativil ( Pond of Tampati). It is believed that &quot;Tampativil&quot; later became &quot;Tambiluvil&quot;.

Another theory suggests that &quot;Thambiluvil&quot; is derived from the words &quot;Thambal&quot; and &quot;Vil&quot; (Tamile: தம்பல் + வில்), which means &quot;sludge puddle; pond&quot;. Oral reports from residents suggest that the original Thambiluvil villages spread north to Kolavil and south to Thandiyady and included a vast water source used for paddy cultivation near Koraikkalappu, a suburb of Thambiluvil.

==Background==

Thambiluvil village covers an area of , and has a population of 8,937 inhabitants, including 2,686 families. About 99.55% of the population are followers of Hindu Saivism, with a small Christian minority. The village is bordered by Thirukkovil village to the south and Thampaddai village to the north. The main industries are agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing.

Thambiluvil, along with its southern sister village, Thirukkovil, were significant in the history of Eastern Tamils. The villages were part of &quot;Mattakkalappu Desam&quot; (lit. Batticaloa Country, corresponding to present day Batticaloa and Ampara Districts) until 1961 when the new Ampara District, located at the southern part of old Batticaloa District, was formed. According to oral history, Thambiluvil, Thirukkovil, and their suburbs were primitive settlements of the Nāga people, tribes of old Ceylon referred to as &quot;Nagarmunai&quot;. The administration of the Thirukkovil Sithira Velayutha Swami Temple is carried out by locals, based on the maternal clan &quot;Kuty&quot; system, which was traditionally called &quot;Pandu Paravani&quot;, although this tradition has since been abandoned. The Thambiluvil Inscription was found here and is now kept in the temple.

==Social significance==
Thambiluvil was once known for practicing Nattu Koothu and &quot;Vasanthan&quot; (a kind of Kummi), which are traditional dances of the Batticaloa Tamils. These practices disappeared under the ethnic tensions of the Sri Lankan Civil War. The cult of the Kannaki Amman, prevalent throughout Sri Lanka, has also been observed there. Some legends suggest that Thambiluvil may have originated the Kannaki cult of Sri Lanka&#x27;s east coast. The Thambiluvil Kannaki temple is highly regarded by the inhabitants of the area.

The anthropological and sociological significance of Thambiluvil, especially to Sri Lankan Tamils, has been described in the research of anthropologists including Nur Yalman, Dennis B. McGilvray, and Lester Hiatt.

<doc id="797005" wikidata="Q1162697" url="?curid=797005" title="Fender Jazzmaster">
<text>The [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Jazzmaster is an electric guitar designed as a more expensive sibling of the Fender Stratocaster. First introduced at the 1958 NAMM Convention, it was initially marketed to jazz guitarists, but found favor among surf rock guitarists in the early 1960s. Its appearance is similar to the Fender Jaguar, though it is tonally and physically different in many technical ways, including pickup design, scale length and controls.

== Development ==

The Jazzmaster&#x27;s contoured &quot;offset-waist&quot; body was designed for comfort while playing the guitar in a seated position, as many jazz and blues artists prefer to do. A full scale length, &#x27;lead&#x27; and &#x27;rhythm&#x27; circuit switching with independent volume and tone controls, a &#x27;floating tremolo&#x27; (which actually produces vibrato) with vibrato lock, and a uniquely designed bridge were other keys to the guitar&#x27;s character. The vibrato lock can be manually activated to reduce the detuning of the guitar if one string breaks. The Jazzmaster also had an extra-long vibrato arm. The bridge and vibrato construction is very different from that of the Stratocaster, and gives the Jazzmaster a different resonance and generally less sustain. The bridge sits on two fulcrum points and moves back and forth with the vibrato motion. Aftermarket versions that provided more sustain and less buzz were created during the 2000s by companies such as Mastery, Staytrem, Halon and Descendant.

The body is larger than that of other Fender guitars, requiring a more spacious guitar case. The Jazzmaster has unique wide, white &#x27;soapbar&#x27; pickups that are unlike any other single coil guitar pickup. Although they closely resemble Gibson&#x27;s P-90 pickups, they are constructed differently; the P-90 has its magnets placed underneath its coil, whereas the pole pieces of the Jazzmaster pickup are magnets themselves. Also, the JM coil is wound flat and wide, even more so than that of the P-90. This is in contrast to Fender&#x27;s usual tall and thin coils. This &#x27;pancake winding&#x27; gives them a warmer thicker tone without losing their single coil clarity. Additionally, due to the pickups being reverse-wound, the pickups provide a &#x27;hum cancelling&#x27; effect in the middle pickup position. This position eliminates the typical mains hum that is inherent in most single-coil pickups. The Jazzmaster has a mellower, &#x27;jazzier&#x27; tone than the Stratocaster, although it was not widely embraced by jazz musicians. Instead, rock guitarists adopted it for surf rock. The Ventures, The Surfaris, and The Fireballs were prominent Jazzmaster users.

One of the Jazzmaster&#x27;s notable features is the pickup circuit featuring unusual &quot;roller&quot; thumbwheel controls and a slide switch at the upper neck end of the pickguard. The slide switch selects between two different pickup circuits, the &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; circuits. When the switch is in the lead position, the guitar&#x27;s tone is controlled by the conventional tone and volume knobs and the pickup selector switch. When it is in the rhythm position, it selects the neck pickup only with the brightness rolled off slightly due to different values of the potentiometers (500kΩ vs 1MΩ in the lead circuit), and the volume and tone are controlled by the two thumbwheels; the other controls are bypassed. The intention was that this circuit would allow the performer to quickly switch to a &quot;preset&quot; volume and tone setting for rhythm playing. The lead circuit potentiometer values also stray from Fender&#x27;s usual specifications. Up until the introduction of the Jazzmaster, Fender used 250kΩ potentiometers on their guitars. The Jazzmaster&#x27;s lead circuit uses 1MΩ potentiometers instead, contributing to its unique tonal characteristics. As a concession to its more conservative audience, the Jazzmaster was the first Fender guitar carrying a rosewood fingerboard instead of maple. The fingerboard had &quot;clay dot&quot; position inlays and was glued onto the maple neck.

Some early pre-production/prototype examples came with a one-piece maple neck, others with an ebony fingerboard, or a black painted aluminum pickguard. Longtime Fender associate George Fullerton owned a 1957 Fiesta Red pre-production body coupled with an unusual and experimental fretboard manufactured in 1961 using vulcanised rubber — reportedly one of two ever made.
Rosewood became a standard fretboard material on other Fender models around 1959. The walnut &#x27;skunk stripe&#x27; which covers the truss-rod channel on the back of one-piece necks, is absent where the truss-rod was installed from the top, and the rosewood fretboard glued on afterwards.

=== CBS era ===
As with many other Fender models, there are significant differences between pre-CBS models and models made after the CBS acquisition of Fender. The changes implemented by CBS after their purchase of Fender were largely universal, and the Jazzmaster was no exception.

From 1968 until the model was discontinued in 1980, it remained largely unchanged.

=== Discontinuation and resurgence ===
After years of dwindling sales, with instruments being pieced together from leftover factory stock, the Jazzmaster was officially discontinued in September 1980, but has since then been re-released in many forms and modifications. The Jazzmaster was re-introduced in 1986 as a 1962 reissue model from Fender&#x27;s Japanese factory, with a 1966 model existing parallel to it (with block inlays and binding, but paired with a small pre-CBS headstock). The American Vintage Reissue Series version was introduced in 1999, also based on the 1962 model. In 2007 Fender released a &#x27;thin skin&#x27; Jazzmaster reissue with thinner vintage nitrocellulose finish. The 1962 model was discontinued in favor of a 1965 model which was equipped with a bound neck and a veneer fretboard when the American Vintage Series were revamped in 2012.

Fender revamped their Jazzmaster offerings and makes the following models. Starting at the bottom with the Squier Affinity Series, a traditional Jazzmaster with Seymour Duncan-designed wide single coil pickups, Squier Classic Vibe 60&#x27;s Jazzmaster and there is also the Mexican Classic Player series which have a vibrato-unit closer to the bridge, a reworked bridge and hot P90 pickups, the Classic Lacquer series with AV65 pickups and the traditional appointments, and the American Special, and American Professional series which both omit the rhythm-circuit, opting for a single circuit layout.

==Influence==

Fender intended the Jazzmaster to represent a solid body alternative to the hollow body archtop guitars that were then ubiquitous among jazz guitarists. As the Telecaster and Stratocaster had done in other popular musical genres, Fender hoped to initiate a revolution in jazz guitar, at the expense of competitor Gibson. While the Jazzmaster never caught on among its intended audience, they were most successful in the burgeoning Southern California-based surf music and instrumental rock scene of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Fender headquarters were located in Southern California, and Leo Fender himself actively solicited local players&#x27; input and guidance in designing the Jazzmaster&#x27;s followup, the Jaguar.

Jazzmasters, along with Jaguars and their imitators, fell out of fashion among players during the 1970s largely due to their &quot;old-fashioned&quot; appearance and sonic characteristics. The 70s rock sound meant &quot;fat&quot; humbucker tone and much sustain, so guitarists gravitated toward the Gibson Les Paul and its copies. Fender continued to offer the Jazzmaster as part of its product line until 1980.

Just as Fender discontinued the Jazzmaster, Tom Verlaine of Television and Elvis Costello started giving the guitar a cult following. Consequently, the Jazzmaster would soon be embraced by the American indie rock scene.

==Imitations and Fender reissues==

There are a wide array of budget-priced Jazzmaster imitations, particularly from the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Eko, Greco, Dillion, Univox, Epiphone, Yamaha, Framus, Teisco, Aria, Jansen, Harmony, and National are but some of the brands who released guitars in the spirit of the Jazzmaster, mainly to capitalize on the surf rock sound of the 1960s. Most of these manufacturers took inspiration from the Jazzmaster, but made significant changes to their finished product before bringing them to market. Foreign Jazzmaster inspired guitars with faithful pickup variants are rare, though examples of nearly identical tremolo systems were far more common.

It wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see modern copy variants replace the Jazzmaster&#x27;s signature bridge and tremolo setup with a Stratocaster-derived assembly. This modification is in the 1990s Japanese Squier Vista Series Jagmaster guitar. Fender has since introduced more faithful recreations of the original Jazzmaster, with genuine Jazzmaster bridge and tremolo assemblies. There are also several manufacturers of high-end Jazzmaster-styled guitars, such as Danocaster, Nash, Bilt, Rhoney and Kauer.

===American Vintage Reissue 1962 Jazzmaster===
American-made Jazzmasters were out of standard production entirely from 1980 to 1999. In 1999, Fender expanded the American Vintage Reissue (AVRI) series to include two offset models, one of which being a reissue of the 1962 Jazzmaster. The reissue was mostly true to the original 1962 Jazzmaster, featuring vintage-inspired pickups, hardware, a period-correct brown tolex case with a gold interior, and a variety of Custom Colors. The Custom Color Jazzmasters in this line did not feature matching headstocks, a feature that was a hallmark of the original Custom Color Jazzmasters in the 1960s. Originally, the model was offered in an array of Custom Colors, such as Candy Apple Red and Sherwood Green Metallic. However, by the end of the model&#x27;s production run, Fender offered only three colors: Black, Olympic White, and Three-Color Sunburst. With the exception of the discontinuation of color options, the model remained largely unchanged from its introduction in 1999 until it was discontinued in 2012.

===American Vintage Reissue Thin Skin Jazzmasters===
In the late 2000s, Fender produced limited quantities of the 1962 Jazzmaster known as Thin Skins. These were almost identical in spec to the standard AVRI Jazzmasters, with the notable exception of the finish, though some, such as those offered by Wildwood Guitars in Louisville, Colorado, offered Thin Skins with a 9.5&quot; radius in lieu of the vintage-spec 7.25&quot;. The Thin Skins were offered in a number of otherwise unavailable Custom Colors, and many of the Custom Color Thin Skins featured period-correct matching headstocks. The Thin Skins were 100% nitrocellulose, including the sealer, which was polyurethane on the normal &#x27;62 Jazzmaster. This, in addition to thinner color and clear coats, created a much thinner finish than the normal. Also offered through Wildwood was a unique model, the American Vintage Reissue Thin Skin 1959 Jazzmaster. The &#x27;59 was offered in a variety of colors, and a special version in blonde was offered featuring vintage appointments instead of the 6105 fretwire and 9.5&quot; radius fingerboard.

===American Vintage 1965 Jazzmaster===
In 2012, Fender discontinued the entirety of the American Vintage Reissue (AVRI) series, including the 1962 Jazzmaster. The line was replaced by the American Vintage (AV) series. The new series featured more accurate vintage appointments, a new flash-finish method meant to create a thinner lacquer finish, and vintage-reproduction paperwork and manuals. Some improved vintage details included neck shape, thinner cases, decals, colors, pickups, tuners, and various production techniques. The American Vintage line includes a single Jazzmaster model: the 1965 Jazzmaster. In keeping with the original 1965 models, the AV 1965 Jazzmaster includes a bound neck with larger, pearloid dot inlays, matching headstocks on custom colors, and a black G&amp;G reproduction case with black tolex and a red plush interior. 

===American Vintage Thin Skin Jazzmasters===
As with the AVRI models, Fender offers limited production Thin Skin 1965 Jazzmasters. The hardware and accessories remain the same as normal production models, though the finishes are, as with the original Thin Skins, available in additional colors. Also, as with the AVRI Thin Skins, some &#x27;65 AV Jazzmaster Thin Skins are available with the modern 9.5&quot; fingerboard radius and larger 6105 fretwire. Some dealers, such as Wildwood, also tout lighter body weights.

===Fender Custom Shop Jazzmasters===
The Fender Custom Shop also produces various Jazzmaster models, including reissues, relics, and models with modern appointments, such as flamed maple tops, humbuckers, hardtails, and modified or non-production bridges.

===Fender Japan===
Fender&#x27;s Japanese facility produces offset-waist guitars which have been sporadically available outside Japan since the late 1980s, either from Japanese dealers willing to ship overseas, or from US dealers who have imported them. Since 1996, its Squier offshoot has manufactured a budget version called the Jagmaster.

===Fender Mexico===
In May 2008, Fender introduced the Classic Player Series Jazzmaster, which was made in Mexico. Fender made changes to the original design. This included replacing the bridge with a Tune-o-matic type, giving it a 9.5&quot; fretboard radius and moving the tremolo plate around 1 cm forward towards the bridge. The tailpiece was moved forward not for cosmetic or functional reasons, but to reduce the manufacturing cost of the Jazzmaster and Jaguar guitars in the same factory. Because of the Jaguar&#x27;s shorter neck length, the tailpiece is placed relatively further forward than the Jazzmaster&#x27;s. To use the same jig, both guitars are made with the tailpiece in the same position, meaning the Jazzmaster&#x27;s tailpiece sits closer to the bridge than it does in higher-end Fender models. This move changed the visual style of the guitar slightly making it distinct from all other Jazzmasters. While altering the visual style, the relocated tailpiece imposed solutions to two of the important setup issues in the guitar, by increasing the break angle over the saddles and increasing clearance over the tailpiece&#x27;s domed screws (this is more commonly achieved by increasing bridge height with a tapered neck pocket shim, or a factory-machined angled pocket on some models). The contentious relocated tailpiece has remained in some of the Mexican Jazzmaster line ever since. Fender has also sometimes used different, specially-designed P-90-type high-output single-coil pickups on limited lines. These P-90 pickups operated with a bar magnet at the base instead of the magnetized polepieces of the original pickups.

September 2010 saw the introduction of the Mexican-made Black Top Jazzmaster HS. This guitar sports a Duncan Designed single-coil Jazzmaster neck pickup and a hot vintage alnico humbucking bridge pickup, with other distinctive touches including skirted black amp knobs, a Jazzmaster tremolo tailpiece (without locking button) and a three-way toggle switch. Other features include an alder body, maple neck with 9.5&quot;-radius rosewood fretboard, 21 medium-jumbo frets, gloss polyester finish and chrome hardware.

The Jazzmaster Standard was evolved from the Blacktop model. The Standard featured two coil-tapped Blacktop humbuckers and a Pau Ferro neck; often mistaken for Rosewood. Outside of these changes, the Standard had identical specs as the previous Blacktop model, including the relocated tailpiece. Despite numerous modernising design changes, the Standard shipped with a vintage bridge, long lambasted for its instability and frequency to buzz. 

The Player Jazzmaster replaced the Standard in 2018. While specs remained similar, the neck was extended to 22 frets, pickup rings were replaced with scratchplate mountings and the humbuckers replaced with more &#x27;vintage&#x27; voiced models. Knobs and other plastic details (excluding scratchplate) were switched from black to white.

===Fender USA===
In January 2013, Fender added the Carved Maple Top Jazzmaster HH to its premium Select series. The instrument features an alder body with a carved maple top, a pair of new Wide Range Special humbuckers controlled by a three-way switch, volume and tone (with push-pull S-1 switch), and an Adjusto-Matic bridge and tailpiece arrangement. It also features an innovative &quot;channel-bound&quot; rosewood fingerboard, in which the fingerboard itself is inlaid into the maple neck.

In 2016, Fender released a &quot;Limited Edition American Special Jazzmaster&quot; which featured stripped-back controls and a Bigsby B50 tremolo/tailpiece instead of the traditional Jazzmaster tremolo/tailpiece. It also had a different type of bridge. In January 2018 the American Performer Jazzmaster was introduced, featuring Yosemite pickups with Greasebucket tone circuit and a vintage-style Stratocaster tremolo bridge.

Fender&#x27;s 2017 &quot;American Professional Series&quot; includes a new version of the Jazzmaster which has a Deep C-shaped neck with 22 narrow-tall frets and features different controls and V-Mod pickups.

Fender&#x27;s 2020 &quot;American Ultra Series&quot; The American Ultra Jazzmaster features a unique &quot;Modern D&quot; neck profile, and the tapered neck heel allows easy access to the highest register. A 10&quot;-14&quot; compound-radius fingerboard with 21 medium-jumbo frets makes for easier soloing at the upper frets, while the Ultra Noiseless Vintage pickups and new wiring options provide a wider variety of available tones. Other features include sealed locking tuning machines, chrome hardware and bone nut 

==Signature editions==

In July 2007, Fender released the J Mascis signature Jazzmaster, in honour of the Dinosaur Jr frontman. This model is much the same as previous Jazzmaster models aside from its Adjust-o-matic bridge (the Fender equivalent of the Gibson Tune-o-matic bridge), and its unusual purple sparkle finish. It was for a time the only model of Jazzmaster in production with a matching headstock, but later certain color options of the &#x27;65 American Vintage Reissue Jazzmaster appeared with that option. After the Fender version was discontinued, Squier released a J Mascis Signature with similar specifications, in antique white with a gold anodized aluminum pickguard. In the past, a Nokie Edwards (of The Ventures) signature model was produced in Japan, without rhythm circuit.

April 2008 saw the introduction of the Elvis Costello Jazzmaster, the second signature Jazzmaster model made at the Corona facility – a faithful replication of Elvis Costello&#x27;s 1960s Jazzmaster used during his 1977 debut album, My Aim is True. This signature Jazzmaster guitar features a solid walnut-stain finished alder body and a modified tremolo bridge for Costello&#x27;s trademark &quot;spy movie&quot; sound.

In June 2009, Fender announced Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore signature Jazzmasters, in honour of the guitarists of Sonic Youth. These models were released on July 1, 2009. Both editions have a pickup switch that operates from side to side, a black headstock, and only one volume knob. The difference lies in the pickup, bridge, colour, and the relative placement of the volume knob to the jack input. Ranaldo&#x27;s instrument has a Sapphire Blue finish and features dual Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups that are re-spec&#x27;d to Ranaldo&#x27;s specifications and a Mustang bridge. Moore&#x27;s version features a Forest Green finish, a pair of Seymour Duncan Antiquity II Jazzmaster single-coil pickups and a Tune-o-matic bridge.

In October 2011, Fender introduced the Squier J Mascis signature Jazzmaster with gold anodized aluminum pickguard, featuring several custom specifications from J Mascis including slightly warmer &quot;P90&quot; sounding pickups, fast satin finished neck, and nonfloating bridge.

During the NAMM Show in January 2014, Fender debuted a Jim Root Signature Jazzmaster, based on the recommendations by the guitarist of Slipknot and formerly Stone Sour. While the guitar is a Jazzmaster by name it features none of the normal Jazzmaster accoutrements, except for the silhouette. Instead, it features high output EMG 60 and 81 humbuckers, black satin lacquered mahogany body, a single volume control with three-way pickup selector switch, a Stratocaster-style hard-tail string-through-body bridge, locking tuners, compound radius ebony fretboard, contoured neck heel and a squarer body (instead of a traditional body contours). On April 21, 2020 Fender introduced the Jim Root Jazzmaster V4, featuring a bound ebony fretboard with white rectangular block markers, satin Polar White finish and a pair of EMG Jim Root signature Daemonum open-coil active humbuckers.

During the same NAMM Show, Fender also unveiled a Troy Van Leeuwen signature Jazzmaster, in honor of the Queens Of The Stone Age guitarist. The TVL Jazzmaster is based on a late 1960s Jazzmaster, with block pearloid fretboard inlays, unique gloss Oxblood finish with matching headstock, Mustang bridge, and other late 1960s-style features including a bound rosewood fingerboard and white &quot;witch hat&quot; knobs. This model is also available in Copper Age with maple fingerboard, black block inlays and binding since August 25, 2020.

==Colors==
The vintage Jazzmasters (original series) were produced in the following colors:
* Three-Color Sunburst as standard
Some available Custom Colors (this is not an all-inclusive list):
* Black
* Blonde
* Burgundy Mist Metallic
* Candy Apple Red
* Firemist Silver
* Inca Gold
* Lake Placid Blue
* Olympic White
* Shell Pink
* Sherwood Green Metallic

Vintage Jazzmasters were available in most of the common Fender Custom Colors of the era. Fender would also occasionally paint guitars in colors owners requested that were not otherwise available as &#x27;official&#x27; Custom Colors; due to this, there are Jazzmasters in colors that deviate from Fender&#x27;s offerings from the era. Additionally, many of the Custom Color Jazzmasters have matching headstocks. Blonde and sunburst models did not feature this option.

In 1999, Fender added the Jazzmaster to the American Vintage Reissue series. The American Vintage Reissue (AVRI) 1962 Jazzmaster was produced in the following colors:
* Three-Color Sunburst
* Olympic White
* Black
* Ocean Turquoise
* Surf Green
* Ice Blue Metallic

There were also limited edition variations of the American Vintage Reissue Jazzmaster available, most notably the Thin-Skin models. These models were identical to the normal production AVRI models, with the exception of the thickness of the finish (due in part to a thinner, nitrocellulose sealer), as well as additional colors and matching headstocks (though this option was not present on all Thin Skins). Some available colors:
* Aztec Gold Metallic
* Burgundy Mist Metallic
* Fiesta Red
* Shell Pink
* Sherwood Green Metallic
* Sonic Blue

Their pickguards came in Mint Green or Brown Shell colors. Jazzmasters featured bound necks with dot inlays in 1965, with block pearloid inlays from 1966 until the end of their original run in 1977; the headstocks were also larger (&quot;CBS-style&quot;) in this era. They have featured matching headstocks (headstocks painted the same color as the body) at several points throughout the guitar&#x27;s history. Matched-headstock versions generally fetch a higher price.

In 2012, Fender replaced the AVRI line with the American Vintage (AV) series. The AVRI 1962 Jazzmaster was subsequently replaced with the AV 1965 Jazzmaster. The current American Vintage Jazzmaster comes standard in the following colors:
* Three-Color Sunburst
* Olympic White

This series has also been offered in limited quantities in some of the following colors:
* Aztec Gold
* Ice Blue Metallic

As with the AVRI &#x27;62 Jazzmaster, Thin Skin models are available, also in additional Custom Colors, including:
* Aztec Gold
* Firemist Silver
* Ocean Turquoise

Like their vintage counterparts, pickguards come in Mint Green or Brown Shell colors, depending on the color.

Colors of the signature editions:
* J. Mascis – Purple Sparkle (features a matching headstock; this applies to the Japanese model only. The Squier Mascis model is antique white with gold anodized aluminum pickguard)
* Elvis Costello – Natural Brown
* Lee Ranaldo – Transparent Sapphire Blue
* Thurston Moore – Transparent Forest Green
* Troy Van Leeuwen – Gloss Oxblood &amp; Copper Age (features a matching headstock)
* Jim Root – Polar White Satin

<text>Ozora is a village in Tolna, Hungary. It has been notable since the Middle Ages, when Pipo of Ozora built a castle at this site by permission of Sigismund of Hungary in 1416. Artúr Görgei won an important victory in this area at the Battle of Ozora during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. In recent times, it has become famous for the psychedelic Ozora Festival, which has been held annually since 2004 on an estate in Ozora near the small village Dádpuszta.

<text>Shooting Star is an American rock band from Kansas City, Missouri.

The band was formed in the late 1970s. After gaining popularity in the Kansas City area, Shooting Star became the first American group to sign with Virgin Records. They recorded their debut album in England in May and June of 1979 with producer Gus Dudgeon. The band gained national exposure when a number of songs garnered moderate airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations in the US.

Shooting Star initially consisted of Van McLain (guitars, vocals), Bill Guffey (keyboards), Steve Thomas (drums), Ron Verlin (bass), Charles Waltz (violin, keyboards, vocals) and Gary West (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards, drums).

==Early history==
Shooting Star was formed in suburban Kansas City by next-door neighbors and childhood friends Ron Verlin and Van McLain (born Van Allen McElvain on May 3, 1955, in Kansas City, Missouri; died March 2, 2018). They created a band with their brothers, Craig McLain and John Verlin, and played Beatles records in Ron&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s garage. Two years later, Van and Craig had moved to different school districts and the band split up.

Upon entering Shawnee Mission South High School, Van and Ron met up again. With the 1950s nostalgia craze of 1971 brewing, they played classic 1950s hits. After seeing Sha Na Na in the movie &quot;Woodstock&quot;, they added three dancers to the act and called the band The Shooting Stars featuring The Galaxies, the name inspired by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.

==History==
===London and New York City===

By 1974, Van began serious songwriting. The band decided to stop playing cover songs and perform their own music. Later that year, they recorded a four-song demo tape and planned a trip to London, England to shop their songs for a record deal. They left on January 6, 1975, and after three weeks of shopping their music to different record labels, they were offered a recording contract with Arista Records.

Upon signing, The Shooting Stars were given the opportunity to play a showcase performance at the legendary Marquee Club in London. The band then made their way to Morgan Studios to record their first single, &quot;Take the Money &amp; Run&quot; (shortly before the Steve Miller hit of the same name). Arista Records then released The Shooting Stars from their contract, and they returned to Kansas City.

In 1977 Van and Ron persuaded fellow musician Gary West (born Gary Hodgden) to join them as a singer and songwriting partner. Gary, with his brother Ron West, had been a member of the premier Kansas City rock band of the 1960s, The Chesmann Square. After The Chesmann dissolved in 1974, Ron West formed the band Missouri and Gary West moved with the Chesmann&#x27;s lead guitarist Jim McAllister to New York City. There they formed the group The Beckies with songwriter Michael Brown, formerly of the group The Left Banke, and former Kansas Citian Scott Trusty. The Beckies released one album on Sire Records. Upon Gary&#x27;s return to Kansas City, he and Van began songwriting in earnest. 

Steve Thomas had already joined on drums by 1976 and in 1977 Bill Guffey was added on keyboards for a new lineup of The Shooting Stars. And with the addition of Charles Waltz on violin, keyboards and vocals in May 1977, the name was eventually shortened to Shooting Star later the following year and they started recording demos in Gary&#x27;s garage, all the while playing gigs around the Midwest.

After saving enough money and putting a press kit together they tried to secure another record deal in New York City. Through connections that Gary had made while a member of The Beckies, the band booked a showcase at the punk rock club CBGB. A representative for a new New York management firm, Golden Lion Entertainment, was in the crowd that night and offered them a contract. With a management deal secured, Shooting Star returned to Kansas City to continue writing new material.

===Virgin Records===
Six months later, the band&#x27;s management arranged for them to play another showcase at the New York City club Tracks. Three record companies, Atlantic Records, Virgin Records and A&amp;M Records, made offers to sign the band. Virgin, then a small British record label, succeeded. The label was looking for a rock group to break into the US market, and Shooting Star became the first American band on their roster.

In May 1979 Shooting Star returned to London to record their eponymous debut album. The album &quot;Shooting Star&quot; was released in January 1980 and the band embarked on a national tour opening for Robin Trower and Triumph. &quot;Wild In the Streets&quot;, a B-side release, was a staple of live show encores; the song was eventually released on CD as a bonus track. &quot;You Got What I Need&quot;, from the debut, ended up peaking at #76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The debut album stalled out at #147 on the Billboard Top 200 and Van McLain explained his version as to why:

We had the number one most played AOR song in the country with &#x27;Last Chance&#x27; and our record company, Virgin, had gotten into a fight with Atlantic Records, who was their distribution. We ended up not being able to get our album in the stores for six months. We should have sold a ton of albums from having that popular of a song on the radio, but when people went to the stores, they couldn&#x27;t buy the album because it was not in the stores.
With the radio success, and Virgin switching over to Epic Records for their distribution, Shooting Star returned to the studio in 1981 to record &quot;Hang On for Your Life&quot; (July 1981). &quot;Hollywood&quot; was released as a single and climbed the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, topping out at #70. In support of the album, the band toured with ZZ Top, Cheap Trick, Todd Rundgren, Jefferson Starship and Journey. They appeared on the radio shows Rock Line, King Biscuit Flower Hour (KBFH), The Source and Westwood One.

Keyboardist Bill Guffey left the group after the recording of &quot;Hang On for Your Life&quot;.

In 1982 Shooting Star released their third album, &quot;III Wishes&quot; (July 1982), then returned to touring with such acts as REO Speedwagon, John Mellencamp, Jefferson Starship, Kansas and others.

1983 saw the release of their fourth album, &quot;Burning&quot; (June 1983) and the band once again embarked on a heavy touring schedule. But bassist Ron Verlin, who had become disenchanted with the music industry, departed in early 1984; Norm Dahlor was recruited to take over. That same year the band contributed two songs for the movie soundtrack &quot;Up the Creek&quot; (April 1984). The songs were &quot;Get Ready Boy&quot; and &quot;Take It.&quot;

Virgin Records then picked up Geffen Records as their distributor and Geffen&#x27;s A&amp;R executive, John Kalodner (who had earlier championed such hugely successful acts as Foreigner and Asia), got behind the group and they began to record their fifth album, &quot;Silent Scream&quot; (April 1985). Van, Norm and Steve were also the backing band on Ian Hunter&#x27;s single &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; The band then toured with Heart, Bryan Adams and ZZ Top.

===Separate ways===
In 1986, after almost a decade of touring and five albums, Shooting Star decided to go on hiatus. A farewell show was played on December 27, 1986 at Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas and after a few more concerts, Shooting Star went their separate ways in late spring of 1987. Guitarist McLain, in a 2013 interview with &quot;Goldmine Magazine&quot;, explained why the group disbanded:We signed with Geffen, and we put out &quot;Silent Scream&quot;. Geffen got into a fight with all the radio promo guys, and they fired them the week our album came out. We had 200 ads on the radio, out of 300 reporting stations, in the first week. [The album&#x27;s first track] &#x27;Summer Sun&#x27; was being added everywhere, and it looked like the album would be a smash. After the fight with the promo guys, it dropped to 40 stations. What do you do? We really worked hard on that record, and it was the one. It just crushed Gary when it all fell apart over something that ridiculous; It literally drove him out of the music business. You put your heart and soul into this stuff, and you expect these business guys to come through for you. We got hosed four or five times. Over the next several years fans from around the world were frustrated by not being able to find Shooting Star records, which all went out of print, while the band continued to receive radio airplay.

In 1985 and 1986 West and McLain had also been working on songs for a duo project they had in the works called West-McLain. But the interest that CBS Records had shown vanished when their connection there was fired from the company. After that West, now more disillusioned than ever, decided to leave the music business once and for all.

===Reunion===
In July 1989 V&amp;R Records, the band&#x27;s own label, acquired the rights to release &quot;The Best of Shooting Star&quot;. This release marked the first time that any Shooting Star record appeared on CD and included two previously unreleased songs, &quot;Christmas Together,&quot; a 1985 single which had been played on Kansas City radio, and &quot;Touch Me Tonight,&quot; a new song by Van which peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at #67. Enigma Records, a heavy metal label that was starting to acquire more mainstream artists, bought the rights to the album and retitled it &quot;Touch Me Tonight – The Best Of Shooting Star&quot;. In the November 4, 1989, issue of Billboard, the album was the first album to reach that magazine&#x27;s pop albums chart without being available as a vinyl record.

The band also released the first two albums on one CD called &quot;Shooting Star/Hang on for Your Life&quot;; it omitted two songs from the albums (&quot;Stranger&quot; and &quot;Sweet Elatia&quot;).

===1990s===
With the success of &quot;The Best Of&quot; in 1989, Shooting Star was offered a new recording contract with Enigma Records. Returning to the group were original members Ron Verlin, Van McLain and Steve Thomas. The other members were Dennis Laffoon on keyboards and vocalist Keith Mitchell. Charles Waltz was originally slated to rejoin but had moved to California and was busy with another band, Toledo Waltz, while Gary West had left the music business entirely. Thomas played drums on &quot;Touch Me Tonight&quot; but departed shortly afterwards as he was unable to commit to music full-time during this period. He was subsequently replaced by Rod Lincoln. In Los Angeles, the band made a video for &quot;Touch Me Tonight.&quot; It received extensive airplay on MTV, making their request chart and rose to #67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This was the highest-charting single of the band&#x27;s career. The song also appeared in the Dolph Lundgren movie &quot;I Come in Peace&quot;.

In February 1991 the band released their sixth effort, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;. During the recording of this project, Enigma Records went bankrupt and the group decided to finish it on their own, releasing it on their own V &amp; R label. After the album&#x27;s release, Ron Verlin was replaced on bass by Eric Johnson (not the famous guitarist) and the band toured with Bad English, Bryan Adams, and 38 Special. After selling about 10,000 copies of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;, the group was contacted by JRS Records (whose parent company was SCS Music), which agreed to take over distribution of the album nationally. But the group became dissatisfied with JRS, claiming they did very little to promote the album, and filed a lawsuit against them on October 14, 1992, in Johnson County, Kansas District Court.

By 1993, disappointed over the collapse of Enigma, the JRS fiasco and the general decline in popularity of classic rock music, the band went into semi-retirement but resurfaced each year to play occasional concerts with Verlin back on bass.

In 1997 the violin became a part of their sound again with the addition of violinist Terry Brock (not the same man who performed as a background vocalist with Kansas on their &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; tour).

In the summer of 1999, while vacationing in Nashville, Tennessee, Van was reunited with producer/engineer Kevin Beamish. Kevin and Van had met 20 years earlier while Shooting Star was recording its first album. At that time, Kevin was a young engineer for Gus Dudgeon. Out of this chance meeting grew the plans to record and release Shooting Star&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (July 2000). The recording took place at Sound Stage Studios in Nashville, Tennessee from December 1999 through February 2000.

===2000s===
Shooting Star celebrated its 20th year as recording artists in 2000 with the release of &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; and a fall tour. Shane Michaels joined as the band&#x27;s new violinist in May 2000, replacing Christian Howes (1999–2000), who had replaced Terry Brock. Original drummer Steve Thomas returned to the fold in late 2003 and singer Keith Mitchell left in the summer of 2005 after reported voice problems.

In July 2006 the group released the album &quot;Circles&quot; with Kevin Chalfant (ex-member of 707 and The Storm) handling the lead vocals. But since Chalfant was unable to commit to touring, he was replaced in 2007 by Ronnie Platt.

Original keyboardist Bill Guffey (born William Guffey III on July 28, 1952) died on April 12, 2007, at age 54.

Violinist Shane Michaels left the band in June 2008 to concentrate on another project, Flannigan&#x27;s Right Hook, and was replaced by Janet Jameson. Bassist Ron Verlin, who had left the group twice before (in 1984 and 1991) and had taken temporary leaves of absence since his return in 1994, departed permanently in 2009; since then, keyboardist Dennis Laffoon has also covered the position of bassist.

Shooting Star was inducted into the Kansas Music Hall Of Fame on March 7, 2009. The band performed at Liberty Hall in Lawrence, Kansas with the McLain, Thomas, Lafoon, Platt, Jameson lineup, with special guest Ron Verlin on bass, and for two songs, original vocalist Gary West. Other former members were on hand that evening but did not perform.

===2010s–present===
Ronnie Platt left the band in 2011 to work with Chicago band Arra. His final performance with Shooting Star was in September 2010, leading to a period between 2011 and 2012 where, for the first and only time in the band&#x27;s history, Van McLain was the band&#x27;s sole lead vocalist (with occasional help from the band&#x27;s violinist, Janet Jameson).

McLain spent the first part of 2012 focusing on a solo project to be released by Alligator Records before returning to Shooting Star in the second half of 2012 (this album, &quot;New Blue&quot;, was not released until 2022). Keith Mitchell returned as lead vocalist in 2012 but left again in 2013 due to health problems. Janet Jameson also left the band at this time. Topeka, Kansas native Todd Pettygrove, from the band Vandelyn Kross, then joined in June 2013 as the new lead singer, making his live debut with the group the following month at Moondance Jam in Walker, Minnesota.

Shooting Star returned to the UK in October 2013 to play &quot;Firefest&quot;, the melodic rock festival that takes place each year at Nottingham Rock City.

In July 2014 former Shooting Star vocalist Ronnie Platt joined Kansas as the replacement for departing lead vocalist Steve Walsh.

Marking 35 years since their first album, Shooting Star released &quot;Into the Night&quot; in July 2015, which was initially available as a free download at the band&#x27;s website.

During this time period, Van McLain, Dennis Laffoon and Steve Thomas, in addition to their Shooting Star duties, had also performed in the Overland Park, Kansas area as a trio – The Star Blues Band.

In September 2015 Van McLain experienced &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms that became increasingly worse. After experiencing slurred speech, he was taken to the emergency room where he began to show severe symptoms of encephalitis. He was diagnosed with West Nile fever and was hospitalized for over eight months.

On September 24, 2017 a special Shooting Star Relief Fund concert was held in Kansas City to assist McLain with his continuing recovery from West Nile fever. The concert featured members of the KC music scene including The Elders, 2nd House, members of The Rainmakers and a Shooting Star Past &amp; Present performance with Steve Thomas, Dennis Laffoon and Todd Pettygrove performing with guests Gary West, Ron Verlin, Norm Dahlor, Janet Jameson and Pettygrove&#x27;s former bandmate Chet Galloway, handpicked and standing in for Van on guitar.

Shooting Star had remained inactive since McLain&#x27;s illness began in late 2015 and, tragically, McLain died on March 2, 2018 from complications of his West Nile virus infection at age 62. Reportedly, since McLain had been receiving treatments for cancer after having survived it since the mid-90s, his immune system had been weakened and left vulnerable to the disease.

Shooting Star announced in late 2018 they would play a concert on January 19, 2019 in Kansas City with a revamped lineup to include former violin player Janet Jameson and new guitarist/vocalist Chet Galloway. According to the band&#x27;s official website, McLain&#x27;s family fully supported a reforming and continuation of Shooting Star, and the current lineup planned to announce additional shows.

<text>The Newcastle Knights are an Australian professional rugby league team based in Newcastle, New South Wales that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership. Playing in red and blue, the Knights joined the top-tier competition in 1988, 79 years after the previous Newcastle based team, the Newcastle Rebels had departed the Sydney competition with the formation of a separate league competition based in the Newcastle region.

The club has won the premiership twice (1997 and 2001) and is one of only two clubs (the other being the Wests Tigers) that has never lost a grand final in which it has participated. Notable players include: Paul Harragon, Robbie O&#x27;Davis, Danny Buderus and rugby league Immortal Andrew Johns. The team&#x27;s home ground is McDonald Jones Stadium and the club is often referred to as the &quot;Pride of the Hunter&quot;.

==History==

A Newcastle rugby league team had been assembled from players in the Newcastle Rugby League to compete in various competitions for most of the 20th century. The Newcastle Knights entered the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition in 1988 with Allan McMahon as coach. Newcastle had previously been invited to field a team in the NSWRL competition for the 1982 season but declined, worried it would weaken the area&#x27;s local league competition. The Canberra Raiders were admitted to the 1982 competition in their place.

The team was a success from the start, becoming one of the most popular clubs in its first season. By 1990, the team was strong enough to enter a play-off for fifth spot.

The club won their first competition, the Nissan Sevens, in 1991 and made the playoffs in 1992, where they were beaten by the St George Dragons. The Knights made the semi-finals again in 1995 when the competition became the Australian Rugby League (ARL), and won the reserve grade premiership the same year.

The club stayed loyal to the ARL when Rupert Murdoch started Super League in an attempt to win pay television rights to rugby league. This decision was very popular in the Newcastle and Hunter Region areas. News Limited formed the Hunter Mariners to compete with the Knights in the one and only season of Super League in Australia, but the Mariners failed to win much support in the area.

From 1997 to 2003, the Knights achieved a finals berth for seven consecutive years. The Knights won the 1997 Australian Rugby League premiership, defeating the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 22–16 in the Grand Final. The match is best remembered for its classic finish – with Darren Albert breaking a 16-all deadlock with a try just seven seconds from full-time. This win was a huge morale boost to the district following the closure of the area&#x27;s biggest employer, the BHP Newcastle Steelworks, being announced earlier the same year. Seventy per cent of the winning squad were Newcastle juniors. In this year Robbie O&#x27;Davis won the Clive Churchill Medal.

The following season, Knights players Robbie O&#x27;Davis, Wayne Richards and Adam MacDougall tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs; however, all three maintained they started use after the Knights&#x27; 1997 victory. The three were suspended, despite O&#x27;Davis&#x27; claims the club was not notified his drug was banned until after his positive test, and MacDougall&#x27;s medical reason for taking the steroids (his usage continued after he completed his suspension, now approved by the NRL). In addition, the Knights terminated Wayne Richards&#x27; contract.

In 1998, the Newcastle club finished equal on competition points with the Brisbane Broncos, but finished second on points differential (sum of points scored less points scored against). In 1999, the Knights lost their final two games of the regular season to finish 7th, before being knocked out a week later by the Parramatta Eels. The Knights came third in 2000, followed by a National Rugby League Premiership victory over the Parramatta Eels in 2001, with Andrew Johns winning the Clive Churchill Medal.

Andrew Johns won the Dally M Medal for best player in the National Rugby League twice in a row in 1998 and 1999, and won an unprecedented third Dally M Medal in 2002. In addition, Johns also won the Provan-Summons Medal (the people&#x27;s choice award for player of the year) four years in a row from 1998 to 2001, the best performance by any player in the history of the award.

The club failed to win a single match in the first half of the 2005 premiership, losing 13 consecutive matches which was the worst start to a season by any club since the 1960s. In 2006, the Knights finished the season in fourth position, a stunning reversal in form, but were eliminated from the finals after losing in the semi-final to the Brisbane Broncos, going down 50–6.
Prior to the 2006 NRL season kick-off it was announced that the club&#x27;s longest serving coach, Michael Hagan would depart the club following the 2006 season to begin a three-year contract with the Parramatta Eels. Ironically, during the week of the 2006 season-opening game against Parramatta, the Newcastle outfit confirmed Parramatta coach Brian Smith would take over coaching duties in 2007.

The 2007 NRL season was a year of turmoil for the club both on and off the field. After making a promising start to the season with victories over contenders such as the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs – the club and rugby league world was rocked by the shock retirement of Andrew Johns. The departure of their captain and most influential player had an obvious effect on the team, and although they managed to stay in touch with the top eight until the last third of the season, their season was irreparably damaged by his absence. In addition to this, the Knights endured the worst injury toll in the 2007 season fielding thirty seven players in first grade by season&#x27;s end.

The club also struggled off-field, with Brian Smith&#x27;s decision to release players such as Clint Newton, Kirk Reynoldson, and Josh Perry. Newton&#x27;s took a contract at Melbourne and Reynoldson threatened legal action over the club refusing to play him in the fifteen games required to trigger his fourth contract.

Before the final round of 2007, Tab Sportsbet&#x27;s Glenn Munsie was reported in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; saying that the Newcastle side were certainties for the &#x27;wooden spoon&#x27; (coming last in the season) and &quot;it was pointless taking money on the wooden spoon gong given Newcastle would be firmly planted at the bottom of the ladder by the end of the weekend&quot;. Despite these pressures, the Knights managed to avoid a second wooden spoon in three years – offloading the dreaded piece of &#x27;silverware&#x27; to the Penrith Panthers with a last round victory over the Wests Tigers.

2008 was a resurgence year for the Novocastrians narrowly missing out on the finals. Newcastle started the 2009 NRL season convincingly equaling their best home winning streak of nine wins in 1995. Towards the end of the season coach Brian Smith announced he was leaving Newcastle to join the troubled Sydney Roosters in 2010. Over the next weeks assistant coach Rick Stone was announced as the new coach of the Newcastle club. Toward the end of the season the Knights lost three games in a row which put them in doubt for the finals. They then had an outstanding comeback to beat eventual grand finalists, Parramatta up the ladder. They finished the year 7th out of 16 after losing to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in week one of the finals.

On 16 December 2009 it was announced player Danny Wicks was caught-up in a drug issue involving amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy. He was stood down from the club. Wicks&#x27; contract was terminated. For the 2010 NRL season Newcastle signed McDonald&#x27;s and Coca-Cola as major sponsors. In March 2010 Chris Houston was served with notice to attend court on charges of supplying ecstasy and cocaine. He was stood down indefinitely. June 2010 signalled a good period for the Knights after they confirmed the signings of 2009 Toyota Cup Player of the Year Beau Henry on a three-year contract, 2009 Toyota Cup Centre of the Year Siuatonga Likiliki on a two-year contract and former Australian international prop Antonio Kaufusi on a two-year contract. In the next few days, the Knights also confirmed the signings of current Queensland Maroons star Neville Costigan on a three-year contract, and the promising young backrower Kyle O&#x27;Donnell on a two-year contract.

The Knights finished 11th in 2010. While the club did not play in the finals, Adam MacDougall recorded the most tries for the club and Akuila Uate equaled the most tries in a season. In December 2010, former Newcastle player Chris Houston was cleared of all drug charges and re-signed with the club for two years. In March 2011, Newcastle were officially taken over by mining magnate Nathan Tinkler after a member&#x27;s vote in which Tinkler won by 97%. In April 2011, Newcastle confirmed the signing of Wayne Bennett. The Knights finished 8th in 2011, being eliminated in the first week of the finals. After the 2011 season, the Knights cleaned out 15 players, but nine other renowned players were signed including club legends Danny Buderus and Timana Tahu, Kangaroos winger Darius Boyd and Kangaroos forward Kade Snowden.

The Newcastle club celebrated 25 years in the NRL competition in 2012. Captain Kurt Gidley succumbed to a shoulder injury early in the season which resulted in him missing the remainder of the year. The team failed to click and won only 10 of their 24 games to finish 12th. During the year, the club signed Willie Mason and Dane Gagai.

Newcastle finished 7th on the ladder and making the third week of the finals by beating the Melbourne Storm in Melbourne in the second week of the finals. Newcastle were defeated the following week by the Sydney Roosters in the preliminary final 40–14.

In round 3 of the 2014 NRL Season, Newcastle played against the Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park. Shortly before half time, Newcastle forward Alex McKinnon was involved in a three-man tackle that involved Jordan McLean and the Bromwich brothers (Jesse and Kenny). McKinnon suffered fractures to his C4 and C5 vertebrae. Later in Round 19, the NRL held the &#x27;Rise for Alex Round&#x27;, where for every ticket sold, $1 would be donated to McKinnon to assist with his continuous medical bills and rehabilitation funds.

On 7 July 2015 coach Rick Stone was sacked after a string of disappointing results, and Danny Buderus would coach for the remainder of the 2015 season. In round 26 against Penrith, Newcastle went down 30–12 to claim their second wooden spoon.

In September 2015, Newcastle signed Nathan Brown to a three-year contract to coach starting from 2016. During the 2016 season, the club debuted 11 players in the NRL, while losing co-captain Tariq Sims midway through to year to go to St. George Illawarra. Against Cronulla in round 10, Newcastle were defeated 62–0, their biggest defeat at home and second biggest defeat in history. Newcastle would only win one game all year, to claim the wooden spoon for a second consecutive season, and third overall.

2017 was the Knights&#x27; 30th year in the NRL where they finished last again, claiming their third Wooden Spoon in a row.

In December 2017, the Newcastle Knights expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women&#x27;s season.

In November 2017, the club was sold to The Wests Group, a Newcastle-based not for profit club, after being administered by the NRL since the departure of Nathan Tinkler. The following season marked a resurgence for the club, with the arrivals of high-profile halfback Mitchell Pearce, sought after rookie fullback Kalyn Ponga, as well as Queensland Origin representative Aidan Guerra and several other players. The team started the season strongly, winning five of their opening eight games to sit comfortably inside the top 8. However, with a long-term injury to Mitchell Pearce, the side won only four of their remaining 12 matches to finish 11th.

2019 saw the arrival of forwards David Klemmer and Tim Glasby, boosting the team&#x27;s forward pack. After winning their opening match, Newcastle lost five consecutive games before reversing their fortunes with five consecutive victories to reach 4th place. The Knights would finish in 11th place.
In the 2020 season, Newcastle would reach the finals for the first time since 2013 after finishing 7th on the table. Newcastle were eliminated in the first week of the finals by South Sydney losing 46–20.

In 2021, Newcastle would reach the finals once again finishing 7th on the table. For the second straight year, they would go out in the first week of the finals losing to Parramatta 28–20.
In 2022, the Newcastle side finished 14th on the table winning six games for the entire year.
In round 18 of the 2023 NRL season, Newcastle recorded their biggest ever victory as a club when they defeated Canterbury 66–0.
Newcastle would end up finishing the 2023 NRL season in 5th place after winning nine straight matches, coming from 14th on the table after round 17. In week one of the finals, Newcastle defeated Canberra in extra-time 30–28. In week two, Newcastle would lose 40–10 against the New Zealand Warriors which ended their season.
In the 2024 NRL season, Newcastle would finish in 8th place on the table and qualify for the finals. They would be eliminated in week one of the finals series by North Queensland.

==Club song==

Go Hard, Go Knights (1995–present)

Playin&#x27; hard, playin&#x27; tough,
Just plain good is not good enough,
We&#x27;re gonna show you what league&#x27;s all about,
If there&#x27;s a lesson to be learned we&#x27;re handing it out.

This game is our game,
This town is our town,
Turn the heat up and listen to the crowd.
Go hard, Go Knights, Go proud.

This game is our game,
This town is our town,
Turn the heat up and listen to the crowd.
Go hard, Go Knights, Go proud.

<text>Fear of the Dark is the ninth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Released on 11 May 1992, it was their third studio release to top the UK Albums Chart, and the last to feature Bruce Dickinson as the group&#x27;s lead vocalist until his return in 1999.

It was also the first album to be produced by bassist and band founder Steve Harris, and the last album to feature the work of producer Martin Birch, who retired after its release.

==History==
After recording its predecessor (1990&#x27;s &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;) in a barn on Steve Harris&#x27; property with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, leading to negative results, for this album Harris had the building converted into a proper studio (christened &quot;Barnyard&quot;). Bruce Dickinson describes the results as &quot;a slight improvement because Martin [Birch] came in and supervised the sound. But there were big limitations on that studio – simply because of its physical size, things like that. [It] actually ended up not too bad, but, you know, a little bit under par.&quot;

At 57 minutes and 58 seconds in length, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; was Iron Maiden&#x27;s first double studio LP, as well as the longest album from Dickinson&#x27;s first tenure in the band.

The album&#x27;s musical style showed some experimentation with &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot;, a fast tempo song in a heavier thrash style released as the album&#x27;s first single, and &quot;Wasting Love&quot;, the group&#x27;s first power ballad, which dates back to Dickinson&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;. Both songs were Dickinson/Gers collaborations, which contrasted with Harris&#x27; &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot;, a political song from the point of view of a soldier in the Gulf War, Dickinson would often introduce the song as an anti-war narrative. &quot;Fear Is the Key&quot; is about the fear in sexual relationships resulting from AIDS. The song was written around the time when the band learned about the death of Queen singer Freddie Mercury. Dickinson affirmed: &quot;There&#x27;s a line in &#x27;Fear Is the Key&#x27; that goes: &quot;nobody cares &#x27;til somebody famous dies&quot;. And that&#x27;s quite sadly true. [...] As long as the virus was confined to homosexuals or drug-addicts, nobody gave a shit. It&#x27;s only when celebrities started to die that the masses began to feel concerned&quot;. &quot;Weekend Warrior&quot; is about football hooliganism.

Only two of the album&#x27;s songs, the title track and &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot;, would survive on tours following 1993. &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; has been on the set list of every subsequent tour except 2005, in which the band only played songs from their first 4 albums. ”Fear of the Dark&quot; and &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot; were the only songs played on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and the Maiden England World Tour which were not from the 1980s. &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot; became a frequent addition on setlists during Blaze Bayley&#x27;s tenure with Iron Maiden, following which it returned in 2012.

&quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot;, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and &quot;Wasting Love&quot; were released as singles.

Guitarist Gordon Giltrap released an album of the same title in 1978. Nicko McBrain was earlier a member of Giltrap&#x27;s band and played on his 1973 album &quot;Giltrap&quot;. The Gordon Giltrap logo also uses a font resembling Iron Maiden&#x27;s logo.

Fear of the Dark Tour was the tour supporting the album.

==Album cover==
According to the band&#x27;s biographer, Mick Wall, the &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; album cover depicts their mascot, Eddie, &quot;as some sort of Nosferatu tree figure leering at the moon&quot;. It was the group&#x27;s first not to be designed by artist Derek Riggs, whose contributions were rejected in favour of Melvyn Grant&#x27;s. According to Iron Maiden&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, the band began accepting contributions from other artists as &quot;We wanted to upgrade Eddie for the 90s. We wanted to take him from the sort of comic-book horror creature and turn him into something a bit more straightforward so that he became even more threatening.&quot; Following &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, Grant has produced several more covers for Iron Maiden, making him the band&#x27;s second most-frequent artist after Riggs.

Riggs said in 2006 that he had a dispute with Smallwood and Steve Harris over the cover art concept. He submitted over 20 sketch ideas ranging from Eddie being a werewolf to a vampire and then a monster leaning over the foot of the bed, to which all were rejected. In frustration, Riggs told the manager to &quot;find someone else,&quot; hung up the phone, and would not work with the band for some time.

==Reception==
Reviews for the album were mixed, with AllMusic commenting that, while &quot;easily an improvement over 1990&#x27;s lackluster &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; (both musically and sonically)&quot;, the release &quot;still wasn&#x27;t quite on par with their exceptional work from the &#x27;80s&quot;. Sputnikmusic were more positive about the release, stating that &quot;though many of the songs are still sub-par by their standards ... the band returns to the lofty heights that they enjoyed for the entirety of the 80&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a positive review on release, saying Dickinson&#x27;s voice &quot;shows no sign of wear and tear&quot; and the guitar work &quot;sounds fresh and crisp&quot;.

In October 2011, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; was ranked No. 8 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.

&quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; became the third Iron Maiden album to top the UK Albums Chart. It is the band&#x27;s most successful record in North America after the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1991, with 438,000 copies sold as of 2008.

<text>Planica () is an Alpine valley in northwestern Slovenia, extending south from the border village of Rateče, not far from another well-known ski resort, Kranjska Gora. Further south, the valley extends into the Tamar Valley, a popular hiking destination in Triglav National Park.

Planica is famous for ski jumping. The first ski jumping hill was constructed before 1930 at the slope of Mount Ponca. In 1933, Ivan Rožman constructed a larger hill, known as the Bloudek Giant (&quot;Bloudkova velikanka&quot;) after Stanko Bloudek, which later gave rise to ski flying. The venue was completed in 1934. The first ski jump over in history was achieved at the hill in 1936 by Sepp Bradl. At the time, it was the biggest jumping hill in the world.

In 1969, a new K185 hill, the Gorišek Brothers Flying Hill (&quot;Letalnica bratov Gorišek&quot;) was built by Vlado and Janez Gorišek. The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2023 were held in Planica.

<text>The Emerald Tablet, the Smaragdine Table, or the Tabula Smaragdina is a compact and cryptic Hermetic text. It was a highly regarded foundational text for many Islamic and European alchemists. Though attributed to the legendary Hellenistic figure Hermes Trismegistus, the text of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; first appears in a number of early medieval Arabic sources, the oldest of which dates to the late eighth or early ninth century. It was translated into Latin several times in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Numerous interpretations and commentaries followed.

Medieval and early modern alchemists associated the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; with the creation of the philosophers&#x27; stone and the artificial production of gold.

It has also been popular with nineteenth- and twentieth-century occultists and esotericists, among whom the expression &quot;as above, so below&quot; (a modern paraphrase of the second verse of the &quot;Tablet&quot;) has become an often cited motto.

== Background ==

Beginning from the 1st century BC onwards, Greek texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, appeared in Greco-Roman Egypt. These texts, known as the Hermetica, are a heterogeneous collection of works that in the modern day are commonly subdivided into two groups: the technical Hermetica, comprising astrological, medico-botanical, alchemical, and magical writings; and the religio-philosophical Hermetica, comprising mystical-philosophical writings.

These Greek pseudepigraphal texts found receptions, translations and imitations in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, and Middle Persian prior to the emergence of Islam and the Arab conquests in the 630s. These developments brought about various Arabic-speaking empires in which a new group of Arabic-speaking intellectuals emerged. These scholars received and translated the before-mentioned wealth of texts and also began producing Hermetica of their own.

== History ==
Until the early 20th century, only Latin versions of the Emerald Tablet were known, with the oldest dating back to the 12th century. The first Arabic versions were rediscovered by the English historian of science E.J. Holmyard (1891-1959) and the German orientalist Julius Ruska (1867-1949).

=== Arabic versions ===
The Emerald Tablet has been found in various ancient Arabic works in different versions. The oldest version is found as an appendix in a treatise believed to have been composed in the 9th century, known as the &quot;Book of the Secret of Creation, Kitâb sirr al-Halîka&quot; in Arabic. This text presents itself as a translation of Apollonius of Tyana, under his Arabic name Balînûs. Although no Greek manuscript has been found, it is plausible that an original Greek text existed. The attribution to Apollonius, though false (pseudonymous), is common in medieval Arabic texts on magic, astrology, and alchemy.

The introduction to the &quot;Book of the Secret of Creation&quot; is a narrative that explains, among other things, that &quot;all things are composed of four elemental principles: heat, cold, moisture, and dryness&quot; (the four qualities of Aristotle), and their combinations account for the &quot;relations of sympathy and antipathy between beings.&quot; Balînûs, &quot;master of talismans and wonders,&quot; enters a crypt beneath the statue of Hermes Trismegistus and finds the emerald tablet in the hands of a seated old man, along with a book. The core of the work is primarily an alchemical treatise that introduces for the first time the idea that all metals are formed from sulfur and mercury, a fundamental theory of alchemy in the Middle Ages. The text of the Emerald Tablet appears last, as an appendix. It has long been debated whether it is an extraneous piece, solely cosmogonic in nature, or if it is an integral part of the rest of the work, in which case it has an alchemical significance from the outset. Recently, it has been suggested that it is actually a text of talismanic magic and that the confusion arises from a mistranslation from Arabic to Latin.

Emerald is the stone traditionally associated with Hermes, while mercury is his metal. Mars is associated with red stones and iron, and Saturn is associated with black stones and lead. In antiquity, Greeks and Egyptians referred to various green-coloured minerals (green jasper and even green granite) as emerald, and in the Middle Ages, this also applied to objects made of coloured glass, such as the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; of the Visigothic kings or the Sacro Catino of Genoa (a dish seized by the Crusaders during the sack of Caesarea in 1101, which was believed to have been offered by the Queen of Sheba to Solomon and used during the Last Supper).

This version of the Emerald Tablet is also found in the &quot;Kitab Ustuqus al-Uss al-Thani&quot; (Elementary Book of the Foundation) attributed to the 8th-century alchemist Jâbir ibn Hayyân, known in Europe by the latinized name &quot;Geber&quot;.

Another version is found in an eclectic book from the 10th century, the &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; (Secret of Secrets, &quot;Sirr al-asrâr&quot;), which presents itself as a pseudo-letter from Aristotle to Alexander the Great during the conquest of Persia. It discusses politics, morality, physiognomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, and more. The text is also attributed to Hermes but lacks the narrative of the tablet&#x27;s discovery.

The literary theme of the discovery of Hermes&#x27; hidden wisdom can be found in other Arabic texts from around the 10th century. For example, in the &quot;Book of Crates&quot;, while praying in the temple of Serapis, Crates, a Greek philosopher, has a vision of &quot;an old man, the most beautiful of men, seated in a chair. He was dressed in white garments and held a tablet on the chair, upon which was placed a book [...]. When I asked who this old man was, I was told, &#x27;He is Hermes Trismegistus, and the book before him is one of those that contain the explanation of the secrets he has hidden from men.&#x27;&quot;. A similar account can be found in the Latin text known as &quot;Tabula Chemica&quot; by Senior Zadith, the latinized name of the alchemist Ibn Umail, in which a stone table rests on the knees of Hermes Trismegistus in the secret chamber of a pyramid. Here, the table is not inscribed with text but with &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; symbols.

=== Early Latin versions and medieval commentaries ===

==== Latin versions ====
The &quot;Book of the Secret of Creation&quot; was translated into Latin (&quot;Liber de secretis naturae&quot;) in by Hugo of Santalla. This text does not appear to have been widely circulated.

The &quot;Secret of Secrets&quot; (&quot;Secretum Secretorum)&quot; was translated into Latin in an abridged 188 lines long medical excerpt by John of Seville around 1140. The first full Latin translation of the text was prepared by Philip of Tripoli around a century later. This work has been called &quot;the most popular book of the Latin Middle Ages&quot;.

A third Latin version can be found in an alchemical treatise dating probably from the 12th century (although no manuscripts are known before the 13th or 14th century), the &quot;Liber Hermetis de alchimia&quot; (Book of Alchemy of Hermes). This version, known as the &quot;vulgate,&quot; is the most widespread. The translator of this version did not understand the Arabic word &quot;tilasm,&quot; which means talisman, and therefore merely transcribed it into Latin as &quot;telesmus&quot; or &quot;telesmum&quot;. This accidental neologism was variously interpreted by commentators, thereby becoming one of the most distinctive, yet vague, terms of alchemy.

==== Commentaries ====
In his 1143 treatise, &quot;De essentiis,&quot; Herman of Carinthia is one of a few European 12th century scholars to cite the Emerald Tablet. In this text he also recalls the story of the tablet&#x27;s discovery under a statue of Hermes in a cave from the &quot;Book of the Secret of Creation.&quot; Carinthia was a friend of Robert of Chester, who in 1144 translated the &quot;Liber de compositione alchimiae&quot;, which is generally considered to be the first Latin translation of an Arabic treatise on alchemy.

An anonymous 12th-century commentator tried to explain the neologism &quot;telesmus&quot; in the phrase by claiming it is synonymous with . The translator followed this claim with the assertion that a superior kind of divination among the Arabs is called . In subsequent commentaries of the Emerald Tablet only the meaning of &quot;secret&quot; was retained.

Around 1275–1280, Roger Bacon translated and commented on the &quot;Secret of Secrets&quot;, and through a completely alchemical interpretation of the &quot;Emerald Tablet,&quot; made it an allegorical summary of the Great Work.

The most well-known commentary is that of Hortulanus, an alchemist about whom very little is known, in the first half of the 14th century: This text is in line with the symbolic alchemy that developed in the 14th century, particularly with the texts attributed to the Catalan physician Arnau de Vilanova, which establish an allegorical comparison between Christian mysteries and alchemical operations. In Ortolanus&#x27; commentary, devoid of practical considerations, the Great Work is an imitation of the divine creation of the world from chaos: &quot;And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.&quot;

The sun and the moon represent alchemical gold and silver. Hortulanus interprets &quot;telesma&quot; as &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;treasure&quot;: &quot;It is written afterward: &#x27;The father of all telesma of the world is here,&#x27; that is to say: in the work of the stone is found the final path. And note that the philosopher calls the operation &#x27;father of all telesma,&#x27; that is to say, of all the secret or all the treasure of the entire world, that is to say, of every stone discovered in this world.&quot;.

Starting from 1420, extensive excerpts are included in an illuminated text, the &quot;Aurora consurgens&quot;, which is one of the earliest cycles of alchemical symbols. One of the illustrations shows the discovery of Hermes&#x27; table in a temple surmounted by Sagittarius eagles (representing the volatile elements). This motif is frequently used in Renaissance prints and is the visual expression of the myth of the rediscovery of ancient knowledge—the transmission of this knowledge, in the form of hieroglyphic pictograms, allows it to escape the distortions of human and verbal interpretation.

=== From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment ===


During the Renaissance, the idea that Hermes Trismegistus was the founder of alchemy gained prominence, and at the same time, the legend of the discovery evolved and intertwined with biblical accounts. This is particularly the case in the late 15th century in the &quot;Livre de la philosophie naturelle des métaux&quot; by the pseudo-Bernard of Treviso: &quot;The first inventor of this Art was Hermes Trismegistus, for he knew all three natural philosophies, namely Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal.&quot; This text influenced a discovery legend claiming the tablet to have been discovered after the Biblical Flood in Hebron valley which is connected with the image of the &quot;Emblem of the Smaragdine Tablet&quot; in the 1599 text &quot;Aureum Vellus&quot;.

It further evolves with Jérôme Torella in his book on astrology, &quot;Opus Praeclarum de imaginibus astrologicis&quot; (Valence, 1496), in which it is Alexander the Great who discovers a &quot;Tabula Zaradi&quot; in Hermes&#x27; tomb while travelling to the Oracle of Amun in Egypt. This story is repeated by Michael Maier, physician and counselor to the &quot;alchemical emperor&quot; Rudolf II, in his &quot;symbola aureae mensae&quot; (Frankfurt, 1617), referring to a &quot;Liber de Secretis chymicis&quot; attributed to Albertus Magnus. In the same year, he publishes the famous &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot; (Fleeing Atalanta), illustrated by Theodor de Bry with fifty alchemical emblems, each accompanied by a poem, a musical fugue, and alchemical and mythological explanations. The first two emblems depict a passage from the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;: &quot;the wind has carried it in its belly; the earth is its nurse,&quot; and the explanatory text begins with &quot;Hermes, the most diligent explorer of all natural secrets, describes in his &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; the work of nature, albeit briefly and accurately.&quot;

The first printed edition appears in 1541 in the &quot;De alchemia&quot; published by Johann Petreius and edited by a certain Chrysogonus Polydorus, who is likely a pseudonym for the Lutheran theologian Andreas Osiander (Osiander also edited Copernicus&#x27; &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot; in 1543, published by the same printer). This version is known as the &quot;vulgate&quot; version and includes the commentary by Hortulanus.

In 1583, a commentary by Gerard Dorn is published in Frankfurt by Christoph Corvinus. In &quot;De Luce naturae physica&quot;, this disciple of Paracelsus makes a detailed parallel between the &quot;Table&quot; and the first chapter of the Genesis attributed to Moses.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, verse versions appear, including an anonymous sonnet revised by the alchemical poet in his work &quot;Traittez de l&#x27;harmonie, et constitution generalle du vray sel, secret des Philosophes, &amp; de l&#x27;esprit universel du monde&quot; (1621): 
However, from the beginning of the 17th century onward, a number of authors challenge the attribution of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; to Hermes Trismegistus and, through it, attack antiquity and the validity of alchemy. First among them is a &quot;repentant&quot; alchemist, the Lorraine physician Nicolas Guibert, in 1603. But it is the Jesuit scholar and linguist Athanasius Kircher who launches the strongest attack in his monumental work &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; (Rome, 1652–1653). He notes that no texts speak of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; before the Middle Ages and that its discovery by Alexander the Great is not mentioned in any ancient testimonies. By comparing the vocabulary used with that of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; (which had been proven by Isaac Casaubon in 1614 to date only from the 2nd or 3rd century AD), he affirms that the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; is a forgery by a medieval alchemist. As for the alchemical teaching of the &quot;Emerald Tablet,&quot; it is not limited to the philosopher&#x27;s stone and the transmutation of metals but concerns &quot;the deepest substance of each thing,&quot; the alchemists&#x27; &quot;quintessence&quot;. From another perspective, publishes in 1657 a commentary in which he tries to demonstrate, using the linguistic methods of the time, that the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; was not originally written in Egyptian but in Phoenician.
He continues his studies of ancient texts and in 1684 argues that Hermes Trismegistus is not the Egyptian Thoth but the Taaut of the Phoenicians, who is also the founder of the Germanic people under the name of the god Tuisto, mentioned by Tacitus.

In the meantime, Kircher&#x27;s conclusions are debated by the Danish alchemist Ole Borch in his &quot;De ortu et progressu Chemiae&quot; (1668), in which he attempts to separate the hermetic texts between the late writings and those truly attributable to the ancient Egyptian Hermes, among which he inclines to classify the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;. The discussions continue, and the treatises of Ole Borch and Kriegsmann are reprinted in the compilation &quot;Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa&quot; (1702) by the Swiss physician Jean-Jacques Manget. Although the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; is still translated and commented upon by Isaac Newton, alchemy gradually loses all scientific credibility during the 18th century with the advent of modern chemistry and the work of Lavoisier.

==== The emblem of the &quot;Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis&quot; ====

From the late 16th century onwards, the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; is often accompanied by a symbolic figure called the &quot;Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis&quot;.

This figure is surrounded by an acrostic in whose seven initials form the word . At the top, the sun and moon pour into a cup above the symbol of mercury. Around the mercurial cup are the four other planets, representing the classic association between the seven planets and the seven metals: Sol/Gold, Luna/Silver, Mercury/Quicksilver, Jupiter/Tin, Mars/Iron, Venus/Copper, Saturn/Lead. It is unclear if the image was originally drawn using colours or not. The ones which do contain them are coloured as follows gold-sol-visita, silver-luna-interiora, grey-mercury-terrae, blue-tin-rectificando, red-iron-invenies, green-copper, black-lead-lapidem. In the center, there are a ring and a globus cruciger, and at the bottom, there are the spheres of the sky and the earth. Three charges represent, according to the poem, the three principles (&quot;tria prima&quot;) of the alchemical theory of Paracelsus: Eagle/Mercury/Spirit, Lion/Sulfur/Soul, and Star/Salt/Body. Finally, two Schwurhands accompany the picture attesting its creator&#x27;s veracity.

The oldest known reproduction is a copy dated 1588-89 of a manuscript that was circulating anonymously at the time and was likely written in the second half of the 16th century by a German Paracelsian. The image was accompanied by a didactic alchemical poem in German titled &quot;Du secret des sages&quot;, probably by the same author. The poem explains the symbolism in relation to the Great Work and the classical goals of alchemy: wealth, health, and long life. Initially, it was only accompanied by the text of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; as a secondary element. However, in printed reproductions during the 17th century, the accompanying poem disappeared, and the emblem became known as the &quot;Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis&quot;, the symbol or graphical representation of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;, as ancient as the tablet itself.

For example, in 1733, according to the alchemist Ehrd de Naxagoras (&quot;Supplementum Aurei Velleris&quot;), a &quot;precious emerald plate&quot; engraved with inscriptions and the symbol was made upon Hermes&#x27; death and found in the valley of Ebron by a woman named Zora. This emblem is placed within the mysterious tradition of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the idea of Platonists and alchemists during the Renaissance that the &quot;deepest secrets of nature could only be expressed appropriately through an obscure and veiled mode of representation&quot;.

=== 19th–20th century: from occultism to esotericism and surrealism ===

Alchemy and its alleged &quot;foundational text&quot; continue to interest occultists. This is the case with the mage Éliphas Lévi: &quot;Nothing surpasses and nothing equals as a summary of all the doctrines of the old world the few sentences engraved on a precious stone by Hermes and known as the &#x27;emerald tablet&#x27;... it is all of magic on a single page.&quot;. It also applies to the &quot;curious figure&quot; of the German Gottlieb Latz, who self-published a monumental work &quot;Die Alchemie&quot; in 1869, as well as the theosophist Helena Blavatsky and the perennialist Titus Burckhardt.

At the beginning of the 20th century, alchemical thought resonated with the surrealists, and André Breton incorporated the main axiom of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; into the &quot;Second Manifesto of Surrealism&quot; (1930): &quot;Everything leads us to believe that there exists a certain point of the spirit from which life and death, the real and the imaginary, the past and the future, the communicable and the incommunicable, the high and the low, cease to be perceived as contradictory. However, in vain would one seek any motive other than the hope for the determination of this point in surrealist activity.&quot;. Although some commentators mainly see the influence of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in this statement, Hegel&#x27;s philosophy itself was influenced by Jakob Böhme.

==Textual history==

Like most other works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; is very hard to date with any precision, but generally belongs to the late antique period (between and ). The oldest known source of the text is the (&quot;The Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature&quot;, also known as the or &quot;The Book of Causes&quot;), an encyclopaedic work on natural philosophy falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (, Arabic: or ). This book was compiled in Arabic in the late eighth or early ninth century, but it was most likely based on (much) older Greek and/or Syriac sources. In the frame story of the , tells his readers that he discovered the text in a vault below a statue of Hermes in Tyana, and that, inside the vault, an old corpse on a golden throne held the emerald tablet.

Slightly different versions of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; also appear in the (&quot;The Second Book of the Element of the Foundation&quot;, ) attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, in the longer version of the (&quot;The Secret of Secrets&quot;, a tenth-century compilation of earlier works that was falsely attributed to Aristotle), and in the Egyptian alchemist Muhammed ibn Umail al-Tamimi&#x27;s (ca. 900 – 960) (&quot;Book of the Silvery Water and the Starry Earth&quot;).

The &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; was translated into Latin in the twelfth century by Hugo of Santalla as part of his translation of the . It was again translated into Latin along with the thirteenth-century translation of the longer version of the pseudo-Aristotelian (Latin: ). However, the Latin translation which formed the basis for all later versions (the so-called &#x27;Vulgate&#x27;) was originally part of an anonymous compilation of alchemical commentaries on the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; variously called , , or (first half of the twelfth century).

===Arabic versions of the tablet text===

====From pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s (c. 750–850)====

The earliest known version of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; on which all later versions were based is found in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s (&quot;The Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature&quot;).

====From the (ca. 850–950) attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan====

A somewhat shorter version is quoted in the (&quot;The Second Book of the Element of the Foundation&quot;) attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. Lines 6, 8, and 11–15 from the version in the are missing, while other parts seem to be corrupt. Jabir&#x27;s version was translated by Eric J. Holmyard:
====From the pseudo-Aristotelian (tenth century)====

A still later version is found in the pseudo-Aristotelian (&quot;Secret of Secrets&quot;, tenth century).

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Medieval Latin versions of the tablet text===

====From the Latin translation of pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s ()====

The tablet was translated into Latin in by Hugo of Santalla as part of his translation of the (&quot;The Secret of Creation&quot;, original Arabic above).

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

====From the Latin translation of the pseudo-Aristotelian ()====

The tablet was also translated into Latin as part of the longer version of the pseudo-Aristotelian (Latin: , original Arabic above). It differs significantly both from the translation by Hugo of Santalla (see above) and the Vulgate translation (see below).&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

====Vulgate (from the or )====

The most widely distributed Latin translation (the so-called &#x27;Vulgate&#x27;) is found in an anonymous compilation of commentaries on the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; that was translated from a lost Arabic original. This alchemical compilation was variously called , , or . Its translator has been tentatively identified as Plato of Tivoli, who was active in . However, this is merely a conjecture, and although it can be deduced from other indices that the text dates to the first half of the twelfth century, its translator remains unknown.

The Vulgate version also differs significantly from the other two early Latin versions. A critical edition based on eight manuscripts was prepared by Robert Steele and Dorothea W. Singer in 1928:

===Early modern versions of the tablet text===
====Latin (Nuremberg, 1541)====
Despite some small differences, the 16th-century Nuremberg edition of the Latin text remains largely similar to the vulgate (see above). A translation by Isaac Newton is found among his alchemical papers that are currently housed in King&#x27;s College Library, Cambridge University:
==Influence==

In its several Western recensions, the &quot;Tablet&quot; became a mainstay of medieval and Renaissance alchemy. Commentaries and/or translations were published by, among others, Trithemius, Roger Bacon, Michael Maier, Albertus Magnus, and Isaac Newton. The concise text was a popular summary of alchemical principles, wherein the secrets of the philosophers&#x27; stone were thought to have been described.

The fourteenth-century alchemist Ortolanus (or Hortulanus) wrote a substantial exegesis on &quot;The Secret of Hermes&quot;, which was influential on the subsequent development of alchemy. Many manuscripts of this copy of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; and the commentary of Ortolanus survive, dating at least as far back as the fifteenth century. Ortolanus, like Albertus Magnus before him saw the tablet as a cryptic recipe that described laboratory processes using &quot;deck names&quot; (or code words). This was the dominant view held by Europeans until the fifteenth century.

By the early sixteenth century, the writings of Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) marked a shift away from a laboratory interpretation of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;, to a metaphysical approach. Trithemius equated Hermes&#x27; &quot;one thing&quot; with the monad of pythagorean philosophy and the anima mundi. This interpretation of the Hermetic text was adopted by alchemists such as John Dee, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and Gerhard Dorn.

==In popular culture==
In the time travel television series &quot;Dark&quot;, the mysterious priest Noah has a large image of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; tattooed on his back. The image, which is from Heinrich Khunrath&#x27;s &quot;Amphitheatre of Eternal Wisdom&quot; (1609), also appears on a metal door in the caves that are central to the plot. Several characters are shown looking at copies of the text. A line from the Latin version, &quot;&quot; (So was the world created), plays a prominent thematic role in the series and is the title of the sixth episode of the first season.

In 1974, Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor recorded a studio album under the name (&quot;The Emerald Tablet&quot;), quoting from the Tablet&#x27;s text and from alchemy in general in several songs. The album has been defined as an exercise in &quot;musical alchemy&quot; and celebrated as Ben Jor&#x27;s greatest musical achievement, blending together samba, jazz, and rock rhythms.

<text>Amorphophallus konjac, also known as konnyaku, and konjac, is a plant species native to Yunnan in southwestern China, which has an edible corm. It is sometimes referred to as devil&#x27;s tongue, voodoo lily, snake palm, or elephant yam. It is a relative of the titan arum (&quot;A. titanum&quot;), one of the largest flowering plants in the world and a congener of konjac.

Konjac is cultivated in warm subtropical to tropical areas of East and Southeast Asia, from China and Japan south to Indonesia and Vietnam (USDA hardiness zone 6–11). It is a perennial plant, growing from a large corm up to 25 cm (10 in) in diameter. The single leaf is up to 1.3 m (4 ft) across, bipinnate, and divided into numerous leaflets. The flowers are produced on a spathe enclosed by a dark purple spadix up to 55 cm (22 in) long.

The food made from the corm is known in English by its Japanese name, &quot;konnyaku&quot;. Two basic types of cake are made from konjac, white and black, as well as noodles, called &quot;shirataki&quot;. The corm of the konjac is often colloquially referred to as a &quot;yam&quot;, though it is not related to tubers of the family Dioscoreaceae.

==History==
Wild forms grow naturally in China and Southeast Asia. Konjac has been used in Japan since the 6th century, as a supposed medicinal food. Japanese documents from around the 18th century mentions its intestinal cleansing property. Nakajima Toemon developed a method to produce konjac flour in 1776, which are more durable for transportation and storage, contributing to their wider consumption.

==Cultivation and use==


Konjac is grown in East and Southeast Asia and it is prized for its large starchy corms, used to create a flour and jelly of the same name. It is also used as a vegan substitute for gelatin.

In Japan, over 90% of all domestically produced konjac is made in Gunma Prefecture.

===East Asia===
In Japanese cuisine, konjac (&quot;konnyaku&quot;) appears in dishes such as &quot;oden&quot;. It is typically mottled grey and firmer in consistency than most gelatins. It has very little flavor; the common variety tastes vaguely like salt, usually with a slightly oceanic taste and smell (from the seaweed powder added to it, though some forms omit the seaweed). 

In Japan, it is valued more for its texture than flavor. 
 is a Japanese food consisting of konjac cut into noodle-like strips. It is usually sold in plastic bags with accompanying water, which is drained before cooking. The name literally means &#x27;thread-konjac&#x27;.

Japanese &quot;konnyaku&quot; is made by mixing konjac flour with water and limewater. Konjac cannot be eaten raw because it contains oxalic acid. The product come in various shades of gray; &quot;konnyaku&quot; made from corm are naturally dark, while those made from konjac flour are white. &quot;Hijiki&quot; is often added for the characteristic dark color and flavor. It is then boiled and cooled to solidify. Konjac made in noodle form is called &quot;shirataki&quot; and used in foods such as &quot;sukiyaki&quot; and &quot;gyūdon&quot;.

Konjac is consumed in parts of China&#x27;s Sichuan province; the corm is called &quot;moyu&quot; (), and the jelly is called &quot;konjac tofu&quot; ( &quot;móyù dòufu&quot;) or &quot;snow konjac&quot; ( &quot;xuě móyù&quot;).

In Vietnam, konjac is mainly grown in the An Giang province. The corms are collected and processed into flour. The flour is used to make drinks, cakes, and noodles.

===Traditional medicine===
The dried corm of the konjac plant contains around 40% glucomannan gum. This polysaccharide makes konjac jelly a viscous substance that may be used in traditional Chinese medicine.

===Fruit jelly===
Konjac can also be made into a popular East Asian fruit jelly snack, known variously in the US as lychee cups (after a typical flavor) or konjac candy, usually served in bite-sized plastic cups. This fruit jelly was first sold in Japan in 1979.

====Choking risk====
Perhaps because of several highly publicized deaths and near-deaths in the San Francisco Bay Area among children and elderly people caused by suffocation while eating konjac candy, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued product warnings in 2001, and there were subsequent recalls in the US and Canada. Choking and intestinal blockage risk warnings have been published at more recent websites.

Unlike gelatine and some other commonly used gelling agents, konjac fruit jelly does not melt readily in the mouth. Some products form a gel strong enough to require chewing to disintegrate the gel. Though the product is intended to be eaten by gently squeezing the container, a consumer can suck the product out with enough force to unintentionally lodge it in the trachea. Because of this hazard, the European Union and Australia banned konjac fruit jelly.

Some konjac jelly snacks are not of a size and consistency that pose a choking risk, but are nonetheless affected by the government bans. Some products that remain in East Asian markets have an increased size, unusual shape, and more delicate consistency than the round, plug-like gels that were associated with the choking incidents. The snacks usually have warning labels advising parents to make sure their children chew the jelly thoroughly before swallowing.

Japan&#x27;s largest manufacturer of konjac snacks, MannanLife, temporarily stopped producing the jellies after a 21-month-old Japanese boy choked to death on a frozen MannanLife konjac jelly. 17 people died from choking on konjac between 1995 and 2008. MannanLife konjac jelly&#x27;s packaging added a note to consumers, advising them to cut the product into smaller pieces before serving it to small children. To prevent such accidents, they developed and began selling drinkable konjac jelly in 2005.

In 1999, 8-year-old Michelle Enrile from San Jose, California, choked on a piece of konjac gel candy. She lapsed into a coma and died 27 months later at age 11. The Enriles won a $16.7 million judgment against the Taiwanese manufacturer of the candy.

===Vegan seafood alternative===
Konjac corm powder has a noticeably fishy smell and is used as an ingredient in vegan alternative seafood products. It can be incorporated into plant-based versions of seafood. For Chinese cooking, thin strands of konjac gel can be used as substitute for shark fins when preparing a plant-based version of shark fin soup.

===Other uses===
Konjac can also be used for facial massage accessories, which are popular in Korea and gaining popularity in the West. Most commonly this is through the use of a konjac sponge, which is unique in that it can be used on sensitive skin that may become easily irritated with more common exfoliating tools (such as loofahs or washcloths).

It can be used in the formulation of drugs and devices such as oral colon-targeting drug delivery systems (OCDDS), which enable drugs to be delivered directly to the colon.

In traditional hand papermaking in Japan, konnyaku imparts strength to paper for dyeing, rubbing, folding—and other manipulations, such as momigami.

Shirataki noodles have gained popularity in the US for their low carbohydrate content.

<text>The Denver Zephyrs (formerly the Denver Bears) were a Minor League Baseball team based in Denver, Colorado, United States. They were a Triple-A team that played in the American Association from 1955 to 1962, the Pacific Coast League from 1963 to 1968, and the American Association again from 1969 to 1992. They played their home games at Mile High Stadium.

The Zephyrs won the American Association championship on seven occasions: 1957, 1971, 1976, 1977, 1981, 1983, and 1991. They also won the 1957 Junior World Series and the 1991 Triple-A Classic.

==History==
===Origins===
Denver, Colorado, had been the home of numerous minor league baseball teams dating back to 1885 with an unnamed team of the Colorado State League. Off and on from 1901 to 1954, the city was represented by the Denver Bears of the Western League. In 1955, the Class A Bears were replaced by a Triple-A team of the American Association. This came about when the Kansas City Blues were forced to relocate after the American League&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City, Missouri, to become the Kansas City Athletics.

===Denver Bears (1955–1983)===
Although naming a team for its uniform color had been popular in the 19th century, it was not fashionable in the 20th. As Denver had no connection to the original Blues, and in recognition of the new location in the Rockies, the team became known as Bears.

The new Denver team played at what became known later as Mile High Stadium, but was originally known as Bears Stadium, after the team. This ballpark was one of the largest venues in history to host minor league baseball on a routine basis, and had the additional draw of being in one of the largest minor league markets at the time. For many years, the biggest crowds were on Independence Day fireworks nights, and the American Association scheduled the Bears for a home game every year. It was on these nights that the Bears drew the largest crowds in minor league baseball history. On July 4, 1982, the Bears drew an all-time minor league record of 65,666 for a game against the Omaha Royals, breaking their own record of 59,691 set on July 4 of the previous year.

The Triple-A Bears were affiliated with the New York Yankees at the outset, with Ralph Houk managing many players who would reach the majors and play in the World Series. The team had some early success, winning the American Association championship in 1957. League MVPs in this period included Marv Throneberry in 1956 and Steve Boros in 1960.

Although the team had been a member of the American Association since the league&#x27;s inception 60 years before, it was a Midwestern circuit, so for the 1963 season, the Bears transferred to the Pacific Coast League. The mid-1960s Bears included such future big-leaguers as César Tovar and Ted Uhlaender, but lacked overall success. It also turned out that with the PCL otherwise all but confined to the actual Pacific Coast, Denver was now located too far east. In 1969, the franchise returned to the American Association.

The Denver Bears had some good teams from the 1970s to the mid-1980s, producing such players as Andre Dawson, Tim Wallach, Warren Cromartie, Tim Raines, Graig Nettles, Terry Francona, Wallace Johnson, Danny Morris, Pat Rooney, and Bill Gullickson. Denver players Richie Scheinblum (1971), Cliff Johnson (1973), Roger Freed (1976), Frank Ortenzio (1977), and Randy Bass (1980) were league MVPs. The managing careers of both Billy Martin and Felipe Alou began with the Bears. The team won the Association&#x27;s championship with some regularity, topping the league in 1971, 1976, 1977, 1981, and 1983. The 1980 Bears were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.

===Denver Zephyrs (1984–1992)===

In 1984, the team name was changed to the Denver Zephyrs, after the famous passenger train. Barry Larkin (1986) was league MVP while with the Zephyrs, as were Greg Vaughn (1989), Jim Olander (1991), and Jim Tatum (1992). ESPN broadcaster Orestes Destrade also played for the Zephyrs. On June 3, 1987, Zephyrs player Joey Meyer hit the longest verified home run in American professional baseball history at 582 feet.

The Zephyrs&#x27; only championship under the new nickname was the 1991 American Association title. They went on to win the 1991 Triple-A Classic against the International League&#x27;s Columbus Clippers, 4–1.

Major League Baseball came to Denver with the arrival of the Colorado Rockies expansion team of the National League in 1993. After 39 seasons of play, the Zephyrs relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, after the 1992 season where they continued as the New Orleans Zephyrs.

==Notable players==

*Narciso Elvira - played with the Zephyrs after his stint in the Major League Baseball with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1990
*Joey Meyer - holds the record for the longest home run in professional baseball history at , which he hit June 3, 1987, at Denver&#x27;s Mile High Stadium

<text>The socialist market economy (SME) is the economic system and model of economic development employed in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The system is a market economy with the predominance of public ownership and state-owned enterprises. The term &quot;socialist market economy&quot; was introduced by Jiang Zemin during the 14th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1992 to describe the goal of China&#x27;s economic reforms.

Originating in the Chinese economic reforms initiated in 1978 that integrated China into the global market economy, the socialist market economy represents a preliminary or &quot;primary stage&quot; of developing socialism. Some commentators describe the system as a form of &quot;state capitalism&quot;, while others describe it as an original evolution of Marxism, in line with Marxism–Leninism similar to the &quot;New Economic Policy&quot; of the Soviet Union, adapted to the cohabitation with a globalized capitalist system.

== Description ==
In the late 1970s, then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and the CCP leadership rejected the prior Maoist emphasis on culture and political agency as the driving forces behind economic progress and started to place a greater emphasis on advancing the material productive forces as the fundamental and necessary prerequisite for building an advanced socialist society. The adoption of market reforms was seen to be consistent with China&#x27;s level of development and a necessary step in advancing the productive forces of society. This aligned Chinese policy with a more traditional Marxist perspective where a fully developed socialist planned economy can only come into existence after a market economy has exhausted its historical role and gradually transforms itself into a planned economy, nudged by technological advances that make economic planning possible and therefore market relations less necessary. In Deng&#x27;s view, both state planning and market mechanisms were tools to liberate productivity, and that while a capitalist market economy is dominated by individualism, a socialist market economy would lead to common prosperity.

The socialist market economy is presented by the CCP as an early stage in the development of socialism (this stage is variously called the &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;preliminary&quot; stage of socialism), where public ownership coexists alongside a diverse range of non-public forms of ownership. 

In the CCP&#x27;s view, China is not a capitalist country because despite the co-existence of private capitalists and entrepreneurs with public and collective enterprise, the party retains control over the direction of the country. However, many scholars consider the Chinese economic model as an example of authoritarian capitalism, state capitalism or party-state capitalism.

Proponents of this economic model distinguish it from market socialism as market socialists believe that economic planning is unattainable, undesirable or ineffective and thus view the market as an integral part of socialism whereas proponents of the socialist market economy view markets as a temporary phase in development of a fully planned economy.

Cui Zhiyuan traces the theoretical foundations of the socialist market economy to James Meade&#x27;s model of liberal socialism in which the state acts as a residual claimant on the profits generated by state-owned enterprises that are operated independent of government management.

Writing for English-language readers, academics Christopher Marquis and Kunyuan Qiao state that to avoid the incorrect assumption that &quot;market economy&quot; is the core idea, a more appropriate translation would be &quot;market economy within the Chinese socialist system.&quot; In Marquis and Qiao&#x27;s view, this alternative translation better reflects the subordination of &quot;market&quot; to &quot;socialist system.&quot;

== History ==

After the Great Leap Forward (1958–1961) and the ousting of the Gang of Four from power in 1976, Deng Xiaoping (paramount leader from 1978 to 1989) refocused China&#x27;s efforts on economic growth and on finding an economic system compatible with China&#x27;s specific conditions. However, in doing so he remained committed to the Leninist model of centralized political control and a one-party state.

Jiang Zemin originally introduced the term &quot;socialist market economy&quot; in 1992. He had coined the idea so that China could learn the lessons from capitalist countries without needing to discuss if the reforms are &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;capitalist.&quot; Jiang had asked Deng Xiaoping if he had approved of the term, which he did. The Đổi Mới in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam later adopted the concept. Following its implementation, this economic system has supplemented the command economy in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with high growth-rates in GDP during the past decades having been attributed to it. Within this model, privately owned enterprises have become a major component of the economic system alongside the central state-owned enterprises and the collective/township village enterprises.

The transition to a socialist market economy began in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping introduced his program of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Initial reforms in decollectivizing agriculture and opening the economy to foreign investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s later led to large-scale radical reforms, including corporatization of the state sector, partial privatization of some enterprises, liberalization of trade and prices and dismantling of the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; system of job security in the late 1990s.

During Deng&#x27;s 1992 Southern Tour, Deng promoted the ideological basis for the socialist market economy, stating his view that &quot;[p]lanned economy does not equal socialism and market economy does not equal capitalism. Socialism can have market mechanisms as well, and government planning and market are both economic means.&quot;

In 1993, the CCP issued its &quot;Decision on Issues Related to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System.&quot; In the wave of reform thereafter, one goal was to separate SOE management from government and to empower a select group of SOEs with special property rights and autonomy. In 1994, China devalued the renminbi by 33 percent as part of socialist market economy reforms.

== Analysis ==
Some scholars have described China&#x27;s economic system as a form of state capitalism, particularly after the industrial reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, noting that while the Chinese economy maintains a large state sector, the state-owned enterprises operate like private-sector firms and retain all profits without remitting them to the government to benefit the entire population. This model brings into question the rationale for widespread public ownership as well as the applicability of the descriptor &quot;socialist&quot;, and has led to concern and debate regarding the distribution of state profits. Others have labeled it &quot;party-state capitalism.&quot;

Starting in 2017 as part of its state-owned enterprise reform program, the central government began to encourage state-owned enterprises to start paying dividends to the government. Other reforms have transferred state-owned assets to social-security funds to help finance pensions, and the Shenzhen municipal government has proposed using their state-owned enterprises to finance a social dividend-type of system for its residents.

Chinese economist Cui Zhiyuan argues that James Meade&#x27;s model of liberal socialism is similar to China&#x27;s socialist market economy and can be used to make sense of the model. Meade&#x27;s model of market socialism involved public ownership of firms with independent management - with the state acting as a residual claimant to the profits generated by its enterprises, but without exercising control rights over the management and operations of its firms. This model has the advantage that the state would have a source of income independent of taxation and debt, enabling a reduction of the tax burden on individual incomes and the private sector while promoting greater equality. Cui points to the Chongqing experience with municipal state-owned enterprises enabling high social expenditure alongside low taxes and extremely high rates of growth as validation of the socialist market economy model. The Chongqing model used state enterprise profits to fund public services (including housing), providing the main source of public finance and enabling Chongqing to lower its corporate tax rate (15% compared to the 33% national corporate tax rate) to attract foreign investment.

Julan Du and Chenggang Xu analyzed the Chinese model in a 2005 paper to assess whether it represents a type of market socialism or capitalism. They concluded that China&#x27;s contemporary economic system represents a form of capitalism rather than market socialism because: (1) financial markets exist which permit private share ownership—a feature absent in the economic literature on market socialism; and (2) state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being distributed among the population in a social dividend or similar scheme, which are central features in most models of market socialism. Du and Xu concluded that China is not a market socialist economy, but an unstable form of capitalism.

Another analysis carried out by the Global Studies Association at the DePaul University in 2006 reports that the Chinese economic system does not constitute a form of socialism when socialism is defined as a planned economy where production for use has replaced production for profit as the driving force behind economic activity, or when socialism is defined as a system where the working class is the dominant class which controls the surplus value produced by the economy. The Chinese economy also does not constitute socialism in the sense of widespread self-management or workplace democracy. The study concluded that as of 2006 capitalism is not the dominant mode of organization either and China instead has a partially pre-capitalist agrarian system with almost 50% of its population engaged in agricultural work.

In 2015 Curtis J. Milhaupt and Wentong Zheng classified China&#x27;s economic system as state capitalism because the state directs and guides all major aspects of the Chinese economy—including both the state and private sectors&quot;—&quot;while not collecting dividends from the ownership of its enterprises. They noted that Chinese state-owned enterprises and privately owned enterprises shared many similarities with respect to state subsidies, proximity to state power and execution of government policy objectives. Within the state sector, the emphasis was more on government control than on the ownership of assets.

Proponents of the socialist market economy compare it to the New Economic Policy in 1920s Soviet Russia that introduced market-oriented reforms while maintaining state-ownership of the commanding heights of the economy. The reforms are justified through the belief that changing conditions necessitate new strategies for socialist development.

According to Li Rongrong, in 2003 the chairman of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, China&#x27;s socialist economic system is underpinned by the foundational role of public enterprise: 

Other Marxist analyses point out that because the Chinese economic system is based on commodity production, has a role for private capital and disempowers the working class, it represents a capitalist economy. Classical Marxists believe a socialist commodity economy (or a socialist market economy) is contradictory. Other socialists believe the Chinese have embraced many elements of market capitalism, specifically commodity production and privatization, resulting in a full-blown capitalist economic system. In the past, although many enterprises were nominally publicly owned, the profits were retained by the enterprises and used to pay managers excessively high salaries rather than being distributed amongst the population. In 2020, the &quot;commanding role&quot; of the CCP over SOEs was cemented in law and SOEs have been required to have Staff and Worker Representative Congresses (SWRCs), a form of workplace democracy, with 80% of registered companies in China having them, including some private sector companies.

== Characteristics ==
=== Enterprise and ownership types ===
Public ownership in the socialist market economy consists of state-owned assets, collectively owned enterprises and the publicly owned shares of mixed enterprises. These various forms of public ownership play a dominant role in the socialist market economy alongside substantial private and foreign enterprises.

The principles of the socialist market economy legitimized the idea that ownership of state-owned enterprises could be structured in various forms, including majority state-owned joint stock companies. There are a few major forms of state-owned enterprises in China today:
* State-owned enterprises: commercial enterprises established by either the central government or a local government, where managers are appointed by the government or public bodies. This category only includes wholly state-funded and managed firms. Most state-owned enterprises are not entities of the central government. Central government state-owned enterprises are subunits of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
* State-holding enterprises: state-holding, or state-controlled enterprises, are publicly listed firms where the state owns a large share or a controlling share within the firms, thereby exerting influence on the management of the firm. These include firms that receive foreign direct investment.
* State joint ownership enterprises:

=== State sector ===
The socialist market economy consists of a wide range of state-owned enterprises (SOE) that represent one form of public ownership. As of the end of 2019, China&#x27;s SOEs represented 4.5% of the global economy. State-owned enterprises accounted for over 60% of China&#x27;s market capitalization in 2019 and generated 40% of China&#x27;s GDP of US$15.97trillion (101.36 trillion yuan) in 2020, with domestic and foreign private businesses and investment accounting for the remaining 60%. Ninety-one (91) of these SOEs belong to the 2020 Fortune Global 500 companies.

Beginning with the 1978 reforms, in the 1980s during the industrial reforms state enterprises were gradually corporatized and transformed into joint-stock corporations with the state retaining either full or majority ownership of their shares. By the early 2000s, most major SOEs in non-strategic sectors were listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges and some SOEs adopted mixed ownership structures where the central government and various other state entities—including state banks, other SOEs, provincial and local governments—own varying degrees of the firm&#x27;s listed shares alongside foreign and private shareholders. The result has been a highly diffuse form of public ownership where state-owned enterprises are owned by various different government entities, agencies and other state-owned enterprises. This makes gauging the true size and scope of the state sector difficult, particularly when SOEs with mixed ownership structures are taken into account. In 2013, the public sector accounted for 30% of the number of firms in China, but 55% of assets, 45% of revenue and 40% of profits.

In 1996, China implemented a comprehensive series of industrial reforms termed &quot;Grasping the large, letting go of the small&quot;. These reforms involved closing unprofitable state enterprises, merging smaller enterprises and privatization of other small-to-medium enterprises. Centrally owned SOEs were reformed into joint-stock companies with the aim of delegating more authority to SOE managers. SOEs at all levels shifted their primary focus to profitability and shed their social welfare function of providing social services and benefits to their workers in what was known as the &quot;Iron Rice Bowl&quot; system. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) was formed in 2003 to oversee the management of the large centrally owned state enterprises.

Modern SOEs are operationally very different from those in the 1990s. SOEs are much larger in size and fewer in number, with central government-owned SOEs clustered in &quot;strategic sectors&quot; including banking, finance, mining, energy, transportation, telecommunications and public utilities. By comparison, provincial and municipal level SOEs number in the thousands and are involved in almost every industry including information technology and automobiles design and production. State sector reform is an ongoing process in China. As of 2017, the CCP has rejected the Singapore model of Temasek-style state investment companies for China&#x27;s SOEs, where SOEs operate solely to maximize profits on a commercial basis. In particular, China maintains that centrally owned SOEs also pursue national and industrial policy objectives. As a result of recent reforms to increase profitability and unload debt, the government reported the profits of central government-owned SOEs rose by 15.2% in 2017.

Despite becoming increasingly profitable, SOEs in China have not paid dividends to the state, causing some analysts question the rationale for public ownership in the first place. As part of SASAC&#x27;s ongoing reforms, SOEs will now be encouraged and required to pay a higher portion of their profits as dividends to the state, with some state-owned assets being transferred to social security funds to help finance pensions for China&#x27;s aging population. This is part of a broader reform effort of restructuring the state sector to become a source of finance for public services. As part of the SOE reform goals outlined in 2015 by SASAC, SOEs are to be classified as either commercial or public service entities, with the former being required to distribute a higher proportion of their profits as dividends. Dividend payments are set to rise from 5–15% to 30% by 2020.

=== Private sector ===
Privately owned enterprises (POEs) are recognized as one of the components of the socialist market economy alongside state, collective and individually owned enterprises. The private sector has played an increasingly large role since the adoption of the 1994 Company Law. Additionally, the boundary between public and private enterprises have blurred in China as many publicly listed firms are under mixed ownership by various state and non-state entities. Additionally, private sector firms that operate in industries targeted for growth often receive favorable loans and preferential government treatment while SOEs in non-strategic sectors might be exempt from subsidies. As an example, ZTE Corporation is a majority state-owned enterprise that was forced to rely on equity markets whereas its employee-owned private sector competitor Huawei is viewed as a &quot;national champion&quot; and therefore received major state funding from state banks. Like their state-owned counterparts POEs are expected to follow state policies and are subject to CCP control, suggesting that the distinction between public and private ownership is not a meaningful distinction to make for understanding China&#x27;s economic model. As of 2015, state control and state-directed development (in both public and private sectors) is the overriding feature of the Chinese economic system that plays a more substantial role than the public ownership of assets.

While the private sector has been accorded a role in the socialist market economy and has greatly increased in size and scope since the 1990s, the private sector does not dominate the Chinese economy. The exact size of the private sector is difficult to determine in part because private enterprises may have a minority of their stock owned by state entities and because of different classification standards used for classifying enterprises. For example, in the first quarter of 2016 the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported fixed investment by private firms at 35%, and by wholly state-owned SOEs at 27%, with the bulk of the remainder belonging to non-wholly state funded limited liability corporations.

=== Economic planning ===
The 1993 CCP decision overhauled the organization of China&#x27;s planning apparatus. Planning was not abolished, but instead reframed as one of three key mechanisms of macro-economic control, along with fiscal policy and monetary policy. Chinese administrators were instructed to plan for markets and to absorb major market trends (both domestically and internationally) into multi-year government programs.

In 2003, the State Planning Commission being reformed into the National Development and Reform Commission in 2003. Indicative planning and industrial policies have substituted material balance planning and play a substantial role in guiding the market economy for both the state and private sectors. The planning system consists of three layers, with each layer using a different planning mechanism.

Compulsory planning is limited to state-owned enterprises operating in strategic sectors, including research, education and infrastructure development plans. Compulsory planning outlines targeted outcomes and the supply of raw materials and financial resources needed. Contractual planning sets objectives and the overall means of achieving these goals and then negotiates with enterprises and local governments to establish detailed objectives and how resources are to be allocated to the targeted sectors. Indicative planning operates at the lowest level of the planning system, where the government outlines industrial targets and then uses market instruments (tax exemptions, subsidies and favorable bank loans) to induce firms in the targeted industry to meet these targets.

<text>The Maloti-Drakensberg Park is a World Heritage Site, established on 11 June 2001 by linking the Sehlabathebe National Park in the Kingdom of Lesotho and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The highest peak is Thaba Ntlenyana rising to 3,482 metres.

Proposed extensions to the main park include the Golden Gate Highlands National Park, Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve (Free State) and Royal Natal National Park (KwaZulu-Natal) in South Africa; and the Bokong Nature Reserve and Ts&#x27;ehlanyane National Park in Lesotho.

The park is situated in the Drakensberg Mountains which form the highest areas in the sub-region, and support unique montane and sub-alpine ecosystems. These ecosystems hold a globally significant plant and animal biodiversity, with unique habitats and high levels of endemism. The park is also home to the greatest gallery of rock art in the world with hundreds of sites and many thousands of images painted by the Bushmen (San people).

The Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development Area was conceived as a Peace park, covering about 8 113 km2, consisting of 5 170 km2 (64%) in Lesotho and 2 943 km2 (36%) in KwaZulu-Natal.

<text>The Euroradar Captor is a next-generation mechanical multi-mode pulse Doppler radar designed for the Eurofighter Typhoon. Development of Captor led to the Airborne Multirole Solid State Active Array Radar (AMSAR) project which eventually produced the CAESAR (Captor Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar), now known as Captor-E.

==Development==
=== Early development ===
In June 1985, discussions began amongst various concerns to sound out the possibility of cooperation for the EFA, the project that would later become the Eurofighter, radar. The United Kingdom chose Ferranti as the leading contract partner, Germany AEG-Telefunken and Italy FIAR. Spain, which had no radar experience, played only a minor role, later selecting Eesa as the main contractor. Towards the end of June 1985, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain to develop a joint radar for the EFA. France had already indicated at the time that it intended to withdraw from the programme. The French company Thomson-CSF was thus faced with a dilemma, as it would have liked to participate in an EFA radar. Therefore, in 1987, Thomson-CSF negotiated with Ferranti to secure a share of the work. Specifically, the travelling wave tube was to be supplied which was possibly the same one that was to be used in the Rafale. In March 1987, Ferranti and AEG sent their offers to Eurofighter GmbH.

Ferranti presented its ECR-90, based on the Blue Vixen, as early as 1986, while AEG offered the MSD-2000 &quot;Emerald&quot;, which was based on the AN/APG-65. Ferranti&#x27;s main argument was that a European fighter aircraft should also be equipped with a European radar. Ferranti had already been working with Thompson-CSF, Inisel and FIAR on the development of the radar since 1983. France withdrew with Thompson-CSF in June 1985, followed a year later by AEG. AEG wanted to offer a system based on the APG-65, as the company already had the production licence for this. There was still speculation as to whether Thorn-EMI would offer the AN/APG-68, but this did not end up happening. Both bidders submitted two-part offers: one that fully met the tender requirements and a reduced low-cost variant. Ferranti and FIAR offered the ECR-90 and the Super Vixen, AEG and GEC Marconi the MSD-2000 and the APG-65, but both high-tech offers were too expensive and the low-cost alternatives were deemed insufficient.

As a result, a new tender was launched. This time, the performance requirements were slimmed down and the manufacturers were also asked how the costs could be reduced. The requirements were also less stringent in order to fuel the inventive spirit of the engineers. The two new tenders were submitted in February 1988:

* ECR-90: The European Collaborative Radar 90 was offered by Ferranti in the variants -90, -90A and -90B. The detection range was always the same, only the capabilities were to be integrated bit by bit. The main argument was again that the radar would account for a significant proportion of the costs of the EFA, and thus a European in-house development would enable higher added value in Europe. To reduce risk, the ECR-90 was to be based on the Blue Vixen of the BAE Sea Harrier FA2, which was already AMRAAM-capable in order to send target updates to the missiles. For the Blue Vixen, two planar antenna designs were tested: one made of a light metal alloy and one formed from an aluminised carbon fibre plate; the latter was rejected due to the higher costs and uncertainty regarding durability. The choice was left open for the ECR-90. The antenna drive was based on the Blue Vixen and PS-05 of the Saab 39, and corrected pitch and roll movements with 0.5 hp samarium-cobalt motors. There was no roll control: roll angles were compensated electronically. The coupled-cavity travelling wave tube was to be supplied by Selenia or Thomson-CSF. The signal processing and processors were taken over from the Blue Vixen. Since the software development of Blue Vixen accounted for about 80% of the development costs, and about 50% of the software for the ECR-90 was to be taken over, savings opportunities were seen here. Blue Vixen only had 11 of the required 31 radar modes. The 32-bit signal processor, however, was to be twice as fast and supplied by Hughes, IBM or Ericsson. The Blue Vixen&#x27;s D80 achieved around 500 MIPS. The computing modules were housed in metal cassettes that acted as heat sinks and had air flowing through the centre. While the Blue Vixen consisted of 13,790 parts, the ECR-90 was to consist of only 13,000 parts.

* MSD-2000: The Multimode Silent Radar 2000 from AEG and GEC Marconi was based on the APG-65. This was a logical progression as the APG-65 had been planned for the EFA predecessor TKF-90, which is why the weight, volume and energy specifications of the EFA radar were also adopted from the TKF-90 program. Marconi also came to the conclusion that a new development would not be possible in the time available, which is why the APG-65 of the F-18 was accepted as the base model. The APG-65 already had 28 of the required 31 radar modes and the AMRAAM capability, meaning that 80% of the software could be adopted. A further 10% had to be reprogrammed and another 10% newly programmed. The additional programming related almost exclusively to the three missing modes &quot;Non-Cooperative Target Recognition&quot;, &quot;Visual Identification&quot; and &quot;Slaved air-to-air acquisition&quot;. In addition, the number of targets in TWS mode and the ECCM capability were to be improved. Compared to the APG-65, the antenna was to be enlarged from 68 cm to 75 cm and the radiation power doubled. The receiver sensitivity was to be increased, the antenna was to be equipped with D/F-band dipoles for a NATO IFF system, and the signal processor was to be replaced with a faster model from Marconi. New samarium-cobalt motors were planned for the antenna drive so as not to reduce the antenna speed. Although the transmitter power was to be doubled compared to the APG-65, the transmission power was always to be kept as low as possible to prevent detection. The number of plug-in cards was to be reduced from 21 to 7, but 25% of the computing and memory capacity was to remain free. The remaining 17 free slots would then be available for expansion. The radar processor was to be adopted from the AI.24 Foxhunter radar of the Tornado ADV, which was based on a 32-bit Motorola 68020, in order to double the computing power. In total, less than 15% of the radar would come from the US.

The radar software was to be programmed in Ada, as was the entire EFA software. The US was rather critical of the required technology transfer for the MSD-2000 when it was negotiated in May 1988, but nevertheless agreed to it in August of that year. The schedule now envisaged completing the first airworthy radars in 1992, as the first flight of the EFA was planned for 1991, and starting series production in 1996. Spain was now in favour of the MSD-2000, as the cost and timeframe seemed the most realistic. After October 1988, the decision was made, with Ferranti&#x27;s ECR-90 winning the race but not being chosen.

Since Germany did not agree with the decision, German Defence Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg met with British Defence Secretary Tom King in mid-1989. They agreed to commission a study into whether the MSD-2000 could be adapted to British requirements after all. At the same time, the UK Ministry of Defence launched a study into how the partner countries, excluding Germany, could develop their own radar for the EFA. The MSD-2000 study was negative, but Germany still refused to give in on this issue. As no agreement could be reached after 18 months, the UK and Germany called on the industry to find a solution. In December 1989, Ferranti held talks with Telefunken System Technik (formerly AEG until Daimler took over the company) to co-operate on the ECR-90 and resolve the German resistance. At the same time, the industry warned politicians of rising costs due to the delays. Eurofighter GmbH then sent letters to all four partner countries and NETMA stating that all additional costs would be passed on to them. This was important as the EFA radar was to be awarded as a fixed-price contract and the companies involved were to be reimbursed for the delays. At the beginning of 1990, GEC Marconi, which was working on the MSD-2000, swallowed up Ferranti, which was designing the ECR-90, a decision that was underwritten by the British government. Ferranti&#x27;s labs became the new GEC Ferranti in 1990, and then BAE Systems Avionics when GEC&#x27;s various military electronics divisions - Ferranti, Marconi and Elliott Brothers - were merged. Plessey, which manufactured the EFA&#x27;s missile detectors, was taken over by a consortium of GEC Marconi and Siemens. This signalled a relaxation on the radar front. In early 1990, GEC-Ferranti was finally declared the winner of the EFA radar competition and awarded a £300m contract. In mid-1990, GEC-Ferranti negotiated with Ericsson to remove the company from the ECR-90 Euroradar consortium and use the Motorola 68020 processors of the MSD-2000 instead. In a comparison, its signal processing proved to be significantly more powerful. This in turn was seen as a problem by Germany, as the redesign of the ECR-90 meant that delays and further cost increases were unavoidable.

Hughes sued GEC for $600 million for its role in the selection of the EFA and alleged that it used Hughes technology in the ECR-90 when it took over Ferranti. It later dropped this allegation and was awarded $23 million; the court judged that the MSD-2000 &quot;had a real or substantial chance of succeeding had GEC not [tortiously] intervened... and had the companies, which were bound by the Collaboration Agreement, faithfully and diligently performed their continuing obligations thereunder to press and promote the case for MSD-2000.&quot;

Since these events, further mergers have taken place in the industry. Parts of BAE Systems Avionics were merged with Galileo Avionica to form SELEX Galileo in 2005 which in turn then merged with other Finmeccanica defence electronics companies in 2013 to create Selex ES (merged in turn in Finmeccanica, rebranded Leonardo since 2017). The development effort is now organized under the Euroradar consortium, consisting primarily of Selex ES, as well as Airbus and Indra.

The ECR-90 was renamed CAPTOR when the project passed the production contract milestone.

===Captor-E AESA variant ===

In 1993 a European research project was launched to create the Airborne Multirole Solid State Active Array Radar (AMSAR); it was run by the British-French-German GTDAR (&quot;GEC-Thomson-DASA Airborne Radar&quot;) consortium (now Selex ES, Thales and Airbus respectively). This evolved into the CAESAR (Captor Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar), now known as Captor-E active electronically scanned array.

In May 2007, Eurofighter Development Aircraft 5 made the first flight with the a prototype of the Captor-E. The Captor-E is based on the Captor radar currently in service on Eurofighter production aircraft. The new generation of radar is intended to replace the mechanically steered antennas and high-power transmitters used on current Eurofighter aircraft with an electronically steered array. This enables new mission capabilities for combat aircraft such as simultaneous radar functionalities, air surveillance, air-to-ground and weapon control. The new radar improves the effective air-to-air missile range of the aircraft and allows for faster and more accurate detection and tracking of multiple aircraft with lower life cycle costs. In July 2010, it was reported that the Euroradar consortium made a formal offer to provide an AESA solution for the Eurofighter. The consortium plans to retain as much &quot;back-end&quot; equipment as possible while developing the new radar and also stated that the inclusion of an AESA radar was an important in securing orders from foreign nations.

On 19 November 2014, at the Edinburgh office of Selex ES, the European consortium Eurofighter GmbH and the inter-governmental agency NETMA (NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency) signed a contract worth €1 billion to develop the electronically scanned digital antenna array Captor-E radar for the Typhoon.

Characteristics of the antennas:

* Captor-M: Mechanically scanned antenna. Interface and integration of the radar to the aircraft by BAE Systems
* Captor-E ECRS Mk0: Interface and integration of the radar to the aircraft by BAE Systems. AESA antenna, the T/R modules are made with GaAs HEMT HPA (gallium arsenide High Electron Mobility Transistor High Power Amplifiers)
* Captor-E ECRS Mk1: Interface and integration of the radar to the aircraft by Airbus Germany. AESA antenna, the T/R modules are made with GaAs HEMT HPA (gallium arsenide High Electron Mobility Transistor High Power Amplifiers)
* Captor-E ECRS Mk2: Interface and integration of the radar to the aircraft by BAE Systems. AESA antenna, the T/R modules are made with GaAs and GaN HEMT HPA (gallium arsenide and gallium nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor High Power Amplifiers). This enables efficient multi-tasking of radar tracking use and electronic warfare simultaneously. It is installed on a pivot derived from the one used on the Gripen E with the Selex ES-05 Raven radar. The wider bandwidth meant that a new radome was needed.

== Technology ==

The CAPTOR was optimised for air combat with beyond visual range air-to-air missiles (BVRAAM) under strong enemy electronic countermeasures, resulting from the requirements of the Cold War. Since the end of the Cold War, the main focus of the Eurofighter has shifted from fighter to multi-role combat aircraft tasks. The ground attack capabilities of the radar were therefore further developed in this direction. The mechanical control system was selected in the initial phase of the Eurofighter project as the development risks were to be minimised. According to the project managers, the technology of a mechanically swivelled antenna were fully exploited in the CAPTOR.

The radar consists of a mechanically controlled antenna made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic with a diameter of . The antenna can be swivelled by ±60° in elevation and +-70° azimuth. Four high-precision samarium-cobalt servomotors with high torque are used to control the antenna in order to achieve high scanning speeds. The motors can only move the planar antenna in elevation and azimuth angles while roll angles are compensated electronically by combined control in order to reduce weight. Due to the very high scanning speed for a mechanically swivelled antenna, the radar can also interleave different radar modes, which would only otherwise be possible with phased array antennas, albeit much faster. For example, air-to-air and air-to-ground modes can be combined in one scan pass. The accuracy is less than one milliradian in alignment and less than in distance.

The CAPTOR operates in the X-band from 8 to 12 hertz (GHz) (horizontally polarised) and has twice the transmission power of the AN/APG-65. It automatically switches between low, medium and high pulse repetition rates. These range from 1,000 to 200,000 pulses per second, with the main focus on medium pulse repetition rates. Friend or foe detection (IFF) is integrated into the radar unit and is normally fully automatic. The signal processing consists of 61 plug-in cards (shop replaceable items-SRI) and 6 line replaceable units. The modular design allows for easy repairs and upgrades. The built-in self-diagnostic capability indicates the defective SRI, which can be read out on the ground by a laptop without having to switch on the power supply. If the SRI is actually defective, it is replaced. The software was written in Ada in accordance with the MIL STD 2167A standard. The CAPTOR is the first NATO radar with three processing channels. The first channel is used for target search, the second for target tracking and identification and the third for localisation, classification and overcoming jamming as well as sidelobe suppression. The entire system weighs and the computers are cooled with both liquid and air.

=== Signal processing ===
Due to the sensor fusion used in the Eurofighter Typhoon by means of the Attack and Identification System (AIS), the radar modes are normally selected automatically by the on-board computer; the CAPTOR is operated exclusively according to the VTAS principle (VTAS - Voice, Throttle and Stick). The general mode of operation of the radar is as follows: First, the radar transmits in &#x27;Velocity Search&#x27; (VS) mode to detect approaching targets even in ground clutter. If targets are detected, the radar switches to &#x27;range while search&#x27; (RWS) mode. The computer creates a track file and continues to work in &#x27;track while scan&#x27; (TWS) mode while searching for new targets. The identity of the targets is then determined by NIS or NCTI and the threats are prioritised. Further modes such as Raid Assessment and Threat Assessment are then applied if necessary. Further operating modes and capabilities are not listed in full:

* Synthetic Aperture Radar / Automatic Target Recognition: Older aircraft types also have a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode, but the pilot must search for targets himself, provided the resolution of the image is high enough. This function is automated in the CAPTOR-D/E. The high-resolution SAR image is first smoothed with a Gaussian filter to reduce details. Then the gradient and the direction of the gradient to the neighbouring pixel is determined starting from each pixel. If the magnitude of the gradient of a pixel in a certain direction is greater than that of the neighbouring pixel, the pixel is declared an edge, otherwise it is assigned to the background. Weak edges are eliminated by a hysteresis threshold (Canny algorithm). After another algorithm has generated closed structures, the invariant Fourier descriptors of the image are calculated and fed into an artificial neural network for automatic target identification. Here, several subnets run in parallel and the final result between the subnets is determined by voting. The positions of the detected targets are then marked on the SAR image with red diamonds and the target type is displayed in red text above the diamond, e.g. &quot;T-72&quot; or &quot;MLRS&quot; (multiple rocket launcher). The generated radar image is superimposed on a vectorised map with known Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates stored in the computer in order to calculate the GPS data of the targets. Alternatively, the GPS target position can be determined using the user&#x27;s own GPS position and different recording angles and distances. To train the neural network, EADS developed software in which computer-aided design (CAD) models of targets are placed on a map and the scene is converted into a SAR image. The algorithm then attempts to detect the targets despite interfering objects, different target angles and partial occlusion of the targets.

* Non Cooperative Target Identification: Radars have generally been capable of jet engine modulation (JEM) since the end of the 1980s, but this only works in the front of the aircraft as the turbine must be visible. The implementation of &#x27;High Range Resolution&#x27; (HRR) was planned for the next generation of fighter aircraft radars. As the name High Range Resolution suggests, the target is profiled along its length. For this purpose, a series of narrowband nanosecond pulses are emitted to achieve a high range resolution in the metre range. In addition to this standard method, it is also possible to transmit narrowband chirps with stepped carrier frequencies as a continuum. The former was already possible before 1987, the latter was newly developed by BAE Systems. The method used by CAPTOR is a secret, but it is probably the latter. The radar echo of the target then emits a characteristic frequency curve over time, as a pulse is first reflected by the nose, cockpit canopy, air intake, leading edges of the wings and vertical stabiliser (if the target is irradiated from the front). In general, a bandwidth of 400 MHz and a large number of measurements are considered necessary to identify airborne targets. Together with the track data of the target, which is required to determine the angle of the target to the radar, the characteristic frequency curve of the echo over time can be assigned to a target type by means of a database comparison. The pilot is then shown an abbreviation for the aircraft type on the display, e.g. &quot;Mrg3&quot; or &quot;Flkr&quot;. To prevent the size of the database from getting out of hand, only the aircraft type data that is expected to occur in the respective area is loaded for each mission. Since the outboard load configuration of the target is not known, there may be difficulties with non-cooperative target identification. In this case, hundreds of HRR profiles of the target are created in order to filter out the echoes of the external loads and calculate an ISAR image from them. However, this requires the target to move relative to the radar and the radar to remain on the target for a long time, which is tactically unfavourable. The ISAR image can presumably be shown to the pilot in &quot;Visual Identification&quot; mode on the displays, the resolution per pixel dot is lower than with PIRATE.

* Space-Time Adaptive Processing / Combat Search: This capability is at the heart of the CAPTOR-E. With Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP), slow-flying targets can also be recognised under the influence of clutter and interference radiation, even if their echo signal would otherwise be drowned out by interference signals. Several sub-apertures are used for this purpose, with which the wave field reflected from the ground is scanned with a time delay. Ideally, the signals in the individual channels only differ by this time offset. However, moving targets with a radial velocity component change their distance to the sensor within this period of time, so that the signals are subject to a phase shift and can be distinguished from the clutter signals. In the environment of the echo signal of a target, not only the temporal change is considered, but also compared with the spatial change (space-time). The principle is also used to detect slow ground targets in Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) mode. If an aerial target is lost in TWS mode, the suspected target area no longer has to be swivelled in a time-consuming manner with a signal lobe: The Combat Search mode generates multiple signal lobes that cover the target area in a chessboard-like manner within an angle range of 20° × 20°. Idealised, one pulse, sent and received by several signal lobes, is sufficient to find the lost target again.

* Jammer Mapping / Deterministic Nulling: The CAPTOR-E (according to rumours also the CAPTOR-M) is capable of jammer mapping. This uses spectral processing to determine the identity and angle of the jammer with a high degree of accuracy. The CAPTOR-E then starts with digital adaptive beamforming: as the directivity of an AESA antenna can be manipulated as required by controlling the transmit/receive (T/R) modules, zeros are set in the antenna pattern in the direction of the jammers. The key is to make the null points as narrow as possible so that targets next to interferers can be reliably recognised. During AMSAR flights, the signal strength of interference sources could be reduced to background noise so that targets reappeared. Deterministic nulling is used to improve the result. Here, the received signals of the T/R modules are weighted differently by the signal processor across all degrees of freedom of the antenna in order to further reduce the influence of interference.

* Low Probability of Intercept: In order to reduce the probability of detection by enemy radar detectors and electronic support measures, the CAPTOR-E will be equipped with an low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) radar operating mode. Few details are known about this; the radar will transmit with a wide main lobe and receive through multiple lobes with high antenna gain.

* Noise Jamming / High-Power Microwave: When used as a jammer, the radar transmits at full power in all frequencies simultaneously, focussing the radar energy on the enemy&#x27;s X-band antenna. This increases the background noise at the target radar, the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates and the range decreases. If the available effective radiated power (ERP) of their own antenna is high enough, additional signal lobes can be formed for airspace search, target tracking or interference. If the burn-through distance is undershot, the broadband noise becomes pointless. If the enemy is close enough to the CAPTOR-E, High-Power Microwave (HPM) mode comes into effect: the radar energy is focussed extremely strongly on the target and the transmission frequency, pulse repetition rate and signal pattern are adapted to the target. The energy penetrates the object via a front-door, usually the weapon&#x27;s seeker (IR or radar), or via feedback effects from the surface and openings (back-door). This creates an electromagnetic field inside, which - if suitable transmission parameters are selected - interferes with the weapon&#x27;s electronics. This leads to an increase in the bit error rate and, in the best case, to computer crashes. Possible applications include the deflection of enemy missiles and suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD). While the jammer function should be available as soon as possible with the introduction of the CAPTOR-E, its use as an energy weapon is not planned until later.

* High-Speed Datalink / Cyberattack: AESA antennas can also be used as directional radio antennas to transmit data at high data transmission rates. For example, the AN/APG-77 can transmit at 548 megabits per second and receive in the gigabit range. As the CAPTOR-E uses the same carrier frequency, similar speeds will be possible. The data transmission function should be available shortly after the CAPTOR-E is launched. Its use as a cyber weapon for injecting malware is only planned for later. The Suter, which was developed by BAE Systems to attack enemy computer networks and communication systems, means that the EuroRADAR consortium already has expertise and experience.

* Bistatic Radar / Space-Based Radar: The ability to exchange data packets between radars makes it possible to use two CAPTOR-Es as bistatic radars. Thanks to the inclined, rotatable antenna surface, the machines can fly on a parallel course while working together. One exotic possible application would be to use a satellite with an X-band AESA in orbit as a transmitter and utilise the CAPTOR-E as a passive radar. The principle was already demonstrated in November 2007 with the TerraSAR-X satellite. The successor system to SAR-Lupe, called SARah, is also to receive a satellite with AESA, which is based on TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. For example, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency&#x27;s (DERA) AESA radar prototype &#x27;Phased Array Concepts Evaluation Rig&#x27; (PACER), which was intended to support the development of the AMSAR, consisted only of passive X-band receiver modules and was intended to research bistatic applications, among other things.

<text>The Allstate Corporation is an American insurance company, headquartered in Glenview, Illinois (with a Northbrook, Illinois address) since 2022. Founded in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and Co., it was spun off in 1993, but was still partially owned by Sears until it became an independent company completely in June 1995. The company also has personal line insurance operations in Canada.

Allstate is a large corporation, and with 2018 revenues of $39.8 billion, it ranked 79th in the 2019 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Its long-running advertising campaign, in use since 1950, asks, &quot;Are you in good hands?&quot;, and the recognizable logo portrays a pair of human hands.

==History==
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After 2,253,746 name submissions from 937,886 participants, &quot;Allstate&quot; was chosen. Hans Simonson of Bismarck, North Dakota, received a $5,000 cash prize for his winning entry among a list of 31 he submitted. The trademark was officially registered on April 19, 1927, and the tires&#x27; new name made its debut in the spring 1927 Sears catalog. 

The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Robert E. Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and the proposal was sent to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears&#x27; tire line, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog. This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.

Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate&#x27;s first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.

In 1933, at the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, Allstate&#x27;s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.

In 1941, only about a quarter of US drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law that established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s, nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.

In 1949, the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3246 W. Arthington Street in Chicago as a part of the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The midrise building is vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early postwar midrise construction. This location was vacated when the company relocated in the postwar years.

The company&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re in Good Hands with Allstate&quot; slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate&#x27;s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company&#x27;s first network-television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.

Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964. (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)

In 1967, the company&#x27;s home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker&#x27;s-compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967, and a business package policy in 1969.

The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products such as fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The automobile was based on the Henry J car manufactured by Kaiser Motors. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s, before becoming insurance only in the mid-1970s.

In 1991, the company went public. In June 1993, 19.8% of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80% stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.

In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal-lines division of CNA Financial and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company.

In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate&#x27;s spokesman, using the tagline &quot;That’s Allstate’s stand.&quot;

In May 2011, Allstate announced that it was purchasing Esurance and rate-comparison site Answer Financial for about $1 billion.

In 2012, Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore; it is a technology and operations center to provide software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. 

In January 2017, Allstate acquired SquareTrade, a consumer electronics and appliance protection plan provider. The acquisition cost a reported $1.4 billion from a group of shareholders.

In July 2020, Allstate announced it was acquiring National General for $4 billion. The deal closed in January 2021.

In 2021 Allstate completed sale of its life insurance and annuity businesses. One of the divested businesses was Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York, which became part of Wilton Reassurance Life Company of New York. Another was the similarly named Allstate Life Insurance Company, purchased by Everlake Holdings and renamed Everlake Life Insurance Company. A third divested business was Allstate Assurance Co, also purchased by Everlake Holdings.

In 2025, Chief Information Officer Zulfi Jeevanjee spoke about Allstate&#x27;s use of AI to generate emails to customers that would sound less confusing and more understanding: &quot;When these emails used to go out, even though we had standards and so on, they would include a lot of insurance jargon. They weren’t very empathetic…Claims agents would get frustrated, and so it wasn’t necessarily great communication.&quot; He added, &quot;The claim agent still looks at them just to make sure they’re accurate, but they’re not writing them anymore.&quot; After Futurism reported on this, a spokesperson from Allstate&#x27;s media relations team contacted them demanding that they take down the blog post in question.

==Advertising==

===&quot;Good hands&quot;===
Allstate&#x27;s slogan &quot;You&#x27;re in good hands&quot; was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company&#x27;s sales executive, Davis W. Ellis, based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also refer to themselves as the &quot;Good Hands People&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate&#x27;s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.

This 1975 commercial that the egg rolls on the table, then it fell down and it almost cracked all the way down to the floor, but it was finally saved by the hand before placing it in the nest gently.

A study in 2000 by Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan &quot;You&#x27;re in good hands&quot; ranked as the most recognizable in America.

===Logo===
Allstate&#x27;s original hands logo was designed by Theodore Conterio in the 1950s. The employees were told whoever could come up with the best logo would win $50. Theodore Conterio came up with the design based on the slogan, &quot;You&#x27;re in good hands,&quot; and won the $50 prize.

===&quot;Allstate&#x27;s stand&quot;===

Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate&#x27;s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate&#x27;s service was superior to that from low-cost providers GEICO and Progressive. Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.

===Mayhem===

Mayhem was created by Leo Burnett Worldwide. Burnett pitched the character to Allstate as &quot;Mr. Mayhem&quot;, comparing him to the character Mr. White from the 1992 film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; played by Harvey Keitel.

Mayhem has been played by Dean Winters since the campaign was launched in April 2010. The character wears a black suit, white dress shirt, and black necktie and his face is usually bruised, scarred, or wearing a butterfly bandage.

The formula for almost every Mayhem commercial has been the same. To begin the commercial, Mayhem identifies the risk he is portraying. He gives context into the situation and hints at an impending disaster that he will cause, which then takes place. For instance, a 2015 ad features Mayhem playing a portable grill hastily loaded into a car before being fully extinguished, which leads to an explosion when the still-burning embers ignite an enormous bottle of lighter fluid. Once the disaster&#x27;s result is revealed, Mayhem warns that certain &quot;cut-rate&quot; policies lack coverage for the situation he has caused, advising the viewers to get their insurance policies through Allstate. Each commercial ends with Mayhem telling the viewers that by having Allstate, they will be &quot;better protected from mayhem...like me.&quot; Damage to his clothing and injuries to his person carry over from one commercial to the next.

In some ads, Mayhem also has advised against going without roadside assistance. In separate advertisements, he described what could happen in the face of a catastrophe while driving; these consisted of having to stay in a creepy roadside motel overnight because one&#x27;s car ran out of fuel, being forced to change a tire in a heavy downpour, being forced to stay at an awkward family gathering because one&#x27;s car battery died, and potentially becoming a victim of crime due to a breakdown in the wrong neighborhood.

A series of ads in early 2018 featured Mayhem with a New Year&#x27;s resolution to help keep people and property safe. He took the role of various pieces of safety equipment, such as a lightning rod mounted on a house&#x27;s roof to protect it during storms or a flare placed to warn drivers of a roadside vehicle breakdown. However, less than a month into the new year, he broke his resolution and returned to his old habit of causing chaos and damage.

Allstate developed the campaign &quot;Mayhem&quot; and the character (Mayhem) in response to being ranked fourth in advertising spending behind GEICO, State Farm, and Progressive. Allstate had an existing campaign called &quot;Our Stand&quot; featuring Dennis Haysbert that targeted &quot;older, more traditional customers&quot;, and the company sought to develop a campaign that would skew toward younger customers. Nina Abnee, executive vice president at Burnett, said &quot;We wanted to kick Flo&#x27;s ass.&quot; The campaign was first launched in mid-June 2010. The character was featured in TV and radio spots as well as on billboards and Internet banners. Some ads were adjusted to capture local details. By mid-2011, Allstate had won around 80 industry awards for the campaign.

There is a Hispanic version named La Mala Suerte (meaning Bad Luck) for the Spanish-speaking market portrayed by Alberto Mateo.

==Recognition==
&quot;Advertising Age&quot; reported in February 2011 that Mayhem rose to third as most-recognized insurance advertising character, behind the GEICO gecko and Flo from Progressive Insurance. An online survey showed that the GEICO gecko and Flo were each tied to their respective companies over 90% of the time. For Mayhem, the &quot;Age&quot; said, &quot;After the top two, the most-recognized ad description was Allstate, with 65% of consumers saying they knew the ad. When those same consumers were asked to associate it with a brand, 63% correctly matched Mayhem with Allstate. Overall, among the total sample, Mayhem clocked in with only 41% of respondents being able to link him to Allstate.

===Social media===
In January 2011, Allstate released &quot;The Lines&quot;, a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road safety in general. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

===Allstate Arena===

Allstate holds naming rights to the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois, near the company&#x27;s headquarters.

===College football===
Allstate sponsors branded field goal nets at over 67 colleges and universities. For each field goal and extra point kicked, Allstate donates into collegiate general scholarship funds. To date, those donations exceed $2.9 million. Allstate also sponsors branded nets during field goals and extra points at over 20 college bowl games, including the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the BCS National Championship Game.

Additionally, Allstate is a partner of the Southeastern Conference and its 20 sports, including football.

===Sugar Bowl===
Since 2007, Allstate has been the title sponsor of the Sugar Bowl, one of the four games that make up the Bowl Championship Series. The game is played at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which is also the home of the New Orleans Saints. Allstate is also a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints.

The 2012 Allstate BCS National Championship Game was played on January 9, 2012, and broadcast on ESPN.

===Allstate Wrigleyville Classic===
The Northwestern Wildcats and the Illinois Fighting Illini played a collegiate football game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010. It was the first football game at Wrigley Field since 1970 and the first collegiate football game at Wrigley Field since 1938 when DePaul University played its regular games at Wrigley. Allstate title sponsored this game.

===Allstate AFCA Good Works Team===
Allstate advertises through the American Football Coaches Association &quot;Good Works Team&quot; in which local Allstate agents surprise players with trophies in key Allstate marketing regions.

===Soccer===
In 2007, Allstate became a sponsor of the Mexico National Team, and in 2011 partnered with Major League Soccer and the United States Soccer Federation.

===NASCAR===
Allstate was a sponsor of the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard from 2005 to 2009 – the annual NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in late summer. Driver Kasey Kahne was featured in advertisements.

==Criticism==
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation&#x27;s worst insurers. This ranking was given because: &quot;While Allstate publicly touts its &#x27;good hands&#x27; approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a &#x27;boxing gloves&#x27; strategy against its policyholders,&quot; said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that &quot;The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no evidence for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law.&quot;

In 2009, Allstate successfully fought for federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.

===Auto insurance claims===
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN revealed that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly disputing auto insurance claims from individuals injured by their insured members. In 2010 Allstate commanded 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.

===Homeowners claims===
The PBS television program &quot;Now&quot;, in conjunction with &quot;Bloomberg Markets&quot; magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers&#x27; homeowners insurance policies.

===Catastrophe exposure management===
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, the company did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from not renewing policies.

On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.

===&quot;From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves&quot;===
&quot;From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves&quot; is a non-fiction work on the company written by David Berardinelli, Michael Freeman, and Aaron DeShaw with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson. The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey&#x27;s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its &quot;good hands&quot; in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out &quot;boxing gloves.&quot; According to a 2006 review in &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine, Allstate responded to Berardinelli&#x27;s allegations by claiming that Berardinelli&#x27;s allegations were &quot;unfounded and unproven.&quot; Legal decisions on the issues outlined in the book have led to varied outcomes in court. According to the &quot;Business Week&quot; article, &quot;Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial &#x27;Do I Need an Attorney?&#x27; form to people involved in accidents.&quot; On the other hand, the article also states that seven court rulings had rejected attacks on the practice. While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some were ended by legal and regulatory challenges.

===Use of Colossus===
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli&#x27;s book, involved the use of a software program called &quot;Colossus&quot; to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.

Filippo Buondelmonti degli Scolari (1369 – December 1426), known as Pippo Spano,{{Cref2|a}} was an Italian magnate, general, strategist and confidant of King Sigismund of Hungary, born in the Republic of Florence. The personal friend of Sigismund and member of the Order of the Dragon, he was buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica beside the Hungarian kings.

==Early career==
Filippo, the son of a destitute Florentine nobleman, was born at Tizzano, near Florence. He is first mentioned in Hungary around 1382, when he entered the service of Sigismund&#x27;s treasurer and was awarded the castle in Simontornya (&quot;Simonsthurm&quot;).

Further services to the Crown, such as providing resources to fight the Ottomans, led to his appointment as administrator of all gold mines in the kingdom. Present in Bosnia, in the context of a Hungarian nobles&#x27; rebellion and King Tvrtko I of Bosnia&#x27;s death (1391), Pippo managed to subdue the main leaders of the revolt.

He took part in the unfortunate anti-Ottoman final Crusade of September 1396 at Nicopolis in Bulgaria, and, unlike most on the Christian side, managed to flee after the defeat. He, the King, and a number of high dignitaries sailed a small boat up the Danube, all the way to Hungarian and Croatian lands.

He married Barbara, daughter and heir of Andrew of Ozora, in 1398.

During the new period of trouble with the claim to the throne of Charles II&#x27;s son Ladislaus of Naples, Lo Scolari exposed acts of treason on the part of some noblemen. He was however forced to give in to most of their demands, as the King was taken prisoner in Visegrád Castle (1401).

After Sigismund reasserted control briefly, the nobles openly recognized Ladislaus as King. The forces of the Kingdom of Naples took Zadar in 1403, and Pippo had to retreat; the same year, he regained Veszprém and, in September, took Esztergom and again raided Bosnia - breaking up contacts between Sicilian and rebel armies and forcing the invaders to flee. He persuaded the rebels to seek Sigismund&#x27;s pardon.

While in Vienna, Pippo was made Count of Temesvár (Timișoara). In this capacity, he initiated the building of the Hungarian border castle system to contain the Ottoman aggression; immediately, Pippo started confronting the Turks, but also moving against the Bosnian armies of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić that had been besieging the town of Šibenik in Dalmatia, regaining parts of today&#x27;s Croatia.

==In Italy==
In 1408, Pippo became the Ban of Szörény and member of the prestigious Order of the Dragon; by that time, he had become wealthy and powerful. In 1410, Sigismund sent him to persuade Italian city-states to cut off their links with Naples: he traveled in great pomp to his native Florence, then to Ferrara (meeting Niccolò III d&#x27;Este). In August, he was received by Pisan Antipope John XXIII. In September, present in Venice, Pippo is said to have backed a conspiracy.

As part of the anti-Venetian campaign of 1411, Lo Scolari entered Friuli at the head of an army, conquered Aquileia and, in December, he took Udine and several fortresses in Romagna, then Vittorio Veneto - capturing a high official from the Barbarigo family. In January 1412, the renewed attack ensured Pippo a supply of high-ranking Venetian prisoners, whom he ordered mutilated to avenge a Hungarian killed by the enemy.

He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Motta in August 1412 against the Venetian Republic under Carlo Malatesta. Pippo intended to besiege Padua in January, but he could not maintain his army on the spot, and moved towards the Brenta, in Cartigliano and Marostica, leading an unsuccessful attack on Vicenza. Further failures provoked his retreat to Friuli, and then to Hungary, in February. This outcome made Venetian accounts imply a settlement with the Most Serene Republic, and even the mythical execution of Pippo as revenge by the Emperor King (he supposedly had molten gold poured down his throat).

Lo Scolari returned to Friuli in September, in order to aid Florence against Ladislaus&#x27; troops. At Lodi (in Lombardy), he attended the meeting between Sigismund and the ruler of the city, Giovanni da Vignate.

==Later assignments==
Pippo took part in the March 1414 initial proceedings of the Council of Constance, where the Emperor King charged him with guarding John XXIII - an assignment he did not fully accomplish, as the Antipope soon managed to flee. In 1415, the Count of Temesvár witnessed the rebel Jan Hus&#x27; execution in Konstanz.

He fought the Turks again in 1417 in Wallachia, in 1418 around Belgrade, and in 1419 in Bosnia (where he agreed to a five-year truce); the King Emperor awarded him Severin, Mehadia and Orşova. He was called to Bohemia, where he dealt with the Hussite insurrection from 1420 (see Battle of Vítkov Hill), being severely beaten by Jan Žižka at Havlíčkův Brod (see Battle of Německý Brod), in January 1422.

The rumor that Pippo had been killed in Bohemia led to an Ottoman attack in Wallachia against his ally Prince Dan II. Prompted by requests from Stefan Lazarević, he moved into Serbia and won a large-scale battle. In 1425 Scolari, Dan II and the Bulgarian prince Frujin Asen crossed the Danube and defeated the Ottomans near Vetren and captured Silistra. However, he suffered a stroke the next year and was carried to Lipova where he died. He was buried in Székesfehérvár, next to the tombs of the Hungarian kings, his funeral being attended by King Sigismund in person.

==Legacy==
He was enumerated in South Slavic epic poetry, known as &quot;Filip the Magyar (Hungarian)&quot; ({{langx|sr|Филип Мађарин}}, {{langx|bg|Филип Маджарин}}).

<doc id="797067" wikidata="Q5475046" url="?curid=797067" title="Four Bucketeers">
<text>The Four Bucketeers were an ad hoc music/water-throwing group from the ITV children&#x27;s programme &quot;Tiswas&quot;.

Officially, the Four were Chris Tarrant, Sally James, John Gorman and Bob Carolgees; sometimes Lenny Henry contributed as well. Gorman was the musical talent in the group, having been part of The Scaffold and the Grimms. The musicians backing them up included Ollie Halsall (guitar), John Halsey (drums) and Clive Griffiths (bass).

The Four Bucketeers&#x27; best-known number (and also their highest-charting single) was &quot;The Bucket Of Water Song&quot;, which reached No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980.

Originally the song was composed and performed as a sketch within the &quot;Tiswas&quot; programme. According to Sally James, &quot;John came in one day and he said ‘I’ve sort of got this idea’. It’s a march basically, and we all sing this song. And it’s another excuse to chuck buckets of water! So obviously we didn’t do it in the studio. We had this little area outside the back of the studio where a camera would sort of poke out of the window, so we ended the show down there marching about, sploshing all this water from the buckets. And then the next week it was incredible, because the people were jamming the switchboard, ‘I’ve got to have this record!’. There was never any idea that it would be a record, but of course we did quickly make a record and it became a hit. It just all happened so left-of-field and so unplanned…but then that’s how a lot of things did happen in &quot;Tiswas&quot;. Things that you think would work, don’t, and things that you ‘Oh that’ll be good for a one-off’ end up being huge hits&quot;.

The moniker &#x27;The Four Bucketeers&#x27; came about as a way of circumnavigating any potential copyright difficulties of using the &#x27;Tiswas&#x27; brand when Tarrant and Co. performed the song outside of the TV show situation, and the initial record release. Ultimately though, a compromise was reached and thereafter, the phrase &#x27;Tiswas presents The Four Bucketeers&#x27; was used.

The aquatic theme was carried through into a less successful follow-up single, the anthemic waltz-time &quot;Water Is Wonderful&quot;, which eulogised:
:&#x27;Water is wonderful, water&#x27;s superb
:&#x27;Water&#x27;s too powerful to conquer or curb
:&#x27;Water&#x27;s at its best when you can chuck it
:&#x27;Over yourself from out of a bucket.&#x27;

An album, entitled &quot;Tiswas Presents The Four Bucketeers&quot;, was also released. This included both singles (albeit a different version of &quot;Water Is Wonderful&quot;) together with other skits from the television series. Contrary to the impression given by the singles, these were not all concerned with pailborne aquatic antics. All of The Four Bucketeers&#x27; records were produced by Neil Innes.

A third single was released from the album featuring Matthew Butler (the 6 year old who dressed as a rabbit) singing &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;.

<text>José Arce (15 October 1881 – 27 July 1968) was an Argentine physician, politician and diplomat. He held the position of the President of the United Nations General Assembly during the Second special session of the United Nations General Assembly - between 16 April 1948 and 21 September 1948.

Arce was born at the &quot;Estancia&quot; &#x27;La Independencia&#x27; in Lobería and was baptised at Balcarce (full name Marcos Jose Arce). At just fifteen he began studying at the Medicine Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires, from which he graduated as a doctor in 1903 with the gold medal for his class. He became a surgeon and professor of Anatomy at the University at just 25 years old. He also was professor of Surgery and represented the country in 1907 at the Latin American Medical Congress in Montevideo.

In 1909, Arce entered politics, becoming a city legislator of Buenos Aires until 1913, serving as chairman in 1912. Continuing his medical career, he was President of the Medical Society of Argentina in 1911. In 1913, Arce was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, serving from 1913 to 1920, 1924 to 1928 and 1934 to 1938, representing Buenos Aires Province. He proposed the law creating the Faculty of Economics of UBA. He was Rector of UBA from 1922 to 1926. In 1926, now President of the Chamber of Deputies, he moved the law that created the current building for the Faculty of Medicine.

In 1945, Arce became Ambassador to Shanghai, and he was the Permanent Representative of Argentina to the UN for the period 1946-1949, during which time Argentina was a member of the Security Council 1948-49 and Arce was the President of the 1948 Special Session held in Paris, regarding the situation in Palestine. As a postage stamp collector Arce proposed that the United Nations should also issue them, an idea that was followed through in 1951 when the United Nations Postal Administration was created.

During the government of Juan Perón, he left for exile in Madrid and the United States. He wrote several books including a three-volume autobiography, a book dedicated to Francisco Franco and a manifesto for the return of the Falkland Islands to Argentine control.

Arce had one daughter, who died aged 14 in Paris in 1922. Some days later, he donated his books to the faculty library which was named &#x27;María Antonieta Arce&#x27; in his daughter&#x27;s memory. He donated his house in Buenos Aires to become a museum dedicated to President Julio Roca. He received many honours from universities and governments across the world.

<doc id="797083" wikidata="Q435766" url="?curid=797083" title="Friedrich Benjamin von Lütke">
<text>Friedrich Benjamin Graf von Lütke (, Fyodor Petrovich Litke; – ), more commonly known by his Russian name Fyodor Litke, was a Russian navigator, geographer, and Arctic explorer. He became a count in 1866, and an admiral in 1855. He was a corresponding member (1829), Honorable Member (1855), and President (1864) of the Russian Academy of Science in St. Petersburg. He was also an Honorable Member of many other Russian and foreign scientific establishments, and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Science in Paris.

==Biography==
Friedrich came from the Lütke family of Brandenburgish origin and originated in Jüterbog. Count Lütke&#x27;s grandfather was Johann Philipp von Lütke, a German Lutheran preacher and writer on physical science and theology. In 1745, Johann went from Germany to Moscow as pastor of a Lutheran parish in order to spread Lutheranism in the Russian Empire. As a youth, Friedrich attended a Lutheran German-speaking school. He remained a practicing Lutheran.

Lütke started his naval career in the Imperial Russian Navy in 1813. He took part in Vasily Golovnin&#x27;s world cruise on the ship &quot;Kamchatka&quot; from 1817 to 1819, where one of his crewmates was Ferdinand Wrangel. Then from 1821 to 1824, Lütke led the expedition to explore the coastline of Novaya Zemlya, the White Sea, and the eastern parts of the Barents Sea. From August 20, 1826, to August 25, 1829, he headed the world cruise on the &quot;Senyavin&quot;, sailing from Kronstadt and rounding Cape Horn. At the beginning, he was accompanied from Copenhagen and the Baltic Sea by Capt. Mikhail Nikolaievich Staniukovich who was in command of the sloop &quot;Möller&quot;. The scientific team included Heinrich von Kittlitz (ornithologist), Karl Heinrich Mertens (botanist) and Alexander Postels (mineralogist).

During this voyage he described the western coastline of the Bering Sea, the Bonin Islands off Japan, and the Carolines, although he discovered only one new island (Eauripik, the expedition is noted for having visited every inhabited island in the Caroline Islands (with the exception of Yap) and for compiling an extensive ethnographic account. In particular, the expedition spent three weeks in the Nomoi Islands, which had been last visited by Pedro Quiros in 1565. The team collected over 8000 plant, animal and mineral samples.

In 1835, Lütke was appointed by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia as tutor of his second son, Grand Duke Constantine Nicholaievich of Russia. Lütke was the first one to come up with the idea of a recording tide measurer (1839). They were built and installed along the coastlines of the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean in 1841. Lütke was one of the organizers of the Russian Geographical Society and its president in 1845–1850 and 1857–1872. He was appointed Chairman of the Naval Scientific Committee in 1846. Lütke was a commander-in-chief and a military governor of the ports of Reval (today&#x27;s Tallinn) and later Kronstadt in 1850–1857. In 1855, Litke became a member of the Russian State Council (&quot;Государственный совет&quot; in Russian; a legislative entity that predated the Duma, which came into existence only in 1906).

In 1873, the Russian Geographical Society introduced the Lütke gold medal. A cape, peninsula, mountain and bay in Novaya Zemlya, as well as a group of islands in Franz Josef Land, Baydaratskaya Bay, and the Nordenskiöld Archipelago and a strait between Kamchatka and Karaginsky Island, as well as two Russian icebreakers were named after him.

&quot;Nereocystis luetkeana&quot; was named after him by Mertens (first as &quot;Fucus luetkeanus&quot;) and then described by Postels and Ruprecht.

Ships named after Lütke include 1909-built icebreaker, 1970-built icebreaker, and 2017-built Yamalmax LNG carrier.

==Lütke&#x27;s contribution to the geography of Alaska==
During his voyage round the world on the Russian corvette &quot;Seniavin&quot; Lütke arrived at Sitka in 1827. From there he sailed to Unalaska, surveying the Pribilof Islands, St. Matthew Island and the Commander Islands, before arriving to Petropavlovsk, a harbor which he used as a base for further surveys along the Siberian coast all the way to St. Lawrence Bay by the Bering Strait.

After finally returning to Kronstadt Litke published a 3-volume account of his explorations with atlases in Russian and in French, the latter being published in Paris and entitled &quot;Voyage autour du monde, : exécuté par ordre de sa majesté l’empereur Nicolas Ier, sur la corvette Le Séniavine, dans les années 1826, 1827, 1828 et 1829, par Frédéric Lutké, ... commandant de l’expédition. Partie historique, avec un atlas, litographié d’après les dessins originaux d’Alexandre Postels et du baron Kittlitz. Traduit du russe sur le manuscrit original, sous les yeux de l’auteur, par le conseiller d’état F. Boyé. Tome I–III&quot;. Very few copies were printed and especially the Russian original work with its nautical part became an extremely rare item.

The nautical volume contains hydrographic and geographic details on the then little-known Bering Sea and Alaska obtained not only from Lütke&#x27;s own work but also from various previously unpublished Russian sources. Even though there were errors and delays in the publication that didn&#x27;t satisfy the author, Lütke&#x27;s work is a valuable source of information on the evolution of geographic knowledge of Alaska and the Bering Sea. When W. H. Dall published an index for the book, Lütke&#x27;s name was given as &quot;Lutke&quot;, which reflects the spelling under which the book was published in Paris.

Certain geographic features of the Alaskan coast, like the Walrus and Kritskoi Islands, Kudobin Islands and numerous other features in the Aleutians, were named by Count Lütke in the maps that were subsequently published.
The landhead now named Cape Lutke in Alaska was named after this Russian explorer by the Imperial Russian Hydrographic Service in 1847. The Litke Deep is named in his honour.

<text>Knox Grammar School is an independent Uniting Church day and boarding school for boys, located in Wahroonga, New South Wales, an Upper North Shore suburb of Sydney, Australia. Founded in 1924 by the Presbyterian Church of Australia as an all-boys school, and named after John Knox. The school has since grown, branching out into a large Senior School and a Preparatory School, enrolling approximately 2900 students. The school also caters for approximately 160 boarding students from Years 7 to 12.

Knox is affiliated with the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association (ABSA), and is a founding member of the Combined Associated Schools (CAS).
==History==
Knox Grammar School was established on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore in 1924, by the Presbyterian Church. The school was named after John Knox, the 16th century Scottish reformer, who planned a network of schools in every church parish. 

Knox opened as a Presbyterian Boys&#x27; School after founding members John Gilmore, William McIlrath, Robert Gillespie and Andrew Reid purchased the original property, &#x27;Earlston&#x27;, as the first school building. Now the Gillespie Heritage House, &#x27;Earlston&#x27; was previously owned by Sir Charles Mackellar, was designed by architects Spain &amp; Cosh, and built in 1908 for W. Moses Esq., Warrawee.

The school was officially opened by the Hon. Sir George Fuller KCMG, Premier of New South Wales, on 5 February 1924. Under the founding headmaster Neil MacNeil, a Rhodes Scholar, Knox grew rapidly and survived the Great Depression. Student numbers rose from 28 in 1924 to over 300 in 1939.

In 1939, William Bryden FRSE (1904–1992) took over the role of headmaster. As World War II broke out, around 370 Old Knox Grammarians served in the armed forces. 53 of them lost their lives and are now commemorated in the John Williams Memorial Hall, the School Chapel, the Old Students&#x27; War Memorial, and the original Science Building. The school&#x27;s Pipe Band was established during Bryden&#x27;s period as headmaster.
John Mill Couper, a Scot, became headmaster in 1953. Couper focused on broadening the School&#x27;s education, with attention to music and art, however, problems culminated in Couper&#x27;s departure from a divided Knox in 1955.

T. Ross McKenzie, former head of Brisbane Boys&#x27; College, replaced Couper. The school&#x27;s fifth headmaster, Ian Paterson, initiated further developments including a substantial building program. During this period three teachers sexually abused students; these teachers were later convicted and it has been alleged that other teachers abused students. In 2015 Paterson told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that he had failed to protect students from abuse.

In 2018, Scott James, who was formerly the deputy headmaster became Knox&#x27;s eighth headmaster, replacing John Weeks.

===Headmasters===
==Motto==
Knox&#x27;s school motto is a Latin phrase, &quot;&quot;, which has been translated variously as being &quot;Do the Manly Thing&quot; (The translation most common in the Preparatory School), &quot;The manly thing is being done&quot;.

==Campus==

There are several locations throughout Sydney with the main campus at Wahroonga. The smallest campus is Wahroonga Preparatory School, a small co-ed school located next to Wahroonga Park.

Knox owns several major sporting fields including one on campus at the Senior School, two on campus at the Prep School, and two off campus in Warrawee and neighbouring North Turramurra.

Since 2006 the school has been actively involved in the Future Problem Solving Program.

===Building projects===
Knox has in recent years completed new buildings at both the Senior and Prep Schools. The Senior School&#x27;s KG1 Building opened in 2007. The KG1 Project The Prep School&#x27;s K-2 Centre, opened in 2004, provided new classroom, library, art and music facilities for Years K-2 students.

The new Boarding Centre was finished in September 2010. The Great Hall and Aquatic Centre project, was finished in August 2011 and won design awards in 2012.

Construction for the new Knox Senior Student Academy began in 2014, with construction continuing to August 2015 and the academy being officially opened in October 2015. The building houses the lockers of Year 11 and Year 12 students, as well as featuring a cafe, classrooms for Science as well as Finance and Legal classrooms, a Senior Library and a Lecture theatre.

In 2016, Headmaster John Weeks announced that Knox Grammar School would commence construction of a new Performing Arts Centre and Junior Secondary Academy in February 2017. It was completed in early 2019.

The Senior School&#x27;s construction for a new locker area for Years 7-10 as well as a basketball court, which is in the process of refurbishing the KG1 Building for the new Middle Academy, was completed in early 2020.

== Controversies ==

=== Sex offences by teachers ===
The school attracted widespread media coverage in 2009, when criminal charges were laid against five former teachers for alleged sex offences between 1976 and 1990. All five teachers were subsequently convicted.

==== Royal Commission hearings ====
In 2015 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse conducted public hearings concerning the response of Knox Grammar, and the Uniting Church, to complaints and criminal proceedings involving teachers who sexually abused students. The commission will examine the &quot;systems, policies and procedures&quot; involving the school&#x27;s response to the complaints since 1970 and the experiences of former students sexually abused by teaching staff. The royal commission is expected to conclude in December 2017.

During hearings in early March 2015, several former Knox students and staff alleged that headmaster Ian Paterson did not refer several allegations of sex abuse he received to the police, despite there being a requirement for such allegations to be reported from 1988. The commission heard that in fact Paterson had never reported any student&#x27;s allegation of sexual abuse to police during his thirty years in charge of the school. Paterson also stated that he had allowed several teachers accused of sexual abuse to resign and subsequently gave them positive references. Paterson denied that he had covered up the sexual abuse of students, arguing that he had responded to the allegations brought to his attention, and stated that &quot;I should have known and I should have stopped the events that led to the abuse and its tragic consequences for these boys in my care and their families&quot;. Paterson stated that he was not aware that it was a crime for a teacher to grope or sexually proposition a student. Following the section of the hearing concerning Paterson, the then headmaster, John Weeks, stated that the school had changed considerably since the end of Paterson&#x27;s period in the role and that Knox&#x27;s Paterson Centre for Ethics and Business Studies would be renamed. He also stated that the school was actively reaching out and providing support to those who were affected.

Weeks also gave evidence to the Royal Commission. During this hearing he was questioned over why he had not sacked the teacher who was arrested in 2009 despite having received allegations in 2007 that the teacher had behaved improperly with a student during the 1980s. Weeks told the media that the allegations had not been detailed or specific, and he had received advice that &quot;it would have been difficult on industrial grounds&quot; to have dismissed the teacher. Weeks also stated that he had reported the teacher to the police child protection unit.

The Royal Commission issued its findings on Knox Grammar in September 2016. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that its conclusions were that &quot;Paterson deliberately covered up allegations about child sexual abuse because he placed the reputation of the school ahead of student welfare&quot;. The Royal Commission also found that principal Ian Paterson had a &quot;dismissive&quot; attitude towards complaints of sexual abuse, &quot;deliberately withheld information&quot; from a police officer investigating allegations made against Knox Grammar staff and did not notify the school&#x27;s council or affected parents of complaints. In addition, it judged that a statement made as part of his evidence to the Royal Commission that he had only been aware of a single allegation of misconduct while principal was &quot;clearly incorrect&quot;, as he had been aware of five allegations.

The Royal Commission recommended the establishment of a National Redress Scheme, which commenced on 1 July 2018. Knox Grammar School has not signed up to compensate its sexual abuse survivors through the National Redress Scheme, though it indicated it plans to do so.

==== 2019 incident ====
On 5 August 2019, Nicholas Warby, the school&#x27;s 30-year-old &quot;Director of Aquatic Sports&quot;, was arrested for possession of &quot;child abuse material&quot; on his mobile phone. After police searched his belongings and premises, two additional counts of possession of a prohibited drug were added. Headmaster Scott James sent a letter to parents, saying that Warby had been &quot;removed from his duties at the aquatic centre&quot; and that &quot;[the police] have advised us that there is currently no suggestion that the images relate to Knox boys or swim centre students.&quot; The police prosecutor told the court that some files were &quot;physically obtained&quot; rather than sourced from the internet. Warby was later convicted and sentenced to 14 months imprisonment.

==== 2024 incident ====
On 30 August 2024, William Gulson, an English teacher at the school and a former Year 7 Mentor, was arrested and charged with one count of procuring or grooming a child under 16 for unlawful sexual activity. On 6 September 2024, Knox&#x27;s headmaster Scott James sent a letter to parents informing them of the event. In the letter, it was claimed that &quot;there is no evidence that this behaviour extended beyond the online environment.&quot; Gulson&#x27;s employment was immediately terminated by Knox Grammar after his acts were made known to the school.

William Gulson has been granted conditional bail under the circumstances that he is not to enter the premises of Knox Grammar or come in contact with anybody under the age of 18. During the court hearing, the prosecutor told the court that allegedly upon being told by the child that they were 15, Gulson allegedly replied: &quot;Sorry dude, I feel super conflicted…do you find it hot that you are as old as some of my students?&quot;

The case name for this incident is &quot;R v William Roberto Gulson.&quot; Gulson is currently appeared at Hornsby Local Court at 9:30am on 25 Sept 2024. Gulson has pled not guilty and was granted bail. He is scheduled to reappear on 18 December 2024.

=== Discord Incident ===
In September 2022, 150 students (majorly Year 9 Knox students, with some girls and boys from other schools being involved) were found to have been participating in a Discord chatroom titled &#x27;Gang Gang&#x27; in which multiple racist, anti-semitic, misogynistic, homophobic, extreme anti-abortion messages and more had been sent. It was confirmed that no child abuse material was sent on the server. It was found that the chat was active for about two years, with the school becoming aware of it in August 2022 (in which it was discussed with parents, and where student withdrawals from the chat first began). Material from the group chat was provided to the NSW Police Force, and Knox&#x27;s principal Scott James responded to the incident in a letter to parents, labelling the messages by students &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;contrary to the values and culture of Knox&quot;. The letter confirmed that students involved were either suspended or left the school, punishment decided on how much the student participated in the chat. Twenty students in the chatroom met Knox&#x27;s requirements for disciplinary action.

<doc id="797094" wikidata="Q837811" url="?curid=797094" title="Seven Grievances">
<text>The Seven Grievances (Manchu: &quot;nadan koro&quot;; ) was a manifesto announced by Nurhaci, khan of the Later Jin, on the thirteenth day of the fourth lunar month in the third year of the &quot;Tianming&quot; () era of his reign; 7 May 1618. It effectively declared war against the Ming dynasty.

There were several accounts of the Seven Grievances, one from the &quot;Veritable Records of the Manchus&quot;, another from the &quot;Qing Veritable Records&quot;, and the one from Nurhaci&#x27;s successor Hong Taiji. According to the last account, the seven grievances are:
# The Ming killed Nurhaci&#x27;s father and grandfather without reason;
# The Ming suppressed Jianzhou and favored Yehe and Hada clans;
# The Ming violated agreement of territories with Nurhaci;
# The Ming sent troops to protect Yehe against Jianzhou;
# The Ming supported Yehe to break its promise to Nurhaci;
# The Ming forced Nurhaci to give up the lands in Chaihe, Sancha, and Fuan;
# The Ming&#x27;s official Shang Bozhi abused his power and rode roughshod over the people.

Shortly after the announcement of the &quot;Seven Grievances&quot;, the attack against the Ming on Fushun started. Han defectors played a very important role in the Qing conquest of Ming China. Han Chinese generals who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were often given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang () after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618. The offspring of Li received the &quot;Third Class Viscount&quot; () title. In retaliation, a year later, a Ming punitive force of about 100,000 men, which included Korean and Yehe troops, approached Nurhaci&#x27;s Manchus along four different routes. The Manchus scored successive victories, the most decisive being the battle of Sarhu in which Nurhaci defeated Ming dynasty and Korean troops that were far superior in numbers and armaments.

The Ming dynasty was wearied by a combination of internal strife and constant harassment by the Manchu. On May 26, 1644, Beijing fell to a peasant rebel army led by Li Zicheng. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor Zhu Youjian hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City. The Manchus then allied with Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li Zicheng&#x27;s short-lived Shun dynasty, establishing the Qing dynasty rule in China.

<text>Therese Ann Rutherford (November 2, 1917 – June 11, 2012) was a Canadian-born American actress in film, radio, and television. She had a long career starring and co-starring in films, playing Polly Benedict during the 1930s and 1940s in the Andy Hardy series, and appearing as one of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s sisters, Careen O&#x27;Hara in the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939).

==Early life==
Rutherford was born on November 2, 1917, in Vancouver, British Columbia to John Rutherford and Lucille (née Mansfield; 1890–1981) Rutherford. Rutherford&#x27;s mother was a silent film actress, and her father was a former operatic tenor. While Rutherford was still a baby, the family moved to San Francisco. Soon afterwards, her parents separated and Lucille Mansfield moved to Los Angeles, with Ann and her sister Laurette, who later became known as Judith Arlen.

While roller skating home from middle school in Hollywood, Rutherford would stop at some of the radio studios to listen to voice actors perform. After being criticized one day by her English teacher, Rutherford decided to show her up. She falsified an acting history and applied for work at radio station KFAC. A month later, Rutherford had a part in a radio serial drama.

== Career ==

===Film career===
In 1935, Rutherford began her Hollywood film career in the starring role of Joan O&#x27;Brien in the dramatic film &quot;Waterfront Lady&quot; for Mascot Pictures, later to be Republic Pictures. Rutherford soon established herself as a popular leading lady of Western films at Republic, costarring with actors Gene Autry and John Wayne.

In 1937, Rutherford left Republic and signed a film contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At MGM, Rutherford appeared as the Spirit of Christmas Past in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1938) and Lydia Bennet in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940) among other roles.

In 1938, MGM loaned Rutherford to Selznick International Pictures to appear as Careen O&#x27;Hara, a sister of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, in the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). MGM boss Louis Mayer initially refused the loan because he considered the role too minor, but Rutherford passionately appealed to him to change his mind. In December 1939, while promoting the new movie, Rutherford visited six Confederate Army veterans at the Confederate Soldiers Home near Atlanta. One of the veterans gave Rutherford a rose corsage tied with Confederate colors.

From 1937 until 1942, Rutherford portrayed Polly Benedict in the MGM Andy Hardy youth comedy film series starring Mickey Rooney. Her first film in this series was &quot;You&#x27;re Only Young Once&quot; (1937) and the last was &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Double Life&quot; (1942). Rutherford&#x27;s performances as Andy Hardy&#x27;s sweet and patient girlfriend established her screen popularity.

Rutherford also played Carol Lambert, comedian Red Skelton&#x27;s screen girlfriend, for MGM in a series of mystery/comedies: &quot;Whistling in the Dark&quot; (1941), &quot;Whistling in Dixie&quot; (1942), and &quot;Whistling in Brooklyn&quot; (1943).

In the early 1940s, Rutherford left MGM to freelance with different studios. During this period, she appeared in films such as &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; (1942) with 20th Century Fox, &quot;Two O&#x27;Clock Courage&quot; (1945) with RKO Radio Pictures, and &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947), also with RKO. In 1950, Rutherford retired from films. Despite Mickey Rooney&#x27;s pleas, she declined to as Polly Benedict in the final Andy Hardy film, &quot;Andy Hardy Comes Home&quot; (1958), stating that she didn&#x27;t believe most people married their first sweethearts and that Andy Hardy becoming a judge was implausible. In 1972, Rutherford returned to MGM for a small part in &quot;They Only Kill Their Masters&quot;, the last major film to be shot on the MGM backlot before it was razed and sold to developers. Rutherford&#x27;s final film appearance was a cameo role in &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976).

==Personal life and death==
Rutherford was married twice. On December 31, 1942, she married David May II, the grandson of the founder of the May Company department stores; the couple had a daughter. On June 6, 1953, Rutherford and May were divorced in Juárez, Mexico. On October 7, 1953, in New York City, Rutherford married actor/producer William Dozier, the creator of the &quot;Batman&quot; (1966–1968) TV series. Dozier died in Santa Monica, California, of a stroke on April 23, 1991. 

Rutherford died on June 11, 2012, aged 94 at her home in Beverly Hills, California, following declining health due to heart problems. She was cremated and her ashes given to her daughter. Her companion of twenty years was Al Morley.

<text>Potrace () is cross-platform, open-source software which converts bitmapped images into vector graphics. It is written and maintained by Peter Selinger.

== Properties ==
Various graphical frontends are available for the command-line application Potrace. Notably, it has been integrated with Inkscape, giving Inkscape its &quot;Trace Bitmap&quot; action. FontForge can use Potrace to import a bitmap image into a font. Potrace is also used by the music engraving program LilyPond. An open-source progressive web app that uses Potrace is SVGcode.

Potrace&#x27;s input and output is black and white (colored images are greyscaled before processing). However, Inkscape is capable of producing color images by decomposing each channel into several black and white images and tracing them separately with Potrace. The commercial Total Vectorize program also uses Potrace as its core.

Potrace is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later. A non-GPL version of Potrace called &quot;Potrace Professional&quot; is available under license from Selinger&#x27;s company, Icosasoft Software, Inc.

<doc id="797113" wikidata="Q111993" url="?curid=797113" title="Count Claude Florimond de Mercy">
<text>Count Claudius Florimund [[de Mercy]] (1666 – 29 June 1734) was an Imperial field marshal, born at Longwy in Lorraine, now in France. His grandfather was the Bavarian field marshal Franz Freiherr von Mercy.

Mercy entered the Austrian army as a volunteer in 1682. He won his commission at the great Battle of Vienna in the following year; and during seven years of campaigning in Hungary rose to the rank of Rittmeister. A wound sustained at this time permanently injured his sight. For five years more, up to 1697, he was employed in the Italian campaigns, then he was called back to Hungary by Prince Eugene of Savoy and won on the field of the Battle of Zenta two grades of promotion.

De Mercy displayed great daring in the first campaigns of the Spanish Succession War in Italy, twice fell into the hands of the enemy in rights at close quarters and for his conduct at the surprise of Cremona (31 January 1702) received the thanks of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and the proprietary colonelcy of a newly raised cuirassier regiment. With this he took part in the Rhine campaign of 1703, and the Battle of Friedlingen, and his success as an intrepid leader of raids and forays became well known to friend and foe. He was on that account selected early in 1704 to harry the dominions of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. He was soon afterwards promoted to &quot;Generalfeldwachtmeister&quot;, in which rank he was engaged in the Battle of Schellenberg (2 July 1704).

In the rest of the war he was often distinguished by his fiery courage. He rose to be general of the cavalry in the course of these ten years. His resolute leadership was conspicuous at the Battle of Peterwardein (1716) and he was soon afterwards made commander of the Banat of Temesvár.

At the great Battle of Belgrade (1717) he led the second line of left wing cavalry in a brilliant and decisive charge which drove the forces of the Ottoman Empire to their trenches. After the peace he resumed the administration of the Banat, which after more than 150 years of Turkish rule needed a capable governor. But before his work was done he was once more called away to a command in the field, this time in southern Italy, where he fought the Battle of Francavilla (20 June 1719), took Messina and besieged Palermo. For eleven years more he administered the Banat, reorganizing the country as a prosperous and civilized community.

In 1733 he was made a general field marshal in the army and in the Spring of that year he and the Irish-born Major General Baron Francis Patrick O&#x27;Neillan assembled 50,000 men at Mantua in an effort to reclaim all that had been lost the previous year when the Austrians had been driven from Italy by the Franco-Spanish forces. 

Mercy was killed on 29 June 1734 at the Battle of Parma while personally leading his troops. He left no children, and his name passed to Count Argenteau, from whom came the family of Mercy-Argenteau. He was the foster father of Florimund Count de Mercy d&#x27;Argenteau.

On 3 August 2009, a bust of the count was unveiled in Central Park, Timișoara.

<doc id="797114" wikidata="Q192635" url="?curid=797114" title="Ronald Koeman">
<text>Ronald Koeman (; born 21 March 1963) is a Dutch professional football manager and former player who is the manager of the Netherlands national team. Koeman scored over 250 goals whilst playing in defence for the majority of his career. Koeman was capable of playing both as a defender and as a midfielder; he frequently played as a sweeper, although he was equally known for his goalscoring, long-range shooting, and accuracy from free kicks and penalties. Because of his goalscoring, he is considered one of the best attacking center backs of all time.

Born in Zaandam, Koeman began his career at Groningen before transferring to the Netherlands&#x27; most successful club Ajax in 1983, where they won the national Eredivisie title in 1984–85. He then joined Ajax&#x27;s rivals PSV in 1986, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles (1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89) and the European Cup in 1988. Ronald Koeman is one of five European players to ever win a treble with their club and a cup with their national team in the same year. The other four players are his teammates Hans van Breukelen, Berry van Aerle, Gerald Vanenburg and Wim Kieft. In 1989, Koeman moved to Barcelona and became part of Johan Cruyff&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;, helping the club win La Liga four consecutive seasons (1991 to 1994), and the 1991–92 European Cup, where he scored the winning goal of the final against Sampdoria.

At international level, Koeman was one of the stars of the Netherlands national team, alongside Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Dennis Bergkamp. During his career with the Netherlands, Koeman won UEFA Euro 1988 and played at UEFA Euro 1992, as well as the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups, captaining the team at the latter.

In his managerial career, Koeman has won three Eredivisie titles: twice with Ajax (2001–02 and 2003–04) and once with PSV (2006–07). He is the only individual to have both played for and managed the &quot;Big Three&quot; of Dutch football: Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. Abroad, he had spells in Portugal with Benfica and Spain with Valencia, coaching &quot;Los Ché&quot; to victory in the 2007–08 Copa del Rey, and managed Premier League clubs Southampton and Everton in the 2010s. He was the manager of the Netherlands national team between 2018 and 2020, finishing runners-up in the 2019 UEFA Nations League. In August 2020, he was appointed manager of Barcelona, with whom he won the 2020–21 Copa del Rey, but was sacked in October 2021, following a poor start to the new season. In 2023, he was reappointed as the manager of the Netherlands national team.

==Club career==
===Netherlands===
Koeman started his professional career at Groningen, making his debut at the age of 17 years and 183 days in a 2–0 win over NEC in the Eredivisie. This made him the third-youngest player in the club&#x27;s history, after Piet Wildschut and Bert de Voogt. Thirty-three goals from ninety appearances in his three seasons at the club saw the young defender called up by the Netherlands national team and earn a transfer to Eredivisie champions Ajax. After failing to defend their title in Koeman&#x27;s first season at the club, the Amsterdam team regained the championship in 1984–85. The following season saw Johan Cruyff take over as Ajax head coach and, despite scoring 120 goals in 34 Eredivisie matches and winning the KNVB Cup, &quot;de Godenzonen&quot; could only finish second in the league behind rivals PSV.

In the summer of 1986, Koeman controversially transferred to PSV to play for Hans Kraay&#x27;s champions. Towards the end of the 1986–87 season, Kraay resigned and was replaced by Guus Hiddink, under the management of whom PSV overtook league leaders Ajax in the final weeks of the season to defend their league title. Koeman enjoyed further success with Hiddink and PSV in the following seasons, as the team also won the 1987–88 and 1988–89 Eredivisie titles and the club&#x27;s first, and to date only, European Cup against Benfica in Stuttgart on 25 May 1988. PSV had also won the KNVB Cup in both 1988 and 1989, making their successes in the two years trebles and doubles respectively. In his three seasons at PSV, Koeman scored 51 goals in 98 league appearances, averaging more than one goal every two matches. During 1987–88 season, he recorded the highest scoring season of his club career, with 21 goals scored in the league.

===Barcelona===
In 1989, Koeman re-joined his former Ajax coach Johan Cruyff at Barcelona, where he became a member of the famous &quot;Dream Team&quot;. During his first season at the club, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid 2–0 in the final. Along with players such as Hristo Stoichkov, Romário, Pep Guardiola and Michael Laudrup, Koeman helped the club win La Liga four consecutive seasons years (1991 to 1994). He scored the only goal of the 1992 European Cup Final with a free-kick from the edge of the 18-yard box against Sampdoria at Wembley Stadium to make &quot;Barça&quot; European champions for the first time in its history. With this, he became the first player to score in two consecutive finals of different European competitions, having scored Barcelona&#x27;s consolation goal in a 1–2 defeat against Manchester United in the 1991 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final.

Koeman was known for his powerful right-footed free kicks and deadball ability where he scored many vital goals for the team. One of his best strikes in La Liga came in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in 1994, with his bending free kick making the scoreline 2–0. Koeman was joint-top scorer with eight goals in the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League, in which Barcelona were beaten 0–4 in the final by A.C. Milan at the Olympic Stadium in Athens.

His nicknames while playing for Barcelona were &quot;Tintin&quot;, due to his physical similarity with Hergé&#x27;s fictional character, and &quot;Floquet de Neu&quot;, after the famous albino gorilla in the Barcelona Zoo.

===Return to the Netherlands and retirement===
After six years and over 200 appearances at Barcelona, Koeman left Spain to return to the Netherlands in 1995. In joining Feyenoord, he became one of the few players to represent all of Dutch football&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot;. Koeman spent two seasons in Rotterdam, captaining Feyenoord to third- and second-place finishes in the Eredivisie respectively.

Koeman ended his career with 192 league goals from 533 matches (ahead of Daniel Passarella, who netted 182 goals in 556 matches) during his career, more than any other defender in the history of football.

==International career==
In April 1983, both Koeman and his brother Erwin debuted for the Netherlands national team in a 3–0 friendly loss to Sweden in Utrecht. Ronald&#x27;s first international goal came in September of the same year, in a 3–0 victory of Iceland at Groningen&#x27;s Oosterpark Stadion.

With the Netherlands unable to qualify for UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Koeman&#x27;s tournament debut came at Euro 1988 in West Germany, where Rinus Michels&#x27; team defeated the hosts at the semi-final stage, with Koeman scoring a crucial penalty to equalize and make it 1–1. After this match, Koeman provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of Olaf Thon in front of the home supporters.
In the final, the Netherlands defeated the Soviet Union 2–0 at Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion to win the nation&#x27;s only major international trophy. This completed Koeman&#x27;s extraordinary 1988 after winning the treble with PSV. Both Koeman and his central defensive partner Frank Rijkaard were named in UEFA&#x27;s Team of the Tournament.

Koeman went on to represent his nation at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, as well as Euro 1992, and picked up a total of 78 caps for the Netherlands, scoring 14 goals.

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
Having retired as a player after his stint with Feyenoord, Koeman became a member of the Netherlands international coaching staff of Guus Hiddink during the 1998 World Cup along with Johan Neeskens and Frank Rijkaard. After the tournament, he was appointed the assistant coach of Barcelona, and in 2000, he was handed his first managerial job as the head coach of Vitesse, where he led the team to a UEFA Cup spot in his only season.

===Ajax===
Koeman was appointed the manager of Ajax in 2001. He won a domestic double in 2001–02. Despite regaining the title in 2003–04, Ajax had fallen eight points behind rivals PSV in the Eredivisie. This situation, coupled with Ajax being knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Auxerre, 3–2 on aggregate, led Koeman to resign the following day on 25 February 2005. During Koeman&#x27;s spell at Ajax, a young Zlatan Ibrahimovic started his rise to international fame, and Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart made their debut.

===Benfica===
In June 2005, Koeman took up the vacant position at Portuguese champions Benfica, following the departure of Giovanni Trapattoni. On 13 August, he won the 2005 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira against Vitória de Setúbal with a single goal by Nuno Gomes. The team finished the Primeira Liga in third place (behind rivals Porto and Sporting CP) and was knocked out of the Taça de Portugal in the quarter-finals by Vitória de Guimarães. This, along with an offer from PSV, sufficed for the manager to leave one year before the end of his contract. Under Koeman, Benfica did reach the quarter-finals of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League; eliminating Manchester United in the final game of the group stage and Liverpool in the first knockout stage, before losing to Barcelona on an aggregate score of 0–2, who ended up winning the trophy.

===PSV===
In the 2006–07 season, Koeman served as head coach of PSV, as successor to Guus Hiddink. PSV dominated the first season half, keeping competitors AZ Alkmaar and Ajax at a reasonable distance, and PSV seemed almost destined to become champions again. PSV, however, suffered in the second half of the season, also because of injuries of players Jefferson Farfán, Alex and Ibrahim Afellay, obtaining only 19 out 39 possible points. Alkmaar and Ajax regained their momentum, making for a close finish, with all three teams tied at 72 points before the last competition day. Alkmaar played struggling Excelsior in their final match, but did not manage to win. Ajax played at Willem II, but did not score enough goals; it was PSV eventually who triumphed, winning at home 5–1 against Vitesse, and thereby becoming Eredivisie champions, one goal ahead of Ajax.

For the second consecutive season he guided a team to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, this time defeating another English club in the shape of Arsenal in the first knockout stage by an aggregate score of 2–1, before losing 4–0 on aggregate to eventual runners-up Liverpool in the quarter-finals.

===Valencia===
On 31 October 2007, Koeman agreed to be the new coach of Valencia after the sacking of Quique Sánchez Flores, starting on 5 November 2007. With Valencia, he won the 2007–08 Copa del Rey, a tournament he previously won as a player with Barcelona. This was Valencia&#x27;s first Copa del Rey since 1999. The remainder of his tenure at Valencia would prove disappointing: the team would slump to 15th in the league, only two points above the relegation zone, as well as finishing bottom of their Champions League group. A 1–5 defeat by Athletic Bilbao would prove the final straw for Koeman&#x27;s time with Valencia. He was sacked the following day, on 21 April 2008.

===AZ Alkmaar===
Koeman was appointed manager of AZ Alkmaar on 18 May 2009, after Louis van Gaal, who won the 2008–09 Eredivisie with Alkmaar, joined Bayern Munich. On 5 December 2009, Alkmaar announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of the club, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in the Dutch competition.

===Feyenoord===
On 21 July 2011, Koeman was appointed manager of Feyenoord, signing a one-year contract with the Dutch club as replacement for outgoing trainer Mario Been. Through this appointment, Koeman notably became the first individual ever to serve as both player and head coach at all teams of the so-called &quot;traditional big three&quot; of Dutch football – Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. Moreover, he has completed this in the same order as player and as manager. At the beginning of 2012, it was announced that his contract was extended. In February 2014, Koeman announced that he would leave his position at Feyenoord at the end of the 2013–14 season to pursue other ambitions.

===Southampton===
In June 2014, Koeman was announced as the replacement for Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino, signing a three-year deal with the club. His brother Erwin was appointed assistant manager.

In his first six Premier League games in charge of the club, Koeman managed four wins, a draw and a defeat, propelling Southampton to second place in the league standings and resulting in Koeman being named Premier League Manager of the Month for September. In January 2015, Southampton won all three of their matches, including a first win at Manchester United since 1988, and Koeman was again named Manager of the Month. He led Southampton to a seventh-place finish at the end of the season.

Koeman won his third Premier League Manager of the Month for January 2016, on the way to Southampton&#x27;s highest ever Premier League finish, sixth place, highest ever Premier League points total, 63, and qualification for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League.

===Everton===
On 14 June 2016, Koeman was confirmed as manager of Everton, signing a three-year contract. His brother was again hired as his assistant. In his first season, Koeman led Everton to qualification for the Europa League.

Prior to the 2017–18 season, Koeman was given the largest budget in Everton&#x27;s history to spend on new players. An estimated £150 million was spent on new players, but Koeman admitted that he had not bought a centre forward to replace Romelu Lukaku, the previous season&#x27;s squad top scorer who had been sold to Manchester United. Koeman was sacked by the club on 23 October 2017, after his side fell into the relegation zone, following a 2–5 home defeat against Arsenal the previous day. Koeman later stated his belief that the failure to sign Olivier Giroud in the summer transfer window contributed to his sacking.

===Netherlands===
On 6 February 2018, Koeman was appointed manager of the Netherlands national team on a four-and-a-half-year contract up to and including the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He replaced Dick Advocaat who resigned after failing to guide the Netherlands to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

On 9 June 2019, the Netherlands finished runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League after a 0–1 defeat against Portugal in the final.

On 19 August 2020, Koeman left the national team to become manager of Barcelona. Under his management, Netherlands qualified for a final tournament, UEFA Euro 2020, for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup after missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

===Barcelona===
On 19 August 2020, Koeman was announced as the new manager of Barcelona, on a two-year contract until 30 June 2022. He took over after Quique Setién had been dismissed from the post following a disastrous 8–2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the quarter final of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. In his first competitive game in charge, Barcelona beat Villarreal 4–0 at the Camp Nou in La Liga. On 17 October, Koeman suffered his first loss as Barcelona manager after a 1–0 away defeat against Getafe. On 24 October, he lost the first &quot;Clásico&quot; of the season to arch rivals Real Madrid by a 3–1 scoreline. That defeat was followed by a 1–1 draw against Alavés, which resulted in Barcelona equalling their worst tally after the first six games in La Liga (8 points, as few as in the 2002–03 season).
In the following weeks, several disappointing occurred and with yet another loss against Atletico Madrid, Barcelona ended up with their worst league start since 1992, having won only 11 points in the first 8 La Liga matches.

On 17 January 2021, Koeman managed Barcelona for the first time in a cup final, with his side losing 3–2 to Athletic Bilbao after extra time in the final of the 2020–21 Supercopa de España at the Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville. On 7 February, Koeman led Barcelona to their sixth consecutive away win in La Liga after winning 3–2 against Real Betis, equalling Luis Enrique&#x27;s feat achieved in the 2015–16 season. On 11 March, Barcelona were knocked out of the Champions League in the round of 16 against PSG after failing to turn around a 1–4 loss at home, losing 2–5 on aggregate. On 10 April, Barcelona&#x27;s 19-game unbeaten run in La Liga came to an end after falling to Real Madrid 2–1 away from home in the second &quot;Clásico&quot; of the season. On 17 April, Koeman led &quot;Barça&quot; to a 4–0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the 2021 Copa del Rey Final, gaining revenge for the Supercopa defeat at the same venue three months earlier. On 29 April, Barcelona were presented with a golden opportunity to go top of La Liga but failed to capitalize after losing out to Granada away 2–1 despite taking the lead. Barcelona&#x27;s title charge ended with a disappointment after winning only two of their last five matches and eventually finished third in the league table. Following the end of the season, club president Joan Laporta admitted that Koeman was not his first choice and was looking for a manager, however on 3 June, he confirmed that Koeman would be staying in charge for another season.

Barcelona began the 2021–22 season with a 4–2 home victory over Real Sociedad in La Liga. However, in their next ten matches, they had a disappointing run of games with 4 wins, 3 draws and 3 defeats including consecutive 3–0 losses against Bayern Munich and Benfica in the Champions League group stage and a 2–0 away defeat against title contenders Atletico Madrid in La Liga. On 24 October, following &quot;Barça&#x27;s&quot; 2–1 defeat against Real Madrid at home, Koeman became the first manager since Patrick O’Connell in 1936 to lose three consecutive &quot;Clásicos.&quot; On 28 October, the club announced that Koeman had been relieved of his duties as manager following the team&#x27;s 1–0 away defeat against Rayo Vallecano, with FC Barcelona sitting at a dissatisfying 9th place on the table. A week later, Xavi was announced as his replacement.

===Return to the Netherlands===
On 6 April 2022, Koeman was announced as returning to role of manager of the Netherlands national team, and would commence in the role on 1 January 2023 after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, following the third retirement of Louis van Gaal. On 23 January 2023, he was introduced as Dutch national team coach, with an intention to go back to a 4-3-3 formation. On 24 March, he managed his first match during the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying which ended in a 4–0 defeat against France with his team trailing by three goals after 21 minutes, an underperformance occurred more than a century after the Dutch loss to Sweden 4–1 on 24 August 1919, with three goals being scored within the first 20 minutes.

In the 2024 European championship, the Netherlands were drawn with France, Poland and Austria in the Group D. The Dutch defeated Poland 2–1 in the first matchday, and against France they had to settle for a 0–0 draw. In their final group match, the Netherlands lost to Austria, conceding three goals and scoring two. The Netherlands finished Group D among the four best third placed teams, thus ensuring qualification to the Round of 16, where they played against Romania and won 3–0. In the Quarter finals, the Dutch defeated Turkey 2–1, but were eliminated by England in the Semi finals, losing 2–1. This was the first time since 2014 that the Netherlands had made the semi-finals of a major international tournament.

==Style of play==
A composed player on the ball, Koeman was capable of being deployed both as a defender and as a midfielder, and he frequently played as a sweeper, due to his vision and his ability on the ball. Regarded as one of the best and most prolific attacking central defenders of all time, due to his eye for goal, Koeman was renowned for his long-range passing, as well as his shooting accuracy and power from distance, especially on free kicks; he is the top scoring defender in world football, and Barcelona&#x27;s top scoring defender. A versatile set piece specialist, Koeman was nicknamed the &quot;King of free kicks&quot;, and was capable of striking the ball with power from long range free kicks, or curling shots on goal from close range; he was also an accurate penalty kick taker. Regarding his unique run-up and approach to taking free kicks and penalties, Rob Smyth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented in 2009: &quot;We tend to associate Koeman with that particular type of free-kick, where he would lace the ball in a manner that was paradoxically sledgehammer rather than silk, yet if anything he was more adept at the seductive, shorter-range curler. As with his penalties, when he would charge towards the ball like a man with murder in mind only to tap it gently into the net, part of the skill was in the deception. With Koeman, there was more than one way to skin a defensive wall; as all Englishmen know well, he could flippin&#x27; flip one as well.&quot;

==Style of management==
Koeman most commonly organises his teams to have a defensive approach led by their method of attack, whether that be a 4–3–3, a 4-2-3-1 or an alternative, and to defend with minimal space between the lines. Describing his coaching style when appointed as manager of Barcelona, he said &quot;I’m a coach who likes his teams to be disciplined and well-organised team. I like to dominate games. The Dutch like attacking football. I like to be direct and have good communication with my players. We hold short meetings but that make the message clear.&quot;

==Records==
Koeman is the top scoring defender in world football, scoring 90 goals in all competitions for Barcelona. An accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, Koeman was nicknamed the &quot;King of free kicks&quot; throughout his playing career, and is Barcelona&#x27;s second-highest goalscorer from free kicks, after previous club captain Lionel Messi, with 26 goals from set pieces in all competitions; he is also Barcelona&#x27;s second-highest scorer from penalties in La Liga, behind Messi once again, with 46 goals from spot kicks, and the highest scoring defender in La Liga from penalties. With 67 goals, he is the second most prolific defender in La Liga history, behind Sergio Ramos. He currently holds the record for 25 consecutive successful penalty conversions in La Liga.

==Personal life==
Ronald is the son of former Dutch international Martin Koeman and the younger brother of his former international teammate Erwin Koeman.

He is married to Bartina Koeman. Their son, Ronald Koeman Jr., is a professional goalkeeper for SC Telstar in the Eerste Divisie.

When Erwin was appointed as the head coach of 
Oman in 2019, they became the first set of brothers to take charge of two different national teams at the same time

Koeman is an ambassador for the anti-smoking campaign Kick it with Help. He said that the cancer diagnoses of his wife and his friend Johan Cruyff motivated him to join the campaign.

During the transfer as a manager to Barcelona in 2020, Koeman was filmed for a 3-part docuseries entitled, &quot;Força Koeman&quot;. The series can be seen on Dutch streaming service &quot;videoland&quot; from 17 February 2021.

Koeman stated that he has been visiting the Portuguese region of Algarve since 1988 after the victory of PSV in the 1988 European Cup Final against Portuguese football club SL Benfica. He bought a plot of land with there in 2004 and built a 2,000,000 euro house for him in Vale do Lobo between 2005 and 2006.

<text>Powel Crosley Jr. (September 18, 1886 – March 28, 1961) was an American inventor, industrialist, and entrepreneur. He was also a pioneer in radio broadcasting, and owner of the Cincinnati Reds major league baseball team. In addition, Crosley&#x27;s companies manufactured Crosley automobiles and radios, and operated WLW radio station. Crosley, once dubbed &quot;The Henry Ford of Radio,&quot; was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2010 and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2013.

He and his brother, Lewis M. Crosley, were responsible for many firsts in consumer products and broadcasting. During World War II, Crosley&#x27;s facilities produced more proximity fuzes than any other U.S. manufacturer, and made several production design innovations. Crosley Field, a stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, was renamed for him, and the street-level main entrance to Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati is named Crosley Terrace in his honor. Crosley&#x27;s Pinecroft estate home in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Seagate, his former winter retreat in Sarasota, Florida are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Early life and education==
Powel Crosley Jr. was born on September 18, 1886, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Charlotte Wooley (Utz) (1864–1949) and Powel Crosley Sr. (1849–1932), a lawyer. Powel Jr. was the oldest of the family&#x27;s four children. Crosley became interested in the mechanics of automobiles at a young age and wanted to become an automaker. While living with his family in College Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati, twelve-year-old Crosley made his first attempt at building a vehicle.

Crosley began high school in College Hill and transferred to the Ohio Military Institute. In 1904 Crosley enrolled at the University of Cincinnati, where he began studies in engineering, but switched to law, primarily to satisfy his father, before dropping out of college in 1906 after two years of study.

==Marriage and family==
Crosley married Gwendolyn Bakewell Aiken (1889–1939) in Hamilton County, Ohio, on October 17, 1910. They had two children. After his marriage, Crosley continued to work in automobile sales in Muncie to earn money to buy a house, while his wife returned to Cincinnati to live with her parents. The young couple saw each other on the weekends until Crosley returned to Cincinnati in 1911 to live and work after the birth of his first child. Gwendolyn Crosley, who suffered from tuberculosis, died at the Crosleys&#x27; winter home in Sarasota, Florida, on February 26, 1939.

Crosley married Eva Emily Brokaw (1912–1955) in 1952. She died in Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Real estate==
Crosley&#x27;s primary residence was Pinecroft, an estate home built in 1929 in the Mount Airy section of Cincinnati, Ohio. He also had Seagate, a winter retreat in Manatee County, Florida, built for his first wife, Gwendolyn. In addition, Crosley owned several vacation properties.

===Pinecroft===
Pinecroft, Crosley&#x27;s two-story, , Tudor Revival-style mansion and other buildings on his estate in Mount Airy was designed by New York-based architect Dwight James Baum and built in 1928–29. Crosley&#x27;s daughter, Marth Page (Crosley) Kess, sold the property after her father&#x27;s death in 1961, and the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor acquired the property in 1963. Saint Francis Hospital bought a portion of the property north of the Crosley mansion in 1971 and built a hospital, which was renamed Mercy Hospitals West in 2001. The land surrounding the home has been subdivided into parcels, but the Franciscan Sisters have used the mansion as a retreat since the early 1970s. Pinecroft was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

===Seagate===

Seagate, also known as the Bay Club, along Sarasota Bay in the southwest corner of Manatee County, Florida, was a Mediterranean Revival-style home designed for Crosley by New York City and Sarasota architect George Albree Freeman Jr., with Ivo A. de Minicis, a Tampa, Florida, architect, drafting the plans. Sarasota contractor Paul W. Bergman built the winter retreat in 1929–30 on a parcel of land. The two-and-a-half-story house include ten bedrooms and ten bathrooms, as well as auxiliary garages and living quarters for staff. The house contains and is reportedly the first residence built in Florida using steel-frame construction to provide protection against fires and hurricanes. After Crosley&#x27;s wife, Gwendolyn, died of tuberculosis at the retreat in 1939, he rarely used the house. During World War II, Crosley allowed the U.S. Army Air Corps to use the retreat for its airmen training at the nearby Sarasota Army Air Base. Crosley sold his estate property in 1947 to the D and D Corporation.

Mabel and Freeman Horton purchased the property in 1948 and owned Seagate for nearly forty years. The house and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 1983, by a subsequent owner who intended to build an exclusive condominium project on the site using the historic house as a clubhouse, but the project failed when the economy faltered shortly thereafter. Kafi Benz, the Friends of Seagate Inc., a nonprofit corporation, and local residents saved Seagate from commercial development, and initiated a campaign for its preservation and public acquisition. In 1991 the state of Florida purchased the property and of the bay-front estate that included the structures that Crosley had built in 1929–30. A larger portion of the original property was developed into a satellite campus for the University of South Florida. The University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee campus opened its new facilities in August 2006. The present-day mansion, called the Powel Crosley Estate, is used as a meeting, conference, and event venue.

===Vacation homes===
Crosley, an avid sportsman, also owned several sports, hunting, and fishing camps, including an island retreat called Nikassi on McGregor Bay, Lake Huron, Canada; Bull Island, South Carolina; Pimlico Plantation, along the Cooper River north of Charleston, South Carolina; Sleepy Hollow Farm, a retreat in Jennings County, Indiana and a house at Cat Cays, Bahamas.

==Early career==
Crosley began work selling bonds for an investment banker; however, at the age of twenty-one he decided to pursue a career in automobile manufacturing. The mass-production techniques employed by Henry Ford also caught his attention and would be implemented by his brother, Lewis, when the two began manufacturing radios in 1921.

In 1907 Crosley formed a company to build the Marathon Six, a six-cylinder model priced at $1,700, which was at the low end of the luxury car market. With $10,000 in capital that he raised from investors, Crosley established Marathon Six Automotive inexpensive automobile, in Connersville, Indiana, and built a prototype of his car, but a nationwide financial panic caused investment capital to dwindle and he failed to fund its production.

Still determined to establish himself as an automaker, Crosley moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he worked for Carl G. Fisher as a shop hand at the Fisher Automobile Company. Crosley stayed for about a year, but left after he broke his arm starting a car at the auto dealership. After recovering from his injury at home in College Hill, Crosley returned to Indianapolis in 1909 to briefly work for several auto manufacturers, including jobs as an assistant sales manager for the Parry Auto Company and a salesman for the National Motor Vehicle Company. He also volunteered to help promote National&#x27;s auto racing team. His next job was selling advertising for &quot;Motor Vehicle&quot;, an automotive trade journal, but left in 1910 to move to Muncie, Indiana, where he worked in sales for the Inter-State Automobile Company and promoted its racing team.

==Early automobile and parts manufacturer==
After returning to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1911, Crosley sold and wrote advertisements for local businesses, but continued to pursue his interests in the automobile industry. He 
failed in early efforts to manufacture cars for the Hermes Automobile Company and cyclecars for the De Cross Cyclecar Company and the L. Porter Smith and Brothers Company before finding financial success in manufacturing and distributing automobile accessories.

In 1916 he co-founded the American Automobile Accessory Company with Ira J. Cooper. The company&#x27;s bestseller was a tire liner of Crosley&#x27;s invention. Another popular product was a flag holder that held five American flags and clamped to auto radiator caps. By 1919 Crosley had sales of more than $1 million in parts. He also diversified into other consumer products such as phonograph cabinets, radios, and home appliances. Crosley&#x27;s greatest strength was his ability to invent new products, while his brother, Lewis M. Crosley, excelled in business. Lewis also became head of Crosley&#x27;s manufacturing operations.

In 1920, Crosley first selected independent local dealers as the best way to take his products to market. He insisted that all sellers of his products must give the consumer the best in parts, service, and satisfaction. Always sensitive to consumers, his products were often less expensive than other name brands, but were guaranteed. Crosley&#x27;s &quot;money back guarantee&quot; set a precedent for some of today&#x27;s most outstanding sales policies.

==Radio manufacturer==
In 1921 Crosley&#x27;s young son asked for a radio, a new item at that time, but Crosley was surprised that toy radios cost more than $100 at a local department store. With the help of a booklet called &quot;The ABC of Radio,&quot; he and his son decided to assemble the components and build their own crystal radio set. Crosley immediately recognized the appeal of an inexpensive radio and hired two University of Cincinnati students to help design a low-cost set that could be mass-produced. Crosley named the radio the &quot;Harko&quot; and introduced it to the market in 1921. The inexpensive radio set sold for $7, making it affordable to the masses. Soon, the Crosley Radio Corporation was manufacturing radio components for the rapidly growing industry and making its own line of radios.

By 1924 Crosley had moved his company to a larger plant and later made subsequent expansions. The Crosley Radio Corporation became the largest radio manufacturer in the world in 1925; its slogan, &quot;You’re There With A Crosley,&quot; was used in all its advertising.

In 1925 Crosley introduced another low-cost radio set. The small, one-tube, regenerative radio was called the &quot;Crosley Pup&quot; and sold for $9.75. While Victor had the rights to &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;, its famous trademark showing Nipper listening to a phonograph, Crosley adopted a mascot in the form of a dog with headphones listening to a Crosley Pup radio
In 1928 Crosley&#x27;s firm arranged for the construction of the Crosley Building at Camp Washington, a Cincinnati neighborhood, and used the facility for radio manufacturing, radio broadcasting, and for manufacturing other devices.

In 1930 Crosley was marketing the &quot;Roamio,&quot; with &quot;screen grid neutrodyne power speaker&quot; for automotive use. Priced at $75, before accessories and installation, it was claimed to be able to receive thirty stations with no signal strength change.

==Radio broadcasting==

Once Crosley established himself as a radio manufacturer, he decided to expand into broadcasting as a way to encourage consumers to purchase more radios. In 1921, soon after he built his first radios, Crosley began experimental broadcasts from his home with a 20-watt transmitter using the call sign 8CR. On March 22, 1922, the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation received a commercial license to operate as WLW at 50 watts. Dorman D. Israel, a young radio engineer from the University of Cincinnati, designed and built the station&#x27;s first two radio transmitters (at 100 and 1,000 watts). The Crosley Corporation claimed that in 1928 WLW became the first 50-kilowatt commercial station in the United States with a regular broadcasting schedule. In 1934 Crosley put a 500-kilowatt transmitter on the air, making WLW the station with the world&#x27;s most powerful radio transmitter for the next five years. (On occasion, the station&#x27;s power was boosted as high as 700,000 watts.)

Throughout the 1930s, Cincinnati&#x27;s WLW was considered &quot;the Nation&#x27;s Station,&quot; producing many hours of network programming each week. Among the entertainers who performed live from WLW&#x27;s studios were Red Skelton, Doris Day, Jane Froman, Fats Waller, Rosemary Clooney, and the Mills Brothers. In 1939 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that WLW had to reduce its power to 50 kilowatts, partly because it interfered with the broadcasts of other stations, but largely due to its smaller competitors, who complained about the station&#x27;s technical and commercial advantages with its 500-kilowatt broadcasts.

During World War II, WLW resumed its powerful, 500-kilowatt transmissions in cooperation with the U.S. government. The 500-kilowatt transmitter was crated for shipment to Asia, but the war ended before it was shipped. WLW&#x27;s engineers also built high-power shortwave transmitters on a site about north of Cincinnati. Crosley Broadcasting, under contract to the U.S. government, began operating the Bethany Relay Station, which was dedicated on September 23, 1944, to broadcast &quot;Voice of America&quot; programming. The relay station&#x27;s broadcasts continued until 1994.

Crosley&#x27;s broadcasting company eventually expanded into additional markets. The company was experimenting with television broadcasting as early as 1929, when it received an experimental television license from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which later became the FCC. Crosley Broadcasting did not go on-air with regular television programming as WLWT until after Crosley sold the company to Aviation Corporation (Avco) and he had become a member of Avco&#x27;s board of directors..

==Appliance and consumer products manufacturer==

In the 1930s Crosley added refrigerators and other household appliances and consumer goods to his company&#x27;s product line.

Crosley&#x27;s &quot;Icyball&quot; was an early non-electrical refrigeration device. The unit used an evaporative cycle to create cold, and had no moving parts. The dumbbell shaped unit was &quot;charged&quot; by heating one end with a small kerosene heater. Crosley&#x27;s company sold several hundred thousand Icyball units before discontinuing its manufacture in the late 1930s.

In 1932 Crosley had the idea of putting shelves in the doors of refrigerators. He patented the &quot;Shelvador&quot; refrigerator and launched the new appliance in 1933. At that time it was the only model with shelves in the door. In addition to refrigerators, Crosley&#x27;s company sold other consumer products that included the &quot;XERVAC,&quot; a device purported to &quot;revitalize inactive hair cells&quot; and &quot;stimulate hair growth&quot;. Crosley also introduced the &quot;Autogym,&quot; a motor-driven weight-loss device with a vibrating belt, and the &quot;Go-Bi-Bi,&quot; a &quot;rideable baby walker,&quot; among other products.

==Baseball team owner and sportsman==
In February 1934, Crosley purchased the Cincinnati Reds professional baseball team from Sidney Weil, who had lost much of his wealth after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Crosley kept the team from going bankrupt and leaving Cincinnati. He was also owner of the Reds when the team won two National League titles (in 1939 and 1940) and the World Series in 1940.

Crosley was also a pioneer in broadcasting baseball games on the radio. On May 24, 1935, the first nighttime game in Major League baseball history was held at Cincinnati&#x27;s Crosley Field, which was renamed in Crosley&#x27;s honor after he acquired the team (before this, the ballpark was named Redland Field), between the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies under newly installed electric lighting. With attendance at its evening games more than four times greater that its daytime events, the team&#x27;s financial position was greatly improved. Crosley also approved baseball&#x27;s first regularly-scheduled play-by-play broadcasts of all scheduled games on his local station, WSAI, whose call letters stood for &quot;sports and information,&quot; and later on WLW. The coverage increased attendance so much that within five years all 16 major league teams had radio broadcasts of every scheduled game.

On a personal level, Crosley was an avid sportsman. Although he never had a pilot&#x27;s license, Crosley owned several seaplanes, such as the Douglas Dolphin, and airplanes, including building five Crosley &quot;Moonbeam&quot; airplanes. In addition, Crosley claimed that at one time he was slotted to be a driver in the Indianapolis 500, but that claim was not entirely accurate. He was entered but broke his arm working for Carl Fisher (see above). Crosley was also the owner of luxury yachts with powerful engines, and an active fisherman who participated in celebrated tournaments in Sarasota, Florida. He served as president of the Sarasota area&#x27;s Anglers Club and was a founder of the American Wildlife Institute. Crosley owned several sports, hunting, and fishing camps: Nikassi, an island retreat in Ontario, Canada; Bull Island off the coast of South Carolina; a hunting retreat he called Sleepy Hollow Farm in Jennings County, Indiana, and a Caribbean vacation home at Cat Cays, Bahamas.

== Aircraft manufacturer ==
The Crosley &quot;Moonbeam&quot; was built in Sharonville, Ohio and was first flown on December 8, 1929. It was designed by Harold D. Hoekstra, an employee of Crosley&#x27;s when Crosley was president of the Crosley Aircraft Company. (Hoeskstra later became Chief of Engineering and Design for the Federal Aviation Administration.) Unique features of this aircraft are the square tube longerons used in the fuselage construction, use of torque tubes instead of control cable, and the corrugated aluminum ailerons. Original power was supplied by a four-cylinder inverted inline 90 hp Crosley engine. At one time it was also tested with a 110 Warner Scarab engine. N147N reportedly was the first airplane on which the spoilers were tested (in May 1930) as a lateral control device. Five Moonbeams airplanes were produced. The first was a three-place parasol; next, a four-place, high wing cabin model; third and fourth were one place high wings. Due to the Great Depression, planned production did not take place. N147N is the last of these planes in existence. It is housed at the Aviation Museum of Kentucky in Lexington Kentucky.

In 1933 Frenchman Henri Mignet designed the HM.14 &quot;Pou du Ciel&quot; (&quot;Flying Flea&quot;). He envisioned a simple aircraft that amateurs could build, and even teach themselves to fly. In an attempt to render the aircraft stall proof and safe for amateur pilots to fly, Mignet staggered the two main wings. The Mignet-Crosley &quot;Pou du Ciel&quot; is the first HM.14 made and flown in the United States. Edward Nirmaier, a Crosley employee, and two other men built the airplane in November 1935 for Crosley, who believed that the affordable &quot;Flea&quot; could become a popular aircraft in the United States. After several flights, a crash at the Miami Air Races in December 1935 finally grounded the Crosley HM.14. Although the airplane enjoyed a period of intense popularity in France and England, a series of accidents in 1935-36 permanently ruined the airplane&#x27;s reputation.

==Automaker==

Of all Crosley&#x27;s dreams, success at building an affordable automobile for Americans was possibly the only major one eventually to elude him. In the years leading up to World War II, Crosley developed new products that included reviving one of his earliest endeavors at automobile design and manufacturing. In 1939, when Crosley introduced the low-priced Crosley automobiles, he broke with tradition and sold his cars through independent appliance, hardware, and department stores instead of automobile dealerships.

The first Crosley Motors, Inc. automobile made its debut at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on April 28, 1939, to mixed reviews. The compact car had an wheelbase and a , 
two-cylinder, air cooled Waukesha engine. Crosley estimated that his cloth-top car, which weighed less than , could get fifty miles per gallon at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour. The sedan model sold for $325, while the coupe sold for $350. Panel truck and pickup truck models were added to the product line in 1940. During the pre-war period, the company had manufacturing plants in Camp Washington, Ohio; Richmond, Indiana; and Marion, Indiana. When the onset of war ended all automobile production in the United States in 1942, Crosley had produced 5,757 cars.

After World War II ended, Crosley resumed building its small cars for civilian use. His company&#x27;s first post-war automobile rolled off the assembly line on May 9, 1946. The new Crosley &quot;CC&quot; model automobile continued the company&#x27;s pre-war tradition of offering small, lightweight, and low-priced cars. It sold for $850 and got thirty to fifty miles per U.S. gallon. In 1949 Crosley became the first American carmaker to put disc brakes on all of its models.

Unfortunately for Crosley, fuel economy ceased to be an inducement after gas rationing ended, and American consumers also began to prefer bigger cars. Crosley&#x27;s best year was 1948, when it sold 24,871 cars, but sales began to fall in 1949. Adding the Crosley &quot;Hotshot&quot; sports model and an all-purpose vehicle called the &quot;Farm-O-Road&quot; model in 1950 did not stop the decline. Only 1,522 Crosley vehicles were sold in 1952. Crosley sold about 84,000 cars before closing down the operation on July 3, 1952. The Crosley plant in Marion, Indiana, was sold to the General Tire and Rubber Company.

==War-production contractor==
Crosley&#x27;s company was involved in war production planning before December 1941, and like the rest of American industry, it focused on manufacturing war-related products during World War II. The company made a variety of products, including proximity fuzes, experimental military vehicles, radio transceivers, and gun turrets, among other items.

===Proximity fuzes===
The most significant Crosley&#x27;s wartime production was the proximity fuze, which was manufactured by several companies for the military. Crosley&#x27;s facilities produced more fuzes than any other manufacturer and made several production design innovations. The fuze is widely considered the third most important product development of the war years, ranking behind the atomic bomb and radar.

Ironically, Crosley himself did not have U.S. government security clearance and was not involved with the project. Without government security clearance, Crosley was prohibited from entering the area of his plant that manufactured the fuzes and did not know what top-secret products it produced until the war&#x27;s end. Production was directed and supervised by Lewis M. Clement, the Crosley company&#x27;s vice-president of engineering.

James V. Forrestal, U.S. Secretary of the Navy said: &quot;The proximity fuze has helped blaze the trail to Japan. Without the protection this ingenious device has given the surface ships of the Fleet, our westward push could not have been so swift and the cost in men and ships would have been immeasurably greater.&quot; George S. Patton, Commanding General of the Third Army, remarked: &quot;The funny fuze won the Battle of the Bulge for us. I think that when all armies get this shell we will have to devise some new method of warfare.&quot;

===Radio transceivers, gun turrets, and other products===
Also of significance were the many radio transceivers that Crosley&#x27;s company manufactured during the war, including 150,000 BC-654s, a receiver and transmitter that was the main component of the SCR-284 radio set. The Crosley Corporation also made components for Walkie-talkie transceivers and IFR radio guidance equipment, among other products. In addition, Crosley&#x27;s also manufactured field kitchens, air supply units for Sperry S-1 bombsites (used in B-24 bombers), air conditioning units, Martin PBM Mariner bow-gun turrets, and quarter-ton trailers. Gun turrets for PT boats and B-24 and B-29 bombers were the company&#x27;s largest military contract.

===Experimental military vehicles===
During the war, Crosley&#x27;s auto manufacturing division, CRAD (for Crosley Radio Auto Division), in Richmond, Indiana, produced experimental motorcycles, tricycles, four-wheel-drive vehicles, and continuous track vehicles, including some amphibious models. All of these military prototypes were powered by the two-cylinder boxer engine that had powered the original Crosley automobile. Crosley had nearly 5,000 of these engines on hand when civilian automobile production ceased in 1942, and hoped to put them to use in his miniature war machines.

One vehicle prototype was the 1942/1943 Crosley CT-3 &quot;Pup,&quot; a lightweight, single-passenger, four-wheel-drive vehicle that was transportable and air-droppable from a C-47 Skytrain. Six of the Pups were deployed overseas after undergoing tests at Fort Benning, Georgia, but the Pup project was discontinued due to several weak components. Seven of the thirty-seven Pups that were built are known to survive.

==Later years==
Although Crosley retained ownership of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team and Crosley Motors, he sold his other business interests, including WLW radio and the Crosley Corporation, to the Aviation Corporation (Avco) in 1945. Crosley remained on the Avco board for several years afterward. Avco put Ohio&#x27;s second television station, WLWT-TV, on the air in 1948, the same year it began manufacturing television sets. Avco manufactured some of the first portable television sets under the Crosley brand name. Crosley ceased to exist as a brand in 1956, when Avco closed the unprofitable product line; however, the Crosley name was so well established that Avco&#x27;s broadcasting division, owner of WLWT-TV, retained the Crosley name until 1968, seven years after Crosley&#x27;s death.

Crosley sold Pimlico Plantation, now demolished, in 1942, and Seagate, his winter retreat in Florida in 1947. In 1954 Crosley sold his vacation home at Cat Keys, Bahamas. In 1956 he sold Sleepy Hollow Farm in Jennings County, Indiana, to the state of Indiana for use as a wildlife preserve. Bull Island, South Carolina, became part of a national wildlife refuge. It is not known when Crosley sold his vacation retreat in Ontario, Canada.

==Death and legacy==
Crosley died on March 28, 1961, of a heart attack at the age of 74. He is buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

Crosley liked to label himself &quot;the man with 50 jobs in 50 years,&quot; a catchy sobriquet that was far from true, although he did have more than a dozen jobs before he got into automobile accessories. Crosley helped quite a few inventors up the ladder of success by buying the rights to their inventions and sharing in the profits. His work provided employment and products for millions of people.

A few of Crosley&#x27;s company&#x27;s more noteworthy accomplishments:
* introduced the first compact car to American consumers (in 1939)
* became the second company to install car radios in its models 
* the first to introduce push-button car radios 
* introduced soap operas to radio broadcasts
* introduced the first non-electric refrigerator (Icyball)
* introduced the first refrigerator with shelves in the door (Shelvador)
* launched the world&#x27;s most powerful commercial radio station (WLW, at 500 kW)
* installed the first lights on a major league baseball field* introduced facsimile newspaper broadcasts by radio-FAX (Reado)
* the first American carmaker to have disc brakes on all its models (in 1949)

Part of Crosley&#x27;s Pinecroft estate, his former Cincinnati, Ohio, home, is the site of Mercy Hospitals West; however, the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor have used his mansion as a retreat since the early 1970s. Seagate, Crosley&#x27;s former winter retreat on Sarasota Bay in Florida, is operated as an event rental facility. Pinecroft and Seagate have been restored and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Crosley&#x27;s farm in Jennings County, Indiana, is the site of the present-day Crosley Fish and Wildlife Area; Bull Island, South Carolina, is part of the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge.

WLW radio continues to operate as an AM station. Crosley&#x27;s manufacturing plants in Richmond and Marion, Indiana, are still standing, but they no longer produce automobiles. In 1973 a group of Avco executives purchased the Evendale, Ohio, operation of AVCO Electronics Division, a successor to one of Crosley&#x27;s business ventures, and renamed it the Cincinnati Electronics Corporation. The company manufactured a broad range of sophisticated electronic equipment for communications and space, infrared and radar, and electronic warfare, among others. Since its creation in 1973, Cincinnati Electronics has been acquired by a handful of companies, including GEC Marconi (1981), BAE Systems (1999), CMC Electronics (2001), L-3 Communications (2004–2019), and L3Harris (2019-present).

The present-day Crosley Corporation is not connected to the original Crosley. An independent appliance distributor formed the current company after purchasing the rights to the name from Avco in 1976. Its appliances are manufactured mostly in North America by Electrolux and Whirlpool Corporation. Crosley-branded, top-loading washing machines are made by the Whirlpool at its plant in Clyde, Ohio. In 1984, Modern Marketing Concepts, one of the leading U.S. manufacturers of vintage-styled turntables, radios, and other audio electronics, reintroduced Crosley brand name for its Crosley Radio.

Crosley&#x27;s automobiles and experimental military vehicles are in the collections of several museums. Crosleys are also sought-after vehicles by vintage auto collectors. The Crosley company&#x27;s Bonzo promotional items and Crosley Pup radios have become valuable as collectibles. A papier mâché Crosley Bonzo is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

The University of Cincinnati, where Crosley was a student, has named their building Crosley Tower after him.

<text>Paul Ackford (born 26 February 1958) is a former English rugby union international who played lock forward. He was formerly an inspector in the Metropolitan Police, and is now a columnist for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;.

==Early life==
Ackford was born in Hanover, West Germany.

==Education==
He was educated at Plymouth College, the University of Kent (BA) and Cambridge University (MA). He played lock for England B aged 21 and represented Cambridge in the 1979 Varsity Match, but did not make an impact until joining Harlequins and the Police in 1983.

==Career==
After impressing for the London Division against the touring Wallabies, he made his England debut on 5 November 1988 against Australia, aged 30.

Partnering police constable Wade Dooley, Ackford became an important part of the new side captained by Will Carling. He went on the 1989 British Lions tour to Australia, where he played in all three tests.

In 1990 he was knocked unconscious when blindsided by the young Argentine front row forward Federico Mendez, which saw Mendez sent off. Mendez later claimed it was a case of mistaken identity, and that he had meant to hit Jeff Probyn, because he had &quot;stamped on my goolies&quot;. Ackford was part of the England side that won the Five Nations Grand Slam in 1991. He retired from international rugby after the 1991 World Cup, won by Australia, becoming a journalist and writing for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;.

<text>Namhansanseong () is a historic Korean fortress city in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the fortress lies atop the mountain Namhansan and stretches 12 km in length. It served as an emergency capital city during the 1392–1910 Joseon period. The design is based on fortress architecture of East Asia, embodying aspects of four historical cultural styles: Joseon of Korea, the Azuchi-Momoyama Period of Japan, and Ming and Qing China.

It was extensively developed during the 16th to 18th centuries, a period of continuous warfare. The technical development of weaponry and armaments during this period, which saw the use of gunpowder imported from Europe, also greatly influenced the architecture and layout of the fortress. Namhansanseong portrays how the various theories of defense mechanisms in Korea were put to form by combining the everyday living environment with defense objectives. The fortress indicates how Buddhism played an influential role in protecting the state, and it became a symbol of sovereignty in Korea.

It can be accessed from Seoul through Namhansanseong station of Seoul Subway Line 8.

== History ==
Namhansanseong now lies atop the mountain Namhansan. This location made it highly defensible; even before the fortress&#x27;s construction, a number of defensive structures existed in the area. A 2005 archaeological dig found a fortress called Jujangseong that dated to the 57–935 Silla period. During the Goryeo period, a fortification existed in the area that was called &quot;Gwangju Fortress&quot; ().

The fortress&#x27;s construction was motivated by the 1624 Yi Gwal&#x27;s Rebellion and 1627 Later Jin invasion of Joseon. King Injo ordered to construct it. Buddhist monk-soldiers were recruited from all eight provinces for the task. Over time, features were continually added to the fortress; it eventually became the best-equipped in Korea. The fortress proper (excluding outermost walls) reached a circumference of . Its interior area was .

Namhansanseong was constructed as an emergency capital city during war, and administrative center during peace. It had an emergency palace for the king, military buildings, and accommodations for regular people. It was capable of housing around 4,000 people. Thus, both commoners and king were expected to live in the fortress, unlike in some European castles where commoners were made to live outside the fortifications.
The fortress played a role in a number of historic events. In the early 20th century, it was the site of battles between the righteous armies and the Japanese. In 1907, the Japanese destroyed much of the fortress, in order to decrease its utility to Koreans. The fortress lost its function as the town center due to the relocation of the Gwangju County Office in 1917, resulting in a downgrade to a remote mountain village. Then, the fortress suffered population loss and material loss during the 1950–1953 Korean War. Nowadays, Namhansanseong is a tourist attraction, after undergoing large-scale wall restorations and being designated as a provincial park since the 1970s. It has seen a dramatic increase in the number of restaurants and various visitor facilities since the 1980s. The Emergency Palace and the Royal Ancestral Shrine within the fortress have been actively restored based on various studies on Namhansanseong since the 1990s, and it was listed on the World Heritage tentative list in 2010. It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2014.

Since the 17th century, Namhansanseong has been managed and preserved by the residents for generations. Most fortress towns in Korea underwent severe deformation and change during Japanese colonial times and the period of industrialization and urbanization, resulting in losing their original layout and forms. However, Namhansanseong retained its original layout because the Japanese colonial government relocated the administrative functions and demolished its military functions in the earlier stage of colonization, leaving it as an isolated mountain village thereafter.

== Conservation management ==
The Namhansanseong World Heritage Centre is responsible for managing and monitoring the cultural heritage of Namhansanseong, while the Namhansanseong Provincial Park Office is responsible for managing and monitoring visitor facilities within Namhansanseong and the provincial park area, in accordance with the 2012 Basic Plan on Comprehensive Improvement of Namhansanseong.

== Protection and management requirements ==

Namhansanseong is protected under the Cultural Heritage Protection Act (CHP Act) and the Natural Park Act on the national level. There are also specific ordinances and regulations at the province and city levels. On the basis of the CHP Act, the entire property is designated as a historic site and has a buffer zone surrounding the area with limitations and regulations on development and construction. The entire heritage and buffer zone is also protected as a Provincial Park covering a wider area. Under these frameworks, a Conservation Management Plan has been established to ensure the long-term protection of the fortress and the town within. A special independent entity called the Namhansanseong World Heritage Centre is responsible for the overall management of its heritage in cooperation with the Namhansanseong Provincial Park Office, the residents, local governments, experts and the central government.

Financial support comes from the national and provincial governments, and the projects are managed and operated by the Namhansanseong World Heritage Centre. A monitoring system controls the appropriate use and execution of financial resources and proposed plans.

The current status of conservation can be evaluated in three components called the military component, the governing component, and the folk component. The military component includes the fortress walls and structures, outer walls, Chimgwaejeong Arsenal, and Buddhist temples. The governing component comprises Jwajeon Shrine, Usil Shrine site, the Emergency Palace, Jwaseungdang Hall and the site of Inhwagwan Guest house. The folk component includes steles, pavilions, and intangible heritage such as rituals and rites. All these subcomponents are recorded and are managed appropriately for the form and type of heritage.

Threats to preservation of the site include developmental pressures, environmental pressures, natural disasters, risk preparedness, visitor pressure and land use. Development pressures are relatively low for Namhansanseong as the property area and buffer zones are effectively controlled by the CHP Act, the Natural Park Act and urban management planning. Visitor pressure is perhaps the highest risk factor in Namhansanseong. For the sustainable conservation of the fortress areas, preventive measures include studies on carrying capacity, regular estimation of expected visitors, and utilizing planning mechanisms with legal instruments.

<text>The Dukedom of Inverness was first created a title in the Jacobite Peerage of Great Britain, and as such was not recognised by the government or monarch or Great Britain. Its only holder was John Hay of Cromlix.

In 1840 Lady Cecilia Underwood was created the Duchess of Inverness in her own right. She was the second wife of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, Earl of Inverness, the sixth son of King George III. Their marriage was deemed illegal because of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, so Cecilia was never recognized as Duchess of Sussex or a British princess. Instead, Queen Victoria created Cecilia Duchess of Inverness with remainder to the heirs male of her body lawfully begotten. The title became extinct upon her death in 1873.

<text>Active measures () is a term used to describe political warfare conducted by the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation. The term, which dates back to the 1920s, includes operations such as espionage, propaganda, sabotage and assassination, based on foreign policy objectives of the Soviet and Russian governments. Active measures have continued to be used by the administration of Vladimir Putin.

==Description==
Active measures were conducted by the Soviet and Russian security services and secret police organizations (Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, KGB, and FSB) to influence the course of world events, in addition to collecting intelligence and producing revised assessments of it. Active measures range &quot;from media manipulations to &quot;special actions&quot; involving various degrees of violence&quot;. Beginning in the 1920s, they were used both abroad and domestically.

Active measures includes the establishment and support of international front organizations (e.g., the World Peace Council); foreign communist, socialist and opposition parties; wars of national liberation in the Third World. It also included supporting underground, revolutionary, insurgency, criminal, and terrorist groups. The programs also focused on counterfeiting official documents, assassinations, and political repression, such as penetration into churches, and persecution of political dissidents. The intelligence agencies of Eastern Bloc states also contributed to the program, providing operatives and intelligence for assassinations and other types of covert operations.

Retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin, former head of Foreign Counter Intelligence for the KGB (1973–1979), described active measures as &quot;the heart and soul of the Soviet intelligence&quot;:

Not intelligence collection, but subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs.

According to the Mitrokhin Archives, active measures was taught in the Andropov Institute of the KGB situated at Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) headquarters in Yasenevo District of Moscow. The head of the &quot;active measures department&quot; was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge Five spy ring.

== History ==
Defector Ion Mihai Pacepa claimed that Joseph Stalin coined the term &quot;disinformation&quot; in 1923 by giving it a French sounding name in order to deceive other nations into believing it was a practice invented in France. The noun &quot;disinformation&quot; does not originate from Russia, it is a translation of the French word .

== Implementation ==
=== Guerrillas ===
==== Promotion of guerrilla and terrorist organizations worldwide ====

Soviet secret services have been described as &quot;the primary instructors of guerrillas worldwide&quot;. According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, KGB General Aleksandr Sakharovsky once said: &quot;In today&#x27;s world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.&quot; He also claimed that &quot;Airplane hijacking is my own invention&quot;. In 1969 alone, 82 planes were hijacked worldwide by the KGB-financed PLO.

Lt. General Ion Mihai Pacepa stated that operation &quot;SIG&quot; (&quot;Zionist Governments&quot;), devised in 1972, intended to turn the whole Islamic world against Israel and the United States. KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov allegedly explained to Pacepa that

a billion adversaries could inflict far greater damage on America than could a few millions. We needed to instill a Nazi-style hatred for the Jews throughout the Islamic world, and to turn this weapon of the emotions into a terrorist bloodbath against Israel and its main supporter, the United States

=== Installing and undermining governments ===
After World War II, Soviet security organizations played a key role in installing puppet communist governments in Eastern Europe, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, North Korea, and later Afghanistan. Their strategy included mass political repressions and establishment of subordinate secret services in all occupied countries.

Some of the active measures were undertaken by the Soviet secret services against their own governments or communist rulers. Russian historians Anton Antonov-Ovseenko and Edvard Radzinsky suggested that Joseph Stalin was killed by associates of NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria, based on the interviews of a former Stalin bodyguard and circumstantial evidence. According to Yevgenia Albats&#x27; allegations, Chief of the KGB Vladimir Semichastny was among the plotters against Nikita Khrushchev in 1964, which led to the latter&#x27;s downfall.

KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov reportedly struggled for power with Leonid Brezhnev. The Soviet coup attempt of 1991 against Mikhail Gorbachev was organized by KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov and other hardliners. Gen. Viktor Barannikov, then the former State Security head, became one of the leaders of the uprising against Boris Yeltsin during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993.

The current Russian intelligence service, the SVR, allegedly works to undermine governments of former Soviet satellite states like Poland, the Baltic states, and Georgia. During the 2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy, several Russian GRU case officers were accused by Georgian authorities of preparations to commit sabotage and terrorist acts.

=== Political assassinations ===
The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa claimed to have had a conversation with Nicolae Ceaușescu, who told him about &quot;ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill&quot;: László Rajk and Imre Nagy from Hungary; Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej from Romania; Rudolf Slánský and Jan Masaryk from Czechoslovakia; the Shah of Iran; Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, President of Pakistan; Palmiro Togliatti from Italy; John F. Kennedy; and Mao Zedong. Pacepa also discussed a KGB plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organized by the Soviet intelligence agencies and alleged that &quot;among the leaders of Moscow&#x27;s satellite intelligence services there was unanimous agreement that the KGB had been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.&quot;

The second President of Afghanistan, Hafizullah Amin, was killed by the KGB&#x27;s Alpha Group in Operation Storm-333 before the full-scale Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Presidents of the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria organized by Chechen separatists, including Dzhokhar Dudaev, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, Aslan Maskhadov, and Abdul-Khalim Saidullaev, were killed by the FSB and affiliated forces.

Other widely publicized cases are murders of Russian communist Leon Trotsky and Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov by NKVD.

There were also allegations that the KGB was behind the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II in 1981. The Italian Mitrokhin Commission, headed by senator Paolo Guzzanti (Forza Italia), worked on the Mitrokhin Archives from 2003 to March 2006. The Mitrokhin Commission received criticism during and after its existence. It was closed in March 2006 without any proof brought to its various controversial allegations, including the claim that Romano Prodi, former Prime Minister of Italy and former President of the European Commission, was the &quot;KGB&#x27;s man in Europe.&quot; One of Guzzanti&#x27;s informers, Mario Scaramella, was arrested for defamation and arms trading at the end of 2006.

=== Puppet rebel forces ===
==== Operation Trust ====
In &quot;Operation Trust&quot; (1921–1926), the State Political Directorate (OGPU) set up a fake anti-Bolshevik underground organization, &quot;Monarchist Union of Central Russia&quot;. The main success of this operation was luring Boris Savinkov and Sidney Reilly into the Soviet Union, where they were arrested and executed.

==== Basmachi Revolt ====

The Islamic anti-Soviet Basmachi movement in Central Asia posed an early threat to the Bolshevik movement. The movement&#x27;s roots lay in the anti-conscription violence of 1916 that erupted when the Russian Empire began to draft Muslims for army service in World War I. In the months following the October Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power in many parts of the Russian Empire and the Russian Civil War began. Turkestani Muslim political movements attempted to form an autonomous government in the city of Kokand, in the Fergana Valley. The Bolsheviks launched an assault on Kokand in February 1918 and carried out a general massacre of up to 25,000 people. The massacre rallied support to the Basmachi who waged a guerrilla and conventional war that seized control of large parts of the Fergana Valley and much of Turkestan. The group&#x27;s notable leaders were Enver Pasha and, later, Ibrahim Bek. Soviet Russia responded by deploying special Soviet military detachments masqueraded as Basmachi forces and received support from British and Turkish intelligence services. The operations of these detachments facilitated the collapse of the Basmachi movement and the assassination of Pasha.

==== Post World War II counter-insurgency operations ====
Following World War II, various partisan organizations in the Baltic states, Poland and Western Ukraine fought for independence of their countries, which were under Soviet occupation, against Soviet forces. Many NKVD agents were sent to join and penetrate the independence movements. Puppet rebel forces were also created by the NKVD and permitted to attack local Soviet authorities to gain credibility and exfiltrate senior NKVD agents to the West.

=== Supporting political movements ===
According to Stanislav Lunev, GRU alone spent more than $1 billion for the peace movements against the Vietnam War, which was a &quot;hugely successful campaign and well worth the cost&quot;. Lunev claimed that &quot;the GRU and the KGB helped to fund just about every antiwar movement and organization in America and abroad&quot;.

By the 1980s, the US intelligence community was skeptical of claims that attempted Soviet influence on the peace movement had a direct influence on the non-aligned part of the movement. However, the KGB&#x27;s widespread attempts at influence in the United States, Switzerland, and Denmark targeting the peace movement were known, and the World Peace Council was categorized as a communist front organization by the CIA.

The World Peace Council was established on the orders of the Communist Party of the USSR in the late 1940s, and for over forty years carried out campaigns against western, mainly American, military action. Many organisations controlled or influenced by Communists affiliated themselves with it. According to Oleg Kalugin,

... the Soviet intelligence [was] really unparalleled. ... The [KGB] programs—which would run all sorts of congresses, peace congresses, youth congresses, festivals, women&#x27;s movements, trade union movements, campaigns against U.S. missiles in Europe, campaigns against neutron weapons, allegations that AIDS ... was invented by the CIA ... all sorts of forgeries and faked material—[were] targeted at politicians, the academic community, at [the] public at large. ...

It has been widely claimed that the Soviet Union organised and financed western peace movements; for example, ex-KGB agent Sergei Tretyakov claimed that in the early 1980s the KGB wanted to prevent the United States from deploying nuclear missiles in Western Europe as a counterweight to Soviet missiles in Eastern Europe, and that they used the Soviet Peace Committee to organize and finance anti-American demonstrations in western Europe. The Soviet Union first deployed the RSD-10 Pioneer (called &quot;SS-20 Saber&quot; in the West) in its European territories in March 1976, a mobile, concealable intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) containing three nuclear 150-kiloton warheads. The SS-20&#x27;s range of was great enough to reach Western Europe from well within Soviet territory; the range was just below the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) Treaty minimum range for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).. Tretyakov made further stated that &quot;[t]he KGB was responsible for creating the entire nuclear winter story to stop the Pershing II missiles,&quot; and that they fed misinformation to western peace groups and thereby influenced a key scientific paper on the topic by western scientists.

According to intelligence historian Christopher Andrew, the KGB in Britain was unable to infiltrate major figures in the CND, and the Soviets relied on influencing &quot;less influential contacts&quot; which were more receptive to the Moscow line. Andrew wrote that MI5 &quot;found no evidence that KGB funding to the British peace movement went beyond occasional payment of fares and expenses to individuals.&quot;

=== United States ===

Some of the active measures by the USSR against the United States were exposed in the Mitrokhin Archive:

* Attempts to discredit the Central Intelligence Agency, using writer Philip Agee (codenamed PONT), who exposed the identities of many CIA personnel. Mitrokhin alleges that Agee&#x27;s bulletin &quot;CovertAction&quot; received assistance from the Soviet KGB and Cuban DGI
* Stirring up racial tensions in the United States by mailing bogus letters from the Ku Klux Klan, placing an explosive package in &quot;the Negro section of New York&quot; (Operation PANDORA)
* Planting claims that both John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated by the CIA
* In the Middle East in 1975, the KGB claimed to identify 45 statesmen from around the world who had been the victims of successful or unsuccessful CIA assassination attempts over the past decade
* Make US military aid to the El Salvador government (increased more than fivefold by the Reagan administration between 1981 and 1984) so unpopular within the United States that public opinion would demand that it be halted. About 150 committees were created in the United States which spoke out against US interference in El Salvador, and contacts were made with US Senators
* Starting rumors that fluoridated drinking water was in fact a plot by the US government to maintain population control
* Fabrication of the story that the AIDS virus was manufactured by US scientists at Fort Detrick; the story was spread by Russian-born biologist Jakob Segal. In a secondary role to the KGB during the operation, former East German spymaster Markus Wolf admitted, during a visit to Italy in 1998, the role of the HVA in spreading AIDS conspiracy theories

In 1974, according to KGB statistics, over 250 active measures were targeted against the CIA alone, leading to denunciations of Agency abuses, both real and (more frequently) imaginary, in media, parliamentary debates, demonstrations and speeches by leading politicians around the world.

=== Blowback ===
Soviet intelligence, as part of active measures, frequently spread disinformation to distort their adversaries&#x27; decision-making. However, sometimes this information filtered back through the KGB&#x27;s own contacts, leading to distorted reports. Lawrence Bittman also addressed Soviet intelligence blowback in &quot;The KGB and Soviet Disinformation&quot;, stating that &quot;There are, of course, instances in which the operator is partially or completely exposed and subjected to countermeasures taken by the government of the target country.&quot;

== Russian Federation active measures, 1991 to present ==

Active measures have continued in the post-Soviet Russian Federation and are in many ways based on Cold War schematics. After the annexation of Crimea, Kremlin-controlled media spread disinformation about Ukraine&#x27;s government. In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a Russian missile over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers. Kremlin-controlled media and online agents spread disinformation, claiming Ukraine had shot down the airplane.

Russia&#x27;s alleged disinformation campaign, its involvement in the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU, interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, and its alleged support of far-left and documented support of far-right movements in the West, has been compared to the Soviet Union&#x27;s active measures in that it aims to &quot;disrupt and discredit Western democracies&quot;.

In testimony before the United States Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the US policy response to Russian interference in the 2016 elections, Victoria Nuland, former US Ambassador to NATO, referred to herself as &quot;a regular target of Russian active measures.&quot;

The introduction of the Internet, specifically social media offered new opportunities for active measures. The Kremlin-affiliated Internet Research Agency, also referred to as the Information Warfare Branch, was established in 2013. This agency is devoted to spreading disinformation through the Internet, the most well-known and prominent operation being its part in the interference in the 2016 US presidential election. According to the House Intelligence Committee, by 2018, organic content created by the Russian IRA reached at least 126 million US Facebook users, while its politically divisive ads reached 11.4 million US Facebook users. Tweets by the IRA reached approximately 288 million American users. According to committee chair Adam Schiff, &quot;[The Russian] social media campaign was designed to further a broader Kremlin objective: sowing discord in the U.S. by inflaming passions on a range of divisive issues. The Russians did so by weaving together fake accounts, pages, and communities to push politicized content and videos, and to mobilize real Americans to sign online petitions and join rallies and protests.&quot;

<doc id="797137" wikidata="Q147877" url="?curid=797137" title="Polyphaga">
<text>Polyphaga is the largest and most diverse suborder of beetles. It comprises 144 families in 16 superfamilies, and displays an enormous variety of specialization and adaptation, with over 350,000 described species, or approximately 90% of the beetle species discovered thus far.

Key characteristics of Polyphaga are that the hind coxa (base of the leg) does not divide the first and second abdominal/ventral plates which are known as sternites. Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present.

==Etymology==
The name of &quot;polyphaga&quot; is derived from two Greek words: , meaning &#x27;many&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;to eat&#x27;, so the suborder is called the “eaters of many things”.

==Classification==
The five main infraorders are:

* Bostrichiformia — including furniture beetles and skin beetles
* Cucujiformia — includes lady beetles, longhorn beetles, weevils, checkered beetles and leaf beetles
* Elateriformia — includes click beetles and fireflies
* Scarabaeiformia — includes scarab beetles, stag beetles, and dung beetles
* Staphyliniformia — includes rove beetles and water scavenger beetles
Phylogenetic studies have also suggested that Scirtoidea (Scirtidae, Decliniidae), Clamboidea (Clambidae, Derodontidae, Eucinetidae), &quot;Rhinorhipus&quot; and Nosodendridae are independent lineages of Polyphaga that lie outside these groups.

The internal classification of Polyphaga involves several superfamilies or series, whose constituents are relatively stable, although some smaller families (whose rank even is disputed) are allocated to different clades by different authors. Large superfamilies include Hydrophiloidea, Staphylinoidea, Scarabaeoidea, Buprestoidea, Byrrhoidea, Elateroidea, and Bostrichoidea.

The infraorder Cucujiformia includes the vast majority of phytophagous (plant-eating) beetles, united by cryptonephric Malpighian tubules of the normal type, a cone ommatidium with open rhabdom, and lack of functional spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment. Constituent superfamilies of Cucujiformia are Cleroidea, Cucujoidea, Tenebrionoidea, Chrysomeloidea, and Curculionoidea. Evidently adoption of a phytophagous lifestyle correlates with taxon diversity in beetles, with Cucujiformia, especially weevils (Curculionoidea), forming a major radiation.

<text>Solo was a debit card in the United Kingdom introduced as a sister to the then existing Switch. (Later merged with the Maestro debit card brand of the Mastercard corporation) Launched on 1 July 1997, by the Switch Card Scheme, it was designed for use on deposit accounts, as well as by customers who did not qualify for a Switch card (or, later, Maestro card) on current accounts, such as teenagers. The Solo card scheme was decommissioned permanently on 31 March 2011.

==Operation==
Solo was issued as a multifunction cash card by NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland to customers over the age of 11 and by HSBC Bank (formerly Midland Bank) to customers over the age of 13; however, NatWest Group and HSBC both then issued Visa Debit cards in place of Solo. Like its main rival, Visa Electron, Solo cards required all transactions receive electronic authorisation from the issuing bank.

Such authorisation would not be given if there were insufficient cleared funds in the cardholder&#x27;s account. Solo cards were linked to the Switch processing system (later re-branded as Maestro); however, some merchants differentiated between Solo and Switch through their numbering scheme to prevent under 18s from purchasing online.

Due to their availability to minors, they could be used as a simple age vetting mechanism; for example, when online grocers Ocado accepted Solo, they refused to sell razor blades or alcoholic beverages to those paying with the card. Solo cards were also issued to people with a bad credit history to reduce the liability for the issuing bank.

<doc id="797150" wikidata="Q184661" url="?curid=797150" title="Ogham">
<text>Ogham (also ogam and ogom, , ; , later ) is an Early Medieval alphabet used primarily to write the early Irish language (in the &quot;orthodox&quot; inscriptions, 4th to 6th centuries AD), and later the Old Irish language (scholastic ogham, 6th to 9th centuries). There are roughly 400 surviving orthodox inscriptions on stone monuments throughout Ireland and western Britain, the bulk of which are in southern areas of the Irish province of Munster. The Munster counties of Cork and Kerry contain 60% of all Irish ogham stones. The largest number outside Ireland are in Pembrokeshire, Wales.

The inscriptions usually consist of personal names written in a set formula.

Many of the High Medieval &quot;Bríatharogaim&quot; (kennings for the ogham letters) are understood to reference various trees and plants. This interpretation was popularized by Robert Graves in his book &quot;The White Goddess&quot;; for this reason, Ogham is sometimes known as the Celtic tree alphabet.

The etymology of the word &quot;ogam&quot; or &quot;ogham&quot; remains unclear. One possible origin is from the Irish &quot;og-úaim&quot; &#x27;point-seam&#x27;, referring to the seam made by the point of a sharp weapon.

==Origins==
It is generally thought that the earliest inscriptions in Ogham date to about the 4th century AD, but James Carney believed its origin is rather within the 1st century BC. Although the use of classical ogham in stone inscriptions seems to have flourished in the 5th and 6th centuries around the Irish Sea, from the phonological evidence it is clear that the alphabet predates the 5th century. Indeed, the alphabet has letters representing archaic phonemes which were clearly part of the system, but which were no longer spoken by the 5th century and never appear in inscriptions, suggesting an extended period of ogham writing on wood or other perishable material prior to the preserved monumental inscriptions. They are: &quot;úath&quot; (&quot;H&quot;) and &quot;straif&quot; (&quot;Z&quot; in the manuscript tradition, but probably &quot;F&quot; from &quot;SW&quot;), and &quot;gétal&quot; (velar nasal &quot;NG&quot; in the manuscript tradition, but etymologically probably &quot;GW&quot;). 

It appears that the Ogham alphabet was modelled on another script, and some even consider it a mere cipher of its template script (Düwel 1968: points out similarity with ciphers of Germanic runes). The largest number of scholars favour the Latin alphabet as this template, although the Elder Futhark and even the Greek alphabet have their supporters. Runic origin would elegantly explain the presence of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; letters unused in Irish, as well as the presence of vocalic and consonantal variants &quot;U&quot; vs. &quot;W&quot;, unknown to Latin writing and lost in Greek (cf. digamma). The Latin alphabet is the primary contender mainly because its influence at the required period (4th century) is most easily established, being widely used in neighbouring Roman Britannia, while runes in the 4th century were not very widespread even in continental Europe.

In Ireland and Wales, the language of the monumental stone inscriptions is termed Primitive Irish. The transition to Old Irish, the language of the earliest sources in the Latin alphabet, takes place in about the 6th century. Since ogham inscriptions consist almost exclusively of personal names and marks possibly indicating land ownership, linguistic information that may be gleaned from the Primitive Irish period is mostly restricted to phonological developments.

===Theories of origin===

There are two main schools of thought among scholars as to the motivation for the creation of ogham. Scholars such as Carney and MacNeill have suggested that ogham was first created as a cryptic alphabet, designed by the Irish to hide their meaning from writers of the Latin alphabet. In this school of thought, it is asserted that &quot;the alphabet was created by Irish scholars or druids for political, military or religious reasons to provide a secret means of communication in opposition to the authorities of Roman Britain.&quot; The serious threat of invasion by the Roman Empire, which then ruled over neighbouring southern Britain, may have spurred the creation of the alphabet. Alternatively, in later centuries when the threat of invasion had receded and the Irish were themselves invading western Britain, the desire to keep communications secret from Romans or Romanised Britons would still have provided an incentive. With bilingual ogham and Latin inscriptions in Wales, however, one would suppose that the ogham could easily be decoded by at least an educated few in the post-Roman world.

The second main school of thought, put forward by scholars such as McManus, is that ogham was invented by the first Christian communities in early Ireland, out of a desire for a unique alphabet to write short messages and inscriptions in Irish. The sounds of Primitive Irish may have been difficult to transcribe into the Latin alphabet, motivating the invention of a separate alphabet. A possible such origin, as suggested by McManus (1991:41), is the early Irish Christian community known from around AD 400 at latest, attested by the mission of Palladius by Pope Celestine I in AD 431.

A variation is the idea that this alphabet was first invented, for whatever reason, in 4th-century Irish settlements in west Wales after contact and intermarriage with Romanised Britons with knowledge of the Latin alphabet. In fact, several ogham stones in Wales are bilingual, containing both Irish and British Latin, testifying to the international contacts that led to the existence of some of these stones.

A third hypothesis, put forward by the noted ogham scholar R. A. S. Macalister was influential at one time, but finds little favour with scholars today. He believed – because ogham consists of four groups of five letters with a sequence of strokes from one to five – that ogham was first invented as a secret system of finger signals in Cisalpine Gaul around 600 BC by Gaulish druids, and was inspired by a form of the Greek alphabet current in Northern Italy at the time. According to this idea, the alphabet was transmitted in oral form or on wood only, until it was finally put into a permanent form on stone inscriptions in early Christian Ireland. Later scholars are largely united in rejecting this hypothesis, however, primarily because a detailed study of the letters shows that they were created specifically for the Primitive Irish of the early centuries AD. The supposed links with the form of the Greek alphabet that Macalister proposed can also be disproved.

A fourth hypothesis, proposed by the scholars Rudolf Thurneysen and Joseph Vendryes, is that the forms of the letters derive from a numerical tally-mark counting system of the time, based around the numbers five and twenty, which was then adapted into an alphabet.

===Legendary accounts===
According to the 11th-century &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, the 14th-century &quot;Auraicept na n-Éces&quot;, and other Medieval Irish folklore, ogham was first invented soon after the fall of the Tower of Babel, along with the Gaelic language, by the legendary Scythian king, Fenius Farsa. According to the Auraicept, Fenius journeyed from Scythia together with Goídel mac Ethéoir, Íar mac Nema and a retinue of 72 scholars. They came to the plain of Shinar to study the confused languages at Nimrod&#x27;s tower (the Tower of Babel). Finding that they had already been dispersed, Fenius sent his scholars to study them, staying at the tower, coordinating the effort. After ten years, the investigations were complete, and Fenius created &quot;in Bérla tóbaide&quot; &quot;the selected language&quot;, taking the best of each of the confused tongues, which he called &quot;Goídelc&quot;, Goidelic, after Goídel mac Ethéoir. He also created extensions of &quot;Goídelc&quot;, called &quot;Bérla Féne&quot;, after himself, &quot;Íarmberla&quot;, after Íar mac Nema, and others, and the &quot;Beithe-luis-nuin&quot; (the ogham) as a perfected writing system for his languages. The names he gave to the letters were those of his 25 best scholars.

Alternatively, the Ogam Tract credits Ogma with the script&#x27;s invention. Ogma was skilled in speech and poetry, and created the system for the learned, to confound rustics and fools. The first message written in ogam was seven &quot;b&quot; on a birch, sent as a warning to Lug, meaning: &quot;your wife will be carried away seven times to the otherworld unless the birch protects her&quot;. For this reason, the letter &quot;b&quot; is said to be named after the birch, and &quot;In Lebor Ogaim&quot; goes on to tell the tradition that all letters were named after trees, a claim also referred to by the Auraicept as an alternative to the naming after Fenius&#x27; disciples.

==Alphabet: the Beith-luis-nin==

Strictly speaking, the word &quot;ogham&quot; means &quot;letters&quot;, while the alphabet is called &quot;beith-luis-nin&quot; after the letter names of the first letters (in the same way that the modern word &quot;alphabet&quot; derives from the Greek letters &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot;). The order of the first five letters, BLFSN, led the scholar Macalister to propose that a link between a form of the Greek alphabet used in Northern Italy in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. However, there is no evidence for Macalister&#x27;s theory, and it has been discounted by later scholars. There are in fact other explanations for the name &quot;Beith-luis-nin&quot;. One explanation is that the word &quot;nin&quot;, which means &quot;forked branch&quot;, was used to mean letters in general. &quot;Beith-luis-nin&quot; could therefore mean simply &quot;beith-luis&quot; letters. Another suggestion is that &quot;beith-luis-nin&quot; is a contraction of the first five letters, ie, &quot;beith-LVS-nin&quot;.

The ogham alphabet originally consisted of twenty letters, divided into four groups () according the stroke angle and direction. The groups were
*, right side/downward strokes
*, left side/upward strokes
*, oblique crossing strokes
*, notches or perpendicular crossing strokes

Five additional letters were later introduced (mainly in the manuscript tradition), the so-called &quot;forfeda&quot;.

A letter for &quot;p&quot; is conspicuously absent, since the phoneme was lost in Proto-Celtic, and the gap was not filled in Q-Celtic, and no sign was needed before loanwords from Latin containing &quot;p&quot; appeared in Irish (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Patrick). Conversely, there is a letter for the labiovelar &quot;q&quot; (ᚊ &quot;ceirt&quot;), a phoneme lost in Old Irish. The base alphabet is, therefore, as it were, designed for Proto-Q-Celtic.

Of the five &quot;forfeda&quot; or supplementary letters, only the first, &quot;ébad&quot;, regularly appears in inscriptions, but mostly with the value K (McManus, § 5.3, 1991), in the word &quot;koi&quot; (ᚕᚑᚔ &quot;here&quot;). The others, except for &quot;emancholl&quot;, have at most only one certain &#x27;orthodox&#x27; (see below) inscription each. Due to their limited practical use, later ogamists turned the supplementary letters into a series of diphthongs, changing completely the values for &quot;pín&quot; and &quot;emancholl&quot;. This meant that the alphabet was once again without a letter for the &#x27;P&#x27; sound, forcing the invention of the letter &quot;peithboc&quot; (soft &#x27;B&#x27;), which appears in the manuscripts only.

===Letter names===

The letter names are interpreted as names of trees or shrubs in manuscript tradition, both in &quot;Auraicept na n-Éces&quot; (&#x27;The Scholars&#x27; Primer&#x27;) and &quot;In Lebor Ogaim&quot; (&#x27;The Ogam Tract&#x27;). They were first discussed in modern times by Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh (1685), who took them at face value. The Auraicept itself is aware that not all names are known tree names: &quot;Now all these are wood names such as are found in the &quot;Ogham Book of Woods,&quot; and are not derived from men&quot;, admitting that &quot;some of these trees are not known today&quot;. The Auraicept gives a short phrase or kenning for each letter, known as a &quot;Bríatharogam&quot;, that traditionally accompanied each letter name, and a further gloss explaining their meanings and identifying the tree or plant linked to each letter. Only five of the twenty primary letters have tree names that the Auraicept considers comprehensible without further glosses, namely &quot;beith&quot; &quot;birch&quot;, &quot;fearn&quot; &quot;alder&quot;, &quot;saille&quot; &quot;willow&quot;, &quot;duir&quot; &quot;oak&quot; and &quot;coll&quot; &quot;hazel&quot;. All the other names have to be glossed or &quot;translated&quot;.

According to the leading modern ogham scholar, Damian McManus, the &quot;Tree Alphabet&quot; idea dates to the Old Irish period (say, 10th century), but it postdates the Primitive Irish period, or at least the time when the letters were originally named. Its origin is probably due to the letters themselves being called &quot;feda&quot; &quot;trees&quot;, or &quot;nin&quot; &quot;forking branches&quot; due to their shape. Since a few of the letters were, in fact, named after trees, the interpretation arose that they were called &quot;feda&quot; because of that. Some of the other letter names had fallen out of use as independent words, and were thus free to be claimed as &quot;Old Gaelic&quot; tree names, while others (such as &quot;ruis&quot;, &quot;úath&quot; or &quot;gort&quot;) were more or less forcefully reinterpreted as epithets of trees by the medieval glossators.

McManus (1991, §3.15) discusses possible etymologies of all the letter names, and as well as the five mentioned above, he adds one other definite tree name: &quot;onn&quot; &quot;ash&quot; (the Auraicept wrongly has &quot;furze&quot;). McManus (1988, p. 164) also believes that the name &quot;idad&quot; is probably an artificial form of &quot;iubhar&quot; &quot;yew&quot;, as the kennings support that meaning, and concedes that &quot;ailm&quot; may possibly mean &quot;pine tree,&quot; as it appears to be used to mean that in an 8th-century poem. Thus out of twenty letter names, only eight at most are the names of trees. The other names have a variety of meanings.

*Beith, Old Irish Beithe means &quot;birch-tree&quot;, cognate to Middle Welsh &quot;bedw&quot;. Latin &quot;betula&quot; is considered a borrowing from the Gaulish cognate.
*Luis, Old Irish Luis is either related to &quot;luise&quot; &quot;blaze&quot; or &quot;lus&quot; &quot;herb&quot;. The arboreal tradition has &quot;caertheand&quot; &quot;rowan&quot;.
*Fearn, Old Irish Fern means &quot;alder-tree&quot;, Primitive Irish &quot;*wernā&quot;, so that the original value of the letter was .
*Sail, Old Irish Sail means &quot;willow-tree&quot;, cognate to Latin &quot;salix&quot;.
*Nion, Old Irish Nin means either &quot;fork&quot; or &quot;loft&quot;. The arboreal tradition has &quot;uinnius&quot; &quot;ash-tree&quot;.
*Uath, Old Irish Úath means &quot;úath&quot; &quot;horror, fear&quot;; the arboreal tradition has &quot;white-thorn&quot;. The original etymology of the name, and the letter&#x27;s value, are however unclear. McManus (1986) suggested a value . Peter Schrijver (see McManus 1991:37) suggested that if &quot;úath&quot; &quot;fear&quot; is cognate with Latin &quot;pavere&quot;, a trace of PIE &quot;*p&quot; might have survived into Primitive Irish, but there is no independent evidence for this.
*Dair, Old Irish Dair means &quot;oak&quot; (PIE &quot;*doru-&quot;).
*Tinne, Old Irish Tinne from the evidence of the kennings means &quot;bar of metal, ingot&quot;. The arboreal tradition has &quot;cuileand&quot; &quot;holly&quot;.
*Coll, Old Irish Coll meant &quot;hazel-tree&quot;, cognate with Welsh &quot;collen&quot;, correctly glossed as &quot;cainfidh&quot; &quot;fair-wood&quot; (&quot;hazel&quot;) by the arboreal interpretation. Latin &quot;corulus&quot; or &quot;corylus&quot; is cognate.
*Ceirt, Old Irish Cert is cognate with Welsh &quot;perth&quot; &quot;bush&quot;, Latin &quot;quercus&quot; &quot;oak&quot; (PIE &quot;*perkwos&quot;). It was confused with Old Irish &quot;ceirt&quot; &quot;rag&quot;, reflected in the kennings. The Auraicept glosses &quot;aball&quot; &quot;apple&quot;.
*Muin, Old Irish Muin: the kennings connect this name to three different words, &quot;muin&quot; &quot;neck, upper part of the back&quot;, &quot;muin&quot; &quot;wile, ruse&quot;, and &quot;muin&quot; &quot;love, esteem&quot;. The arboreal tradition has &quot;finemhain&quot; &quot;vine&quot;.
*Gort, Old Irish Gort means &quot;field&quot; (cognate to &quot;garden&quot;). The arboreal tradition has &quot;edind&quot; &quot;ivy&quot;.
*nGéadal, Old Irish Gétal from the kennings has a meaning of &quot;killing&quot;, maybe cognate to &quot;gonid&quot; &quot;slays&quot;, from PIE &quot;&quot;. The value of the letter in Primitive Irish, then, was a voiced labiovelar, . The arboreal tradition glosses &quot;cilcach&quot;, &quot;broom&quot; or &quot;fern&quot;.
*Straif, Old Irish Straiph means &quot;sulphur&quot;. The Primitive Irish letter value is uncertain, it may have been a sibilant different from &quot;s&quot;, which is taken by &quot;sail&quot;, maybe a reflex of or . The arboreal tradition glosses &quot;draighin&quot; &quot;blackthorn&quot;.
*Ruis, Old Irish Ruis means &quot;red&quot; or &quot;redness&quot;, glossed as &quot;trom&quot; &quot;elder&quot;.
*Ailm, Old Irish Ailm is of uncertain meaning, possibly &quot;pine-tree&quot;. The Auraicept has &quot;crand giuis .i. ochtach&quot;, &quot;fir-tree&quot; or &quot;pinetree&quot;.
*Onn, Old Irish Onn means &quot;ash-tree&quot;, although the Auraicept glosses &quot;aiten&quot; &quot;furze&quot;.
*Úr, Old Irish Úr, based on the kennings, means &quot;earth, clay, soil&quot;. The Auraicept glosses &quot;fraech&quot; &quot;heath&quot;.
*Eadhadh, Old Irish Edad of unknown meaning. The Auraicept glosses &quot;crand fir no crithach&quot; &quot;test-tree or aspen&quot;
*Iodhadh, Old Irish Idad is of uncertain meaning, but is probably a form of &quot;ibhar&quot; &quot;yew&quot;, which is the meaning given to it in the arboreal tradition.

*Eabhadh, Old Irish Ebhadh with &quot;crithach&quot; &quot;aspen&quot;;
*Ór, &quot;gold&quot; (from Latin aurum); the arboreal tradition has &quot;feorus no edind&quot;, &quot;spindle tree or ivy&quot;

*Pín, later Ifín, Old Irish Iphin with &quot;spinan no ispin&quot; &quot;gooseberry or thorn&quot;.

The fifth letter is &quot;emancholl&quot; which means &#x27;twin of hazel&#x27;

==Corpus==
Monumental ogham inscriptions are found in Ireland and Wales, with a few additional specimens found in southwest England (Devon and Cornwall), the Isle of Man, and Scotland, including Shetland and a single example from Silchester and another from Coventry in England. They were mainly employed as territorial markers and memorials (grave stones). The stone commemorating Vortiporius, a 6th-century king of Dyfed (originally located in Clynderwen), is the only ogham stone inscription that bears the name of an identifiable individual. The language of the inscriptions is predominantly Primitive Irish; the few inscriptions in Scotland, such as the Lunnasting stone, record fragments of what is probably the Pictish language.

The more ancient examples are standing stones, where the script was carved into the edge (&quot;droim&quot; or &quot;faobhar&quot;) of the stone, which formed the stemline against which individual characters are cut. The text of these &quot;Orthodox Ogham&quot; inscriptions is read beginning from the bottom left-hand side of a stone, continuing upward along the edge, across the top and down the right-hand side (in the case of long inscriptions). Roughly 380 inscriptions are known in total (a number, incidentally, very close to the number of known inscriptions in the contemporary Elder Futhark), of which the highest concentration by far is found in the southwestern Irish province of Munster. Over one-third of the total are found in County Kerry alone, most densely in the former kingdom of the Corcu Duibne.

Later inscriptions are known as &quot;scholastic&quot;, and are post 6th century in date. The term &#x27;scholastic&#x27; derives from the fact that the inscriptions are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript sources, instead of being continuations of the original monument tradition. Unlike orthodox ogham, some medieval inscriptions feature all five Forfeda. Scholastic inscriptions are written on stemlines cut into the face of the stone, instead of along its edge. Ogham was also occasionally used for notes in manuscripts down to the 16th century. A modern ogham inscription is found on a gravestone dating to 1802 in Ahenny, County Tipperary.

In Scotland, a number of inscriptions using the ogham writing system are known, but their language is still the subject of debate.
It has been argued by Richard Cox in &quot;The Language of Ogham Inscriptions in Scotland&quot; (1999) that the language of these is Old Norse, but others remain unconvinced by this analysis, and regard the stones as being Pictish in origin. However, due to the lack of knowledge about the Picts, the inscriptions remain undeciphered, their language possibly being non-Indo-European. The Pictish inscriptions are scholastic, and are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript tradition brought into Scotland by Gaelic settlers.

A rare example of a Christianised (cross-inscribed) Ogham stone can be seen in St. Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church Gowran, County Kilkenny.

==Non-monumental uses==
As well as its use for monumental inscriptions, the evidence from early Irish sagas and legends indicate that ogham was used for short messages on wood or metal, either to relay messages or to denote ownership of the object inscribed. Some of these messages seem to have been cryptic in nature and some were also for magical purposes. In addition, there is evidence from sources such as &quot;In Lebor Ogaim&quot;, or the &quot;Ogham Tract&quot;, that ogham may have been used to keep records or lists, such as genealogies and numerical tallies of property and business transactions. There is also evidence that ogham may have been used as a system of finger or hand signals.

In later centuries when ogham ceased to be used as a practical alphabet, it retained its place in the learning of Gaelic scholars and poets as the basis of grammar and the rules of poetry. Indeed, until modern times the Latin alphabet in Gaelic continued to be taught using letter names borrowed from the &quot;Beith-Luis-Nin&quot;, along with the Medieval association of each letter with a different tree.

==Unicode==

Ogham was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

The spelling of the names given is a standardisation dating to 1997, used in Unicode Standard and in Irish Standard 434:1999.

The Unicode block for ogham is U+1680–U+169F.

==Neopaganism==
Modern New Age and Neopagan approaches to ogham largely derive from the now-discredited theories of Robert Graves in his book &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. In this work, Graves took his inspiration from the theories of the ogham scholar R. A. S. Macalister (see above) and elaborated on them much further. Graves proposed that the ogham alphabet encoded a set of beliefs originating in the Middle East in Stone Age times, concerning the ceremonies surrounding the worship of the Moon goddess in her various forms. Graves&#x27; argument is extremely complex, but in essence, he argues that the Hebrews, Greeks and Celts were all influenced by a people originating in the Aegean, called &#x27;the people of the sea&#x27; by the Egyptians, who spread out around Europe in the 2nd millennium BC, taking their religious beliefs with them. He posits that at some early stage these teachings were encoded in alphabet form by poets to pass on their worship of the goddess (as the muse and inspiration of all poets) in a secret fashion, understandable only to initiates. Eventually, via the druids of Gaul, this knowledge was passed on to the poets of early Ireland and Wales. Graves, therefore, looked at the Tree Alphabet tradition surrounding ogham and explored the tree folklore of each of the letter names, proposing that the order of the letters formed an ancient &quot;seasonal calendar of tree magic&quot;. Although his theories have been discredited and discarded by modern scholars (including Macalister himself, with whom Graves corresponded), they were taken up with enthusiasm by some adherents of the neopagan movement. In addition, Graves followed the BLNFS order of ogham letters put forward by Macalister (see above), with the result taken up by many New Age and Neopagan writers as the &#x27;correct&#x27; order of the letters, despite its rejection by scholars.

The main use of ogham by adherents of Neo-druidism and other forms of Neopaganism is for the purpose of divination. Divination with ogham symbols is possibly mentioned in &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot;, a tale in the Irish Mythological Cycle, wherein the druid Dalan takes four wands of yew, and writes ogham letters upon them. Then he uses the tools for what some interpret as a form of divination. However, as the tale doesn&#x27;t explain how the sticks are handled or interpreted, this theory is open to interpretation. A divination method invented by neopagans involves casting sticks upon a cloth marked out with a pattern, such as Finn&#x27;s Window, and interpreting the patterns. The meanings assigned in these modern methods are usually based on the tree ogham, with each letter associated with a tree or plant, and meanings derived from these associations. While some use folklore for the meanings, Robert Graves&#x27; book &quot;The White Goddess&quot; continues to be a major influence on these methods and beliefs.

<doc id="797152" wikidata="Q3235182" url="?curid=797152" title="AdventureQuest">
<text>AdventureQuest (also referred to by its website name BattleOn or abbreviated to AQ) is an online Flash-based single-player role-playing video game started in 2002 and currently developed by Artix Entertainment. 

A one-time &quot;guardianship&quot; fee was introduced in 2003, allowing the player to access extended in-game content. Ownership of the game transferred to the newly formed Artix Entertainment in 2004, and a server population cap was added for non-Guardian players in May of that year. In 2005, a microtransaction system was put into place. In response to criticism that server restrictions made logging on for non-paying players difficult, in October 2006 Artix Entertainment introduced a server in which a player could log on at any time, but with a tight level limit. In July 2010, the server cap was removed permanently.

==Gameplay==
&quot;AdventureQuest&quot; is a single-player RPG, although character data is stored on AE servers. The gameplay is similar to that of traditional RPGs in that it revolves around fighting monsters in a turn-based system. As players defeat monsters, they gain experience points, gold, and occasionally &quot;Z-Tokens&quot;, a secondary currency that can also be bought with real-world money. There are also special items or sets called Mastercrafts (MC for short), which are 5% stronger than normal items but cost 10% more gold/tokens.

Skill points, like mana, are used for certain class abilities. They are also used for some armor skills, as an upkeep cost for most misc items, and the usage of potions. Skill points are required to flee from battle; the higher the monster&#x27;s level, the more SP is needed.

&quot;AdventureQuest&quot; has an alignment system similar to that of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which includes selection between Good and Evil as well as Unity and Chaos. Actions taken in game affect the player&#x27;s alignment, and give the player a selection of custom rewards and access to in-game events. The game also includes equipment that will bestow special effects depending on the player&#x27;s alignment.

===Combat mechanics===
Most fights begin through random encounters and quests, which can be found throughout the game. The battle system is turn-based; on player&#x27;s turn, they may attack, equip an item (such as a weapon, shield, or armor), use other miscellaneous items, cast a spell, perform a skill (if players are equipped with an item that has a skill), call a pet/guest, or flee from the battle (if the player has enough skill points). Both characters and monsters have elemental and weapon-based resistances and weaknesses. Elements include fire, ice, water, energy, earth, wind, light, and darkness. There are three categories of attacks, and each weapon, spell, or skill belongs to a category: melee, ranged, or magic. There are six trainable stats (Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, Endurance, Charisma, and Luck). Strength/STR affects the amount of damage inflicted and taken if a melee/ranged attack is being used, as well as accuracy for melee attacks, Dexterity/DEX affects the amount of damage done or taken if a ranged attack is being used (but affects ranged damage less than STR does and it also increases dodge ability as well as accuracy). Intellect affects magic damage (and increases mana points) while also increasing the accuracy of magic weapons/skills and spells, endurance increases hit points, charisma affects damage being done by pets and guests, as well as their accuracy, and luck gives players small bonuses to accuracy and dodge chance for all attacks (it also increases the player&#x27;s chance of attacking first in battle, and lets them perform a Lucky Strike 10% of the time if they have LUK, which boosts their damage). A battle ends once the enemy&#x27;s HP drops to zero or if the player&#x27;s HP drops to zero.

Like most other RPGs, &quot;AdventureQuest&quot; has special releases or events as well as a limited time shop based on real-life holidays. Holidays include: Snugglefest (Valentine&#x27;s Day), the Blarney War (St. Patrick&#x27;s Day), April Fools, Mogloween (Halloween), and Frostval (Christmas). &quot;AdventureQuest&quot; also includes anniversary events such as The Dragon of Time, Curse of the Phantom Pixel, and Rise of the Shadow Council.

===Clans===

In &quot;AdventureQuest&quot;, players can participate in competitive activities through the clan system. There are eight clans available for players to join, representing the eight elemental realms. Clan bases contain a shop that sells items of its respective element, as well as clan-unique items.

In addition to the in-game leaders of these clans, there are player leaders who are elected on the BattleOn Forums. These players ensure activity and stability for their respective clans and also play larger parts during clan-based game releases.

=== Houses ===
Houses may be purchased with Z-Tokens. Furthermore, players may also use these Z-tokens to buy pictures and guards to decorate and protect their houses. When a player visits another player&#x27;s house, they must battle the owner&#x27;s guards - if any - in order to gain access to that house. Some buildings yield resources, such as health and mana potions, in varying amounts, depending on the quality of the house in question.

==Payment==
===Guardianship===
Guardianship, which can be purchased for a one-time fee of $19.95, gives players access to premium content. This fee goes toward the maintenance of the game and its servers. Guardians can reach a maximum level of 150 while adventurers can reach a maximum level of 135. It also boosts the player&#x27;s Z-Token count by 1000. Players can also go to more locations in the game that adventurers can&#x27;t, such as the Guardian Tower. Furthermore, guardians can unlock quests and items that are not for adventurers. Other exclusives include the ability to create an account for &quot;ArchKnight&quot; and &quot;ZardWars&quot;, which are similar side-games that are also developed by Artix Entertainment. Furthermore, players can upgrade to another form of membership known as the X-Guardian, which gives even more in-game advantages, such as faster XP gain.

=== Z-Tokens ===

Introduced in June 2006, Money or Z-Tokens are rare coins in &quot;AdventureQuest&quot; that are occasionally found after winning a battle. Players may also purchase Z-Tokens with real-world money. Players may use Z-Tokens to buy shields, armor, weapons, pets, and items. These Z-Token-bought combat items tend to be more powerful than normal items of the same level, and can be purchased at a relatively lower player level. Players may also purchase inventory slots with Z-Tokens, or trade them for in-game gold. A special shop called the Limited Time Shop offers mostly Z-Token equipment, usually either discounted or soon-to-be rare.

==Critical reception==
A common criticism of &quot;AdventureQuest&quot; is that there is little to no player interaction with other players in the game. &quot;OMGN&quot; praised the graphics, theme and the broad range of quests, events, stories, equipment and monsters. The battle system was considered easy to learn, but not as exciting.

<text>The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery () is the artillery personnel branch of the Canadian Army.

==History==
Many of the units and batteries of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery are older than the Dominion of Canada itself. The first artillery company in Canada was formed in the province of Canada (New France) in 1750.

Volunteer Canadian artillery batteries existed before 1855 but their history is mostly unknown. Seven batteries of artillery were formed after the passage of the Militia Act of 1855 which allowed Canada to retain a paid military force of 5,000 men. One of the pre-1855 volunteer batteries formed in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1793 was called the &quot;Loyal Company of Artillery&quot; and exists today as the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA.

===After Confederation===
On 20 October 1871, the first regular Canadian army units were created, in the form of two batteries of garrison artillery; thus, that date is considered the regiment&#x27;s birthday. &quot;A&quot; Battery in Kingston, Ontario, and &quot;B&quot; Battery in Quebec City, Quebec, became gunnery schools and performed garrison duties in their respective towns. They are still active today as part of the 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA).

The Royal Canadian Artillery was granted its &#x27;Royal&#x27; prefix by Queen Victoria on May 24, 1893.

The Royal Canadian Artillery has participated in every major conflict in Canada&#x27;s history.

===Riel Rebellions===
In 1870, in response to the Red River Rebellion led by Louis Riel, Colonel Garnet Wolseley led a force of British regulars and Canadian Militia across Northern Ontario to quell the uprising. The force never partook in any combat. Following the establishment of Manitoba in May 1870, the militia portion of the force was garrisoned along the Red River. After 1872 this included the newly formed Manitoba Demi-Battery, which was composed of Regular gunners of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Battery.

In 1885, when Riel led the North-West Rebellion in the District of Saskatchewan, A and B Batteries, as well as several militia batteries, including the Winnipeg Field Battery, were dispatched to quell the uprising. Upon arriving in Saskatchewan, &quot;A&quot; Battery and Winnipeg Field fought at Fish Creek and Batoche. &quot;B&quot; Battery moved west to Swift Current where they participated in the Battle of Cut Knife, which saw the first use by Canadian soldiers of the machine gun, and the last time in Canadian history that bows and arrows were used in battle.

In 1886, the Regular Gunners of A &amp; B Batteries returned east, transferring their guns to the North-West Mounted Police.

===Boer War===


During the war in South Africa, Canada contributed the Brigade Division of the Canadian Field Artillery. It consisted of three batteries, named &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, each of six 12-pounder field guns. Each battery consisted of three sections of two guns each, and was manned by a core of Permanent Force soldiers, with additional members from the Militia. The militia for &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; batteries came from Ontario and Winnipeg, while &quot;E&quot; battery had militia from Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.

&quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; Batteries arrived in Cape Town aboard the SS &quot;Laurentian&quot; in February 1900, and were soon sent north to form part of a column based at Victoria West under Colonel Sir Charles Parsons. In March and April they took part in an operation in the Kenhardt district, covering in six weeks, seeing little action, but much heavy rain. On 29 May, &quot;E&quot; battery was part of another operation under Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Warren, when it was attacked at Faber&#x27;s Put. The Boers were eventually driven off, though the battery had one man killed and eight wounded. In his subsequent despatch Warren particularly mentioned &quot;E&quot; Battery&#x27;s Major Ogilvie and Captain Mackie. By the end of June &quot;E&quot; Battery had been split up into sections and was stationed along the Kimberley–Mafeking Railway.

In July 1900 &quot;D&quot; Battery moved to Pretoria to operate in the Transvaal in a column commanded by Colonel Ian Hamilton, and saw much action, with a section particularly distinguishing itself at the battle of Leliefontein, when 100 men of the Royal Canadian Dragoons and 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, bolstered by a single Colt machine gun and the two 12-pounders of the battery, repelled an attack by 200 mounted Boers while covering the withdrawal of the main column. Three Victoria Crosses were won during the engagement.
&quot;C&quot; Battery arrived at Cape Town aboard the SS &quot;Columbian&quot; in March 1900, but within two weeks were re-embarked to sail to Beira, from where they travelled by train, cart, and forced march to join Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Plumer&#x27;s column south of Otse by mid-April to take part in the relief of Mafeking. Colonel Baden-Powell, the garrison commander at Mafeking, sent a telegram to the Canadian Government stating : &quot;Mafeking relieved today, and most grateful for invaluable assistance of Canadian Artillery, which made record march from Beira to help us&quot;. From the end of May the battery operated with Plumer&#x27;s column in the Zeerust district until November, seeing action regularly.

The unit never operated as a whole, with the batteries, and sometimes even sections, operating independently, often for months at a time, and it was only reunited when it regrouped to return to Canada in June 1901.

===World War I===

The Canadian Artillery and the Garrison Artillery were the designations of the Non-Permanent Active Militia as of 1 January 1914. The Canadian Artillery and the Garrison Artillery were collectively re-designated the Royal Canadian Artillery on 3 June 1935.
===World War II===
The R.C.H.A. and R.C.A. expanded tremendously during the war to contribute the following units to the European theater:
Other regiments included the 9th Anti-Tank Regiment (Self-Propelled) (Argyll Light Infantry), RCA.


=== Coastal defences Pacific coast ===
The RCA was also responsible for the defence of Canada on both the west and east coasts. In 1936 a review was done by Major Treatt of the Royal Artillery of the existing defences and potential sites for new forts. Efforts to improve the existing fortifications and build new ones were well underway by 1939.

There were approximately 10 armed forts and gun positions established along the Pacific west coast. The ones in the Strait of Juan de Fuca were integrated with the U.S. coastal defences. As the war progressed and the threat of attack diminished, the forts were gradually drawn down and demobilized. The last active coastal defence fort on the west coast, Fort Rodd Hill, was deactivated in 1958.

===Korean War===

===Cold War===
The Regular and Reserve components of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, Royal Canadian Artillery and Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery were collectively re-designated the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery on 29 October 1956.

===Afghanistan===
&quot;F&quot; Battery, 2nd Regiment, RCHA, fired the first Canadian artillery rounds in Afghanistan in February 2004 as part of Operation Athena&#x27;s first rotation. The mission was shot with a 105 mm LG1 and consisted of illumination rounds shot in a range spread to identify a potential rocket launching site used by insurgents.

In December 2005, 1st Regiment, RCHA, conducted an inaugural firing of its first 155 mm M777 towed howitzers. The first six guns delivered were supplied by the United States Marine Corps under a foreign military sales (FMS) contract between the U.S. and Canada. The Canadian guns were first fired by &quot;A&quot; Battery, 1 RCHA, at CFB Shilo and then were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Archer, and were put into service in the Canadian theatre of operations around Kandahar in early 2006. This marked the first use by any nation of the M777 in combat operations. Regular RCHA units, reinforced by volunteers from Reserve units, continued to support operations until Canada completed its combat mission in Afghanistan in March 2014.
===Since Afghanistan===
In June 2017, the Royal Canadian Artillery Band, one of only two Regular bands in the Canadian Army, provided musical support for a contingent of the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry which provided the Queen&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace, St James&#x27;s Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle.
In October–November 2018, the Band again deployed to England to provide musical support for a contingent from the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, which provided the Queen&#x27;s Guard.

==Units==
The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery is composed of both regular and reserve (militia) forces. The regular force component is composed of five units, four of which are front line operation units; of these, three are field artillery regiments while the fourth is a low level air defence unit. The fifth regular unit is the Royal Canadian Artillery School. Additionally, while the three field artillery regiments are on the RCA&#x27;s order of battle, they are badged as regiments of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery.

Despite not being the senior component of the Canadian Army, the honour of &quot;the right of the line&quot; (precedence over other units), on an army parade, is held by the units of the RCHA when on parade with their guns. On dismounted parades, RCHA units take precedence over all other land force units except formed bodies of Officer Cadets of the Royal Military College of Canada representing their college. RCA units parade to the left of units of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. The Royal Canadian Artillery does not carry colours. Its guns are its colours and are saluted on parade.

<text>The title of Earl of Inverness (Scottish Gaelic: Iarla Inbhir Nis) is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was first created in 1718 in the Jacobite Peerage of Scotland, together with the titles Viscount of Innerpaphrie and Lord Cromlix and Erne, by James Francis Edward Stuart (&quot;James III &amp; VIII&quot;) for the Honourable John Hay of Cromlix, third son of the 7th Earl of Kinnoull. He was created Duke of Inverness in 1727, but both titles became extinct upon the death of the grantee in 1740.

It has been created several times in of the Peerage of the United Kingdom, each time as a subsidiary title for a member of the royal family. It was created first in 1801 as a subsidiary title of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, sixth son of George III, becoming extinct in 1843. Sussex&#x27;s second wife, Cecilia Underwood (whom he married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 making the marriage legally void), was given the title of Duchess of Inverness in her own right, which became extinct upon her death in 1873.

The next creation was for Prince George (later George V), second son of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and grandson of Queen Victoria, as a subsidiary title along with the Dukedom of York. As the Prince became King in 1910, succeeding his father, his titles merged in the crown.

The title was created again in 1920 as a subsidiary title of the Prince Albert (second son of George V), who was also created Duke of York at the same time. The title merged in the crown when Albert succeeded his brother in 1936 to become King George VI.

The title was created a fourth time in 1986 as a subsidiary title for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, along with the title of Baron Killyleagh.

In 2019, some residents of Inverness started a campaign to strip him of that title, stating that &quot;it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew is associated with our beautiful city.&quot; due to the prince&#x27;s infamous friendship with disgraced financier and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. In 2022, there was a renewed petition to strip him of the title.

<text>Kerrighed is an open source single-system image (SSI) cluster software project. The project started in October 1998 at the Paris research group The French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control. From 2006 to 2011, the project was mainly developed by Kerlabs. In January, 2012 the Linux clustering mission of Kerlabs was adopted by a new company: We Cluster, Inc. headquartered in Pacific Grove, California. January 18, 2012: Kerrighed 3.0 has been ported to Ubuntu 12.04 with Linux Kernel v3.2.

==Background==
Kerrighed is implemented as an extension to the Linux operating system. It helps scientific applications such as numerical simulations to use more power. Such applications may be using OpenMP, Message Passing Interface, and/or a Posix multithreaded programming model.

Kerrighed implements a set of global resource management services that aim at making resource distribution transparent to the applications, at managing resource sharing in and between applications and at taking benefit of the whole cluster resources for demanding applications. Kerrighed provides a development framework allowing to easily implement dynamic scheduling policies without kernel modification.

Kerrighed provides several features such as a distributed shared memory with a sequential consistency model, processes migration from one cluster node to another, and to a limited extent checkpointing. 

Kerrighed uses a &quot;container&quot; concept: this entity is an abstraction of both files and memory. Each Kerrighed node starts a root container in which only local resources are available. To access resources globally, one
must start the Kerrighed container on one node then add other nodes to the Kerrighed container.

<text>Wade Dooley (born 2 October 1957) is a former England rugby union international who played lock forward. He played for his country 55 times and was known as the &quot;Blackpool Tower&quot;, as a result of being 6 feet 8 inches tall and a police officer with Lancashire Constabulary in Blackpool.

Dooley was born in Warrington, Northern England and played rugby league as a teenager, taking up rugby union aged 19. He played most of his career for Preston Grasshoppers, where he was nurtured by former England international and coach Dick Greenwood. He also had a brief spell with Fylde and with New Brighton F.C.

Dooley made his international debut on 5 January 1985 against Romania. He later established a second row partnership with fellow police officer Paul Ackford.

In 1987 he broke the cheekbone of Welsh player Phil Davies with a punch during a rough game in Cardiff.

Dooley went on the 1989 British Lions tour to Australia, playing in the final two test matches. He was also part of the England team that won back-to-back grand slams in 1991 and 1992.

Dooley also went on the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand, but left the tour to return home for the funeral of his father. He was replaced on the tour by the Leicester lock Martin Johnson, and decided to retire.

Since retirement, Dooley and his wife, Sharon, have run a tea room called &quot;Dizzy Ducks&quot; at Wrea Green.

<doc id="797175" wikidata="Q698706" url="?curid=797175" title="Battle of Kosovo (1448)">
<text>The Second Battle of Kosovo (Hungarian: &quot;második rigómezei csata&quot;, Turkish: &quot;İkinci Kosova Muharebesi&quot;) was a land battle between a Hungarian-led Crusader army and the Ottoman Empire at Kosovo field that took place from 17–20 October 1448. It was the culmination of a Hungarian offensive to avenge the defeat at the Battle of Varna four years earlier. In the three-day battle the Ottoman army under the command of Sultan Murad II defeated the Crusader army of regent John Hunyadi.

After the battle, the path was clear for the Turks to conquer Serbia and the other Balkan States, it also ended any hopes of saving Constantinople. The Hungarian kingdom no longer had the military and financial resources to mount an offensive against the Ottomans. With the end of the half-century-long Crusader threat to their European frontier, Murad&#x27;s son Mehmed II was free to lay siege to Constantinople in 1453.

==Background==
In 1444, the Hungarian king, Władysław III of Poland, in breach of a ten-year truce that existed with the Ottoman Empire following the Peace of Szeged, launched a new crusade. Meeting the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Varna, the crusading army was destroyed and the king was killed. Two years later in 1446, Sultan Murad II returned to the Balkans seeking revenge for the treaty breaking that preceded the battle. That year his army breached the Hexamilion wall and ravaged the Peloponnese after which, following the proclamation of a new crusade by Pope Nicholas V, Murad invaded Albania, conquering the fortress of Svetigrad. Meanwhile, four years after his defeat at Varna, John Hunyadi, the richest landowner in Hungary, had joined forces with Albania&#x27;s war leader Skanderbeg in an alliance that also included Serbia and Bosnia. Resolved to defeat the Ottoman army, Hunyadi raised an army of 24,000 men, including 8,000 Wallachians, his Hungarian cavalry supplemented by German and Bohemian infantry mercenaries. Hunyadi&#x27;s strategy was based on an expected revolt of the Balkan peoples, a surprise attack, and the destruction of the main force of the Ottomans in a single battle after linking up with his allies.

In September 1448, Hunyadi led his forces across the Danube and camped them in Serbia next to Kovin, just outside the Serbian capital of Smederevo. For a full month the Hungarians stayed encamped awaiting their German, Wallachian, Bohemian and Albanian allies. The news of the crusader threat forced Murad to abandon his campaign against Albania. Believing the strength of his army to be inadequate to face the crusaders, Murad retreated back to Sofia to stockpile resources necessary for the campaign and receive reinforcements. While gathering the necessary provisions in Sofia, news reached the army that a Wallachian force had crossed the Danube and attacked Ottoman positions in Nicopolis. A unit of Akinjis was dispatched to respond to the attack, which succeeded in ambushing and dispersing the Wallachians, taking many prisoners in the process. The POWs captured during the ambush were sent to Sofia, where the news of the victory had increased morale among the Ottoman troops before their march towards the crusader army. Meanwhile, the Albanian army under Skanderbeg was delayed as it was prevented from linking up with Hunyadi&#x27;s army by the Ottomans and their allies. It is believed that the Albanian army was delayed by Serbian despot Đurađ Branković, whose army occupied the mountain passes on the Serbian-Albanian border, and by a Venetian attack on northern Albania. The Serbs had declined joining Hunyadi&#x27;s forces due to an earlier truce with the Turks. Branković&#x27;s exact role is disputed. As a result, Skanderbeg ravaged and pillaged Branković&#x27;s domains as punishment for deserting the Christian cause, whereas Hunyadi decided not to wait for Skanderbeg and his reinforcements to open the battle.

==Battle==

The Crusaders, numbering 22,000–30,000 arrived at Kosovo Field (the site of the first Battle of Kosovo in 1389, between Serbs and Ottomans) facing an Ottoman army of 40,000–60,000 men. Sultan Murad personally commanded a large section of cannoneers and janissaries, while his son and would-be successor, 16-year-old Mehmed, who faced battle for the first time, led the Anatolian troops at the right wing. Hunyadi commanded the center of his army in the battle, while the crusader right wing was made up of Wallachians. The Hungarians had a long barrage cannons. Calculating that he would need more than 40,000 men to defeat the Ottomans, the Hungarian regent sought to join up with anti-Ottoman Albanian forces, possibly led by Skanderbeg. The Ottomans in their base at Sofia received word of the Crusader army&#x27;s march route and subsequently began readying their men.

Having failed to locate the main Ottoman army, whom he believed to still be at their capital in Edirne, Hunyadi was caught by surprise on the 17th of October when the Ottoman army appeared in front of his men at Kosovo Field. He constructed a &quot;tabor&quot; wagon fort at Plementina hill from which to fight the Ottomans, who built their own stockade in response. The battle opened when Hunyadi attacked the Ottoman flanks with mixed cavalry (light and heavy). The Turkish flanks, consisting of soldiers from Rumelia and Anatolia, were losing until the Turkish light cavalry arrived to reinforce them. Cavalry skirmishing on the flanks of the stockades during the first two days and a Crusader night-time attack using their wagons and guns against the Sultan&#x27;s central position on the night of 18/19 October produced much bloodshed but no conclusive results. The Christian flanks were subsequently routed and the survivors retreated back to Hunyadi&#x27;s main force. On 19 October Murad II used his &quot;sipahi&quot; cavalry from Thessaly to envelop the cavalry on the Crusader left flank, along with a general assault all along the line to distract Hunyadi from the primary effort. The manoeuvre worked and the Wallachian, Moldavian, and Hungarian cavalry were cut down by the &quot;sipahis&quot;, who took no prisoners. 

When Hunyadi saw the defeat of his flanks, he attacked with his main force, composed of knights and light infantry. The janissary corps were not successful at stopping the attack; the cavalry made progress through the Turkish centre, but were eventually stopped at the Turkish camp. When the main attack was halted, the Turkish infantry regrouped and successfully drove the Hungarian knights back. The light cavalry, who now lacked the knights&#x27; support, were also overcome. Much of the crusader army then retreated to their camp. On the 20th of October, the Wallachians deserted to the Ottoman side after being offered terms from Murad, leaving Hunyadi mostly defenceless.

With Murad II personally observing the struggle, the Janissaries attacked and killed everyone left in the stockade. Hunyadi fled, but was later captured by the Serbs. During the night, Turkish infantry fired missiles at the Hungarians, who replied with cannon fire. On the next day, a final assault destroyed the remaining troops of the Hungarian army.

==Aftermath==
The Christian Balkan states were unable to resist the Ottomans after this defeat, eventually falling one after the other under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Hunyadi was captured by Branković in retaliation for the damage perpetrated by the Hungarian army in Serbia. Hunyadi&#x27;s release was negotiated against a ransom of 100,000 florins, the return of the domains that Hunyadi had revocated from Branković, and the engagement of Hunyadi&#x27;s heir to Branković&#x27;s daughter, other sources cite the restitution of the despot&#x27;s estates in Hungary while leaving Hunyadi&#x27;s elder son László at Smederevo as a hostage. For the remainder of his reign Hunyadi successfully defended the Kingdom of Hungary against Ottoman campaigns. As punishment for lending its support to Hunyadi, Murad attacked and submitted Wallachia in 1449, followed by Albania in 1450 where Skanderbeg continued to resist, breaking Murad&#x27;s siege of the Castle of Krujë in 1451. That year Murad died replaced by his 19-year-old son Mehmed II who, after securing Constantinople in 1453, launched a new military campaign against Serbia in 1454.

<doc id="797176" wikidata="Q7714424" url="?curid=797176" title="The Art of Computer Game Design">
<text>The Art of Computer Game Design by Chris Crawford is the first book devoted to the theory of computer and video games. The book attempts to categorize computer games and talks about design precepts that serve as guidelines for game designers. It was originally published in Berkeley, California, by McGraw-Hill/Osborne Media in 1984. The original edition became available as a free download from a site maintained by Washington State University, Pullman in 1997. In 2011 the free download was removed and the text is currently available as a Kindle e-book.

==Background==
Crawford in 1981 and 1982 coauthored a series of technical articles in &quot;BYTE&quot; on developing games for the Atari 8-bit computers. The articles were collected into &quot;De Re Atari&quot;. In December 1982 he published an article in &quot;BYTE&quot; on abstract aspects of game design, using &quot;Legionnaire&quot; as example.

==Reception==
Calling the author &quot;a master of computer game design&quot;, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; complimented Crawford using his own games as examples of success and failure, and recommended the book to both game designers and players. Orson Scott Card was less favorable, writing in &quot;Ahoy!&quot; that &quot;when one of the best computer game designers in the business writes a book about computer game design, you expect it to be wonderful ... And when [&quot;The Art of Computer Game Design&quot;] turned out to be merely fascinating but often shallow and sometimes just plain wrong-headed, I was disappointed&quot;.

<text>The First Main Directorate () of the Committee for State Security under the USSR council of ministers (PGU KGB) was the organization responsible for foreign operations and intelligence activities by providing for the training and management of covert agents, intelligence collection administration, and the acquisition of foreign and domestic political, scientific and technical intelligence for the Soviet Union. 

The First Chief Directorate was formed within the KGB directorate in 1954, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union became the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR RF). 

The primary foreign intelligence service in Russia and the Soviet Union has been the GRU, a military intelligence organization and special operations force.

==History of foreign intelligence in the Soviet Union==

From the beginning, foreign intelligence played an important role in Soviet foreign policy. In the Soviet Union, foreign intelligence was formally formed in 1920 as a foreign department of Cheka (&quot;Inostrannyj Otdiel&quot;—INO), during the Russian Civil War of 1918–1920. On December 19, 1918, the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) Central Committee Bureau decided to combine Cheka front formations and the Military Control Units, which were controlled by the Military Revolutionary Committee, and responsible for counter-intelligence activities, into one organ that was named Cheka &quot;Special Section&quot; (department). The head of the Special Section was Mikhail Sergeyevich Kedrov. The Special Section&#x27;s task was to run human intelligence: to gather political and military intelligence behind enemy lines, and expose and neutralize counter-revolutionary elements in the Red Army. At the beginning of 1920, the Cheka Special Section had a War Information Bureau (WIB), which conducted political, military, scientific and technical intelligence in surrounding countries. WIB headquarters was located in Kharkiv and was divided in two sections: &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Southern&quot;. Each section had six groups: registration, personal, technical, finance, law, and organization.

WIB had its own internal stations, in Kiev and Odessa. The first had the so-called national section—Polish, Jewish and German.

On December 20, 1920, Felix Dzerzhinsky created the Foreign Department (&quot;Innostranny Otdel&quot;—INO), made up of the Management office (INO chief and two deputies), chancellery, agents department, visas bureau and foreign sections. In 1922, after the creation of the State Political Directorate (GPU) and connecting it with People&#x27;s Commisariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the Russian SFSR, foreign intelligence was conducted by the GPU Foreign Department, and between December 1923 and July 1934 by the Foreign Department of Joint State Political Directorate or OGPU. In July 1934, OGPU was reincorporated into NKVD of the Soviet Union, and renamed the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB). Until October 9, 1936, INO was operated inside the GUGB organization as one of its departments. Then, for conspiracy purposes, People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs Nikolai Yezhov, in his order #00362 had introduced a numeration of departments in the GUGB organization, hence Foreign Department or INO of the GUGB became GUGB&#x27;s Department 7, and later Department 5. By 1941, foreign intelligence was given the highest status and it was enlarged to directorate. The name was changed from INO (Innostranny Otdiel) to INU—&quot;Inostrannoye Upravleniye&quot;, Foreign Directorate. During the following years, Soviet security and intelligence organs went through frequent organizational changes. From February to July 1941, foreign intelligence was the responsibility of the recently created new administration the People&#x27;s Commissariat of State Security (NKGB) and was working in its structure as a 1st Directorate and, after the July 1941 organizational changes, as a 1st Directorate of the People&#x27;s Commisariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD).

It then returned to its former state. Already in April 1943, NKGB dealt with foreign intelligence as a 1st Directorate of NKGB. That state remained until 1946, when all People&#x27;s Commissariats were renamed Ministries; NKVD was renamed Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the NKGB was renamed into Ministry of State Security (MGB). From 1946 to 1947, the 1st Directorate of the MGB was conducting foreign intelligence. In 1947, the GRU (military intelligence) and MGB&#x27;s 1st Directorate was moved to the recently created foreign intelligence agency called the Committee of Information (KI). In the summer of 1948, the military personnel in KI were returned to the Soviet military to reconstitute a foreign military intelligence arm of the GRU. KI sections dealing with the new East Bloc and Soviet émigrés were returned to the MGB in late 1948. In 1951, the KI returned to the MGB, as a First Chief Directorate of the Ministry of State Security.

After the death of longtime Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in March 1953, Lavrenty Beria took over control of the security and intelligence organs, disbanded the MGB and its existing tasks were given to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) which he was in control of. In the MVD, the foreign intelligence was conducted by the Second Chief Directorate and following the creation of KGB foreign intelligence was conducted by the First Chief Directorate of the Committee for State Security or KGB, subordinate to the council of ministers of the USSR.

==Chiefs of foreign intelligence==

The first chief of the Soviet foreign intelligence service, Cheka foreign department (&quot;Inostranny Otdel&quot;—INO), was Yakov Davydov. He headed the foreign department until late 1921, when he was replaced by longtime revolutionary Solomon Mogilevsky. He led INO only for few months, as in 1925 he died in a plane crash.

He was replaced by Mikhail Trilisser, also a revolutionary. Trilisser specialized in tracing secret enemy informers and political spies inside the Bolshevik party. Before becoming INO chief, he led its Section of Western and Eastern Europe. Under Trilisser&#x27;s management, foreign intelligence had become big professionally and respected by their opponent&#x27;s services. This period characterized the enlisting of foreign agents, wide use of emigrants for intelligence tasks and organization of a network of independent agents. Trilisser himself was very active, personally traveling to Berlin and Paris for meetings with important agents.

Trilisser left his position in 1930, and was replaced by Artur Artuzov, the former chief of department of counter-intelligence (KRO) and main initiator of the Trust Operation. In 1936, Artuzov was replaced by then State Security Commissar 2nd rank Abram Slutsky. Slutsky was an active participant of the October Revolution and Russian Civil War. He had started work in security organs in 1920 by joining Cheka and later working in OGPU, Economic Department. Then in 1931, he went to serve in OGPU&#x27;s Foreign Department (INO), and often left the country for Germany, France and Spain, where he participated in the Spanish Civil War. In February 1938, Slutsky was invited to the office of GUGB head komkor Mikhail Frinovsky, where he was poisoned and died.

Slutsky was replaced by Zelman Passov, but soon he was arrested and murdered, his successor Sergey Spigelglas had met with the same fate, and by the end of 1938, he was arrested and murdered. The next chief (acting) of Foreign Department for only three weeks was the experienced NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov. Before he became INO head in May, 1938, on Stalin&#x27;s direct order, he personally assassinated the Ukrainian nationalist leader Yavhen Konovalets.

Later in June 1941, Sudoplatov was placed in charge of the NKVD&#x27;s Special Missions Directorate, whose principal task was to carry out sabotage operations behind enemy lines in wartime (both it and the Foreign Department had also been used to carry out assassinations abroad). During World War II, his unit helped organize guerrilla bands, and other secret behind-the-lines units for sabotage and assassinations, to fight the Nazis. In February, 1944, Lavrenty Beria (head of NKVD) named Pavel Sudoplatov to also head the newly formed Department S, which united both GRU and NKVD intelligence work on the atomic bomb; he was also given a management role in the Soviet atomic effort, to help with coordination.

After Sudoplatov left his post, he was replaced by Vladimir Dekanozov, before becoming INO head, Dekanozov was Deputy Chairman of the Georgian Council of People&#x27;s Commissars and after he left his post in 1939 and became the Soviet ambassador in Berlin.

For the next seven years, from 1939 to 1946, the chief of the foreign intelligence department (then 5th Department of the GUGB/NKVD) was a very young NKVD officer and graduate of the first official intelligence school (SHON), Major of State Security Pavel Fitin. Fitin graduated from a program in engineering studies at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in 1932 after which he served in the Red Army, then became an editor for the State Publishing House of Agricultural Literature. The All-Union Communist Party (CPSU) selected him for a special course in foreign intelligence.

Fitin became deputy chief of the NKVD&#x27;s foreign intelligence in 1938, then a year later at the age of thirty-one became chief. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service credits Fitin with rebuilding the depleted foreign intelligence department after Stalin&#x27;s Great Terror. Fitin also is credited with providing ample warning of the German Invasion of 22 June 1941 that began the Great Patriotic War. Only the actual invasion saved Fitin from execution for providing the head of the NKVD, Lavrenty Beria, with information General Secretary of the CPSU, Joseph Stalin did not want to believe. Beria retained Fitin as chief of foreign intelligence until the war ended but demoted him.

From June to September 1946, the head of foreign intelligence (MGB 1st directorate), was Lieutenant General Pyotr Kubatkin (born in 1907), when he was replaced by then Lieutenant General Pyotr Fedotov (born in 1900). Before he became head of foreign intelligence, he was working in OGPU/GUGB counter-intelligence and &#x27;Secret Political departments and then he headed the NKVD&#x27;s counter-intelligence department. From 1949 to 1951, the head of intelligence in the Committee of Information was Sergey Savchenko. Savchenko was born in 1904 and at first he was working as a security guard. He joined Soviet security organs in 1922 and in the 1940s was a top NKVD man in Ukrainian SSR. When Andrey Vyshinsky became &quot;Minister for Foreign Affairs&quot; and the head of Committee of Information, Savchenko was his deputy and head of foreign intelligence. In 1951, he was replaced by Lt. Gen. Yevgeny Petrovich Pitovranov, longtime secret service worker. Between 1950 and 1951, he was the deputy of MGB head Viktor Abakumov.

On March 5, 1953, MVD and MGB were merged into the MVD by Lavrenty Beria and his people took over all high positions. The foreign intelligence (2nd Chief Directorate of the MVD), was given to Vasili Ryasnoy. After Lavrenty Beria was arrested, along with his people in MVD, Aleksandr Panyushkin became the head of foreign intelligence.

==Early operations==

In the first years of existence, Soviet Russia did not have many foreign missions that could provide official camouflage for legal outpost of intelligence called residentura, so, foreign department (INO) relied mainly on illegals, officers assigned to foreign countries under false identities. Later when official Soviet embassies, diplomatic offices and foreign missions had been created in major cities around the world, they were used to build legal intelligence post called residentura. It was led by a resident whose real identity was known only to the ambassador.

The first operations of the Soviet intelligence concentrated mainly on Russian military and political emigration organizations. According to Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s directions, the foreign intelligence department had chosen as his main target the &quot;White Guard people&quot; (White movement), of which the largest groups were in Berlin, Paris and Warsaw. The intelligence and counter-intelligence department led long so called intelligence games against Russian emigration. As a result of those games, the main representatives of Russian emigration like Boris Savinkov were arrested and sent for many years to prison. Another well known action against a Russian emigration conducted in the 1920s was Operation Trust (Trust Operation). &quot;Trust&quot; was an operation to set up a fake anti-Bolshevik underground organization, &quot;Monarchist Union of Central Russia&quot;, MUCR (Монархическое объединение Центральной России, МОЦР). The &quot;head&quot; of the MUCR was Alexander Yakushev (Александр Александрович Якушев), a former bureaucrat of the Ministry of Communications of Imperial Russia, who after the Russian Revolution joined the Narkomat of External Trade (Наркомат внешней торговли), when the Soviets had to allow the former specialists (called &quot;specs&quot;, &quot;спецы&quot;) to take positions of their expertise. This position allowed him to travel abroad and contact Russian emigrants. MUCR kept the monarchist general Alexander Kutepov (Александр Кутепов), head of a major emigrant force, Russian All-Military Union (Русский общевоинский союз), from active actions and who was convinced to wait for the development of the internal anti-Bolshevik forces.

Among the successes of &quot;Trust&quot; was the luring of Boris Savinkov and Sidney Reilly into the Soviet Union to be arrested. In Soviet intelligence history, the 1930s proceeded as a so-called Era of the Great Illegals. Among others Arnold Deutsch, Theodore Maly and Yuri Modin were officers leading the Cambridge Five case.

One of the biggest successes of Soviet foreign intelligence was the penetration of the American Manhattan Project, which was the code name for the effort during World War II to develop the first nuclear weapons of the United States with assistance from the United Kingdom and Canada. Information gathered in the United States, Great Britain and Canada, especially in USA, by NKVD and NKGB agents then supplied to Soviet physicists, allowed them to carry out the first Soviet nuclear explosion in 1949.

In March 1954, Soviet state security underwent its last major postwar reorganization. The MGB was once again removed from the MVD, but downgraded from a ministry to the Committee for State Security (KGB), and formally attached to the Council of Ministers in an attempt to keep it under political control. The body responsible for foreign operations and intelligence collection activities was First Chief Directorate (FCD).

The first head of FCD was Aleksandr Panyushkin, the former ambassador to the United States and China and former head of Second Chief Directorate in MVD responsible for foreign intelligence. Panyushkin&#x27;s diplomatic background, however, did not imply any softening in MVD/KGB operational methods abroad. Indeed, one of the first foreign operations personally supervised by Panyushkin was Operation Rhine, the attempted assassination of a Ukrainian émigré leader in West Germany.

In 1956, Panyushkin was succeeded by his former deputy Aleksandr Sakharovsky, who was to remain head of FCD for record period of 15 years. He was remembered in the FCD chiefly as an efficient, energetic administrator. In 1971, Sakharovsky was succeeded by his 53-year-old former deputy Fyodor Mortin, a career KGB officer who had risen steadily through the ranks as a loyal protégé of Sakharovsky. Mortin was on top the FCD only for two years, when, in 1974, he was succeeded by the 50-year-old Vladimir Kryuchkov, who was almost to equal Sakharovsky&#x27;s record term as head of the FCD. After 14 years in FCD Hq, he was to become chairman of the KGB in 1988. Kryuchkov joined the Soviet diplomatic service, stationed in Hungary until 1959. He then worked for the Communist Party headquarters in Ukraine for eight years before joining the KGB in 1967. In 1988 he was promoted to General of the Army rank and became KGB Chairman. In 1989–1990, he was a member of Politburo. The next and last head of FCD was born on March 24, 1935, in Moscow Leonid Shebarshin.

* Sixteenth Department: signals intelligence and code-breaking
* Seventeenth Department: India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma
* Eighteenth Department: Arab Near Eastern Countries and Egypt
* Nineteenth Department: Soviet Union Emigres
* Twentieth Department: liaison with Third World states

==Active measures and assassinations==
&quot;Active measures&quot; () were a form of political warfare conducted by the Soviet security services to influence the course of world events, &quot;in addition to collecting intelligence and producing politically correct assessment of it&quot;. Active measures ranged &quot;from media manipulations to &quot;special actions&quot; involving various degree of violence&quot;. They included disinformation, propaganda, and forgery of official documents. The preparation of forged &quot;CIA&quot; documents which were then shown to third-world leaders was often successful in sowing suspicion.

Active measures included the establishment and support of international front organizations (e.g., the World Peace Council); foreign communist, socialist and opposition parties; wars of national liberation in the Third World; and underground, revolutionary, insurgency, criminal, and terrorist groups. The intelligence agencies of Eastern Bloc and other communist states also contributed to the program, providing operatives and intelligence for assassinations and other types of covert operations.

The Thirteenth Department was responsible for direct action, including assassination and sabotage; at one time it was led by Viktor Vladimirov. They were used both abroad and domestically. Occasionally, KGB assassinated the enemies of the USSR abroad—principally Soviet Bloc defectors, either directly or by aiding Communist country secret services. For instance: the killings of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists members Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera by Bohdan Stashynsky in Munich in 1957 and 1959, as well as the unrelated slayings of emigre dissidents like Abdurahman Fatalibeyli, and the surreptitious ricin poisoning of the Bulgarian émigré Georgi Markov, shot with an umbrella-gun of KGB design, in 1978. The defection of assassins like Nikolai Khokhlov and Bohdan Stashynsky severely curtailed such activities however, and the KGB largely stopped assassinations abroad after Stashynsky&#x27;s defection, although they continued assisting the Eastern European sister services in doing so.

==FCD residency organization==
The KGB First Chief Directorate residency was the equivalent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station. The chief of residency (Resident) was the equivalent of the CIA&#x27;s Chief of Station.

A &quot;legal resident&quot; is a spy who operates in a foreign country under diplomatic cover (e.g., from his country&#x27;s embassy). He is an official member of the consular staff, such as a commercial, cultural, or military attaché. Thus, he has diplomatic immunity from prosecution and cannot be arrested by the host country if suspected of espionage. The most the host country can do is send him back to his home country. He is in charge of the residency and the personnel. He is also an official contact who well-known people in government can contact in times of crisis.

In 1962, KGB Washington, D.C. Resident Aleksandr Fomin (real name Alexander Feklisov) played a huge role in resolving the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The residency was divided into lines (sections). Each line was responsible for its assigned task of gathering intelligence. For instance, one of the lines was responsible for counterintelligence.

The Line KR (short for &quot;kontrazviedka,&quot; counterintelligence) played a big role in the KGB residency, being responsible for counterintelligence and security of the residency and the consulate or embassy that housed the residency. Mainly it used so-called &quot;defensive counterintelligence&quot; tactics. This meant that Line KR attention and force was used for the internal security. Line KR had operational control over residency personnel, surveillance, establishment of any suspicious contacts of residency personnel with citizens of the country where they are staying that they had not reported, checking personal mail, etc. Line KR used such tactics to prevent or uncover anyone from the residency or embassy from being recruited by the enemy, such as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

In 1985, the Line KR&#x27;s role was increased considerably after CIA counterintelligence officer Aldrich Ames and FBI counterintelligence special agent Robert Hanssen volunteered their services to the KGB residency in Washington, DC.

In return for money, they gave the KGB the names of officers of the KGB residency in Washington, DC, and other places, who cooperated with the FBI and/or the CIA. Line KR officers immediately arrested a number of people, including Major General Dmitri Polyakov, a high-ranking military intelligence officer (GRU). He was cooperating with the CIA and FBI. Ames reported that Colonel Oleg Gordievsky, London resident, had spied for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6). Line KR officers arrested many others, whom they sent to Moscow. There they were passed into the hands of the KGB Second Chief Directorate (counterintelligence).

After a quick and secret process, they were sentenced to death. The death sentences were carried out in the Lubyanka Prison. They were buried face down in unmarked graves. Only Oleg Gordievsky was able to escape from the USSR, with SIS help. 

Line KR officers did not want to immediately arrest all the KGB personnel identified by Ames and Hanssen because they did not want to draw the attention of the CIA and FBI (which it did). They wanted to run a game of disinformation. But Washington Resident Stanislav Androsov wished to demonstrate his office&#x27;s effectiveness to his superiors and ordered the immediate arrest of all who helped the CIA and FBI. After those incidents, the security of residencies was increased and the Line KR was assigned more security officers, especially in countries like the United States and Great Britain.
The KGB&#x27;s FCD residency was divided in two parts – Operational Staff and Support Staff

* KGB Resident
::Operational staff
* Line PR – collects information about political, economic, and military strategic intelligence, also active measures
* Line KR – counterintelligence and security
* Line X – scientific and technical intelligence, specifically, acquisition of Western technology
* Line N – support to illegals
* Line EM – intelligence on emigres
* Line SK – security and surveillance of the Soviet diplomatic community
* Special Reservists
::Support staff
* Driver
* Line OT - operational technical support, including Impulse intercepting station monitoring communications of the local counterintelligence service
* Line RP - signals intelligence
* Line I - computers
* Cipher clerk radio operator
* Secretary/typist
* Accountant

<doc id="797181" wikidata="Q16010710" url="?curid=797181" title="Antium">
<text>Antium was an ancient coastal town in Latium, south of Rome. An oppidum was founded by people of Latial culture (11th century BC or the beginning of the 1st millennium BC), then it was the main stronghold of the Volsci people until it was conquered by the Romans. 

In some versions of Rome&#x27;s foundation myth, Antium was founded by Anteias, son of Odysseus.

The territory of Roman Antium almost entirely corresponded to modern Anzio and Nettuno.

== Location ==
The Latin-volscian town stood in the Capo d&#x27;Anzio (modern Anzio), on a higher ground and somewhat away from the shore, though it extended down to it. This was defended by a deep ditch, which can still be traced, and by walls, a portion of which, on the eastern side, constructed of rectangular blocks of tufa, was brought to light in 1897. The fortification of the town would  included the acropolis, to which it would be adjacent to the east, isolated but connected. The Latin colony of 467 BC, of which it will be said later, would be installed alongside the fortified Latin-volscian oppidum, also to the east.

A coeval port town, Caenon, was the port under the control of Antium (which did not have a natural harbour of its own): according to alternative theories, the port of Caenon would be located in the Capo d&#x27;Anzio, or the port town very north of it, or the town on a hill near Nettuno to the east, and the port over the mouth of the nearby river Loricina. 

The settlement of Roman Antium was certainly present in the area of the Capo d&#x27;Anzio (in particular, a presumed extensive town since the mid-republican age, the imperial colony and the great harbour of Nero), but a parallel agricultural settlement, with the same name, was likely to be in the same position as modern Nettuno since the colony of 338 BC; so from 60 AD the &quot;colonia Antium&quot; of Nero in the Capo d&#x27;Anzio would coexisted with a supposed, more ancient, &quot;civitas Antium&quot; in Nettuno, which in the 4th century AD would have been the only real town: a thesis that has found some perplexities or an opposition.

== History ==
=== Volscian Antium ===
As said in the beginning, for a long time Antium was the capital of the Antiates Volsci, on the Thyrrenian coast.

In 493 BC - the same year that, according to a theory, the Volsci likely settled in the town - the Roman consul Postumus Cominius Auruncus fought and defeated two armies from Antium and as a result captured the Volscian towns of Longula, Pollusca and Corioli (to the north of Antium).

According to Plutarch the Roman leader Coriolanus, who fought at Corioli, took refuge at Antium to the noble Attius Tullius Aufidius, when the Roman had been accused of disloyalty to Rome and the Volsci. Aufidius obtained consent that, by Volscian hand, Coriolanus was first tried, then assassinated before the end of the trial.

In 469 BC the town Caenon was destroyed by the Roman consul Titus Numicius Priscus.

In 468 BC Antium was captured by the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus following a war started by the Volsci, and the mentioned Latin colony was planted there the next year. Three Roman ex-consuls were appointed as commissioners to allocate the lands (triumviri coloniae deducendae) amongst Roman colonists. They were Titus Quinctius, the consul of the previous year who had captured Antium from the Volsci; Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus, the consul of 469 BC; and Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus, the consul of 472 BC.

In 464 BC the Antiates were suspected of allying with the Aequi against Rome. The chief men of Antium were summoned to Rome but they did not give adequate explanations. Antium was asked to contribute emergency troops for the Roman war against the Aequi, however the force of 1,000 troops from Antium arrived too late to help.

In 338 BC the consul Gaius Menius Publius suddenly attacked and defeated the troops of Aricia, Lanuvium and Velitres as they were joining the Antiates next to the river Astura. Antium was finally defeated and its warships seized, a part taken to the arsenals in Rome, while the others burned. The town was banned from navigation, and Gaius Menius had the rostra of the burned ships mounted in the Roman Forum as ornaments of the speaker&#x27;s platform thenceforth called the &quot;Rostra&quot;.

=== Roman Antium ===


In 338 BC Antium became a &quot;colonia&quot; with Roman citizenship of the Antiates, and in 317 BC it became a &quot;municipium&quot;. The Roman colony had &quot;duumvirs&quot;, and &quot;quaestors&quot; were also present as magistrates. 

During the civil war against Gaius Marius, Antium - breadbasket of Rome - was allied with Sulla: in 87 BC it suffered a surprise attack and was devastated by the Marian troops, with many citizen deaths. 

With the expansion of Roman Republic Antium was just far enough away to be insulated from the riots and tumults of Rome. The Romans built magnificent seaside villas there and their remains are conspicuous all along the shore, both to the east and to the northwest of the town. Gaius Maecenas also had a villa. Many ancient masterpieces of sculpture have been found there: the &quot;Fanciulla d&#x27;Anzio&quot;, the &quot;Borghese Gladiator&quot; (in the Louvre) and the &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot; (in the Vatican) were all discovered in the ruins of villas at Antium. When Cicero returned from exile, it was at Antium that he reassembled the battered remains of his libraries, where the scrolls would be secure.

Of the villas, the most famous was the imperial villa, known as Domus Neroniana (Villa of Nero), which was used by each emperor in turn, up to the Severans and which extended some along the seafront of the Capo d&#x27;Anzio. Augustus received a delegation from Rome there to acclaim him &quot;Pater patriae&quot; (&quot;Father of his Country&quot;). The Julian and Claudian emperors frequently visited it; both Emperor Caligula and Nero were born in Antium. Nero razed the villa on the site to rebuild it on a more massive scale and according to an imperial style. Including a theatre were built in Antium. In 60 AD Nero also founded a colony of veterans and built a new harbour, the projecting moles of which still exist. 

Of the famous temple of Fortune (Horace, &quot;Od&quot;. i. 35) no remains are known, but its location is assumed in the Capo d&#x27;Anzio, area of the Domus Neroniana.

=== Late Antiquity ===
There are records of the participation of a few bishops of Antium in synods held in Rome: Gaudentius in 465, Felix in 487, Vindemius in 499 and 501. Barbarian incursions in the 6th century put an end to its existence as a residential bishopric. Accordingly, Antium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

=== Middle Ages ===

Attacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric (5th century), the Goths of Vitiges (6th century), and then by the Saracens, in the Middle Ages Antium was deserted in favour of Nettuno, which maintained the legacy of the ancient town.

Nettuno is usually attributed only a medieval origin, but in the modern era it was considered a natural heir, a continuation of Antium; a view taken up by a contemporary orientation.

<text>The 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion was a Ranger battalion activated during World War II on 1 September 1943 at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. By this time, while in maneuvers on the United States, they were commanded by the Major Owen Carter. Later, when they moved to England, they were commanded by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Max Schneider, former executive officer of the 4th Ranger Battalion, who led the 5th Rangers as part of the Provisional Ranger Group commanded by Colonel James Earl Rudder.

==History==

===World War II===
The 5th Ranger Battalion was activated on 1 September 1943 at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. During the Battle of Normandy, the battalion landed on Omaha Beach along with companies A, B and C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, where elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division were pinned down by murderous machine gun fire and mortars from the heights above. It was there that the situation was so critical that General Omar Bradley was seriously considering abandoning the beachhead, instead of sending more men to die. And it was then and there that General Norman Cota, Assistant Division Commander of the 29th Infantry Division, gave the now famous order that has become the motto of the 75th Ranger Regiment: &quot;Rangers, Lead The Way!&quot;

The 5th Battalion Rangers broke across the seawall and barbed wire entanglements, and up the pillbox-rimmed heights under intense enemy machine gun and mortar fire and with A, B and C Companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion and elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment, advanced four miles (6 km) to the key town of Vierville-sur-Mer, thus opening the breach for supporting troops to follow up and expand the beachhead. Meanwhile, D, E and F Company of the 2nd Ranger Battalion landed west of the Vierville draw and suffered 50 percent casualties during the landing, scaling a cliff using ropes and ladders to knock out a formidable enemy artillery position that was sweeping the beach with deadly fire.

The 5th Battalion with elements of the 116th Regiment finally linked up with the beleaguered D,E and F companies of 2nd Battalion on D+3, although Lieutenant Charles Parker of A Company, 5th Battalion, had penetrated deep behind enemy lines on D-Day and reached the 2nd Battalion with 20 prisoners. Later, with the 2nd Battalion, the unit distinguished itself in the hard-fought Battle for Brest. Under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Richard Sullivan, the 5th Ranger Battalion took part in the Battle of Huertgen Forest, Battle of the Bulge and other tough battles throughout central Europe, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations and the French Croix de Guerre.

===Deactivation===
The outfit was deactivated 22 October 1945 at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts.

In 1986, the still deactivated 5th Ranger Battalion was consolidated with units of the 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger) during its reorganization into the 75th Ranger Regiment. 

==Battle honors==
Battle honors received for actions in the invasion of France:

* Citation approved by the Commanding General, First U.S. Army, in the name of the President of the United States for actions as leading assault unit on the beach at H-Hour on D-Day in the invasion of France.
* Commendation from Major General C. H. Gerhardt for participation in the capture of the City of Brest, Fort Pt. Minon and Fort De Mengaht.
* Commendation from Lieutenant General William H. Simpson in the capture of Brest.

<doc id="797187" wikidata="Q3845774" url="?curid=797187" title="Marquess of Carisbrooke">
<text>Marquess of Carisbrooke was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1917 for Alexander Mountbatten (formerly Prince Alexander of Battenberg), eldest son of Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (youngest daughter of Queen Victoria) and Prince Henry of Battenberg. He was made Viscount Launceston, in the County of Cornwall, and Earl of Berkhampstead at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Along with other German-surnamed relations of the British royal family, Alexander also changed his surname at that time, to Mountbatten. The titles became extinct upon Lord Carisbrooke&#x27;s death in 1960, as he had no sons.

Carisbrooke Castle was the residence of Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice as Governor of the Isle of Wight. The title of Marquess of Berkhampstead had previously been conferred with the Dukedom of Cumberland on Prince William Augustus, son of King George II, in 1726. The title of Viscount Launceston had previously been conferred with the Dukedom of Edinburgh on Prince Frederick Louis, later Prince of Wales, also in 1726.

The first State Convention of the Personal Choice Party of Utah was held May 22, 2004, at Fairmont Park in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Personal Choice Party dates back to approximately 1997, and was organized by Dr. Ken Larsen, an ex-Mormon from Utah with a Ph.D. in Zoology from Brigham Young University.

Prior to forming the Personal Choice Party, Larsen was known as a political activist and frequent candidate for numerous political offices in Utah under the ballot lines of several minor parties including the Libertarian Party and the Independent American Party.

The party dissolved after the 2006 elections, and Larsen returned to the Libertarian Party, which nominated him for Governor of Utah in 2012.

== Philosophy ==
The Personal Choice Party asserted that everyone has free agency and individual rights. PCP expresses the philosophy of &quot;live and let live.&quot; and demands that, &quot;as long as I am not hurting anyone else, only I have the right to choose how I spend my time, my wealth, my life, my honor.&quot; It could be considered a libertarian party.

The preamble of the party&#x27;s constitution – which specifies that it is the personal opinion of the party&#x27;s founders – states:
== Issues ==
PCP supports drastic reductions in government. Many other positions have been attributed to PCP; however, PCP emphasizes that these positions are those of individual PCP members and not those of the party as a whole.

== Principal figures ==
* Charles Jay, 2004 Presidential nominee, and former candidate for 2004 Libertarian Party Vice President
* Marilyn Chambers Taylor, 2004 United States Vice-Presidential nominee
* Ken Larsen, Moderator (as opposed to Chairman), Utah Gubernatorial candidate

== Other election campaigns ==
The Personal Choice Party also ran candidates in the Utah 2004 senate elections and two of Utah’s three 2004 house elections. In these races, Republican incumbents were all reelected. PCP candidates Joe Labonte (United States Senate), Richard Soderberg (Utah United States House First District) and Curtis James (Utah United States House Third District) each received 1% of the vote.

The Personal Choice Party also ran candidates in some Utah elections in 2006. Its most notable candidate, Roger Ira Price, who ran for the United States Senate in 2006, received 1.6% of the vote. The party also ran candidates in some state legislature races. The most any candidate received was 4% of the vote. Some controversy was caused when it was alleged that some voters were confused by the party&#x27;s positive name, including its smiley-face logo, which appeared on voting machines which, in Utah, give the option for voters to vote for all candidates in one political party at the same time. The party received 14% of the single-party votes in Salt Lake County, which some believe was caused by this confusion. However, many of these voters apparently voted for other candidates before officially submitting their vote. Party founder Larsen said that there was no confusion, mentioning that in 2004 and 2005 12% of Utah taxpayers agreed to donate $2 to the Personal Choice Party on their tax forms, though the party did not accept the funds.

<text>Theoren Wallace &quot;Theo&quot; Fleury (born June 29, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, author and motivational speaker. Fleury played for the Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, New York Rangers, and Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), Tappara of Finland&#x27;s SM-liiga, and the Belfast Giants of the UK&#x27;s Elite Ice Hockey League. He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, and played over 1,000 games in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.

One of the smallest players of his generation, Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations. As a junior, he was at the centre of the infamous Punch-up in Piestany, a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the Soviet Union from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over 1,000 points in his career, placing him 61st in career NHL scoring and won the Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames. During his career Fleury recorded 90+ points four times, and 100+ points twice. He twice represented Canada at the Winter Olympics, winning a gold medal in 2002. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in 2003. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005–06, and made two attempts to win the Allan Cup. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.

Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a pilot for a reality television show about it. He marketed his own brand of clothing, which led him to play two professional baseball games for the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League. In 1995, he was diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease, and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1 million for the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of Canada.

Fleury co-wrote &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, a best-selling autobiography released in October 2009, in which he revealed that he had been sexually abused by former coach Graham James. Fleury filed a criminal complaint against James, who subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault. Fleury has since become an advocate for sexual abuse victims and developed a career as a public speaker. He was a recipient of the Indspire Award in the sports category in 2013. Additionally, Theoren hosts the &quot;Theo Fleury 14 Hockey Camp&quot; which helps to teach, inspire and educate young hockey players ages 6 to 16. Moreover, Fleury travelled to Vancouver in 2013 where he assisted and co-hosted the 19th Annual Aboriginal Achievement Awards.

==Early life==
Fleury was born on June 29, 1968, in Oxbow, Saskatchewan, the first of Wally and Donna Fleury&#x27;s three sons. Wally was a hockey player whose dreams of a professional career ended when he broke his leg playing baseball in the summer of 1963; the injury helped fuel a drinking problem. Donna was a quiet, religious woman who battled drug addiction for many years. Fleury is of Métis heritage and his grandmother Mary was Cree. Fleury was subject to racism for being of Metis descent throughout his playing career. The Fleurys lived in Williams Lake, British Columbia, for four years, a period that saw Theo&#x27;s brother Ted born in 1970, before settling in Russell, Manitoba, by 1973, the year his youngest brother Travis was born. Wally worked as a truck driver and maintenance worker at the arena in Russell. Fleury and his family shared a passion for music. One of his fondest memories when he was a child was listening to his grandfather play the fiddle. Fleury&#x27;s father was a talented man who could play a variety of instruments, such as the piano and guitar. This passion for music brought happiness and joy to Theoren and his family as it was a part of their Metis heritage growing up.

Always one of the smallest children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.

Although his mother was a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, Fleury was raised as a Catholic. He attended Mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church&#x27;s priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his early positive influences.

Always lacking money and stable home life, Fleury received support from the hockey community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required. In January 1982, Fleury&#x27;s dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his brachial artery. He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result. Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the Andy Murray Hockey School in Brandon, Manitoba. It was there that Fleury met Graham James, who was working as a scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL). James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Fleury began his junior career in 1983–84 as a 15-year-old with the St. James Canadians of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, scoring 33 goals and 64 points in 22 games, an incredible pace of nearly three points per game. In 1984–85 he moved to the Moose Jaw Warriors, who had just relocated from Winnipeg, scoring 29 goals and 75 points in 71 games as a 16-year-old. He improved his totals in each of his four years in the WHL, culminating with a 68-goal, 92-assist season in 1987–88. Fleury&#x27;s 160 points tied him for the league lead with Joe Sakic, and the two players shared the Bob Clarke Trophy as the WHL&#x27;s top scorers. Fleury&#x27;s 92 assists and 160 points remain team records; he also holds the Warriors&#x27; career records for goals (201), assists (271) and points (472). , he remains 10th all-time in WHL scoring.

Always one of the smallest players in the game, Fleury learned early that he had to play an unpredictable style of game to survive against players much larger than he was. He found that the best way to protect himself was to intimidate his opponents by playing a feisty, physical game, which he said led to many retaliatory penalties and several arguments with his coaches. He recorded 235 minutes in penalties in his final year of junior, nearly 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers. Fleury retained this style of play throughout his hockey career, routinely surprising opponents who felt their size was an advantage.
Fleury twice represented Canada at the World Junior Hockey Championships. He first joined the team for the 1987 tournament in Piešťany, Czechoslovakia. The tournament is best remembered for the &quot;Punch-up in Piestany&quot; on January 4, 1987, an infamous bench-clearing brawl between the Canadians and the Soviet Union. Fleury scored the first goal of the game and, as part of his celebration, used his stick to mimic firing a machine gun at the Soviet bench, a move that was criticized by Canadian officials. The brawl began early in the second period with Canada leading 4–2, when Pavel Kostichkin slashed Fleury, leading to a fight between the two. It quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice, after which the Soviet players left their bench, followed closely by the Canadians. Both teams were disqualified from the tournament, costing Fleury and the Canadians a medal – potentially the gold.

The International Ice Hockey Federation suspended all players involved in the brawl from participating in international tournaments for 18 months, though the bans were later reduced to 6 months on appeal. This reduction allowed Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament in Moscow. He was named captain, finished second in team scoring with eight points in seven games, and was named a tournament all-star as Canada won the gold medal.

Although he scored 129 points for the Warriors in 1986–87, Fleury&#x27;s small stature led many teams to doubt that he could play in the NHL. The Calgary Flames drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Upon completing his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth C$415,000, and joined the Flames&#x27; International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the Turner Cup championship.

===Calgary Flames===
Fleury arrived at the Flames&#x27; 1988 training camp overweight, and was assigned back to Salt Lake to begin the 1988–89 season. He averaged nearly two points per game, recording 37 goals and 37 assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40 games. Mired in a slump, the Flames recalled Fleury on January 1, 1989, in the hope he could help their offence. He played his first NHL game against the Quebec Nordiques two nights later and recorded his first points – three assists – on January 5 against the Los Angeles Kings. He scored his first two NHL goals in a 7–2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on January 7. Fleury continued to score, and finished with 34 points in 36 games in his NHL rookie season. He added 11 points in the playoffs, helping the Flames to the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history.

After improving to 33 goals in his first full season, Fleury broke out in 1990–91, scoring 51 goals and 104 points to lead the Flames offensively. He played in the 1991 All-Star Game, scoring a goal in an 11–5 victory by the Campbell Conference over the Wales Conference. Towards the end of the season, Fleury set a league record by scoring three shorthanded goals in one game against the St. Louis Blues. He shared the NHL Plus-Minus Award with Marty McSorley, whom he tied for the league lead with +48. Fleury scored only two goals in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs, but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously slid the entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him. CBC &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; play-by-play announcer Chris Cuthbert called Fleury&#x27;s goal in a dramatic fashion: Unfortunately, the Flames were defeated in game seven by an overtime goal from Esa Tikkanen, which ended their season.

Fleury fell back to 33 goals in 1991–92 as the Flames missed the playoffs. That season, he made his second All-Star Game appearance, recording a goal for the Campbell Conference. Fleury finished with over 100 points for the second time in his career in 1992–93 to lead the team in scoring, and set a franchise record by going +9 in a 13–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on February 10, 1993, in which he scored six points.

The 1994–95 NHL lockout reduced the season to 48 games from 84. During the lockout, Fleury played for Tappara in Finland&#x27;s top league, the SM-liiga. He recorded 17 points in ten games before the NHL&#x27;s labour dispute was resolved, bringing him back to Calgary. Late in the season, Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to surpass 500 career points.

Lacking a contract prior to the 1995–96 season, Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12 million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take less money than he could have received on the open market out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity. He missed much of the preseason with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener. Although he felt like somebody was &quot;stabbing a knife in [his] gut every five minutes&quot;, Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it. Despite the ailment, Fleury led the team in goals, assists, and points, and played in his third All-Star Game, serving as Calgary&#x27;s only representative.

When Joe Nieuwendyk refused to report to the Flames prior to the 1995–96 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made permanent when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé.

The Flames struggled in 1996–97, finishing last in the Pacific Division and missing the playoffs for only the second time since their arrival in Calgary in 1980. Fleury again led the team in scoring, but his 29 goals were the fewest he had scored in a full season in the NHL. He was the Flames&#x27; lone representative at the 1997 All-Star Game. He scored only 27 goals in 1997–98, but increased his point total from 67 to 78 while also leading the team with 197 penalties in minutes. On November 29, 1997, Fleury scored his 315th career goal, breaking Nieuwendyk&#x27;s franchise record. The same day, he was named to Team Canada for the 1998 Winter Olympics. Fleury participated in his fifth All-Star Game that season, but the Flames again missed the playoffs.
On February 19, 1999, he surpassed Al MacInnis as the franchise scoring leader with his 823rd career point. He held the record for 10 years until surpassed by Jarome Iginla in 2009. The Flames, who had been struggling financially and were unable to sign Fleury to a new contract, chose to trade him less than two weeks after he broke the record rather than risk losing him to free agency. He was dealt to the Colorado Avalanche on February 28 for René Corbet, Wade Belak, and Robyn Regehr. Although it was expected, the trade nonetheless stunned fans in Calgary. His popularity was such that during a game in 1999, after Fleury was sent off the ice to change a bloody jersey, a fan threw his own souvenir jersey over the boards so that Fleury would not miss a shift. He put the jersey on before realizing it was autographed and handed it back.

The trade was viewed as another sign that small-market Canadian teams could no longer compete in the NHL. The economics of hockey had changed such that the Flames felt that they had to deal their top player despite being just two points out of a playoff spot. However, with Fleury due to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, the Flames did not want to chance losing him without getting anything in return. Following the trade, Fleury said that any team looking to sign him to a new contract would have to pay him $7 million per year. In his autobiography, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, Fleury claims that he was offered $16 million over four years by the Flames before the trade, and countered with an offer of $25 million over five years.

===Colorado, New York, and Chicago===
Fleury made his debut for the Avalanche the day after the trade and was met with loud cheers from the Denver crowd. He scored a goal in a 4–3 loss to Edmonton, but also sprained his knee and missed the next two weeks. He had missed only seven games during his 11-year career in Calgary. He played in 15 regular-season games for the Avalanche, scoring 10 goals and 14 assists, and another 5 goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games before the Avalanche were eliminated by the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Finals.

The Avalanche chose not to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year contract worth $21 million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7 million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames&#x27; owners and not the team&#x27;s fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury&#x27;s first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15 goals in 1999–2000, struggling under the pressure of trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.

Fleury rebounded to score 30 goals in 2000–01 and participated in his seventh All-Star Game. He scored his 400th NHL goal on November 4, 2000, in a 5–2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Fleury was leading his team, and was fourth in the league, with 74 points in 62 games, when the Rangers announced that he had again entered the league&#x27;s substance abuse program. The decision ended his season.

Prior to the 2001–02 season Fleury said that he continued to struggle with substance abuse and had difficulty adapting to life in Manhattan after growing up in a Canadian prairie town of 1,500. He played all 82 games in 2001–02, but his problems affected his behavior on the ice. After receiving a major and game misconduct penalty in a game against the San Jose Sharks on December 28, he wound up in a confrontation with the Sharks&#x27; mascot, S.J. Sharkie, in a hallway of the HP Pavilion, reportedly breaking the rib of the mascot portrayer. Fleury himself later downplayed the incident, saying that he &quot;nudged&quot; Sharkie. Upon taking a penalty in a January 2002 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Fleury left the arena rather than skate to the penalty box. He later apologized to his teammates, claiming he was deeply stressed by family problems. Two weeks later, he was fined $1,000 for making an obscene gesture to fans of the New York Islanders who had been taunting him over his drug use. Towards the end of February, he lashed out against the league&#x27;s officials. He claimed they were not judging him fairly, and threatened to retire. The league dismissed his complaints. He did achieve a personal milestone during the season, however: on October 27, 2001, Fleury assisted on a goal by Mike York, scoring the 1,000th point of his NHL career. The Rangers presented him with a silver stick in honour of the achievement.

Following the season, the Rangers did not exercise their option, and traded Fleury&#x27;s playing rights to the San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5 million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior to the opening of the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league&#x27;s substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury&#x27;s friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL&#x27;s aftercare program.

Fleury missed the first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with teammates in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12 goals and 21 assists in 54 games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.

===Senior hockey and the Belfast Giants===
In January 2005, Fleury announced that he had joined his cousin Todd Holt and former NHL players Gino Odjick, Sasha Lakovic and Dody Wood in playing for the Horse Lake Thunder of the North Peace Hockey League for the Allan Cup, Canada&#x27;s national senior amateur championship. He also hoped to serve as a role model for kids on the Horse Lake First Nation. Hockey Alberta initially ruled that he was ineligible to play senior hockey in 2004–05 because he had been signed to a professional contract during the 2003–04 season. Hockey Alberta denied an appeal, citing a new policy it had put in effect to prevent NHL players from joining senior teams during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. It reversed its decision on a second appeal after the NHL and National Hockey League Players Association both agreed that Fleury was a free agent, and not a locked-out player. Fleury played his first game for the Thunder on January 22, 2005, scoring a goal and two assists.

Fleury remained embroiled in controversy at the 2005 Allan Cup tournament. The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours that he was secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after they were eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: &quot;The one thing that&#x27;s really bothered me through this whole thing is the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I&#x27;ve seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it&#x27;s absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on.&quot;

Fleury was convinced by a friend to move to the United Kingdom to play with the Belfast Giants of the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) for the 2005–06 season. He scored three goals and added four assists and a fight in his first game, against the Edinburgh Capitals. He scored 22 goals and 52 assists in 34 games, as Belfast won the regular season league title. Described as the &quot;most talented&quot; player ever to play in the United Kingdom, Fleury was named the EIHL&#x27;s Player of the Year and voted a first team All-Star by the British Ice Hockey Writers Association. Fleury argued with visiting fans, as well as officials, which led him not to return to Belfast in 2006–07.

In late 2008, Fleury joined his brother Ted with the Steinbach North Stars in a second bid to win the Allan Cup. He played 13 league games, scoring eight goals and 19 assists. At the 2009 Allan Cup tournament, he recorded a goal and an assist to lead the host North Stars to a 5–0 win in their opening game, and finished tied for the lead in tournament scoring at seven points. The North Stars lost the semi-finals to the South East Prairie Thunder, 4–2.

===NHL comeback attempt===
Unhappy with how his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a personal trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt to return to the NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to lift his suspension. He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and league doctors. Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames. He said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury&#x27;s comeback was financially motivated.

He made his return to the NHL in an exhibition game in Calgary against the New York Islanders on September 17 on a line with Daymond Langkow and Nigel Dawes. Fleury was met with loud cheers throughout the game, and scored the only goal in a shootout to give the Flames a 5–4 win. After the game, he saluted the crowd as the fans chanted &quot;Theo! Theo! Theo!&quot; Three nights later, he scored a goal and an assist in a 5–2 victory over the Florida Panthers.

Fleury played four exhibition games, scoring four points, before being released by the Flames. General Manager Darryl Sutter expressed his pride in Fleury&#x27;s attempt and commended his effort, but decided he was not one of the top six wingers in camp, which Sutter and Fleury had agreed was a condition of the tryout continuing. On September 28, 2009, Fleury announced his retirement at a news conference at the Saddledome. He thanked the Flames for allowing him to attempt the comeback, and expressed satisfaction at how his career ended. &quot;I get to retire a Calgary Flame. I HAD to retire a Calgary Flame. It&#x27;s been a long journey. It&#x27;s time to put down some roots. And there&#x27;s no better place than here,&quot; said Fleury of his decision not to seek an offer from another team.

Fleury made his debut with the Canadian senior team at the 1990 Ice Hockey World Championships, scoring 11 points in nine games for the fourth-place Canadians. He returned the following year despite a knee injury, helping Canada win the silver medal at the 1991 tournament. His 51-goal NHL season in 1990–91 also earned Fleury a spot at the 1991 Canada Cup, where he scored a goal and four assists in seven games for the tournament champion Canadians. Five years later, he played in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, the successor to the Canada Cup. He finished fourth in the tournament with four goals, but Canada finished in second place after giving up four goals in the final four minutes of the championship game against the American team.

National Hockey League players were first allowed to participate in the Olympic ice hockey tournament at the 1998 games. Invited to join Canada&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;, Fleury described his selection as a highlight of his life. He scored a goal for Canada, who lost their semi-final match-up against the Czech Republic in a shootout and failed to medal. Four years later, Fleury was invited by General Manager Wayne Gretzky to participate in Canada&#x27;s selection camp for the 2002 Olympics. The invitation was controversial, as his behavioural and substance abuse issues had become increasingly public in previous months. Fleury wanted to justify Gretzky&#x27;s support and, knowing that he would be removed from consideration if he failed, refrained from drinking or taking drugs during the 2001–02 NHL season, later describing himself as a &quot;dry drunk&quot;. He earned a spot on the team and recorded two assists in six games as the Canadian hockey team won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years. Fleury considers the championship to be the pinnacle of his career.

==Charitable work and advocacy for abuse, addictions programs==
===Sexual abuse charges against Graham James===
With the help of Kirstie McLellan Day, Fleury wrote his autobiography, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, which was released on October 16, 2009. He wrote he was sexually abused by hockey coach Graham James during a two-year period. While he stated he &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to become the poster boy for abuse by James&quot;, Fleury hoped speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward, and get help. The book became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, he and his wife were unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury&#x27;s life, following &quot;Fury&quot;, released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time. &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; became the top seller on Amazon.ca within a week of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been contacted by several sexual abuse victims who were motivated by his book to seek help.

He told CBC in October 2009 he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James, and was volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims. Sheldon Kennedy, another victim of James, encouraged Fleury to press charges. In January 2010, investigators with the Winnipeg Police Service began an investigation after Fleury met with officers to file a complaint. James plead guilty to charges stemming from his abuse of Fleury and his cousin Todd Holt. James was sentenced to two years in prison, a decision which sparked outrage across Canada for its perceived leniency. Fleury praised the response by Canadians and called for harsher punishments for sexual predators. Fleury has shared his story as a motivational speaker.

McLellan Day adapted the autobiography into a one-man play, entitled &quot;Playing with Fire: The Theo Fleury Story&quot;, which was produced by Alberta Theatre Projects in Calgary in 2012. Fleury and his autobiography were also the subject of a 2012 documentary by HBO Canada.

=== Work with programs for abuse victims, addictions and other services ===
Fleury has been open about his struggles against drug and alcohol addictions, and his own experiences with sexual abuse. He is also an advocate for youth victims of sexual abuse and a supporter of improving access to trauma treatments, addictions programs and mental health services.

In his autobiography, he blamed the sexual abuse for turning him into a &quot;raging, alcoholic lunatic&quot;, and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004. He revealed most of his income had been spent on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women.

Fleury said he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but the NHL did not want to suspend him because he was a top scorer. The league disputed this claim, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.

Fleury has organized or participated in numerous charitable causes. He launched a hockey school in the mid-1990s that ran for seven years in Calgary and another eight in Russell, Manitoba and donated the proceeds to minor hockey associations.

Following his diagnosis with Crohn&#x27;s disease in 1995, Fleury joined with the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of Canada to host an annual golf tournament in Calgary. The event has raised over $1 million, and is one of the organization&#x27;s largest fundraising events in the Calgary area. He participates in Flames Alumni events and volunteers with the Calgary Dream Centre, which helps people overcome addictions.

Fleury was a participant on the second season of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation figure skating reality show &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;, aired in the fall of 2010, and was donating his winnings to The Men&#x27;s Project, a charity that provides support for men abused in childhood. His partner was Jamie Salé and the pair finished 5th.

Fleury said in a November 2004 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he was still battling the drug and alcohol addictions that had ended his NHL career a year and a half earlier. On September 18, 2005, he became sober and credited the achievement to help from his second wife, Jennifer. Fleury feared Jennifer&#x27;s frustrations with his addictions would cost him the relationship. With her help, he was able to quit alcohol and drug abuse.

Fleury and Jennifer met when he was playing for Horse Lake in 2005. They married one year later and have a daughter, Skylah. Fleury also has a son and daughter, Beaux and Tatym, with his first wife, Veronica, and a son, Josh, born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend, Shannon.

== Political opinions and conspiracy theories ==
Fleury and Jamie Salé host &quot;The Theo &amp; Jamie Show: Fire and Ice&quot;, an online program with the Calgary-based conservative media outlet Canadians for Truth. Politically, Fleury is a conservative although he has previously voted for the Liberal Party in past federal elections.

Fleury is a skeptic of COVID-19 vaccines. When reports about the virus were first made in late 2019, Fleury said he believed the virus was &quot;complete bullshit.&quot; He has criticized liberal and conservative politicians who supported mask and vaccine mandates, including Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He has also promoted ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 and criticised the mainstream media for a supposed &quot;absolute all out disinformation campaign&quot; over its use.

He told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Canada is an &quot;authoritarian&quot; country and that Trudeau is controlled by &quot;five entities.&quot; In a separate interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham in January 2022, he repeated his belief that Trudeau was being controlled by unnamed foreign entities and hoped the Canada convoy protest would lead to a &quot;revolution.&quot;

In 2021, Brandon University issued a statement criticizing Fleury for saying on Twitter that COVID-19 vaccine passports would be used by pedophiles to track children, calling the comment &quot;a stain on his legacy.&quot; The university had previously granted Fleury an honorary degree in 2015. Fleury has also promoted the &quot;Great Reset&quot; conspiracy theory.

In 2018, Fleury was a guest speaker at a fundraising event for the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island. He is a member of the United Conservative Party and endorsed Brian Jean for party leadership in 2017. He endorsed Danielle Smith during the 2022 UCP leadership race. In the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, Fleury endorsed and joined the campaign of Joseph Bourgault.

During the 2023 wildfires across Canada, Fleury claimed that progressives were weaponizing the wildfires to force &quot;climate lockdowns&quot; onto the masses.

== Business ventures ==
In 1994, Fleury joined a group that involved his former junior coach, Graham James, fellow NHL player Joe Sakic, and professional wrestler Bret Hart as a minority owner of the expansion Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League. He sold his share of the team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James&#x27; conviction for sexually abusing Sheldon Kennedy and another player.

After returning from the United Kingdom, he operated Fleury&#x27;s Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009. He filmed a pilot episode in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called &quot;Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid&quot;: &quot;We want to show people that if you have a dream, anything is possible with a little ambition,&quot; Fleury said of the show. It was not picked up by any network.

The 2008 launch of clothing line &quot;FAKE&quot; (Fleury&#x27;s Artistic Kustom Enterprises) led him to approach the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League in the hope of convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys. The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt.

He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a single in a pinch-hit appearance against the Yuma Scorpions. He started the second game at left field and struck out twice before he was replaced. &quot;I&#x27;ve had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself with the things I&#x27;ve done, the things I&#x27;ve accomplished. This was just another one of those days,&quot; Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers.

===Country music career===
In September 2015, it was announced through Fleury&#x27;s Twitter he was working on a country music record to be released in the fall of 2015. He released his first single titled &quot;My Life&#x27;s Been a Country Song&quot; and it reached more than 20,000 plays on SoundCloud within the first 24 hours of being released. His debut record, &quot;I Am Who I Am,&quot; was released on October 16, 2015, through eOne Music Canada.

Fleury said his country music ambitions had been a six-year process and he received vocal and performance training from music industry professionals. He collaborated with long-time friends Phil Deschambault and Paddy McCallion and together wrote more than 30 songs worth of material that would be later cut to ten songs for the album.

In 2017, Fleury wrote a song, &quot;Longshot&quot;, for the video game &quot;Madden NFL 18&quot; story mode of the same name.

Fleury has also received the honorary Siksika Nation Chief and an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Guelph-Humber for outstanding contributions to the mental health of Canadians.

<text>Galanta (, ) is a town with about 15,000 inhabitants in the Trnava Region of Slovakia. It is situated 50 km due east of the Slovak capital Bratislava.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from a Slavic name &quot;Golęta&quot; (initially a collective name of a youth group selected from a kin and responsible for guarding). A pre-Hungarian origin of the settlement is documented by the Proto-Slavic nasal &quot;ę&quot; conserved in the name (GalaNta; compare with Czech Holetín and Holetice).

==Geography==
Galanta lies in the Danubian Lowland (&quot;Podunajská nížina&quot;), the warm southern part of Slovakia. There are many agricultural fields around Galanta, where wheat, corn, and other vegetables and fruits are grown.

==History==
The area around Galanta has been inhabited almost continuously since the Neolithic. From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The first written record of Galanta is from 1237 in a Royal Decree by Béla IV of Hungary. Through the years, the settlement was under the lordship of various noble families including the Esterházy de Galantha and the Fekete de Galantha. Beginning in 1421, the Eszterházy family ruled the town and the surrounding area. In 1613 or 1614, Galanta was promoted to a free market town. Before the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, Galanta was part of Pozsony County. After the break-up of Austria-Hungary in 1918/1920, the town became part of the newly created Czechoslovakia. As a result of the First Vienna Award, it returned to Hungary between 1938 and 1945. On 31 March 1945, Galanta was captured by troops of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front and became again part of Czechoslovakia.

==Features==
Galanta is an old town where most historical buildings have unfortunately been damaged or destroyed in World War II. During the Communist era of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989) the architecture of the town has further deteriorated as historic buildings were razed and replaced by prefabricated concrete apartment complexes and buildings. There are two important historical buildings left. The first one is Esterházys&#x27; Neo-Gothic Castle and the second one is the Renaissance castle (the two are often referred to as manor houses rather than castles). The Esterházys&#x27; Neo-Gothic Castle is in a state of disrepair and has been closed to the public since the late 1980s. The Renaissance castle was renovated in the 1990s and is being used as a museum, exhibition space and cultural center.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, the town had 15,052 inhabitants. 60.07% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 27.72% Hungarians, 0.17% Roma and 0.50% Czechs. The religious makeup was 49.72% Roman Catholics, 32.62% people with no religious affiliation and 4.07% Lutherans.

In 1910, 89.6% of the population reported Hungarian as primary language, 6.2% Slovak, 3.5% German or Yiddish. The religious make-up was 65.3% Roman Catholic, 32.4% Jewish and 1.3% Lutheran.

==Notable citizens==
The Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály spent most of his childhood in this town and composed the &quot;Dances of Galánta&quot; (1933, for orchestra) based on the folk music of this region.

== Famous people ==
* František Valábek (*1907 – † 1980), SDB, Roman Catholic priest end religious prisoner (sentenced to 6 years in prison).

<text>Earl of Hereford is a title in the ancient feudal nobility of England, encompassing the region of Herefordshire, England. It was created six times.

The title is an ancient one. In 1042, Godwin, Earl of Wessex severed the territory of Herefordshire and its Welsh dependencies from the Kingdom of Mercia. He immediately granted it to his eldest son Sweyn Godwinson. The earldom included the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Somerset. In 1047, Sweyn attempted to take Eadgifu, Abbess of Leominster, from her nunnery by force with the intention of marrying her. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury and King Edward the Confessor intervened and stopped him. As punishment, King Edward banished Sweyn from England.

In 1049, Sweyn returned to England seeking forgiveness, supported by his cousin Beorn Estrithson. However, a disagreement arose and Sweyn murdered his cousin, resulting in his exile once more. He was deemed &quot;a man of no honour&quot;. In 1050, Sweyn was pardoned for his crimes and had the earldom restored to him, despite his violent acts. In 1051, Sweyn was exiled again together with his father and brothers and forfeited the earldom.

In 1052, King Edward granted the earldom to Ralph the Timid. In 1055, Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn invaded Herefordshire and Ralph met the Welsh army at Hereford. Fearing defeat, Ralph fled with the French and Norman soldiers, causing the surrounding area to fall under Welsh control. Between 1055 and 1057, Harold Godwinson retook the county with another force. Ralph died in 1057, leaving his young son Harold as heir. In 1066, William FitzOsbern supported the Norman Conquest of England. As reward, he was granted the Isle of Wight. In 1067, William was also granted the earldom of Hereford, and took on roles as chief administrator of Northern England. He oversaw the building of numerous castles.

Between 1070 and 1071, William FitzOsbern was delegated to govern England while William the Conqueror was away for Normandy. When the Count of Flanders died, his widow Richilde, Countess of Hainaut offered her hand in marriage to FitzOsbern for assistance against challenges to her power. However, FitzOsbern sought to gain control of the wealthy Flanders territory near Normandy. He rushed there with his army but was killed in the Battle of Cassel, leaving his son Roger de Breteuil as the new earl.

In 1075, Roger conspired with his brother-in-law Ralph Guader, Earl of Norfolk while the Conqueror was again absent in Normandy. They raised an army but were prevented from crossing the River Severn by local bishops and defeated at Fagadune. When the Conqueror returned, Roger was tried for treason before the Magnum Concilium and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment, while his soldiers had their right foot amputated. All his lands were also forfeited.

Roger died in prison in 1087, leaving two sons Reynold and Roger. Neither inherited the earldom, though they later fought successfully for King Henry I. After 1135, in the absence of an earl, King Stephen granted the earldom to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester and grandson of the previous earl, Roger. As part of this grant, Robert was instructed to use the city and castle of Hereford as another stronghold in the Midlands region. In 1141, the Empress Maud granted the earldom to Miles FitzWalter, hereditary High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, for his faithful service during her claim to the crown. He rebuilt Gloucester Castle, while Empress Maud lived at his expense in England. She granted him Abergavenny Castle as well in 1142.

In 1143, Miles FitzWalter demanded large sums from the Church while desperately short of money to pay his troops. The Bishop of Hereford resisted Miles&#x27; demands, so when Miles invaded church lands he was excommunicated. Miles died in a hunting accident at Christmas, leaving his son Roger FitzMiles as the new earl. Roger inherited his father&#x27;s roles as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, Castellan of Gloucester Castle, and Constable of England. He was troubled by his father&#x27;s death as an excommunicate and continued pressing the Bishop, eventually receiving excommunication himself.

In 1151, the devout Roger founded the Abbey of Flaxley in Gloucester and supported other monasteries. However, in 1155 a dispute arose with King Henry II over Gloucester Castle, which Roger surrendered along with his earldom. King Henry regranted the earldom to Roger, who then took monastic vows at Gloucester Abbey.

Roger died without heirs, leaving his brother Walter of Hereford to inherit. But before Walter could assume his titles, he joined a rebellion against King Henry. As punishment, the king stripped Gloucester city and the earldom of Hereford from Walter&#x27;s inheritance. Walter then died childless, followed by his brothers Henry and Mahel of Hereford in border conflicts and an accident respectively. With no male heirs, their estates passed to their three sisters: Margeret of Hereford, Bertha of Hereford and Lucy.

The eldest sister Margeret was married to Humphrey II de Bohun. In recognition of this marriage, King Henry granted Humphrey the earldom of Hereford. He also inherited two-thirds of the family estates and the prestigious hereditary office of Constable of England. Humphrey held the high position of Lord High Steward, above the Lord Chancellor.

Upon Humphrey&#x27;s death in 1165, their son Humphrey III de Bohun succeeded him. Before 1172, he successfully claimed the title of Constable of England from the Gloucester family, consolidating his inherited powers. Between 1171-1175, Humphrey married Margaret of Huntingdon, widow of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany and granddaughter of King David I of Scotland.

Between 1181-1187, Humphrey accompanied King Henry, leading an army against the Count of Flanders in support of King Philip II of France. However, he died abroad, leaving his son Henry de Bohun to inherit. In 1200, King John elevated Henry&#x27;s status by conferring the now-extinct title of Earl of Hereford, in the Peerage of England, upon him at Porchester. However, the king retained the revenue and feudal control of the earldom. Henry was instead granted an annuity, and all future earls were peers rather than holding the feudal title.

<text>John Sargrove (1906–1974) was a British engineer and automation pioneer.

== Life and career ==

His parents were ethnically Hungarian, and he was originally named John Adolphe Szabadi, but changed his name to Sargrove in 1938.

While employed at British Tungsram Radio Works Ltd (originally British Tungsram Electric Lamps Ltd) he experimented with the idea of creating circuits by spraying metal onto bakelite. He was able to create resistors, capacitors, and inductors, as well as the electrical connections between them, on a single bakelite blank by this process. This work was carried out around 1936 and 1937, several years prior to the development of the printed circuit board by Paul Eisler in 1943. Sargrove also experimented with the development of a &#x27;universal&#x27; vacuum tube. His long-term goal, however, was automating the production of radios by the development of what he termed Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME).

By 1947 Sargrove had completed the design of all the ECME, and formed a company, Sargrove Electronics Ltd, to build the equipment and then produce radios. The ECME built by Sargrove produced all of the radio circuitry by the sprayed-circuit process, and assembled all of the radio parts except for inserting the vacuum tubes into their sockets and attaching the speaker, thus greatly reducing the amount of human labour required and thereby lowering the cost of the radios. An ECME device could produce three radios a minute, and even test the radio circuitry.

Sargrove continued to design increasingly sophisticated ECME to produce more complex radios, and began work on ECME for the production of televisions. However, a large order of radios by the Indian government was cancelled in 1947 following Indian self-governance, and investors withdrew their backing of Sargrove Electronics Ltd, which then went into liquidation.

<doc id="797238" wikidata="Q5133088" url="?curid=797238" title="Clifford–Klein form">
<text>In mathematics, a Clifford–Klein form is a double coset space

where &quot;G&quot; is a reductive Lie group, &quot;H&quot; a closed subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, and Γ a discrete subgroup of G that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether can be taken to be a compact space, called a compact Clifford–Klein form.

When &quot;H&quot; is itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.

==History==
According to Moritz Epple, the Clifford-Klein forms began when W. K. Clifford used quaternions to &quot;twist&quot; their space. &quot;Every twist possessed a space-filling family of invariant lines&quot;, the Clifford parallels. They formed &quot;a particular structure embedded in elliptic 3-space&quot;, the Clifford surface, which demonstrated that &quot;the same local geometry may be tied to spaces that are globally different.&quot; Wilhelm Killing thought that for free mobility of rigid bodies there are four spaces: Euclidean, hyperbolic, elliptic and spherical. They are spaces of constant curvature but constant curvature differs from free mobility: it is local, the other is both local and global. Killing&#x27;s contribution to Clifford-Klein space forms involved formulation in terms of groups, finding new classes of examples, and consideration of the scientific relevance of spaces of constant curvature. He took up the task to develop physical theories of CK space forms. Karl Schwarzchild wrote “The admissible measure of the curvature of space”, and noted in an appendix that physical space may actually be a non-standard space of constant curvature.

<doc id="797246" wikidata="Q6979330" url="?curid=797246" title="National Voter Registration Act of 1993">
<text>The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), also known as the Motor Voter Act, is a United States federal law signed into law by President Bill Clinton on May 20, 1993, that came into effect on January 1, 1995. The law was enacted under the Elections Clause of the United States Constitution and advances voting rights in the United States by requiring state governments to offer simplified voter registration processes for any eligible person who applies for or renews a driver&#x27;s license or applies for public assistance, and requiring the United States Postal Service to mail election materials of a state as if the state is a nonprofit. The law requires states to register applicants that use a federal voter registration form, and prohibits states from removing registered voters from the voter rolls unless certain criteria are met.

The act exempts from its requirements states that have continuously since August 1, 1994 not required voter registration for federal elections or offered election day registration (EDR) for federal general elections. Six states qualify for the exemption: North Dakota, which does not require registration, and Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming because of the EDR exemption. While some have recently asserted that Maine lost the exemption when it abolished EDR in 2011 (which it subsequently restored), Maine has never considered itself exempt from the act.   

==Background==
After Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to address rampant voting discrimination against racial minorities, voting rights advocates argued for federal legislation to remove other barriers to voter registration in the United States. In the early 1970s, Congress considered several proposals to require the U.S. Census Bureau to mail voter registration forms to every household, none of which passed. In the mid and late 1970s, proposals to require certain public agency offices to make voter registration forms available and to require states to allow Election Day voter registration failed.

Congress passed two pieces of legislation in the 1980s that made voter registration for federal elections more accessible for certain disadvantaged populations. The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 requires states to make available to elderly and disabled voters &quot;a reasonable number of accessible permanent registration facilities&quot; and registration aids. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 requires states to mail federal voter registration forms to overseas and military voters and permit them to register by mail.

In the light of low voter turnout in federal elections in the 1980s, Congress returned its attention to creating general voter registration standards in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Member of Congress introduced a series of &quot;motor voter&quot; bills to require state motor vehicle agencies to offer voter registration opportunities to persons applying for a driver&#x27;s license. The first of these bills, the proposed National Voter Registration Act of 1989, passed in the House of Representatives with bipartisan support, but failed to pass in the Senate. A similar bill in 1991 [Introduced by Congressman Al Swift] gained less bipartisan support; it passed in both the Senate and the House but was vetoed by President George H. W. Bush. Two years later, Congress passed a nearly identical bill: the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.

==Scope and exemption==
The act formally applies only to federal elections. However, because states have unified their voter registration systems for state and federal elections, the provisions functionally apply to both federal and state elections.

The act exempts from its requirements states that have continuously, since 1 August 1994, not required voter registration for federal elections or offered election day registration (EDR) for federal general elections. Six states qualify for exemption from the act: North Dakota, which does not require registration, while Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming because of the EDR exemption. (Maine lost the exemption when it abolished EDR in 2011, although EDR was subsequently restored in that state. Several states have since August 1994 adopted some form of EDR, but these states are nevertheless subject to the act.)

==Provisions==

===Federal voter registration form===
The NVRA requires States to &quot;accept and use&quot; a uniform federal form to register voters for federal elections. The National Mail Voter Registration Form (commonly referred to as the &quot;Federal Form&quot;) was developed by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), but an amendment in the Help America Vote Act of 2002 transferred the FEC&#x27;s responsibilities under the NVRA to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). The federal form can be used by voter registration applicants as an alternative to state voter registration forms. The federal form requires that an applicant say, under penalty of perjury, various matters including that he or she is a citizen.

Between 2004 and 2013, Arizona required voter-registration officials to &quot;reject&quot; any application for registration, including a federal form, that was not accompanied by documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate. A group of Arizona residents and a group of nonprofit organizations challenged this Arizona law in federal court. The District Court ruled in favour of the Arizona law. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state&#x27;s documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement was disallowed by the federal act. On June 17, 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled against Arizona in &quot;Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc.&quot; (2013). In a 7–2 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court held that the NVRA&#x27;s mandate that states &quot;accept and use&quot; the federal form disallowed Arizona&#x27;s documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement.

===Voter registration of driver&#x27;s license applicants===
Section 5 of the act requires state motor vehicle offices to provide an opportunity for voter registration to anyone at the same time that they apply for a new or renewed driver&#x27;s license or state identification card, and to require the state to forward the completed application to the appropriate state or local election official.

The act reduces costs to the state of voter registration by accumulating individual data when applying for a drivers license or receiving social assistance. The &quot;motor voter&quot; nickname came from the idea that most of the NVRA data was accumulated from applicants renewing or obtaining driver&#x27;s licenses.

===Voter registration at agencies providing public assistance===
Section 7 of the act requires state agencies that provide public assistanceincluding those that administer federal assistance programs, such as food stamps, Medicaid, TANF, and WIC, and disability officesto assist their applicants and clients in registering to vote during the application process. Each applicant for any of these services, renewal of services, or address changes must be provided with a voter registration form as well as assistance in completing the form and forwarding the completed application to the appropriate State or local election official.

The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) is responsible for administering NVRA for U.S. citizens abroad. FVAP allows eligible citizens to register to vote at 6,000 Armed Forces recruitment offices nationwide.

===Mail voter registration===
Section 6 of the act allows voter registration applicants to submit their voter registration forms by mail. It provides that citizens can register to vote by mail using mail-in-forms developed by each state and the Election Assistance Commission.

In 2004, the Nu Mu Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity held a voter registration drive in DeKalb County, Georgia, from which Georgia secretary of state Cathy Cox (Dem.) rejected all 63 voter registration applications on the basis that the fraternity did not follow correct procedures, including obtaining specific pre-clearance from the state to conduct their drive. Nu Mu Lambda filed &quot;Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox&quot; (&quot;Wesley v. Cox&quot;) on the basis that Georgia&#x27;s long-standing policy and practice of rejecting mail-in voter registration applications that were submitted in bundles, by persons other than registrars, deputy registrars, or &quot;authorized persons&quot;, violated the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act by undermining voter registration drives. A senior U.S. district judge upheld earlier federal court decisions in the case, which also found private entities have a right, under the federal law, to engage in organized voter registration activity in Georgia at times and locations of their choosing, without the presence or permission of state or local election officials.

===Other provisions===
Section 8 of the act sets out requirements for how states maintain voter registration lists for federal elections. The act deems as timely those valid voter registration applications by eligible applicants submitted to designated state and local officials, or postmarked if submitted by mail, at least 30 days before a federal election. The act also requires the notification of all applicants of whether their voter registration applications were accepted or rejected.

The act requires states to keep voter registration lists accurate and current, such as identifying persons who have become ineligible due to having died or moved outside the jurisdiction. At the same time, the act requires list maintenance programs to incorporate specific safeguards, e.g., they must be uniform, non-discriminatory, in compliance with the Voting Rights Act, and not be undertaken within 90 days of a federal election.

The removal of voters for non-voting or for having moved can only be done after meeting the requirements set out in the act. Voters can be removed from registration lists when they have been convicted of a disqualifying crime or adjudged mentally incapacitated, where such removals are allowed by state law. The NVRA also provides additional safeguards under which registered voters would be able to vote notwithstanding a change in address in certain circumstances, such as when a voter has move within a district or a precinct will retain the right to vote even if they have not re-registered at their new address.

==Compliance==
Voting rights organizations have argued that many states have not been complying with the NVRA. In several states, organizations such as Demos, Project Vote, Campaign Legal Center and Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law have filed lawsuits or sent pre-litigation letters. In some of these cases, this has resulted in changes in compliance.

<text>CrossCrypt is an open-source on-the-fly encryption program for the Microsoft Windows XP/2000 operating systems. CrossCrypt allows a user to make virtual drives which encrypt any files stored on them, making the encryption process seamless to the user.

CrossCrypt is based on FileDisk, virtual disk driver for Windows NT/2000/XP that uses one or more files to emulate physical disks, adding encrypted volumes functionality.

==Features==

Application operates on .IMG file format disk images.

The format of CrossCrypt container files is fully compatible with one of the older Linux loop-AES device formats., they can be used under both Windows and Linux.

Although a GUI has been created for CrossCrypt (i.e. CrossCryptGUI ), CrossCrypt on its own operates without a GUI using a command line interface. One advantage being its small size; as it&#x27;s composed of only a single driver in *.sys format (43 Kb) and one command line or GUI executable (*.exe) (96 Kb). It does not have any installer.

===CD/DVD encryption===

The application is capable of encrypting CD/DVD images (.ISO). After burning it with any writing application disk looks blank when inserted into normal CD/DVD reading device (though, when mounted with the CrossCrypt application the state does not change, files are accessed in a new virtual drive).

==Encryption algorithms==

The encryption algorithms supported by CrossCrypt include AES (256, 192, 128; SingleKey Mode aes-loop compatible) and TwoFish (160 Bit Key; SuSE Linux compatible).

<doc id="797259" wikidata="Q7712746" url="?curid=797259" title="The Aesthetics of Rock">
<text>&quot;The Aesthetics of Rock&quot; is a book by Richard Meltzer (born May 10, 1945). Written between 1965 and 1968, it was first published in 1970 by Something Else Press. In 1987, Da Capo Press published an unabridged second edition, with a new foreword by Meltzer. It is one of the first major works of rock-music criticism and analysis. He wrote it as an undergraduate at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and as a graduate student at Yale University, from which he was, as he relates in his foreword, &quot;kicked out toot-sweet on my rock-roll caboose&quot; for writing papers with rock-music themes for philosophy classes.

Writer Greil Marcus, in his introduction to the Da Capo edition of &quot;Aesthetics&quot;, maintains that the book is &quot;the best and most obsessive book about the Beatles ever written,&quot; and that the work seeks to illuminate &quot;the collapse of art into everyday life, and vice versa.&quot;

<text>OpenText Corporation (styled as opentext) is a Canadian Information company that develops and sells enterprise information management (EIM) software.

OpenText, headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, is Canada&#x27;s fourth-largest software company as of 2022, and recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s top 100 employers 2016 by Mediacorp Canada Inc.

OpenText software applications manage content and unstructured data for large companies, government agencies, and professional service firms. OpenText aims its products at addressing information management requirements, including management of large volumes of content, compliance with regulatory requirements, and mobile and online experience management.

OpenText employs 22,900 people worldwide, and is a publicly traded company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ (OTEX).

==History==
Timothy Bray, with University of Waterloo professors Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet, founded OpenText Corporation in 1991. It grew out of OpenText Systems Inc., founded in 1989. The founders spun the company off from a University of Waterloo project that developed technology to index the Oxford English Dictionary.

Key people involved later include Tom Jenkins, who joined the company as COO in 1994. Tom Jenkins later became president and chief executive officer, and has been Executive Chairman since 2013. John Shackleton served as president from 1998 to 2011, and as CEO from 2005 to 2011. Mark Barrenechea has been president and CEO of OpenText since 2012. Mark Barrenechea was named Canadian Business CEO of the year in 2015. From January 2016, Steve Murphy served as the President; however, the company eliminated the position in Q1 2017.

OpenText is a supporter of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus, contributing both funds and in-kind services to the school.

In July 2020, OpenText partnered with cybersecurity company NINJIO. The collaboration strengthens security awareness with videos showcasing detection of phishing emails and inappropriate URLs.

==Acquisitions==
OpenText has acquired several businesses over the past two decades, beginning with IXOS Software AG in 2003, followed by Artesia in 2004. Other notable acquisitions include Hummingbird Ltd. in 2006 for $489 million, Captaris Inc. in 2008 for $131 million, and Vignette Corporation in 2009 for $321 million in cash and stock.

In the early 2010s, it acquired EasyLink (2012) for $232 million and GXS Inc., integrating the latter into the OpenText Business Network, which later acquired Inovis. In 2014, OpenText purchased Cordys for $33 million and Actuate of San Mateo, California. The following year, it acquired Daegis for $13.5 million.

On September 12, 2016, OpenText further expanded its share of the enterprise content management software market by buying that division of Dell EMC, which included Documentum, for US$1.6 billion. OpenText had originally had Documentum and Hummingbird, Ltd., as its chief competitors in this space, but this acquisition brought the long-time third competitor in Documentum under one corporate roof. Also in 2016, OpenText acquired Recommind after previously engaging with the company as a strategic partner.

In 2017, OpenText acquired Guidance Software for US$240 million, and Covisint for US$103 million, which they integrated into their OpenText Business Network. In 2018, OpenText acquired Liaison Technologies for US$310 million and integrated into their OpenText ALLOY Platform.

In 2019, OpenText acquired Catalyst Repository Systems, and then acquired Carbonite Inc. (including Webroot and Mozy, which Carbonite Inc. had earlier acquired) for approximately US$1.45 billion. In 2020, OpenText acquired Xmedius for US$75 million.

In 2021, OpenText announced planned acquisition of Zix Corp for US$860 million, and in November, OpenText completed the acquisition of Bricata enabling next-generation Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) technology to the OpenText Security and Protection Cloud.

In 2022, OpenText announced it would acquire British software firm Micro Focus in a deal valued at US$6billion, which finalized in January 2023.

== Products ==
OpenText&#x27;s products include enterprise content management (OpenText Content Suite, OpenText Extended ECM, OpenText Documentum), Business Network, customer experience management (OpenText Customer Experience Platform), digital process automation (OpenText AppWorks), discovery (OpenText Axcelerate eDiscovery and Investigations), security (OpenText EnCase Forensic Security Suite, OpenText Carbonite and Webroot solutions, OpenText NetIQ, OpenText ArcSight, OpenText Voltage, OpenText Fortify), and AI and analytics (OpenText Magellan Product Suite).

OpenText announced cloud-native containerized versions of many of the company&#x27;s software applications in April 2020.

=== Documentum ===

OpenText Documentum is an information management platform, named after the company Documentum that originally developed the software suite. In 2003, EMC acquired Documentum for $1.7 billion. In 2016, EMC was acquired by Dell, becoming Dell EMC. Subsequently, all of the Documentum intellectual property was sold to OpenText Corporation.

=== Document Server Alchemy Edition ===

Rebranded product resulting from the acquisition of Captaris

=== Content Suite Platform ===
In 1996, the product originally called &quot;Livelink&quot; became OpenText&#x27;s. Between 2003 and 2005, &quot;Livelink&quot; evolved from being the name of a single product to being a brand applied to the names of several OpenText software products. As a result of this change, &quot;Livelink Server&quot; became known as &quot;Livelink Enterprise Server&quot; (LES) and later &quot;Livelink ECM. In 2012, OpenText introduced the OpenText Content Suite. Then the technology component formerly known as Livelink ECM - Enterprise Server became known as &quot;OpenText Content Server&quot;, which is now a key component of OpenText Content Suite Platform.

=== Archive Center (Archive Server) === 
First released in May 2006, Livelink Enterprise Archive (LEA) became Archive Server in 2010. It is a key product in the Extended ECM scenario. With Version 16, the Archive Server was renamed to Archive Center.

=== Magellan ===
In July 2017, OpenText launched its artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics platform, OpenText Magellan, at the company&#x27;s Enterprise World conference. The platform combines open source machine learning with advanced analysis and is able to merge, manage, and analyse both structure data and unstructured, textual content. It offers machine-assisted decision-making, automation, and business optimization in a scalable, flexible solution.

=== RightFax ===
OpenText RightFax provides network-based fax functionality to enterprise organizations and has evolved through many versions since it was first released in 1992.

===RedDot and content authoring===

RedDot, founded in 1993, was a business unit of OpenText Corporation that the company refers to as the &quot;Web Solutions Group&quot;. The software assists in the management of content, with regulatory compliance and industry specific requirements.

Its core product, RedDot CMS is a Windows-based server application that provides Web content management in a multi-user environment. Complementary to the CMS or as a standalone product, LiveServer aggregates disparate document resources and serves them as Web pages.

Red dots on the authoring interface indicated sections of editable content for each web page, hence the name RedDot for the product. This feature was popular with customers and won awards in 2001 for its usability. By 2006, RedDot was one of the few WCM vendors that continued to develop their own content authoring interface. Most other WCM vendors had moved to open source alternatives, or had licensed an online rich-text editor from commercial vendors such as Ephox or Ektron. In response to customer attempts to work around the limitations of the RedDot editor by installing other editors RedDot developed an integration layer to support CKeditor and Ephox EditLive! as alternative editors. In 2009, RedDot (rebranded the OpenText Web Solutions Group) made the Telerik RadEditor available alongside the existing RedDot editor for CMS 9.

After the acquisition of Vignette, Web Solutions was rebranded again to become OpenText Web Site Management.

===Intelligent Capture (formerly Captiva)===
Captiva Software became a subsidiary of OpenText in 2017. It makes software for document information processing and data capture from paper and electronic documents and provides related services. Information in the form of extracted content and files are acquired in the Captiva Solution and then delivered for storage or workflow into document management systems such as those from Documentum, OpenText, Microsoft, or IBM. In 2019, Captiva was rebranded as OpenText Intelligent Capture.

===AppEnhancer (formerly ApplicationXtender)===
AppEnhancer is a content management system that manages, organizes, and stores information from an application or as an extension to an existing application. The product was acquired during OpenText&#x27;s purchase of Dell EMC&#x27;s ECD (Enterprise Content Division) in 2017.

<text>Lake Katharine State Nature Preserve is located in Jackson County, Ohio, United States, just northwest of and outside the city of Jackson. It is owned and administered by the State Division of Natural Areas and Preserves and comprises .

The nature preserve is centered at Lake Katharine, an artificial lake. The valley is a small gorge, located in southerly extensions of the same geological series of rocks that forms the Hocking Hills Region. The bluffs are formed of weathering-resistant sandstone, including the blackhand sandstone.

The stream that drains the lake is a tributary of Little Salt Creek, which flows through the eastern end of the reserve.

This nature preserve represents the northernmost extension of some southern species, such as bigleaf magnolia (&quot;Magnolia macrophylla&quot;) and umbrella magnolia (&quot;Magnolia tripetala&quot;), but also includes more northerly species such as wolf-foot clubmoss (&quot;Lycopodium clavatum&quot;).

The preserve features three principal trails, the one-mile Calico Bush Trail, the two-mile Salt Creek Trail, and the 2.5-mile Pine Ridge Trail. Boating is allowed on the lake by written permit only. The western portion of the preserve is off-limits to visitors, and is reserved for scientific research.

<doc id="797272" wikidata="Q135329" url="?curid=797272" title="Ferdinand von Wrangel">
<text>Baron Ferdinand Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Wrangel (, tr. ; – ) was a Russia German (Baltic German) explorer and officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, Honorable Member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and a founder of the Russian Geographic Society. He is best known as the chief manager of the Russian-American Company and governor of the Russian settlements in present-day Alaska.

In English texts, &quot;Wrangel&quot; is sometimes spelled &quot;Vrangel&quot;, a transliteration from Russian, which more closely represents its pronunciation in German, or &quot;Wrangell&quot;.

==Biography==
Wrangel was born in Pskov, into the Baltic German nobility of the Wrangel family and was a distant nephew of Generalfeldmarschall Friedrich von Wrangel.

He graduated from the Naval Cadets College in 1815. He participated in Vasily Golovnin&#x27;s world cruise on the ship &quot;Kamchatka&quot; in 1817–1819 and belonged to the cohort of Baltic-German navigators who were instrumental in Imperial Russia&#x27;s maritime explorations.

===Kolymskaya expedition===
He was appointed in 1820 to command the Kolymskaya expedition to explore the Russian polar seas. Sailing from St. Petersburg, he arrived at Nizhnekolymsk on 2 November 1820, and early in 1821 journeyed to Cape Shelagskiy on sledges drawn by dogs. He sailed afterward up Kolyma River, advancing about 125 miles into the interior, through territory inhabited by the Yakuts. On 10 March 1822, he resumed his journey northward, and traveled 46 days on the ice, reaching 72° 2&#x27; north latitude. He left Nizhnekolymsk on 1 November 1823, and returned to St. Petersburg on 15 August 1824.

He established that north of the Kolyma River and Cape Shelagsky there was an open sea, not dry land, as people thought. Together with Fyodor Matyushkin and P. Kuzmin, Wrangel described the Siberian coastline from the Indigirka River to the Kolyuchinskaya Bay in the Chukchi Sea. (See Northeast Passage.) His expedition made a valuable research in glaciology, geomagnetics, and climatology and also collected data about natural resources and native population of that remote area.

===&quot;Krotky&quot; world voyage===
Having been promoted to commander, Wrangel led the Russian world voyage on the ship &quot;Krotky&quot; in 1825–1827. That voyage spent 8 days at Nuku Hiva, leaving when it was ambushed by local people. It also called at Hawai&#x27;i.

===Governor of Russian Alaska===
He was appointed chief manager of the Russian-American Company in 1829, effectively governor of its settlements in North America (present day Alaska). Wrangel was the first of a series of bachelor appointees to the office of governor who had to find a wife before assuming the duties in America, the Russian American Company rules having been changed in 1829. Prior to his departure for Russia&#x27;s American colonies, he was married to Elisabeth Theodora Natalie Karoline de Rossillon, daughter of Baron Wilhelm de Rossillon.

He traveled to his post early in 1829, by way of Siberia and Kamchatka. After thoroughly reforming the administration, he introduced the cultivation of the potato, opened and regulated the working of several mines, and urged upon the home government the organization of a fur company. He promoted investment, and sent out missionaries. He began a survey of the country, opened roads, built bridges and government buildings. He made geographical and ethnographical observations, which he embodied in a memoir to the navy department. Recalled in 1834, he returned by way of Mexico and the United States, where he visited several cities.

===Admiral===
Wrangel was promoted to rear admiral in 1837, and made director of the ship-timber department in the navy office, which he held for twelve years. He became vice-admiral in 1847, but resigned in 1849, and temporarily severed his connection with the navy to assume the presidency of the newly reorganized Russian-American Company. Wrangel had been a member of the board of directors of the Russian-American Company from 1840 to 1849.

In 1854 he re-entered active service and was made chief director of the hydrographical department of the navy He was the Minister of the Navy 1855–1857.

===Retirement and death===
Wrangel retired in 1864. He opposed the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. Wrangel wrote the book &quot;Journey along the northern coastline of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean&quot; and other books about the peoples of northwestern America.

He lived in his last years in Ruil (&quot;Roela&quot; in Estonian) in the eastern part of Estonia. The manor was bought by him in 1840 and he gave it to his wife as a gift. Wrangel died in Dorpat, Livonia. His final resting place is in Viru-Jaagupi cemetery.

==Writings==
An account of the physical observations during his first journey was published in German (Berlin, 1827), and also in German extracts from Wrangel&#x27;s journals, &quot;Reise längs der Nordküste von Sibirien und auf dem Eismeere in den Jahren 1820-1824&quot; (2 vols., Berlin, 1839), which was translated into English as &quot;Wrangell&#x27;s Expedition to the Polar Sea&quot; (2 vols., London, 1840). The complete report of the expedition appeared as &quot;Puteshestvie po severnym beregam Sibiri, po Ledovitomu Moryu, sovershennoe v 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823 i 1824 godakh&quot; (2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1841), and was translated into French with notes by Prince Galitzin, under the title &quot;Voyage sur les côtes septentrionales de la Sibérie et de la mer glaciale&quot; (2 vols., 1841). From the French version of the complete report an English one was made under the title &quot;A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea&quot; (2 vols., London, 1841). The book influenced Charles Darwin&#x27;s thinking on animal navigation, leading him to propose that humans and animals possess an innate ability for dead reckoning. Darwin wrote:

Wrangel also published:
* &quot;Ocherk puti iz Sitki v Sankt-Peterburg&quot; (Report of Travel from Sitka to St. Petersburg) (1836)
** French translation: &quot;Journal de voyage de Sitka à Saint Pétersbourg&quot; (Paris, 1836)
** English translation prepared from the French: &quot;Journal of a Voyage from Sitka to St. Petersburg&quot; (London, 1837)
* &quot;Nachrichten über die Russischen Besitzungen an der Nordwestküste America&#x27;s&quot; (2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1839)
** French translation: &quot;Renseignements statistiques et ethnographiques sur les possessions Russes de la côte Nord-Ouest de l&#x27;Amérique&quot; (Paris, 1839)
** English translation: &quot;Statistical and Ethnographical Notices on the Russian Possessions in North America&quot; (London, 1841)

==Ancestry &amp; Legacy==
Wrangel&#x27;s descendants Peter-Friedrich Krienitz and Hermann von Wrangell, from Germany visited Ferdinand von Wrangel&#x27;s last home and grave in Roela first in 1990. After the Estonian Restoration of Independence in 1991, they together created the Fondation von Wrangell on his behalf - a society to assist Estonian and Latvian schools in 1992. They also began to assist Estonian legal professionals to transition to the European legal system by creating Forum Academicum in Roela.

Ferdinand von Wrangel&#x27;s 200th birthday (29th Dec. 1996 in the old calendar and 1997 January 10 by the new calendar), was celebrated with scientific conferences, a pipe organ concert and exhibitions in the University of Tartu, the Estonian Maritime Museum and in Saint Petersburg. A series of notebooks „FvW in itinere“ was released by the Fondation von Wrangelli in Estonian, Russian and German to introduce his scientific legacy. Over the next 10 years his birthday was celebrated in Tartu with scientific presentations, coffee and kringel.

Pro Scola opened opportunity for Lääne-Virumaa language teachers to learn more about Germany and also gave large input extending Rakvere Reaalgümnaasium library with English and German books. Pro Scola ceased its activities in 2005 with final seminaries in Rakvere, Tartu and in Latvia.

<text>Enniscorthy () is the second-largest town in County Wexford, Ireland. The town is located on the picturesque River Slaney and in close proximity to the Blackstairs Mountains and Ireland&#x27;s longest beach, Curracloe. 

The Placenames Database of Ireland sheds no light on the origins of the town&#x27;s name. It may refer either to the &quot;Island of Corthaidh&quot; or the &quot;Island of Rocks&quot;. The cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns is located in the town as well as an array of other historical sites such as Enniscorthy Castle and the key battle site of the 1798 Rebellion.

At the 2022 census, the population of the urban area of Enniscorthy was 12,310. The town is twinned with Gimont, France.
==History==
===Enniscorthy Castle===
Enniscorthy Castle is an imposing Norman stronghold, which dates from 1205 and was a private dwelling until 1951. The castle was built by the DePrendergasts. In the early 1580s, the poet Edmund Spenser leased the property that included the castle.

The castle was also once owned by Sir Henry Wallop. The castle was the site of many fierce battles during the Cromwellian years and also during the 1798 Rising. The castle houses the Wexford County Museum, which contains extensive 1798 rebellion-related material, as well as items of local and agricultural interest. It was closed for major refurbishment from 2007 until May 2011.

=== Vinegar Hill ===

Vinegar Hill (&quot;&quot; in Irish which translates as &#x27;hill of the berry-tree&#x27;), a pudding-shaped hill overlooking the town, was the largest camp and headquarters of the rebels of 1798 who controlled County Wexford for thirty days against vastly superior forces, before their defeat on 21 June. However, many managed to flee south through a gap left in the British lines by General Needham (now known as Needham&#x27;s Gap). During this time, Beauchamp Bagnell Harvey was declared President of the Wexford Republic.

===The National 1798 Rebellion Centre===

The National 1798 Rebellion Centre is devoted to the history and aftermath of the 1798 Rebellion, setting it in its European context. It is housed in the former Congregation of Christian Brothers monastery.
The Centre offers people the chance to see what famous figures were involved in the 1798 Rebellion.

===Saint Aidan&#x27;s Cathedral===

Following the relaxation of the Penal Laws at the beginning of the 19th century, it became possible for the Roman Catholic community to consider building a cathedral to replace the one in Ferns that had been appropriated for use by the Church of Ireland during the English Reformation. Built in 1843, St. Aidan&#x27;s Cathedral was designed by Augustus Welby Pugin, famous for having designed London&#x27;s Houses of Parliament. The cathedral is in the same Neo-Gothic style. Notable features include the striking façade, a reredos carved from Caen stone and a great north window with intricate stone tracery. The cathedral was subsequently much renovated (in line with reforms promulgated by the Second Vatican Council). It was restored to its near original design in 1994 when authentic colours, materials and techniques were used. The restoration took a year, during which time cathedral services were held at St Mary&#x27;s church (Church of Ireland) nearby.

===1916 Rising===
In 1916 Enniscorthy patriots again took their place in history, when James Connolly requested that the Enniscorthy Volunteers take and hold the railway line to prevent reinforcements from reaching Dublin. 600 Volunteers took the town, led by Robert Brennan, Seamus Doyle and J R Etchingham, they surrounded the police station but did not attempt to take it. The RIC barracks was held by a police inspector and five constables while a RIC sergeant and one constable prevented the rebels from taking over a bank in the town. They established their headquarters at the Athenaeum, and held control until asked to surrender by Padraig Pearse.

The Volunteers also established a strong position on Vinegar Hill, overlooking the town. The railway line was cut and men dispatched to Gorey and Ferns. The government responded by sending a force of more than 1,000 men to retake Enniscorthy and the rebels retired to their positions on Vinegar Hill. Before hostilities could develop, the news of the Dublin surrender arrived, but the Volunteers refused to believe it. To avoid bloodshed, the army commander Col. F A French offered safe conduct for the Wexford leaders so that they could go to Dublin and hear of the surrender directly from Pearse. There were no fatalities.

===Early aviation===

The first successful flight from Britain to Ireland was made from Goodwick&#x27;s Harbour Village on 22 April 1912 by Denys Corbett Wilson, flying a Bleriot XI. The flight lasted one hour 40 minutes, with landfall near Enniscorthy, Ireland. The achievement was commemorated in Centenary Celebrations held in Fishguard and Goodwick on the weekend of 21/22 April 2012 and in a specially commissioned stage play by Derek Webb, called &#x27;100 Minutes&#x27; which was performed in Fishguard and Wexford the same week.

==Amenities==

Enniscorthy is situated by the River Slaney, and has riverside walks beside it to the north and to the south, on the west bank. Further walking trails are available nearby such Vinegar Hill, Ringwood Forest, Borodale Forest and Oulart Hill.

There is a swimming pool/recreation centre, several sports grounds including a rugby club, soccer clubs, GAA clubs and several hotels including the four-star Riverside Park Hotel and Leisure Club. Outside of the town, there is an 18-hole golf course, several pitch and putts, freshwater fishing, and a five-star spa, Monart Spa Hotel, is beside &quot;The Still Pond&quot;.

The town is also a base for adventure activity such as kayaking on the River Slaney, mountain biking on Bree Hill or hiking in the Blackstairs Mountains.

The town has a number of historical sites and museums as well as an Arts Centre and Theatre Groups.

It is the cathedral town of the Diocese of Ferns and has two Catholic churches spread over two parishes — St. Aidan&#x27;s and St Senan&#x27;s, under the shadow of Vinegar Hill.

Enniscorthy Market House was completed in the late 18th century.

==Events==

===Enniscorthy Arts Trail===
Established in 2018, Enniscorthy Arts Trail is an artist led initiative that sees vacant buildings in Enniscorthy town transformed and offered to visual artists as gallery spaces, workshop hubs, and cultural centres during the August Bank Holiday weekend. Enniscorthy Arts Trail also offers a number of tours and arts performances, hosted by St. Mary&#x27;s Church and The Presentation Centre.

===Enniscorthy Rockin&#x27; Food &amp; Fruit Festival===
The Enniscorthy Rockin&#x27; Food Festival has been an annual August Bank Holiday event in Enniscorthy since 2016. Now renamed the Rockin&#x27; Food &amp; Fruit Festival, it&#x27;s the highlight of the summer calendar in Enniscorthy, taking place over the August Bank Holiday Weekend. As always, the Rockin&#x27; Food &amp; Fruit Festival brings the very best in local food and fruit producers, family entertainment and as always, the best of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll. 

It primarily involves free outdoor 1950s/Rockabilly themed gigs, a trail of food and craft marquees, an artisan food market, and events and classes for adults and children. There are also food and drink workshops that run alongside the festival in local cafés and restaurants. Enniscorthy Rockin&#x27; Food Festival was born from the amalgamation of a number of smaller community festivals taking place in Enniscorthy. It was decided by a committee that there was demand for one larger festival combining all elements of the smaller community festivals.

The Blackstairs Blues festival is also an annual event and includes international and local performers, in a variety of late-night concerts and workshops.

==Education==
Enniscorthy has four second-level schools: Coláiste Bríde, St. Mary&#x27;s CBS, Enniscorthy Community College and Meánscoil Gharman and four primary schools – St. Aidan&#x27;s, St. Mary&#x27;s, St. Senan&#x27;s and Gaelscoil Inis Córthaidh. The town is also host to a range of high quality childcare options.

==Arts and entertainment ==

The town&#x27;s main visual arts and entertainment venue, the Presentation Arts Centre, is situated on the site of a former convent. Officially opened in 2012, it is a fully accessible multi-use arts venue which is developed and promoted by the Wexford Arts Centre and Wexford County Council. The Presentation Arts Centre&#x27;s theatre space retains most of the features of the original 19th century convent church, including original stained glass windows, ornate timber ceiling, original wishbone floor, and several decorative arches. The Presentation Arts Centre hosts numerous exhibitions per year, with particular emphasis on supporting and promoting emerging artists.

Enniscorthy is the home of the Wexford Carol, a Christmas song dating back to the 16th century or possibly much earlier.

In literature, Enniscorthy is mentioned in the Ithaca chapter of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; (p. 812) as a flyleaf note in a book belonging to Leopold Bloom, where it is described as &quot;Ennifcorthy, County Wexford, the finest place in the world&quot; (sic).

Enniscorthy is also the home of Eilis Lacey, the central character of the novel &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and its film adaptation. In the story, which is set in the early 1950s, Eilis travels alone from Enniscorthy to Brooklyn because of the lack of opportunities for her at home. Most, if not all, of the Enniscorthy scenes in the film were filmed in Enniscorthy, with multiple locations in the town being credited.

== Economy ==
The current economy of Enniscorthy is a mix of sectors including food production (such as Slaney Foods), engineering (such as Aircon Mech), ICT (such as Taoglas), financial services (such as Opus Funds), life sciences (such as Becton Dickinson), hospitality (such as Riverside Park Hotel) and construction (including high performance buildings through the NZEB Training Centre.

===Davies Distillery===
As early as 1824 Francis Davies, a miller, operated a spirit business from his mill in Enniscorthy. Davies then employed John Mullaly as a distiller. Mullaly had previously worked as a distiller with John McKenzie &amp; Co in Mill Street Belfast. When the temperance reformer Theobald Mathew campaigned against alcohol, many distilleries in Ireland closed. After the Davies distillery closed, Mullaly and his family cast their lots together and emigrated to Australia on the Salsette in 1840.

===George Killian&#x27;s Red===
Enniscorthy was the location of a regional microbrewery opened in 1864 and owned by the descendants of George Killian Lett. During their operation, Killian&#x27;s ale was sold almost entirely in Wexford county. GH Lett Company still operates today, but no longer brews its own products. They now focus on wholesale to shops, bars and hotels. Killian&#x27;s Red is still sold abroad, and the brand is currently held by Brasseries Pelforth, S. A.

===Pottery===
Carley&#x27;s Bridge Pottery is one of Ireland&#x27;s oldest potteries, having made earthen pots for over three hundred years. Paddy Murphy was also an Enniscorthy potter and in 1980 founded Hill View pottery adjacent to his home and close to Carley&#x27;s Bridge Pottery. The &quot;cul de sac&quot; &quot;Potters&#x27; Way&quot; is named after him — as he would walk that route to his home. Since his passing, Hill View pottery has been taken over by his relation Derek O&#x27;Rourke.

===Enterprise Centre===
Enniscorthy Enterprise &amp; Technology Centre provides business support, training and incubation space for start-ups and small and medium enterprises.

==Transport==
Enniscorthy is well connected by 121 km of motorway directly to Dublin. The Enniscorthy Bypass project, which was officially opened on 18 July 2019, also includes a single carriageway that connects the N30 with the M11, significantly reducing journey times to Waterford.

Enniscorthy railway station is on the Dublin–Rosslare line. The line terminates at Dublin Connolly in the northern direction, whilst in the southern direction it runs to Rosslare Europort, where it connects with the Stena Line ferry to Fishguard Harbour. There are also Irish Ferries connections from Rosslare Europort to Pembroke and Cherbourg. The station opened on 16 November 1863.
