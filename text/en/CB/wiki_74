<doc id="834197" wikidata="Q3020568" url="?curid=834197" title="Dead or Alive Ultimate">
<text>is a video game compilation developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo for the Xbox. It is a collection of the two previous games in the series, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;. It marks the first game in the series to be a compilation. &quot;DOA Ultimate&quot; contains a high-resolution edition of the Sega Saturn version of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, and an enhanced remake of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; which utilizes a new graphics engine and offers game mechanics, new game content and the inclusion of Hitomi as a playable character from &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; . The game offered online multiplayer capabilities, making the compilation among the first fighting games to offer online play. 

&quot;Ultimate&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised the games&#x27; online functionalities. In 2006, both games became backwards compatible on Xbox 360. In 2021, both games were made available to download on Xbox Live worldwide, and were later added to the list of backward compatible games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; is a compilation game that includes an enhanced version of &quot;Dead or Alive 1&quot; and a remade version of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;. The remade version of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; has re-developed graphics and new stages for the Xbox gaming system. The enhanced version of &quot;Dead or Alive 1&quot; is the original Sega Saturn version, with smoothed graphics, but lacks the additional content received in the later-released North American PlayStation version (no Bass or Ayane characters or extra costumes). Both editions include online play.

&quot;Dead or Alive 1 Ultimate&quot; is essentially identical to its original Sega Saturn version, and is generally considered more of a collector&#x27;s disc than for its content. &quot;Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate&quot;, being a remake created after the debut of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, takes elements and mechanics from both its original iteration and successor. The action of 3D-axis movement is as free-formatted as &quot;DOA3&quot;, and Hitomi is now a playable character albeit outside story mode. Other elements have been kept intact from &quot;DOA2&quot;. These include higher damaging counters than in &quot;DOA3&quot;, environmental hazards not warranting a knockout on a character, and a counter mechanism that is much harder to execute. Despite being able to freely move on a 3D axis in the &quot;Ultimate&quot; version of &quot;DOA2&quot; however, most moves cannot be sidestepped as in &quot;DOA3&quot; and other 3D fighters. Another major change is in the revamped holding system in &quot;DOA2 Ultimate&quot;. The final major set of changes instituted in &quot;2 Ultimate&quot; is the inclusion of slopes, which are a type of environmental hazard where those knocked down them roll down the slope, taking damage as they fall.

The game required Xbox Live in order to play online. The service&#x27;s support makes it the second online console fighting game to be released in America and Europe (&quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; having been the first) and the first online console fighting game in Japan. While Xbox Live for the original Xbox was discontinued in 2010, &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; is now playable online using the replacement Xbox Live servers called Insignia.

The system set forth by Tecmo for online play in &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; was intended to recreate the feel of playing at an arcade. Players would log onto a shared &quot;lobby&quot; and then observe other matches until it was their turn to participate. Each lobby has a set of gameplay parameters that is determined by its creator, allowing for tournament-style play.

While this game brings back the old mechanics of the Dreamcast version of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, some changes to the music and remixes were added. Each character except Hitomi (who was introduced in &quot;DOA3&quot;) has their own remix. The remixes only appear in the Dance Floor stage, The Ray House.

==Characters==

&quot;Ultimate&quot; features a total of 16 playable characters. &quot;Dead or Alive 1 Ultimate&quot; features a roster of 9 playable characters while &quot;Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate&quot; features a roster of 15 playable characters.


==Plot==

The story mode of &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; plays out as it did in the original games. However, a new CG opening sequence is added, further explaining the relationship and history of Mugen Tenshin ninjas, Kasumi, Ayane and Hayate, revealing the village they all hail from, Kasumi&#x27;s and Hayate&#x27;s father, Shiden, who was mentioned in the first &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, Ayane&#x27;s foster-father, Genra, before his monstrous transformation in &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, and introduces Ayame, mother of Kasumi, Hayate and Ayane. The sequence reveals the rape of Ayame by Kasumi&#x27;s and Hayate&#x27;s uncle, Raidou, leading to the birth of Ayane, her being raised by Genra, and Raidou&#x27;s crippling of Hayate, leading to Hayate&#x27;s comatose state and Kasumi&#x27;s quest for vengeance on Raidou. The CG sequence acts as a prologue leading into the first three &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; games.

==Development and release==

In 2004, after the release of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, Team Ninja once again remade &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, this time for the Xbox system. In the planning stages, this new game was originally named &quot;Dead or Alive Online&quot; for its addition of online support. On January 14, it was renamed to &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; and promised fresh content, additional characters, re-recorded voiceovers, and an upgraded version of the original &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; for the Sega Saturn. According to Tecmo, the name change was due to the opinion that &quot;Ultimate&quot; would more accurately describe the feeling players feel upon experiences with the game&quot;.

Hitomi from &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was added to the game roster as an unlockable character, and owning a copy of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; makes Hitomi accessible in &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; was released with a crystal-clear blue version of the Xbox system that included a controller of the same color, a copy of &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot;, and some bonus Kasumi-themed extras. In the United States, two trading cards with character pictures on them were randomly included in each game as part of a collector&#x27;s edition. The game disc of the North American release also contains the Booster Pack for the North American version of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, which adds numerous character costumes found in the European and Japanese versions of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;. This disc also included the G4-produced segment from their &quot;Icons&quot; series entitled &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, detailing the history of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, along with interviews featuring various people from the video game industry, including series creator Tomonobu Itagaki. A guide book titled &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate: Prima Official Game Guide&quot; by Prima Games was released on November 4, 2004. 

===Backwards Compatibility and Re-release===
With the December 14, 2006, backwards compatibility update for the Xbox 360, the Xbox release of &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; can now be played on the Xbox 360. On November 10, 2021, &quot;Dead or Alive 1 Ultimate&quot; and &quot;Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate&quot; became available to download separately on Xbox Live worldwide along with &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, hinting at the addition of the games to backward compatibility program. On November 15, 2021, all 3 games were added to the line up and became playable on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

==Reception==
&quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics with a score of 84.14% and 83/100 from review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 32 out of 40. 

&quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Hilary Golden praised its online functionality, stating how &quot;the online set-up goes well beyond what has been previously done for fighting games and betters some online first-person shooters to boot&quot;. Golden concluded that &quot;the greatly improved arenas, the plethora of costumes, the addition of slope moves, and the implementation of Xbox Live play makes &quot;DOA Ultimate&quot; one of the best games this year&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin called it &quot;a landmark achievement in the fighting game genre&#x27;s history-in-the-making&quot;, praising its innovative, impressive and well implemented online component, and praised how the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; gameplay formula held up well over the years. Kasavin criticized the gameplay being unchanged from years-old predecessors and the absence of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; characters &quot;Hayate&quot;, &quot;Christie&quot;, and &quot;Brad Wong&quot; from the roster, but concluded that &quot;For a game that&#x27;s so bold as to call itself &quot;Ultimate&quot;, &quot;DOAU&quot; sure comes close. It truly is the best, most fully featured title in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series yet&quot;.

===Sales and awards===
&quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; topped the Japanese charts on release, coming in number 4 during Week 45 in 2004. Prior to release, the game&#x27;s E3 presentation was awarded &quot;Best Non-Playable Xbox Presentation&quot; by &quot;IGN&quot;. After its release, it was awarded &quot;Fighting Game of the Year&quot; at the 2004 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards (NAVGTR Awards). &quot;IGN&quot; awarded the game &quot;Best Fighting Game of 2004&quot; and &quot;Best Xbox Graphics of 2004&quot; during their Best of 2004 awards. It also received a runner-up position in GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot; category across all platforms, losing to &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; was the first Japanese fighting game and the second fighting game after &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; to offer online multiplayer. &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot;&#x27;s online mode along with the online modes of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; and the Xbox version of &quot;Street Fighter Anniversary Collection&quot;, connected players of different regions together during the time the fighting game community (FGC) was in a state of stagnation. 

In 2005, &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; became the first fighting game to be included in the World Cyber Games.

<doc id="834201" wikidata="Q5172647" url="?curid=834201" title="Corpus Christi Fury">
<text>The Corpus Christi Fury (formerly the Corpus Christi Hammerheads), was a professional indoor football team based in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States. The Fury played its home games at the American Bank Center.

==History==
The Fury began life as the Corpus Christi Hammerheads, a charter member of the Intense Football League. The Hammerheads were coached by ex-University of Houston Quarterback and former IFL star Jason McKinley, son of former NFL player Bob McKinley, and were led by a strong supporting cast of players such as quarterback Wes Cooper, wide receiver Shomari Buchanan, tight end Matt Ross, and linebackers Roy Salas and DeAndrae Filmore. They played their home games at the Memorial Coliseum in 2004 and at the American Bank Center in 2005 and 2006, both of which are in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The team did not return to the American Bank Center for 2007 after the arena decided not to renew the team&#x27;s lease and it became the home of the af2 team, the Corpus Christi Sharks. In 2007, the Hammerheads played in the Central Pavilion Arena in nearby Robstown, Texas. In 2008, head coach Jason McKinley guided the Hammerheads back to the Intense Football League&#x27;s title game only to lose 65–36 in Lake Charles, Louisiana to the Louisiana Swashbucklers. After the Sharks folded following the 2009 season the Hammerheads announced they were returning to the American Bank Center for the upcoming 2010 season.

For the 2011 season, the Hammerheads joined the Southern Indoor Football League. Finishing at 7–5, the Hammerheads lost to the Louisiana Swashbucklers in the first round of the playoffs. After the 2011 season, the Hammerheads left the SIFL to help start the Lone Star Football League.

The team was removed from the Lone Star Football League following the 2012 season. In 2013, the team played in the Ultimate Indoor Football League and renamed as the &quot;Corpus Christi Fury&quot; (the logos were originally designed for a proposed 2012 UIFL expansion team, the &quot;Danville Dragons&quot;).

The fury fell to the Florida Tarpons in Ultimate Bowl III, but returned to the Ultimate Bowl in 2014. The team defeated the Tarpons 60–23 to claim their first championship in franchise history.

For the 2015 season, the Fury played in the X-League after the UIFL ceased operations. The Fury also was winless that season.

On October 1, 2015, the Fury joined American Indoor Football after the X-League folded. The team cancelled several games during the 2016 season and only played one game against another AIF member. While never announced by the team, the Fury appeared to have folded before their May 15, 2016, game against the New Mexico Stars, giving the Stars 24 hours&#x27; notice that they would be unable to make the game. They also announced their May 22 home game was cancelled over social media on the day of the game without explanation. 

The Fury were removed from the AIF website after the completion of the 2016 season. AIF also ceased all operations in July 2016. In October, a new indoor football team was announced to begin play in 2017 out of the American Bank Center called the Corpus Christi Rage. The new team had no connection to the former Hammerheads/Fury franchise and was a member of the new National Arena League. The Rage, however, also went winless and failed to complete the 2017 season. The Hammerheads hold the record for most Intense Bowls played, but lost all three games.

== Final roster &amp; standings==
On October 1, 2015, the Fury joined American Indoor Football from the recently folded X-League Indoor Football. The team&#x27;s coach remained LaDaniel Marshall working under general manager Robert Wehling and owner, Chad Dittman.

The team cancelled several games during the season and only played one game against an AIF member. While never announced by the team itself, the Fury appeared to have folded before their game on May 15 against the New Mexico Stars, giving the Stars 24 hours&#x27; notice that they would be unable to make the game. They also announced their May 22 home game was cancelled on the day of the game over social media without explanation.

<text>The Troll was a small car manufactured by Troll Plastik &amp; Bilindustri of Lunde, Norway, from 1956 to 1958. It was one of a few attempts at car production in Norway, and only five cars were built.

==Design==
The Troll was built as a 2+2 sports car with a fibreglass body, with the intention to build the first non-American mass-produced fibreglass car. In the US, Chevrolet made its Corvette in fibreglass, but no one in Europe had built cars in plastic, except for the East German Trabant, which was also a 2-cylinder two-stroke car. Fibreglass was a relatively new material in the late 1950s, but had numerous benefits, notably its inability to rust and its light weight (being approximately lighter than an equivalent metal-bodied car).

The Troll&#x27;s chassis was taken from a Gutbrod Superior, and the body was made longer to fit on it. Gutbrod also manufactured the Troll&#x27;s engine, which was a two-stroke straight-twin with Bosch fuel injection connected to a three-speed Hurth transmission. The engine produced , propelling the car to a top speed of approximately . The Troll was also capable of 5 litres per 100 km (47 mpg).

Due to the complex fuel injection system, there were plans to use a 3-cylinder Saab engine instead, which were never implemented.

==History==
===Development===
The Troll was developed by businessman Per Kohl-Larsen and engineers Bruno Falck and Erling Fjugstad, and designed by Hans Trippel.

The first car was revealed to the press in October 1956. It was not completely finished, and although the form of the chassis was final, the car could not be driven. This car was later used as a prototype, and many changes were made during later testing. Norwegian and foreign press showed much enthusiasm towards the project, and the car was compared to those from brands like Porsche, Citroën and Saab.

===Production and bankruptcy===
The first Troll was sold to a customer on May 1, 1957.

As production commenced, Kohl-Larsen faced difficulty obtaining a permit from the Norwegian government to sell the Troll. He was allowed to sell only 15 cars in Norway, the reason being a barter treaty Norway had with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to buy cars from them as they bought fish products from Norway. As such, the government was afraid that domestic car production would disrupt this trading balance. Kohl-Larsen therefore started plans to export cars to Germany and Denmark, with requests from other countries like Finland and Belgium. At one point, the company had plans to build 2,000 cars per year, but settled on one finished car per day afterwards.

Troll Plastik &amp; Bilindustri was also unable to secure the investment capital necessary for large-scale production. When the Norwegian government made their lack of support for the Troll clear, all potential investors closed negotiations, resulting in bankruptcy in early 1958.

<text>Graeme Craig Smith (born 1 February 1981) is a South African cricket commentator and former cricketer who played for South Africa in all formats. In 2003, he was appointed captain of the national team, taking over from Shaun Pollock. He held the position of test captain until his retirement in 2014. At 22, he was appointed as South Africa&#x27;s youngest ever captain. He was the most capped captain ever when he played his (personally not captained) 102nd test against England. He is considered as one of South Africa&#x27;s greatest ever captains having led South Africa to a record 54 test victories.

A tall, left-handed opening batsman, Smith is regarded as one of the greatest openers of all time. During South Africa&#x27;s tour of England in 2003, he made double centuries in consecutive Test matches: 277 at Edgbaston, and 259 at Lord&#x27;s. His 259 at Lord&#x27;s still holds the record for being the highest score made by a foreign player at this venue. On 24 October 2013, Smith became the second South African and 12th overall to complete 9,000 runs in test cricket in his 112th test match. His highest score in ODI cricket which was his 141 he made against England in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy is also the highest score made by a South African at any tournaments.

Known for the success of his opening partnership with Herschelle Gibbs, South Africa&#x27;s most prolific ever opening partnership, Smith has the distinction of having been part of all four of South Africa&#x27;s opening partnerships of over 300 runs: in three of them he was partnered by Gibbs, and in 2008 Smith added 415 for the first wicket with Neil McKenzie against Bangladesh, a world record opening partnership. On 3 March 2014, during the third Test against Australia, he announced his retirement from international cricket.

He was also the overseas player and captain of the English side Surrey. He appeared in his 100th Test against England on 19 July 2012. He captained his 100th career Test match on 1 February 2013, against Pakistan, on his 32nd birthday. He&#x27;s the only player to captain a side in 100 Tests.

On September 9, 2022, Smith and Kallis announced partnerships with MCW as official ambassadors for cricket.

Most recently, Graeme Smith has been appointed as the SA20 League Commissioner.

==Early and personal life==
Born and raised in Johannesburg to Scottish parents Graham and Janet, Smith was educated at King Edward VII School. Smith played three Tests, and seven One Day Internationals for South Africa under-19s, of which five were during the Under 19 Cricket World Cup. He scored one fifty in the test matches, but scored five half-centuries in the one-dayers. Smith was also one of the South African Cricketers of the Year in the South African Cricket Annual for his performances in the 2001–02 South African cricket season.

Smith married Irish singer Morgan Deane, at St Bernard Catholic Church in Claremont, Cape Town in August 2011. Their daughter, Cadence Christine Smith, was born 25 July 2012. and their son, Carter McMorrin Smith, was born on 15 July 2013. On 18 February 2015, Graeme and Morgan publicly announced that they would be divorcing after four years of marriage.
On 24 December 2016, Smith&#x27;s girlfriend Romy Lanfranchi gave birth to Smith&#x27;s third child, a boy.

Smith is also an ardent Liverpool F.C. supporter.

== Domestic career ==
Graeme Smith has played for several cricket teams in South Africa. He latterly played for the Cape Cobras but due to his international commitments, his appearances for them were limited, his last first-class game for them being in 2010. In total he has played 17 games for Western Province scoring 1,312 runs with four centuries at an average of 46.85. He has also played for other teams in South Africa including the United Cricket Board of South Africa Invitation XI and Western Province Boland.

He has also played county cricket for Somerset in the 2005 English cricket season, captaining the club for part of the 2005 season, and he scored a century in a tour match against the Australians in preparation for the 2005 Ashes series. Against Leicestershire at Taunton he scored his maiden first-class triple hundred (311 off 255 balls). He also hit 105 in the Twenty20 Cup match against Northamptonshire, which is currently the 15th highest score in the domestic Twenty20 Cup competition. Smith also captained the team to victory on finals day to secure the Twenty20 Cup trophy, making 64 not out from 47 balls in the final.

In 2008 Graeme Smith played in the inaugural Indian Premier League for Rajasthan Royals. His opening partnership with Swapnil Asnodkar achieved significant success. &quot;You can know an opponent as a cricketer,&quot; Royals captain Shane Warne, with whom Smith had had multiple dustups in the past, wrote afterward, &quot;but you only start to know him as a bloke when you play in the same side. As it turned out, the Graeme Smith I played alongside for the Rajasthan Royals in 2008 was different from the Graeme Smith I faced in the Test arena. That was the great thing about the Indian Premier League. It brought together players from all countries to share ideas, swap experiences, and take the game forward worldwide. We had a laugh and a joke about the things we had said in the past. They sounded quite funny looking back. I know he has a few regrets, but, all credit to him, he sees the funny side.&quot;

On 1 November 2012 Graeme Smith was announced as the new captain of Surrey County Cricket Club starting in the 2013 season.
He received his county cap at lunch on day 1 of the first championship fixture of the 2013 season against Somerset.

==International career==
Smith made his Test debut for South Africa in 2002 in Cape Town against Australia, batting at number three and scoring 68 in the second innings.
Promoted to open the batting with Herschelle Gibbs against Bangladesh in his third Test match, Smith scored 200. In the following home series against Pakistan, Smith (who scored 151) and Gibbs (228) shared a first-wicket stand of 368, a national record until bettered by Smith and Neil McKenzie&#x27;s 415, and at the time the fourth highest opening partnership in Test history.
Following the 2003 Cricket World Cup and Shaun Pollock&#x27;s subsequent resignation, Smith was selected as captain for South Africa&#x27;s next Test. The decision was criticised as it was felt that he had shown &#x27;few leadership credentials&#x27;: He had played only eight Test matches and 22 ODIs before being given the captaincy.
Graeme Smith was only 22 years and 82 days old when he captained his first match against Bangladesh, the youngest ever South African captain.

During the tour of England in 2003 he made double centuries in consecutive: 277 (and 85 from 70 balls in the second innings)
in the first Test at Edgbaston, and 259 in an innings victory in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s. His 277 remained the highest individual Test innings scored by a South African until November 2010, surpassing the previous record of 275 held jointly by Daryll Cullinan and Gary Kirsten; his 259 remains the highest score made at Lord&#x27;s by a foreign player, breaking the record of 254 set by Sir Donald Bradman in 1930. These performances prompted Alec Stewart to call him &quot;the most impressive 22-year-old I have seen in cricket&quot;; the Edgbaston match prompted Nasser Hussain to retire as captain of England, to be succeeded by Michael Vaughan. This outstanding run of form could have continued but for an unusual dismissal: in the third Test at Trent Bridge Smith, on 35, played back to Andrew Flintoff and trod on his stumps to be dismissed hit wicket. Smith did not pass 20 again in the series as a galvanized England led by Vaughan won the match and fought back to draw the series 2–2, but Smith nonetheless finished the series with an aggregate of 714 runs at an average of 79.33, and was named player of the series (jointly with Flintoff).

During the year 2004 South Africa had a significantly less successful run in ODI cricket than they would have expected, with a 5–1 series loss to New Zealand and a 5–0 series loss to Sri Lanka. They had beaten the West Indies 3–1 earlier in the year, but South African cricket was described as being in a state of &#x27;freefall&#x27;. In Test matches also South Africa suffered a poor run with series losses to England, India, and Sri Lanka. They did nevertheless win a home Test series against the West Indies (with Smith and Gibbs sharing their third 300-run opening partnership).

Although initially regarded as an inexperienced captain, his growth in the role was evidenced when he was selected to captain the ICC World XI in the ICC Super Series Test Match between the ICC World XI and Australia in October 2005.

South Africa won a Test series in the West Indies in 2005, with Smith scoring centuries in three consecutive Tests: 148 at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, 104 at the Kensington Oval and 126 at Antigua. However, their tour of Australia and Australia&#x27;s subsequent return tour in the 2005–06 season were disappointments for Smith, as they succumbed to a 2–0 defeat in Australia, and a 3–0 whitewash at home. Yet, for his performances in 2005, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC. Pride was restored when Smith led his team to victory in South Africa&#x27;s win over Australia in a One Day International at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, on 12 March 2006. Australia set South Africa a world record 434–4 from 50 overs, which was successfully chased by South Africa who reached 438–9 with a ball to spare. Smith scored 90 runs off 55 balls in the chase, and shared in a second-wicket partnership of 187 runs with Herschelle Gibbs. The result gave South Africa in a 3–2 series victory over the Australians.

In the first ODI against Pakistan on 4 February 2007, Smith hit an over bowled by Naved-ul-Hasan for 27 runs, and became the first player in ODI history to hit six fours off an over; Smith scored 72 from 47 balls as South Africa totalled 392–6, the highest ODI total ever made against a Test nation (excluding Zimbabwe) apart from the two innings of the aforementioned Wanderers match between Australia and South Africa. As captain he led the South African cricket team through 20 consecutive undefeated matches in One Day Internationals in 2005. In early 2007 Smith&#x27;s South Africans replaced Australia on top of the official ICC rankings for ODI cricket but returned to second place after mixed results in the 2007 ICC World Cup thus far after losing to Australia by eight wickets. In the 2007 World Cup, he started the tournament with four successive 50s, a feat never before achieved by a captain.

During the second Test against Bangladesh at Chittagong in begun on 29 February 2008 Smith (who scored 232) and Neil McKenzie (226) put on a world record 415 for the first wicket. The partnership beat the previous first-wicket record of 413 which had been set in 1956 by Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy. They had finished day one with 405 runs on the board which was the most ever put on by a pair in a single day of Test cricket without losing a wicket. The partnership was Smith&#x27;s fourth opening partnership of over 300 runs, and his sixth of over 200 runs, both Test records.

In scoring 108 in the second innings of the first Test against England at Lord&#x27;s in 2008, Smith participated in a seventh double-century opening partnership, again in conjunction with McKenzie, as South Africa fought to draw a Test which appeared lost. He also scored a second-innings 154 not out in the third Test at Edgbaston, to lead South Africa to a challenging target of 281, and with it South Africa&#x27;s first series victory in England since 1965. The result provided Smith with personal vengeance against Michael Vaughan for denying South Africa a series victory in England in 2003 and defeating South Africa at home in 2004–5; Vaughan resigned as captain of England after the Edgbaston match, in an echo of Nasser Hussain&#x27;s resignation at the instigation of Smith&#x27;s batting five years earlier.

South Africa would later on go to Australia for a Test and one-day series that was billed as the &#x27;heavyweight&#x27; series. It was the world champions Australia taking on the number two side South Africa with the series winner becoming world champions. In the first test match at Perth, South Africa chased down 414 runs with 6 wickets in hand. This was the second-largest fourth innings total that was chased down in history and the highest on Australian soil. Graeme Smith broke his Australian hoodoo by leading from the front and scoring 108, his first century against Australia. He would also share a partnership with Hashim Amla.

In December 2008 he captained the first South African side that won a test series against Australia on their soil, in the course inflicting the first home defeat on the opponents in 16 years. On 7 January 2009, in the third test of the series, Smith received a standing ovation from the crowd when he batted in the second innings despite a broken hand in an attempt to save the Third Test. He fell with ten balls remaining and Australia won the Test.

For his performances in 2008, he was named as captain of the World Test XI by ICC and ESPNcricinfo.

After South Africa lost to New Zealand in the quarter-finals of the 2011 World Cup, Smith resigned as ODI and Twenty20 captain. He was replaced by AB de Villiers.
Smith had to recover from an ankle injury to face England in three test series in 2012. By beating England in the first and third tests and drawing the second – he led South Africa to a series victory. This put South Africa back on top of the ICC Test rankings. And with England Test cricket captain Andrew Strauss retiring from all forms of cricket right after this defeat, Graeme Smith achieved a rare feat of toppling three English captains in three tours to England.

For his performances in 2012, he was named in Test XI of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

In October 2019, he was elected as an honorary life member of the Marylebone Cricket Club in recognition of his outstanding achievement in Cricket.

===Captaincy===

He is the most successful test captain in test history (53 test wins) and also the only captain to have registered 50+ test wins, having overtaken Ricky Ponting&#x27;s 48 Test victories. He&#x27;s the only player to captain a team in 100 Tests.

==Coaching career==
He was appointed as director of cricket for South Africa national cricket team in mid December 2019 initially on a temporary three-month stint and after the three-month stint in an interim capacity as director of cricket, he was also slated for commentary role for the 2020 Indian Premier League. However, in April 2020, following the postponement of the IPL owing to COVID-19 concerns, his contract as director of CSA was extended to further two years up until March 2022. His three-year tenure as director of South African team ended on 31 March 2022 with immediate effect. Smith decided not to reapply for the post following the outcome of SJN Hearings.

==Controversies==
During a Test series against South Africa in 2005, Trinidadian Dwayne Bravo scored his maiden century – 107 – before getting out to Mark Boucher in the fourth Test in Antigua, but that was overshadowed when he accused Smith of directing a racist comment at him. At the subsequent hearing no evidence could be found and charges were dropped against Smith, who immediately demanded an apology from Bravo. Bravo, backed by the West Indies Cricket Board, refused to do so and received a hail of criticism from an indignant South African press while finding support at home as a human rights campaigner.

=== SJN Hearings on racism allegations ===
In 2021, he was accused of racism allegations during his playing career and the matter was taken into consideration at the Cricket South Africa&#x27;s (CSA) Social Justice and Nation Building (SJN) transformation public hearings. He was among several employees of CSA to be implicated in tentative findings made by SJN ombudsman. The report claimed that he had engaged in racially biased and discriminatory behavior on three counts during his tenure as captain of South African test side and during his three-year run as CSA&#x27;s director of cricket.

As the report claims, he was accused of causing a roadblock to wicketkeeper batsman Thami Tsolekile when he was on the verge of taking over the keeping duties from Boucher as Boucher&#x27;s international career was cut short prematurely due to an eye injury. Smith paved way for AB de Villiers to become the designated wicketkeeper of the side ahead of Tsolekile despite the fact that de Villiers being only a specialist keeper for the test series against England in 2012. Moreover, Smith was also alleged to have been appointed as the director of cricket of Cricket South Africa in contrast to the CSA&#x27;s recruitment policy. It was revealed that the then CEO of CSA Thabang Moroe headhunted Smith to appointed him as director of cricket despite the interviewing process for the relevant job position was still taking place.

However, Smith was cleared of racism allegations by two independent arbitrators who indicated there was no evidence of racial bias and indicated that there was no evidence on whether Smith had engaged in racial discrimination. CSA has also been ordered to pay Smith&#x27;s costs for the arbitration process.

==Records==
* Smith holds the world record of captaining in most number test matches. He is also the only test captain to play in excess of 100 test matches. (109 – 108 as captain for South Africa, and 1 for ICC).
* Smith holds the world record of the highest number of wins in test matches as a captain with 53 wins.

<text>Colonel Kumar Sri Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji II, (10 September 1872 – 2 April 1933), often known as Ranji or K. S. Ranjitsinhji, was an Indian cricketer who later became ruler of his native Indian princely state of Nawanagar from 1907 to 1933. The main part of his cricket career was from 1893 to 1904 when, as one of the greatest batsmen of his time, he played for Cambridge University, Sussex, London County and, in 15 Test matches, for England.

Ranjitsinhji was an unorthodox batsman whose fast reactions and individual style were to revolutionise the game. Previously, batsmen had generally played forward and made shots to the off side; Ranjitsinhji took advantage of the improving quality of pitches in his era and played more on the back foot, both in defence and attack. He is particularly associated with one shot, the leg glance, which he popularised and may have invented.

He has been called the &quot;Father of Indian Cricket&quot;, as he was the earliest top-class Indian cricketer, but he has been criticised for his refusal to aid and encourage the development of cricket in India itself. The annual first-class championship of India, the Ranji Trophy, was named in his honour by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala who inaugurated the competition in 1935. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s nephew Duleepsinhji followed his path as a batsman playing first-class cricket for Cambridge, Sussex, and England.

==Early life==
===Birth===
Ranjitsinhji Jadeja was born on 10 September 1872 in Sadodar, a village in the state of Nawanagar in the western Indian province of Kathiawar in a Hindu Jadeja Rajput family.

He was the first son of a farmer, Jiwansinhji, and one of his wives. His name meant &quot;the lion who conquers in battle&quot;, although he frequently suffered ill health as a child. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s family were related to the ruling family of the state of Nawanagar through his grandfather, and head of his family, Jhalamsinhji. The latter was a cousin of Vibhaji, the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar; Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s biographers later claimed that Jhalamsinhji had shown bravery fighting for Vibhaji in a successful battle, but Simon Wilde suggests that this may be an invention encouraged by Ranjitsinhji. For the remainder of his life, Ranjitsinhji was sensitive about his family and deliberately presented a positive image of his parents.

===Heir to the throne===
In 1856, Vibhaji&#x27;s son, Kalubha, was born, becoming heir to Vibhaji&#x27;s throne. However, as Kalubha grew, he established a reputation for violence and terror. Among his actions were an attempt to poison his father and a multiple rape. Consequently, Vibhaji disinherited his son in 1877 and, having no other suitable heir, followed custom by adopting an heir from another branch of his family, that of Jhalamsinhji. The first selected heir died within six months of being adopted, either through fever or poisoning on the orders of Kalubha&#x27;s mother. The second choice, in October 1878, was Ranjitsinhji. Vibhaji took him to Rajkot to secure the approval of the ruling British and the young boy lived there for the next 18 months before joining the Rajkumar College, supported through this time by an allowance from Vibhaji. Being discouraged by the ambition of Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s family and the conduct of Jiwansinhji, Vibhaji never completed the adoption of Ranjitsinhji and continued trying to produce his own heir. The prospect of Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s accession seemed to vanish in August 1882 when one of the women of Vibhaji&#x27;s court gave birth to a son, Jaswantsinhji.

Ranjitisinhji&#x27;s later version of events, reported by his biographer Roland Wild, was that his adoption had been carried out in secret, for fear of Vibhaji&#x27;s wives. According to Wild, &quot;The boy&#x27;s father and grandfather watched the ceremony which was officially recorded by the India Office, the Government of India, and the Bombay Government.&quot; However, there is no record of any such event, which Simon Wilde says, &quot;suggests, fairly conclusively, it never happened.&quot; Roland Wild and Charles Kincaid, who wrote a book in 1931 which also put forward Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s perspective, also said that Jaswantsinhji was not a legitimate heir, either through not being Vibhaji&#x27;s son or through his mother not being legally married to Vibhaji. However, the claims are either demonstrably wrong or not corroborated by the records. The British authorities, unhappy to discover Ranjitsinhji was never adopted and impressed by his potential at the college, initially tried to persuade Vibhaji to retain Ranjitsinhji as his heir but the Jam Sahib insisted Jaswantsinhji should succeed him. In October 1884, the Government of India recognised Jaswantsinhji as Vibhaji&#x27;s heir, but the Viceroy, Lord Ripon, believed that Ranjitsinhji should be compensated for losing his position.

===Education===
Even though Ranjitsinhji was no longer heir, Vibhaji increased his financial allowance but passed the responsibility for his education to the Bombay Presidency. With his fees coming from the allowance, Ranjitsinhji continued his education at the Rajkumar College. Although his material position remained unchanged, comments made at the time by the principal of the college, Chester Macnaghten, suggest that Ranjitsinhji was bitterly disappointed by his disinheritance. The college was organised and run like an English public school, and Ranjitsinhji began to excel.

Ranjitsinhji was introduced to cricket aged 10 or 11, and first represented the school in 1883. He was appointed captain in 1884 and maintained this position until 1888. While he may have scored centuries for the school, the cricket was low standard, and very different from that played in England. Ranjitsinhji did not take it particularly seriously and preferred tennis at the time. No one was certain what would become of him once he left the college, but his academic prowess presented the solution of moving to England to study at Cambridge University.

==Cambridge University==
===Academic progress===
In March 1888, Macnaghten took Ranjitsinhji to London, with two other students who exhibited potential. One of the events to which Macnaghten took Ranjitsinhji was a cricket match between Surrey County Cricket Club and the touring Australian team. Ranjitsinhji was enthralled by the standard of cricket, and Charles Turner, an Australian known more as a bowler, scored a century in front of a large crowd; Ranjitsinhji later said he did not see a better innings for ten years. Macnaghten returned to India that September but arranged for Ranjitsinhji and one of the other students, Ramsinhji, to live in Cambridge. Their second choice of lodgings proved successful, living with the family of Reverend Louis Borrisow, at the time the chaplain of Trinity College, Cambridge, who tutored them for the next year. Ranjitsinhji lived with the Borrisows until 1892 and remained close to them throughout his life. According to Roland Wild, Borrisow believed Ranjitsinhji was &quot;lazy and irresponsible&quot; and obsessed with leisure activities including cricket, tennis, billiards and photography. Wild also says that he might have struggled to acclimatise to English life and did not settle to academic study. Possibly as a consequence, Ranjitsinhji failed the preliminary entrance exam to Trinity College in 1889, but he and Ramsinhji were allowed to enter the college as &quot;youths of position&quot;. Nevertheless, Ranjitsinhji concentrated more on sport than study while at Cambridge, being content to work no more than necessary and he never graduated. A Freemason, he was also a member of Isaac Newton University Lodge.

During the summer of 1890, Ranjitsinhji and Ramsinhji took a holiday in Bournemouth. For the trip, Ranjitsinhji adopted the name &quot;K. S. [Kumar Sri] Ranjitsinhji&quot;. While in Bournemouth, he took more interest in cricket, achieving success in local matches which suggested he possessed talent, but little refinement of technique. According to Wild, by the time he returned to Trinity in September 1890, he was beginning to realise the benefit of others believing him to be a person of importance, something that was to lead to him adopting the title &quot;Prince Ranjitsinhji&quot;, although he had no right to call himself a &quot;Prince&quot;. Significantly, the trip planted the seed in his mind that he might find success as a cricketer.

In June 1892, Ranjitsinhji left the Borrisow home and, with monetary assistance from relations, moved into his own rooms in the city of Cambridge. He lived in luxury and frequently entertained guests lavishly. According to writer Alan Ross, Ranjitsinhji may have been lonely in his first years at Cambridge and probably encountered racism and prejudice. Ross believes that his generosity may have partly arisen from trying to overcome these barriers. However, Ranjitsinhji increasingly lived beyond his means to the point where he experienced financial difficulty. He intended to pass the examinations to be called to the Bar and wrote to ask Vibhaji to provide more money to cover the costs; Vibhaji sent the money on the condition Ranjitsinhji returned to India once he passed the examination. Ranjitsinhji intended to keep to this arrangement, although he did not plan a career as a barrister, but his debts were larger than he had thought and not only could he not afford the cost of the Bar examination, he was forced to leave Cambridge University, without graduating, in spring 1894.

===Beginnings as a cricketer===
At first, Ranjitsinhji had hoped to be awarded a Blue at tennis, but, possibly inspired by his visit to see the Australians play in 1888, he decided to concentrate on cricket. In 1889 and 1890, he played local cricket of a low standard, but following his stay in Bournemouth, he set out to improve his cricket. In June 1891 he joined the recently re-formed Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club and was successful enough in trial matches to represent the county in several games that September. His highest score was just 23 not out, but he was selected for a South of England team to play a local side—which had 19 players to make the match more competitive—and his score of 34 was the highest in the game. However, Ranjitsinhji had neither the strength nor the range of batting strokes to succeed at this stage.

Around this time, Ranjitsinhji began to work with Daniel Hayward, a first-class cricketer and the father of future England batsman Thomas Hayward, on his batting technique. His main fault was a tendency to back away from the ball when facing a fast bowler, making it more likely he would be dismissed. Possibly prompted by the suggestion of a professional cricketer who was bowling at him in the nets at Cambridge, he and Hayward began to practise with Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s right leg tied to the ground. This affected his future batting technique and contributed to his adoption of the leg glance, a shot with which he afterwards became associated. While practising, he continued to move his left leg, which was not tied, away from the ball; in this case, it moved to his right, towards point. He found he could then flick the ball behind his legs, a highly unorthodox shot and likely, for most players, to result in their dismissal. Although other players had probably played this shot before, Ranjitsinhji was able to play it with unprecedented effectiveness. Ranjitsinhji probably developed his leg glance with Hayward around spring 1892, for during the remainder of that year, he scored around 2,000 runs in all cricket, far more than he had previously managed, making at least nine centuries, a feat he had never previously achieved in England.

Ranjitsinhji began to establish a reputation for unorthodox cricket, and attracted some interest to his play, but important cricketers did not take him seriously as he played contrary to the accepted way for an amateur or university batsman, established by the conventions in English public schools. In one match, he was observed by the captain of the Cambridge University cricket team and future England captain Stanley Jackson, who found his batting and probably his appearance unusual but was not impressed.

===University cricket===
At least one Cambridge University cricketer believed that Ranjitsinhji should have played for the team in 1892; he played in two trial games with moderate success, but Jackson believed he was not good enough to play first-class cricket. Jackson was probably also the reason Ranjitisinhji did not play cricket for Trinity College until 1892, despite his success for other teams. Jackson himself wrote in 1933 that, at the time, he lacked a &quot;sympathetic interest for Indians&quot;, and Simon Wilde has suggested that prejudice lay behind Jackson&#x27;s attitude. Jackson also said in 1893 that underestimating Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s ability was a big mistake.

However, Ranjitsinhji made his debut for Trinity in 1892 after injury ruled out another player and his subsequent form, including a century, kept him in the college team, achieving a batting average of 44, only Jackson averaging more. However, the other players ignored Ranjitsinhji in these matches. That June, watched by Ranjitsinhji, Cambridge were defeated by Oxford in the University Match; Malcolm Jardine, an Oxford batsman, hit 140 runs, many with a version of the leg glance; Jackson would not alter his tactics and Jardine was able to score easy runs.

That winter, Jackson had taken part in a cricket tour of India, where he was impressed by the standard of cricket. When he observed, at the start of the 1893 cricket season, the dedication with which Ranjitsinhji was practising in the nets to increase his concentration against the highly regarded professional bowlers Tom Richardson and Bill Lockwood, Jackson asked Lockwood for his opinion. Lockwood noted how much Ranjitsinhji had improved through practice and told Jackson he believed Ranjitsinhji was better than several players in the university team. Then, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s early form in 1893, scoring heavily for Trinity and performing reasonably well in a trial match, convinced Jackson. He made his first-class debut for Cambridge on 8 May 1893 against a team selected by Charles Thornton; he batted at number nine in the batting order and scored 18. He maintained his place in the side over the next weeks, making substantial scores in several innings against bowlers with a good reputation. He grew in confidence as the season progressed; critics commented on several occasions on the effectiveness of his cut shot and his fielding was regarded as exceptionally good. His highest and most notable score came during a defeat by the Australian touring team when he made 58 runs in 105 minutes, followed by a two-hour 37 not out in difficult batting conditions during the second innings. His batting made a great impression on spectators, who gave him an ovation at the end of the game. The game appears to be the first occasion in first-class cricket where Ranjitsinhji used the leg glance. Ranjitsinhji was awarded his Blue after the match, and following some more successful but brief innings, he played in the university match. He was given a good reception by the crowd but scored only 9 and 0 in the game, which his team won. With the Cambridge season over, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s batting average of 29.90 placed him third in the side&#x27;s averages, with five scores over 40. He took nineteen catches, mainly at slip. Such was his impact that Ranjitsinhji was selected in representative games, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval and for a team combining past and present players for both Oxford and Cambridge Universities against the Australians, scoring a total of 50 runs in three innings.

Following his success at cricket, Ranjitsinhji was more widely accepted within Trinity. His new-found popularity led to the creation by his friends of a nickname; finding his name difficult, they initially dubbed him &quot;Smith&quot;, then shortened his full name to &quot;Ranji&quot;, which remained with him for the rest of his life. At this time, Ranjitsinhji may have furthered rumours of his royal background or great wealth, and he was further encouraged to spend money to entertain others and reinforce the impression of his status. Several English first-class counties made enquiries over his availability to play for them, and he was invited to make a speech at a Cambridge club dinner, attended by prominent figures in Cambridge; his general remarks about the good treatment of Indians in England were reported in the press as being in support of Indian federation and suggested the public were eager to hear his words. However, Ranjitsinhji was unable to continue his cricket with Cambridge as he had to leave before the start of the 1894 season.

==First spell with Sussex==
===County debut===
Following his failure to take the Bar examinations and return to India, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s allowance was stopped by Vibhaji. Ranjitsinhji, owing money to many creditors in Cambridge who included personal friends, appealed to the British in India and Vibhaji was persuaded to advance a loan to cover Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s expenses before his expected return to India. Simon Wilde believes this incident encouraged a belief in Ranjitsinhji that someone else would always cover his debts. Even so, he was not called to the Bar in 1894, or at any point afterwards. Nor did he make any attempt to return to India, despite his assurances to Vibhaji. Instead, his developing friendship with Billy Murdoch and C. B. Fry led to Ranjitsinhji becoming interested in playing cricket for Sussex. Murdoch, the Sussex captain, wished to increase his team&#x27;s playing strength. It is likely that, although he would play as an amateur, the club offered Ranjitsinhji a financial inducement, as was common for leading amateurs; given his monetary difficulties and unwillingness to return home, he was unlikely to refuse the offer. However, these arrangements came too late for Ranjitsinhji to play for the county in 1894, and his cricket that year was limited to matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), festival games and benefit matches. Consequently, he could neither find any batting form nor build on his achievements of the previous year. Although struggling to bat against off spin in one game, he scored 94 while sharing a partnership of 200 runs with W. G. Grace in another. In eight first-class games, he scored 387 runs at an average of 32.25.

Despite debts which continued to mount, Ranjitsinhji prepared thoroughly before the 1895 season, practising in the nets at Cambridge with Tom Hayward and scoring heavily in club matches. Although Sussex were not a strong team, Ranjitsinhji was not certain of a place in the side. His debut came in a match against the MCC; after scoring 77 not out in his first innings and then taking six wickets, he scored his maiden first-class century in the second. In 155 minutes, he scored 150 runs and took his team close to an improbable victory; he became increasingly attacking throughout the innings and dominated the scoring. At the end, although his team lost, he was given an ovation by the crowd who were impressed by his strokeplay. Yet it is unlikely that he met the qualification rules in force at the time for appearing in the County Championship; this was hinted at by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, but no protests were made.

For the rest of the season, Ranjitsinhji made a vivid impression wherever he played. Crowds were substantially increased at matches in which he appeared and he established a reputation for brilliant batting and shots on the leg side. Although, after his debut, he made a slow start in poor weather, he batted himself into good form in several matches on Brighton&#x27;s good batting pitch. He scored centuries against Middlesex and Nottinghamshire in very difficult batting conditions, and his batting against the latter was regarded by critics as among the best of the season. He was less effective at the end of the season, possibly suffering from mental and physical fatigue, but his overall record of 1,775 runs at an average of 49.31 placed him fourth in the national averages. Ranjitsinhji was particularly popular at Brighton; Simon Wilde writes: &quot;The crowds would stroll the outfield during intervals in play at a loss to explain what he did: the most disdainful flick of the wrists, and he could exasperate some of England&#x27;s finest bowlers; the most rapid sweep of the arms, and the ball was charmed to any part of the field he chose, as though he had in his hands not a bat but a wizard&#x27;s wand.&quot;

Shortly before the season began, Vibhaji died; his 12-year-old son Jaswantsinhji officially succeeded to the throne on 10 May, while Ranjitsinhji was playing for Sussex against the MCC, taking the new name Jassaji. The British appointed an Administrator to rule until he reached an appropriate age to assume the responsibility of a ruler. As Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s fame increased throughout 1895, journalists pressed for more information on his background. Some stories circulated that his father was the ruler of an Indian state and that he had been deprived of his rightful position as ruler of Nawanagar; despite his protestations that this was not correct, it is likely that Ranjitsinhji was the source of these stories. It is possible he began planning to contest the position, prompted by the enquiries of the press and his claim to be a prince.

===Test debut and controversy===
Ranjitsinhji played several large innings at the start of the 1896 season, scoring faster and impressing critics with more daring shots. Before June, he had hit hundreds against the highly regarded Yorkshire bowlers and in match-saving performances against Gloucestershire and Somerset and became the second batsman, and first amateur, to reach 1,000 runs in the season. Innings of 79 and 42 against the touring Australian team underlined his status as one of the few batsmen to cope with the visitors&#x27; bowling spearhead, the highly regarded Ernie Jones; he concentrated on the leg-glance and cut shot, which the Australians were unable to counter through altered tactics.

These performances brought him into contention for a place in the England team for the first Test match, but although his form merited selection, he was not chosen by the MCC committee which chose the team. Lord Harris was primarily responsible for the decision, possibly under influence from the British Government; Simon Wilde believed they may have feared establishing a precedent that made races interchangeable or wished to curtail the involvement of Indians in British political life. Bateman&#x27;s assessment is less sympathetic to Harris: &quot;the high-minded imperialist Lord Harris, who had just returned from a spell of colonial duty in India, opposed his qualification for England on the grounds of race&quot;.

Even so, the decision to omit Ranjitsinhji took a long time, proved unpopular when it was made and led to discussion in the press. &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent commented during the first Test: &quot;There was some feeling about K. S. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s absence, but although the Indian Prince has learnt all his cricket in England he could scarcely, if the title of the match were to be adhered to, have been included in the English eleven&quot;, but &quot;The Field&quot; supported his inclusion.

Meanwhile, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s good form continued. The team for the second Test was chosen by a different committee, and Ranjitsinhji was included, probably for financial reasons to attract more spectators. The batsman insisted that he would only play if the Australian team had no objections, but the Australian captain was pleased that the Indian would be included. Discussion continued in the press over how appropriate it was that he should play for England, but from that point, Ranjitsinhji was considered eligible to play for England. The controversy may have upset Ranjitsinhji as his form wavered while the first Test was played and on his next appearance at Lord&#x27;s, before the MCC committee, he made a pointed attack on the bowling in a rapid innings of 47.

Ranjitsinhji made his Test debut on 16 July 1896. After a cautious 62 in his first innings, he batted again when England followed on, 181 runs behind. After the second day, he had scored 42 and on the final morning, he scored 113 runs before the lunch interval, surviving a fast, hostile spell from Jones and playing many shots on the leg side to reach the first century scored that season against the tourists. His final score was 154 not out, and the next highest score for England on the last day was 19. He was given an enthusiastic reception by the crowd and the report in &quot;Wisden&quot; stated: &quot;[The] famous young Indian fairly rose to the occasion, playing an innings that could, without exaggeration, be fairly described as marvellous. He punished the Australian bowlers in a style that, up to that period of the season, no other English batsman had approached. He repeatedly brought off his wonderful strokes on the leg side, and for a while had the Australian bowlers quite at his mercy&quot;.

Although Australia won the match, the players were astonished by the way Ranjitsinhji batted. Not everyone was pleased at his success. Home Gordon, a journalist, praised Ranjitsinhji in a conversation with an MCC member; the man angrily threatened to have Gordon expelled from the MCC for &quot;having the disgusting degeneracy to praise a dirty black.&quot; Gordon also heard other MCC members complaining about &quot;a nigger showing us how to play the game of cricket&quot;.

Over the next weeks, Ranjitsinhji lost form, and after failing twice in the third Test, missed the last day of the match suffering from asthma, but he scored heavily after this. After sharing a big partnership with Fry for Sussex against the Australian team, he scored 40 and 165, with little support from other batsmen, to save the match against Lancashire, the runners up in the County Championship. In the following match against Yorkshire, on 22 August 1896, the County Champions that season, he scored two centuries on the last day of the game as Sussex saved the match after following on; prior to this, only four men had scored two centuries in the same first-class game, and as of 2011, no one else has scored two on the same day. By the end of the season, he had scored 2,780 runs, beating the record aggregate for a season held by W. G. Grace, and hit 10 centuries, equalling another record of Grace. His average of 57.92 was the highest of the season. Even so, Sussex finished bottom of the County Championship as Ranjitsinhji had little batting support and the team&#x27;s bowling was ineffective.

===Succession dispute===

Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s fame increased after 1896, and among the praise for his cricket were hints in the press that he intended to pursue a political career, following other Indians in England. Instead he began to turn his attention to the Nawanagar succession, beginning to make enquiries in India as to his position. Meanwhile, he began to cultivate potentially beneficial connections; at Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee celebrations, he established a friendship with Pratap Singh, the regent of Jodhpur, whom he later falsely described as his uncle.

Ranjitsinhji decided to return to India to further his case, prompted by the decision of Vibhaji&#x27;s grandson Lakhuba to dispute the succession. Meanwhile, the financial expectations of behaving as a prince pushed Ranjitsinhji even further into debt, and his allowance had been stopped after he had been given an advance on it to cover earlier money owed. He wrote to Willoughby Kennedy, the English Administrator of Nawanagar, asking for money but none was forthcoming. His financial situation eased when a serious illness confined him to the house of an acquaintance. He took the opportunity to begin work on a cricket book which a publisher had invited him to write; Ranjitsinhji contributed seven chapters and other writers contributed the rest, then he and Fry revised the book together while travelling through Europe in the spring of 1897. The book was released in August 1897 under the title &quot;The Jubilee Book of Cricket&quot;, and was a success, both commercially and with the critics: the review by Francis Thompson was entitled, &quot;A Prince of India on the Prince of Games&quot;. Nevertheless, he was approaching bankruptcy by the end of 1897 and there are indications, such as an increased temper, that he felt the pressure.

Having been named one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year for his performances in 1896, Ranjitsinhji began the 1897 season strongly, scoring 260 for Sussex against the MCC then, playing for MCC against Lancashire hit 157. A succession of low scores on a series of difficult pitches ended when he scored three centuries in July, but in the remainder of the season he only once passed fifty. He scored 1,940 runs at 45.12, figures which matched other leading batsmen, but his relative loss of form, noted by critics, was owed partly to ill health. He suffered from asthma throughout the season, and some commentators blamed the stress of producing his book. However, he may also have been distracted by his interest in the Nawanagar succession.

===Tour of Australia===
Ranjitsinhji was chosen to tour Australia with Andrew Stoddart&#x27;s team during the winter of 1897–98. The team was defeated 4–1 by Australia, who were superior tactically and had the better players in general.

Ranjitsinhji was one of the few successes on the tour and scored 1,157 runs in first-class matches at an average of 60.89. He quickly acclimatised to the unfamiliar conditions and scored 189 in the first game, followed by scores of 64 and 112 in the following two matches. However, shortly before the Test series was due to begin, Ranjitsinhji fell ill with quinsy and would have been unfit for the first Test but for heavy rain which postponed the start for three days. When the match began, Ranjitsinhji batted towards the end of the first day and, still weak from his illness, played carefully; he was exhausted after scoring 39 not out. The next morning, as England lost wickets, he attacked the bowlers and took his score to 175, scoring mainly from cuts and leg glances. He batted for 215 minutes and reached the highest score for England in Test matches; the record lasted for six years. England won the match by nine wickets, but this was their only success of the series.

Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s health remained poor, but he played in the rest of the series. He scored a half-century in one innings of each of the next three Tests, each time facing a large Australian total. He and Archie MacLaren were the only two tourists to come to terms with the conditions and bowling; despite being labelled a poor starter by the press, Ranjitsinhji batted cautiously in each match, possibly attempting to emulate the Australian approach of accumulating runs carefully. The only Test in which Ranjitsinhji failed to reach fifty was the fifth, when England were defeated for the fourth time in succession. Even so, he scored 457 runs at an average of 50.77 in the series.

Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s tour was controversial in one aspect only: a series of articles he wrote for an Australian magazine. Although highly self-critical in the articles, he criticised, among other things, the behaviour of the crowds, the refusal of Australian critics to accept that England had to bat in poor conditions in the second Test, and some opposing players. He also supported the decision of an umpire to no-ball some deliveries from Ernie Jones, in a match against Stoddart&#x27;s team, for illegally throwing the ball rather than bowling it. He was generally very popular in Australia with crowds, the general public and influential figures in society, although following these comments, the crowds at some matches barracked him while he was batting.

At the end of the tour, he wrote an open letter to mend his relations with the Australian public, but in &quot;With Stoddart&#x27;s team in Australia&quot;, he wrote of the &quot;regrettable&quot; incident of &quot;merciless&quot;, &quot;uncomplimentary and insulting&quot; barracking.

==Cricketing peak and decline==
===Return to India===
In April 1898, Stoddart&#x27;s cricket team returned to England via Colombo. On arrival there, Ranjitsinhji left the team to return to India with the intention of pursuing his claim to the throne of Nawanagar. He spent the remainder of the year in India and did not return to England until March 1899.

Initially, he tried to establish support for his claim, including his argument that Jassaji was illegitimate, among the Indian princes. Later, he met Pratap Singh, who had arranged for Ranjitsinhji to receive an honorary state appointment with an associated income. Pratap Singh also introduced him to Rajinder Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala, a very wealthy individual. Rajinder was very pro-British and an enthusiastic cricketer and soon became friends with Ranjitsinhji; he subsequently provided Ranjitsinhji with another source of income.

Ranjitsinhji travelled extensively throughout India, trying to build support among the princes and local officials, and received an enthusiastic reception from the public wherever he went. He also spent time with his mother and family in Sarador. He played plenty of cricket during his visit, with mixed success. Although he scored 257 in one game, in another he failed to score in either innings, the only time this happened to him in any form of cricket.

The British administration in India were concerned by Ranjitsinhji; some individuals suspected that he intended to cause trouble in Nawanagar and wished to keep him out of the region. Others supported him, believing he had been treated unfairly. Kennedy, the Administrator of Nawanagar, successfully lobbied the Government of Bombay and the India Office in London to have Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s allowance doubled. But concerns among senior figures in the Government of Bombay about whether this was appropriate and over any potential agitation in Nawanagar by Ranjitsinhji meant that Kennedy&#x27;s appeal to have the allowance further increased was unsuccessful. However, the increase was dependent upon him no longer pursuing his claim to the throne and not becoming involved in any plots in Nawanagar, and Ranjitsinhji was reluctant to have any conditions imposed on him. Then on 28 September, Ranjitsinhji wrote to the Secretary of State for India, Lord George Hamilton, through the Government of Bombay, stating his claim. He argued that he had been adopted as heir before being set aside without an enquiry, and that Jassaji was illegitimate. The Government of Bombay rejected the appeal but Ranjitsinhji was able to use his contact with Rajinder Singh to meet the Viceroy, Lord Elgin. Consequently, the Government of India began to investigate and under Elgin&#x27;s successor, Lord Curzon, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s application was sent to Hamilton in London. Eventually, after Ranjitsinhji had returned to England, Hamilton also rejected the claim, but Simon Wilde believes the support he received from the princes and British officials, and the failure of anyone to point out that his adoption by Vibhaji was never carried out, must have encouraged Ranjitsinhji that his claim was viable. Having done all he could in India for the moment, he returned to England in March 1899.

===Record breaker===

Returning to England at the beginning of the 1899 cricket season, Ranjitsinhji immediately resumed playing cricket. However, his approach to batting had changed during his absence, and he showed greater determination to succeed. His health seemed improved and financial assistance from his supporters in India gave him respite from monetary worries. Having gained weight, he was more noticeably muscular and could drive more effectively than previously. After an uncertain start on a series of difficult pitches for batting, he informed the selectors he would not play in the first Test against the Australians, who were touring England once again. He was selected anyway and after scoring 42 in the first innings, he hit 93 not out in the second which ensured England drew the match after losing early wickets on the last day. His tactics were unorthodox as he took risks to ensure that he faced most of the bowling, even though he was batting with recognised batsmen. However, as the innings progressed, he rediscovered his batting touch. During June, he scored 1,000 runs: he scored four centuries, including a score of 197 which saved the game against Surrey, the eventual County Champions. He scored runs against the strong bowling of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and in August embarked on a sequence of 12 innings in which his lowest scores were 42 and 48 which enabled him to score 1,000 runs in August; no one had previously scored 1,000 runs in two separate months of the same season. In total, he scored 3,159 runs at an average of 63.18, becoming the first batsman to pass 3,000 first-class runs in a season, and made eight centuries. He was less successful against the Australians after the first Test, possibly through over-anxiety to replicate his form for Sussex. He was dismissed for low scores in the second and third games, but was slightly more successful with 21 and 49 not out in the fourth and he hit 54 in the final match. In a low-scoring series, Ranjitsinhji scored 278 runs at 46.33, the second highest average for England.

In June 1899, Ranjitsinhji was appointed Sussex captain after Murdoch retired, ahead of other amateur cricketers. George Brann captained the county&#x27;s first match after Murdoch stood down but he may have found the position to be too difficult, and Ranjitsinhji led the team for the remainder of the season. The press regarded his first season as a success as a late sequence of matches without defeat took Sussex to fifth in the County Championship, the highest position achieved by the team to that point. As captain, Ranjitsinhji took great care over details such as weather conditions, but some of his innovations, such as the frequent changing of the person bowling or implementing fielding practice, were unpopular with the players. He took the opportunity of leading the side to increase the amount of bowling he did, taking 31 wickets in the season. But the team&#x27;s lack of effective bowlers was a problem before Ranjitsinhji took over.

Ranjitsinhji continued to score heavily throughout the 1900 season. After a slow start in cold weather, in the space of nine days, he hit scores of 97, 127, 222 and 215 not out, followed by 192 a week later. After a brief sequence of low scores, he scored 1,000 runs in July and maintained his form until the end of the season; in his final 19 innings, he failed to reach 40 only three times. He was successful in a variety of conditions and match situations, and after some criticism of his ability to play on difficult pitches for batting, scored 89 against Somerset and 202 against Middlesex on rain affected pitches. Against Leicestershire, he achieved his highest score until then, making 275 in five hours. He hit a record-breaking fifth double-hundred of the season in his penultimate game; this was his eleventh century of the season, which was also briefly a record.

Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s final aggregate was 3,065 runs, the second highest total after that which he scored the previous year, at an average of 87.57; this placed him at the top of the national averages.

In response to Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s success, opposing captains began to adopt tactics to counter his leg-side shots, placing extra fielders on that side of the pitch to either block runs or to catch the ball. Consequently, Ranjitsinhji played the drive more frequently. &quot;Wisden&quot; reported: &quot;[He] became more and more a driving player ... Without abandoning his delightful leg-side strokes or beautifully timed cuts, he probably got the majority of his runs by drives—a notable change from his early years as a great cricketer&quot;.

His change of technique was effective statistically; he scored 2,468 runs at 70.51 and was third in the national averages.

However, he was less consistent than in the previous two seasons, never hitting more than three successive scores above 40. He suffered from ill-health early in the season and struggled in the first months. His later form was better and he made the highest score of his career, 285 against Somerset, but several leg break bowlers took his wicket and some of his innings were played in easier batting conditions or during less competitive circumstances.

===Failure in 1902===
According to Simon Wilde, part of the reason for Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s reduced output in 1901 was the death in November 1900 of Rajinder Singh; the subsequent reduction in his income would have presented Ranjitsinhji with financial difficulties. By November 1901, Ranjitsinhji faced bankruptcy and after an unavailing request to Nawangar for a resumption and increase of his allowance, only an appeal to the India Office prevented a court action against him. Through his solicitor, Ranjitsinhji claimed that his debt to one creditor only came through his acting on behalf of Pratap Singh and Sardar Singh, the Maharaja of Jodhpur. In December, Ranjitsinhji travelled to India to attempt to secure financial guarantees from the council acting for Rajinder Singh&#x27;s son and from Jodhpur but he was unsuccessful in his attempt to get the support of the Maharao of Kutch, who was sympathetic but unwilling to help; he nevertheless later received a request for a substantial sum of money which Ranjitsinhji claimed he had been promised. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s Indian trip caused him to miss the start of the 1902 season; no reason was given for his absence and the press and public did not know where he was.

Ranjitsinhji returned to England in mid-May and immediately resumed the captaincy of Sussex. However, a succession of low scores and uncertain performances suggested that he was neither mentally nor physically fit for cricket and Simon Wilde writes that his failure to secure support in India and the continued pressure of threatened bankruptcy placed him in a difficult situation. The Australian cricket team was touring England once more, and Ranjitsinhji, having played against the team for the MCC, was selected for the first Test. However, he seemed to be nervous and struggled to concentrate, running out his captain, Archie MacLaren before he was out himself for 13. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted: &quot;a misunderstanding, for which Ranjitsinhji considered himself somewhat unjustly blamed, led to MacLaren being run out, and then Ranjitsinhji himself quite upset by what had happened, was clean bowled&quot;.

Although he scored 135 for Sussex shortly afterwards, in the second Test he was out without scoring. Over the next few weeks, Ranjitsinhji made good starts to several innings but lost his wicket to uncharacteristic lapses and leg-break bowlers continued to trouble him.

He missed several matches, far more than he had missed in other seasons. However, in favourable batting circumstances he played two large innings in this period, hitting 230 against Essex and 234 against Surrey. An injury in the former game caused Ranjitsinhji to miss the third Test, lost by England, although his lack of confidence may have played a part in his decision. He returned for the fourth Test which England narrowly lost. However, he faced serious distractions from his parlous financial situation as one of his creditors presented him with a demand for payment shortly before the game. Ranjitsinhji claimed after the match, falsely, that Pratap Singh intended to pay the debt but needed approval from the India Office, but it is likely that Ranjitsinhji anticipated another petition in bankruptcy going before a court and that this affected his performance in the Test. Showing signs of nerves, and never looking comfortable while batting, Ranjitsinhji scored 2 runs in the first innings and 4 in the second. In the latter innings, when England had a relatively small target to chase for victory, he looked to have lost all confidence and could have been dismissed several times; the Australian players thought he played more poorly than they had ever seen. His lack of belief may also have contributed to the defeat, as Fred Tate notoriously dropped an important catch fielding, according to Simon Wilde, in a position which Ranjitsinhji was more likely to fill in normal circumstances.

Wilde writes: &quot;[Several members of the team] failed to play their part, notably Ranjitsinhji, whose abject performance was in marked contrast to his former days of splendour. The real reason for his poor performance has remained the knowledge of only a very few. At the time, a polite veil was drawn over his failure, but he was never to play for England again.&quot; In 15 Test matches, all against Australia, he scored 989 runs at an average of 44.96.

After the Test, Ranjitsinhji played only a few more games that season. After two batting failures for Sussex, he dropped out of the team, even though the side were in contention for the County Championship, eventually finishing second. Part of the reason may have been to pre-empt his omission from the England team for the final Test, a match he attended as a spectator, but he did not return to Sussex after the match. The press speculated he had walked out on the team; among the reasons suggested were disappointment with the performances of the side, dissatisfaction with the bowlers and efforts to recruit new players, and his falling out with the professional players. The local press criticised him for abandoning the team at a crucial phase of the season, and praised Brann, his replacement. Nevertheless, Ranjitsinhji preferred to play for MCC against the Australians, scoring 60 and 10. His three substantial innings gave him a batting record for the season which partially masked his difficulties: 1,106 runs at an average of 46.08, placing him second in the national averages.

Ranjitsinhji managed to raise enough money, probably through a loan, to head off the threat of bankruptcy. After spending time with Pratap Singh who was in London for the coronation of Edward VII, Ranjitsinhji went to Gilling East in Yorkshire, where the Reverend Borrisow now lived. He spent the winter there, adding to the speculation surrounding him. He became very close to Borrisow&#x27;s eldest daughter, Edith, and the pair may have become engaged around this time.

===Final regular seasons===

After alleviating some of his financial concerns through journalism and writing, Ranjitsinhji was able to return to cricket. Like the previous season, cricket in 1903 was badly affected by weather, resulting in many difficult batting pitches. Ranjitsinhji scored 1,924 runs at 56.58 to achieve second place in the national batting averages, but his consistency never matched that of his earlier years and he was frustrated by his form. He played more regularly for Sussex and missed just two matches but displayed a reduced commitment to the club and resigned the captaincy in December, Fry assuming the role. After a slow start, Ranjitsinhji found his form and made large scores against the leading counties until a pulled muscle affected his form in July. The difficult pitches forced him to play more defensively than usual and on a couple of occasions, crowds jeered him for slow scoring. The press also criticised his decision to prolong one Sussex innings until he had completed his own double century, adversely affecting his team&#x27;s chances of victory. In separate matches, Len Braund and Walter Mead, bowlers who had troubled him in previous years, both took his wicket before he had scored many runs. Ranjitsinhji was not considered for the MCC tour of Australia that winter, despite the unavailability of several leading amateurs; instead, he returned to India.

There, he made further inquiries regarding the succession to the Nawanagar throne and met British officials. Loans from an acquaintance from his school days, Mansur Khachar, as well as from the Nawab of Junagadh, allowed him to return to England for the following season.

In 1904, Ranjitsinhji led the batting averages for the fourth time, scoring 2,077 runs at 74.17.

In a ten-week sequence between June and August, he scored eight hundreds and five fifties, including innings against strong attacks and the leading counties. This included a highest score of 207 not out against Lancashire where Wisden reported that &quot;From the first ball to the last in that superb display he was at the highest pitch of excellence, and beyond that the art of batting cannot go.&quot; However, he missed eight Sussex games in total, suggesting his commitments had begun to lie elsewhere. Furthermore, many of his runs came in less important matches, away from the pressure of the County Championship. Not initially invited to play for the Gentlemen at Lord&#x27;s, he was a last minute replacement and subsequently captained the team.

His innings of 121, regarded by some critics as one of his best innings, helped the team to score an unlikely 412 runs in the final innings to defeat the Players. When the season ended with a series of festival games, although it was not known at the time, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s career as a regular cricketer was effectively over.

===Remainder of cricket career===

Four years after his previous appearances, and now known as H. H. the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, Ranjitsinhji returned to play cricket in England in 1908. Playing mainly in Sussex and London, he had put on weight and could no longer play in the same extravagant style he had previously used. Playing in many less competitive fixtures, he scored 1,138 runs at 45.52, finishing seventh in the averages. The effect on Sussex was not positive; &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that the irregular appearances of Ranjitsinhji and Fry, the team captain, distracted the rest of the team. In one match, Ranjitsinhji was responsible for the Sussex team failing to appear during a match, risking the forfeiture of the game, when he encouraged the team to remain at his residence in unsettled weather; conditions at the ground, and the opposition, were ready for play while the Sussex team remained 22 miles away.

In 1912, aged 39, Ranjitsinhji returned to England and played once more. Although announcing himself available to play for England in that season&#x27;s Test matches, he was not selected. Restricted for a period by a wrist injury, he nevertheless scored four centuries, including one against the touring Australian team. At times, his form briefly touched that of his best years but most of his cricket was played in the South of England. He scored 1,113 runs at 42.81, placing him eighth in the averages. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s last first-class cricket came in 1920; having lost an eye in a hunting accident, he played only three matches and found he could not focus on the ball properly. Possibly prompted by embarrassment at his performance, he later claimed his sole motivation for returning was to write a book about batting with one eye; such a book was never published.

In total, Ranjitsinhji scored 24,692 runs at an average of 56.37, the highest career average of a batsman based mainly in England until Geoffrey Boycott retired with 56.83 in 1986. He scored 72 hundreds.

===Failure to support Indian cricket===
Mihir Bose has commented that Ranjitsinhji &quot;has no place in Indian cricket history&quot;. This is because, though he sometimes returned to India while he was playing in England, he never played cricket there except on purely social occasions. Anthony de Mello wrote that he did absolutely nothing for Indian sport. Whenever the fledgling Indian Cricket Board sought Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s advice, the blunt answer they received was always: &quot;Duleep and I are English cricketers&quot;. Bose says Ranjitsinhji demonstrated duality. In England he was a cricketer and in India a ruler. It is argued that Ranjitsinhji saw cricket as a weapon for his own personal advancement. It is considered an irony that Ranjitsinhji has been called the &quot;Father of Indian Cricket&quot;.

==Playing style==
In his day, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s batting was regarded as innovative and history has come to look upon him as &quot;one of the most original stylists to have ever played the game&quot;. His great friend and Sussex captain, C. B. Fry commented on Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s &quot;distinctiveness&quot;, attributing it to &quot;a combination of perfect poise and the quickness peculiar to the athletic Hindu&quot;. Neville Cardus described English cricket, before the arrival of Ranjitsinhji as &quot;English through and through&quot;, but that when Ranjitsinhji batted, &quot;a strange light from the East flickered in the English sunshine&quot;. When Ranjitsinhji was appointed a Cricketer of the Year by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; in its 1897 annual, the editor wrote about individuality of his &quot;distinctive style of play&quot; and how that depended on, first, an &quot;extreme keenness of eye&quot; and, second, &quot;great power and flexibility of wrist&quot;.

==Jam Sahib of Nawanagar==

===Return to India===
Despite the discovery of an assassination plot on his life, in which Ranjitsinhji was implicated, Jassaji took over the administration of Nawanagar from the British in March 1903. Roland Wild later described it as &quot;the shattering of [Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s] dreams&quot;. During the 1904 season, Ranjitsinhji had a long meeting with Lord Curzon during a Sussex match. Immediately afterwards, he chose to miss three Championship games at short notice and visited Edith Borrisow in Gilling for 10 days; Simon Wilde suggests that Ranjitsinhji had at this point chosen to leave for India after the cricket season.

On 9 October 1904, Ranjitsinhji departed for India, accompanied by Archie MacLaren, with whom Ranjitsinhji had developed a close friendship on the tour to Australia in 1897–98, and who now became his personal secretary.

In India, Ranjitsinhji and MacLaren were joined by Mansur Khachar and Lord Hawke, the Yorkshire captain. Ranjitsinhji tried unsuccessfully to arrange an official meeting with Curzon to discuss the succession to Nawanagar and then chose to remain in India to cultivate his relationships with British officials, although there was little chance he could achieve much with regard to Nawanagar. MacLaren returned to England ready for the 1905 season, and Ranjitsinhji may have intended to follow. Instead, Mansur Khuchar discovered that Ranjitsinhji had attempted to trick him into providing more money and had repeatedly lied to him; in May 1905 he took Ranjitsinhji to Bombay High Court, insisting Ranjitsinhji repaid the money lent to him. This action kept him in India throughout 1905 and most of 1906 and prevented his return to England, where his absence was noted but could not be explained.

===Succession===
Although he had been in good health, Jassaji died on 14 August 1906 after developing a fever two weeks previously. Although no surviving papers suggest foul play, according to Simon Wilde there is circumstantial evidence that Jassaji may have been poisoned; at least one later ruler of Nawanagar believed that Ranjitsinhji had plotted Jassaji&#x27;s murder. Contrary to precedent, British officials did not make a decision over his successor for six months. The three major claimants who presented a case were Ranjitsinhji, Lakhuba and Jassaji&#x27;s widows. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s claim once again rested on his claim to have been adopted by Vibhaji; Lakhuba claimed the throne through his position as Vibhaji&#x27;s grandson, and like Ranjitsinhji, his prior claims had been rejected. Jassaji&#x27;s widows claimed through precedent that they should choose a successor as Jassaji had not done so.

Taking advantage of being in India, Ranjitsinhji quickly persuaded Mansur Khachar to withdraw his court claim in return for paying him in full upon his succession. He also secured declarations of direct or partial support from several other states. He also used British newspapers to further his claim. After examining the case, the British found in favour of Ranjitsinhji in December 1906, although the decision was not made public until the following February. Simon Wilde points out that the decision explicitly contradicted the evidence provided by the widows and seemingly ignored Vibhaji&#x27;s abandonment of Ranjitsinhji as heir. Nevertheless, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s popularity as a cricketer, his close connections with many of the British administrators and the fact that he was westernised from his time spent in England may all have been major factors in the decision according to Wilde.

An appeal from Lakhuba, which was eventually unsuccessful, delayed proceedings but Ranjitsinhji was installed as Jam Sahib on 11 March 1907. His full title was Colonel His Highness Shri Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji II, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, GCSI, GBE.

The installation was relatively simple for financial reasons as Nawanagar was poor; many items had to be borrowed from neighbouring states for the ceremony to reach the expected standard. Security was heavy and shortly after the ceremony and in unfamiliar surroundings, Ranjitsinhji secretly adopted a nephew as his heir.

Ranjitsinhji faced many challenges upon assuming control of Nawanagar. The state, following a drought several years before, was poor, suffered poverty and disease. In 1907, approximately thirty people were dying from disease each day in the capital city, Jamnagar. When he first saw it, Ranjitsinhji described Jamnagar as &quot;an evil slum&quot;. To provide funds, most of the state&#x27;s jewellery had been sold off. In a speech at Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s installation, Percy Fitzgerald, the British resident at Rajkot, made clear that the state needed to be modernised; for example, he said that Ranjtisinhji should develop the harbour at Salaya and extend the state&#x27;s railway, improve irrigation and reform the state&#x27;s administration. The British also took steps to reduce spending, concerned about his personal financial difficulties. According to Simon Wilde, Ranjitsinhji must have suffered from personal insecurity, moving to a region with which he was unfamiliar; furthermore, it is unlikely that his expectations before he became ruler were matched by the reality.

Possibly prompted by his difficulty adjusting, Ranjitsinhji made little progress in his first four months. He made enquiries into improving the collection of his land revenue, began to build a cricket pitch and went on shooting expeditions. Then in August 1907, he became seriously ill with typhoid, although he later claimed he had been poisoned. He recovered well, but his doctor reported to Fitzgerald that Ranjitsinhji needed a year in England to recover. Fitzgerald had misgivings about the level of expenditure involved and was concerned that opponents might plot while the ruler was away, but had to accept the decision.

===Controversy in England===
Upon arriving in England, Ranjitsinhji hired a country house at Shillinglee and spent much of his time entertaining guests, hunting and playing cricket. Freed from his previous financial difficulties, he seems to have tried to repay the hospitality he had enjoyed. However, he made no attempt to pay for his expensive lifestyle and ignored requests for payment of bills, mostly from tradesmen, with result he ran up considerable debts. Nevertheless, he came under increasing financial pressure throughout 1908. Mansur Khachar came to England in an attempt to recover his loan, and contacted the India Office. He claimed Ranjitsinhji repeatedly misled him, although he could not provide evidence for all of his statements. Ranjitsinhji denied many of the claims but agreed to repay the initial loan to prevent embarrassment if the story got out. He offered to repay half of the sum, but in the event gave back less than a quarter. Another dispute arose with Mary Tayler, an artist who was commissioned in April 1908 to create a miniature portrait of Ranjitsinhji at an agreed cost of 100 guineas for one and 180 guineas for a pair. Ranjitsinhji became increasingly uncooperative and when the finished work arrived two weeks afterwards, he eventually returned them, stating that he was dissatisfied with the likeness. In response, Tayler issued a writ for 180 guineas. When the case came up at Brighton county court, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s solicitor, Edward Hunt, claimed that as a ruling sovereign, English courts had no authority over him. However, the Secretary of State for India, Lord Morley, became involved and Hunt offered to make a settlement. By August, after a delay of seven weeks, Tayler was told that the matter could not be settled as MacLaren, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s secretary and a vital witness, was injured. But when Tayler discovered that this was untrue, she wrote to the India Office. She had no proof that a fee was agreed, but in November the India Office decided Ranjitsinhji should pay £75 as a gesture of good faith, and criticised Ranjitsinhji and &quot;his ridiculous private secretary&quot;. Ranjitsinhji also came before the courts over an 1896 loan covenant in a dispute between four women and himself and three other people. Ranjitsinhji had his name taken out of the claim on the grounds that he was a ruling sovereign, a view which was supported by the India Office.

During his visit Ranjitsinhji resumed his first-class cricket career in the 1908 season, and also visited the Borrisow family in Gilling East. At the time, he was contemplating marriage and locals believed he was in love with Edith Borrisow. While he may have pursued the matter, objections from her father and the potential scandal in both British and Rajput circles at a mixed-race marriage prevented anything coming of it. In August 1908, Ranjitsinhji became involved in fund raising to restore the bell-tower of Gilling East parish church and to furnish it with a clock; he organised a cricket match involving famous cricketers playing against a local team and raised money through the sale of a photograph.

By the end of the season, Ranjitsinhji was under pressure. At a farewell dinner to celebrate his cricket feats, some notable figures from cricket and the India Office were absent. Rumours spread over his financial unreliability and stories appeared in the press that he was considering abdication. He felt betrayed by the government and criticised it in a speech at the dinner, and he felt unfairly blamed for the financial controversy. However, Horatio Bottomley, a Liberal MP began to publicly criticise Ranjitsinhji in his magazine &quot;John Bull&quot; in October and November, drawing attention to his debts, the court cases and the claim that he was exempt from the law. Concerned and embarrassed by the negative publicity, the India Office advised Ranjitsinhji to be more careful with money. Ranjitsinhji wrote back that he was &quot;very hurt and annoyed at being continually thought ill of&quot;, and also defended himself in a letter to the &quot;Times&quot;. In December 1908, he returned to India although two months remained on his lease at Shillinglee.

===First years as ruler===
Ranjitsinhji returned from England to find that many of his staff had left and several assassination plans had been uncovered. Rumours spread that he was about to abdicate. Despite the help of British officials, he made several controversial decisions, accumulated expensive possessions and attempted to increase his income. He tried to reclaim land given away by previous rulers and although he reduced revenue taxation, he imposed an additional land rent which, coupled with severe drought, led to rebellion in some villages; Ranjitsinhji ordered his army to destroy them in retribution. The new resident at Rajkot, Claude Hill, was concerned by Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s actions early in 1909 and met him April 1909 to discuss his role and responsibilities. Meanwhile, in England Lord Edward Winterton, to whom Ranjitsinhji owed money from his lease of the Shillinglee Park property, asked questions in the House of Commons regarding Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s debts, visits to England and his actions as ruler of Nawanagar. As his state required his presence, the British advised him to leave at least four years between his visits to England. He did so at the earliest opportunity in 1912.

Ranjitsinhji resumed first-class cricket in 1912 but also had to face his many debts in England; his solicitor, Hunt, was questioned by the India Office, although Hunt reassured the officials that Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s debts were in hand. Lord Winterton once again asked questions in the House of Commons, this time about money Ranjitsinhji owed to the Coupe Company for architectural designs. Ranjitsinhji appeared himself at the India Office to answer questions on this particular debt and eventually paid back £500 of the £900 he owed. After spending time with Edith in Gilling, Ranjitsinhji returned to India in January 1913, pursued once more by rumours of impending marriage. Although Ranjitsinhji continued to state his intention to marry, and plans for a wedding were fairly developed, he never married. However, it is possible that Edith Borrisow stayed regularly at the palace.

===War service and loss of eye===
When the First World War began in August 1914, Ranjitsinhji declared that the resources of his state were available to Britain, including a house that he owned at Staines which was converted into a hospital. In November 1914, he left to serve at the Western Front, leaving Berthon as administrator. Ranjitsinhji was made an honorary major in the British Army, but as any serving Indian princes were not allowed near the fighting by the British because of the risk involved, he did not see active service. Ranjitsinhji went to France but the cold weather badly affected his health and he returned to England several times. On 31 August 1915, he took part in a grouse shooting party on the Yorkshire Moors near Langdale End. While on foot, he was accidentally shot in the right eye by another member of the party. After travelling to Leeds via the railway at Scarborough, a specialist removed the badly damaged eye on 2 August. Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s presence on a grouse shoot was a source of embarrassment to the authorities, who attempted to justify his presence in the area by hinting at his involvement in military business. He spent two months recuperating in Scarborough and after attending the funeral of W. G. Grace in Kent, he went to India for his sister&#x27;s marriage and did not return to England before the end of the war.

When Ranjitsinhji returned to India in 1915, Edith Borrisow remained in England. Her father died in 1917 and she and her sister moved away from Gilling, eventually settling in Staines (where Ranjitsinhji had a house). According to cricket writer E. H. D. Sewell, to whom Ranjitsinhji told the story, Ranjitsinhji asked Edith to marry him following her father&#x27;s death. However, she refused as she had fallen in love with someone else, and the engagement ended after 18 years. Sewell also claimed that her father had come to approve of the proposed marriage. However, the story may not be reliable and Simon Wilde speculates that Borrisow had simply tired of waiting and broke off the engagement. It is likely the pair remained friends, but Ranjitsinhji was deeply affected by the end of the relationship.

==Final years==
===Improvements in Nawanagar===

While Ranjitsinhji was in Europe at the start of the war, Berthon remained in Nawanagar as Administrator and began to implement modernisation programmes. He organised the clearance of slums in Jamnagar and new houses, shops and roads were built. Berthon&#x27;s improvements in irrigation meant that dry weather in 1923 was inconvenient but not disastrous like previous droughts. He also improved the state&#x27;s finances to the extent that the railway was finally extended as the British resident had suggested in 1907. Berthon continued in his role as Ranjitsinhji recovered from his injury, and the British Government wished him to remain in the position even when Ranjitsinhji was fully fit. Ranjitsinhji disagreed and threatened to abdicate if he was forced to retain Berthon. As a compromise, Berthon remained in Nawanagar but in an ostensibly more lowly position; in return, Ranjitsinhji was given more outward displays of favour, including the upgrading of Nawanagar to a 13-gun salute state and the centre of its liaison with the British was transferred from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India. Furthermore, Ranjitsinhji personally was entitled to a 15-gun salute and officially granted the title of Maharaja. Berthon retired in 1920 but remained close to Ranjitsinhji for many years.

Nawanagar&#x27;s finances were improved further by the construction of a port at Bedi. Encouraged by the British, the port was successful and thanks to favourable costs and charges it was used by many traders. As a consequence, Nawanagar&#x27;s revenue more than doubled between 1916 and 1925. Ranjitsinhji was therefore able to live in luxury. He acquired many properties in India, and while retaining his property in Staines in England, bought a castle in Ballynahinch on the west coast of Ireland. From 1920, he once more visited England but could now do so regularly and subsequently split his time each year between India and the British Isles.

However, according to journalist Simon Wilde, Ranjitsinhji was never happy. Possibly, he felt more at home in England and in the company of his British friends, and never felt a connection with Nawanagar. He was criticised for his failure to support Indian cricket, and his nephew Duleepsinhji later represented England in Test matches. Furthermore, his relations with British officials in India deteriorated over his final years, descending into disputes over minor matters, such as the refusal of the Bombay Gymkhana to give him membership.

Although Ranjitsinhji had no children, he was very close to his nephews and nieces; they lived in his palaces and he sent them to Britain to study. He encouraged his nephews to take up cricket, and several of them had minor success in school cricket. The most effective was Duleepsinhji; critics spotted a similarity to Ranjitsinhji in his style, and he had a successful county and Test career until he was forced to give up the game through illness in 1932. However, he felt pressured by Ranjitsinhji and said that he only played to keep Ranjitsinhji happy.

===Opposition to Federation and death===
For much of the remainder of his life, Ranjitsinhji devoted his time to supporting the interests of the Indian Princes. He attempted to unite his fellow princes against the advance of democracy, the Independence Movement and the growing hostility of the Indian National Congress. He was instrumental in the formation of the Chamber of Princes. Ranjitsinhji also secured a place on the Indian delegation to the League of Nations between 1920 and 1923, although he was a late replacement in 1922 and a substitute delegate in 1923. Providing extravagant hospitality to other delegates, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s delegation was popular and, according to Simon Wilde, &quot;managed to acquire influence beyond its real status in Geneva&quot;. Ranjitsinhji was assisted by his old friend and teammate C. B. Fry, who wrote his speeches. One such speech in 1923, made on behalf of the British Empire, was partly responsible for the withdrawal of the Italians from Corfu, which they had occupied. He also made a controversial speech in 1922 against the limits placed on the immigration of Indians into South Africa.

In 1927, Ranjitsinhji came under attack from the All India States Peoples Conference which accused him, among other things, of being an absentee ruler, high taxes and restricting liberties. He responded through supporting published works by different authors, including &quot;Jamnagar and its Ruler&quot; in 1927, &quot;Nawanagar and its Critics&quot; in 1929 and &quot;The Land of Ranji and Duleep&quot; in 1931. Although not entirely accurate, they attempted to answer some of the criticisms. Ranjitsinhji visited England in 1930, to take part in talks on India&#x27;s constitution. While there, he was well received by former cricketers and saw Duleepsinhji score 174 against Australia in a Test match at Lord&#x27;s. At the request of Sussex, he was president of the county for the year. He continued to oppose Indian federation, despite support for the idea from the British and some of the princes. He was chancellor to the Chamber of Princes in 1933, shortly before he died.

Ranjitsinhji died of heart failure on 2 April 1933 after a short illness. McLeod recounts that &quot;many&quot; contemporary observers attributed Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s death to an angry comment made publicly by Lord Willingdon, the Viceroy of India in the Chamber of Princes.

Ranjitsinhji had felt that he was speaking in defence of British interests and, &quot;The Morning Post&quot; said, &quot;Feeling himself rebuked by the Power he wished to save, ... he lost all desire to live&quot;.

Whether or not the dispute was the catalyst for his final illness, Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s health had gradually deteriorated in his final years. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered over the River Ganges.

His estate in England was worth £185,958 at his death (£13,610,242 in 2020 terms).

==Legacy==

Bateman&#x27;s work on cricket and the British Empire identifies Ranjitsinhji as an important figure in helping build &quot;imperial cohesion&quot;, adding that his &quot;cultural impact was immense&quot;. Bateman identifies in particular the use of Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s image during his era in advertising in England and Australia. This was a marked turnaround from the racism Ranjitsinhji had faced early in his career, which he had tried to overcome with techniques such as adopting the pseudonym, &quot;Smith&quot;. The popularity of an Indian playing cricket in England and for England was remarked upon during Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s era. W. G. Grace directly linked Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s celebrity to &quot;his extraordinary skill as a batsman and his nationality&quot;.

After his death, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) started the Ranji Trophy in 1934, with the first fixtures taking place in 1934–35. The trophy was donated by Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, who also inaugurated the competition. The Ranji Trophy is India&#x27;s national championship in first-class cricket and is contested by 38 teams representing several cities and states.

As a ruler, his legacy is more patchy. McLeod summarises his achievements at home as having &quot;remodelled his capital, constructed roads and railways, and built a great port with modern facilities&quot;. Due to his legacy on the cricket field, he is regarded as one of the best cricketers of Indian history. He is also regarded as being one of the finest batsmen to have played for the Sussex County Cricket Club.

<text>Will Rogers State Historic Park is a California State Historic Park in the Santa Monica Mountains, in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. The park was established in 1944 to preserve the estate of American humorist Will Rogers, including his ranch and the surrounding countryside. The ranch house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The ranch house and other structures were destroyed in the 2025 Palisades Wildfire.

==Geography==
Rogers built his ranch, where he lived with his wife Betty and their three children, Will Jr., Mary and James, in what is now the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, The 31-room ranch house, which included 11 baths and seven fireplaces, was surrounded by a stable, corrals, riding ring, roping arena, golf course, polo field—and riding and hiking trails that gave visitors views of the ranch and the surrounding countryside—186 acres (757,000 m2). The ranch became a State Park in 1944 after the death of Mrs. Rogers, and the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

California State Parks completed a major renovation of the ranch house in 2002–2006. The project included reconstruction of flagstone areas that surrounded the house, seismic safety work, replacement of electrical systems and installation of a new heating and air conditioning system. The house reopened to the public in March 2006.
Beyond the ranch and the stables are the trails that lead to views of the countryside around the park. Since Will Rogers State Historic Park is on the tip of the Santa Monica Mountains, the trails have vistas of both the sea and the mountains. Visitors can hike to Inspiration Point, take the Rogers trail around the perimeter of the park or continue on into Topanga State Park via the Backbone Trail System.

==History==
Beyond the Rogers&#x27; home, the ranch reflects Will Rogers&#x27; roots in horsemanship, starting with the polo field, which is the first thing the visitor sees when looking south from the parking area. The field is the only outdoor polo field in Los Angeles County, and the only field that is regulation size. The ranch has been in many movies and television shows, including &quot;Star Trek IV&quot;, in which it stood in for Golden Gate Park. The polo field features a gentle slope that forms an area for viewing the polo action. Up from the parking area are the ranch buildings, including the visitor center, which once was the Rogers&#x27; garage and ranch guest house. The visitor center features a film on the life of Will Rogers, photo mural displays, and literature regarding the Rogers family and their legacy reflected in the park.

The ranch buildings and grounds were maintained as they were when the Rogers family lived there in the late 1920s and 1930s. The living room of the main ranch house included a collection of Native American rugs and baskets, and several original Western art works by Charles M. Russell and Ed Borein. It also featured a porch swing in the center of the room and a mounted calf, which was given to Will Rogers to encourage him to rope the calf instead of his friends. The north wing of the house, also furnished in period, original family furnishings, contained the family bedrooms, Rogers&#x27; study, and the family parlor/sunroom.

Since 2006, the nature and historic interpretive goals of WRSHP under California State Parks operation have been amplified by stewardship and fundraising from the non-profit Will Rogers Ranch Foundation (WRRF). The WRRF board includes direct legacy lineage with the Rogers family — currently Will&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Jennifer Rogers Etcheverry. 

===Proposed closure in 2008===
Will Rogers State Historic Park was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by California&#x27;s Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program.

===2025 Palisades Fire===
On January 8, 2025, the ranch house and other structures were destroyed in the Palisades Wildfire, with the surrounding ranch also being severely damaged. State Parks was able to evacuate the horses, and some of the artwork and artifacts that were in the ranch house were saved.

<text>Football Club Utrecht () is a Dutch professional football club based in Utrecht. The club competes in the Eredivisie, the top tier of Dutch football, and plays its home matches at the Stadion Galgenwaard.

The club was formed in 1970 as a merger between local clubs VV DOS, USV Elinkwijk and Velox. Since then, the club has won three national cup tournaments: in 1985, 2003 and 2004, also winning the Johan Cruyff Shield in 2004 as the first club outside the traditional Dutch Big Three. Utrecht is also the only club outside the Big Three which has never suffered relegation from the top-flight Eredivisie.

Utrecht have competed in 15 European campaigns, reaching the group stages of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup and the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League, their best European results.

==History==

===1970–1979: Merger and early years===
In the late 1960s, the municipality of Utrecht initiated talks of a merger between the professional departments of VV DOS, Velox and USV Elinkwijk with the aim of continuing to guarantee professional football at top level in the city. DOS was the largest of the three clubs, and had won a national championship in 1958. With stout defensive tactics, the club had narrowly escaped relegation for three successive years, and mismanagement had left the club on the brink of bankruptcy. A cynical comment from that time was: &quot;The club can do nothing, not even relegate.&quot;

Merger plans were experienced less positively at Velox and Elinkwijk. Velox had been promoted to the Eerste Divisie in the early 1960s and had been close to achieving promotion to the Eredivisie a few times. In 1968, however, the team relegated to the third-tier Tweede Divisie again. Elinkwijk had been more successful than Velox. A &quot;yo-yo club&quot;, Elinkwijk alternated seasons in the bottom of the Eredivisie with seasons in the top of the Eerste Divisie. In addition, there was a sentiment in Elinkwijk that it was not originally an Utrecht-based club, but that it belonged more to the town of Zuilen which was an independent municipality until 1954. The club had no preference for the impending merger, but eventually gave in to pressure from the municipality. During the merger talks, Elinkwijk tried to secure a spot in the highest league of amateur football, but was instead placed in the Tweede Klasse. The following season, the club won the championship and as a result promoted to the Eerste Klasse.

On 1 July 1970, the merger became a fact and FC Utrecht was founded. Since VV DOS had managed to avoid relegation from the Eredivisie in the season before, the new club could immediately play at the highest level in its inaugural season. Utrechts&#x27;s home ground became Stadion Galgenwaard, which had previously been the VV DOS home ground, the largest stadium of the three parent clubs. The first manager of Utrecht became Bert Jacobs, the then 29-year-old head coach of Velox, who was joined by 24-year-old Fritz Korbach from USV Elinkwijk as assistant. Their assignment was to forge one club with one culture from its three cores and three different identities.

In the first season, the Utrecht first-team squad consisted almost entirely of former players from DOS, Velox and USV Elinkwijk. Only one outside player was recruited, as defender Co Adriaanse was signed for ƒ 125,000 from De Volewijckers from Amsterdam. The core of the squad also consisted of former DOS players Cor Hildebrand, Ed van Stijn, Piet van Oudenallen, Tom Nieuwenhuys and John Steen Olsen, former Elinkwijk players Joop Leliveld, Jan Blaauw, Dick Teunissen and Jan Groenendijk and former Velox player Marco Cabo. Their first official match was against defending European Cup winners Feyenoord. Groenendijk scored Utrecht&#x27;s first goal, but despite the 0–1 lead, the team eventually lost 4–1. The club finished in 9th place in its inaugural season, a solid midtable finish.

===1980–1990: Near bankruptcy and revival===
In the first ten years of its existence, Utrecht grew steadily. Important players from that period were Hans van Breukelen, Leo van Veen and Willem van Hanegem. In the early 1980s, it was decided to construct a new stadium, which was called Nieuw Galgenwaard.

The tide turned in 1981 when the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) opened an investigation into the club. They could reveal a series of financial malpractices, including transfer and salary costs of various players being financed illegally. Between 1976 and 1980, the club had not paid national insurance contributions and taxes on signing bonuses. In addition, there had been committed fraud with receipts. The club could not meet the stated additional tax and was placed under a debt moratorium. Bankruptcy, at that point, seemed inevitable. Various campaigns were organised by players and supporters, and through a petition, the club managed to collect 66,000 signatures for the retention of the club. Under the leadership of goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen, first-team players went canvassing with FC Utrecht merchandise and recorded a single entitled &quot;We geven het niet op&quot; (&quot;We don&#x27;t give up&quot;). The municipality of Utrecht eventually decided to respond to the massive local support and covered expenses.

The early 1980s, under the leadership of head coach and former player Han Berger, were successful. The team finished in fifth place in 1980, third in 1981 and fifth place in 1982 of the Eredivisie and in 1982 the club also reached the KNVB Cup final, which was lost to AZ &#x27;67. The team also played European football for the first time in club history. The success was in large part due to the large number of youth players that broke through to the first team during these years. Out of eighteen first-team players reaching the cup final in 1982, fourteen were academy players, including van Breukelen, Gert Kruys, Willy Carbo and Ton de Kruijk. Many of these players, such as Leo van Veen, Frans Adelaar, Willem van Hanegem, Ton du Chatinier and Jan Wouters, would later return to the club as managers.

Although the club went through a golden era results-wise, the club was far from healthy financially. To keep the club afloat, key players were let go every season. Van Breukelen left for Nottingham Forest in 1982, Carbo for Club Brugge in 1983 and Rob de Wit for Ajax in 1983. As a result, Utrecht dropped from a near-top side to more mid-table finishes in the Eredivisie table in the mid-1980s.

On 1 April 1985, &quot;Utrechts Nieuwsblad&quot; published an article about an imminent takeover of the club. A consortium of, among others, the English newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell, Philips, KLM and Johan Cruyff, were said to have plans to invest heavily in Utrecht and acquire a majority shareholding. The supporters of the club were strongly against the takeover, however, especially due to the interference of Ajax legend, Cruyff. Ultimately, the takeover failed.

===1991–2005: Troubled 1990s, success and tragedy===

After a number of weaker years, Utrecht reached fourth place in the Eredivisie in 1990–91, led by manager Ab Fafié and with players such as Johan de Kock, Jan Willem van Ede and Rob Alflen and top goalscorer of the season, Włodzimierz Smolarek. After this, however, things went downhill for the club. Because Utrecht missed out on European qualification, incomes were lost. Between 1989 and 1996, six managers led the team and there were just as many changes in the board of directors. Quarrels and financial issues arose, which again meant that key players had to be sold to close the holes in the budget. Alflen left for Ajax in 1991, de Kock left for Roda JC in 1994 and Ferdi Vierklau moved to Vitesse in 1996.

Main sponsor AMEV intervened in the dire financial situation in 1996. The club received a financial injection in exchange for a substantial shareholder position. The insurance company appointed Hans Herremans as club chairman. Many investments were made immediately in 1996, as Errol Refos, Rob Witschge and former Utrecht player John van Loen came over from Feyenoord, Reinier Robbemond from Dordrecht, Dick van Burik from NAC and Michael Mols from Twente. Ronald Spelbos was appointed manager with Jan Wouters as assistant. In 1998, a complete renovation of the Stadion Galgenwaard was initiated, designed by ZJA Zwarts &amp; Jansma Architecten.

Despite the capital injection, successes on the pitch failed to materialise during the first years, and a number of managers were hired and fired in rapid succession. In 1993, the team reached a relatively successful eighth place, but for the next eight years, until 2001, the club was unable climb to a higher position than tenth place in the table. In 1994 and 1996, the club even finished 15th, just above the relegation spots. In 1996, the team won only six matches, including an important 1–2 win at Twente, which meant that the promotion/relegation play-offs were avoided. Only in 2001, Utrecht managed to achieve European qualification again with a fifth-place finish, led by former player Frans Adelaar, who had become manager. Utrecht finished with the same number of points as RKC Waalwijk, Roda JC and Vitesse, but secured fifth place on goal difference. In 2002, the team lost the final of the KNVB Cup to Ajax, but in 2003 and 2004, the team, which had come under the leadership of Foeke Booy, managed to win the cup. Important players in this period included Dirk Kuyt, Tom Van Mol, Jean-Paul de Jong, Pascal Bosschaart and Stijn Vreven. In 2004, the Johan Cruyff Shield was also won at the expense of Ajax (2–4), as Hans Somers claimed a key role with two crucial goals.

As a result of, among other things, a new financial crisis and a lack of lucrative transfers, Utrecht was again on the brink of collapse in the spring of 2003. There was no more money to pay Midreth, the company responsible for constructing the renovation of the stadium. At that time, the stadium was largely finished. Since the material for the construction had already been delivered, the construction company advanced the costs, about € 5.5 million. However, this once again left the club with a substantial debt. Bankruptcy was averted with a remediation and the sale of all properties, including the stadium, to, among others, the municipality of Utrecht and Midreth. In the following years, FC Utrecht returned to the mid-table of the Eredivisie.

On 29 November 2005, French defender and fan favourite, David Di Tommaso died suddenly at the age of 26. Di Tommaso had suffered a cardiac arrest in his sleep. The club subsequently retired Di Tommaso&#x27;s kit number, 4. At the end of each season, the &quot;David Di Tommaso Trophy&quot; is awarded to the player who was considered of the most valuable that season by fans; the winner is determined by an internet poll. Before his death, Di Tommaso had been the most recent winner of the FC Utrecht Player of the Year, and the award was named after him since then.

===2005–2008: Phanos takeover===

After the averted bankruptcy of 2003, Utrecht, despite participating in the UEFA Cup in 2003 and 2004, was no longer able to get out of debt. In July 2007, real estate company Phanos first showed interest in taking over the club. For the symbolic amount of €1, Phanos wanted to take over the club, including all outstanding debts. The company then intended to demolish the existing stadium to make the site available for housing. The company would then build a new stadium near the new Leidsche Rijn district. Phanos also wanted the club to become a serious contender in the Eredivisie by means of financial injections. The plan was met with a lot of resistance from supporters, as the Stadion Galgenwaard had seen a radical renovation recently.

Subsequently, a conflict broke out between chairman Jan Willem van Dop, who had come over as director of Feyenoord in 2005, and the supervisory board. The board accused Van Dop of financial mismanagement, poor communication and egotistical behavior, including the recruitment of manager Willem van Hanegem and striker Kevin Vandenbergh. On 3 September 2007, van Dop was relieved from his duties as chairman, but was put back in office three days later after summary proceedings. As a result, the entire supervisory board decided to step down.

===2008–present: Van Seumeren era===
On 2 April 2008, the Utrecht board announced in a press conference that the club had found a suitable takeover candidate in entrepreneur Frans van Seumeren, former director of the Mammoet logistics company. Van Seumeren acquired 63% of the shares of Utrecht bv for €16 million. He promised to commit to the club for a period of at least ten years and to reinvest any proceeds in the club. He set the goal that the club had to reconnect with the subtop of the league table within a few years, comparable to a club like Heerenveen. Van Seumeren took place in the new supervisory board, of which Jacques van Ek became chairman. Despite the fact that previous takeover candidate Phanos had failed to comply with the agreement between Utrecht and van Seumeren, they remained affiliated with the club as main shirt sponsor until March 2011.

In his role as new owner of the club, van Seumeren was actively involved in the club&#x27;s footballing policy. In the summer of 2008, against the wishes of head coach van Hanegem, he meddled with the composition of the technical staff by replacing assistant coaches John van Loen and David Nascimento, strength and conditioning coach Rob Druppers and goalkeeping coach Maarten Arts. At the end of 2008, he fired van Hanegem, after he had repeatedly expressed negative opinion on van Seumeren. Technical director Piet Buter also left afterwards. They were replaced by the duo Ton du Chatinier and Foeke Booy as head coach and technical advisor, respectively.

In 2011, chairman van Dop left Utrecht. In the same year, Wilco van Schaik was appointed as new director of the club. The change of function endorsed the conversion of Utrecht from a football association to a &quot;vennootschap&quot; (private limited company). Du Chatinier was sacked in the summer of 2011 and replaced by assistant Jan Wouters. Despite having a successful resume in terms of player sales and signings, Booy was also let go in 2012 after disappointing results on the pitch. In the 2012–13 season, Utrecht would go on to have one its best seasons historical seasons, finishing fifth in the league table, winning the play-offs for European football and equaling the club points record from 1981 (63 points). The following season, however, turned out to be a setback; Utrecht was eliminated in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League by Differdange 03 from Luxembourg. Utrecht eventually finished tenth in the league.

When Wouters decided not to renew his contract in 2014, after having been head coach for three years, a new direction was taken in terms of technical policy. Co Adriaanse was appointed as technical advisor, a position that has been vacant since Booy&#x27;s departure in 2012. Adriaanse obtained an advisory, but not binding, voice in player policy, and was given powers in composing the club&#x27;s coaching staff. Rob Alflen, assistant under Wouters, would provide the training sessions. The pair were hired with the purpose of making Utrecht play more attacking, attractive football.

Alflen disappointed, only leading Utrecht to eleventh place in the league table, and he was let go after only one season in charge in 2015. Erik ten Hag was appointed as his replacement, coming from a position as Bayern Munich II manager. Club icon Jean-Paul de Jong was appointed as his assistant. Adriaanse also left the club, with Ten Hag taking the extra role as technical manager. The 2015–16 season proved to be highly successful, with Utrecht ending in fifth place of the Eredivisie table and reaching the KNVB Cup final, which was lost 2–1 to Feyenoord. Utrecht would also lose the final of the play-offs for European football to Heracles Almelo. The reserves team of the club, Jong Utrecht, however, became champions of the Beloften Eredivisie in the 2015–16 season. With changes made to the Dutch football league system, Jong Utrecht was therefore promoted to the second-tier Eerste Divisie.

In the 2016–17 season, Utrecht secured a fourth-place finish with two match-days left to play. In the final of the play-offs for European football, they beat AZ Alkmaar was after an exciting diptych (0–3, 3–0, 4–3 after penalty shoot-out). As a result of Utrecht&#x27;s success, Ten Hag was appointed new head coach of Ajax with assistant De Jong taking over as head coach on 1 January 2018.

==Stadium==
Utrecht&#x27;s stadium is the Stadion Galgenwaard, previously named the Galgenwaard, then later the Nieuw Galgenwaard. It has a current capacity of 23,750 spectators. The attendance on average was 19,600 people in 2004–05, while the average attendance rose to 20,004 in 2006–07. The 2023–24 season saw an alltime high in average attendance with 20,500 people visiting on average. The stadium also accommodates several shops, offices and the supporters home of the Utrecht fan club (Supporters Vereniging Utrecht), one of the largest of its kind in Europe.

<doc id="834236" wikidata="Q5475037" url="?curid=834236" title="Four Bitchin' Babes">
<text>The Four Bitchin&#x27; Babes is a group of female singer-songwriters with rotating membership performing mainly humorous, satirical, or light-hearted songs in the folk genre. The current touring group consists of Sally Fingerett, Deirdre Flint, Christine Lavin, and Debi Smith. The artists have made numerous albums and have worked with producer Jeff Bova.

== History ==
Christine Lavin founded the band in 1990. She produced the compilation album &quot;On a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot;, then put together a road show of the artists who appeared on it: Patty Larkin, Megon McDonough, Sally Fingerett, and Lavin. The foursome toured throughout the United States, after which Lavin decided to create a live album of their performance at The Birchmere entitled &quot;Buy Me, Bring Me, Take Me, Don&#x27;t Mess My Hair&quot;, released on Rounder Records in 1990.

Larkin then signed with Windham Hill Records and left the band; she was replaced by Julie Gold, best known for writing the song &quot;From a Distance&quot;. The group continued to tour and released their second album, &quot;Buy Me… Volume II&quot; in 1993. In the meantime, other artists would substitute in concert for band members who were unavailable, such as Cheryl Wheeler, Janis Ian, and Mary Travers. In 1994, Debi Smith replaced Julie Gold, and they released their third album &quot;Fax It, Charge It, Don&#x27;t Ask Me What&#x27;s For Dinner&quot; in 1995 on Shanachie Records.

In 1997, Lavin chose Camille West to replace her in the band, and the new lineup released the live album &quot;Gabby Road: Out Of The Mouths Of Babes&quot;, also recorded at the Birchmere. In 2001, the band released the album &quot;The Babes: Beyond Bitchin&quot;″, produced by Jeff Bova, in addition to a live concert DVD. McDonough left the band in 2001 to perform a one-woman show, and she was replaced by Suzzy Roche, formerly of The Roches. In 2002, they released the album &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot;. In 2004, both West and Roche left the group and were replaced by Nancy Moran and Deirdre Flint. In 2006, they toured for their CD &quot;Hormonal Imbalance: A Mood Swinging Musical Revue&quot;.

As of June 2022, the Four Bitch&#x27; Babes are touring, including a stop at The Birchmere, where they recorded their first album and see as an &quot;unofficial home base&quot;. It may be their last formal tour and Smith, one of the co-leaders, says &quot;We are winding it down&quot;.

There have been eleven different members (not counting guest or touring &quot;Babes&quot;), with the Four Bitchin&#x27; Babes currently consisting of Sally Fingerett, Deirdre Flint, Christine Lavin, and Debi Smith. Only Fingerett has been a member for their entire history.

== Songwriting ==
Typically, the Babes&#x27; albums consist of songs written by the individual members, all of whom have or have had solo careers as well. Songs appearing on their albums, such as &quot;Microwave Life&quot; (by McDonough), &quot;B.O.B. (Battery-Operated Boyfriend)&quot; and &quot;L.A.F.F. (Ladies Against Fanny Floss)&quot; (by West), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Me (I&#x27;m Somebody&#x27;s Mother)&quot; (by Fingerett), satirize modern life, especially from a mature female perspective.

==Deirdre Flint==
Deirdre Flint is an American satirical folk-rock singer-songwriter. A former elementary school teacher, she joined Four Bitchin&#x27; Babes in 2005.

Her music has appeared on the Dr. Demento radio show and on the television show &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, as well as on The Learning Channel&#x27;s &quot;A Dating Story&quot; and documentary &quot;Always A Bridesmaid&quot;. Her songs, such as &quot;Cheerleader,&quot; &quot;The Boob Fairy,&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regressed,&quot; deal with offbeat topics, often from the perspective of a ditzy female character. She has performed in more than 50 venues across the United States, including The Kennedy Center, and has been reviewed in publications such as &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;, which called her &quot;Shuffleboard Queens&quot; album, &quot;grown-up satire with a non-cynical wink&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Flint won the New Folk songwriting prize at the Kerrville Folk Festival in 2000, and was Falcon Ridge Folk Festival Showcase Artist that same year.

<text>SBV Vitesse Arnhem (&quot;Stichting Betaald Voetbal Vitesse Arnhem, Eng: Professional Football Foundation Vitesse Arnhem&quot;), widely known as Vitesse () or internationally known as Vitesse Arnhem, is a Dutch professional football club located in the municipality of Arnhem. Established on 14 May 1892, they currently play in the Eerste Divisie following relegation from the 2023–24 Eredivisie. Since 1998, the club has played its home games at the GelreDome.

Vitesse had its most successful period in the 1990s. Their best result in the Eredivisie was third place in 1997–98. They won the KNVB Cup in 2017 and also reached the final in 1912, 1927, 1990 and 2021. Throughout the years, Vitesse established itself as a stepping stone for future top class players like Raimond van der Gouw, Phillip Cocu, Roy Makaay, Sander Westerveld, Nikos Machlas, Mahamadou Diarra, Nemanja Matić, Wilfried Bony, Bertrand Traoré, Robin Gosens, Lewis Baker, Dominic Solanke, Martin Ødegaard, Milot Rashica and Mason Mount.

==History==


Vitesse, founded in 1892, is the 2nd oldest professional football club still in existence in the Netherlands, after Sparta Rotterdam who were formed in 1888. The roots of Vitesse actually pre-dated Sparta by a year as in 1887, a club with the name &quot;Arnhemsche cricket- en voetbalvereeniging Vitesse&quot; was formed by a group of high school students who played their sport on the Rijnkade, overlooking the River Rhine in the city centre. Reluctant to choose a Latin or English name for the club as they felt those languages were too elitist, they picked the French word &quot;Vitesse&quot;, meaning &quot;speed&quot;.

In 1891 the club disbanded as they were no longer able to find anywhere suitable to play cricket after a Velodrome was built on their usual playing field in the Klarenbeek Park. The following year a group of wealthy students resurrected the sports club, this time with the name AVC (Arnhemse Voetbal en Cricketclub) Vitesse. In the summer they played cricket and in the winter football. In the end of 1892, Vitesse played its first real football match, and in 1894 Vitesse disbanded the cricket branch. In 1895 and 1896 Vitesse became champions of the Gelderland competition. From the foundation of the Netherlands national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided by play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league. Vitesse lost the final of the national championship six times &quot;(1898, 1899, 1903, 1913, 1914 and 1915)&quot;.

In 1912, Vitesse reached the final of the Dutch Cup Tournament for the first time. Vitesse lost the final with 0–2 from HFC Haarlem. In this period Vitesse had top players, likes Willem Hesselink and Just Göbel. These players were also active in the Netherlands national team. In 1914 John William Sutcliffe became the first foreign trainer.

During World War II, Vitesse did not play-official matches because playing football in the open air was forbidden. During the Battle of Arnhem, the residents of the city were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war. The football field and clubhouse was completely destroyed. The damage was repaired in the years after the liberation.

In 1984 it was decided to divide the professional and amateur sections of the club. The professional section was renamed SBV (Stichting Betaald Voetbal – &quot;Professional Football Foundation&quot;) Vitesse whilst the amateur section became &quot;Vitesse 1892&quot;, which lasted until they disbanded in 2009.

From 1984, Karel Aalbers was the president of SBV Vitesse. Aalbers&#x27; goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the Second League (Eerste divisie, now Jupiler League), the league in which the club originated, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe. He developed the basic idea for the &#x27;Gelredome&#x27;, a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in Gelsenkirchen (Schalke 04) and in Japan. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed. It is fully climate controlled as well. In the first season after the opening, Gelredome&#x27;s attendance rose to 20,000, (from less than 8,000 in the old stadium).

Vitesse made their debut in European competition in 1990. The club won their first match in the first round 1–0 over Derry City.

The club remained financially sound through making notable profits on the transfer market. Players such as Roy Makaay, Sander Westerveld, Nikos Machlas, Glenn Helder and Philip Cocu were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as Mahamadou Diarra and Pierre van Hooijdonk. Vitesse finished in the top four positions, made profits and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of Aalbers&#x27; presidency. Also, the club became regular competitors in the UEFA Cup and in 1997–1998 finished third in the Eredivise, its record highest finish to date.

Herbert Neumann was Vitesse&#x27;s manager over most of these years (1992–95 and 1998–99), while star players included: Nikos Machlas, the first ever Vitesse player to win the European Golden Boot in 1998 when he scored 34 goals in a season; John van den Brom, who played 378 matches for Vitesse during this period scoring 110 goals from midfield; and Edward Sturing, who played 383 matches in defence for Vitesse from 1987 to 1998, as well as receiving 3 caps for the Netherlands national team. Additional stars included Dejan Čurović, who spent six years at Vitesse playing 109 matches as a striker, scoring 41 goals including the first goal in GelreDome. Meanwhile, Dutch forward Roy Makaay spent four years at Vitesse, scoring 42 goals in 109 matches between 1993 and 1997.

Aalbers resigned on 15 February 2000, after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, as a public utility company owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers&#x27; ambitious plans. His successor was Jan Koning (former chief of Sara Lee/DE who resigned after four months). In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought off, under the threat of bankruptcy.

The club was in serious financial trouble, and in August 2010 its majority shareholder agreed to sell the club to the Georgian businessman Merab Jordania. There were rumors in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and various news outlets that this purchase was engineered by former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The club underwent a successful transformation into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself as one of the dominant teams of the Eredivisie.

On 1 July 2012, Fred Rutten signed a contract as the new manager of Vitesse, for the season 2012-13. Rutten left Vitesse after the season, finishing in fourth place. Wilfried Bony ended the season as the Eredivisie&#x27;s top scorer with 31 goals in 30 matches and was awarded the Golden Shoe for the best player in the Netherlands.

For the 2013–14 season, Vitesse appointed Peter Bosz as its new manager. In November 2013, Vitesse was top of the league in the Eredivisie for the first time since 2006. It was the first time since 2000 they&#x27;d been top of the league later than the first week. Halfway through the season, after 17 matches, Vitesse was the leader in the competition. Key players in the squad from this period included Davy Pröpper, Christian Atsu and Bertrand Traoré.

Vitesse announced on 13 June 2016 that Henk Fraser would replace Bosz at the start of the 2016–17 season. In his first full season, won the club first major trophy in its 125-year existence. Fraser defeating AZ by a score of 2−0 in the final of the KNVB Cup, with two goals from Ricky van Wolfswinkel. On 5 August 2017 Vitesse were beaten 1–1 &quot;(4–2 pen.)&quot; at De Kuip, Rotterdam in the Johan Cruyff Shield final by Feyenoord. In the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League group stage, Vitesse&#x27;s opponents were Lazio, Nice and Zulte Waregem. Vitesse ultimately finished the group stage in fourth place. In October 2017, Guram Kashia wore a rainbow-striped captain&#x27;s armband for Vitesse against Heracles Almelo in support of LGBT rights, leading to a backlash in his own country. In August 2018, he became the inaugural recipient of UEFA&#x27;s #EqualGame award for his act.

In 2021, after beating VVV-Venlo in the semi-final, Vitesse reached the KNVB Cup Final for the fifth time in their history. Vitesse lost the final 2–1 to Ajax. Vitesse finished the 2020–21 Eredivise season in fourth place. In July and August 2021, Vitesse qualified for the UEFA Europa Conference League. Vitesse knocked-out Dundalk (2-2 and 2–1) and Anderlecht (3-3 and 2–1) in the qualifiers. On 27 August, Vitesse was drawn on Group G of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League alongside Tottenham Hotspur, Rennes and Mura. Vitesse eventually placed second in the group, making it to the round of 32.

Towards the end of the 2023–24 Eredivisie season, Vitesse was relegated after being deducted eighteen points for failing to comply with the KNVB&#x27;s license requirements amid continuous financial troubles.

==Stadium and training facilities==

The club plays its home games at the GelreDome stadium, with a capacity of 21,000 seats. The GelreDome was built to serve as a multifunctional stadium suited for sports, concerts and other events. It was the first football stadium in the world to have a retractable pitch, and, after the Amsterdam ArenA, the second stadium in Europe to have a sliding roof. The pitch is surrounded on each side by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Edward Sturing Stand (North), Charly Bosveld Stand (East), Theo Bos Stand (South) and Just Göbel Stand (West).

The idea of building a multifunctional stadium, which had more than double the capacity of Vitesse&#x27;s old Nieuw Monnikenhuize stadium, came from former Vitesse chairman Karel Aalbers. The ambitious chairman had been playing with the idea from as early as the late 1980s, but it took until 1996 and the prospect of the upcoming Euro 2000 championships for construction to finally begin. The GelreDome opened two years later, on 25 March 1998, with a league match between Vitesse and NAC Breda (4–1). Three international matches of the Netherlands national football team were played in the stadium, the first one being on 27 May 1998: a friendly against Cameroon (0–1). The last one, played on 26 April 2000, was also a friendly: a 0–0 against Scotland. In 2019, the Netherlands women&#x27;s national team, also played their an international (friendly) match at the stadium. Furthermore, the GelreDome was the location for three UEFA Euro 2000 group stage matches, as well as the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship tournament.

Vitesse&#x27;s training facilities are conducted at National Sports Centre Papendal, located in the outskirts of Arnhem in woodland surroundings. The training ground consists of several pitches, a number of which have an artificial turf pitch, and extensive training facilities, including a fitness centre. Papendal, a mere twelve kilometers north of the GelreDome, is not only the training facility for Vitesse&#x27;s first team; the youth teams play their home matches here as well. Its main field has seating capacity for 500 people. The complex is situated in large wooded area, where the players can prepare in a peaceful and private environment, whilst not being too far from the hustle and bustle of Arnhem&#x27;s city centre. Papendal is also the base for administration staff, scouting department and all club coaches.

=== Stadium history ===
==Symbols==

===Hertog===
Vitesse are well known for the American bald Eagle &#x27;Hertog&#x27;, which is released before the match and flies over the crowds.

===Anthems===
Vitesse fans are known to be creative and have various songs and chants during matches. Among the most important Vitesse songs are &quot;Geel en Zwart zijn onze kleuren&quot; by Emile Hartkamp, &quot;Ernems Trots&quot; by Joey Hartkamp, and &quot;Bouw mee aan een steengoed Vites!&quot; by Henk Bleker &amp; Enka Harmonie. Vitesse opens its home matches with &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; by Status Quo, and after every home goal &quot;Bro Hymn&quot; by Pennywise is played.

===Mr Vitesse===
Theo Bos was raised in Arnhem and started playing football from an early age. He began his career at amateur club Sv Sempre Avanti and played from 1979 to 1983 in the academy of Vitesse. Manager Leen Looijen gave him his professional debut on 13 August 1983 against FC Wageningen; the match ended in a 3–0 victory for Vitesse. Bos spent his entire playing career for Vitesse, making a total 369 appearances in 14 seasons with his club. After his playing career, Bos worked at Vitesse as youth coach, assistant coach and manager. He is therefore considered to be &quot;Mister Vitesse&quot;. In 2012, the south stand of the GelreDome stadium was named the Theo Bos Stand. Bos died on 28 February 2013 of pancreatic cancer, aged forty-seven. Following his death, a special remembrance to honour Theo Bos took place at Gelredome with around 7,000 Vitesse supporters. As of the 2012–13 season, no player will wear the number 4 shirt at Vitesse after the club decided to retire the shirt out of respect for Theo Bos, &quot;the legendary number four&quot;. Dutch defender Jan-Arie van der Heijden was the last player to wear the number. In November 2013, his biography &quot;Het is zoals het is&quot; (&#x27;It is what it is&#x27;) was published, written by journalist Marcel van Roosmalen. In 2015, a statue of Bos was erected outside of the training complex at Papendal.

===Airborne-match===

Around September there is an annual &#x27;Airborne memorial&#x27; football match. During this annual Airborne-match the veterans of World War II will be honored. The Gelredome is decorated with Airborne flags, both outside and inside the stadium, and at halftime, 120 members of the Royal British Legion played the bagpipes with some other musical guests. Clubsymbol Hertog fly with the typical Airborne colours. The match is traditionally visited by veterans who were fighting in this battle, while a special shirt is worn by Vitesse. The club drop their normal striped black and yellow kit for this special match. Instead they wear claret and blue outfits, the same colours of the 1st Airborne Division, with a 1st Airborne &#x27;winged horse&#x27; emblem also etched on the kit. Pictured on the collar sticker is the John Frost Bridge. These shirts are after the match auctioned for charity. In addition, Vitesse wearing a special captain&#x27;s armband as a sign of recognition and respect for those who have fought for our freedom. In the 2014–15 and 2019–20 seasons, Vitesse played their away games in the same colours of the 1st Airborne Division.

===Colours and badge===
Originally, Vitesse played in white shirts with a blue sash from inception until 1900, paying hommage to the city&#x27;s colours. At the turn of the century, player Reinhard Jan Christiaan baron van Pallandt offered to sponsor the club&#x27;s shirts in exchange for Vitesse switching to his family colours of black and yellow. The board were quick to accept, noting that Vitesse, being one of the strongest team in the province of Gelderland, would be vindicated in playing in what could also be considered the province&#x27;s colours (the flag of Gelderland is a tricolour in blue, yellow, and black).

The first logo of Vitesse was a shield-shaped crest. In the middle there was a diagonal dividing line between the left yellow face and the right black box. In the left box, &quot;AVC Vitesse&quot; was diagonally written and in the right-hand side, &quot;1892 &quot;, the club&#x27;s founding year. The old logo was replaced in 1984, the year in which the roads of the BVO branch and the amateur branch separated. The amateur branch retained the logo with limited modification, SBV Vitesse got a new logo.

The new logo of the BVO from 1984 is once again a shield-shaped figure, but it has straight lines at both the top and sides of the logo. At the top is with thick white uppercase Vitesse. Under the name is a double-headed eagle counterchanged on a black and yellow field. This double-headed eagle can also be found in the coat of arms of Arnhem. In the middle of the logo is a football.

In the autumn of 2011, a new version of the logo was put into use; a total of 13 changes were made. For example, the symmetry of the eagle was improved, the black outer edge replaced by a white and in the writing has been made thinner. The football has been altered in terms of appearance as a shadow effect is added and (if the context allows it) the year of creation as text EST. 1892 under the logo can be found.

===Kit manufacturers and sponsors===
Since 2023 Vitesse&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Robey. Previous manufacturers include Adidas (1982–89), Hummel (1989–90), Bukta

==Support==

The supporters of the club are known as &quot;Vitessenaren&quot;. Vitesse has two independent fan bodies. The &quot;Supportersvereniging Vitesse&quot; was founded in 1992 and currently consists of 3,000 members. They own a fan base within the GelreDome. The second one, &quot;Arnhem Ultras&quot;, serve a more specific purpose: to improve the atmosphere in the stadium. Besides the fan unions, there are several sets of fans who work together on tifo choreography, likes &quot;VIVO (Vitesse Is van Ons)&quot;, &quot;De Aftrap&quot;, &quot;VAK 113&quot;, &quot;VAK 212&quot;, &quot;RFFC&quot;, &quot;Crew 81&quot; and &quot;BGN&quot; among others. Nowadays, Vitesse is supported by one fanatic side: The &quot;Theo Bos – South Stand&quot;. This stand is responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium.

Vitesse have attracted around 18,000 people to Eredivisie matches on average in the last years. The record attendance stands at 26,600, achieved in a match against NAC Breda at 25 March 1998. Research showed that about 10,000 season ticket holders from Gelderland, with other significant groups coming from Utrecht, South Holland and North Rhine-Westphalia.

The &quot;Vitesse Kids Club&quot; was founded by Vitesse in 1998 for children up to 16 years. Every year, the &quot;Vitesse Kids Club Day&quot; is organized, offering activities for members who are joined by the first team squad. During pre-season, Vitesse also holds an Open Day for people of all ages; the event gives the opportunity for sponsors and new player signings to be presented.

Vitesse fans have established a close friendship with the supporters of Petrolul Ploiești and RFC Liège. Previously, they had a friendship with Lierse until there was a big riot between them at a friendly match in 2011.

==Rivalries==
=== Rivalry with NEC ===
N.E.C. from Nijmegen are Vitesse&#x27;s archrivals. The two clubs share a long history together and matches between the two clubs are called the Gelderse Derby &quot;(Derby of Gelderland)&quot;. The rivalry between these two clubs goes beyond the football rivalry, it transcends into the city rivalry between the two largest cities of Gelderland: Nijmegen and Arnhem. This city rivalry began when these two cities first received their city rights. The two cities are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that local pride is at stake. The meeting between the two teams is still considered to be one of the biggest matches of the season.

The inhabitants of these cities differ extremely in both attitudes and cultures which is clearly reflected on the football pitch. Vitesse&#x27;s style of play has long been a source of pride for the supporters, and one of irritation for the NEC fans.

Since 1813, Arnhem has been the capital of Gelderland, historically based on finance and trade. Arnhem is perceived as an office city with modern buildings. Nijmegen, on the other hand, is predominantly a workers&#x27; city, with middle and high-income groups in the minority. People from Nijmegen see Arnhem as arrogant and lazy.



===Rivalries with other clubs===
De Graafschap are also a rival of Vitesse, but in terms of tension and rivalry, these matches are not as loaded as the duels with NEC Nijmegen. The rivalry has existed for some time with De Graafschap and stems from various causes, such as the opposition between the large city (Arnhem) and the countryside (Doetinchem).

Further teams who share a rivalry with Vitesse include Twente, Utrecht and Ajax. Past rivalries include local derbies between Vitesse and clubs such as FC Wageningen, Go Ahead Eagles, Quick 1888, Arnhemse Boys and VV Rheden. However, the tension between the local sides lessened as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the local clubs.

===Retired numbers===
===Youth teams===
The club is famous, however, for its Youth Academy, which is rated with the maximum of 4 Stars by the KNVB. Many players in professional football in Europe have played at Vitesse in the past including Roy Makaay, Robin Gosens, Ricky van Wolfswinkel, Davy Pröpper, Alexander Büttner, Stijn Schaars, Peter Bosz, Marco van Ginkel, Theo Janssen, Erwin Mulder, Eloy Room, Piet Velthuizen, Martin Laamers, Nicky Hofs and Mitchell van Bergen. All youth teams will train and play their matches at Papendal.

The Vitesse Academy comprises age-group teams ranging from U8&#x27;s up to the flagship U19&#x27;s. The youngest players are scouted at amateur clubs in the direct surroundings of Arnhem. For the age of twelve and older, the academy extends its scouting area, mainly to the remaining part of the Netherlands and Germany. In Vitesse&#x27;s youth system, efficient and qualified training is done by full-time coaches and organized by further employees looking after the administration. The goal of the sporting education is to train the youths from basic to development to performance levels, for them to fulfil the sportive and non sportive demands of professional football.

==Board and staff==
===Corporate hierarchy===
===Management hierarchy===
== Owners ==
After Karel Aalbers left, the financial situation for the club became dire. This downfall almost led Vitesse into bankruptcy in 2008, as they were not able to pay back loans given by their sponsor AFAB Geldservice B.V. Eventually the club arranged a deal that saw AFAB&#x27;s owner, Maasbert Schouten, gain 100% of Vitesse&#x27;s shares. Schouten immediately expressed his intent to sell the club, which opened the window for Merab Jordania to buy Vitesse. When Jordania, a former Dinamo Tbilisi player and owner, bought the team in 2010, Vitesse became the first Dutch club in history with a foreign owner. In 2013, Russian businessman Alexander Tsjigirinski bought the club from Jordania. In May 2018 a new acquisition took place at Vitesse. Valeriy Oyf became the new majority shareholder of Vitesse. The Russian oligarch, who was part of the Board of Directors of Vitesse from 2016, took over the shares of Tsjigirinski.

A consortium of five new owners (Dane Murphy, Flint Reilly, Timo Braasch, Leon Müller, and Bryan Mornaghi) acquired Vitesse, assuming its €17 million debt from creditor Coley Parry, who had stepped in after the club&#x27;s previous Russian owner, Valery Oyf, sought a sale following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Chairmen==
The first chairman was Frans Dezentjé. Willem Hesselink was chairman of the club from 1917 to 1922 and was appointed honorary chairman in 1962. Although Vitesse&#x27;s coaches have come from all over Europe, the club&#x27;s chairmen have been mostly Dutch, with Merab Jordania and Yevgeny Merkel as the only exceptions. The name of Karel Aalbers is inseparably linked to Vitesse. Although a club&#x27;s success is never the work of a single man, nonetheless, the former chairman&#x27;s part in the sportive and professional growth of Vitesse may be labelled as truly exceptional. Karel Aalbers handled the chairman&#x27;s gavel from 1984 to 2000.

The professional section was renamed SBV (Stichting Betaald Voetbal – &quot;Professional Football Foundation&quot;) Vitesse whilst the amateur section became &quot;(AVC) Vitesse 1892&quot;, who played their home matches at the Sportcomplex Valkenhuizen. In total, the club has won five trophies; one Derde Klasse title, one Vierde Klasse title, one Zesde Klasse title and two Arnhem Cups. In 2009, Vitesse 1892 was declared bankrupt. The amateur section has produced a number of professional players including Andy van der Meijde, Nicky Hofs, Léon Hese, Erwin van de Looi and Theo Janssen.

===Vitesse Legends===

Vitesse Legends are a beneficiary team that was initiated by Ben Snelders, Leo de Kleermaeker and Dik Herberts in the 1990s, competing in at least one match a year, usually in the name of charity and/or to bid farewell to retiring former Vitesse players. The team is made up of various members of the Club van 100 of Vitesse who will come out of retirement for this match to face the current Vitesse squad. Past participants have included Theo Janssen, Marc van Hintum, Edward Sturing, Ruud Knol, Remco van der Schaaf, Nicky Hofs, Erwin van de Looi, Glenn Helder, Philip Cocu, John van den Brom, Theo Bos, Martin Laamers, Michael Dingsdag, Roberto Straal, Frans Thijssen, Dejan Čurović, Jhon van Beukering and Huub Loeffen.

==National team players==

A number of Vitesse players have represented the Netherlands national team, the first official international being Willem Hesselink. He was one of the founders of Vitesse in 1892 at age 14. In 1905 he started in the first ever home match of the Netherlands national football team, a 4–0 victory against Belgium. Some historians attribute one of the goals scored to him. Just Göbel played 22 matches for the Dutch team, being best remembered for his numerous saves during the 2–1 win over England&#x27;s amateurs and his bronze medal in the football tournament of the 1912 Summer Olympics. The record number of Vitesse players for the Netherlands was three, which occurred on two occasions in 1989. The following players were called up to represent the Netherlands national team in international football and received caps during their tenure with Vitesse:

<text>Willem II Tilburg (), commonly known simply as Willem II, is a Dutch football club based in Tilburg, Netherlands. They play in the Eredivisie, the top tier of Dutch football, following promotion from the Eerste Divisie in the 2023–24 season. The club was founded on 12 August 1896 as &quot;Tilburgia&quot;. On 12 January 1898, the club was renamed &quot;Willem II&quot; after Dutch king William II (1792–1849), who, as Prince of Orange and commander of the Dutch army, had his military headquarters in Tilburg during the Belgian uprising of 1830, spent much time in the city after becoming king, and died there.

Notable former players for the club include Dutch internationals Jan van Roessel, Joris Mathijsen, Jaap Stam, Frenkie de Jong, Marc Overmars, Virgil Van Dijk and Finland&#x27;s Sami Hyypiä. The club&#x27;s shirt consists of red-white-blue vertical stripes, inspired by the colours of the flag of the Netherlands. Willem II plays its home matches in the Koning Willem II Stadion, also named after the King. The stadium, opened on 31 May 1995, has a capacity of 14,700 spectators. The average attendance in 2004–05 was 12,500 people.

The club has won the Eredivisie three times, and the Eerste Divisie four times.

==History==
Established on 12 August 1896 in Tilburg as Tilburgia, the club first played at the Gemeentelijk Sportpark Tilburg and in 1995 relocated to the Koning Willem II Stadion, the ground where they have played ever since. Willem were champions of the Eredivisie in 1916, 1952 and 1955. The Tricolores also won two KNVB Cups in 1944 and 1963 and were also crowned champs of the Eerste Divisie in 1958, 1965 and 2014.
With regard to European competition, Willem II first appeared in UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup of 1963 where they lost to Manchester United in the first round by an aggregate score of 7–2. In 1998–99, Willem once again competed in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and after beating Dinamo Tbilisi of Georgia 6–0 in both legs, Willem then lost to Spanish side Real Betis in the second round, 4–1 on aggregate. A second place in the Eredivisie of 1999 guaranteed the club a UEFA Champions League berth for the first time. At the tournament&#x27;s group stage, Willem only attained two points in their six group G matches and were thus eliminated. After reaching the KNVB Cup final in 2005 where they lost 4–0 against PSV Eindhoven, Willem II again qualified again for the UEFA Cup, in which they lost to French side AS Monaco in the first round by 5–1 on aggregate.

At the end of the 2010–11 season, Willem II were relegated from the Eredivisie for the first time in 24 years. In the 2011–12 season under new manager Jurgen Streppel Willem II was promoted back to the Eredivisie, but they went right back down the next season after finishing bottom of the table. The club became champions of the Eerste Divisie in the subsequent season and were thus promoted back to the Eredivisie.

In early 2015, journalists at &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; revealed that Willem II had its matches fixed by an &quot;Asian gambling syndicate&quot;, who had paid Willem&#x27;s players a total sum of €100,000 to lose matches against Ajax and Feyenoord (in October and December 2009). According to the journalists, midfielder Ibrahim Kargbo was the Asians&#x27; main contact within the club; Kargbo denies having accepted their money. The Royal Dutch Football Association called the affair &quot;the most concrete case of match fixing in the Netherlands&quot; and took legal action as well as asking UEFA and FIFA to reevaluate previous matches.

In 2019, Willem II reached the KNVB Cup final for the fourth time in their history. They beat AZ Alkmaar in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out, but were heavily beaten by in the final by Ajax.

The fans of Willem II have close links with the fans of English championship club Bristol City. Willem supporters have been known to travel to Bristol, with Bristol City fans heading the other way to Tilburg. At Bristol City&#x27;s game on 31 October 2009 against Sheffield Wednesday, some Willem II fans were seen in the &#x27;Eastend&#x27; of the Ashton Gate Stadium, and songs were sung about Willem II by City fans. On the 3rd of August 2024, the teams played each other for the first time in a pre-season friendly at Ashton Gate stadium in Bristol.

==Rivalries==
Willem II longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their neighbour, NAC Breda. This rivalry originated in the 1920s. Matches between the two are referred to as the derby of Brabant. The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that it is city against city with local pride at stake.

<text>Augustus Willington Shelton Agar, (4 January 1890 – 30 December 1968) was a Royal Navy officer in both the First and the Second World Wars. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for sinking a Soviet cruiser during the Russian Civil War.

In his naval biography, &quot;Footprints in the Sea&quot;, published in 1961, Agar described himself as &quot;highly strung and imaginative.&quot; The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that Agar &quot;epitomizes the &#x27;sea dog&#x27; of British naval tradition: honourable, extremely brave and totally dedicated to King, country and the Royal Navy.&quot;

==Early life==
Augustus Agar was born in Kandy, Ceylon, on 4 January 1890. He was the thirteenth child of John Shelton Agar/Eagar, an Irishman from Milltown, County Kerry, who had left his native land in 1860 to become a successful tea planter in Ceylon. John&#x27;s cousin Honora Eagar was the first wife of Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa, an Irish Fenian leader and member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Agar was brought up in comfortable circumstances in a fine house with servants. Agar&#x27;s mother, who was Austrian, died shortly after his birth, and at the age of eight he was sent with one of his brothers to school in England. All his brothers were educated in English public schools, and all his sisters were educated in Austrian or German schools. His father died in 1902 of cholera which he had caught during a visit to China.

Augustus (&quot;Gus&quot;) Agar attended Framlingham College in Suffolk. He was now without parents or a fixed home and his oldest brother, Shelton, determined that he should go into the Navy. Gus, who idolized his older brother, willingly agreed. To prepare, he attended Eastman&#x27;s Royal Naval Academy in Southsea.

A friend of the family, Captain Henry Jackson, later First Sea Lord and an Admiral of the Fleet, nominated Agar for a place in the annual intake of naval cadets. After time spent with a &quot;crammer&quot;, he passed the entrance exams and in 1904 joined the naval cadet school, HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, at Dartmouth. The &quot;Britannia&quot; was a wooden man of war, obsolete when launched in 1860, and soon tied up and used as a stationary training ship.

As a part of his training, Agar went to sea in a 5,650 ton second class cruiser, , and afterwards on the slightly older HMS &quot;Isis&quot;. These ships were stationed at Bermuda and many classes were held ashore when the ships were in port. Agar had many pleasant memories of sports, swimming, boating and picnics during this period.

Agar served at sea in a number of ships in the prewar period, including the battleships attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, and , commanded by Captain (later Admiral) David Beatty. He greatly admired Beatty&#x27;s dash and style.

Agar&#x27;s early training gave him a thorough grounding in basic naval matters, especially in handling small boats. This was to prove a great asset later in his career. In 1910 Agar passed his seamanship examination with flying colours and was made an acting sub-lieutenant. During 1911, he served aboard a destroyer, . He spent the next period on course at Portsmouth and studying at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 June 1912.

After his courses were complete, Agar was assigned to small ships, his first being &quot;Torpedo Boat No. 23&quot;. In April 1913 he was sent to learn to fly. It was not entirely his &quot;métier&quot;, though he obtained his licence after enduring three crashes in the very primitive aircraft of the time. He joined the pre-dreadnought battleship in September 1913, attached to the Home Fleet.

==First World War==

===The Grand Fleet===
Agar was aboard &quot;Hibernia&quot; when the First World War broke out in August 1914, and soon sailed with her to Britain&#x27;s wartime base at Scapa Flow. He was a part of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe&#x27;s Grand Fleet.

As newer and faster dreadnoughts joined the fleet, the pre-dreadnoughts became increasingly obsolete, being slower, with much less firepower and poor design features.

===The Dardanelles and guard duty===
In the summer of 1915 it was decided to send &quot;Hibernia&quot; out to the Dardanelles to provide gunnery support to the Allied landings on the Gallipoli peninsula. She arrived in September 1915 at the Royal Navy base at Mudros on the Greek island of Lemnos at the entrance to the straits leading to the Black Sea.

The sheltered waters of the Aegean Sea and the straits enabled &quot;Hibernia&quot; to use all her guns and she was employed in firing at Turkish targets on Gallipoli and the nearby Asia Minor shore. She was hit once by a Turkish shell, but not seriously damaged.

&quot;Hibernia&quot; returned to Britain when the Allies evacuated Gallipoli and was stationed at Rosyth with others of her class to guard against raids on the British coast by German ships. Because of their slow speed and weak offensive power, the pre-dreadnought battleships were not ordered to join the Grand Fleet for the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, though they got up steam pending the outcome of the engagement.

===North Russia===
After Jutland the battleship threat from Germany receded somewhat and the danger from mines and submarines grew. Especially vulnerable were the two ports of Murmansk and Archangel in North Russia used by British merchant ships taking materiel to their ally. Mine-sweeping naval trawlers were sent to counter this threat, and two old cruisers were modified to act as repair workshops and headquarters for this flotilla. Agar joined one of them, , as executive officer in December 1916. The &quot;Iphigenia&quot; dated from 1892, displaced 3,400 tons and in her early days could make 20 knots.

&quot;Iphigenia&quot; arrived at Murmansk in March 1917, just as the Russian Revolution was beginning. She operated out of Archangel in the summer when the White Sea was clear, and from the ice free Murmansk in the winter. Although it was apparent to local Allied commanders that the materiel landed after the spring of 1917 was not being put to good use, their advice to stop the flow was ignored by Whitehall. Indeed, much of the materiel was either destroyed or ended up being used by the Bolsheviks or the Germans.

While at Murmansk, Agar had the opportunity to renew acquaintance with Russian officer friends from the cruiser , which was berthed alongside. He had served with them in the Dardanelles when he was on HMS &quot;Hibernia&quot;. He met them again at the Devonport dockyard. However, mutiny soon broke out on the &quot;Askold&quot;, and Agar was shocked to see his officer friends arrested one by one and taken ashore, not to be seen again. Discipline aboard the ship broke down completely and, after the last of the food and supplies were consumed, she was abandoned to rust away.

This difficult and occasionally dangerous mission occupied the &quot;Iphigenia&quot; until the end of February 1918, when worsening conditions and a hostile Bolshevik government prompted a withdrawal. The British were able to take away with them a number of Russians fleeing the Bolsheviks.

The Russian experience was of value to Agar later in his career.

===Coastal motor boats===
Agar served in the Coastal Motor Boats (CMBs) in home waters during the latter part of the war. These small vessels displaced just 5 tons, compared to the 1,110 tons of a First World War era destroyer. Their main offensive weapon was a torpedo. They were of shallow draught and could operate close inshore.

The CMBs carried one or two torpedoes, depending on whether they were &quot;forty footers&quot; or &quot;fifty-five footers&quot;. Mines could be substituted for torpedoes and they also carried depth charges and Lewis guns. It was planned that they be either towed or carried into battle on the German controlled coast by the light cruisers and destroyers of Commodore Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt&#x27;s Harwich Force. With their shallow draught they could skim over the mines and attack the German patrol craft around Heligoland. As 1918 wore on a more ambitious scheme matured to send the CMBs in over the shallow coastal waters to attack the German fleet at its anchorage. However, the Armistice occurred on 11 November 1918 before these plans could be put into effect.

It was as a torpedo and mining officer that Augustus Agar was selected for this service. He participated in the famous raid on Zeebrugge led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes, CMBs being used to lay smoke screens outside the mole to cover the escape of the crews of the blockships. During the summer of 1918, he was stationed at Dover and at Dunkirk, where the CMBs attacked German patrol craft along the Belgian coast.

==Russian Civil War==

The end of the war found him at the CMB base at Osea Island in Essex, England. He was asked in late 1918 by Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming, head of the foreign section of the British Secret Intelligence Service, to volunteer for a mission in the Baltic Sea, where CMBs were to be used to ferry British agents back and forth from Bolshevik Russia. The shallow draught and high speed of the CMB made it ideal for landing on enemy occupied shores and making a quick getaway. Agar and his two boats were technically under the command of the Foreign Office (specifically Captain Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming head of MI6).

Agar set up a small base at Terijoki, just inside Finland and close to the Soviet frontier. From here he undertook a top secret and dangerous mission to retrieve Paul Dukes, a man he knew only by the MI6 codename ST-25, from the coast of the Bay of Petrograd. The last British agent left in Russia, Dukes had been infiltrating the Bolshevik government for some time and had made copies of top secret documents. A master of disguise, he was known as &quot;The Man with A Hundred Faces&quot;, but his resources had run out by this time. In order to spirit Dukes away, Agar&#x27;s boats had to cross Bolshevik minefields and pass by a number of forts and ships guarding the entrance to the Bolshevik naval base at Kronstadt and to Petrograd, now St. Petersburg.

Also operating in the eastern Baltic Sea was a Royal Navy detachment of light cruisers and destroyers under Admiral Sir Walter Cowan. Though technically not connected, Agar regularly reported to Cowan and received assistance from him. Cowan&#x27;s mission was to keep the sea lanes open to the newly independent Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, which were under threat of being overrun by Soviet Russia.

On their missions Agar and his crews dressed in civilian clothes to maintain the fiction that Britain was not involved. They had a uniform on board in case they were in danger of capture. Without the uniform, they could be shot as spies.

Agar felt that his small force should be doing more than acting as a shuttle service. The Bolsheviks had seized much of the Russian fleet at Kronstadt, and Agar considered these vessels a menace to British operations and took it upon himself to attack the enemy battleships.

He set out with his two boats, HM &quot;Coastal Motor Boat 4&quot; and another, on 17 June 1919. One had to turn back before completing its mission, but Agar continued into the bay. The battleships were not in the harbour though. &quot;CMB4&quot; penetrated a destroyer screen and was closing on a larger warship further inshore when &quot;CMB4&quot;, whose hull had been damaged by gunfire, broke down. She had to be taken alongside a breakwater for repairs and for twenty minutes was in full view of the enemy. The attack was then resumed and a Russian cruiser, the 6,645 ton was sunk, after which Agar retired to the safety of the open bay under heavy fire. For this he was awarded the Victoria Cross on 22 August.

Realizing the utility of the CMBs, Cowan ordered more to be sent out from England to add to his fleet.

On 18 August 1919, Agar took his remaining boat against the Soviets, acting as guide-ship to a flotilla of six others, leading them through the minefields and past the forts. Agar&#x27;s boat was ordered to stay outside the harbour, and the attack was led by Commander Claude Dobson. They entered Kronstadt harbour, this time damaging two battleships, 17,400 ton pre-dreadnought and dreadnought and sinking a submarine depot ship, the 6,734 ton .

Paul Dukes, meanwhile, thinking Agar dead because of his failure to appear at their rendezvous point, resolved to leave Petrograd by land and was forced to jump from tram to tram in the city to shake off Cheka agents. After a series of extraordinary adventures through war-torn Latvia under a variety of disguises, he got back to London with his secret documents copied onto tissue paper. He was subsequently knighted by King George V, and remains the only man to be knighted based entirely on his exploits as a spy.

For his part in the Kronstadt action, Agar was awarded the DSO. Dobson and another officer Gordon Steele received Victoria Crosses.

The British naval presence in the Baltic Sea was crucial to securing the independence of Estonia and Latvia.

==Between the wars==
Immediately following his Baltic experiences, Agar returned to Osea Island. On 20 July 1920 he married Mary Petre, 19th Baroness Furnivall.

Agar held a number of seagoing commands between the wars. His first, in June 1920 was as executive officer aboard , a 5,400 ton light cruiser assigned to the newly formed New Zealand Naval Forces, later known as the New Zealand Division (then still part of the Royal Navy). In 1922 he was given command of , an obsolete cruiser of 2,575 tons used as a training ship for the New Zealand Division. These were very happy years for Agar, in a friendly country with interesting work and regular cruises through the South Seas.

On 1 January 1924, at the request of King George V, Agar was appointed captain of the Royal Yacht , another pleasant duty. He served until January 1925.

A great professional assignment in April 1926 was command of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. The commander in chief, Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, specifically asked for Agar. Keyes was an outstanding leader and brought the fleet to the height of its efficiency. The flotilla consisted of four ships, and Agar commanded the flotilla leader until July 1927.

By the late 1920s, Agar and his wife were living apart; they divorced in 1931. This probably had an adverse effect on his chances for promotion, keeping him from reaching flag rank.

After these assignments, Agar was sent on courses and on shore duty for several years, including a stint as naval advisor to the New Zealand Delegation to the London Naval Conference 1930.

On 30 September 1930, Agar was placed in command of the sloop attached to the North America and West Indies Squadron. During this time he married Ina Margaret Lindner in Bermuda, a union which lasted the rest of his life. He served aboard &quot;Scarborough&quot; until September 1932.

Other seagoing commands followed, first in early 1936 aboard the 4,190 ton anti-aircraft cruiser , part of the Reserve Fleet at the Nore. Then, from 15 January 1937 he commanded his favourite ship, the 7,300-ton light cruiser , which, along with her sister, , was the fastest ship in the Royal Navy at 35 knots.

&quot;Emerald&quot; was attached to the East India Station from January 1937 to July 1938. Agar then served as captain of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, England, but with war in the offing he was returned to command of the &quot;Emerald&quot; in the summer of 1939.

==Second World War==

===HMS &quot;Emerald&quot;, gold ingots and the North Atlantic convoys===
When war began on 3 September 1939 Agar was in command of the &quot;Emerald&quot; and, as in 1914, was directed to Scapa Flow. His ship was soon ordered onto the &quot;Northern Patrol&quot;, between the Faroe Islands and Iceland, to intercept any German merchant ships trying to return to their homeland. A second duty was to stop neutral ships and check for contraband headed for Germany. &quot;Emerald&quot; had just returned to Scapa on 1 October 1939 when Agar received &quot;Top Secret&quot; orders to proceed &quot;with all despatch&quot; to Plymouth, England.

On 3 October, &quot;Emerald&quot; dropped anchor in Plymouth. A short time later Agar was being briefed by Rear Admiral Lancelot Holland on his mission. The written instructions were:
On 7 October 1939, &quot;Emerald&quot; sailed from Plymouth, England for Halifax, Nova Scotia with the gold bullion from the Bank of England bound for Montreal, Quebec, Canada to be used to pay for American war materials. This voyage was a component of Operation Fish, the transfer of British wealth to Canada, and was under the strictest secrecy, with the crew were outfitted with tropical whites to confuse German agents. In the company of the two old battleships, and , her sister ship, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and the old cruiser , she ran into some of the heaviest seas that Agar encountered. By the time they reached Halifax the &quot;Emerald&quot; had lost her ship&#x27;s boats, rafts and various depth charges, wires, shackles and other valuable equipment, not to mention her spotter plane, a Fairey Seafox.

Upon arrival in Halifax, &quot;Emerald&quot; was assigned to North Atlantic convoy escort duty for the return voyage. The large convoy was filled with American munitions for the war effort. Since the &quot;Emerald&quot; had been designed and equipped for work in gentler climates this was very uncomfortable as well as dangerous duty. The Canadian Red Cross provided a large supply of warm gloves, woolen scarves, sea boot stockings, leather headgear lined with wool and fur, and woolen underwear, for the crew were ill-equipped to face winter storms with their tropical gear. The convoy lost two merchant ships to U-boats on the trip to the United Kingdom.

Among the convoys &quot;Emerald&quot; escorted was the first Canadian troop convoy, in November 1939, when 7,500 troops reached Britain without incident. Convoy duty continued through the bitter winter of 1939/40. Agar&#x27;s tour of duty as captain of the &quot;Emerald&quot; was completed in June 1940 after escorting a contingent of Canadian soldiers in the SS &quot;Empress of Australia&quot; to occupy Iceland. In the Clyde he handed over command of his beloved ship and departed with the cheers of his officers and crew ringing in his ears. He was then assigned to command the destroyer leader as head of the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich. It was the first assignment in six months on temporary duty.

===Operation Lucid===
Agar was in charge of the planning and execution of Operation Lucid in September 1940, an attempt to hit the German wooden invasion barges at Boulogne and Calais, France, with incendiary material and set them alight. It was a desperate time and any measure, however risky, that could frustrate the German invasion plans was welcome. The plan had the personal backing of Winston Churchill.

Accompanied by various auxiliary vessels, Agar set off for Boulogne several times in September and October 1940 with four small ancient oil tankers filled with a special incendiary fuel (called &quot;Agar&#x27;s special mixture&quot;). The wartime need for oil tankers was so great that only vessels unfit for convoy work were available to Agar. The very poor mechanical condition of these ships hampered the enterprise. Bad weather or mechanical breakdowns forced cancellation of the first attempts.

The last attempt seemed set to be successful until the command ship with Agar aboard, , a Hunt class destroyer, hit an acoustic mine mid-Channel and was severely damaged. She had to be towed back to England, being shelled by German coastal batteries on the French coast on the way back, but without receiving a hit.

The season was now too late for another attempt and, in any case, the threat of invasion had receded.

===Coastal Forces===
On 25 November 1940, Agar was appointed chief staff officer to the rear admiral commanding Coastal Forces. This was a critical position as the Germans were vigorously attacking the coastal convoys running down the English Channel and up and down the east coast from Scotland to the northeast of England down to London. The threats were from aircraft, mines and fast German motor torpedo boats called E-boats. Britain had let her coastal forces deteriorate since the days when Agar had himself commanded CMBs.

One coastal convoy in the fall of 1940 lost fourteen of twenty-five ships between London and Bristol. The toll on the East Coast convoys was just as great, with the threat of E-boats making a quick dash from ports in the Low Countries. The problem was that if coastal convoys were discontinued, the British rail network could not handle the extra traffic and factories would be idle for lack of raw materials. The vessels used in the coastal trade were small and specially designed for the service, and of limited utility on ocean convoys. The traffic in coal from the northeast of England to London was especially important.

Agar worked hard in this role from November 1940 to July 1941 when he was given a new seagoing command.

===HMS &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;===
Agar was appointed captain of the 9,925 ton heavy cruiser in August 1941. The ship carried a catapult operated reconnaissance aircraft (a Supermarine Walrus), had a great range and was designed for finding and destroying enemy commerce raiders. She was assigned to convoy protection duty in the South Atlantic and left Scotland on her first mission escorting a slow convoy to South Africa with a stop en route at Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Based at Freetown, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; worked with the cruisers and later and . For a while they were joined by the aircraft carrier . Their task was to protect Allied commerce in the South Atlantic from German surface raiders and submarines. Particular targets of the British cruisers were the supply ships which replenished German submarines and surface raiders. Without them the submarines would have to withdraw. The &quot;Devonshire&quot; sank the German commerce raider on 22 November 1941.

On 1 December 1941 &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; came upon the German supply ship &quot;Python&quot;, which immediately attempted to flee. Since the area was one where merchant ships seldom ventured, Agar fired two salvos at the ship, one before and one behind as a warning to stand to. At this the &quot;Python&quot; scuttled herself. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; did not stop to pick up survivors as she knew that submarines were likely to be near.

One of the German U-boats heading to the &quot;Python&quot; to be refuelled spotted HMS &quot;Dunedin&quot; and sank her. Only four officers and 63 men survived out of &quot;Dunedin&quot;&#x27;s crew of 486 officers and men.

===Japanese in the Indian Ocean===
&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was berthed at the naval base at Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa, on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and, soon after, British positions at Hong Kong, Shanghai and Malaya. She was immediately assigned to escort a convoy of British troops just arriving from Halifax in American transports, originally destined for the Middle East, but now diverted to Singapore. She guided them to Bombay and then returned to Durban to escort another convoy to Aden and Bombay. This was essential duty as these convoys were now vulnerable to attack by both German and Japanese raiders, passing by the less than friendly Vichy French island of Madagascar. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; then was assigned to escort a convoy to withdraw as many civilians from Singapore as possible before the island was overrun by the Japanese. She got them safely to Colombo, Ceylon.

Agar then was assigned a mission to transport and land a party of 100 Royal Marines in Burma to harass invading Japanese forces, giving the main forces time to evacuate Rangoon. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; then escorted the last convoy to get out of Rangoon before it fell on 8 March 1942.

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was not equipped to operate in an area with enemy aircraft and Agar was attempting to add anti-aircraft guns in Colombo and to dismantle and refit her engines and boilers to meet the challenges ahead when word arrived that an enemy fleet had entered the Indian Ocean. For an account of the Japanese attack on British positions in the Bay of Bengal see Indian Ocean raid. He stopped his refit, reassembled his machinery and put to sea as fast as he could. Acting on information that the Japanese fleet had turned back, Admiral Somerville ordered &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; back into Colombo to finish the refit. Agar again began to dismantle his machinery and clean his boilers. He was told by the port admiral that anti-aircraft guns would arrive in two days for his ship. It was a Saturday, 4 April, the day before Easter.

The &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was part of a scratch fleet of obsolete British battleships with two small obsolete aircraft carriers and attached cruisers hurriedly put together to stem the Japanese naval advance into the Indian Ocean. Admiral James Somerville had moved the main part of the fleet to a secret base at Addu Atoll in the Maldives, as he knew that his fleet was no match for the Japanese. His main duty was to keep the sea lanes open to India, to the Persian Gulf oilfields and to the Eighth Army in Egypt, at that time attempting to stop the German and Italian armies under General Erwin Rommel.

===End of the Dorsetshire===
&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was in some ways a victim of the lack of British intelligence about the capabilities of the Japanese fleet. Neither Agar nor Somerville had any idea that the range of Japanese naval dive bombers was almost twice that of comparable British aircraft. To survive after getting a second warning of the presence of a large westbound Japanese Fleet in the Indian Ocean he would have had to leave Colombo as fast as possible and head west at top speed.

On Saturday afternoon, 4 April 1942 an urgent message summoned Agar to the base Operations Room in Colombo. A Consolidated Catalina flying boat had just reported that it was shadowing a large force of enemy carriers accompanied by battleships steering west from the Malacca Straits, directly for Ceylon. This was the fleet of Admiral Nagumo.

Admiral Somerville was in the Maldives beyond the immediate reach of the advancing Japanese. Upon receiving the news he moved further out of Nagumo&#x27;s way and ordered the &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and , which was also in Colombo, to join him with all speed. He left the choosing of a rendezvous point to the admiral commanding in Colombo. It took six long hours to reassemble the ships machinery and get her ready for sea. The two cruisers left Colombo harbour at 10 pm on 4 April. The rendezvous point was approved by Admiral Somerville. It was a fatal error as a more westerly rendezvous point would have saved the two ships. The ships could steam at only 28 knots, the top speed that &quot;Cornwall&quot; could make.

At daybreak, Easter Sunday, 5 April 1942, Agar received a signal that the Japanese Fleet was only 120 miles south of Colombo. They began an attack on the port at 8 am. No further communication was received from Colombo (their radio tower was hit).

At this point, lacking further direction, as Somerville was maintaining radio silence and Colombo was out of action, Agar made a fatal decision. He saw his first duty as rejoining the fleet in the hopes of launching a night attack on the Japanese and opted to continue on southwards to the rendezvous point instead of heading due west out of the danger zone. At 11:30 am a Japanese patrol aircraft spotted them. There were six hours of daylight left. Agar continued on to the rendezvous point. He broke radio silence to tell Somerville of his decision. The rendezvous point was 90 miles away.

The two ships were caught by Japanese dive bombers at 1 pm and the&quot; Dorsetshire&quot; sank eight minutes after the first bomb hit. She went down at 13:50 after being struck by 10 bombs. A total of 234 men were killed and 500, including the Captain, survived in the water until rescue 32 hours later. Only 16 of the men who went into the water died, a testament to crew discipline and the leadership of Agar and the other officers and petty officers. The &quot;Cornwall&quot; was sunk as well.

Agar worked hard to save his crew, picking up the wounded in a whaler, gathering up stragglers and giving good advice. He was reported by survivors as speaking calmly.

A Fairey Swordfish found the men in the water the next afternoon and an hour later the light cruiser and the destroyers and arrived to rescue the survivors. Agar was taken aboard the &quot;Paladin&quot;.

During the engagement Agar had been wounded in the leg by shrapnel. This wound turned septic as a result of being left unattended after the sinking. When the &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; sank, Agar had been dragged down deep and suffered an air embolism while coming up, with serious damage to his lungs (i.e. &#x27;pulmonary barotrauma&#x27;). On the surface he swallowed oil. These injuries affected his fitness for further seagoing duty. He was fifty-two and had completed thirty-seven years of active duty. After a short stay in Bombay where his health took a turn for the worse, he was sent to hospital in South Africa. The leg healed, but lung trouble from the air embolism and from the oil he swallowed stayed with him for the rest of his life. He arrived in Britain on 28 May 1942.

==Later life==
After leave for a month, the less than fit Agar was sent to Belfast to supervise the building and completion of the new aircraft carrier . He worked on this assignment for a period and was placed on the retired list in 1943.

Agar was appointed commodore in 1943 when he once again served as president and captain of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He served in this capacity until 1946 and reverted to his substantive rank of captain.

Agar wrote two noteworthy autobiographical books about his naval career: &quot;Footprints in the Sea&quot; (1959) and &quot;Baltic Episode&quot; (1963). In his retirement he farmed at Alton, Hampshire, England. His farm produced strawberries. His clubs were the Athenaeum and the Royal Yacht Squadron.
==Death==
Augustus Agar died on 30 December 1968 and was buried in Alton Cemetery. His will was probated at 9,580 pounds sterling on 28 March 1969.
==Legacy==
His second wife, Ina, attended HMS &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; reunions after his death.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, along with his telescope. His other medals and various papers are in storage there, including a receipt for gold bullion delivered to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1939.

HM Coastal Motor Boat 4, his boat in the Baltic, is on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford.

==Character and manner==
Augustus Agar was described by Alfred Draper in his book, &quot;Operation Fish&quot;, as a &quot;slim, impeccably-uniformed man with an extremely courteous manner.&quot; He had a reputation for expecting a lot from his men, but looking out for their best interest as well. Arriving in Plymouth on Sunday, 29 October 1939 after a gruelling two months of continuous sea duty in the North Atlantic, he was informed that he had to get his damaged ship ready for sea in six days. He sent his men home for a much needed rest and stayed himself to personally supervise dockyard repairs. He devised a means (drawing on his Murmansk experience in 1917–18) of getting steam heat into the mess decks, so that the men coming from and going onto duty in the cold could get a &quot;warm up&quot;.

<text>Brent Belecki (born December 22, 1977, in Calgary, Alberta) is a former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the Western Hockey League, East Coast Hockey League, Central Hockey League, United Hockey League, and American Hockey League.

In the 1997-1998, as a junior, he won the WHL&#x27;s top goaltender award and the WHL playoff Most Valuable Player award. Belecki backstopped the Portland Winter Hawks to the CHL&#x27;s highest honor, the 1998 Memorial Cup. However, due to his small size (5-9, 175 lbs), Belecki was never drafted by a National Hockey League team.

As a professional, Belecki played for teams including the Miami Matadors, the Huntsville Channel Cats, the Asheville Smoke, the San Antonio Iguanas, the Utah Grizzlies, the Corpus Christi Rayz, the Austin Ice Bats, and the Muskegon Fury.

<doc id="834307" wikidata="Q1143285" url="?curid=834307" title="Streets of Rage (video game)">
<text>Streets of Rage is a 1991 beat &#x27;em up game developed and published by Sega for the Genesis. Players control one of three former police officers turned vigilantes who battle a crime syndicate. &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; establishes many conventions of the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; series, such as two-player cooperative play and an acclaimed techno soundtrack from composer Yuzo Koshiro. It was ported for the Game Gear, Sega CD and Master System and has been rereleased as part of various compilations and on download services.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Streets of Rage&quot; is a beat &#x27;em up featuring aspects of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Final Fight&quot;. Players act as Adam Hunter, Axel Stone, or Blaze Fielding, who save Wood Oak City from being overtaken by a criminal syndicate led by Mr. X. The three traverse eight levels and all have a total of 40 moves, such as headbutts, backslams, and reverse kicks. Surrounding the landscape are weapons that can be used to attack enemies, like knives, glass bottles, pipes, and baseball bats, and food items which increase energy, such as apples and chicken.

As in Sega&#x27;s previous beat &#x27;em up &quot;Golden Axe&quot;, enemies walk onto the screen from both sides as well as occasionally appearing from other locations. Foes include ninjas, punks, and women in bondage, and up to 12 can appear on-screen. The player must defeat each opponent to progress through eight locations, known as rounds. Apart from round 7, there is a boss battle at the end of every round with a disproportionately large enemy. Unlike its sequels, none of the enemies are named within the game (they are named only in the Japanese version&#x27;s manual) and only the bosses have a visible life bar.

Players also have a limited number of special attacks that allow them to call their former comrades, the police and summon a police car which fires explosives, damaging all enemies on-screen. The player is given one special attack per life or per level and power-ups shaped like police cars can sometimes be found to supply additional specials.

==Development==
The working title for &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; was &quot;DSWAT&quot;. This was to signify the idea that it took place in the same universe as &quot;&quot;, an earlier Sega game. The cop car from the ending of &quot;ESWAT&quot; on the Genesis is the same as the support car in this title. Lead designer Noriyoshi Oba broached the idea of doing a street fighting game along the lines of &quot;Final Fight&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; with Yuzo Koshiro. Oba was also influenced by action television shows such as &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;. The game was designed for players to focus on preventing enemies from swarming them, as well as to work with a second player using various cooperative team moves.

===Collections===
A signature title and franchise for Sega during the Mega Drive era, the title was collected often.
*&quot;Mega Games II&quot; (compiled with &quot;Golden Axe&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot;) that was later bundled with the Mega Drive.
*&quot;Sega Classics Arcade Collection&quot; (a Mega CD compilation with the two previously mentioned titles, plus &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot; and &quot;Columns&quot;, also available as in cartridge format for Mega Drive II).

*&quot;Streets of Rage&quot;, along with its two sequels, is included in the Japanese version of the &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, but was omitted from the North American GameCube version to avoid it gaining an E10+ rating, and also from the European GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions for unknown reasons. They were previously available on GameTap until the service shutdown in 2015.

*On 29 May 2018, Sega released &quot;Sega Genesis Classics&quot; (known as &quot;Sega Mega Drive Classics&quot; in PAL regions) which includes &quot;Streets of Rage 1-3&quot;.

==Reception==


The game topped the UK Mega Drive charts upon release. &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; went on to be one of the best-selling Sega games, .

&quot;Streets of Rage&quot; was well received. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; claimed it was &quot;a winner in a category that was lacking on the 16-bit Sega&quot; and &quot;a real version of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; for the Genesis&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s critics were quick to call it the best fighting game of all time, making it superior to all other titles such as &quot;Final Fight&quot;; they highlighted its &quot;superb graphics, terrific interaction&quot;, huge amount of attacks, and two-player mode, and called its music &quot;funkadelic&quot; and better than &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Mega Play&#x27;s four reviewers also called it the best all-time fighting, praising the graphics, soundtrack, and described the gameplay as &quot;street fighting action at its best!&quot;

&quot;MegaTech&quot; magazine review said it had &quot;excellent sprites, backdrops and brilliant music. Add in great gameplay and simultaneous two-player action and you&#x27;ve got an essential buy.&quot; &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at Number 6 in its Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. Reviewing the game in &quot;Sega Arcade Classics&quot; for the Sega CD, Glenn Rubenstein wrote in 1993 it &quot;still holds up well.&quot; &quot;Mega Zone&quot;″s Brian Costelloe magazine cited the music, level backgrounds and boss fights. He called the music the &quot;most hyped&quot; of all-time, its shipyard graphics the best on the consoles. He and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; were amazed by the large size of the boss.

==Legacy==
&quot;Streets of Rage&quot; was followed by three sequels, &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot;, &quot;Streets of Rage 3&quot; and &quot;Streets of Rage 4&quot;. There were plans for two further sequels, one of which was developed by Core Design for the Sega Saturn, but Sega pulled the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; name during development after a disagreement with Core about porting it to rival formats; the game was eventually released as &quot;Fighting Force&quot;. A fourth true game in the series, &quot;Streets of Rage 4&quot;, was developed and released by Lizardcube, Guard Crush Games, and DotEmu on April 30, 2020.

===Comics===
Three six-part comic strip series based upon the games appeared in &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; in the early 1990s (along with several other adaptations of popular Sega franchises). The first two of these were written by Mark Millar, who has since become popular writing &quot;The Authority&quot; for Wildstorm, and &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; and &quot;The Ultimates&quot; for Marvel, while the third (along with a Poster Mag story) was written by Nigel Kitching. Peter Richardson produced the artwork for all nineteen episodes. These three stories are based on &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot; and do not feature Adam. A graphic novel compilation of the original 5-part &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; strip was released as a book called &quot;Streets of Rage: Bad City Fighters&quot; in the UK in 1994.

The first story, entitled simply &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;, appeared in STC #7–12 and involved Axel, Blaze, and Max quitting the highly corrupt police force to do more good as vigilantes, taking down Max&#x27;s ex-partner, the crime lord and martial artist Hawk.

The next serial, &quot;Skates&#x27; Story&quot;, appeared in STC #25–30 and introduced Skates, delinquent stepson of Murphy, a friend of Axel and his team and one of the few honest cops left on the force, who was unwillingly drawn into joining Axel&#x27;s group after his parents were killed by Mr. X.

A special one-off story, called &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, appeared in &quot;Sonic the Poster Mag&quot; #7 and involved the heroes causing a racket by fighting one of the many street gangs in a sleeping neighborhood. The police arrive and arrest the thugs, as well as take the heroes to a junkyard for execution. Along the way, Axel explains why he, Blaze, and Max quit the force to a young rookie officer. At the junkyard, just as the officers are about to shoot Max, the rookie officer unlocks Blaze&#x27;s handcuffs, who proceeds to beat the stuffing out of the cops, with Axel, Skates, and Max following shortly. After the dust clears, the rookie officer says he has seen the true colors of the police force and requests that Axel hit him. Axel does so until Blaze tells him to stop, and they and Max and Skates leave as dawn breaks.

The third and final serial, called &quot;The Only Game In Town&quot;, appeared in STC #41–46 and involved the Syndicate unleashing an army of street gangs on the heroes, with the event turned into a gambling event as Mr. X opened a book based on whether or not the heroes would reach the river without being killed first. This ploy was played against the villain when Blaze bet $20,000 on her team&#x27;s survival at odds of a thousand to one. This third story was notable for revealing that, for his failure, the old Mr. X was the victim of a &quot;swimming accident&quot; and had been replaced with a new one by the Syndicate at the story&#x27;s end. Like many non-Sonic stories in this magazine, the story had a cliff-hanger ending, with the new Mr. X promising that he would &quot;recoup his losses&quot; and kill the heroes.

===Soundtrack===

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was acclaimed, with several soundtrack albums being released. The soundtracks were composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Another musician, Motohiro Kawashima, helped on the second, providing a few tracks, and making even more for the third. Three soundtrack CDs were released in all, each of which now sell for high prices at auction and in Japanese markets.

The game’s main theme samples the drum beat from ‘Sadeness (Part I)’ by Enigma.

When the first game&#x27;s development began in 1990, Koshiro was influenced by electronic dance music, specifically house and techno, and wanted to be among the first to introduce those sounds in video games. The soundtrack shows the influence of contemporary R&amp;B and hip hop music. Koshiro said &quot;the most important element in recreating club music sounds for the games was to emulate the timbre and percussion sounds of Roland&#x27;s rhythm machines&quot; (the most famous models being the TR-606, TR-707, TR-808, and TR-909), stating &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t be an exaggeration to say that that sound defined the genre.&quot;

===Animation===
In 2014, Sega formed the production company Stories International and teamed up with film producer Evan Cholfin for animated projects based on its games, with &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; one of them.

<text>Modern Two, formerly the Dean Gallery, in Edinburgh, is one of the two buildings housing the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, one of Scotland&#x27;s national art galleries. It is operated by National Galleries Scotland. It is twinned with Modern One which lies on the opposite side of Belford Road.

==History==

In 1727, Andrew Gairdner, an Edinburgh merchant, founded an Institution for the benefit of orphans. In 1734 a collection was made on behalf of the Institution which raised a sum of money which enabled the feuing of an area of ground at &#x27;The Dingwall Park&#x27; adjoining the Trinity College Kirk, in the valley between the Netherbow and the Calton Hill in Edinburgh. In the same year, William Adam prepared a plan for an Orphan Hospital and the foundation stone was laid. Children were moved in the following year.
At that time the location was largely undeveloped but over the years various developments such as a slaughterhouse and the North Bridge had encroached. Also, the physical condition of the Hospital had deteriorated. It was realised that this situation was affecting the health of the children and the decision was made in1828 to feu part of the lands of Dean conveniently located just to the west of the city, on higher ground above the Water of Leith Village (later the Dean Village). Plans for the replacement Orphan Hospital were drawn up by Thomas Hamilton with an original contract cost of £11,849 and the new Hospital was erected between 1831 and 1833. The managers of the Hospital endeavoured to balance the need to secure a suitable building in keeping with its elevated location at a reasonable cost but which did not resemble a workhouse or prison.

The building, known as the &quot;Dean Orphanage&quot;, which is the subject of a watercolour painting c.1830 by Thomas Hamilton, took three years to build. Built in Craigleith stone from the nearby quarry, it is in English Baroque style with classical detail. The towers over the staircases contain chimneys and contribute to the Edinburgh skyline in the west of the city centre. The clock above the entrance comes from the original Orphan Hospital and in turn from the 1764 demolition of the Netherbow Port on the High Street, which formerly separated the High Street from the Canongate.

The building, which is owned by the City of Edinburgh Council, served as the Dean Education Centre for many decades before conversion to a gallery.

The plot of allotment gardens at the main entrance dates from 1940 when many school grounds were used for such purposes.

===Conversion to gallery===
The conversion of the building into a gallery was designed by the architect Terry Farrell and Partners.

The gallery opened in 1999 opposite the existing Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. In 2011, the buildings were rebranded Modern Two and Modern One, respectively.

==Collection==
Modern Two houses the Paolozzi Gift, a collection of works by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, given by the artist to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1994. The gallery also contains a large collection of Dada and Surrealist art and literature, much of which was given by Gabrielle Keiller. Modern Two also houses temporary exhibitions.

Modern Two is surrounded by a sculpture garden with a number of modern and avant-garde works on display, including &quot;Gate&quot; (1972) by William Turnbull, &quot;Two Lines up Excentric VI&quot; (1977) by George Rickey, &quot;La Vierge d&#x27;Alsace&quot; (1919–1921) by Emile-Antoine Bourdelle, &quot;There will be no Miracles Here&quot; (2007–2009) by Nathan Coley, &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; (1989) by Eduardo Paolozzi, &quot;Two Two-Way Mirrored Parallelograms Joined with One Side Balanced Spiral Welded Mesh&quot; (1996) by Dan Graham, &quot;Macduff Circle&quot; (2002) by Richard Long, and &quot;Escaped Animals&quot; (2002) by Julian Opie.

<text>Real Betis Balompié, known as Real Betis () or just Betis, is a Spanish professional football club based in Seville, Andalusia, Spain. Founded in 1907, it plays in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. It plays home games at the 60,721-seat Estadio Benito Villamarín.

Real Betis won the league title in 1935 and the Copa del Rey in 1977, 2005 and 2022. Given the club&#x27;s tumultuous history and many relegations, its motto is &quot;¡Viva el Betis manque pierda!&quot; ().

==History==
The name &quot;Betis&quot; is derived from &quot;Baetis&quot;, the Roman name for the Guadalquivir river which passes through Seville and which the Roman province there was named after. &quot;Real&quot; (&#x27;Royal&#x27;) was added in 1914 after the club received patronage from King Alfonso XIII.

===Foundation===
Betis&#x27; city rivals Sevilla were the first club in Seville, founded in October 1905, while a second club, &quot;España Balompié&quot; were established in September 1907. &quot;Balompié&quot; translates literally as &quot;football&quot;, as opposed to the most commonly adopted anglicised version, &quot;fútbol&quot;. Balompié was founded by students from the local Polytechnic Academy, and were in operation for one year before being officially recognised (in 1909) as &quot;Sevilla Balompié&quot;; despite this, 1907 remains the official foundation date of the club.

Following an internal split from Sevilla FC, another club was formed, Betis Football Club. In 1914, they merged with Sevilla Balompié. The club received its royal patronage in the same year, and therefore adopted the name Real Betis Balompié. Fans continued to refer to the club as &quot;Balompié&quot; and were themselves known as &quot;Los Balompedistas&quot; until the 1930s, when &quot;Betis&quot; and the adjective &quot;Béticos&quot; became common terminology when discussing the club and its followers.

Real Betis originally played in all blue jerseys and white shorts, for no other reason than the easy availability of such plain colours. However, one of the club&#x27;s founders and team captain, Manuel Ramos Asensio, was keen to take advantage of his relationships made while studying in Scotland, contacted Celtic (whose green and white colours matched the Andalusian regional flag) and obtained the same fabric to make kits for his own club. Ramos had the lines re-orientated from horizontal &#x27;hoops&#x27; into vertical stripes to make the shirts (no other Spanish club used the combination at the time). There is no mention of Celtic or Scotland in the history of Betis on the club&#x27;s official website, but in 2017 the club officially acknowledged the link by producing a special hooped kit to coincide with Andalusia Day. The blue colour is still often used in away kit designs.

===1930s: promotion, championship and relegation===
During the Spanish Second Republic (1931–1939), royal patronage of all organisations was nullified, and thus the club was known as Betis Balompié until after the Spanish Civil War when it would revert to the full name. The club reached the Copa del Presidente de la República final for the first time on 21 June 1931, when it lost 3–1 to Athletic Bilbao in Madrid. Betis marked their 25th anniversary year by winning their first Segunda División title in 1932, finishing two points ahead of Real Oviedo, thus becoming the first club from Andalusia to play in La Liga.

On 28 April 1935, under the guidance of Irish coach Patrick O&#x27;Connell, Betis won La Liga, to date their only top division title. They topped the table by a single point over Madrid FC. A year later Betis went down to seventh. This was due to the dismantling of the championship-winning team because of the club&#x27;s poor economic situation and the arrival of the Civil War, meaning that just 15 months after winning the league title only two players who won in 1935 were left: Peral and Saro. No official league was held during the Civil War between 1936 and 1939, until its resumption for the 1939–40 season and the first year back highlighted Betis&#x27; decline as exactly five years after winning the title the club was relegated.

===Darkest period===
Despite a brief return to the top division which lasted only one season, the club continued to decline and in 1947 an all-time low was reached when the club were relegated to Tercera División. Many fans see the ten years they spent in the category as key to the &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;soul&quot; of the club. During this time, Betis earned a reputation for filling its stadium and having massive support at away matches, known as the &quot;Green March&quot;.

When the side returned to the second level in 1954, it gained the distinction of being the only club in Spain to have won all three major divisions&#x27; titles. Much of the credit for guiding Betis through this dark period and back into the &quot;Segunda&quot; lies with chairman Manuel Ruiz Rodríguez.

===Benito Villamarín===
In 1955, Manuel Ruiz Rodríguez stepped down from running the club believing he could not offer further economic growth, he was replaced by Betis most famous former president, Benito Villamarín. During his reign Betis returned to the top division in 1958–59 and finished in third place in 1964. His purchase of the Estadio Heliópolis in 1961 is seen as a key point in the history of the club – the grounds were called the &quot;Estadio Benito Villamarín&quot; until 1997. In 1965, Villamarín stepped down from his position after ten years at the helm of the club.

Just one year after Villamarín&#x27;s departure, the club would again be relegated to division two, then rising and falling almost consecutively until consolidating their place in the top level in 1974–75.

===First Copa del Rey Title and European Qualification===

On 25 June 1977, Betis played Athletic Bilbao at the Vicente Calderón Stadium in the Copa del Rey final. The match finished 2–2, with Betis winning 8–7 after a staggering 21 penalties taken to win its first ever Copa del Rey title. This rounded off a solid season in which the club finished fifth in the league.

After that triumph, Betis competed in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup: after knocking out Milan 3–2 on aggregate in the first round, the side reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to Dynamo Moscow. Despite their strong performance in Europe, the team suffered league relegation.

The following year, Betis returned to the top flight and ushered in a period of &quot;good times&quot; for the club, with the next three seasons seeing three top-six finishes, as well as UEFA Cup qualification in 1982 and 1984.

During the summer of 1982, the Benito Villamarín hosted two matches as part of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and also witnessed the Spain national team&#x27;s famous 12–1 hammering of Malta to qualify for UEFA Euro 1984.

===Economic crisis and Manuel Ruiz de Lopera===

In 1992, Betis found itself subject to new league rules and regulations due to its restructuring as an autonomous sporting group (SAD), requiring the club to come up with 1,200 million pesetas, roughly double that of all the first and second division teams, despite being in level two at the time.

In just three months, the fans raised 400 million pesetas with then vice-president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stepping in to provide an economic guarantee while himself becoming majority shareholder as the team narrowly avoided relegation.

On 11 September 1994, Real Betis played its 1,000th game in La Liga.

===Serra Ferrer success===
After another three seasons in the second division, with the club managed by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, Betis returned to the top flight for the 1994–95 season, subsequently achieving a final third position, thus qualifying to the UEFA Cup.In the European campaign, Betis knocked out Fenerbahçe (4–1 on aggregate) and 1. FC Kaiserslautern (4–1) before losing to defeated finalists Bordeaux (3–2). In 1997, 20 years after winning the trophy for the first time, the club returned to the final of the Copa del Rey – again held in Madrid, although this time at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium – losing 2–3 against Barcelona after extra time.

Incidentally, &quot;Barça&quot; was the club Serra Ferrer would leave Betis for that summer, to be replaced by former player Luis Aragonés. Aragonés would only last one season with the club, leading the side to the eighth position and to the quarter-finals in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they would lose 2–5 on aggregate to eventual winners Chelsea.

Aragonés was followed by the controversial reign of Javier Clemente, who spat on a fan and implied Andalusia was &quot;another country!&quot;. The team slipped down the table, finishing 11th and being knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Bologna in the third round. For the next couple of seasons, Betis went through numerous managers, a relegation and a promotion, after which the team finished sixth in the league with Juande Ramos at the helm.

Ramos was gone after just one season, however, being replaced by former Cup Winners&#x27; Cup-winning manager Víctor Fernández. He led the team to eighth and ninth in the league and the third round of the 2002–03 UEFA Cup, being knocked out by Auxerre (1–2 on aggregate), during his two-year reign.

For 2004, Fernández was replaced by the returning Serra Ferrer, who guided the team to the fourth position in the top flight. They also returned to the Vicente Calderón on 11 June 2005 for the Copa del Rey final, lifting the trophy for only the second time after an extra-time winner by youth graduate Dani in a 2–1 win against Osasuna.

The league finish meant Betis became the first Andalusian team to compete in the UEFA Champions League, and it reached the group stage after disposing of Monaco in the last qualifying round (3–2 on aggregate). Drawn in Group G, and in spite of a 1–0 home win against Chelsea, the club eventually finished third, being &quot;demoted&quot; to the UEFA Cup, where it would be ousted in the round of 16 by Romanian club Steaua București with a 0–3 home loss. Compared to the previous season, the league campaign was disappointing, with the club finishing in 14th place, just three points off the relegation zone.

===Centenary celebrations===

Betis celebrated their centenary year in 2007. The festivities included a special match against Milan, the reigning European Champions, on August 9, with the hosts winning 1–0 thanks to a Mark González penalty early in the second half. Seven days later, the club won the Ramón de Carranza Trophy held in neighbouring Cádiz, beating Real Zaragoza on penalties in the final, having defeated Real Madrid in the semi-finals.

Surrounding the celebration, it was a time of great change in terms of the playing and technical teams, with eight new signings replacing 14 departures. In the summer of 2006, Serra Ferrer was replaced by Luis Fernandez for the 2006–07 season. However, the two seasons that encompassed the centenary year (2006–07 and 2007–08) were disappointing, with the club having four different managers and barely avoiding relegation in both seasons.

===Relegation===
After many years of staving off relegation, Betis&#x27; 2008–09 season culminated with a 1–1 draw against Real Valladolid at home. As a result, the club finished 18th in the table and consequently was relegated to the second division on goal difference.

On 15 June 2009 over 65,000 &quot;Beticos&quot;, including icons such as Rafael Gordillo, Del Sol, Hipólito Rincón, Julio Cardeñosa and others, joined the protest march in Sevilla with the slogan &quot;15-J Yo Voy Betis&quot; to let the majority owner Ruiz de Lopera know that it was time to put his 54% share of the club on the market for someone, some entity or the Betis supporters to buy those shares and remove Lopera from the day-to-day operations of the club.

Despite the protests, no upper management changes were made during the season, which would ultimately see Betis fail to gain promotion back to the top level.

===Lopera court action and sale===
Seville judge Mercedes Alaya was investigating links between Betis and other Ruiz de Lopera-owned businesses, leading to him being formally charged with fraud. On 7 July 2010, one week before the start of preliminary court proceedings, Lopera sold 94% of the shares that he owned (51% of Betis total shares) to Bitton Sport, fronted by Luis Oliver, for the surprisingly low figure of €16 million, leaving Lopera with only minor shares; Oliver had already reportedly taken two football clubs, Cartagena and Xerez, to the brink of bankruptcy.

Before the sale could be officially sanctioned, however, Ayala froze Lopera shareholdings. Left with nothing, despite putting down a €1 million deposit, Oliver hastily bought a nominal number of shares from a third party and was voted onto the board of directors by the existing members (all former cohorts of Lopera), allowing him to carry on running the club. In response to this, the judge appointed well-respected former Betis, Real Madrid and Spain national team legend Rafael Gordillo to administer Lopera&#x27;s shares to ensure Lopera was not still running the club and that decisions made were for the benefit of the club not individual board members.

===La Liga return===
Again under Pepe Mel, Betis started 2011–12 with four wins in as many games, with Rubén Castro retaining his goal scoring form from the previous season, where he scored 27 goals. Betis finished 13th in their first season since returning to La Liga.

In the 2012–13 season, Betis finished seventh in La Liga and qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, the first European qualification for the club since the 2005–06 Champions League. This European campaign ended in the quarter-finals after losing on penalties to local rivals Sevilla. Betis were relegated from La Liga with three games still to play in the 2013–14 season, but returned immediately as champions with two games to spare.

=== Back into UEFA competitions ===
In the 2017–18 season, under Quique Setién, Betis finished sixth in La Liga and earned a spot in the Europa League. The 2018–19 campaign was very positive; the club reached the Copa del Rey semi-finals and topped their group in the Europa League, before eventually being knocked out by Stade Rennais in the round of 32.

On 9 July 2020, Manuel Pellegrini was appointed as Betis manager ahead of the 2020–21 season. Pellegrini guided Betis to a sixth-place finish and a Europa League spot, an improvement since the previous season (2019–20) which saw Betis finish 15th.

On 23 April 2022 Betis won the Copa del Rey final against Valencia after drawing 1–1 after 120 minutes and winning 5–4 on penalties. It was the first trophy after 17 years, since they won their second Copa del Rey on 2005 against Osasuna (2–1).

The club displayed consistency under Pellegrini&#x27;s management by qualifying for the UEFA Europa League for three consecutive seasons, finishing fifth and sixth in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, respectively. The club qualified for the UEFA Conference League after a seventh-place finish in 2023–24 season.

==Seville derby==
Betis have a long-standing rivalry with city neighbours Sevilla FC. The two have met 114 times in official competition, with Sevilla holding a 45% win ratio over Betis (31%).

The first match between the two clubs took place on 8 February 1915, with Sevilla winning 4–3. The match was not completed, as high tensions led an aggressive crowd to invade the pitch, forcing the referee to abandon the match.

In 1916, the first &quot;Copa Andalucía&quot; was held, this being the first official derby of the Sevilla area. Of the 17 runnings of the cup, Sevilla were victorious 14 times, to Betis&#x27; one sole conquest; this included a 22–0 routing after the latter sent their youth team, in 1918.

The first time the teams met in league, in &quot;Segunda&quot;, happened in 1928–29, with both teams winning their home matches (3–0 and 2–1). They played for the first time in the Spanish top division during the 1934–35 season, with a 0–3 home defeat for Sevilla and a 2–2 draw at Betis, with the latter winning the national championship.

On 17 January 1943, Betis lost 5–0 at Sevilla, eventually being relegated. In the first game held at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, on 21 September 1958, the &quot;Verdiblancos&quot; won it 4–2.

In later years, several matches were also marred by violence, including: a security guard attacked by a Sevilla fan with a crutch (that he did not require to walk), Betis goalkeeper Toni Prats being attacked and Sevilla manager Juande Ramos being struck by a bottle of water; the latter incident led to the 2007 Copa del Rey match being suspended, being played out three weeks later in Getafe with no spectators.

On 7 February 2009 Betis won 2–1 at the Pizjuán, but was eventually relegated from the top flight, while Sevilla finished in third position.

On 9 November 2019 more than 10,000 Betis fans visited the team training before the last derby in 2019.

==Stadium==

Upon Real Betis&#x27; formation, the club played at the Campo del Huerto de Mariana. In 1909, Betis moved to the Campo del Prado de Santa Justa, moving to the Campo del Prado de San Sebastián, sharing the site with rivals Sevilla two years later. In 1918, Real Betis moved to the Campo del Patronato Obrero, with the first game at the ground coming against rivals Sevilla on 1 November 1918, resulting in a 5–1 loss for Real Betis. During the 1920s, the ground was redeveloped numerous times by club president Ignacio Sánchez Mejías. After the construction of the Estadio de la Exposición, the former name of Betis&#x27; current home, in 1929, Real Betis moved into the site officially in 1936, after playing a number of games at the stadium since its construction.

With a 60,720-seat capacity, the Estadio Benito Villamarín is the home ground of Real Betis. It was named &quot;Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera&quot; during the 2000s after the club&#x27;s owner, who decided to build a new stadium over the old one.

Despite much planning, the stadium&#x27;s renovation plans were constantly postponed, and half of it remained unchanged. On 27 October 2010, it returned to its first denomination after a decision by the club&#x27;s associates.

==Colours==

===Evolution===

In its initial years, Sevilla Balompié dressed in blue shirts with white shorts, which represented the infantry at the time. From late 1911, the team had adopted the shirts of Celtic, at that time vertical stripes of green and white, that were brought over from Glasgow by Manuel Asensio Ramos, who had studied in Scotland as a child. On 28 February 2017, on the 37th Andalusia Day, Real Betis wore Celtic-inspired hoops against Málaga CF.

When the team became Real Betis Balompié in 1914, various kits were used, including: yellow and black stripes; green T-shirts and a reversion to the blue top and white shorts uniform. By the end of the 1920s, Betis was once again sporting green and white stripes, around this time the Assembly of Ronda (1918) saw the Andalusian region formally adopt these colours, not being known how much the two are linked.

Since then, this remained Betis&#x27; shirt, despite several versions (including wider stripes).

Together with the basic green-and-white shirt, Betis has wore both black and green shorts in addition to white shorts.

==Controversy==
On the 4th July 2024 a 2 year sponsorship deal with the U.K. based train ticketing company Trainline was announced. This was considered controversial by some due to their links, via the chairman of their board, with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). There have been multiple accusations of rape and sexual misconduct against members of the CBI

<text>The 65th Infantry Division—nicknamed the &quot;Battle-Axe Division&quot;—was an infantry division of the United States Army that served in World War II. Its shoulder patch is a white halberd on a blue shield.

The entire length of Pennsylvania Route 65 is named the &quot;65th Infantry Division Memorial Highway&quot; in its honor.

The home arena for the United States Military Academy at West Point&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams is named Christl Arena in honor of First Lieutenant Edward C. Christl, who served with the division during World War II and was killed in action in Austria on May 4, 1945.

===Initial training===

The 65th Infantry Division was activated on 16 August 1943 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, under the command of Major General Stanley E. Reinhart. As mobilization requirements were outpacing the induction rate, the complete quota of enlisted fillers for the division was not received until the end of the year, delaying the start of basic training until early January 1944. Unit training began on schedule in the spring, but in late May, the division received orders to begin processing infantry privates for shipment as overseas replacements. By July, the 65th Infantry Division had lost about 7,000 men, with officer losses from April to July exceeding one-third, or about 250, particularly lieutenants and captains. When the Army Specialized Training Program was heavily reduced in March 1944, the division was overstrength, so it did not receive any of these high-quality personnel. Replacements for outgoing enlisted men first arrived in May, in the form of 1,100 reassigned Air Corps cadets. In June and July, this was followed by a steady trickle of about 3,000 men from miscellaneous sources such as returns from overseas (about 700), from disbanded antiaircraft and tank destroyer units, and volunteers for the infantry from other branches of the Army. In July, the division sent about 1,000 men aged nineteen or over to overseas replacement depots, from which it received a roughly equal number of eighteen year old graduates of replacement training centers. 

In late July. major withdrawals ended and a program of modified unit retraining was begun, but a steady trickle of men continued to leave; losses in August aggregated 1,173. In late September, the division was alerted for overseas movement to occur in mid-January 1945, a &quot;bombshell,&quot; as no movement had been anticipated before mid-1945. Roughly 1,000 men unqualified for overseas service were dropped, and the division received 2,000 new men in the three months subsequent to being alerted. In mid-October, another startling call came, as movement dates had been pushed up to 13 November for the infantry regiments, with equipment to be packed by 28 October. This disrupted the beginning of modified combined training, but the personnel readiness date was shortly pushed back to 24 December and the equipment date to 10 December. After an abbreviated program of combined training using a large amount of equipment borrowed from other units, the last elements of the division departed Camp Shelby on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1944.

===Combat chronicle===
The 65th Infantry Division landed at Le Havre, France, 21 January 1945, and proceeded to Camp Lucky Strike, where training continued until 1 March, when the division moved forward to relieve the 26th Infantry Division. First elements entered the line, 5 March 1945, and the division as a whole took over aggressive defense of the sector along the Saar, from Orscholz to Wadgassen, on 8 March 1945. On 17 March, the division attacked across the Saar, crossing the river at Dillingen and captured Saarlautern, 19 March, as Siegfried Line defenses cracked. Capturing Neunkirchen, 21 March 1945, the division raced to the Rhine, crossed the river at Oppenheim, 30 March, and ran into heavy German resistance and counterattacks. Langensalza fell on 5 April, Struth on the 7th, and Neumarkt on the 22nd.

Continuing its advance against crumbling German opposition, the division crossed the Danube 4 miles below Regensburg, 26 April, took the city, 27 April, seized Passau, cross the Inn River, 4 May, and occupied Linz, Austria, on the 5th. Germans surrendered en masse. On 9 May, as hostilities officially ended in Europe, the troops of the 65th made contact with the Russians at Erlauf.

<text>Málaga Club de Fútbol (, &quot;Málaga Football Club&quot;), or simply Málaga, is a club based in Málaga, Andalusia, Spain, who compete in Segunda División, the second tier of the Spanish league system, following their promotion from the Primera Federación in the 2023–24 season.

They won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002 and qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup, reaching the quarter-final stages. They also qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, where they were quarter-finalists. Since June 2010, the owner of the club has been Qatari investor Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani.

==History==
===Club Atlético Malagueño===

Málaga&#x27;s history trace back to CD Málaga, a club founded in 1904. &quot;Club Atlético Malagueño&quot; was founded on 25 May 1948 as a former reserve team of CD Málaga, after the club absorbed &quot;CD Santo Tomás&quot; with the purpose of establishing a reserve team, took over as Málaga&#x27;s main team.

&quot;Club Atlético Malagueño&quot; and &quot;CD Málaga&quot; had found themselves together in the 1959–60 Tercera División after &quot;CD Málaga&quot; was relegated at the end of the 1958–59 Segunda División. As a reserve team, the former should have been relegated to regional competition. To avoid this, they separated from their parent club and registered as an independent club within the Royal Spanish Football Federation. That move made it possible for CA Malagueño to survive after CD Málaga suspended operations.

The 1992–93 season saw CA Malagueño playing in Tercera División Group 9. After a successful campaign, the club was promoted to the Segunda División B. The following season, however, the club was relegated again and, facing financial difficulties, were in danger of folding.

===Name change to Málaga CF===
On 19 December 1993, in a referendum, the club&#x27;s members voted in favour of changing names and, on 29 June 1994, CA Malagueño changed their name to Málaga Club de Fútbol S.A.D.

In the early 2000s, Málaga were a club rich in young and top quality players, and boasted a more modern and developed stadium. Although they never pushed for a Champions League place, Málaga were always successful under the popular Joaquín Peiró.

They made a solitary appearance in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002, clinching their only official trophy by beating Gent, Willem II and Villarreal. Málaga&#x27;s run in the UEFA Cup was something of an overachievement, and ended in a defeat on penalties in the quarter-finals to Boavista, after beating Željezničar Sarajevo (who had been eliminated from the Champions League by Newcastle United), Amica Wronki, Leeds United (after a 2–1 win at Elland Road, courtesy of two Julio Dely Valdés goals) and AEK Athens.

After Peiró&#x27;s retirement, a mass exodus slowly started. Darío Silva, Kiki Musampa, Dely Valdés and Pedro Contreras all left the club. Juande Ramos took over as coach and oversaw a 5–1 home thrashing of Barcelona, the club&#x27;s biggest victory against the Catalan giants, with a hat-trick from loanee Salva Ballesta, who would end up missing out on the Pichichi Trophy by just two goals. Ramos, however, left for the Sevilla and Gregorio Manzano took charge.

===Slow decline and financial issues===

Despite steering Málaga to their second consecutive tenth-placed finish, Manzano could not prevent a lackluster side from being relegated, and they finished at the bottom of the league with a paltry 24 points to their name.

Málaga began the new second division season well. However, their form dipped dramatically and for two of the remaining six weeks were in the relegation zone. Málaga managed to address this situation and survived their first Segunda season.

The 2007–08 Segunda División also began impressively, with seven straight victories. Málaga seemed to be on track for promotion but, after another slump in form, they were overtaken as leaders by Numancia. They needed a victory in their final game, at home to Tenerife, to assure promotion. Two goals from Antonio Hidalgo secured a 2–1 triumph and Málaga returned to the top flight as runners-up.

===Abdullah Al Thani era (2010–present)===

Due to the club&#x27;s economic problems, then-president Fernando Sanz found investments at Doha in Qatar to launch an ambitious project, entering in conversations with sheikh Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani. On 11 June 2010, after a week of negotiations, Al Thani became the entity&#x27;s new owner, being named president on 28 July in the members&#x27; meeting.

On 28 June 2010, Jesualdo Ferreira was appointed as coach and Moayad Shatat was appointed as vice president and general manager. Following this was the signing of prominent players like Salomón Rondón and Eliseu. In November, however, Jesualdo was fired because he had not obtained the desired performance, positioning the club in the relegation places. Later, Shatat confirmed Manuel Pellegrini as coach.

With &quot;The Caretaker&quot; in charge, it was decided to discard players of the squad and strengthen with players like centre back Martín Demichelis and midfielder Júlio Baptista. A record five consecutive La Liga wins, alongside a draw against Athletic Bilbao at San Mamés at the start of January 2011, helped the team maintain momentum in the league, finishing the 2010–11 season in 11th place.

In preparation for the 2011–12 season, the club signed with Nike as supplier of the club&#x27;s kits. Málaga also reached a collaboration agreement with UNESCO, which, in addition, became the principal sponsor of the club&#x27;s kit. The more prominent signings of that season were the Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy, the ex-Lyon French midfielder, Jérémy Toulalan, and the most expensive signing in the club&#x27;s history, Santi Cazorla, who arrived from Villarreal in a €21 million deal. Other less prominent players like Isco, former Spanish international midfielder Joaquín and left back Nacho Monreal, were key in the successful season which followed for the Málaga. For the first time in its history, the club qualified for the Champions League after finishing the 2011–12 La Liga campaign in fourth.
In the Champions League, Málaga were paired with Italian giants Milan and reigning Belgian and Russian champions Anderlecht and Zenit Saint Petersburg, respectively. Málaga made it out of the group stage unbeaten, winning their matches against all three clubs. In the round of 16, the team drew Portuguese champions Porto, losing the first away game 1–0 while winning at home 2–0, advancing to the quarter-finals. In a highly anticipated tie against German champions Borussia Dortmund, the home game ended 0–0, leaving &quot;Malagauistas&quot; with a reasonable chance to advance on the back of a draw in the away fixture. In a second leg marked by controversial referee decisions, the scoreboard showed 1–2 at the full 90 minutes mark, seemingly ensuring Málaga&#x27;s place in the semi-finals, but two late goals by Marco Reus (90+1st minute) and Felipe Santana (90+3rd minute) turned the table in favour of the home team. Immediately after the elimination, club president Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani announced a formal complaint would be filed with UEFA and FIFA.

The following season, Málaga was banned by UEFA, along with other clubs for its debts. In a statement the agency declared that the club would be excluded from a subsequent competition, for which it would otherwise qualify, in the next four seasons. However, the ban was eventually downgraded to one season and the club was excluded from the 2013–14 Europa League.

In the summer of 2013, Isco was sold to Real Madrid, Joaquín to Fiorentina and midfielder Jérémy Toulalan to Monaco. The managerial position also changed, with Bernd Schuster taking over from Manuel Pellegrini.

Following 2013, Málaga encountered a steady decline that would result in them finishing in a lower position in the league each year. On 19 April 2018, Málaga faced Levante U.D. hoping to end their run of ten consecutive defeats that left them placed 20th in LaLiga. However, fate took a turn for the worse and Málaga conceded a goal to Levante&#x27;s Emmanuel Boateng in stoppage time to see the final score at 0–1. This loss meant that Málaga would be relegated to the Segunda División, ending a run of ten consecutive seasons in the top flight.

In 2019, Málaga came close to being promoted to La Liga, finishing third in the Segunda División, but was eliminated in the first round of the play-offs by Deportivo de La Coruña. For the 2019–20 Segunda División season, Víctor Sánchez del Amo continued as coach.

In early 2020, reports emerged that club owner Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani and his family who owe Málaga €7.3m in loans and credit lines, were buying out shares from smaller shareholders to be directed to their personal expenses and business interests, yet up to February 2022 no evidence has proven any misconduct to allow the courts to rule that a criminal case is justified. In August 2020, the court appointed administrator issued a statement that he would lay off the entire first-team squad to save the club from oblivion.

In May 2023, Málaga fell into the third tier for the first time since 1998.
In the first season back in Primera Federación, The team ended in 3rd position. Twelve points behind the promoted CD Castellón and seven points behind the 2nd ranked Córdoba CF. In the first round of the play-off they knocked out Celta B 4-3 on aggregate. The final was against Gimnàstic de Tarragona (who had finished 2nd in the regular season). Málaga won the first leg at home 2-1. 
In the second leg, Gimnàstic scored early and forced extra time. After going 2-0 down, the Albiazules scored two goals in the second half of extra time to draw the game 2-2, winning 4-3 on aggregate and winning promotion back to the second tier of Spanish football.

<text>Gutbrod was a German manufacturer of cars, motorcycles and small agricultural machinery. The firm was founded in Ludwigsburg, Germany by Wilhelm Gutbrod in 1926. It originally built &quot;Standard&quot; branded motorcycles. In 1933 the company relocated to the nearby Stuttgart suburb of Feuerbach, and from 1933 to 1935, Standard Superior cars were built with rear-mounted engines.

An updated version of the Gutbrod Superior introduced in 1953 benefited from developments towards fuel injection undertaken by Mercedes-Benz dating initially from 1935: this Gutbrod was the first car in the world to be offered with fuel injection, some three years before fuel injection appeared in a production engine offered by Mercedes themselves.

The small Gutbrod Superior model was produced from 1950 to 1954 using the company&#x27;s own, front-mounted twin-cylinder two-stroke engines initially of 593cc. In April 1953 the engine size was increased to 663 cc for more expensive &#x27;Luxus 700&#x27; versions of the car, while the standard model continued to be offered with the original smaller engine. Claimed power output was for the base version, while for the larger engine or was claimed according to whether fuel feed came via a carburettor or a form of fuel injection. Press reports commended the speed and secure handling of the cars but indicated that the sporty handling came in return for sacrificing some comfort. It was also noted that normal conversation became impossible at speeds above about 80 km/h (50 mph) due to the noise.

7726 cars were produced before the factory was forced to close. The car was developed at the company&#x27;s small factory at Plochingen am Neckar by Technical Director Dr. Hans Scherenberg during the time of Walter Gutbrod who had taken over the firm in 1948 on the death of his father, Wilhelm Gutbrod (26 February 1890 - 9 August 1948). Scherenberg arrived at Gutbrod from Mercedes where the victorious war-time allies had enforced a pause in engine fuel-injection development, and in 1952 he would return to that firm.

A Gutbrod injection engine can still be seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

It was a small two seater car, the overall length was , width and the total weight , max speed . The car was offered as standard version for a price of DM 3990, and as Superior Luxus for DM 4380. Recently, a restoration project of an injection model was sold in Geneva for CHF 3000.

In 1956, the Norwegian Troll car was built on a Gutbrod chassis. pioneering the use of fibreglass in automobile coachwork along with the Chevrolet Corvette as well as some other small scale car manufacturers.

<text>Uriah Atherton Boyden (February 17, 1804 – October 17, 1879) was an American civil and mechanical engineer and inventor from Foxborough, Massachusetts best known for the development of a water turbine, that later became known as the Boyden Turbine around 1844, while working for the Appleton Company in Lowell, Massachusetts. Boyden improved upon a turbine developed by French engineer Fourneyron by adding a conical approach passage for the incoming water—submerged diffusers, guide vanes and a diverting exit passage.

Uriah was also the younger brother of Seth Boyden, also a notable inventor who perfected a process for making patent leather, among other developments.

==Early life==
Uriah Atherton Boyden was born in Foxborough, Massachusetts on February 17, 1804, the son of Seth Boyden and Susannah Atherton. His father was farmer and blacksmith who had invented a machine to split leather.

==Career==
In 1813, Uriah moved to Newark, New Jersey to work in his elder brother Seth&#x27;s leather shop. Around 1828, Uriah returned to Massachusetts where he worked on the early surveys for the Boston and Providence Railroad. He also worked under Loammi Baldwin on the dry dock at the Boston Navy Yard, as other mills in Lowell and the Boston and Lowell Railroad.

While at Lowell, Boyden worked with British-born engineer James B. Francis, who in 1848 developed the Francis turbine, which superseded Boyden&#x27;s earlier invention. However, Boyden-type turbines continued to be manufactured, including those installed at Harmony Mills in Cohoes, New York in the early 1870s, and those used at the first Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant in 1895.

In 1850, Boyden settled in Boston, and devoted himself to the study of chemistry and physics. He never married. He died in Boston on October 17, 1879.

==Legacy==
Upon his death in 1879, Boyden&#x27;s will left about a quarter of a million dollars to a suitable astronomical institution that would build an observatory on a mountain for the better atmospheric seeing conditions than those available at lower altitudes.

His heirs challenged the will, but it was found valid. In 1887, Edward Charles Pickering convinced the trustees of Boyden&#x27;s will to award the Boyden Fund to Harvard College Observatory, of which he was director. Although he initially planned to establish an observatory at Mount Wilson, those plans were abandoned (although the Mount Wilson Observatory was later built by a different group). Instead, needing an observation station for southern hemisphere skies, Harvard College Observatory established the &quot;Boyden Station&quot; at Arequipa, Peru in 1889.

In 1927, Boyden Station was moved to South Africa due to better weather conditions and became known as the Boyden Observatory.

Uriah also contributed to the Boyden Public Library in his hometown of Foxborough, Massachusetts. The National Museum of American History in Washington, DC is home to the Uriah A. Boyden Papers.

==Ancestry==
His maternal ancestors had resided in Lancaster, Massachusetts, having been pioneer settlers to the area. He is a direct descendant of James Atherton, who arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts in the 1630s. The Atherton family ancestry originated from Lancashire, England.

<text>The Standard Superior was an automobile, produced from 1933 to 1935 by &quot;Standard Fahrzeugfabrik&quot; of Ludwigsburg, Germany, founded by motorcycle maker Wilhelm Gutbrod and unrelated to the Standard Motor Company of England. These small cars were designed according to the patents by Josef Ganz and featured rear-mounted two-stroke engines.

After World War II, the same company made Gutbrod cars and introduced the model Gutbrod Superior.

==History==
In the first half of 1932, Wilhelm Gutbrod, the President of the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, came into contact with German engineer Josef Ganz. Ganz had been working on a small car design since the early 1920s and had so far built two prototypes, one for Ardie in 1930 and one for Adler in 1931, called the Maikäfer (May Beetle). After a demonstration with the Maikäfer by Ganz, Gutbrod was most interested in building a small car according to this design. The Standard Fahrzeugfabrik then purchased a license from Ganz to develop and build a small car according to his design. The prototype of this new model, which was to be called Standard Superior, was finished in 1932. It featured a tubular chassis, a rear mid-mounted engine, and an independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear.

==Models==

The first production model of the Standard Superior was introduced at the IAMA (Internationale Automobil- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. It had a transverse 396cc, two-cylinder, two-stroke engine mounted in front of the rear axle. Because of some criticism to the body design, not in the least by Josef Ganz in Motor-Kritik, it was followed in April 1933 by a slightly altered model.

In November 1933 the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik introduced yet another new and improved model for 1934, which was slightly longer with one additional window on each side and had a small seat for children or as luggage space in the back. This car was advertised as the German &quot;Volkswagen&quot; (a term that means, literally, &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot;).

==The Volkswagen Beetle connection==
With the Ardie-Ganz, Adler Maikäfer and Standard Superior cars, as well as his progressive writings and promotion of the concept of a &quot;Volkswagen&quot; (people&#x27;s car) in Motor-Kritik magazine since the 1920s, Josef Ganz is claimed by some to have had input into the Volkswagen Beetle. These cars had some of features of the later Volkswagen Beetle, such as the tubular chassis, rear-mounted engine and independent wheel suspension with swing axles. While the Volkswagen Beetle was produced in its millions after World War Two, the name of Josef Ganz was largely forgotten. In 2004, Dutch journalist Paul Schilperoord started researching the life and work of Josef Ganz, and in 2011 he published &quot;The Extraordinary Life of Josef Ganz: The Jewish Engineer Behind Hitler&#x27;s Volkswagen&quot;.

===Early history===
Brora Rangers were founded in 1879. In 1933 they gained access to membership of the Scottish Football Association and entered the draw for the Scottish Qualifying Cup competition. They were accepted into membership of the Highland Football League in 1962.

They won the North of Scotland Qualifying Cup competition in their centenary year, 1979, when they defeated Peterhead 5–0 on 17 November after a replay at Grant Street Park, Inverness, the teams having played a goal-less draw the previous week.

===History since 2013===
The club won their first ever Highland Football League title in the 2013–14 season after a 3–0 win against Keith on 5 March at Kynoch Park. They are the most northerly club to win the League title to date. They set several postwar Highland League records over the season: most points (95), greatest margin of victory in the league (20 points), highest win rate (31 out of 34), fewest goals conceded (16) and highest positive goal difference (+107). They ended the season with a 19-game unbeaten run which subsequently carried on into the 2014–15 season. With a draw against Fraserburgh in their 38th and final match of the year (across two seasons), Brora achieved the distinction of being unbeaten in league matches for the whole of 2014. Their unbeaten run in the Highland League eventually extended to 57 matches across three seasons, ending with a 3–0 defeat by Cove Rangers on 22 August 2015.

For the 2014–15 season, they started in the second round of the 2014–15 Scottish Cup, and they played for the first time in the 2014–15 Scottish Challenge Cup but lost in the second round to East Fife 3–2. The club retained its Highland League title in the 2014–15 season, scoring a postwar record of 125 goals in a Highland League season, beating Inverness Thistle&#x27;s previous postwar record of 124 in the 1969–70 season. With a record of 30 wins and 4 draws Brora ended the season as unbeaten champions, and were only the second club to complete an unbeaten season in the postwar era (following Caledonian in 1982–83). As Highland League champions, Brora entered the newly introduced promotion playoffs against Lowland League champions Edinburgh City. They won 4–2 in a penalty shootout after a 2–2 aggregate draw, with Stuart Kettlewell scoring the winner on 2 May. Brora played off against Montrose, the bottom-placed club in Scottish League Two, for a place in League Two for the 2015–16 season. After winning their home leg 1–0, Brora suffered a 3–1 defeat in the away game, thereby losing 3–2 on aggregate to remain in the Highland League.

The prospect of a future promotion to the national leagues has proven controversial due to the distances that players and supporters would be expected to travel to many of the away games. Before the 2014–15 season began, it had been suggested that supporters would be allowed to vote on whether the club should join the Scottish Professional Football League were it to qualify for promotion. However following Brora&#x27;s successful defence of their Highland League title, chairman John Young said that the club had &quot;looked at all options and there&#x27;s no way we can avoid competing. We meet SPFL criteria for entry level so we can’t opt out, we’ve got to go for it.&quot; Besides the impact on the club, it has been suggested that Brora itself would benefit economically from players and supporters of Southern clubs visiting the town.

The 2019–20 season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Brora were declared Highland League champions. They were due to progress to the playoffs with the Lowland League winner and the bottom club in League Two, but they were never held.

On 23 March 2021, in the 2020–21 Scottish Cup, Brora upset runaway Championship leaders and the previous season&#x27;s Scottish Cup finalists, Heart of Midlothian, 2–1 at Dudgeon Park, described as one of Scotland&#x27;s biggest cup shocks of all time.

For the second consecutive season, Brora were declared champions of the 2020–21 Highland Football League on a points per game formula due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was announced by the Highland Football League on 30 March 2021.

==Stadium==

Brora originally played at Inverbrora Park, which is now the site of the Hunters of Brora woollen mills, before moving to Dudgeon Park in 1932. The ground&#x27;s capacity is 4,000, including 200 seats. The record attendance was set in 2013 when over 2,000 people watched Brora play Rangers in a friendly match.

<doc id="834362" wikidata="Q5056406" url="?curid=834362" title="Cecilia Altonaga">
<text>Cecilia María Altonaga (born December 26, 1962) is the chief United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. She is the first Cuban-American woman to be appointed as a federal judge in the United States.

==Biography==
Altonaga was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to parents who escaped from the communist regime in Cuba. She attended Notre Dame Academy in Miami, graduating in 1980, and then received a Bachelor of Arts from Florida International University in 1983. Altonaga earned her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1986. She worked as an attorney in the Miami Dade County Attorney&#x27;s Office from 1986 to 1987, and then served as a law clerk to Edward B. Davis of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida from 1987 to 1988 before returning to the County Attorney&#x27;s Office as an assistant County Attorney until 1996. In 1996, Governor Lawton Chiles appointed her as a County Court Judge on Florida&#x27;s Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court. In 1999, she was elevated to circuit court judge in that district by Governor Jeb Bush.

== Federal judicial service==
On January 15, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Altonaga to be a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. She was nominated to the seat vacated by Shelby Highsmith who assumed senior status on March 15, 2002. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 2003, and received her commission the following day. During her time on the federal bench, Altonaga has been noted for her strong support of the recently created Florida International University College of Law, having served as the keynote speaker in the 2004 Convocation, judged several moot court competitions, and employed FIU law students as summer interns. She became chief judge on July 1, 2021.

===Notable cases and rulings===
On June 14, 2007, Altonaga ruled that US Sugar Corporation&#x27;s practice of pumping untreated wastewater into Lake Okeechobee was in violation of the Clean Water Act. Largely as a result of this decision, on June 25, 2008 the state of Florida announced plans to purchase of land controlled by US Sugar, which will be used to restore vital water flow between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades National Park, helping to ensure its survival in the face of competition for water from surrounding development.

She also presided over the trial of Charles McArther Emmanuel, son of former Liberian dictator Charles Taylor, for torture.

In September 2006, Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was accused of encouraging the abduction and enslavement of thousands of boys for use as jockeys in camel racing. A class action suit was filed in the state of Florida in the United States. In July 2007, Altonaga granted a motion to dismiss the suit because none of the involved parties resided in the United States.

In 2012, Altonaga disqualified the entire firm of Morgan &amp; Morgan PA from a class action suit for &quot;deplorable behavior&quot; in connection with depositions for the case, including insisting on holding them in a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, appearing dressed in t-shirt and shorts, bragging about playing Angry Birds while they were ongoing, and drawing and then showing off &quot;pictures of male genitalia&quot;.

On December 5, 2016, Altonaga rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s $450,000 penalty against Michael Boudreaux, the City of Miami&#x27;s budget director, for deceiving municipal bond investors, instead fining him $15,000.

In 2021, Altonaga was assigned to preside over the multidistrict litigation against stock trading company Robinhood, sued by its clients for suspending trading of GameStop stock during a national spike in the value of that stock.

In March 2024, Donald Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for an airing of &quot;This Week&quot;, arguing that Stephanopoulos harmed Trump&#x27;s reputation by claiming that Trump was found liable for raping the writer E. Jean Carroll in a New York case. Altonaga, presiding over the suit brought by Trump, denied a motion to dismiss by Stephanopoulos, finding that the technical definition used by the judge in the New York case did not examine the findings made by the jury.

===Supreme Court speculation===
In July 2005, following the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Altonaga&#x27;s name was raised as a potential George W. Bush Supreme Court candidate, a position for which she was promoted by Florida&#x27;s Hispanic community. However, it constitutes an extremely rare occurrence for a sitting District Court judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court, with the most recent occurrence being Edward Terry Sanford in 1923. At 43, Altonaga was younger than most other Hispanics or women who were being mentioned as possible nominees, which might have made her a more attractive choice to the President. President Bush went through several other nominees, and ultimately succeeded in nominating Judge Samuel Alito for the position.

==Personal life==
Altonaga married attorney George Mencio in 1986, with whom she has three daughters.

<text>213 (two hundred [and] thirteen) is the number following 212 and preceding 214.

213 and the other permutations of its digits are the only three-digit number whose digit sums and digit products are equal. It is a member of the quickly-growing Levine sequence, constructed from a triangle of numbers in which each row counts the copies of each value in the row below it.

As the product of the two distinct prime numbers 3 and 71, it is a semiprime, the first of a triple of three consecutive semiprimes 213, 214, and 215. Its square, 2132 = 45369, is one of only 15 known squares that can be represented as a sum of distinct factorials.

<text>In the United States, a federal judge is a judge who serves on a court established under Article Three of the U.S. Constitution. Often called &quot;Article III judges&quot;, federal judges include the chief justice and associate justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, circuit judges of the U.S. Courts of Appeals, district judges of the U.S. District Courts, and judges of the U.S. Court of International Trade.

Federal judges are not elected officials, unlike the president and vice president and U.S. senators and representatives. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The Constitution gives federal judges life tenure, and they hold their seats until they die, resign, or are removed from office through impeachment.

Strictly speaking, the term &quot;federal judge&quot; does not include U.S. magistrate judges or the judges of lesser federal tribunals such as the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the U.S. Tax Court, and other &quot;Article One tribunals&quot;. Nor does it apply to the administrative law judges of federal government agencies. Although these judges serve on courts of the federal government, they do not have life tenure, and their authority derives from Congress via Article One of the Constitution, not independently via Article Three. These judges are often known as &quot;Article One judges&quot;.

== Appointments ==
According to the Appointments Clause of Article Two of the U.S. Constitution, all federal judges, including the judges of the Supreme Court and inferior federal courts created by the Congress, shall be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The Constitution does not provide any eligibility criteria – such as age, literacy, citizenship, legal education, legal/bar or any professional certification, and legal/judicial experience – for one to be appointed as a federal judge.

==Powers and duties==
The primary function of the federal judges is to resolve matters brought before the United States federal courts. All federal courts in the United States are courts of limited jurisdiction, meaning that they hear only cases for which jurisdiction is authorized by the United States constitution or federal statutes. 

Federal district courts are authorized to hear a wide range of civil and criminal cases. District court judges are recognized as having a certain degree of inherent authority to manage the matters before them, ranging from setting the dates for trials and hearings to holding parties in contempt or otherwise sanctioning them for improper behavior. In other circumstances their actions are dictated by federal law, the federal rules of procedure, or &quot;local&quot; rules created by the specific court system itself.

==Allocation of cases==
The chief judge of each district court is responsible for overseeing assignments of judges to cases, following a written policy. For reasons of impartiality, this is typically done by a random drawing or rotation. Judges may also be assigned particular types of cases based on their technical expertise or assigned to cases in a specific geographic location.

Appeals courts and the Supreme Court use similar systems, but depending on the type of filing, may assign one, three, all, or some other number of judges to deal with a particular request. For example, emergency motions might require a response from only one judge assigned to be on duty for a particular time period, but final decisions in important cases require the whole court. Appeals courts range in size from 6 (First Circuit) to 29 (Ninth Circuit). Some judges have specific expertise by virtue of which court they sit on. 

By statute, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive appellate jurisdiction for patents, trademarks, and certain employee benefits. Because it geographically covers the headquarters of federal agencies, the judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit gain special expertise in administrative and constitutional law.

==Tenure==
Section 1 of Article Three of the U.S. Constitution provides that federal judges &quot;shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour&quot;. This clause has long been interpreted to give federal judges life tenure. Federal judges hold their seats until they resign, die, or are removed from office by impeachment. Although the legal orthodoxy is that judges cannot be removed from office except by Congressional impeachment, several legal scholars, including William Rehnquist, Saikrishna Prakash, and Steven D. Smith, have argued that the Good Behavior Clause may, in theory, permit removal by way of a writ of &quot;scire facias&quot; filed before a federal court, without resort to impeachment. Deaths of United States federal judges in active service may also have profound political and procedural effects, as such circumstances present substantially less opportunity for preparation for an orderly succession.

==Salary==
As of 2024, federal judges&#x27; annual salaries are: $246,300 for district judges, $257,900 for circuit judges, $298,500 for associate Supreme Court justices, and $312,200 for the Chief Justice of the United States. Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly pleaded for an increase in judicial pay, calling the situation &quot;a constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary&quot;. For some partners at leading law firms, especially in major metropolitan areas, becoming a federal judge can represent a more than 90 percent pay cut. Associates at the largest U.S. law firms with judicial clerkship experience already earn as much as a federal judge in their first year as full-time associates. 

When those attorneys eventually become experienced partners and reach the stage in life where one would normally consider switching to public service, their interest in joining the judiciary is tempered by the prospect of a giant pay cut back to what they were making 10 to 20 years earlier, adjusted for inflation. One way for attorneys to soften the financial blow is to spend only a few years on the bench and then return to private practice or go into private arbitration, but such turnover creates a risk of a revolving door judiciary subject to regulatory capture. Roberts has warned that &quot;judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar&quot; and &quot;If judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to a lucrative position in private practice, the Framers&#x27; goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy.&quot;

==Duty station==
Each federal judge serves at a particular &quot;duty station&quot; for the duration of their federal service. This is important because of the relationship among several federal statutes. First, 28 U.S.C. § 456(a) entitles federal judges to reimbursement of transportation and &quot;subsistence&quot; expenses incurred while transacting official business away from their duty stations. Section 456 also prescribes that the District of Columbia is the duty station of all members of the U.S. Supreme Court, the D.C. Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Second, there are several reasons federal judges need to transact official business outside of their regular courthouse. 28 U.S.C. §§ 291 and 292 authorize a broad variety of temporary reassignments of circuit and district judges, both horizontally (i.e., to other circuits or districts) and vertically, so that a district judge can hear appeals and a circuit judge can try cases. 

Many federal judges serve on administrative panels like the judicial council for their circuit or the Judicial Conference of the United States. Some of the larger circuit courts like the Ninth Circuit hold regular sessions at multiple locations, and randomly select three-judge panels to hear appeals from all sitting circuit judges regardless of duty station. Videoconferencing is sometimes now used to reduce the burden of frequent travel on circuit judges.

==Discipline==
The discipline process of federal judges is initiated by the filing of a complaint by any person alleging that a judge has engaged in conduct &quot;prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts, or alleging that such judge is unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability.&quot; If the chief judge of the circuit does not dismiss the complaint or conclude the proceedings, then they must promptly appoint himself or herself, along with equal numbers of circuit judges and district judges, to a special committee to investigate the facts and allegations in the complaint. The committee must conduct such investigation as it finds necessary and then expeditiously file a comprehensive written report of its investigation with the judicial council of the circuit involved. Upon receipt of such a report, the judicial council of the circuit involved may conduct any additional investigation it deems necessary, and it may dismiss the complaint.

If a judge who is the subject of a complaint holds their office during good behavior, action taken by the judicial council may include certifying disability of the judge. The judicial council may also, in its discretion, refer any complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 351, along with the record of any associated proceedings and its recommendations for appropriate action, to the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Judicial Conference may exercise its authority under the judicial discipline provisions as a conference, or through a standing committee appointed by the chief justice.

==Retirement==
Judges who meet their age and service requirements may retire and will then earn their final salary for the remainder of their life, plus cost-of-living increases. The &quot;Rule of 80&quot; is the commonly used shorthand for the age and service requirement for a judge to retire, or assume senior status, as set forth in Title 28 of the U.S. Code, section 371(c). Beginning at age 65, judges may retire at their current salary, or take senior status, after performing 15 years of active service as an Article III judge (65 + 15 = 80). A sliding scale of increasing age and decreasing service (66 + 14, 67 + 13, 68 + 12, 69 + 11) results in eligibility for retirement compensation at age 70 with a minimum of 10 years of service (70 + 10 = 80).

Under section 376 a survivor&#x27;s annuity to benefit the widow, widower or minor child of the judge may be purchased via a deduction of 2.2% to 3.5% from the retirement benefit.

==Number of judges==
, there were 890 authorized Article III judgeships: nine on the Supreme Court, 179 on the courts of appeals, 677 for the US District Courts (includes territorial courts), 16 on the US Court of Federal Claims* and nine on the Court of International Trade.

The total number of active federal judges is constantly in flux, for two reasons. First, judges retire or die, and a lapse of time occurs before new judges are appointed to fill those positions. Second, from time to time Congress will increase (or, less frequently, decrease) the number of federal judgeships in a particular judicial district, usually in response to shifting population numbers or a changing workload in that district. Although the number of Supreme Court justices has remained the same for well over a century, the number of court of appeals judges has more than doubled since 1950, and the number of district court judges has increased more than three-fold in that period. In addition, some district court judges serve on more than one court at a time.

==Non-Article III judges==
Unlike the judges of Article III courts, non-Article III judges are appointed for specified terms of office. Examples include United States magistrate judges and judges of the United States bankruptcy courts, United States Tax Court, United States Court of Federal Claims, and United States territorial courts. Although the term &quot;non-Article III judges&quot; is used to describe the absence of tenure and salary protection, bankruptcy courts are formally designated as divisions of U.S. District Courts, whose district judges are Article III judicial officers. Moreover, in &quot;Freytag v. Commissioner&quot;, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), the Supreme Court concluded that the judges of the U.S. Tax Court (and their special trial judges) exercise a portion of &quot;the judicial power of the United States.&quot;

<doc id="834371" wikidata="Q1179317" url="?curid=834371" title="Dazzy Vance">
<text>Charles Arthur &quot;Dazzy&quot; Vance (March 4, 1891 – February 16, 1961) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a pitcher for five different franchises in Major League Baseball (MLB) in a career that spanned twenty years. Known for his impressive fastball, Vance was the only pitcher to lead the National League in strikeouts seven consecutive seasons. Vance was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.

==Early life==
Born in Orient, Iowa, Vance spent most of his childhood in Nebraska. He played semipro baseball there, then signed on with a minor league baseball team out of Red Cloud, Nebraska, a member of the Nebraska State League, in 1912. After pitching for two other Nebraska State League teams in 1913 (Superior) and 1914 (Hastings Giants), Vance made a brief major league debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1915 and appeared with the New York Yankees that year as well. However, it took several years before he established himself as a major league player.

Vance was discovered to have an arm injury in 1916 and was given medical treatment. He continued to work on his pitching in the minor leagues, appearing with teams in Columbus, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio; Memphis, Tennessee; Rochester, New York; and Sacramento, California. Vance only reappeared in the major leagues once for the Yankees, pitching two games in 1918. Vance said he was suddenly able to throw hard again in 1921 while pitching for the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association: he struck out 163 batters and finished the season with a 21–11 win–loss record. The Pelicans sold his contract to the Brooklyn Robins in 1922. The Robins wanted to acquire catcher Hank DeBerry, but the Pelicans refused to complete the deal unless Vance was included in the transaction.

==Major league career==
Vance and DeBerry formed a successful battery during their tenure with Brooklyn. In 1922, Vance produced an 18–12 record with a 3.70 earned run average (ERA) and a league-leading 134 strikeouts. His best individual season came in 1924, when he led the National League in wins (28), strikeouts (262) and ERA (2.16)—the pitching Triple Crown—en route to winning the National League Most Valuable Player Award. Vance set the then-National League record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game when he fanned 15 Chicago Cubs in a game on August 23, 1924. He later struck-out 17 batters in a 10-inning game in 1925.

On September 24, 1924, Vance became the sixth pitcher in major-league history to pitch an immaculate inning, striking out all three batters on nine total pitches in the third inning of a game against the Cubs. He finished the season with 262 strikeouts, more than any two National League pitchers combined (Burleigh Grimes with 135 and Dolf Luque with 86 were second and third respectively). That season, Vance had one out of every 13 strikeouts in the entire National League. Vance pitched a no-hitter on September 13, 1925, against the Philadelphia Phillies, winning 10–1.

Vance was involved in one of the most famous flubs in baseball history, the &quot;three men on third&quot; incident during the 1926 season. With Vance on second and Chick Fewster on first, Babe Herman hit a long ball and began racing around the bases. As Herman rounded second, the third base coach yelled at him to go back, since Fewster had not yet passed third. Vance, having rounded third, misunderstood and reversed course, returning to third. Fewster arrived at third. Herman ignored the instruction and also arrived at third. The third baseman tagged out Herman and Fewster; Vance was declared safe by rule.

Vance&#x27;s play began to decline in the early 1930s and he bounced to the St. Louis Cardinals (becoming a member of the team known as the Gashouse Gang), Cincinnati Reds and back to the Dodgers. On September 12, 1934, Vance hit his seventh and final major league home run at 43 years and 6 months, the second oldest pitcher to do so to this day. However, just a week later commenting for a newspaper article, Vance said that he did not recommend baseball as a career to young men. Vance pointed out that very few people could make a good living out of it, especially during a time when increasing major league salaries were attracting many college-educated men who would have previously chosen other work.

Vance retired after the 1935 season. He led the league in ERA three times, wins twice, and established a National League record by leading the league in strikeouts in seven consecutive years (1922–1928). Vance retired with a 197–140 record, 2,045 strikeouts and a 3.24 ERA — remarkable numbers considering he saw only 33 innings of big league play during his twenties.

==Later life==

Vance enjoyed hunting and fishing when he retired to Homosassa Springs, Florida, where he had lived since the 1920s. In 1938, Vance became ill with pneumonia. The illness worsened and kept him hospitalized for several months. Vance recovered and became a frequent guest at Brooklyn old-timers games.

Vance was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. He learned of his election when a highway patrolman got his attention on a local highway and told him that a photographer was at his house. A Dazzy Vance Day celebration was held in Brooklyn. Biographer John Skipper characterized his Hall of Fame induction as &quot;subdued&quot; compared to the celebration in Brooklyn.

Vance died of a heart attack in 1961 in Homosassa Springs. His obituary in &quot;The Sporting News&quot; said that he had been under a doctor&#x27;s care but that he was active and thought to be in relatively good health when he died. His survivors included his wife Edyth and a daughter.

==Legacy==
In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. Vance is mentioned in the 1949 poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

<text>Buckie Thistle Football Club are a senior football club based in the town of Buckie, Moray, who currently play in Scotland&#x27;s Highland Football League. Founded in 1889, they are also known as &quot;The Jags&quot; and play their football at Victoria Park, Buckie.

== History ==

Although there is no accurate date for Buckie Thistle&#x27;s formation, it is widely accepted that the club was formed in 1889. The early years saw the club play a number of challenge matches before being accepted into the &quot;Banff and District League&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
It was not until the 1909–10 season that Buckie Thistle joined the Highland League, becoming the first team from Banffshire to be accepted into the league, with Morayshire having been represented for several years by Forres Mechanics and Elgin City. Buckie have since gone on to win eleven league titles as well as numerous cup competitions, although they had to wait fifty-two years between their eighth (1957–58) and ninth (2009–10) title wins.

Buckie Thistle&#x27;s first-choice kit is identical to that of Celtic&#x27;s green and white hoops, and local legend has it that Celtic donated the strips to the club.
In 1989 Celtic came north to play a friendly to mark &quot;The Jags&quot; centenary year and earlier, at the start of the decade, had visited Victoria Park to play in a fund-raising match for the spires appeal of St. Peters RC Church, Buckie.

The 1950s was a decade when all trophies available were won with regularity. It was during this era that Buckie Thistle travelled to Hampden Park to meet Queen&#x27;s Park in a Scottish Cup 4th round replay on 30 October 1954, prevailing 2–1 and thus becoming the first – and still only – senior non-league club to have won a competitive match at the national stadium.
&lt;br&gt;
The ambitious club board has extensively developed the stadium in recent years, with a function hall being built within the perimeter of the ground, enabling sponsors and spectators to enjoy licensed and catering facilities pre- and post-match at the venue.

Horror author Stephen King mentioned Buckie Thistle in his 2020 book &quot;If It Bleeds&quot;. He then sent The Jags two copies of the book to be auctioned and a picture of himself in their football strip.

=== Season 2007–08 ===
Buckie Thistle bolstered their squad for the 2007–08 season with the signings of Craig MacMillan, Tony Low, Graeme Stewart, David Macrae, Brian Neill, Bob Duncan and Andrew Courage. The Jags started the season as one of the favourites to win the league title for the first time in 50 years and managed to live up to this tag early on with an opening day victory over Fraserburgh followed by a first round win away to Cove Rangers in the Aberdeenshire Cup. Buckie went on to lift the Aberdeenshire Cup with a 1–0 victory over Keith in the final after beating rivals Deveronvale in the semi-final.

Buckie went on to complete the Aberdeenshire Double by winning the Shield with a 3–0 victory over Inverurie Loco Works in the final, having defeated Fraserburgh and Huntly on the way to the final.

In their Scottish Cup campaign, Buckie started off with a 2–1 victory away to Glasgow University in the first round. It was the first year that all Highland League sides entered the Scottish Cup proper without having to qualify and Buckie looked to make the most of the opportunity to go far. The Jags progressed to the Third Round of the competition after defeating Highland League rivals Nairn County 4–1. Thistle were then handed a tough tie against Scottish First Division side Greenock Morton. After going 2–0 down early they fought back to 2–2, only for Morton to score a last minute winner and knock Buckie out of the cup.

After a good start to the league campaign, the second half of the season went less well after going out of the Scottish Cup. Buckie failed to beat fellow title rivals such as Keith and Cove Rangers and this ultimately ended their title hopes. Craig MacMillan was Buckie&#x27;s top goalscorer in 2007–08, scoring 21 goals, while Stephen Bruce scored a total of 11 goals.

On 20 April 2008, former Aberdeen, Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers and Scotland international Striker Duncan Shearer was sacked as manager of Buckie Thistle. Shearer was sacked just one day after a home defeat to Cove Rangers which all but ended Thistle&#x27;s hopes of winning the league championship. During Shearer&#x27;s reign as manager he managed to win the Aberdeenshire Cup twice and the Aberdeenshire Shield once.

On 13 May 2008 Kevin and Doug Will were revealed as Buckie Thistle&#x27;s new management team for a second spell.

=== Season 2008–09 ===
Early transfer activity in what was the Wills second spell in charge saw Graeme Stewart leaving for Inverurie Locos before striker Charlie Brown arrived from Forres Mechanics. In addition Iain Good and Donnie Monro (returning to the club) were brought in from Peterhead and Martin Charlesworth from Elgin City. A late arrival to the club saw 23-year-old defender Stuart Cumming sign from Montrose in September.

On 17 October, Buckie Thistle announced the sacking of Kevin and Doug Will after a start to the season which saw the club fall 15 points behind in the league and get knocked out of the Challenge Cup, Aberdeenshire Cup and Aberdeenshire Shield. The 3–1 defeat to Junior Side Banks O&#x27;Dee in the Aberdeenshire Shield was their final game in charge.

Buckie appointed Gregg Carrol as manager on 21 October. Carrol had in fact already been offered the job back in May but had rejected it. Carrol was unable to prevent a 3–0 defeat to Lochee United in his first game in charge in the Scottish Cup. Buckie then suffered a 3–2 defeat to Clachnacuddin in the league before embarking on a nine-game winning streak, including wins over rivals Deveronvale and a 7–1 victory over Fort William leading them to be in contention for the title.

=== Season 2009–10 ===
Despite losing their opening two league games, Buckie went on to win the League Championship for the first time in 52 years, clinching the title on 1 May following a 3–0 win at Wick Academy. In addition they also won the Aberdeenshire Cup beating Cove Rangers 2–0 in September 2009, with both goals being scored by Stephen Bruce.

=== Season 2010–11 ===
On 7 May 2011, Buckie defeated their local rivals and nearest challengers Deveronvale 2–1 at Victoria Park to clinch the title for the second year in succession. Goals from Martin Charlesworth and Andy Low overturned an opening goal by Mark Chisholm.
This was the first time that the Jags had won back to back titles since 1956–57 and 1957–58.
In addition to retaining the League championship the club were runners up in the Aberdeenshire Cup, this time losing to Cove Rangers and reached the fifth round of the Scottish Cup narrowly losing 2–0 to Brechin City.

=== Season 2011–12 ===
The club entered the Challenge Cup for the first time, and were drawn away to Forfar Athletic in the first round. They lost 5–4 on penalties following a very creditable 1–1 draw.
The season ended on a high note when the club won the Highland League Cup, beating Cove Rangers 2–0 at Banff.

However, they could not make it three Highland League titles in a row, as they finished fifth. The title was won by Forres Mechanics.

It was officially announced on 4 June 2012 that Gregg Carroll had resigned his post as Buckie Thistle manager and retired from football. He was replaced by his former assistant Gary Hake and then by Graeme Stewart who is the current manager.

<text>Clachnacuddin Football Club is a part-time, senior Scottish football club based in the city of Inverness, that currently plays in the Highland Football League.

Clachnacuddin have won the most Highland Football League championships in the competition&#x27;s history: a total of 18, a title shared with, now defunct side, Caledonian. Their home ground is Grant Street Park in the city&#x27;s Merkinch area. They also have a youth system, with many teams ranging from the primary squads to the under 19s.

The club operates a reserve team in the North Caledonian Football League, which they rejoined in 2022–23 after withdrawing at the start of the 2014–15 season.

They were founded in 1885 and are nicknamed &quot;The Lilywhites&quot; (due to their white strip) or &quot;Clach&quot;. Their name is an English approximation of a Scots Gaelic name meaning &quot;the stone of the tub&quot;, referring to a city landmark in Inverness.

As a full member of the Scottish FA, they are entitled to enter the Scottish Cup each year.

==Ground==
Clachnacuddin have played at Grant Street Park in the Merkinch area of Inverness since the ground opened in 1886. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 3,000 spectators.

On 23 May 1988 a major fire destroyed Grant Street&#x27;s wooden grandstand with vandalism blamed.

On the morning of Christmas Eve 2019, a fire broke out in the kit room due to an electrical fault in a tumble drier. As a result, Clachnacuddin&#x27;s home game against Formartine United was called off. Following this incident, Clach were put into a temporary groundshare with Highland RFC at Canal Park, in the Bught area of Inverness.

<text>The CRC Press, LLC is an American publishing group that specializes in producing technical books. Many of their books relate to engineering, science and mathematics. Their scope also includes books on business, forensics and information technology. CRC Press is now a division of Taylor &amp; Francis, itself a subsidiary of Informa.

== History ==
The CRC Press was founded as the Chemical Rubber Company (CRC) in 1903 by brothers Arthur, Leo and Emanuel Friedman in Cleveland, Ohio, based on an earlier enterprise by Arthur, who had begun selling rubber laboratory aprons in 1900. The company gradually expanded to include sales of laboratory equipment to chemists. In 1913 the CRC offered a short (116-page) manual called the &quot;Rubber Handbook&quot; as an incentive for any purchase of a dozen aprons. Since then the &quot;Rubber Handbook&quot; has evolved into the CRC&#x27;s flagship book, the &quot;CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics&quot;. Another one of CRC&#x27;s highly successful reference handbooks, &quot;CRC Standard Mathematical Tables&quot;, has sold over 2 million copies.

In 1964, Chemical Rubber decided to focus on its publishing ventures, and in 1973 the company changed its name to CRC Press, Inc, and exited the manufacturing business, spinning off that line as the Lab Apparatus Company. 

In 1986 CRC Press was bought by the Times Mirror Company. Times Mirror began exploring the possibility of a sale of CRC Press in 1996, and in December announced the sale of CRC to Information Ventures. In 2003, CRC became part of Taylor &amp; Francis, which in 2004 became part of the UK publisher Informa.

<doc id="834384" wikidata="Q6584188" url="?curid=834384" title="Mechai Viravaidya">
<text>Mechai Viravaidya (born 17 January 1941, ; ) is a former politician and activist in Thailand known for promoting condoms, family planning, and AIDS awareness. Since the 1970s, Mechai has been affectionately called &quot;Mr. Condom&quot;, and condoms are often referred to as &quot;mechais&quot; in Thailand. From the time that he began his work, the average number of children in Thai families has decreased from 7 to 1.5. He has been credited with leading efforts that improved the lives of millions of people.

==Early life==
Viravaidya was born in Bangkok to a Scottish mother and a Thai father, both of whom were doctors and had met while studying in Edinburgh. He is one of four children. His younger brother, Sunya, is the founder of the Pattaya International Hospital. One of his sisters, Sumalee Viravaidya, was a journalist in the 1970s, writing for the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. Viravaidya was educated in Australia at Geelong Grammar School and at Trinity College of the University of Melbourne, where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree. In 1965, he returned to Thailand and in 1966, he started to work in family planning, emphasizing the use of condoms. In 1973, he left the civil service and founded a nonprofit service organization, the Population and Community Development Association (PDA), to continue his efforts to improve the lives of the rural poor. He used such events as condom-blowing contests for schoolchildren, encouraging taxi drivers to hand out condoms to their customers, and founding a restaurant chain called Cabbages and Condoms, where condoms were given to customers with the bill.

Next to the original restaurant, in Bangkok, there is a family planning clinic, one of several places in the Thai capital where poor women can receive pregnancy termination, a practice that is legal in the country per Section 305 of the Thai penal code but often perceived as illegal. The clinic is permitted by the authorities due to the dangers of unsafe abortion caused by economic difficulties.

==Later life==
Viravaidya served as deputy minister of industry from 1985 to 1986, under prime minister Prem Tinsulanonda. He later served as senator from 1987 until 1991. During this time, AIDS appeared in Thailand, and he increased his efforts to promote sexual-safety awareness.

A military coup in 1991 installed prime minister Anand Panyarachun, who then appointed Viravaidya minister for tourism, information, and AIDS. He was able to start a large, successful AIDS education campaign and served until 1992. At that time, he became the chairman of the Foundation for International Education, a nonprofit organization that serves as the governing body of the NIST International School. Viravaidya continued to serve as chair until stepping down in May 2002.

In 1995, he was appointed an honorary officer of the Order of Australia, for &quot;service to Australian-Thai relations and contributions to the world AIDS debate&quot;.

In 2004, Viravaidya again became a senator. In 2006, he won praise from the toilet industry (but criticism from the retail industry) for proposing that retailers be obliged to build a public toilet for every ten square metres of retail space.

As of 2007, Viravaidya continued to oversee rural development and health initiatives as the chairman of PDA, now the largest NGO in Thailand, with 600 employees and 12,000 volunteers. On 29 May 2007, PDA was awarded the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&#x27;s Gates Award in recognition of its pioneering work in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention. This award came with a grant of $1,000,000.

<doc id="834387" wikidata="Q7690595" url="?curid=834387" title="Tboli people">
<text>The Tboli people () are an Austronesian indigenous people of South Cotabato in southern Mindanao in the Philippines. 
==Ethnology==

Tbolis currently reside on the mountain slopes on either side of the upper Alah Valley and the coastal area of Maitum, Maasim and Kiamba in the province of Sarangani. In former times, the Tbolis also resided in the upper floor of the Alah Valley. After World War II and the arrival of settlers from other parts of the Philippines, they have been gradually pushed to the mountain slopes. As of now, they have almost been expelled from the fertile valley floor.

Like their immediate neighbouring ethnic groups, the Úbûs, Blàan, Blit, Tàú-Segél, and the Tasaday, they have historically been described as pagans, animists, etc., as opposed to Muslim peoples or Christian settlers. In political contexts, however, the Cebuano term &quot;Lumad&quot; (&quot;native&quot;) has become an umbrella term for the various polytheistic peoples of Mindanao.

In ethnographic and linguistic literature on Mindanao, their name is variously spelt Tboli, T&#x27;boli, Tböli, Tagabili, Tagabilil, Tagabulul and Tau Bilil. Their endonym is Tboli. Their whereabouts and identity are somewhat imprecise in the literature; some publications present the Tboli and the Tagabili as distinct peoples; some locate the Tbolis in the vicinity of Lake Buluan in the Cotabato Basin or in Agusan del Norte. 

Tbolis speak their native language of the same name. However, over the decades, Tbolis can speak and understand Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Tagalog and to the some extent, Ilocano, alongside their own native language. These languages were brought and introduced by these settlers from Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, Negros, Panay, Tagalog-speaking regions, Central Luzon and Ilocandia, upon their arrival into Tboli homelands during the early 20th century. 

They are considered to be an indigenous people in Philippine law.

==Music==

The Tboli have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles – ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs that act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument.

Other instruments include the hegelung.

==Tboli religion==
The Tboli have a tradition of a highly complex polytheistic religion. However, more recent variants of their religion have been influenced by Islam and Christianity. Nevertheless, some continue to preserve religious practices from thousands of years old traditions.

<doc id="834399" wikidata="Q903453" url="?curid=834399" title="Decriminalization">
<text>Decriminalization or decriminalisation is the legislative process which removes prosecutions against an action so that the action remains illegal but has no criminal penalties or at most some civil fine. This reform is sometimes applied retroactively but otherwise comes into force from either the enactment of the law or from a specified date. In some cases regulated permits or fines may still apply (for contrast, see: legalization), and associated aspects of the original criminalized act may remain or become specifically classified as crimes. The term was coined by anthropologist Jennifer James to express sex workers&#x27; movements&#x27; &quot;goals of removing laws used to target prostitutes&quot;, although it is now commonly applied to drug policies. The reverse process is criminalization.

Decriminalization reflects changing social and moral views. A society may come to the view that an act is not harmful, should no longer be criminalised, or is otherwise not a matter to be addressed by the criminal justice system. Examples of subject matter which have been the subject of changing views on criminality over time in various societies and countries include:

*Abortion (see: abortion law and abortion-rights movements)
*Breastfeeding in public
*Drug possession, and recreational drug use (see: drug liberalization)
*Euthanasia (see: legality of euthanasia)
*Gambling (see: gambling age)
*Homosexuality (see: decriminalization of homosexuality and LGBT rights by country or territory)
*Polygamy (see: legality of polygamy)
*Poverty (see: criminalization of poverty)
*Prostitution (see: decriminalization of sex work)
*Public nudity
*steroid use in sport
*Suicide (see: suicide legislation)

In a federal country, acts may be decriminalized by one level of government while still subject to penalties levied by another; for example, possession of a decriminalized drug may still be subject to criminal charges by one level of government, but another may yet impose a monetary fine. This should be contrasted with legalization, which removes all or most legal detriments from a previously illegal act.

Many countries have the practice of not imposing prison sentences for that are considered as illegal but a less serious crime under that country&#x27;s law, such as personal use of cannabis or personal use of certain other drugs without a prescription from a doctor.

<doc id="834412" wikidata="Q72808061" url="?curid=834412" title="Magical Drop">
<text>, sometimes referred to in Japanese as , is a series of puzzle games first released in the arcade, and later primarily for several platforms such as the Neo Geo Arcade, Super Famicom, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Bandai WonderSwan, GBC and the Neo Geo Pocket Color; most of which were published by Data East.

==Gameplay==
A stack of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player&#x27;s clown at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. Chains are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent&#x27;s stack to descend faster.

There are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent&#x27;s stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.

==History==
&quot;Magical Drop&quot; is based on a game called &quot;Drop-Drop&quot; created by Russ Ltd, a Russian company.

In 1995, Data East released the first game in the series as a coin-operated version of this game titled &quot;Magical Drop&quot; (known in North America as &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;). Despite the arcade game being released worldwide while using the English title in North America and Europe, Data East gave the official English names of its successors the same names as their Japanese counterparts, while the home versions of the first game were never released outside Japan. The series became better known for its Neo Geo sequels, &quot;Magical Drop II&quot; and &quot;Magical Drop III&quot;, due to the popularity of the Neo Geo platform. The last games in the series released in the United States were &quot;Magical Drop Pocket&quot; for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1999 and &quot;Magical Drop&quot; for the Game Boy Color in 2000.

G-mode bought and currently now owns the intellectual rights to the &quot;Magical Drop&quot; franchise along with several other of Data East&#x27;s franchises and titles. While Data East declared bankruptcy in 2003, other publishers have re-released the PlayStation titles &quot;Magical Drop 3 + Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Magical Drop F&quot;. &quot;Magical Drop II&quot; and &quot;Magical Drop III&quot; are also available on the subscription service GameTap. In 2007, the Super Famicom version of the first &quot;Magical Drop&quot; title was released in Japan on the Virtual Console for the Wii by G-mode. In 2009, versions of Magical Drop for Android phones and iPhone were released in May and September, respectively.

&quot;Magical Drop II&quot; was released on the Virtual Console by G-mode in May 25, 2010. The same year, &quot;Magical Drop III&quot; was included as part of &quot;Data East Arcade Classics&quot; and released on the Virtual Console in Japan on July 6. UTV Ignition Entertainment published a new sequel, &quot;Magical Drop V&quot;. Handled by the French developer Golgoth Studio, the game was released for PC on November 15, 2012. Another sequel by Forever Entertainment is scheduled to be released on Nintendo Switch in winter 2022.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Magical Drop&quot; on their September 1, 1995 issue as being the tenth most-successful arcade game of the month. A review of the arcade version of the original game in &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Chain Reaction&quot; is proving quite popular in Japan, despite the fact that this kind of game has been around now for at least five years&quot;. The reviewer scored the game two out of five stars, concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s not brilliant nor innovative, certainly not new, but it&#x27;s fun and as addictive as sex after lunch... in a jester suit&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; gave the Saturn version an 84 out of 100, with the reviewers remarking that the game is addictive and offers numerous options, but is frustratingly difficult in single-player mode. They disagreed as to whether it is better or worse than its competitor &quot;Baku Baku Animal&quot;.

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Magical Drop II&quot; on their May 1, 1996 issue as being the fifth most-successful arcade game of the month. &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the Neo Geo AES version of &quot;Magical Drop II&quot; three out of five stars, saying that it becomes monotonous after a while, but is overall solid and reasonably addictive. He found the game&#x27;s most distinctive quality was its accelerated pace, remarking that &quot;you don&#x27;t have to be as precise as [in] some puzzle games, but there is no time to think, just time to do&quot;. Reviewing the Nintendo Switch release, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; called it &quot;a true classic, and a must-play for puzzle game fans&quot;. Similarly to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, the reviewer said that the game is defined by how it rewards fast reflexes rather than strategy, particularly noting that there is no need to plan out combos as in most games of its type, a variation which he found &quot;nothing short of exhilarating&quot;. Additionally praising the colorful atmosphere and presentation, catchy music, engaging multiplayer, and ideal use of the Joy-Con controller, he gave it 8 out of 10 stars.

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Magical Drop III&quot; on their April 1, 1997 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the month.

Engadget and Destructoid gave &quot;Magical Drop V&quot; mixed-to-negative reviews, citing numerous glitches, lack of series-staple features and mechanics, and an incredibly poor translation.

<text>Francesco Fontana (, Naples – July 1656, Naples) was an Italian lawyer and an astronomer.

==Biography==
Francesco Fontana studied law at the University of Naples and then he became a lawyer in the court at the Castel Capuano. But failing to always find truth in the Court, he began to study mathematics and astronomy. He created woodcuts showing the Moon and the planets as he saw them through a self-constructed telescope. Fontana was close to the botanist Fabio Colonna, who commissioned him to make microscopic observations in 1625, and the Neapolitan Jesuits, and in particular Fathers Gerolamo Sersale, Giovanni Battista Zupi and Giovanni Giacomo Staserio. Fontana traced, in 1636, the first drawing of Mars and discovered its rotation. In February 1646 he published the book &quot;Novae coelestium terrestriumq[ue] rerum observationes, et fortasse hactenus non-vulgatae&quot;, where he presented all the observations of the Moon made from 1629 until 1645, the drawings of the bands seen on Jupiter&#x27;s disc, the strange appearances of Saturn, as well as of the stars of the Milky Way. With a Fontana&#x27;s telescope, the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Zupi observed for the first time in 1639 the phases of Mercury, an evidence, together with the phases of Venus observed by Galileo in 1610, that the Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric theory was correct.

In the autumn of 1639, testing a 22-palm telescope of his own making, Fontana discovered the characteristic bands of Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere.

In 1645, he claimed to have observed a satellite of Venus (Paul Stroobant demonstrated in 1887 that all similar observations were not related to a putative satellite of Venus).

He died of plague in Naples with the whole family in July 1656.

The lunar crater Fontana and the crater Fontana on Mars are named in his honor.

== Telescope ==
Fontana began his career as optician around 1620, acquiring a certain reputation with the members of the Accademia dei Lincei, for whom he made numerous microscopes and with whom he worked as microscopist. Near the end of the decade this collaboration terminated, perhaps due to Fontana’s close ties with the Neapolitan Jesuits, hostile to the ideas of Galileo. Fontana had also built small telescopes at least as early as 1626, and was already producing instruments eight palms long by 1629. It was some years, however, before his fame spread beyond Naples and the narrow circle of the Linceans, whose chief interest was naturalist research. In early 1637, some of Fontana’s lenses arrived in Rome.

By early 1637, Fontana was already making telescopes much larger than those commonly used at the time. Since he had first entered the field of astronomy, in fact, the structure of the telescope had remained unchanged, as well as its size, and hence its magnifying power. Fontana’s instrument thus marked a major turning point, showing that the telescope, far from having fully expressed all its potential, could still be greatly improved; and not in size alone. Since his first model known to us Fontana had, in fact, adopted the converging eyepiece. This optical combination had already been theorised by Kepler in his &quot;Dioptrice&quot;, published in Augsburg in 1611 but Fontana was very likely the first to apply it in practice and certainly the first to make it widely known. Unlike the so-called Galilean telescope, fitted with a diverging eyepiece, the Keplerian telescope produces upside-down images (not a serious drawback for astronomical purposes) but offers the advantage of a much larger and brighter field of view.

Starting in 1637 then, Fontana sent numerous lenses for inspection to Benedetto Castelli – the renowned pupil and collaborator of Galileo – who was staying in Rome at the time. Among them, in June of the following year, was the objective for a telescope 14 palms long (~ 3.1 m). This instrument was enthusiastically accepted by Castelli, who used it for planetary observations and urged the Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici in vain to buy it (it was finally purchased by the Prince of Ecchembergh for the original price of 200 scudi).

Despite Castelli’s wholehearted support, Fontana’s optical products received a very cold welcome, being considered inferior or only slightly superior to those produced by the grand-ducal craftsmen. Dating from March 1638, for instance, is a letter in which Vincentio Reinieri informs Galileo of the arrival in Genoa of ‘a portrait of the Moon, sent […] by F.D. Benedetto Castelli, with the report of a new telescope invented by a certain Fontana in Naples,’ asking Galileo if he had heard anything of this. In the reply, which has been lost, Galileo must have belittled the quality of Fontana’s telescopes, as can be deduced from a letter written the following April in which Renieri states that he has ‘been glad to find out that the spyglasses from Naples are not so miraculous as others have written, because, at the great price that was asked for them’, he had despaired of ever having one. In fact Fontana had to struggle against the stubborn reluctance of Galileo, now old and blind, to recognise the superiority of the new Neapolitan telescopes (although admitting that their magnification power was greater than those produced in Florence, he believed they could reveal nothing that he himself had not already discovered) and the Medicean court’s fear of losing its unchallenged primacy in optical production. For this reason the strategy pursued by Ferdinando II was not so much that of purchasing a few models as of discovering the secret of their construction. In Florence, Fontana’s optical devices were carefully examined by the grand-ducal artisans and Galileo himself, as well as Castelli, reflected on the possible techniques adopted by the Neapolitan telescope maker. Near the end of 1638 negotiations were even held, during which Fontana offered to give the Grand Duke exclusive rights to his method of processing lenses for the price of 2,000 scudi. The amount was deemed too high, and no agreement was reached.

In the meantime however, thanks not only to Castelli but also to Giovanni Camillo Glorioso, who from 1613 to 1621 had occupied the prestigious chair at the University of Padua that had once been Galileo’s, the fame of Fontana’s telescopes had spread through much of the peninsula. In March 1638, from Naples, Glorioso had informed Antonio Santini in Milan, of an ‘admirable’ 8-palm telescope, and in the following July, of a 14-palm model with which ‘Jupiter looks like the Moon when full, and has the same cavities and prominences as are found on the Moon; Mars appears a little smaller than Jupiter, and at its centre is a prominence shaped like a very dark cone.’ In September he sent him an interesting drawing of Saturn, done by Fontana himself, which Santini then sent to Peter Linder, in Venice. Still from Milan, Giovanni Giacomo Cozzolani informed Carlo Antonio Manzini, in Bologna (where the news also reached Bonaventura Cavalieri) of the wondrous new phenomena observed with Fontana’s ‘spyglass’. Information, albeit confused and fragmentary, on the new 14-palm telescopes, evidently able to show the surface details of planets for the first time, reached Holland, England and France as well (where René Descartes believed that Fontana had managed to fabricate hyperbolic lenses).

In October of 1639, tired of trusting to the mediation of Castelli, Fontana wrote directly to the Grand Duke offering him a 22-palm telescope. As proof of the instrument’s outstanding quality the letter, which has only recently come to light, 12 contains enclosed a drawing of Jupiter made by Fontana himself, which constitutes as of now the earliest representation of the planet’s bands, whose discovery was later to be claimed by (or attributed to) many other authors.

==Microscope==

Fontana also claimed to have invented the compound microscope (two or more lenses in a tube) in 1618, an invention that has many claimants including Cornelis Drebbel, Zacharias Jansen or his father Hans Martens, and Galileo Galilei.

<text>Earnest Lee Hudson (born December 17, 1945) is an American actor. He is known for his role as Winston Zeddemore in the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise. Hudson has also acted in the films &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1989), &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; (1992), &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), &quot;Airheads&quot; (1994), &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (1995), &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Ron Clark Story&quot; (2006).

On television, his most prominent role was Warden Leo Glynn on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; (1997–2003). Hudson has also appeared in the television shows &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1984), &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; (1986), &quot;10-8: Officers on Duty&quot; (2003–2004), &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2006–2007), &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; (2008–2013), &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (2009–2010), the voice of Agent Bill Fowler in &quot;&quot; (2010–2013), &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot; (2012–2014), &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; (2015–2020), and &quot;L.A.&#x27;s Finest&quot; (2019–2020). From 2022 to 2024, Hudson appeared as Herbert &quot;Magic&quot; Williams on the NBC drama &quot;Quantum Leap.

==Early life==
Hudson was born on December 17, 1945, in Benton Harbor, Michigan. He never knew his father. His mother, Maggie Donald, died of tuberculosis when he was two months old. He was subsequently raised by his maternal grandmother, Arrana Donald.

Hudson joined the U.S. Marine Corps immediately after high school but was discharged after only three months on medical grounds due to asthma. Having moved to Detroit, he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest black theater company in the United States. He enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills, graduating in 1973. He established the Actors&#x27; Ensemble Theatre where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. He began a doctoral program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities before leaving to appear in a stage production of &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;. Later, he studied toward a Master of Fine Arts in acting at Yale School of Drama, but left after a year to appear in &quot;Leadbelly&quot;.

In an interview with Belief.net, Hudson stated that he is a practicing Christian, but does not believe that &quot;one church is the right one&quot;.

==Career==

One of Hudson&#x27;s early film roles is in &quot;Penitentiary II&quot; (1982) starring Leon Isaac Kennedy. He had various guest roles on television series such as &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;. He was on the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; in a first-season episode as a voodoo man named Jamu. Hudson gained fame playing Winston Zeddemore in the 1984 feature film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and its 1989 sequel, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;. He auditioned to reprise the role for the animated series, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, but it was given to Arsenio Hall. He had a major supporting role as the mentally challenged handyman Solomon in &quot;The Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot; (1992).

Hudson was cast as Warden Leo Glynn on HBO&#x27;s series &quot;Oz&quot;, and his son Ernie Hudson Jr. co-starred with him as Muslim inmate Hamid Khan. Hudson also appears as the character Munro in &quot;Congo&quot; (1995) and as Police Sergeant Albrecht in &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994). He switched gears when he played a preacher opening the eyes of a small town&#x27;s prejudice in the 1950s in &quot;A Stranger in the Kingdom&quot;. He played Harry McDonald, the FBI superior of Sandra Bullock&#x27;s character in the feature film &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000). He is in the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode &quot;Ethon&quot; as Pernaux. He appeared as Reggie in the 1995 film &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in the television film &quot;The Ron Clark Story&quot; as Principal Turner. In 2008, he began a recurring role as Dr. Fields on &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;. He had a recurring role on the final season of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; as Lt. Anita Van Buren&#x27;s boyfriend and then fiancé.

In 2011, he played Stuart Owens in &quot;&quot;.
Beginning in 2015, Hudson was cast in a recurring role as Jacob, an organic farmer who is the romantic interest for Frankie Bergstein (Lily Tomlin) in the series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;.

Hudson appeared in the 2016 &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; reboot, playing Bill Jenkins, the uncle of Leslie Jones&#x27;s lead character Pattie Tolan.

In 2019, Hudson began starring in &quot;L.A.&#x27;s Finest&quot;, playing the estranged father of Gabrielle Union&#x27;s character. Hudson called it &quot;a very different show&quot;, citing the duality of having to protect people as a member of law enforcement while having unresolved relationships that need to be reconciled. Spectrum canceled the series after two seasons the following year.

In August 2019, he confirmed his involvement in &quot;&quot; directed by Jason Reitman, joining original cast members Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Annie Potts. Hudson described himself as being welled by emotions after he put on his jumpsuit and proton pack, as he had previously &quot;accepted that [a film] was never going to happen&quot;.

Hudson appeared in the 2022 drama film &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, alongside Kate Beckinsale and Brian Cox.

On March 8, 2022, Hudson was announced as the co-lead in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; reboot.

In January 2023, Hudson guest voiced a character, Grini Millegi, a Dowutin gangster who was an associate of Cid and oversees Riot Racing on the planet Safa Toma, on &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hudson married his first wife, Jeannie Moore, in 1963, when she was sixteen and he was eighteen. They had two sons, Ernie Hudson Jr. and Rahaman Hudson. When Hudson and Jeannie divorced in 1976, their sons moved to live with Hudson in California. In 1985, Hudson married former flight attendant Linda Kingsberg, and they had two sons, Andrew and Ross.

On June 8, 2024, a portion of South Fair Avenue (M-139) near Hudson&#x27;s childhood home in Benton Harbor was given the honorary name &quot;Ernie Hudson Way&quot;.

<text>Charles Henry Hardin (July 15, 1820 – July 29, 1892) was an American attorney and politician who was Governor of Missouri served in the Missouri Senate and the Missouri House of Representatives. He founded Hardin College and was one of the eight founders of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

==Early life==
In 1820, Charles Henry Hardin was born to Charles and Hannah Jewell Hardin in Trimble County, Kentucky. Also in 1820, his family moved to Missouri and eventually settled in Columbia, Missouri. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1830, Hardin worked in the family&#x27;s tannery business.

Hardin began his secondary education in 1837 at the Indiana University Bloomington. He transferred to Miami University in 1839 and graduated in 1841. During his time at Miami University, he helped to found Beta Theta Pi fraternity. 

After college, he studied law with James M. Gordon in Columbia and passed the Bar.

== Career ==
Hardin opened a law practice in Fulton, Missouri in 1843. From 1848 to 1852, he was a circuit attorney for the Second Judicial Circuit of Missouri. He served in the Missouri House of Representatives, with terms starting in 1852, 1854, and 1858. He was a Democrat. He was a member of the commission that revised and codified the state&#x27;s statute laws.

In 1860, he was elected to the Missouri Senate 9th District, with a term lasting until 1862. As a state senator, he attended Claiborne Fox Jackson&#x27;s secessionist meeting in Neosho, Missouri and was the only senator present to vote against secession.

During the Civil War, he returned to the family farm in Audrain County, Missouri in 1862. After the war, Hardin and his family moved to Mexico, Missouri, where he established a new law practice and co-founded Mexico Southern Bank following the close of the war.

In 1872, Hardin was again elected to the state senate for a term lasting until 1874. In 1876, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Missouri.

He ran for governor of Missouri and was elected on November 5, 1874. He served as 22nd Governor of Missouri between January 1, 1875, and February 8, 1877. During his term, a new constitution was approved. Hardin also reduced Missouri&#x27;s debt from the Civil War and state funding for railroad expansion by ending wasteful practices and refinancing bonds. 

Hardin established Hardin College and Conservatory of Music in Mexico, Missouri. In 1873, Hardin gave land worth $60,000 to the college and afterward served as the president of its board.

== Personal life ==
Hardin married Mary Barr Jenkins in 1844.

Late in life, Hardin was in poor health. In 1892, he died from conditions relating to old age in Ringo House in Mexico, Missouri. He was initially buried in a private graveyard in Audrain County, Missouri, but was later re-buried at the Jewell family cemetery in Columbia, Missouri.

<doc id="834425" wikidata="Q6948426" url="?curid=834425" title="Myron Cope">
<text>Myron Sidney Kopelman (January 23, 1929 – February 27, 2008), known professionally as Myron Cope, was an American sports journalist, radio personality, and sportscaster. He is best known for being &quot;the voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers&quot;.

Cope was a color commentator for the Steelers&#x27; radio broadcasts for 35 years. He was known for his distinctive, higher-pitched nasally voice with an identifiable Pittsburgh accent, idiosyncratic speech pattern, and a level of excitement rarely exhibited in the broadcast booth. Cope&#x27;s most notable catch phrase was &quot;yoi&quot; . He helped popularize the Terrible Towel, a rally towel associated with the Steelers. In 1996, Cope gave the rights to the towel to Allegheny Valley School, which has received more than $6 million in proceeds from towel sales.

Cope was the first football announcer inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Cope&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Double Yoi!&quot;, was published in 2002.

== Education and career ==

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Jewish parents of Lithuanian ancestry, Cope graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1947 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2009. He also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh. 

Cope was originally a journalist before becoming a broadcaster. His first job as a journalist was in Erie, Pennsylvania, with the &quot;Daily Times&quot;, and by the summer of 1951, he was working for the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;. Cope then became a freelance journalist, most notably for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;. In 1963, Cope received the E.P. Dutton Prize for &quot;Best Magazine Sportswriting in the Nation&quot;, for a portrayal of Cassius Clay. Cope spent the 1983 college football season as a color analyst for the Pittsburgh Panthers. In 1987, he was named by the Hearst Corporation as a noted literary achiever, along with Mark Twain, Jack London, Frederic Remington, Walter Winchell, and Sidney Sheldon. At its 50th anniversary, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; selected Cope&#x27;s profile of Howard Cosell as one of the 50 best written works ever published in the magazine.

== Steelers broadcasting ==
In 1968, Cope began doing daily sports commentaries on what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh. His unique nasal voice, with a distinctive Pittsburgh area accent, was noticed by the Steelers&#x27; brass, and he made his debut as a member of the Steelers&#x27; radio team in 1970.

During Cope&#x27;s 35-year broadcasting career with the Steelers—the second longest term with a single team in NFL history, he was accompanied by only two play-by-play announcers: Jack Fleming, with whom he broadcast until 1994, and Bill Hillgrove.

In keeping with his comic personality, a series of television commentaries on WTAE-TV saw Cope calling himself &quot;Doctor Cope&quot; and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. His predictor was known as the &quot;Cope-ra-scope.&quot;

In his last seven years, Cope would work alongside former Steelers offensive tackle Tunch Ilkin in the booth and help groom him for his own broadcasting career. Ilkin, upon his own retirement in 2021 due to complications from ALS (which he would later die from on September 4, 2021), later joked that while he learned a lot from riding in the car with Cope for away games, Cope primarily rode with him because he allowed Cope to smoke cigarettes in the car. Ilkin would eventually serve as a de facto replacement for Cope following Cope&#x27;s retirement.

=== Catchphrases and nicknames ===
Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh, particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince, Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts, such as &quot;Mmm-Hah!&quot; (when he loses his train of thought, or forgets a player&#x27;s name) and &quot;Okel Dokel&quot; (his version of &quot;okey dokey&quot;). Cope often used Yiddish expressions, especially &quot;Feh!&quot; and &quot;Yoi!&quot; (sometimes multiplied as &quot;Double Yoi&quot; or rarely &quot;Triple Yoi&quot;).

Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams. It was Cope who popularized &quot;The Bus&quot; as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, &quot;Jack Splat&quot; for Jack Lambert, and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname &quot;Slash.&quot;

Cope also used the term &quot;Cincinnati Bungles&quot; to describe their division rivals, known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts. Myron also used terms such as &quot;Brownies&quot;, &quot;Birdies&quot;, &quot;Yonkos&quot;, &quot;Cryboys&quot;, and &quot;Redfaces&quot; for the football teams from Cleveland, Baltimore, Denver, Dallas, Washington, D.C., in respective order.

Cope was noted for accusing future Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente of being &quot;baseball&#x27;s champion hypochondriac&quot;.

== Terrible Towel ==

Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel. Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts, Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. Originally, Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks, but realizing the high costs for the masks, opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel. The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and &quot;is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team&quot;. The catchphrase is: &quot;The Terrible Towel is poised to strike, and so are The Steelers.&quot;

In 1996, Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. The school provides care for more than 900 people with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities, including Cope&#x27;s son who has severe autism. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $6 million for the school.

== Family life ==
Cope married Mildred Lindberg of Charleston in 1965, and the couple moved to Mt. Lebanon.
In 1972, the Copes moved to nearby Upper St. Clair. Mildred died on September 20, 1994. In 1999, Cope moved back to Mt. Lebanon, to a condo in the Woodridge neighborhood. He remained there until his final days, when he entered a Mt. Lebanon nursing home.

Cope had three children, Elizabeth, Martha Ann, and Daniel. Martha Ann died shortly after her birth. His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived most of his life at the Allegheny Valley School, an institution specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities. Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism, and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism.

== Retirement and death ==
Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20, 2005, citing health concerns. Eight days later, it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for &quot;long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football.&quot; Upon his retirement, the Steelers did not replace Cope, opting instead to downsize to a two-man broadcast team.

On October 31, 2005, Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens. In addition, the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it. As seen on the towel, production was limited to 35,000 towels, representing 35 years of service to the Steelers. Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL, many Steelers fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call &quot;The one for the thumb.&quot; Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement.

A longtime heavy smoker, Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt. Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27, 2008. In the days following his death, many ceremonies were held in his honor, including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team. Two days after his death, hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving. His funeral, which was held on February 29, 2008, was private. Due to Cope&#x27;s large impact on the Pittsburgh area, Bob Smizik, a local sportswriter wrote,

<doc id="834432" wikidata="Q3080542" url="?curid=834432" title="Jean Focas">
<text>Jean-Henri Focas (; 20 July 1909 – 3 January 1969) was a Greek-French astronomer, painter, designer, illustrator, astrophysicists, photographer, and celestial cartographer who spoke five languages. He performed visual studies of planetary surfaces from the National Observatory of Athens, Pic du Midi, and Meudon Great Refractor. Jean is responsible for creating the most highly visual map of Mars ever created by a visual observer of the planet. He developed special photographic equipment to photograph celestial phenomena. In 1961, he published &quot;Étude Photométrique et Polarimétrique des Phénomènes Saisonniers de la Planéte Mar (Photometric and Polarimetric Study of the Seasonal Phenomena of the Planet Mars)&quot; which became a classic on the subject of polarimetric investigation of Mars. A crater on the Moon and a crater on Mars were named after him because of his contribution to the field.

Jean was born on the Greek island of Corfu. When he was in high school he would frequently visit a small astronomical station on Kogevina hill in Corfu built by lunar photographer Félix Chemla Lamèch. Félix was impressed by Jean&#x27;s artistic abilities and Jean became his apprentice and began to learn about the field of astronomy firsthand. Félix taught him how to make complex astronomical observations. Jean&#x27;s impressive abilities garnered the attention of Greek astronomer Stavros Plakidis who recommended the young astronomer to the head of the National Observatory of Athens Demetrios Eginitis. Fokas became an assistant at the observatory around 1931. He began writing papers that were published internationally. World War II took a harsh toll on Greek astronomical research during the early 1940s. By the 1950s, Jean traveled back and forth to France. By the age of 45, he had become known within the international astronomical community.

While he was at the Pic du Midi he performed a photometric study from 663 negatives that he contributed to collecting himself which he used to determine 7200 different regions of the surfaces of different astronomical phenomena namely planets and moons. He was a member of the Société astronomique de France, French Academy of Sciences, and the International Astronomical Union and an advocate of the international collaboration of astronomy. He died prematurely of a heart attack while he was visiting Athens, Greece at 59 years old.

==History==
Fokas was born in Corfu. His father&#x27;s name was Errikos. Jean&#x27;s son also bears the same name. From a young age, Jean showed a fascination for astronomy. Luckily 
lunar photographer Félix Chemla Lamèch built a small astronomical station on Kogevina Hill in Corfu. Jean met Felix while he was still in high school and 
showed the astronomer his amazing artistic skills. He painted and drew incredibly detailed depictions of the major planets. Jean also began to make complex astronomical observations. He became Felix&#x27;s apprentice and learned about astronomy hands-on. Jean Focas became the general secretary of the Astronomical Society of Greece at 18 years of age. The society was started by Felix and based in Corfu. Eventually, the young astronomer was introduced to Stavros Plakidis around 1931.

Plakidis recommended Fokas to Demetrios Eginitis the then-head of the National Observatory of Athens. Fokas impressed both astronomers and was hired as an assistant at the observatory. The astronomer spent a large portion of his life at the observatory learning from Plakidis, Eginitis, and the other astronomers associated with the observatory. He wrote papers and continued his complex artistic rendering of different elements in the solar system such as sunspots, variable stars, comets, and mainly the terrain of various planets. He wrote an article in 1937 entitled &quot;Observations of Saturn&#x27;s Rings&quot;. While he was at the Athens observatory he designed complex instrumentation. One such instrument was a camera made of plywood and black velvet used to photograph images seen through the telescope.
During the late 1930s, Plakidis lobbied to move the astronomical station to Penteli which began functioning in 1937. Regrettably, when the Nazis invaded Greece most of the instrumentation of the observatories were dismantled and hidden from the Third Reich. After the war Focas wrote &quot;La Planète Saturne (The Planet Saturn)&quot; in 1948. By the early fifties, he continued his research in astrophysics and wrote a paper on the polarized light of the Moon during the total lunar eclipse of January 29–30, 1953, in Athens which was presented by André Danjon to the French Academy of Sciences. One year later in 1954, he traveled to South France at the Pyrenees Mountains to view astronomical subject matter at the newly built 60 cm telescope of the Pic du Midi Observatory. About ten years later, the same facility was used by NASA to prep for the Apollo Moon landing. When he returned to Athens he introduced new photographic, polarimetric, and micrometric observation methods developed in the French observatories.

By this point, Focas traveled to France once a year using the Observatory of Meudon working in collaboration with the National Observatory of Athens. He also continued visiting various observatories all over France. By 1961, 
he was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Paris for his thesis entitled &quot;Étude Photométrique et Polarimétrique des Phénomènes Saisonniers de la Planéte Mars (Photometric and Polarimetric Study of the Seasonal Phenomena of the Planet Mars)&quot;.

In early 1964, he traveled to Arizona to visit the Lowell Observatory. He assessed all the plates collected by American astronomer Earl C. Slipher and closely participated in the coordinated operations carried out by the International Astronomical Union collaborating with both the American and French observatories to build two planetary photographic centers at the Lowell and Meudon observatories. That same year Stavros Plakidis retired and according to Fokas&#x27; son Errikos his father had a disagreement with the leadership at the National Observatory of Athens and Fokas permanently moved to France. By this period Fokas carried out more than a thousand photometric measurements on Jupiter, which formed the basis of his work on the long-term evolution of cloud formations in the upper atmosphere of the planet.

Throughout his life, Focas focused on mastering the use of the equatorial and the meridian telescopes, micrometer, celestial photometry and astro photographic equipment. He built on the work of his predecessors Evgenios Antoniadis and Bernard Lyot. He has been honored by countless institutions around the world. Regrettably, he died prematurely at age 59 on 3 January 1969 from a heart attack while in Greece, where he was visiting for the holidays. His biography was written by one of his mentors&#x27; French astronomer Audouin Dollfus. Craters on the Moon and Mars were named after Jean, namely the Focas lunar crater in the southern hemisphere of the Moon, with a diameter of 22 km, as well as the Focas Martian crater in the northern hemisphere of Mars with a diameter of 76.5 km.

<doc id="834433" wikidata="Q5519329" url="?curid=834433" title="Gals Panic">
<text>is a series of Japanese eroge (adult video games) by Kaneko for the arcades. The gameplay in the &quot;Gals Panic&quot; series is similar to Taito&#x27;s classic puzzle game &quot;Qix&quot;; the objective is to control a marker on a board and uncover backgrounds, which depict women in a sexual nature who progressively strip to nudity. Many clones of &quot;Gals Panic&quot; were made after the original game achieved popularity in the 1990s.

== &quot;Gals Panic&quot; ==
In the first game, the round is over when the at least 80% of the silhouette is uncovered. The Japanese girls in the background, which are photographs or drawings, undresses in the filled-in areas, while on the playing area one large and several small enemies hinder the undressing process. There are various symbols as bonuses. In addition to useful effects such as the asteroid storm that is used for defeating enemy sprites, there are also loser symbols that can transform the girl into a frog or octopus. There is also a bonus game.

The six models that appear in the game are: Marina Matsumoto, Ayami Kida, Nami Ozawa, Yuki Miho, Emi Nakahara, and Shiori Asano. 

&quot;Gals Panic&quot; was released in November 1990 published by Taito and was released by Kaneko USA in America in March 1991. The U.S. version has some censorship such as placing bras on the girl during round three instead of being topless. 

== &quot;Gals Panic II&quot; ==

&quot;Gals Panic II&quot; was released in 1993 with a number of enhancements, including an eight-way joystick, stereo audio and the Card Dispenser option. The gauge is now changed to a time-based one. An alternate version was also released subtitled &quot;Quiz Mode&quot; which features an additional gameplay element of a quiz presented by each girl. A &quot;Special Version&quot; was later released with improved graphics and other changes.

Mainichi Communications released a Windows 95 and PC-98 version for Japanese home computers in December 1996, distributed via bookstores, under the name &quot;Gal Pani II&quot;.

== &quot;Gals Panic 3&quot; ==
&quot;Gals Panic 3&quot; was released in October 1995 and runs on the Super Kaneko Nova System hardware, on which all future arcade &quot;Gals Panic&quot; games would be built on. The drawings of the girls are more realistic than before.

== &quot;Gals Panic 4, SS,&quot; and &quot;Silhouette Stories&quot; ==

&quot;Gals Panic 4&quot;, also known as &quot;Gals Panic for you&quot;, was released in 1996 on the Super Kaneko Nova System. From this title onwards, the girls that appear in &quot;Gals Panic&quot; games are in manga or anime style, although this game is tamer and there are no topless girls in it. The same year came &quot;Gals Panic SS&quot;, an expanded port of the fourth game released for the Sega Saturn home console in Japan in 1996. &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored the game 25/40. On the very same day, Kaneko released &quot;Silhouette Stories&quot; on PlayStation, which does not contain any stripping or explicit elements, but does have a story mode; &quot;Famitsu&quot; rated this game 23/40.

== &quot;Gals Panic S, S2, S3&quot; ==

The &quot;S&quot; series had key differences in gameplay and was intended for a different market than before. &quot;Gals Panic S: Special Edition&quot; (1997) restored topless characters, adds scrolling screens and has more powerful bosses. It was followed by &quot;Gals Panic S 2&quot; (1999), as well as a non-explicit version called &quot;Panic Street&quot; (1999). As Kaneko was struggling financially and exited the market, the follow-up and final official game, &quot;Gals Panic S 3&quot; (2002), was published by Able Corporation.

==Clones and similar games==

Games by other companies that itself cloned or at least imitated &quot;Gals Panic&quot; include Namco&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Eyes&quot;, &quot;Lady Killer&quot; by Mitchell Corporation, numerous titles from South Korean Comad such as &quot;Gals Pinball&quot; and &quot;Miss World&quot;, &quot;Gal Pani X&quot; by To Heart, and in more recent times, &quot;Pretty Girls Panic!&quot;.

<text>Josef Ganz (1 July 1898 – 26 July 1967) was a Jewish-German car designer born in Budapest, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Hungary).

==Early years==
Josef Ganz was born on 1 July 1898 into a Jewish family living in Budapest, then the second-largest city within Austria-Hungary. His mother was Maria Török (1872–1926) from Hungary. His father was Hugo Markus Ganz (1862–1922) from Mainz in Germany who worked as a political and literary writer and journalist for the Frankfurter Zeitung. At an early age, Josef Ganz was fascinated by technology. After moving from Budapest to Vienna, the family moved to Frankfurt am Main in Germany in 1916 and took on German nationality. In July 1916, Ganz voluntarily enlisted in the German army and fought in the German navy during the First World War. After the war, in 1918, Josef Ganz resumed his mechanical engineering studies at the Technische Hochschule Wien. After three semesters, he switched to the Technische Universität Darmstadt. He completed his studies in 1927. During this period, he became inspired with the idea of building a small car for the price of a motorcycle.



==Prototypes and the Standard Superior==
In 1923, as a young mechanical engineering student, Ganz made his first auto sketches for a car for the masses. This was a small lightweight car along the lines of the Rumpler Tropfenwagen with a mid-mounted engine, independent wheel suspension, swing-axles and an aerodynamic body. Lacking the money to build a prototype, he began publishing articles on progressive car design in various magazines and, shortly after his graduation in 1927, he was assigned as the new editor-in-chief of Klein-Motor-Sport. Josef Ganz used this magazine as a platform to criticize heavy, unsafe and old-fashioned cars and promote innovative design and his concept of a car for Germany&#x27;s general population. The magazine gained in reputation and influence and, in January 1929, was renamed Motor-Kritik. Contributors to the magazine included Béla Barényi, a young engineering student who designed cars with similar design.

Post-war Volkswagen director Heinrich Nordhoff later said &quot;Josef Ganz in Motor-Kritik attacked the old and well-established auto companies with biting irony and with the ardent conviction of a missionary.&quot; Companies in turn fought against &quot;Motor-Kritik&quot; with lawsuits, slander campaigns and an advertising boycott. Publicity for the magazine and Josef Ganz increased.

In 1929, Josef Ganz started contacting German motorcycle manufacturers Zündapp, Ardie and DKW for collaboration to build a prototype, small people&#x27;s car. This resulted in a first prototype, the Ardie-Ganz, built at Ardie in 1930 and a second one completed at Adler in May 1931, which was nicknamed the Maikäfer (‘May-Beetle’, common European cockchafer &quot;Melolontha melolontha&quot;). News about the prototypes spread through the industry. At Adler, Josef Ganz was assigned as a consultant engineer at Daimler-Benz and BMW where he was involved in the development of the first models with independent wheel suspension: the Mercedes-Benz 170 and BMW AM1 (Automobilkonstruktion München 1).

The first company to build a car according to the many patents of Josef Ganz was the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, which introduced its Standard Superior model at the IAMA (Internationale Auto- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear. Here the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler expressed interest in its design and low selling price of . Under the new anti-Semitic government, however, Josef Ganz was a target for his enemies from the automotive industry that opposed his writings in Motor-Kritik.

==Influence on Porsche==

After news about the results achieved with the Ardie-Ganz and Adler Maikäfer prototypes reached Zündapp, the company turned to Ferdinand Porsche in September 1931 to develop an &quot;Auto für Jedermann&quot;—a &quot;car for everyman&quot;. Porsche already preferred the flat-4 cylinder engine, as was also tried out by Daimler-Benz under supervision of Josef Ganz almost a year previous, but Zündapp preferred a watercooled 5-cylinder radial engine. In 1932, three prototypes were running. All of those cars were lost during the war, the last in a bombing raid over Stuttgart in 1945.

The influence of Ganz on the design of the Volkswagen Beetle is a matter of dispute.

==Arrest==
Josef Ganz himself was arrested by the Gestapo in May 1933 based on falsified charges of blackmail of the automotive industry. He was eventually released. He fled Germany in June 1934 – the month Adolf Hitler assigned Ferdinand Porsche to design a mass-producible auto for a consumer price of 1,000 Reichsmark.

After a short period in Liechtenstein, Josef Ganz settled in Switzerland where with government support he started a Swiss auto project. In Germany production of the Standard Superior and the Bungartz Butz ended. The first prototypes of the Swiss auto were constructed in 1937 and 1938 and plans were formed for mass-production inside a new factory. After the start of World War II, however, Ganz was again under threat from the Gestapo and Swiss government officials who claimed the Swiss auto project as their own. After the war, a small number of Swiss autos were built by the Rapid car company. Ganz took the Swiss to court.

After five years of court battles, Ganz left Switzerland in 1949 and settled in France. Here he worked on a new small car, but could no longer compete with the Volkswagen.

In 1951 Josef Ganz emigrated to Australia. For some years he worked there for General Motors – Holden, but suffered ill health after a series of heart attacks in the early 1960s.

In 1965 the Federal Republic of Germany sought Australian Government permission to bestow on Josef Ganz the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. However under regulations existing at that time in relation to foreign awards to Australian citizens, the request was denied.

Josef Ganz died in obscurity in Australia, residing at Edgewater Towers, St Kilda, Melbourne.

<doc id="834440" wikidata="Q1255835" url="?curid=834440" title="Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque">
<text>Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque (, ) is a mosque in the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Built in the 16th century, it is the largest historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the most representative Ottoman structures in the Balkans. Having been Sarajevo&#x27;s central mosque since the days of its construction, today it also serves as the main congregational mosque of the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the Baščaršija neighborhood in the Stari Grad municipality and, being one of the main architectural monuments in the town, is regularly visited by tourists.

==History==

The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque was built in 1530 as the central object of the Beg&#x27;s endowment, which also included a maktab and a madrasa (Islamic primary and secondary schools), a bezistan (vaulted marketplace), a hammam (public bathplace) etc. The foundation of this waqf by the contemporary Ottoman governor of Bosnia had a crucial point in the development of the town. The architect&#x27;s name is unknown, but after some speculations, which even included famous Mimar Sinan as an option, most scholars agreed that Acem Esir Ali &quot;Alaüddin&quot;, an Ottoman mimar of Persian ancestry, is the most probable builder. It is still possible that Sinan himself did inspect the work on the spot, since he was in the region at the time. Historical documents testify that Ragusan masons, requested from their government by Gazi Husrev-beg, participated in the building process.

Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque was the first mosque in the world to receive electricity and electric illumination in 1898 during the period of Austro-Hungarian Empire.

==Architecture==

The mosque belongs to the type of complex-spaced, multi-domed mosques and it is a represent of the Early Period of Classical Ottoman Architecture (sometimes referred to as Early Istanbul Style). The central rectangular space, framed by high walls and covered with a dome resting on pendentives, represents the spine of the structure, while lower extensions lean to it and expand the volume of the interior space. The qibla side of the mosque is extended with a rectangular space which is covered by a semi-dome resting on two highly developed muqarnas structures. They stand in function of pendentives, reducing the rectangular outline of the ground level to the near semi-circle shape in level of the semi-dome. This area houses central architectural elements with religious purposes: mihrab, minbar and kursi and, being open to the central space with a huge arch, represents the focal point of the mosque. Two smaller spaces, called tetime (sg. tetima) are located on the left and right sides of the central space, placed furthest from the Kibla side. They are covered by two lower domes resting on pendentives.

The exterior is dominated by the main dome, topped out only by a simple, yet monumental minaret. The entry side is marked with a portico resting on four wide columns and covered with little domes, only the central one, above the portal, being a bit greater than others, and resting on muqarnas-adorned pendentives, in contrast to others which are laid on simple, plain-surfaced pendentives. The monumental portal is richly decorated with muqarnas, as well as columns&#x27; capitals.
In his legacy, he stated: &quot;Good deeds drive away evil, and one of the most worthy of good deeds is the act of charity, and the most worthy act of charity is one which lasts forever. Of all charitable deeds, the most beautiful is one that continually renews itself.&quot;

=== Destruction and reconstruction ===

During the Siege of Sarajevo, Serbian forces purposely targeted many centers of the city&#x27;s culture, such as museums, libraries, and mosques, and fired on them generally. As the largest and best known, the Beg&#x27;s mosque was an obvious target.
Having suffered a significant amount of destruction, the reconstruction of the Mosque started with foreign - mainly Saudi - aid in 1996, right after the war. The old and faded layer of Austro-Hungarian decoration was removed and, since remains of older, historical layers of decorative painting weren&#x27;t found, a completely new interior was designed and applied by Bosnian calligrapher Hazim Numanagić in 2001/2002. Austro-Hungarian decoration, performed mostly in pseudo-Moorish style, remains only on the portal of the Mosque today.

<doc id="834465" wikidata="Q706068" url="?curid=834465" title="Fernando de la Cerda (1255–1275)">
<text>Ferdinand de la Cerda (23 October 1255 – 25 June 1275) was the heir apparent to the Crown of Castile as the eldest son of Alfonso X and Violant of Aragon. His nickname, &quot;de la Cerda&quot;, means &quot;of the bristle&quot; in Spanish. There are various accounts of the origin of this name, including that it was a reference to being born with a full head of hair or that he was born with a hairy mole, resembling a bristle or mane, on his chest or back according to different accounts.

Arms of the [[Fernando de la Cerda (1255–1275)|[[House de la Cerda]]]] to the 13th century, a combination of Castile and León, from &quot;infante&quot; Fernando, and the arms of France, for Blanche of France.

In November 1268 Ferdinand married Blanche, the daughter of King Louis IX of France. They had two sons:

* Alfonso de la Cerda (1270-1333), who was believed to have married Matilde of Narbonne, daughter of Viscount Aimery VI of Narbonne. Recent research showed that Alfonso de la Cerda married Matilde of Brienne, daughter of John I of Brienne. They had four sons and three daughters.
* Fernando de la Cerda (1275-1322), who married Juana Núñez de Lara, called &quot;la Palomilla&quot;, Lady of Lara &amp; Herrera, daughter of Juan Núñez de Lara “el Mayor” and Teresa Álvarez de Azagra. They had one son and three daughters. One daughter, Blanca Núñez de Lara, was the mother-in-law to King Henry II of Castile.

Ferdinand became regent of Castile in November 1274 when his father left for Germany. In May 1275 the Marinids from Morocco landed in Spain upon call from Muhammad II of Granada and attacked Castile. Ferdinand raised troops and moved south from Burgos to defend the kingdom but died unexpectedly in Villa Real on 25 June 1275 leaving Castile open to invasion. His sons did not inherit the throne of their grandfather, since their uncle Sancho, who had repulsed the Moorish invasion, usurped the throne.

<text>Georges Fournier (21 November 1881 – 1 December 1954) was a French astronomer.

He observed the planet Mars with great detail. In 1909 he was credited with discovering clouds on the planet. During the campaign to observe Mercury between 1924 and 1929, he was the only experienced observer who doubted the deduced rotational period. It later (in 1965) turned out to be incorrect.

A crater on Mars was named in his honor.

<text>Key is a Japanese visual novel studio known for making dramatic and plot-oriented titles. It was formed on July 21, 1998, as a brand under the publisher Visual Arts, and is located in Kita, Osaka.

Key&#x27;s debut visual novel &quot;Kanon&quot; (1999) combined an elaborate storyline, up-to-date anime-style art, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key&#x27;s second game, &quot;Air&quot; (2000), had a similarly complex storyline to &quot;Kanon&quot; and a more thorough gameplay. Both &quot;Kanon&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; were originally produced as adult games, but this trend was broken with Key&#x27;s third title &quot;Clannad&quot; (2004), released for all ages. Key has released 18 visual novels to date, the latest being &quot;Stella of The End&quot; (2022). Key has worked in the past with Interchannel and Prototype for the consumer port releases of the brand&#x27;s games. Key has collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce three original anime series: &quot;Angel Beats!&quot; (2010), &quot;Charlotte&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Day I Became a God&quot; (2020). The crossover anime series &quot;Kaginado&quot; premiered in 2021. The multimedia project &quot;Prima Doll&quot; includes an anime series that aired in 2022, and a four-volume visual novel series.

Co-founder Jun Maeda is a prominent figure in the brand, having contributed to the planning, scenario, and music composition in the majority of Key&#x27;s visual novels. Na-Ga, Key&#x27;s main artist, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but with Key&#x27;s sixth game &quot;Little Busters!&quot; (2007) was given the position of co-art director with former Key artist Itaru Hinoue. Shinji Orito, Key&#x27;s main composer and another co-founder, has composed music for the majority of Key&#x27;s titles.

Key has been an active participant at the Comiket convention since Comiket 57 in 1999, where they sold &quot;Kanon&quot;-related products; Key&#x27;s latest appearance at Comiket was at Comiket 99 in 2021. In 2001, Visual Arts created the record label Key Sounds Label to release music albums and singles with music related to Key&#x27;s visual novels. Between 2007 and 2010, Key produced an Internet radio show called &quot;Key Net Radio&quot; in regard to the brand.

==History==
Before forming Key, the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called Nexton under the brand Tactics. At the time of &quot;Dōsei&quot;&#x27;s production, Tactics&#x27; first game, four of Key&#x27;s original staff worked on the game: Itaru Hinoue as art director, Shinji Orito as musical composer, and Miracle Mikipon and Shinory contributing to the computer graphics. After &quot;Dōsei&quot;, the rest of Key&#x27;s founding staff—Naoki Hisaya, Jun Maeda and OdiakeS—joined Tactics and contributed to two more games: &quot;Moon&quot; released on November 21, 1997, and &quot;&quot; released on May 29, 1998. Due to differing opinions between Nexton and most of the production staff in Tactics on how to produce the brand&#x27;s next game, most of Tactics&#x27; staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game.

Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at Visual Arts once before, introduced Key&#x27;s founding members to the president of Visual Arts, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to Visual Arts where they formed Key on July 21, 1998. With the production of Key&#x27;s debut title &quot;Kanon&quot; still in its early stages, a brand name had still not been decided on by the developers. The tentative brand name was at first, but Jun Maeda was not pleased with this and wanted a name that would capture the image of the brand. Maeda came upon the name Key when he saw it on a sign for a musical instrument store he would always pass on his way to work and instantly liked the name. The name Key for the studio was ultimately decided by majority rule. Key released &quot;Kanon&quot; on June 4, 1999, as an adult game, though the scenes containing adult content were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters&#x27; stories and on the visuals and music, especially for a visual novel at the time of its release. A year later, on September 8, 2000, Key released their second game &quot;Air&quot;, which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to &quot;Kanon&quot;.

Key&#x27;s third game &quot;Clannad&quot; is a visual novel similar to Key&#x27;s previous games, but contains no adult content. &quot;Clannad&quot; was meant to be released in 2002, but was delayed, leading to the game finally being released on April 28, 2004. Seven months after &quot;Clannad&quot;&#x27;s release, Key released their shortest game, &quot;&quot;, on November 29, 2004 with a rating for all ages. &quot;Planetarian&quot;, in contrast to Key&#x27;s past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make choices during gameplay; this is what is referred to as a kinetic novel. The brand&#x27;s fifth game is &quot;Tomoyo After: It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, an adult game and spin-off of &quot;Clannad&quot; released on November 25, 2005, which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami from &quot;Clannad&quot;. Key released their sixth game, &quot;Little Busters!&quot;, on July 27, 2007 with no adult content, but released another version of the game entitled &quot;Little Busters! Ecstasy&quot; on July 25, 2008, with added adult content, story, and visuals.

In commemoration of Key&#x27;s ten-year anniversary, Key and Visual Arts held a two-day event between February 28 and March 1, 2009, called &quot;Key 10th Memorial Fes: . Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series &quot;Angel Beats!&quot; that aired between April and June 2010. Key&#x27;s eighth game &quot;Kud Wafter&quot; was released on June 25, 2010, as an adult spin-off of &quot;Little Busters!&quot;, which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Kudryavka Noumi from &quot;Little Busters!&quot; and &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. Key released their ninth game &quot;Rewrite&quot; on June 24, 2011, with a rating for all ages, and an all ages fan disc to &quot;Rewrite&quot; titled &quot;Rewrite Harvest festa!&quot; was released on July 27, 2012. In commemoration of Key&#x27;s 15-year anniversary, the visual novel adaptation &quot;Angel Beats! 1st Beat&quot; was released on June 26, 2015. Key again collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series &quot;Charlotte&quot; that aired between July and September 2015. Key released the kinetic novel &quot;Harmonia&quot; on September 23, 2016, and it was available in English before its Japanese release on December 29, 2016. Key released the visual novel &quot;Summer Pockets&quot; on June 29, 2018; an expanded version titled &quot;Summer Pockets Reflection Blue&quot; was released on June 26, 2020. Key collaborated for a third time with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series &quot;The Day I Became a God&quot; that aired between October and December 2020.

Key announced the development of three kinetic novels in October 2020: &quot;Loopers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Stella of The End&quot;. &quot;Loopers&quot; was released on May 28, 2021. &quot;Lunaria: Virtualized Moonchild&quot; was released on December 24, 2021. &quot;Stella of The End&quot; was released on September 30, 2022. Key also revealed in October 2020 the multimedia project &quot;Prima Doll&quot; in collaboration with plastic model and figurine manufacturer Kotobukiya. A 12-episode anime television series for &quot;Prima Doll&quot; aired between July and September 2022. Key released the &quot;Planterian Ultimate Edition&quot; on September 3, 2021, which also included &quot;Planetarian: Snow Globe&quot;, a kinetic novel version of the previously released prequel short story of the same name. Key collaborated with video game developer Wright Flyer Studios to produce the mobile role-playing game &quot;Heaven Burns Red&quot; released on February 10, 2022 for iOS and Android devices. A four-volume kinetic novel series for &quot;Prima Doll&quot; began with volume one released on April 28, 2023. Volume two will be released on May 31, 2024. Key announced a new visual novel named &quot;Anemoi&quot; on November 15, 2023. A new kinetic novel titled set for release in 2024 was announced on December 15, 2023.

===Key Sounds Label===

In 2001, Visual Arts created the record label Key Sounds Label (KSL). The music albums and singles released by Key after this were put under this label, meaning that this does not include the first two albums and one single which were released before it was officially formed. The first album on this label was &quot;Humanity...&quot;, though the only direct connection to Key&#x27;s works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to &quot;Air&quot;. The albums under the label are mainly composed by Key&#x27;s signature composers: Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi. Three of the singles feature songs sung by Lia and one album, &quot;Love Song&quot;, features the singer Riya from Eufonius. Three drama CDs have been released as well.

To celebrate Key&#x27;s ten-year anniversary, Key hosted a concert called KSL Live World 2008: Way to the Little Busters! EX on May 10, 2008, in Tokyo, Japan, and again on May 17, 2008, in Osaka, Japan. Each time, the concert lasted for two and a half hours and featured songs sung by Lia, Rita, Chata, and Tomoe Tamiyasu who have previously sung songs for singles and albums released under Key Sounds Label. Another concert called KSL Live World 2010: Way to the Kud-Wafter was held in Tokyo between May 21–22, 2010. A third content called KSL Live World 2013: Way to the Little Busters! Refrain was held in Koto, Tokyo on September 16, 2013. A fourth concert called KSL Live World: Way to the Angel Beats! -1st- was held in Akihabara, Tokyo on April 11 and April 12, 2015. A fifth concert called KSL Live World 2016: The Animation Charlotte &amp; Rewrite was held in Toyosu, Tokyo on April 30, 2016.

===Key Net Radio===

Key produced 30 episodes of an Internet radio show called in regard to the brand between December 13, 2007 and August 30, 2010. It was hosted by Shinji Orito and Itaru Hinoue of Key, and another woman named Chiro who works for Pekoe, another visual novel studio under Visual Arts. Listeners could submit thoughts about the show and any requests they may have for the show, along with submitting questions to the host trio. The broadcasts were available via download on Key&#x27;s official website and were available for download on the radio show&#x27;s official blog for the first nine broadcasts. The broadcasts could also be listened to on Visual Arts&#x27; YouTube channel named Visual Channel.

For the first six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening greetings from the hosts and went on to thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.

===Comiket involvement===
Comiket, short for Comic Market, is a large comic convention held twice a year in Tokyo, Japan during August and December, which are referred to as the summer and winter Comic Markets, respectively. Key has been an active participant in the convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999, where they sold &quot;Kanon&quot;-related products (as &quot;Kanon&quot; was their only release at the time); one such product was a Zippo lighter. The first &quot;Air&quot;-related products Key sold at the convention were at Comiket 59 in December 2000. Typical products include: postcards, telephone cards, calendars, posters, and albums. The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the brand produces.

Key, through Visual Arts, generally participates at the winter Comiket in conjunction with other brands under Visual Arts, but has been known to appear at the summer Comiket too, such as with Comiket 70 in August 2006 where they sold &quot;&quot; related products. The combined total of the products Key sells at a given Comiket range in price between 3,000 and 5,000 yen. This includes the selling of music albums released under Key&#x27;s record label Key Sounds Label which has been releasing albums since Comiket 60 in August 2001 with the release of the label&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Humanity...&quot; and &quot;Natsukage / Nostalgia&quot;. If there are any unsold products by the end of a given Comiket, Visual Arts has been known to set up an online mail order to sell the remaining goods from all the brands under Visual Arts that participated at Comiket. After Comiket 73 in December 2007, Visual Arts started taking mail orders on March 4, 2008, and only six days later on March 10, 2008, Key reported that all of Key&#x27;s goods sold at Comiket 73 were now sold out. At the end of the second day of Comiket 75 in December 2008, all of Key&#x27;s goods at the convention were sold out.

==Staff==
===Main===
Key&#x27;s main staff members are attached to the visual novel studio, and therefore Visual Arts. One of the founding members of Key, Jun Maeda, has worked on the planning for the individual projects and was one of the main scenario writers; he has also composed music for the majority of Key&#x27;s games. Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer after &quot;Little Busters! Ecstasy&quot;, but continues to work on the music for Key&#x27;s games. However, Maeda designed the &quot;Angel Beats! 1st Beat&quot; visual novel and partially wrote its scenario, in addition to providing the original concept for &quot;Summer Pockets&quot;. Na-Ga, Key&#x27;s main artist, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but was first given the position of co-art director with former Key artist Itaru Hinoue with &quot;Little Busters!&quot;. Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by Shinory and Mochisuke, two graphic artists in Key. Shinji Orito, another founding member and Key&#x27;s main composer, has composed music for the majority of Key&#x27;s games.

===Former and outsourced===
Many of Key&#x27;s staff have left the brand over time, or have been employed as outsourced contributors. Naoki Hisaya had worked as one of the main scenario writers for &quot;Kanon&quot;, but once the project was complete, he left the brand. Another member of the staff that made &quot;Kanon&quot; was OdiakeS, an outsourced composer who has since helped Key with two music albums, one each released for &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Clannad&quot;, but has done nothing with Key since 2004. Three staff members only worked with Key on &quot;Air&quot;: Takashi Ishikawa as one of the scenario writers, Tomotaka Fujii as a scenario assistant, and Din as a background artist. &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Clannad&quot; had Tōya Okano and Kai who contributed as scenario writers. Kai later headed the planning of &quot;Kud Wafter&quot;, as well as contributing on the scenario of &quot;Angel Beats&quot;, &quot;Harmonia&quot; and &quot;Summer Pockets&quot;. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle Mikipon, left after &quot;Clannad&quot;. Two other outsourced graphic artists, Minimo Tayama and Torino, have often contributed on Key&#x27;s games. Scenario writer Yūichi Suzumoto worked with Key between &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Planetarian&quot;. Eeji Komatsu worked as the art director for &quot;Planetarian&quot;, and another artist, Fumio, worked as the art director for &quot;Tomoyo After&quot;.

Leo Kashida worked as an outsourced writer with Key on &quot;Tomoyo After&quot;, &quot;Little Busters!&quot; and &quot;Angel Beats&quot;. Chika Shirokiri, another outsourced writer who worked with Key on &quot;Little Busters!&quot;, also wrote the scenario for &quot;Kud Wafter&quot;. Manack and members of PMMK composed music in &quot;Little Busters!&quot;, and members of MintJam helped with arrangement. Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before &quot;Kanon&quot;″s release, working as one of the signature composers, but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of &quot;Little Busters!&quot;. Jun&#x27;ichi Shimizu composed all the music in &quot;Kud Wafter&quot;. Two outsourced writers worked on the scenario for &quot;Rewrite&quot; and its fan disc &quot;Rewrite Harvest festa!&quot;: Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, and Romeo Tanaka. &quot;Rewrite&quot; and &quot;Harvest festa!&quot; also featured three outsourced musical composers: Maiko Iuchi of I&#x27;ve Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Mizutsuki later returned to compose music for &quot;Harmonia&quot; and &quot;Summer Pockets&quot;. At the time Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer, Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on the scenario in &quot;Little Busters!&quot;. Tonokawa later contributed to the scenario in &quot;Rewrite&quot; and &quot;Harvest festa!&quot;, but resigned from Key in 2015. Itaru Hinoue, one of Key&#x27;s founding members, was Key&#x27;s main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for six of Key&#x27;s games. Hinoue resigned from Key in September 2016 after working on &quot;Harmonia&quot;.

==Impact==

According to Satoshi Todome&#x27;s work, &quot;A History of Adult Games&quot;, Key&#x27;s impact on the visual novel (primarily the adult game variant) world stems from before Key was formed and most of the founding members of Key worked for Tactics under Nexton. Due to an influence by Leaf&#x27;s visual novel &quot;To Heart&quot; released in 1997, the developers at Tactics created a simple formula for a game: a comedic first half with a heart-warming romantic middle followed by a tragic separation and finally an emotional reunion formed what is known as a &quot;crying game&quot; or &quot;nakige&quot;. The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters and make them cry due to emotional scenarios which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over. Tactics&#x27; second title &quot;&quot; was created based on this formula.

After &quot;One&quot; was complete, the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title &quot;Kanon&quot; also based upon this formula. &quot;Kanon&quot; was &quot;heavily hyped [and] had gamers impatient until its release. It was only one game released by Key so far, and yet [it] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry. And yet another game [&quot;Air&quot;], two years later, sent even more shockwaves. &quot;Air&quot; was equally hyped and well received.&quot; The success of &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Kanon&quot; on Key&#x27;s formula to create a &quot;crying game&quot; was later adopted by other visual novel developing companies which were influenced by this formula. Examples of this include: &quot;&quot; by Digital Object, the &quot;Memories Off&quot; series by KID, &quot;D.C.: Da Capo&quot; by Circus, &quot;Snow&quot; by Studio Mebius (also under Visual Arts), and &quot;&quot; by Minori.

Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion wrote in 2004 how he was influenced by Key&#x27;s works during the planning of &quot;Higurashi no Naku Koro ni&quot;. Ryukishi07 played Key&#x27;s games as a reference, among other visual novels, and analyzed them to figure out the reason why they were found to be so popular. He figured that the secret was due to how the stories would start with ordinary, enjoyable days, but then a sudden occurrence would happen leading the player to cry due to the shock value. He used a similar model for the basis of &quot;Higurashi&quot; but instead of leading the player to cry, Ryukishi07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of horror elements. In this way, Ryukishi07 wished to be in some way associated with Key who he described as a &quot;masterpiece maker&quot;.

Key is one of 17 brands under Visual Arts with games included in the &quot;Lycèe Trading Card Game&quot; published by Broccoli. Characters from Key&#x27;s first five games through &quot;Tomoyo After&quot; were included in the first three out of four Visual Arts card sets, and characters from &quot;Little Busters!&quot; through &quot;Rewrite&quot; were featured in the fifth through seventh Visual Arts card sets. There are also numerous rare promotional cards with characters from Key titles. Other big-name visual novel companies included in the card game include: AliceSoft, August, Leaf, Navel, and Type-Moon.

===Leaf, Key BBS===
A bulletin board system (BBS) based on the interface of the large Japanese Internet forum 2channel (2ch) was formed on January 26, 2000, named , otherwise nicknamed as . The board originated from 2ch&#x27;s video game discussion board due to a dispute involving the game &quot;Kizuato&quot; in December 1999; &quot;Kizuato&quot; was an early game of another visual novel producing brand named Leaf. Ultimately, fans of the game moved to 2ch&#x27;s adult game board, but there was not much resolution, and at the time Key fans on the board were being shunned for discussions on &quot;Kanon&quot; and, at the time, Key&#x27;s upcoming game &quot;Air&quot;. This resulted finally with the Leaf and Key fans moving away from 2ch and forming again on the PINKchannel Internet forum. The board serves as a discussion board for anything related to Leaf and Key. This includes the games the companies produce, but also the companies themselves and the staff that make up those companies. The BBS gets approximately 900 posts per day as of March 2010. Like 2ch, the board has a default anonymous posting setting, and the default name is , a reference to the heroine from &quot;&quot; who frequently ends her sentences with &quot;dayo&quot; and &quot;mon&quot;.

<text>Leaf is a Japanese visual novel studio under the publisher Aquaplus, and has offices in Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, and Tokyo. It and its competitor Key (to which it is often compared) are two of the most popular and successful dedicated visual novel studios operating today. It was launched out of obscurity by its early release &quot;To Heart&quot;. Leaf used the XviD video codec in several games: &quot;Aruru to Asobo!!&quot;, &quot;Tears to Tiara&quot;, &quot;Kusari&quot;, and &quot;ToHeart2 X Rated&quot;. Since XviD is free software, released under the GPL, Leaf was obligated to release the source code to those games under the same license. One still requires the game data to actually play the games with the source code. In addition, a free software game engine, named xlvns, was developed soon after Leaf released its first three visual novels. Characters from &quot;Utawarerumono&quot;, &quot;Tears to Tiara&quot;, &quot;To Heart&quot;, and &quot;Kizuato&quot; are playable in &quot;&quot;, a fighting game developed by Aquaplus featuring characters from various Leaf games.

<text>John Phillip Bengtson (July 17, 1913 – December 18, 1994) was an American football player and coach. He was a longtime assistant coach in college football and the National Football League (NFL), chiefly remembered as the successor to Vince Lombardi as head coach of the Green Bay Packers in 1968.

==Career==
Bengtson was a native of Roseau, Minnesota, and played tackle under Bernie Bierman at the University of Minnesota during the 1930s. In 1934, he earned All-America honors with the Golden Gophers, working in tandem with a player who went to coaching immortality: quarterback Bud Wilkinson.

Bengtson took his first assistant coaching job at the University of Missouri in 1935, but soon returned to his alma mater as line coach, staying through the 1939 season. Beginning in 1940, he moved to Stanford University, where he served as an assistant coach for 12 years. Bengtson moved to the professional level in 1952 with the nearby San Francisco 49ers.

In seven seasons with the Niners, Bengtson served under three head coaches: (Buck Shaw, Red Strader, Frankie Albert) before being dismissed with Albert after the 1958 season. Soon after, he was one of the first four assistants hired in Lombardi&#x27;s first week with the Packers in early February 1959.

Bengtson was the only assistant coach to stay for the entire nine-year tenure of Lombardi (1959–1967). His work as defensive coordinator of the Packers established his coaching ability and put him in line to succeed Lombardi. From 1961 to 1967, the Packers captured five NFL titles, and the first two Super Bowls.

Bengtson replaced Lombardi following the 1967 season; his low-key approach was in sharp contrast to the often-volatile Lombardi. With the aging of key players, this translated into mediocrity for the franchise. Bengtson&#x27;s Packers were 20–21–1 in his three seasons as head coach. After a 6–8 record in 1970, he was relieved of his duties, replaced by Missouri head coach Dan Devine for the 1971 season. Devine lasted four seasons with the Packers, moving back to the collegiate level at the University of Notre Dame following the 1974 season. Lombardi&#x27;s former quarterback, Bart Starr, became the head coach of the Packers in 1975. In 1985, Bengston was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

Bengtson resurfaced with the San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots, becoming the interim head coach of the Patriots in late 1972. Later, he was named the team&#x27;s Director of Pro Scouting, staying through the 1974 season.
Bengtson died at age 81 after a long illness at his home in San Diego on December 18, 1994.

<text>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition was a world&#x27;s fair held in Omaha, Nebraska, from June 1 to November 1, 1898. Its goal was to showcase the development of the entire West from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Coast. The Indian Congress was held concurrently. Over 2.6million people came to Omaha to view the 4,062 exhibits during the five months of the Exposition. President William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan were among the dignitaries who attended at the invitation of Gurdon Wattles, the event&#x27;s leader. A hundred thousand people assembled on the plaza to hear them speak. The Expo stretched over a tract in North Omaha and featured a lagoon encircled by 21 classical buildings that featured fine and modern products from around the world.

One reporter wrote, &quot;Perhaps the candid Nebraskan would tell you in a moment of frank contriteness that the prime object of this exposition was to boom Omaha.&quot;

== Timeline ==
The decision to hold [an] Exposition was made in late 1895 by a small committee of Omaha businessmen determined to hold the Expo, led by banker Gurdon Wattles. In making their decision, the committee set aside several sites for consideration, including an area near 16th Avenue and Pershing Drive in East Omaha, near the now-dry Florence Lake. It was the preferred site for the Exposition early in 1897. surrounding the tract that became Miller Park was considered the strongest contender towards the middle of the year. However, both sites ended up losing out to a site in North Omaha later in the year when Omaha banker Herman Kountze donated land in his Kountze Place development to the City of Omaha. After the Expo some of that land would become Kountze Park.

Many important developments happened throughout the city before the opening of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. They included the opening of the Burlington Train Station in downtown Omaha.

During the Expo, on August 31, 1898, the committee declared &quot;Cody Day&quot; in honor of Buffalo Bill Cody. Cody brought his &quot;world-famous&quot; Wild West Show back to the Omaha Driving Park where it was formally founded several years earlier.

October 12 was &quot;President&#x27;s Day&quot; at the Expo and featured a speech by President William McKinley focused on international affairs and the necessity of not being isolationist.

The total attendance was 2,613,508, and the total receipts were $1,924,077. The following year after the Expo some members of its managing committee decided to host another Expo-type event, which became the Great American Exposition in summer 1899.

== Construction ==

Many temporary buildings, structures, and features were installed for the Exposition. Thomas Rogers Kimball and C. Howard Walker were named co-architects-in-chief for the event. The two men were responsible for the overall site development, including perimeter buildings. They designed several major buildings, some smaller structures and the Arch of States, which was a main entrance.

All these structures were temporary by design, built at about half the cost of permanent buildings. The lower cost allowed the construction of larger structures. The construction of the hundreds of temporary buildings at the Expo was notable because of the almost exclusive usage of a new, cheap and pliable building material called staff. It allowed Expo designers to construct visual reproductions of Grecian and Roman temples, fine European buildings, and more. The buildings were constructed of strips of wood covered with staff.

The Grand Court of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition was located on the current site of Kountze Park.

==Commemoration==

The Post Office Department issued a series of nine postage stamps to mark the Exposition, each depicting a Western scene. Now known as the Trans-Mississippi Issue and considered among the finest stamps produced by the US, they are highly prized by collectors; a complete unused set is worth about US$5,000. The stamps were reissued in 1998 for a limited time. 1¢ postal cards were also issued.

A monument to the exposition was placed in Omaha&#x27;s Kountze Park, the former site of the exposition, during a Centennial celebration of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in 1998.

<doc id="834539" wikidata="Q977830" url="?curid=834539" title="Kanishka II">
<text>Kanishka II (Brahmi: 𑀓𑀸𑀡𑀺𑀱𑁆𑀓; &quot;&quot;) was one of the emperors of the Kushan Empire from around 232-247 CE. He succeeded Vasudeva I who is considered to be the last great Kushan emperor.

==Rule==
While he upheld Kushan rule in northern India, it is likely that Kanishka II lost the western part of his empire, namely Bactria/Tokharistan to the Sasanian Shapur I (240-272 CE), whose conquests would be consolidated by the Kushano-Sassanians. In his inscriptions at Naqsh-e Rostam Shapur now claimed that he controlled the realm of the Kushans (Kūšān šahr) &quot;up to Pašakibur (i.e. Purushapura)&quot; (Peshawar), suggesting that he may have expanding even beyond the Hindu-Kush at the expense of the Kushans. The rock inscription at Rag-i-Bibi further support this view.

Several overstrikes by the Kushano-Sasanian Peroz I Kushanshah over coins of Kanishka II are known, and it is from the time of Peroz that the first Kushano-Sasanian coins were issued south of the Hindu-Kush.

Kanishka II may have retaken control of Gandhara at one point, as well as Kapiśa, and there are suggestions that following these successes he may have created a second Era of Kanishka in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the original one.

<doc id="834560" wikidata="Q1275140" url="?curid=834560" title="Vima Kadphises">
<text>Vima Kadphises (Greek: Οοημο Καδφιϲηϲ &quot;Ooēmo Kadphisēs&quot; (epigraphic); Kharosthi: 𐨬𐨁𐨨 𐨐𐨫𐨿𐨤𐨁𐨭 &#x27;,&#x27;) was a Kushan emperor from approximately 113 to 127 CE. According to the Rabatak inscription, he was the son of Vima Takto and the father of Kanishka.

==Rule==

=== Genealogy ===
The connection of Vima Kadphises with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription, which Kanishka wrote. Kanishka makes the list of the kings who ruled up to his time: Kujula Kadphises as his great-grandfather, Vima Taktu as his grandfather, Vima Kadphises as his father, and himself Kanishka:

&quot;... for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and *also for himself, King Kanishka&quot; (Cribb and Sims-Williams 1995/6: 80)
Emperor Vima Kadphises expanded the Kushan territory in Afghanistan and north-west India, where he may have replaced the Indo-Scythian ruler Sodasa in Mathura.

== Coins ==

He was the Kushan emperor to first introduce gold coinage, in addition to the existing copper and silver coinage. Most of the gold seems to have been obtained through trade with the Roman Empire. The gold weight standard of approximately eight grams corresponds to that of Roman coins of the 1st century. Gold bullion from Rome would be melted and used for the Kushan mints, into three denominations: the double stater, the stater, and the quarter starter (or dinara).

The usage of gold testifies to the prosperity of the Kushan Empire from the time of Vima, being the center of trade between the Han dynasty of China (where Vima was known as 阎膏珍), Central Asia and Alexandria and Antioch in the West. The Kushan were able to maintain and protect the Silk Road, allowing silk, spices, textiles or medicine to move between China, India and the West. In particular, many goods were sent by ship to the Roman empire, creating a return flow of gold coins, Greek wine and slaves. Works of arts were also imported from all directions , as indicated by the variety and quality of the artefacts found in the Kushan summer capital of Bagram in Afghanistan. A strong artistic syncretism was stimulated, as indicated by the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.

Roman history relates the visit of ambassadors from the Indian kings to the court of Trajan (98–117 CE), bearing presents and letters in Greek, which were sent either by Vima Kadphises or his son Kanishka.

Most of Vima&#x27;s coins feature the Buddhist symbol of the Triratana on the reverse (or possibly Shiva&#x27;s symbol for Nandi, the Nandipada), together with Hindu representations of Shiva, with or without his bull. Often time, a Trishul is depicted along with Shiva.

<text>A houseplant, sometimes known as a pot plant, potted plant, or an indoor plant, is an ornamental plant that is grown indoors. As such, they are found in places like residences and offices, mainly for decorative purposes. Common houseplants are usually tropical or semi-tropical, and are often epiphytes, succulents or cacti.

==Care==

Houseplants have care requirements that differ from plants grown outdoors. Moisture, light, soil mixture, temperature, ventilation, humidity, fertilizers, and potting are all important factors. Each plant species has different care requirements, and care requirements can vary based on the specific pot, location in a particular home and potting mix used. However, all potted plants should have drainage holes to prevent root rot.

Most houseplants are species that have adapted to survive in a temperature range between year-round, as those adapted for temperate environments require winter temperatures outside of normal indoor conditions. Within that limitation, there are houseplants which are native to many different types of habitats, from tropical rainforests to succulents and cacti native to deserts. Many houseplants are either epiphytes or live in seasonally dry ecosystems that help them adapt to the dry indoor air and inconsistent watering many houseplants are subject to. Often, houseplants from tropical areas are understory plants, and because they grown in shady conditions naturally, they are often able to thrive in lower-light conditions.

Selected houseplants are typically of healthy origin, with tidy leaves and upright stems. Houseplants which survive in conditions similar to a homeowner&#x27;s living space will have a higher probability of survival. Tropical houseplants which grow under high thresholds of heat, for instance, will grow sun leaves which contain fewer chloroplasts. Plants which grow in the shade will grow shade leaves, containing more chloroplasts. Horticulturists at Texas A&amp;M University recommend acclimatization, a gradual process in which plants with too much or too little light or heat exposure are balanced accordingly to prevent overexposure. The brightness and strength of the light source under which a plant lives, including how long it spends under that light source, is vital to its survival. Other factors, like humidity and ventilation, must be kept under regular levels to prevent plant failure and susceptibility to disease.

Houseplants are typically grown in specialized soilless mixtures called potting compost (in the UK), potting mix, or potting soil. Most potting mixes contain a combination of peat or coir and vermiculite or perlite.

Keeping plants consistently too wet (&quot;overwatering&quot;) leads to the roots sitting in water, which often leads to root rot. Root rot is the most common cause of death for houseplants but keeping houseplants too dry (&quot;under-watering&quot;) can also be detrimental.

Plants require nitrate, phosphate, and potassium to survive, as well as micronutrients including boron, zinc, manganese, iron, copper, molybdenum, and chlorine. Houseplants do not have access to these nutrients unless they are fertilized regularly.

House plants are generally planted in pots that have drainage holes, to reduce the likelihood of over-watering and standing water. Pots are typically broken down into two groups: porous and non-porous. Porous pots (usually terracotta) provide better aeration as air passes laterally through the sides of the pot. Non-porous pots such as glazed or plastic pots tend to hold moisture longer and restrict airflow.

Houseplants experience a range of pests. Fungus gnats, spider mites, mealybugs, thrips and scale are common pests.

With the right care, succulents avoid pests and diseases and achieve optimal growth. By picking the right succulent and taking care of its soil and watering needs, the houseplant lives long to serve its purpose.

===Indoor environment===
Plants also appear to affect the indoor microbiome, increasing the number and diversity of bacteria in homes, while reducing fungal diversity. They tend to increase humidity, reduce temperature swings, and reduce noise.

===Alternative growing methods===
Houseplants are also grown in a variety of media other than potting mix, often in a hydroponic or semi-hydroponic system. This may overlap with aquascaping. Materials like sand, gravel, brick, expanded clay aggregate and styrofoam may be employed.

Some epiphytic plants may be grown mounted, either with their roots in potting mix and their stems attached to supports, or with their roots wrapped in sphagnum moss and attached to a vertical surface with wire. This can also overlap with the practice of kokedama.

== Cultural history ==
===Early history===
The history of houseplants is intertwined with the history of container gardening in general. Ancient Egyptians grew ornamental (flowers) and fruiting plants in decorative containers, where blue and white lotus floral arrangements gave rise to more luxuriant bouquets during the New Kingdom. Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut grew frankincense in her temple in 1478 BC. Ancient Greeks and the Romans cultivated laurel trees (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;) in earthenware vessels. Roman villas were perfumed with the blossom of citrus trees. In ancient China, potted plants were shown at garden exhibitions over 2,500 years ago, and they were seen as a symbol of wealth. In around 600 BC, King Nebuchadnezzar constructed a botanical garden for his wife, Queen Amytis, filling them with fragrant flowers.

In the medieval era, gillyflowers were displayed in containers.

===Early modern era===
During the Renaissance (15th–16th centuries), plant collectors and affluent merchants from Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium imported plants from Asia Minor and the East Indies. Creeping groundsel was introduced in Malta and the rest of Europe in the 15th century as an ornamental plant.

In the 17th century, fascination in exotic plants grew among the aristocracy of France and England. Inventor and writer Sir Hugh Platt published &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; in 1660, a book which directed indoor plant growing methods. Wealthy British households purchased imported fruit trees, especially citrus trees, to grow in specialized orangeries. Less wealthy people would also grow plants, especially flowers, indoors. Orange trees became less fashionable as international commerce in oranges became more widespread. Succulents, such as aloes, were also cultivated.

===18th century===
In the early 18th century, windows in London became wider and brighter, expanding the opportunities for the lower classes to grow plants indoors.

The expansion of European colonialism brought Europeans into contact with a wide variety of new plants, especially tropical plants more suited to growing as houseplants. Explorers and botanists brought over 5,000 species to Europe from South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.

Forcing plants to bloom out of season, especially bulbs, grew in popularity during the 18th century. The decorative pot or cachepot specifically for growing houseplants (as opposed to a simple terracotta pot, or a decorative vase) was developed in this era as ceramic manufacturing took off.

Plant breeding developed in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These innovations were drawn and presented in the botanical gardens and in private court collections. At the end of the 18th century, flower tables became part of the salons. Furthermore, nurseries were flourishing in the 18th century, which stocked thousands of plants, including citrus, jasmines, mignonette, bays, myrtles, agaves and aloes.

===19th century===
The Victorian era saw the first use of houseplants by the middle class, which were perceived as a symbol of social status and moral value. Some foliage plants which tolerated the typical gloomy and snug environment inside a Victorian house became popular. The quintessential Victorian plants were palms (such as kentia palms and parlour palms), the cast iron plant, and ferns. Ferns were grown in Wardian cases, an early type of terrarium. Geraniums were often placed on window ledges and in drawing rooms and were the most affordable houseplant for the average Briton.

In 1818, orchids were introduced to Europe when they were used as packing material for the shipment of other rare plants. German ivy was introduced in the United States sometime in the 19th century as a houseplant.

Other typical Victorian houseplants included mop-head chrysanthemums and yuccas.

At the end of the 19th century, the range already included begonias, cineraria, clivia, cyclamen and flamingo flowers, but also leafy ornamental plants such as silver fir, ornamental asparagus, lilium, snake plant, and rubber tree.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, there was a turn against houseplants as they were seen as dated relics of the cluttered Victorian era. When there were houseplants, the more architecturally shaped cacti and succulents were the most common. In the 1920s, commercial houseplant production began in California, focused on the Kentia palm and the pothos, later expanding to include &quot;Philodendron&quot; and &quot;Araucaria&quot; species in the 1940s.

During World War II, houseplants became more common in offices, which began to more closely resemble the domestic environment as more women entered the workforce.

By 1960, Florida produced more than 55% of American houseplants, and has since remained the main producer of houseplants for the American market. Philodendrons, rubber plants and geraniums were mainstays of the postwar era. Many plants entered the United States and the United Kingdom through the influence of Scandinavian design, which featured plants. Tropical plants like bromeliads, birds of paradise, and philodendrons were popular accents in tiki-themed spaces. The postwar years also saw a broader commercialization of houseplants. In the 1960s, plant care labels were introduced, and garden centers became ubiquitous in the 1970s.

A lush display of houseplants fit into the environmentalist and hippie movements in the 1970s; a large indoor garden is characteristic of 1970s design. Leafy plants were popular, particularly ferns and spider plants, often in macramé hanging planters. &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot;, ferns, aloes and snake plants (&quot;Dracaena&quot; species, usually sold under their former genus of Sanseveria) were also popular. Terrariums and bottle gardens began to appear as well.

In the 1980s, houseplants were often limited to large, lush statement pieces, particularly in bathrooms. The rise of shopping malls with large skylights created a new place for plants to be grown. In the 1990s, moth orchids became trendy. The 1990s also brought a wave of interest in artificial plants.

===21st century===
Beginning in the mid-to-late 2010s, fashionable plants from earlier decades were revitalized and popularized by social media, especially Instagram, with &quot;plantstagram&quot; becoming a major driver of trendy plants. In 2015, 5million Americans took up plant-related hobbies. In 2017, 30% of American households purchased at least one houseplant.

Interest in houseplants exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020. With people forced to spend more time indoors, many sought to fill their homes with houseplants. Plants were mentioned on Instagram an average of more than 3,000 times a day in July 2021 and the hashtag &quot;#plantmom&quot; had been used more than 2.6million times. Plant sales in 2020 were at an all-time high, which brought concerns about the environmental impact of the industry.

Some of the most popular plants in the 2020s are the &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; and other aroids, as well as the fiddle-leaf fig. This has also seen a larger interest in growing plants with interesting or attractive forms or foliage, rather than focusing solely on flowers.

== Production ==
Houseplants are obtained either by collecting wild specimens of plants, or by growing them in greenhouses or commercial nurseries.

Wild collection of plants for the houseplant trade is a major threat to many species, especially plants with limited native ranges. Plants which are particularly threatened in this way are cacti, succulents, and carnivorous plants, especially Venus flytraps.

Plants grown for commercial production may be produced from seed, by using traditional propagation techniques, or through tissue culture. In 2002, the wholesale value of foliage plants grown in the United States was roughly $700million, mostly grown in Florida. In 2018, houseplant growers in the Netherlands produced 1billion houseplants for the European market.

==Effects of houseplants==
===Air quality===
Although houseplants are commonly considered to have an active, positive effect on indoor air quality, much of the non-academic reporting on the subject is based on experiments involving the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air, the evidence for which is unclear.

The 1989 NASA Clean Air Study was set up to research ways to clean the air in sealed environments such as space stations. This included an early study on the ability of potted plants to remove VOCs, which concluded that plants, specifically a combination of their roots and the soil microorganisms, were highly effective. However, this study tested plants in ways which are not representative of an indoor environment; in sealed chambers and with highly elevated levels of the VOCs benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde. Subsequent studies have confirmed the combined role of soil and roots and showed that they were effective at cleaning in higher VOC concentrations, but only at lower concentrations after the process had been &quot;kick-started&quot; by a higher level of exposure. Others have shown that is possible to artificially enrich the soil directly with VOC-degrading bacteria and achieve the same result, and posited that exposure to high VOC levels (or low levels but in bursts) during experiments and the subsequent increase in such bacteria may have been a cause of the large differences seen in the results of various studies. A 2019 review paper calculated that it would require between 10 and 1000 houseplants per square meter to achieve the same level of VOC removal as occurs from passive exchange between indoor and outdoor air.

Houseplants do have a statistically significant effect on the concentrations of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in normal indoor environments, reducing carbon dioxide levels by 10–25% and carbon monoxide levels by up to 90%.

===Human well-being===
There are also many claimed psychological and physiological benefits to having houseplants. A 2022 systematic review with some meta-analyses included 42 studies which together measured the following human functions to study the benefits of indoor plants:

Physiology:
* Reaction time
* Pain tolerance
* Skin and body temperature
* Blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood saturation, blood volume pulse and power spectral density
* Respiratory rate
* Cortisol level, galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity)
* Salivary amylase activity
* Critical flicker fusion frequency

Cognition:
* Reaction time
* Performance on various tasks: sorting, productivity, association, reading, information processing, vigilance, reading span, digit span, and the stroop task
* Neurobehavioral functioning assessment
* Brain activity
* Eye movement
* Academic grades

Behavior:
* Pain tolerance and pain killer consumption
* Sick leave, workplace misconduct

Health:
* Pain tolerance
* Pain killer consumption
* Sick leave
* Hospitalization days

Most but not all studies found a positive effect of plants. Each of the above functions was found to be influenced positively by the majority of the studies which measured it. The authors only had enough good-quality comparable data to synthesize six areas, from which they confirmed a statistically significant improvement only in diastolic blood pressure and academic performance.

A critical review of the experimental literature concluded in 2009:

Houseplants can offer minor recovery from stress when instituted as part of an environment. The presence of a houseplant in an office setting can also increase productivity. A 2004 controlled study discovered that houseplants could improve mental focus, stabilize mood, and raise psychological motivation when present in otherwise unadorned environments.

<text>Inaya Day (born Inaya Davis, January 17, 1977) is an American singer, best known for her vocal work on house music tracks such as &quot;Horny &#x27;98&quot; by Mousse T, and her cover version of &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; by Prince protégées Vanity 6.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Day started singing in church in Brooklyn, New York. She attended the prestigious High School of Music and the Performing Arts, and went on to study musical theater at the University of Bridgeport. She also appeared on Broadway, notably as understudy to Stephanie Mills as &quot;Dorothy&quot; in &quot;The Wiz&quot;, and stepped into the lead role in Washington, D.C., and St. Louis, Missouri.

She has had extensive experience as a session musician, having appeared on tracks by Michael Jackson, Al Green, Puff Daddy, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Monie Love, Big Daddy Kane and Jonathan Butler. Day has also written songs for Randy Crawford and Bootsy Collins, and has writing credits on Missy Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Gossip Folks&quot; (the second single from her &quot;Under Construction&quot; album), on which Day co-wrote the hook and provided backing vocals.

===House music===
Day was introduced to house music in 1996 when she was asked to do a demo. She met German record producers Boris Dlugosch and Mousse T, who produced a dance single &quot;Keep Pushin&quot;, which went on to reach No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts. She then sang chorus for Mousse T&#x27;s track &quot;Horny&quot;, which later gained in popularity when additional vocals from the duo Hot &#x27;N&#x27; Juicy were added to the song. &quot;Horny&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart. The follow-up song &quot;Hold Your Head Up High&quot;, with Booom!, reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart.

In 1997, she released the club anthem &quot;Movin&#x27; Up&quot;, credited as DJ Mike Cruz Presents Inaya Day and Chyna Ro. For this record, long time friend and actress Tichina Arnold lent her vocals but chose to use the moniker Chyna Ro for the project. She again teamed up with Cruz for &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; which reached No. 1 on the Billboard club play chart.

In 2004 she sang on a track by the Australian dance producer mrTimothy called &quot;I Am Tha 1&quot;, credited to Mr Timothy featuring Inaya Day, which went to the top of the Australian dance charts and top 30 in the Australian pop charts. She also sang on his next single &quot;Stand By Me&quot; later that year. &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; was first released in Australia, reaching the top 20, and it was then released in the UK in July 2005, and reached No. 9 there. Later that year, she also guest featured on &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;, a single by T-Funk, an alternate alias of mrTimothy. In June 2007, Day released a cover version of the 1988 Big Pig song, &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which itself was a cover of the song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Break Away&quot; by Chuck Jackson.

==Family life==
Day is also the cousin of Solomon Roberts Jr., the bandleader and co-founder of the Dance/funk group Skyy, for which she has confirmed as she is serving as a contributor as part of a profile on the group in an &quot;Unsung&quot; episode that will in March 2020.

<text>Henry of Ghent ( 1217 – 29 June 1293), also known as Henricus de Gandavo and Henricus Gandavensis, was a scholastic philosopher who acquired the nickname of &quot;Doctor Solemnis&quot; (the &quot;Solemn Doctor&quot;). 

== Life ==
Henry was born in the district of Mude, near Ghent. He is supposed to have belonged to an Italian family named Bonicolli, in Dutch &quot;Goethals&quot;, but the question of his name has been much discussed (see authorities below). He studied at Ghent and then at Cologne under Albertus Magnus. After obtaining the degree of doctor he returned to Ghent, and is said to have been the first to lecture there publicly on philosophy and theology.

Attracted to Paris by the fame of the university, he took part in the many disputes between the orders and the secular priests, on the side of the latter. While Henry was a regent master at the University of Paris, the Condemnations of 1277 took place. The bishop of Paris, Stephen Tempier, promulgated a condemnation of some 219 propositions put forth by the masters of the Faculty of Theology. Henry had a hand in the creation of these propositions and because of that he was summoned to the papal legate after a fellow Augustinian, Giles of Rome. The summons was supposed to change Henry&#x27;s mind concerning Thomas Aquinas and his unicity thesis (which stated that the human soul, the substantial form of the body, is the undivided principle of the individual&#x27;s life, sensitivity and rationality). Following the publication of the papal bull &quot;Ad fructus uberes&quot; by Pope Martin IV in 1281, Henry supported the secular clergy against the Mendicant Orders over the question of the &#x27;reiteration of confession&#x27; (the obligation to confess to their parish priest, at least once a year, sins already confessed to a friar). Henry was engaged in this violent controversy for the rest of his life. He died at Tournai (or Paris).

== Ideas ==

=== Being of essence ===
Henry argued that not only do individual creatures have a being corresponding to their essence - the being of essence or &quot;esse essentiae&quot;, they also have a &#x27;somethingness&#x27; (&quot;aliquitas&quot;). The being created by God is not the being of actual existence, but the being of essence, also called &quot;esse latissimum&quot; (being in the widest sense), or &quot;esse communissimum&quot;, the most general form of being. The determination of essence respecting its being made actual is a delimitation, or specification, of that being. Thus, &quot;esse essentiae&quot; comes first, then comes &quot;esse aliquid per essentiam&quot;, being a &quot;something&quot; through essence, finally the whole essence thus made up is put into actuality.

=== Intentional distinction ===

An intentional distinction is where the very same thing is expressed by different concepts in different ways (&quot;Quodl&quot;. V, q. 12). Unlike a purely logical distinction, an intentional distinction always implies a sort of composition, although it is minor with regard to that implied by a distinction in reality.

For example, &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;, as they are found in man, is not a distinction of reason, since one is not a definition of the other. Nor is a real distinction, otherwise the conjunction of &#x27;animal&#x27; and &#x27;rational&#x27; in some particular person would be purely accidental (&quot;per accidens&quot;). Therefore, there must be some intermediate distinction, which Henry defines as &#x27;intentional&#x27;. This principle was later developed by Scotus into the formal distinction.

=== Illumination ===

Henry&#x27;s doctrines are infused by a strong Platonism. He distinguished between knowledge of actual objects and the divine inspiration by which we cognize the being and existence of God. The first throws no light upon the second. Individuals are constituted not by the material element but by their independent existence, i.e. ultimately by the fact that they are created as separate entities. Universals must be distinguished according as they have reference to our minds or to the divine mind. In the divine intelligence exist exemplars or types of the genera and species of natural objects.

On this subject Henry is far from clear; but he defends Plato against the current Aristotelian criticism, and endeavours to show that the two views are in harmony. In psychology, his view of the intimate union of soul and body is remarkable. The body he regards as forming part of the substance of the soul, which through this union is more perfect and complete.

=== Scientific knowledge ===

Henry&#x27;s standards for truth exceeded what is now commonly accepted in science. Following closely Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, he demanded that &quot;First, it must be certain, i.e. exclusive of deception and doubt; secondly, it must be of a necessary object; thirdly, it must be produced by a cause that is evident to the intellect; fourthly, it must be applied to the object by a syllogistic reasoning process&quot;. He thus excluded from the realm of the knowable anything about contingent objects. In this respect he was contradicted by his younger contemporary Duns Scotus.

Samuel Hui Koon-kit (born 6 September 1948), usually known as Sam Hui, is a Hong Kong musician, singer, songwriter and actor. He is credited with popularising Cantopop both via the infusion of Western-style music and his usage of vernacular Cantonese rather than written vernacular Chinese in biting lyrics that addressed contemporary problems and concerns. Hui is considered by some to be the first major superstar of Cantopop, known as the God of Song. As an actor, he is well-known for portraying the main character &quot;King Kong&quot; in five installments of the Aces Go Places film series.

==Early life==
Hui was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China in 1948. His parents were both musicians; his father was a traditional Chinese musician while his mother was a Chinese opera singer. In 1950, along with his three older brothers, Michael, Ricky, and Stanley, Hui and his parents arrived in Hong Kong as refugees in 1950, originally living in Diamond Hill. Hui graduated from the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Hong Kong, Ying Wa College and St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s College, Tai Kok Tsui in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hui worked with Michael and Ricky on several comedies in the early 1970s. Hui has also gained credit for popularising Cantopop, by incorporating the idiosyncrasies of Western popular music into the old Cantopop genre.

==Career==

===Singer===
In the 1960s, Hui began his singing career. In 1967, Hui joined record label Diamond Records.

Hui started his television career as a host on a youth music TV show on the TVB network. Hui and his brother Michael Hui became hosts in the &quot;Hui Brothers Show&quot;, which premiered on April 23, 1971.

Hui became the lead musician of a band The Lotus.

In the 1970s, Hui performed English songs that were popular in Britain and the United States. He wrote the theme songs for the comedies produced by his brother, Michael Hui, and started performing Cantonese songs. Sam Hui&#x27;s first Cantonese hit, &quot;Eiffel Tower Above the Clouds&quot; () – originally titled &quot;Here and Now&quot; () – was first played on the &quot;Hui Brothers Show&quot; in April 1972.

Hui signed a contract with Polydor and produced his first single in English, &quot;April Lady&quot;.

Hui&#x27;s first Cantonese album, &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; (), was the partial soundtrack to the Michael Hui-directed film of the same name. This album became popular, selling 200,000 copies, and was one of the major musical works that helped to start the popularity of Cantopop.

Hui&#x27;s music gained popular appeal, particularly with the working class, for its simplicity and the relevance of the lyrics. A prolific songwriter, a noted recurring theme in his music is that it often describes or humorously satirises Hong Kong society and events.

In 1976, Hui&#x27;s singing and acting career took off after the release of the breakout album The Private Eyes, the soundtrack to the 1976 film The Private Eyes.

In the album The Private Eyes, it humorously reflected on the harsh realities of middle and lower-income Hong Kongers. Others such as &quot;Song of Water Use&quot; (), which referenced the days of water rationing during the 1960s, and &quot;Could Not Care Less About 1997&quot; (話知你97), which encouraged Hong Kong people to adopt a &quot;carpe diem&quot; attitude instead of worrying about the imminent handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 July 1997, were more topical in nature and referenced local events. While some of his songs are lighthearted, others carried philosophical messages brought out through artful use of Chinese words that have multiple symbolism. Examples can be seen in his farewell song in 1992 and &quot;From the Heart of a Loafer&quot; (), where for Cantopop, the sophisticated language and messages were rare in the lyrics of contemporary artists.

On June 17, 1979, Hui became the first singer from Hong Kong to perform at the Tokyo Music Festival.

===Film===
Hui signed a contract with Golden Harvest in 1971. On a personal note, Hui is closer to his middle brother Ricky (deceased 8 November 2011) than to their oldest brother Michael. Sam and Michael reportedly fell out with each other after their pre-1985 successes. However, in Michael&#x27;s &quot;Chicken and Duck Talk&quot; (1988), Hui appeared in a short 1-minute cameo, playing the role of himself as master of ceremonies at the grand opening of Danny&#x27;s Chicken, and contributed to its theme song for its end credits entitled &quot;You Have Your Say&quot; (). Then in 1990, the three brothers reunited in &quot;Front Page&quot;, a lampoon on Hong Kong&#x27;s sometimes over-zealous entertainment news industry. Hui also collaborated with several popular singers such as Leslie Cheung both musically and on-screen culminating in the hit single written by Hui and composed by Cheung entitled &quot;Silence is Golden&quot; (), which Cheung also sung as a solo track on his 1987 album, &quot;Hot Summer&quot;, as well as the catchy tune, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been Afraid&quot; () in 1989 as the end theme for &quot;Aces Go Places 5: The Terracotta Hit&quot;.

Hui also starred in the &quot;Aces Go Places&quot;, a series of Hong Kong action–comedies in the 1980s, with Karl Maka.

He was once seriously injured while filming &quot;The Legend of Wisely&quot; in Tibet due to lack of oxygen, thereafter falling very ill and many of his fans pointed out that this near fatal accident may have been pivotal on his decision to retire as they superstitiously believed that he was haunted by a spirit.

===Retirement===
During the late 1980s, Hui&#x27;s father advised him to retire to avoid the stresses he endured from hosting concerts. Hui&#x27;s &quot;lack of oxygen&quot; suffered on a previous film, was actually carbon monoxide poisoning. His mother purportedly also had reservations about his performing, including that he might injure himself on stage.

A Hong Kong concert in 1990 supposedly marked his early retirement, however Hui then agreed to host a 42-show concert series. Around the time of the 30th show, Hui&#x27;s father died but despite his grief, he continued to host.

=== Farewell concerts ===
In 1991 to 1992, Hui held many farewell concerts. Hui hosted a total of 14 shows in Hong Kong preempting his actual retirement.

Hui is known as the Canto-pop godfather and the Elvis Presley of Hong Kong.

Hui also hosted shows in Canada, in Vancouver, at the Pacific Coliseum, and Toronto, Ontario, which he dedicated to his late father. Despite reiterating his plans for retirement, Hui came back for a short stint in the movie &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; co-starring Nicholas Tse and Ruby Lin. This he maintained, was a result of being unable to ignore his heart&#x27;s desire.

Widely acclaimed as the &quot;God of Song&quot; in Hong Kong (the first singer to be so acknowledged), he decided to come out of retirement in 2004 and held multiple comeback concerts in which he was welcomed by a Hong Kong public at sell-out shows. In these concerts, he paid tribute to his recent passed close colleagues, Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui in 2003 and claimed that their deaths had influenced his decision to return to performing, culminating in his 2004 comeback song &quot;&#x27;04 Bless You&quot; (&#x27;04 祝福你). Hui performed in a concert in Kuala Lumpur on 19 and 20 February 2005 with his brother, Ricky Hui, and sons but has not made active plans for any follow-ups. He also performed in Vancouver on 15 December 2005 and in Singapore on 29 March 2008.

 In 2007, Hui signed with EC Music and released his first album in 17 years, named &quot;Life is Good&quot; ().

==Personal life==
In December 1971, Hui married Rebecca &quot;Rebu&quot; Fleming, a Filipino-American. They have two sons, Ryan Hui and Scott Hui. Hui and his family live in Hong Kong. Ryan Hui is a singer-songwriter and has released several albums, and Scott Hui is a film director.

<text>Lamrim (Tibetan: &quot;stages of the path&quot;) is a Tibetan Buddhist textual form for presenting the stages in the complete path to enlightenment as taught by Buddha. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of &quot;lamrim&quot;, presented by different teachers of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug schools. However, all versions of the &quot;lamrim&quot; are elaborations of Atiśa&#x27;s 11th-century root text &quot;A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment&quot; (&quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot;).

==History==

When Atiśa, the originator of the &quot;lamrim&quot; came from India to Tibet, he was asked by king Jang Chub Ö to give a complete and easily accessible summary of the doctrine in order to clarify wrong views, especially those resulting from apparent contradictions across the sutras and their commentaries. Based upon this request he wrote the &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot; (&quot;A Lamp for the Path to Awakening&quot;), teaching what came to be known as the &quot;lamrim&quot; for the Tibetans. Atiśa&#x27;s presentation of the doctrine later became known as the Kadampa tradition in Tibet.

According to Tsong Khapa, in his &quot;Lam Rim Chen Mo&quot; (&quot;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment&quot;), Atiśa took the number and order of the subjects in Maitreya-natha and Asaṅgas &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot; (&quot;Ornament of clear realizations&quot;), which was based on the wisdom sutras, as the basis to write the &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot;. In the &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot; they emphasised the hidden meanings of the sutras. Tibetan Buddhists thus believe that the teachings of the &quot;lamrim&quot; are based on the sutras that the Buddha taught and therefore contains the essential points of all sutra teachings in their logical order for practice.

Gampopa, a Kadampa monk and student of the famed &quot;yogi&quot; Milarepa, introduced the &quot;lamrim&quot; to his disciples as a way of developing the mind gradually. His exposition of &quot;lamrim&quot; is known in English translation as &quot;The Jewel Ornament of Liberation&quot; and is studied to this day in the various Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

The main Lam Rim text in the Nyingma tradition is Longchen Rabjampa&#x27;s &quot;Finding Rest in the Nature of Mind,&quot; along with its voluminous auto-commentary, &quot;The Great Chariot.&quot; Both lay out the entire scope of the buddhist teachings according to the view of the Nyingma school, from the foundational practices through to Dzogchen.

Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelug school which is primarily based on Atiśa&#x27;s Kadampa school, wrote one of his masterpieces on &quot;lamrim&quot;: &quot;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment&quot; (Tib. &quot;Lam-rim Chen-mo&quot;) which has about 1000 pages, and is primarily based on literary sources. There is also a medium-length &quot;lamrim&quot; text by Tsongkhapa (200 pages) and a short one, called &quot;Lam-rim Dü-dön&quot; (Tib.), which is recited daily by many Gelugpas and is about 10 pages long.

The Lamrim was the first Tibetan text translated into a European language by Ippolito Desideri, a Jesuit missionary, who visited Tibet and made an extensive study of Tibetan Buddhism from 1716 to 1721. Desideri studied the Lam Rim Chen Mo of Tsongkhapa, and his manuscript describing Tibet was one of the most extensive and accurate accounts of Buddhist philosophy until the twentieth century.

==Philosophy==

===Three kinds of motivation===
The starting point of the &quot;lamrim&quot; is a division of Buddhist practitioners into beings of three scopes, based upon the motivation of their religious activity. Disregarded in this division are individuals whose motives revolve around benefits in their current life. Striving for a favorable rebirth is implicitly the minimum requirement for an activity or practice to be classified as spiritual.

Atiśa wrote in &quot;Lamp of the Path&quot; (verse 2) that one should understand that there are three kind of persons:
# Persons of modest motive search for happiness within samsara; their motive is to achieve high rebirth. Buddhists traditionally consider that this domain includes followers of most non-Buddhist religions who strive for a rebirth in a heaven.
# Persons of medium motive are searching for their own ultimate peace and abandoned worldly pleasure. This includes the paths of &quot;pratyekabuddhas&quot; and &quot;śravakabuddhas&quot;, which seek personal liberation alone, the traditional goal of Hīnayāna practice.
# Persons of high motive, who, based on their insight of their own suffering, seek by all means to stop the suffering of all beings. This is the Mahāyāna Bodhisattva path of the &quot;samyaksaṃbuddhas&quot;, who practice the six Perfections.

One of the formulaic presentations of the Buddhist path in the Nikayas is &quot;anupubbikathā&quot;, &quot;graduated talk&quot; or &quot;progressive instruction,&quot; in which the Buddha talks on generosity (&quot;dāna&quot;), virtue (&quot;sīla&quot;), heaven (&quot;sagga&quot;), danger of sensual pleasure (&quot; ādīnava&quot;) and renunciation (&quot;nekkhamma&quot;). When the listener is prepared by these topics, the Buddha then delivers &quot;the teaching special to the Buddhas,&quot;
the Four Noble Truths (&quot;cattāri ariya-saccāni&quot;), by which arises &quot;the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma.&quot; In the Tibetan Lamrim teachings, the Bodhisattva-path, with its training of the six perfections, is added to this formula.

===Subjects of the &quot;lamrim&quot;===
Although &quot;lamrim&quot; texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways. The &quot;lamrim&quot; of Atiśa starts with bodhicitta, the altruistic mind of enlightenment, followed by taking the bodhisattva vows. Gampopa&#x27;s &quot;lamrim&quot;, however, starts with the Buddha-nature, followed by the preciousness of human rebirth. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s texts start with reliance on a guru (Tib.: &quot;lama&quot;), followed by the preciousness of human rebirth, and continue with the paths of the modest, medium and high scopes. Longchenpa&#x27;s lamrim begins with the four thoughts that turn the mind, and proceeds through to the two stages of vajrayana practice and dzogchen.

Gampopa, Tsongkhapa, Longchenpa, and others, expanded the short root-text of Atiśa into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like karma, rebirth, Buddhist cosmology and the practice of meditation are gradually explained in logical order.

==Outline of Topics==
An example of the outline for &quot;lamrim&quot; teachings is that of &quot;Liberation in the Palm of your Hand&quot; by Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo. An abbreviated and annotated outline follows to show the structure of this &quot;lamrim&quot;:

;Introduction
* the identities and lineages of the authors of the &quot;lamrim&quot; (Shakyamuni Buddha, Atisha, Dromtoenpa, etc.), to establish the authenticity of the teaching
* the greatness of the &quot;lamrim&quot; itself, to gain respect for it
* the way the instructions are to be received and given
* the way the students are to be guided through the subjects. This fourth subject has two divisions:
:* the way to rely on a spiritual guide
:* the way to train your mind on the basis of the correct way to rely on the spiritual guide. This last heading contains the rest of the instructions under the headings:
::* the way to encourage yourself to take the essence of this precious human rebirth
::* the way to take the essence of this precious human rebirth (that is: training your mind in the paths of the three scopes included within the &quot;lamrim&quot;)

;The path shared with persons who have the modest scope motivation
Striving for a rebirth in the upper realms:
* the reality that this life will end and that you will die
* the suffering in a rebirth in the lower realms (a rebirth as hell being, hungry ghost or animal, which you want to avoid)
* (so you) take refuge in the three Jewels: Buddha, Dharma and Sangha
* (and adjust your behavior of body, speech and mind according to the) law of cause and effect/ karma which will lead you to a favorable rebirth within cyclic existence in the human-, demigod-, or god realm.

;The path shared with persons who have the medium scope motivation
Striving for liberation of cyclic existence. The training in the medium scope path will lead to the development of the wish to be liberated from all un-free rebirths in cyclic existence through the power of afflictive emotions and karma. It consists of:
* The Four Noble Truths:
:* The truth of suffering (in cyclic existence in general, including the favorable rebirths)
:* The truth of the causes of suffering (the afflictive emotions, especially ignorance)
:* The truth of cessation (there is a state that is free of suffering and its origins)
:* The truth of paths (the way to attain this state free of suffering and its causes by practicing ethics, concentration and wisdom)
* Another presentation of the middle scope subjects is the presentation of the 12 links of dependent arising

;The path for persons who have the high scope motivation
Striving for complete buddhahood:
* Developing mind of enlightenment (&quot;bodhicitta&quot;), the wish to become a buddha for the welfare of all sentient beings:
:* the advantages of the mind of enlightenment;
:* the way to develop the mind of enlightenment
:* the 7-point instruction in seeing all sentient beings as your mothers (from previous lives and contemplating their kindness towards you)
:* the instruction on how to exchange your self-interest for others&#x27; interest (by looking at the drawbacks of self-cherishing and the advantages of cherishing others)
* the way to train your mind after developing the mind of enlightenment, by training the six perfections:
:* training in the perfection of generosity
:* training in the perfection of ethics
:* training in the perfection of patience
:* training in the perfection of joyful effort
:* training in the perfection of concentration
:* training in the perfection of wisdom

== Gelug Lamrim tradition ==
The study of Lamrim is a major focus of the Gelug school and numerous Gelug figures wrote Lamrim works. A collection of important Lamrim works is known as the Eight Great Commentaries (on Atisha&#x27;s &quot;Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment).&quot; The 14th Dalai Lama frequently teaches on these works. These are:

# &quot;The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim chen mo)&quot; by Je Tsong Khapa
# &quot;The Medium Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim ‘bring po)&quot; by Je Tsong Khapa
# &quot;The Concise Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim bsdus don)&quot; also known as Song of the Stages of the Path (lam rim nyams mgur) by Je Tsong Khapa
# &quot;The Essence of Refined Gold – Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim gser zhun ma)&quot; by His Holiness the Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso.
# &quot;The Easy Path – Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim bde lam)&quot; by Panchen Lobsang Chokyi Gyaltsen.
# &quot;The Sacred Words of Manjushri – Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim ‘jam dpal zhal lung)&quot; by the Fifth Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso
# &quot;The Swift Path – Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim myur lam)&quot; by Panchen Lobsang Yeshe 
# &quot;Essence of Fine Speech – Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim legs gsung nying khu)&quot; by Ngawang Drakpa of Dagpo

<text>Ray Jackendoff (born January 23, 1945) is an American linguist. He is professor of philosophy, Seth Merrin Chair in the Humanities and, with Daniel Dennett, co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. He has always straddled the boundary between generative linguistics and cognitive linguistics, committed to both the existence of an innate universal grammar (an important thesis of generative linguistics) and to giving an account of language that is consistent with the current understanding of the human mind and cognition (the main purpose of cognitive linguistics).

Jackendoff&#x27;s research deals with the semantics of natural language, its bearing on the formal structure of cognition, and its lexical and syntactic expression. He has conducted extensive research on the relationship between conscious awareness and the computational theory of mind, on syntactic theory, and, with Fred Lerdahl, on musical cognition, culminating in their generative theory of tonal music. His theory of conceptual semantics developed into a comprehensive theory on the foundations of language, which indeed is the title of a monograph (2002): &quot;Foundations of Language. Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution&quot;. In his 1983 &quot;Semantics and Cognition&quot;, he was one of the first linguists to integrate the visual faculty into his account of meaning and human language.

Jackendoff studied under linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his PhD in linguistics in 1969. Before moving to Tufts in 2005, Jackendoff was professor of linguistics and chair of the linguistics program at Brandeis University from 1971 to 2005. During the 2009 spring semester, he was an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. Jackendoff was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize in 2003. He received the 2014 David E. Rumelhart Prize. He has also been granted honorary degrees by the Université du Québec à Montréal (2010), the National Music University of Bucharest (2011), the Music Academy of Cluj-Napoca (2011), the Ohio State University (2012), and Tel Aviv University (2013).

==Interfaces and generative grammar==
Jackendoff argues against a syntax-centered view of generative grammar (which he calls &quot;syntactocentrism&quot;), at variance with earlier models such as the standard theory (1968), the extended standard theory (1972), the revised extended standard theory (1975), the government and binding theory (1981), and the minimalist program (1993), in which syntax is the sole generative component in the language. Jackendoff takes syntax, semantics, and phonology all to be generative, interconnected via interface components. The task of his theory is to formalize the proper interface rules.

While rejecting mainstream generative grammar due to its syntactocentrism, the cognitive semantics school has offered an insight that Jackendoff would sympathize with, namely, that meaning is a separate combinatorial system not entirely dependent upon syntax. Unlike many of the cognitive semantics approaches, he contends that neither syntax alone should determine semantics, nor vice versa. Syntax need only interface with semantics to the degree necessary to produce properly ordered phonological output (see Jackendoff 1996, 2002; Culicover &amp; Jackendoff 2005).

==Contribution to musical cognition==
Jackendoff, together with Fred Lerdahl, has been interested in the human capacity for music and its relationship to the human capacity for language. In particular, music has structure as well as a &quot;grammar&quot; (a means by which sounds are combined into structures). When a listener hears music in an idiom he or she is familiar with, the music is not merely heard as a stream of sounds; rather, the listener constructs an unconscious understanding of the music and is able to understand pieces of music never heard previously. Jackendoff is interested in what cognitive structures or &quot;mental representations&quot; this understanding consists of in the listener&#x27;s mind, how a listener comes to acquire the musical grammar necessary to understand a particular musical idiom, what innate resources in the human mind make this acquisition possible and, finally, what parts of the human music capacity are governed by general cognitive functions and what parts result from specialized functions geared specifically for music (Jackendoff &amp; Lerdahl, 1983; Lerdahl, 2001). Similar questions have also been raised regarding human language, although there are differences. For instance, it is more likely that humans evolved a specialized language module than having evolved one for music, since even the specialized aspects of music comprehension are tied to more general cognitive functions.

<doc id="834628" wikidata="Q332288" url="?curid=834628" title="Godfrey of Fontaines">
<text>Godfrey of Fontaines (Latin: Godefridus de Fontibus, born sometime before 1250, died 29 October 1306 or 1309), was a scholastic philosopher and theologian who was designated by the title Doctor Venerandus. He made contributions to a diverse range of subjects ranging from moral philosophy to epistemology. However, he is best known today for his work on metaphysics.

== Early life ==
Godfrey was born sometime before 1250 in the Principality of Liège, in present-day Belgium. He was likely born at Fontaines-les-Hozémont, a château owned by his noble family.

== Studies ==
Godfrey was a student at the University of Paris by at least 1277, but more probably as early as 1270, as he was likely there during the second regency of Thomas Aquinas (1269-1272) who had returned to Paris from the Santa Sabina &quot;studium provinciale&quot;. Aquinas&#x27; teaching was perhaps the strongest influence on Godfrey&#x27;s own thought, though he differed on issues such as the principle of individuation, and the distinction between essence and existence in material things. A notebook from his student years has been dated around 1271 to 1274 demonstrating his familiarity with views proposed by Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia, leading representatives of the radical Aristotelian movement in the Arts faculty at the time.

== Career ==
He was a &quot;Magister&quot;, or Master of Theology, at the University of Paris by at least 1285 because that is when he gave his first Quodlibet, which means he had earned his Magister regens in theology and because he would have to be at least 35for the honour, which offers the reasoning that his year of birth is 1250 or earlier. He was Magister regens from 1285 to 1299 and then again in 1303 to 1304. Godfrey was held in high esteem during his life, and held a number of ecclesiastical offices, including Canon of Liège, Canon of Tournai, Provost of St. Severin in Cologne (1287–1295), and possibly Canon of Paris. In 1300 he was chosen to be the Bishop of Tournai, but he chose not to take the position because of a contested election. Godfrey left Paris between his final Quodlibet in 1298-1299 and 1303/1304 yet returned before he died on 29 October 1306 or 1309. He had compiled a large library during his lifetime, which he donated to the Sorbonne upon his death; a portion of it is still intact.

== Writings ==
The most significant of Godfrey&#x27;s writings are transcriptions of Quodlibets of which he participated in 15 during his tenure at the University of Paris. These were week-long sessions held before Christmas and Easter in which participating Masters were required to answer questions chosen by their students.
This was taxing to the Master, who would have to argue a thoughtful and researched answer on an incredibly diverse range of subjects. Many Masters chose not to engage in the Quodlibets. Godfrey of Fontaines completed at least 15 Quodlibetal sessions. Hence, Godfrey discussed a very wide range of issues.
These and other writings show him to have been not merely a distinguished theologian and philosopher but also a canonist, jurist, moralist and conversationalist, who took an active part in the various ecclesiastical, doctrinal, and disciplinary disputes that stirred Paris during period.

Godfrey was reportedly influenced by Thomas Aquinas and was a defender of Thomism against his contemporaries. Thomism was a novel theory at the time, and was condemned by Étienne Tempier, Bishop of Paris (Condemnation of 1277), and opposed by John Peckham and many others. This is despite Godfrey attacking the mendicant orders throughout his career, whereas Aquinas was a member of the Dominican mendicant order. Wippel says Godfrey opposed the mendicant orders because of the belief that &quot;those who had confessed to mendicants by reason of the privileges granted to the latter by Pope Martin&#x27;s bull were still bound to confess the same sins once again to their own priests.&quot;

One of Godfrey&#x27;s largest contributions was to the field of metaphysics. He was opposed to Platonic arguments advanced from his contemporaries, such as Henry of Ghent. For example, he argued against the concept of Platonic ideal forms and that something&#x27;s essential substance and existence were one and the same. His philosophy was strongly influenced by Aristotle.

In the Quodlibetal VIII, Godfrey argues against the Franciscan Christian order and lays an early groundwork of political philosophy where he discusses the ideas of natural rights. Godfrey believed that natural law was dependent on individual self-preservation rather than a religious obligation; he says that “because by natural law each person is obliged to maintain his life…each person has dominion and a certain right in the common exterior goods of this world, a right that he cannot licitly renounce” according to the author Jussi Varkemaa as noted in Conrad Summenhart&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Individual Rights&quot;. Godfrey objects that the fundamental Franciscan approach to rights is illicit to human activity and natural rights. He says later that everyone has a right to subsistence, a right that they can never renounce. That applies to the mendicant orders because it applies to all members of society.

Stephen D. Dumont quotes Godfrey in the book &quot;Philosophical Debates at Paris in the Early 14th Century&quot;: &quot; “Medieval sources are nearly unanimous in identifying Godfrey as a prominent source for the unusual but very influential account of intention and remission known as the &quot;succession of forms&quot;. As explained by Dumont, the intension and the remission of forms concern the problem of a change of degree within a given kind of quality like the shading of a color, adjustment of heat or even the altering of moral or cognitive habits. Godfrey held the position that all specific forms are &quot;in their nature indivisible, invariable, and lacking in degrees&quot; (43) and &quot;the specific form of a quality in itself does not undergo any intension or remission but does so insofar as it is individuated in a subject&quot;. That line of thought differs drastically from other thinkers around then like Thomas Aquinas and Henry of Ghent, who held that there was a variation of specific forms which are divisible extensions. Godfrey refutes their claims through the reasoning that because qualities cannot change in degree because they are indivisible, they must change insofar as they are individuals, so he concludes that a “change in degree in an individual quality will also be a change of the individual itself, even when its species remains the same”.

Nine other noteworthy topics that Godfrey wrote about in the Quodlibetal are the subject of metaphysics, the division of being, the analogy of being, transcendentals, essence and existence, the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence and essence, the eternity of the world, substance and accidents, and abstraction.

== Influence ==
Godfrey&#x27;s &quot;XIV Quodlibeta&quot; were extensively studied and multiplied in manuscript form in the medieval schools but were published for the first time only in the early 20th century. A critical edition of the first four of them appeared in the series &quot;Les Philosophes Belges, Textes et Etudes&quot; (II, &quot;Les quatre premiers Quodlibets de Godefroid de Fontaines&quot;, by de Wulf and Pelzer, Louvain, 1904). 

Sometime in the 14th century, Godfrey, though well known in his own time, fell out of favour into nearly total obscurity. Thomas Aquinas sparked plenty of controversy and discussion in philosophy and theology in the last quarter-century of the 13th century. Many significant writers lived during this period, but for the most part until the 20th century, only Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus received any recognition. Godfrey may have been just as significant in his own time as both, yet for some reason, his works were edited and published only in the early 20th century. That may have more to do with his political affiliation than anything else. Religious scholars of the time became well known in the long run based mainly on how well promoted they were by the mendicant orders. Thomas Aquinas was promoted by the Dominican Order, and Duns Scotus was promoted by the Franciscan Order. However, Godfrey&#x27; writings had by the 1960s regained much popularity.

<text>James Bicheno Francis (May 18, 1815 – September 18, 1892) was a British-American civil engineer, who invented the Francis turbine.

==Early years==

James Francis was born in South Leigh, near Witney, Oxfordshire, in England, United Kingdom. He started his engineering career at the early age of seven as he worked as his father&#x27;s apprentice at the Porth Cawl Railway and Harbor Works in South Wales. When he turned 18, he decided to emigrate to the United States, in 1833. His first job was in Stonington, Connecticut, as an assistant to the railway engineer George Washington Whistler Jr., working on the New York and New Haven Railroad. A year later, James and his boss, Whistler, travelled north to Lowell, Massachusetts, where at the age of 19, he got a draftsman job with the Locks and Canal Company, and Whistler became chief engineer.

A few years later, in 1837, Whistler resigned, and went to work on Russia&#x27;s major railroads. Before departing, he appointed Francis chief engineer, and sold him his house on Worthen Street. In same year, James married Sarah W. Brownell in Lowell on July 12. Their first son, James Jr., was born March 30, 1840, and then they had five more children.

In 1841 came his first major project for the company. Francis was to analyse how much water each mill factory was using from the company&#x27;s channel system. Impressed by his abilities, the company named him &quot;Manager of Locks and Canals&quot; in 1845.

As manager and chief engineer, Francis was responsible for the construction of the Northern Canal and Moody Street Feeder. These two canals, built in the late 1840s and early 1850s, completed the 5.6 mile long Lowell canal system, and greatly increased the industrial power of the thriving industrial city&#x27;s mill complexes.

During his work on the Lowell systems, Francis was also consulted on many other water projects nationwide. When New York needed to increase their water supply, he consulted on the construction of the Quaker Bridge Dam on the Croton River in New York. He also consulted on the dam at Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River.

Their son James fought in the American Civil War as a second lieutenant in 1861. He was wounded in the hand at the Battle of Antietam as a captain, and finished the war in July 1865 as lieutenant colonel.

Francis was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1865.

==Fire sprinkler system==
In 1845, Francis developed the first sprinkler systems ever devised in the United States. However, any use of the system would flood the entire structure and its contents. It was not until 1875 that Henry S. Parmelee invented a sprinkler head that activated only one head at a time.

==Turbines==
Francis became fascinated with and tinkered with turbine designs, after Uriah A. Boyden first demonstrated his Boyden turbine in Lowell. The two engineers worked on improving the turbine. And in 1848, Francis and Boyden successfully improved the turbine with what is now known as the Francis turbine. Francis&#x27;s turbine eclipsed the Boyden turbine in power by 90%. In 1855, Francis published these findings in the &quot;Lowell Hydraulic Experiments&quot;.

==Flood control==

In 1850, Francis ordered the construction of the Great Gate over the Pawtucket Canal to protect the downtown mills from any devastating floods. This project quickly became known as &quot;Francis&#x27;s Folly&quot;, given that no one believed it would work, let alone ever be needed. But less than two years later, in 1852, the gates saved the city of Lowell from the devastating floods of 1852, and again in 1936, 1938, 2006, and 2007 by preventing the Merrimack River from entering the canal system. However, arson damage to the wooden gate in the 1970s, and the difficult method of dropping it (by breaking a large chain link) prompted the city to use a more modern steel-beam bulkhead in its place in 2006. For his efforts in saving the city from great disaster Francis was awarded a massive silver pitcher and a salver by the City of Lowell.
In 1886, Francis teamed up with two other civil engineers; Eliot C. Clarke and Clemens Herschel to study and publish their findings in the &quot;Prevention of Floods in the Valley of Stony Brook&quot; which laid out a flood prevention system for the city of Boston. The detailed study reviewed the Forest Hills, Hyde Park, Franklin park and Roslindale sections of the city that were subject to flooding.

==Later years==
Francis stayed active on all levels of involvement in the city of Lowell, and served as an alderman from 1862 to 1864.

In 1865, Francis researched and published his findings on cast iron, and its use in structural columns in &quot;The Strength of Cast-Iron Columns&quot;.

In 1874, Francis served on the American Society of Civil Engineers committee to investigate the cause of the breach of the Mill River dam in Massachusetts.  Also on the committee were engineers Theodore Ellis and William Worthen. The investigation proceeded quickly and its report was published within a month of the disaster. It concluded that no engineer was responsible for the design and that it was the “work of non-professional persons”. “The remains of the dam indicate defects of workmanship of the grossest character.”

Francis originated scientific methods of testing hydraulic machinery, and was a founding member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and its president in 1880.

===Francis formula===
In 1883, Francis completed his calculation standards for water flow rates, now known as the &quot;Francis equation&quot; or &quot;Francis formula&quot;, usually used in fluid dynamics in conjunction with calculating weirs. The equation is

formula_1 

where:
Q is the discharge in cubic feet per second over the weir, 

L is the length of the weir in feet, and 

h1 is the height of the water above the top of the weir.

He remained at the Locks and Canal Company for his entire career, until retirement in 1884 at the age of 69, and remained on as a consultant right up until his death. His son James took over as chief engineer. The rest of his life he spent with his wife Sarah, and their six children in their home on Worthen Street, which was Whistler&#x27;s old home and now is the Whistler House Museum of Art.

Francis was called to duty in 1889 as a member of an ASCE committee to examine the cause of the Johnstown Flood disaster when the South Fork Dam in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, broke, killing over 2,200 people.  Although the report was completed by January 1890, it was immediately suppressed and not released to other ASCE members or the public until mid-1891, two years after the 1889 flood.  Francis himself presented the results of the investigation at the ASCE convention in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The other three committee members did not attend.  Although Francis’ name headed the report, the &quot;de facto&quot; chairman of the committee was Max Becker, a railroad engineer based in Pittsburgh with virtually no experience in dams or hydraulic engineering.  According to Francis, it was Becker who delayed the release of the report.  A detailed discussion of the South Fork investigation, the participating engineers, and the science behind the 1889 flood was published in 2018.

Francis died on September 18, 1892, at the age of 77, and is buried at Lowell Cemetery under a massive pillar of cut granite stones, symbolizing the stones used to make the canals.

==Honors==
For all his contributions to the world of engineering and his personal generosity, the following are named in his honor:
* James B. Francis College of Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell; Masters, Ph.D and D.Eng. Engineering degrees and research in over seven Engineering programs, including Plastics and Nuclear Engineering.
* Francis Gate, Lowell, Massachusetts
* Francis turbine
* Francis system: an early fire protection sprinkler system
* Francis formula: describes water as it goes over dams. It is used today in fluid mechanics as an equation for the calculation of water flow rate over a rectangular weir in terms of length and head.

==Notable uses of the Francis turbine==

Today, the Francis turbine is the most widely used water turbine in the world, including China&#x27;s new Three Gorges Dam as the world&#x27;s second largest hydroelectric power station in the world, with a future installed capacity of 22,500 MW. With the incorporation of the Francis turbine into almost every hydroelectric dam built since 1900, it is responsible for generating almost one fifth of all the world&#x27;s electricity:

* Älvkarleby Hydroelectric Power Station 1911, in Sweden – early hydroelectric plant in country
* Hoover Dam 1936, Nevada/Arizona – 2,080 MW, world-renowned and once the largest hydroelectric power station in the world
* Grand Coulee Dam 1942, in Washington – 6,809 MW, largest power station in country
* Dez Dam 1963, in Iran – 520 MW, major project in country at time of construction
* Gordon Dam 1978, in Tasmania – 432 MW, tallest dam in country
* Dalešice Hydro Power Plant 1978, in Czech Republic – 480 MW, tallest dam in country
* Jinping-I Dam 2013, in China – 3,600 MW, tallest dam in the world
* Robert-Bourassa generating station 1981, in Canada – 5,616 MW, largest power station in country
* Itaipu Dam 1984, in Brazil/Paraguay –14,000 MW, largest power station in the Americas
* Victoria Dam 1985, in Sri Lanka – 210 MW, tallest dam in country

<text>is an erotic simulation game by Kōei,
released for the PC-8801 computer in April 1982.

It was one of the earliest commercial Japanese erotic computer games, featuring sexually explicit images, and a precursor to the modern eroge genre. &quot;Night Life&quot; was marketed as an aid for the sex life of couples. It included such features as a schedule to determine a woman&#x27;s period, and a catalog of possible sexual positions, with artwork consisting of black-and-white outlines.

The PC-8801 version got an English translation patch on May 19, 2022.

<text>Walter Frederick Gale (27 November 1865 – 1 June 1945) was an Australian banker. Gale was born in Paddington, Sydney, New South Wales. He had a strong interest in astronomy and built his first telescope in 1884.

He discovered a number of comets, including the lost periodic comet 34D/Gale. He also discovered five southern double stars with the prefix GLE, and several dark sky objects, including the planetary nebula, IC 5148 in Grus. In 1892, he described oases and canals on Mars. He was awarded the Jackson-Gwilt Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1935 for &quot;discoveries of comets and his work for astronomy in New South Wales.&quot;

A crater on Mars, Gale, was named in his honour. It was selected as the 2012 landing site for the Curiosity Rover.

<doc id="834684" wikidata="Q5595048" url="?curid=834684" title="Grand River Hospital">
<text>Grand River Hospital is a hospital located in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. The hospital operates two campuses, Kitchener-Waterloo Health Centre and Freeport Health Centre, which were independent hospitals that merged to form Grand River Hospital in April 1995.

The hospital has over 650 beds and 15 specialized programs and services: surgery, children&#x27;s program, childbirth, medical imaging, mental health and addictions, withdrawal management, medicine, stroke, complex continuing care, rehabilitation, cancer, critical care, renal, emergency, pharmacy and lab. The hospital also provides renal dialysis and cancer satellite programs in Guelph, Palmerston, Fergus and Mt Forest Centre in Guelph, along with the Hazelglen Outreach Mental Health service in Kitchener.

On September 22, 2019, Grand River Hospital integrated all of their systems into a new central computer system in order to improve efficiency for patient care.

==Hospitals==
===KW Site===
The KW Site of Grand River Hospital was previously known as the K-W Health Centre and the Berlin-Waterloo Hospital. It is located on King Street West, near the Waterloo border, the Ion rapid transit light rail station and the former location of the CTV Kitchener studios. It was founded in 1895 on land donated by entrepreneur Joseph E. Seagram. The Grand River Regional Cancer Centre opened at this site in 2003. The site is supported by the Kitchener Helipad located southeast at the corner of Walter Street and Wellington Street South.

===Freeport Site===
The Freeport Site of Grand River Hospital was previously known as the Freeport Sanitorium. It is located on King Street East on the shore of the Grand River. It was a tuberculosis sanatorium in the early 20th century, and in the late 1980s was transformed into a regional chronic care facility, as a new structure was built onto the previous one, expanding it. Complex continuing care, rehabilitation and the Waterloo-Wellington breast centre are located at this site. In November 2010, a new Specialized Mental Health program opened at Freeport, with all clinical practice based on the &quot;Recovery&quot; philosophy. This service is for patients living with severe and persistent mental illness, who would have previously been sent to London, Ontario.

The unique architecture of Freeport Centre is award winning; &quot;its overall planning concept of simulating a village, complete with a courtyard cum town square, [distinguishes] it from many of its predecessors in long-term care architecture.&quot; This has made it attractive as a filming location, as seen in two movies, &quot;Away from Her&quot;, directed by Sarah Polley; and &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot;, directed by Mike Figgis.

== Mental health ==
Withdrawal Management, located near the KW site at 52 Glasgow, Grand River Hospital supports the only withdrawal management centre within Waterloo-Wellington Regions. This facility has 24 hour monitoring of non-medical withdrawal for men and women, and a day program to help individuals maintain abstinence and help to transition to other community supports.

<text>The Manor House is a Grade II* listed building which can be found on West street within Alford, Lincolnshire, England. It is believed to be the largest thatched manor house in England and was built to a traditional H plan in 1611. It is a very rare example of a composite structure, featuring a wooden frame with reed and plaster (visible from within the house), encased in brick. Ground-floor and first-floor rooms feature design interventions from Georgian through to Victorian times, while the attic floor is virtually untouched since 1611.

The house was possibly built by a John Hopkinson The house owes much of its existence to the wealth of one of its owners, Sir Robert Christopher. Christopher fought for the Royalist cause in the civil war and was knighted by Charles II following the restoration. The house was inherited by his granddaughter, Lucy, who married John Manners, Duke of Rutland. Thereafter Alford Manor House was inhabited by tenants, one of whom was John Higgins, who arrived in about 1820. He was a friend of Charles Darwin&#x27;s father, Robert, and was the local Land Agent. He established his office in the nineteenth century annex which you can see on the east wing of the house.

It was his descendant, Dorothy Higgins, a doctor and member of Alford Town Council, who bought the property in 1958 and gave it to the town in 1967. Alford Civic Trust was established then to manage and look after the property.

The house itself is unusual in its construction: most properties of the period were built using a wooden frame with wattle and daub infill, or with a brick infill, so that the wooden beams would be visible from the outside as well as from inside the property. However, Alford Manor House was encased in brick, and the brick was not merely ornamental: it was tied into the structure of the building via wall plates and floor joists.

The house was renovated and re-thatched during the period 2004–2006.

The house is owned by Alford and District Civic Trust Ltd which is a Registered Charity (No. 252330).
