<text>Rydal Mount is a house in the small village of Rydal, near Ambleside in the English Lake District. It is best known as the home of the poet William Wordsworth from 1813 to his death in 1850. It is currently operated as a writer&#x27;s home museum.

==History==
Wordsworth was born in Cockermouth in Cumberland in 1770, and knew the Lake District well from his childhood. He moved away to study at the University of Cambridge in 1787, and then travelled in Britain and continental Europe for 12 years. He spent over 8 years at Dove Cottage in nearby Grasmere from 1799 to 1808, but was forced to move to accommodate his growing family and many visitors. After a period in Allan Bank in Grasmere, the Wordsworths moved to Rydal Mount in 1813 which remained their home until their deaths.

Both Grasmere and Windermere lakes can be seen from the hillside grounds of Rydal Mount. William designed the layout of the gardens at Rydal, and he often said that those grounds were his office as opposed to the spacious office/writing room in his house. On the high side of the grounds, tucked away from the main house, but overlooking both the grounds and the two nearby lakes, he built the &quot;Writing Hut&quot; where he spent most of his writing time. This hut consisted merely of a bench with a small roof, but it provided shelter from the frequent rains and escape from the house. He frequently was visited by Samuel Taylor Coleridge who would walk down from his home in Keswick.

Wordsworth died in 1850 and Mary in 1859. Rydal Mount was acquired in 1969 by Mary Henderson (&quot;née&quot; Wordsworth), William&#x27;s great great granddaughter. It remains in the ownership of the Wordsworth family, and has been opened to the public since 1970. Rydal Mount is a Grade I listed building.

<text>AM Radio is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles.

== History ==
AM Radio, formed in Los Angeles in late 2001 and were formed by former Ridel High songwriter Kevin Ridel after his previous band Peel ended, he brought drummer Joe Higgins with him. The band released one album with major label Elektra Records and were once managed by Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo

===Debut album===

After forming in 2001 the band quickly recorded and released a self-titled album on Kevin Ridel&#x27;s own label titled &quot;AM Radio&quot;; it has 10 tracks. The band were helped forming by Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, Rivers also managed the band for a short time until 2003.

In 2002, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo invited AM Radio to open for Weezer&#x27;s big summer tours Dusty West Tour, Japan World Cup Tour, and the Enlightenment Tour. After tours road with Weezer, Third Eye Blind, Eve 6, and The Psychedelic Furs, AM Radio was signed by Elektra Records and released their 2nd album Radioactive.

The release of &quot;Radioactive&quot; was supported by singles &quot;Taken for a Ride&quot; and &quot;I Just Wanna Be Loved.&quot; &quot;I Just Wanna Be Loved&quot; was featured on &quot;Smallville&quot;, a hit TV series on The WB, and released on the show&#x27;s soundtrack. Also in 2003, &quot;Taken for a Ride&quot; was featured on the videogame soundtrack for EA Sports’ &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;. The band received more support from The WB when &quot;Taken for a Ride&quot; was featured on an episode of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. The song appeared on a television trailer for the FOX feature film &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; in the same year.

===3rd album===

After their major label release &quot;Radioactive,&quot; the band recorded many demos for a planned 3rd album.

AM Radio redirected its musical efforts overseas and pursued a record label with Polydor Records in Japan. Many of the demos tracks recorded for the 3rd album would go on to appear on the rarities release &quot;Reactive.&quot; It was around this time the band lost bassist Bryce Soderberg who joined Lifehouse. Ridel signed with Sony Publishing Japan and pursued other Japanese side projects as well.

During that time Ridel experimented with a more synth pop sound for the band and brought in new members keyboardist Francesca Po, Dan Flutur on guitar and Juan Ramirez on drums; songs which were rerecorded included tracks &quot;Hush&quot; from &quot;Radioactive&quot; and &quot;Grapevine&quot; from &quot;Reactive&quot;.

===4th Album as a two piece===

After a string of small club tours in Los Angeles and a handful of band rehearsals, Ridel and current AM Radio member Jason Moore began a project entitled &quot;Jason Feat Kevin,&quot; commonly referred to by the band as &quot;JFK.&quot; The duo then restarted AM Radio in mid/2008 and pursued both groups. In December of that same year, it was announced that AM Radio would record a new album. About a year later, in November, &quot;Bigger Better Bolder Brighter&quot; (&quot;BBBB&quot;) was released without the help of a record label.

Ridel described their writing process for this album on the band&#x27;s MySpace blog:

&quot;We&#x27;re using a new songwriting formula for this one. First, Jason writes and records the music. Then he sends it over for me to sing and put lyrics to. It&#x27;s really a fun and inspiring process. J&#x27;s tracks make me stand up and shout, &quot;Yea!&quot;. In the same blog entry, Ridel talked about their choice of producer.

He said, &quot;The working title &quot;Bigger Better Bolder Brighter&quot; is ironic in that we are recording the entire album on our home computers, as opposed to using an expensive studio with a big budget producer.&quot;

===Currently===

AM Radio recently released their 5th album &quot;Shine&quot; which was produced by Emmy Award-winning producer Matt Corey; the album also featured longtime friend and former Nerf Herder bassist Justin Fisher

<doc id="826384" wikidata="Q7535959" url="?curid=826384" title="Skitching">
<text>Skitching (abbreviated from &quot;skate-hitching&quot;, pron: /ˈskɪtʃɪŋ/) is the act of hitching a ride by holding onto a motor vehicle while riding on a skateboard, roller skates, bicycle, or sneakers when there is snowfall. It is also sometimes referred to as bum-riding or hooky bobbing when being towed over snowy or icy streets on boots or a sled. In addition, skitching can be performed on a bicycle or inner tube.

==Dangers==
Because skitching is often done in traffic, on inadequate equipment for the speeds travelled, and sometimes without the knowledge of the driver of the vehicle, there is significant potential for injury or death. The skateboarding advocacy group Skaters for Public Skateparks reported that 2 of 42 skateboarding deaths in 2011 in the United States were skitching-related.

Skateboarding celebrity Tony Hawk has advocated against the practice of skitching due to the related deaths and injuries.

==Cultural references==

===In film and television===
Michael J. Fox can be seen skitching in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, as can Michael Beck in the 1980 film &quot;Xanadu&quot; and Christian Slater in the 1989 film &quot;Gleaming the Cube&quot; and also in the 2016 film &quot;Nerve&quot; as a dangerous stunt. It was portrayed in &quot;Biker Boyz&quot; (2003), &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot; (2005), &quot;Premium Rush&quot; (2012), and season 1 of &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2015) as well.

===In literature===
* In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot; skateboard Kouriers use a magnetic harpoon to skitch.

===In video games===
* The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis 1994 video game &quot;Skitchin&#x27;&quot; involves racing against other skitchers.
* The 2002 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; and subsequent games also feature skitching.
* Skitching is featured in the game &quot;Jet Grind Radio&quot;.
* &quot;Bully&quot; also features skitching after receiving the skateboard.
* Skitching is also possible in &quot;Skate 3&quot;.
* Skitching is also included in &quot;Aggressive Inline&quot;.

<doc id="826386" wikidata="Q2411938" url="?curid=826386" title="Lawrence Payton">
<text>Lawrence Albert Payton Sr. (March 2, 1938 – June 20, 1997) was an American tenor, songwriter, vocal arranger, musician, and record producer for the popular Motown quartet, the Four Tops.

==Career==
Payton and Obie Benson both attended a Northern High School in Detroit and met Levi Stubbs and Duke Fakir at a school birthday party. The four teenagers began singing in 1953 as The Four Aims but later changed their name to the Four Tops to avoid confusion with the Ames Brothers. With the help of Payton&#x27;s songwriter cousin Billy Davis, the Aims signed to Chess Records in 1956. Although successful in the local area as a performance group, recording success eluded them until signing with the newly established Motown label in 1963. They then became one of the biggest recording acts of the 1960s, charting more than two dozen hits through the early 1980s.
Payton is credited for the vocal arrangements and the &quot;smooth seamless harmony&quot; of the Four Tops&#x27; sound. He also sang lead on several songs such as the 1975 single &quot;We All Gotta Stick Together&quot;, &quot;Feel Free&quot; (from the &quot;Catfish&quot; album) and &quot;Love Feels Like Fire&quot; and &quot;Until You Love Someone&quot; (from their Motown days), but he was often overshadowed as lead by the more popular Stubbs. Stubbs praised Payton&#x27;s contribution saying, &quot;He could pick notes out of the air. He had that gift. He was responsible for our harmonies.&quot;

==Personal life==
The original Four Tops enjoyed continued success as a headline performance act and remained together for 43 years until Payton&#x27;s death on June 20, 1997, from liver cancer in Southfield, Michigan aged 59. He was interred in Detroit&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery.

Payton had 11 children. One of his sons, Lawrence Jr., nicknamed &quot;Roquel&quot;, went on to sing with the Four Tops who continue to perform as of , and still featuring original member Duke Fakir until his death in 2024.

==Accolades==
As a member of the Four Tops, Payton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame shortly before his death in 1997, was posthumously inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009, and was ranked at number 77 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Top 100 Recording Artists of All Time. 2013 the group was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame

<text>California cuisine is a food movement that originated in  Northern California. The cuisine focuses on dishes that are driven by local and sustainable ingredients with an attention to seasonality and an emphasis on the bounty of the region.

The food is historically chef-driven; Alice Waters&#x27;s restaurant Chez Panisse is an iconic example. Dishes and meals low in saturated fats and high in fresh vegetables and fruits with lean meats and seafood from the California coast often define the style. 

The term &quot;California cuisine&quot; arose as a result of culinary movements in the last decades of the 20th century and is not to be confused with the traditional foods of California. California fusion cuisine has been influenced by French cuisine, American cuisine, Italian cuisine, Mexican cuisine, Chinese cuisine, among other food cultures.

==History==
One of the first proponents of using fresh, locally available foods was Helen Evans Brown, who became friends with James Beard after publishing &quot;Helen Brown&#x27;s West Coast Cookbook&quot; in 1952. She advocated using fruits and spices available in one&#x27;s neighborhood, forgoing poor grocery store substitutes, as well as fresh seafood, caught locally. 

The book received wide acclaim and became the &quot;template&quot; for what is now thought of as California cuisine.
Alice Waters, who opened Chez Panisse restaurant in 1971 in Berkeley, California, has contributed significantly to the concept of California Cuisine. 

About the same time, in Yountville in the Napa Valley, Sally Schmitt began serving single-menu monthly dinners that emphasized local ingredients, continuing the concept when she and her husband Don opened The French Laundry in 1978. 

In Los Angeles, Wolfgang Puck was also an early pioneer of California cuisine; starting with his work at Patrick Terrail&#x27;s Ma Maison, and further work with Ed LaDou on California-style pizza at Spago and Asian fusion at Chinois on Main. 

Mark Peel, who worked for both Waters and Puck, went on to co-found La Brea Bakery and Campanile Restaurant with his then-wife Nancy Silverton. As executive chef, he mentored other up-and-coming chefs. “Campanile has played an important role in shaping the cuisine of Southern California and beyond, not just through its menu but also through the many graduates of its kitchen.” 

Daniel Patterson, a more modern proponent of the style, emphasizes vegetables and foraged foods while maintaining the traditional emphasis on local foods and presentation.

California-style pizza was popularized by Alice Waters, Ed LaDou and Wolfgang Puck, and became a national trend in the United States; pizzas focus less on tradition and more on creativity and California-grown ingredients.

<doc id="826390" wikidata="Q2300865" url="?curid=826390" title="Iochroma">
<text>Iochroma is a genus of about 34 species of shrubs and small trees belonging to the nightshade family Solanaceae. Species are native from Mexico to south Brazil. They are found in the forests of Mexico and South America. Their hummingbird-pollinated flowers are tubular or trumpet-shaped, and may be blue, purple, red, yellow, or white, becoming pulpy berries. The cupular (cup-shaped) calyx is inflated in some species. The leaves are alternate, simple, and entire.

Iochromas are cultivated as flowering ornamentals and in cooler zones (zones 7–8/9) make useful patio shrubs for summer display or conservatory plants. The majority are not frost-hardy and must be overwintered under protection. In warmer zones (zones 9–10) they can be used as landscape plants. They are commonly trained as standards (topiary) to control their size and shape. Iochroma flowers attract hummingbirds (Americas only) and bees to gardens.

Like many plants in the Solanaceae, &quot;Iochroma&quot; species contain phytochemicals with potential pharmaceutical value but the genus has not been exhaustively studied in this respect. &quot;Iochroma fuchsioides&quot; is taken by the medicine men of the Kamsa Indians of the Sibundoy valley in the Colombian Andes for difficult diagnoses, the unpleasant side effects lasting several days. A variety of withanolides and hydroxycinnamic acid amides have been isolated from &quot;Iochroma&quot; species.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Iochroma&quot; was established by George Bentham in 1845. Like other plant families, the Solanaceae is further divided into subfamilies, tribes and subtribes. &quot;Iochroma&quot; is in the subtribe Iochrominae along with the genera &quot;Dunalia&quot;, &quot;Eriolarynx&quot;, &quot;Saracha&quot; and &quot;Vassobia&quot;. , &quot;Acnistus&quot;, previously treated as a separate genus, was regarded as a synonym of &quot;Iochroma&quot;.

<text>Barinas () is a city in west central Venezuela. According to the 2011 census, its population is 353,442. It is the capital of the Barinas Municipality and the State of Barinas. The city of Barinas is known as the capital of the Llanos.

== History ==
The original city was founded under the name &quot;Altamira de Caceres&quot; on June 30, 1577, by Captain Juan Andres Varela fulfilling orders of the governor of La Grita Francisco de Cáceres, who had founded this Andean city and established it governorate in 1576.

In 1786 Barinas state was established in the territories of the existing states of Barinas and Apure. The city became the capital of the state and an important bastion of the patriots during the War of Independence. Cristóbal Mendoza, the first President of Venezuela, lived and practiced his profession in Barinas.

== Etymology ==
The name of the city comes from an indigenous word which identifies a strong wind that occurs during the rainy season, from the valleys of Santo Domingo.

<text>The Surrealist Manifesto refers to several publications by Yvan Goll and André Breton, leaders of rival surrealist groups. Goll and Breton both published manifestos in October 1924 titled &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot;. Breton wrote a second manifesto in 1929, which was published the following year, and in 1942, a reflection or a commentary on the potential for a third manifesto, exploring how the Surrealist movement might adapt to changing times.

==History==

By 1924, two rival surrealist groups had formed, each claiming to be a successor of the legacy of Guillaume Apollinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll, included Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Dermée, Céline Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlevé and Robert Delaunay. The other group, led by Breton, included Louis Aragon, Robert Desnos, Paul Éluard, Jacques Baron, Jacques-André Boiffard, Jean Carrive, René Crevel, and Georges Malkine.

Goll published his &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot; on October 1, 1924, in the only issue of the journal &quot;Surréalisme&quot;. Two weeks later, on October 15, Breton&#x27;s &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot; was published by Éditions du Sagittaire.

Goll and Breton&#x27;s conflicting beliefs led to a quarrel at the Comédie des Champs-Élysées over the rights to the term &quot;surrealism&quot;. Later sources describe Breton as having won. Many surrealists accepted Breton&#x27;s definition while holding individual beliefs on the issues and goals of the movement.

==Breton&#x27;s 1924 manifesto==

Breton&#x27;s first manifesto defines surrealism as

The text includes examples of applications of surrealism in poetry and literature and maintains that its tenets can be applied outside of the arts. Breton notes hypnagogia as a surreal state and the dream as a source of inspiration. The manifesto concludes that surrealism is non-conformist in nature and does not follow defined rules. It was written in an absurdist manner influenced by Dadaism.

The manifesto references the works of Marquis de Sade, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, Comte de Lautréamont, Raymond Roussel, and Dante as precursors to surrealism and the poetry of Philippe Soupault, Paul Éluard, Robert Desnos and Louis Aragon as surrealist.

The manifesto named Louis Aragon, André Breton, Robert Desnos, Paul Éluard, Jacques Baron, Jacques-André Boiffard, Jean Carrive, René Crevel and Georges Malkine as members of the surrealist movement.

==Breton&#x27;s later manifestos==
In 1929, Breton sent letters to surrealists asking them to evaluate their &quot;degree of moral competence&quot;; later that year, he published the &quot;Second manifeste du surréalisme&quot;. The manifesto expelled surrealists hesitant to commit to collective action, including Baron, Robert Desno, Boiffard, Michel Leiris, Raymond Queneau, Jacques Prévert and André Masson. A printed insert was published with the manifesto that was signed by the surrealists who supported Breton and agreed to participate in &quot;Surrealism at the Service of the Revolution&quot;. This group of surrealists included Maxime Alexander, Louis Aragon, Joe Bousquet, Luis Buñuel, René Char, René Crevel, Salvador Dalí, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst, Marcel Fourrier, Camille Goemans, Paul Nougé, Benjamin Péret, Francis Ponge, Marko Ristić, Georges Sadoul, Yves Tanguy, André Thirion, Tristan Tzara and Albert Valentin. Along with Ristić, the Belgrade surrealists grouped around &quot;Nadrealista Danas i Ovde&quot; were aligned with Breton.

A group of those expelled by Breton founded the magazine &quot;Documents.&quot; It was edited by Georges Bataille, whose philosophy of anti-idealist materialism encouraged surrealism focused on human base instincts.

Breton did not write a third manifesto, or at least publish it, though he did publish a “Prolegomena to a Third Manifesto or Not” (1942), a reflection or a commentary on the potential for a third manifesto, exploring how the Surrealist movement might adapt to changing times.

<text>Collateral is a 2004 American neo-noir action thriller film directed and produced by Michael Mann, written by Stuart Beattie, and starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. The supporting cast includes Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Bardem, and Bruce McGill. The film follows Max Durocher (Foxx), a Los Angeles cab driver, and his customer, Vincent (Cruise). When offered a high fare for driving to several locations, Max agrees but soon finds himself taken hostage by Vincent who turns out to be a hitman on a contract killing spree.

Beattie first conceived the idea for the film when taking a taxicab home from Sydney airport. He shared the idea with producer Julie Richardson, who showed it to director Frank Darabont. The film was pitched to HBO but was declined. It was purchased by DreamWorks but would not see development for three years. Before the trio of Mann, Cruise and Foxx joined the film, Mimi Leder, Janusz Kamiński and Fernando Meirelles were each considered as director, and Russell Crowe and Adam Sandler were in talks to star as Vincent and Max, respectively. Filming primarily took place throughout Los Angeles, and was the first feature film to be shot with a Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera. The musical score was composed by James Newton Howard, with additional songs from Audioslave and Paul Oakenfold.

&quot;Collateral&quot; was released in the United States on August 6, 2004, and grossed over $220 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim in particular for the performances of Cruise and Foxx, Mann&#x27;s direction, and the editing. &quot;Collateral&quot; was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2004. At the 77th Academy Awards, Foxx received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, while film editors Jim Miller and Paul Rubell were nominated for Best Film Editing.

==Plot==
Max Durocher is a Los Angeles cab driver trying to earn enough to start his own limousine business. One of the evening&#x27;s fares is federal prosecutor Annie Farrell, who works for the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California. They strike up a conversation and Annie gives Max her business card.

Max&#x27;s next fare is Vincent, who tells Max that he is in Los Angeles for one night to complete a real estate deal, and Max agrees to drive him to several locations. As Max waits at the first stop, a corpse falls onto his car. Vincent reveals himself to be a hitman. He forces Max to hide the body in the trunk and continue driving. LAPD detective Ray Fanning arrives where Vincent made the kill and reveals the victim was a police informant.

At the second stop, Vincent restrains Max&#x27;s hands to the steering wheel. While Vincent is away, Max tries to use the horn to signal for help. Two young men come around to the car to rob him and seize Vincent&#x27;s briefcase. Vincent shoots them dead and retrieves the briefcase. Fanning arrives at the hospital morgue to see the bodies of criminal lawyer Sylvester Clark, Vincent&#x27;s second target, and the two dead robbers, and realizes that this is the work of a hitman.

Vincent orders Max to a jazz club to find his third target, Daniel, who is set to testify against Vincent&#x27;s client. Max pleads with Vincent to let Daniel go, and Vincent bets that Daniel cannot answer a question about Miles Davis. Daniel seemingly gives a correct answer, but Vincent unexpectedly shoots Daniel in the head, dissatisfied with his answer.

Learning of Max&#x27;s nightly visits to the hospital to see his mother, Vincent insists that Max proceed with the visit. At the hospital, Ida proudly tells Vincent that Max has his own limousine company, revealing Max has been lying to her for her approval.

Overwhelmed, Max leaves, steals Vincent&#x27;s briefcase, and hurls it onto a freeway where it is destroyed. Vincent coerces Max to meet drug lord Felix Reyes-Torrena to re-obtain the information on his last two targets. Max, posing as Vincent, acquires the information but Reyes-Torrena orders his men to kill &quot;Vincent&quot; if he does not complete the job.

Max goes with Vincent to a nightclub, seeking the next target, Peter Lim. Fanning, while seeking a connection between the three victims, visits FBI agent Frank Pedrosa, who identifies the victims as witnesses in a federal grand jury which will indict Reyes-Torrena the following day. Pedrosa thinks that Max is the hitman, based on FBI surveillance of Max entering and leaving Reyes-Torrena&#x27;s bar, and orders the FBI agents to protect Lim. At the nightclub, Vincent kills Reyes-Torrena&#x27;s hitmen, Lim, and his bodyguards. Fanning rescues Max and smuggles him outside, but Vincent fatally shoots Fanning and coerces Max back into the cab.

Following their getaway, Max chastises Vincent for his lack of a moral compass. Vincent snaps back by arguing Max has been lying to himself about wanting to start his limousine business, using it as an excuse to avoid taking risks in life. Agreeing with Vincent, Max deliberately crashes the cab. Vincent escapes, but a police officer tries to arrest Max after seeing the corpse in the trunk. Max notices Vincent&#x27;s list of targets, revealing that his final target is Annie. Max overpowers the police officer with Vincent&#x27;s gun and rushes toward Annie&#x27;s office building.

Stealing a bystander&#x27;s phone, Max calls Annie to warn her, urging her to call 911. Vincent arms himself with a gun from a security guard and corners Annie, but he is shot and wounded by Max, who escapes with Annie on foot. Vincent pursues the pair onto a metro rail train. Cornered on the train, Max engages Vincent in a shootout. Vincent, fatally wounded, slumps into a seat. Max and Annie get off at the next station, as a deceased Vincent continues riding alone on the train.

==Production==
===Development===
When he was 17 years old, Australian writer Stuart Beattie took a cab home from Sydney airport and had the idea of a homicidal maniac sitting in the back of a cab with the driver nonchalantly conversing with him, trusting his passenger implicitly. Beattie drafted his idea into a two-page treatment titled &quot;The Last Domino&quot;, then later began writing the screenplay. The original story centered around an African-American female cop who witnesses a hit, and the romance between the cab driver and his then librarian girlfriend. The final film has limited resemblance to the original treatment.

Beattie was waiting tables when he came in to contact with Julie Richardson, whom he had met on a UCLA Screenwriting Extension course. Richardson had become a producer and was searching for projects for Frank Darabont, Rob Fried and Chuck Russell&#x27;s company, Edge City, which was created to make low budget genre films for HBO. Beattie later pitched her his idea of &quot;The Last Domino&quot;. Richardson pitched the idea to Darabont, who brought the team in for a meeting, including Beattie, and set up the project under Edge City. After two drafts, HBO passed on the project.

At a general meeting at DreamWorks with executive Marc Haimes, Beattie mentioned the script. Haimes immediately contacted Richardson, read the script overnight, and DreamWorks put in an offer the following day. Early drafts of &quot;Collateral&quot;″s script set the film in New York City. Later revisions of the script moved the film&#x27;s setting to Los Angeles. Darabont, Fried and Russell would remain on as executive producers.

===Pre-production===

Mimi Leder and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński were attached to the project at one point as the director. Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles had initially agreed to direct, but eventually decided to exit as the production would require him to relocate to Los Angeles for eight months. Meirelles described his vision for the film as being that of a comedy, and looked at telling it in a way similar to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot;.

Upon Russell Crowe expressing interest in playing the role of Vincent, development on the film moved forward. Crowe got his &quot;The Insider&quot; director Michael Mann involved, but after constant delays, Crowe departed the project. Mann explained that the confined time frame and smaller scale of the film in comparison to previous efforts like &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot; were what drew him to the project. Mann then approached Tom Cruise with the idea of him playing Vincent and Adam Sandler in the role of Max. Sandler later dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Spanglish&quot; and was replaced by Jamie Foxx. Beattie wanted the studio to cast Robert De Niro as Max, once again making him a taxi driver, though the exact opposite of Travis Bickle. The studio refused, insisting on a younger actor for the role.

To prepare for the role of Vincent, Tom Cruise watched a few movies about professional killers such as Jean-Pierre Melville’s &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (starring Alain Delon), with Cruise describing his fascination with the &quot;solitary and melancholic charisma in carrying out his cruel affairs.” Cruise’s appearance and character in the American film are also reminiscent of the character played by Delon in that film.

Cuba Gooding Jr. revealed in a 2018 interview he had turned down a part in the film due to concerns he would be miscast. Mann&#x27;s reasons for casting Foxx, with whom he worked with on &quot;Ali&quot;, was that he held a similar quality in his performances to Cruise. &quot;I saw that [quality of Tom&#x27;s] in Jamie on &quot;In Living Color&quot; — his characters were so vivid. That&#x27;s why I went after him for [cornerman] Bundini Brown in &quot;Ali&quot;. Jamie starts with mimicry, but then he talks about &quot;putting it into the database&quot;, so he can access a character once he&#x27;s got it down&quot;. To prepare for his role, Cruise worked covertly as a FedEx deliveryman. Mann stated the goal was for Cruise to not be recognized. Mann would also have Cruise train in firearm use with a retired SAS soldier, and would take Foxx on shifts with real cab drivers to enhance Foxx&#x27;s understanding of the work.

Jada Pinkett Smith, cast in the role of Annie, spent time with an attorney to inform her performance. Val Kilmer was originally cast in the film as Detective Fanning, but exited to star in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&quot;, resulting in Mark Ruffalo taking on the role instead. In a similar situation, Dennis Farina, initially cast as Agent Pedrosa, had to exit due to scheduling conflicts with the television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and was recast with Bruce McGill. Javier Bardem was cast in what was described as &quot;a small role&quot; at the time. Jason Statham made a small appearance in a role credited as &quot;Airport Man&quot;, briefly interacting with Cruise at the opening of the film. Louis Leterrier, co-director of the 2002 action film &quot;The Transporter&quot;, interpreted Statham&#x27;s scene as a portrayal of his &quot;Transporter&quot; character Frank Martin.

===Filming===
After three weeks of filming, cinematographer Paul Cameron left the project due to creative differences with Mann. Dion Beebe was brought on to replace Cameron. Mann chose to use the Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera to film many of &quot;Collateral&quot; scenes, the first such use in a major motion picture. Mann had previously used the format for portions of &quot;Ali&quot; and his CBS drama &quot;Robbery Homicide Division&quot; and would later employ the same camera for the filming of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The sequence in the nightclub was shot in 35 mm.

Filming took place throughout Los Angeles, with Los Angeles International Airport and Koreatown used for setpieces, and filming was also done in Pico Rivera, California.

==Music==
James Newton Howard composed the score for the film, with additional music by Antônio Pinto. As well as the Vangelis composition &quot;Moxica and the Horse,&quot; which was composed for the film &quot;1492 Conquest of Paradise.&quot; The piece features in &quot;Collateral&quot; as the FBI race to the Fever nightclub. The &quot;Collateral&quot; soundtrack was released on August 3, 2004, by Hip-O Records, one notable omission from the soundtrack release is Tom Rothrock&#x27;s &quot;LAX&quot; which plays as several parties head to the nightclub. Howard estimated that only half of the music he composed was used in the final cut of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on August 6, 2004, in 3,188 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed approximately $24.7 million on its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office. It remained in theaters for 14 weeks and eventually grossed $101,005,703 in the U.S. and Canada. In other countries, it grossed $119,920,992 for a worldwide $220,926,695.

===Critical response===

&quot;Collateral&quot; received positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 238 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The critical consensus states that &quot;Driven by director Michael Mann&#x27;s trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, &quot;Collateral&quot; is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 71 out of 100, based on 41 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film and Cruise&#x27;s performance. He summarized the film as &quot;the best kind of genre filmmaking: It plays by the rules, obeys the traditions and is both familiar and fresh at once&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying Mann&#x27;s direction and insightful dialogue elevated &quot;Collateral&quot; above its genre roots. He also praised the performances of Cruise and Foxx, calling Foxx&#x27;s dramatic performance a &quot;revelation&quot; after establishing himself as a comedian. In addition to praising the performances of Cruise, Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote of Foxx&#x27;s performance: &quot;Foxx can act. He&#x27;s up to the role&#x27;s demands, conveying fear, confusion and frustration, but more important the exhaustion and recklessness that can easily follow when someone&#x27;s been scared for so long&quot;.

Desson Thomson gave similar praise to Foxx, finding the actor &quot;quietly pries the movie from Cruise&#x27;s big-marquee fingers&quot;. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; praised the film, although he criticized its third act as &quot;generic and farfetched&quot;. Placing the film on his best of the year list, Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the acting in addition to Mann&#x27;s direction and Beattie&#x27;s screenplay, despite finding logical inconsistencies in the plot and that it &quot;does not have quite enough completely compelling incidents to sustain its considerable length&quot;.

In a mixed review, Marrit Ingman of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; gave positive remarks to Mann&#x27;s film-making, but stated &quot;There&#x27;s not much substance lurking beneath all the style, though the plot digresses into several awkward scenes intended to flesh out the characters&quot;. David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; magazine highlighted Foxx&#x27;s performance as &quot;terrific&quot; and was favorable to the film&#x27;s first act, but derided the rest of the film. &quot;It&#x27;s too bad that halfway through, &quot;Collateral&quot; turns into a series of loud, chaotic, over-the-top action set pieces in which the existentialist Mann proves he&#x27;s lousy at action&quot;. Edelstein also criticized the performance of Cruise, referring to his performance as &quot;robotic&quot;.

Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine criticized Cruise&#x27;s performance, finding that &quot;Cruise&#x27;s dignity rings stiff and false&quot;. Zacharek did praise the performance of Foxx, stating &quot;Foxx inhabits his character so comfortably that he renders meaningless Vincent&#x27;s babble about the tough, real world. Max is the one who lives in the real world, which is ultimately the point of the movie -- but it takes the picture a very long time to reach a conclusion that&#x27;s evident from the start to any attuned viewer&quot;.

Richard Roeper placed &quot;Collateral&quot; as his 10th favorite film of 2004. In 2008, the film was voted as the 9th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors with two criteria: &quot;The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list&quot;.

<doc id="826410" wikidata="Q5499942" url="?curid=826410" title="Free Peace Sweet">
<text>Free Peace Sweet is the third studio album by English rock band Dodgy. It was released on 17 June 1996 through A&amp;M Records. Following frequent touring in the support of their second studio album &quot;Homegrown&quot; (1994), the band recorded its follow-up in Wessex Sound Studios in London with producer Hugh Jones. Additional recording was later done at Battery and Orinoco Studios.

&quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics, some of who saw it as a strong but underwhelming collection of songs. The album reached number seven in the UK Albums Chart, eventually being certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Out of all its singles, &quot;Good Enough&quot; peaked the highest at number 4 in the UK. Bookending a three month UK tour, &quot;In a Room&quot; and &quot;Good Enough&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first two singles in May and July 1996, respectively. &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot; and &quot;Found You&quot; followed as the third and fourth singles in November 1996 and March 1997. &quot;Good Enough&quot; would be certified silver by the BPI in 2015.

==Background and recording==
Dodgy released their second studio album &quot;Homegrown&quot; in October 1994. It peaked at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart; all of its singles peaked within the UK top 40, with an alternative version of &quot;Staying Out for the Summer&quot; reaching the highest at number 19. The album was promoted with a UK tour at the end of 1994, and constant touring throughout 1995, which included their first tour to mainland Europe and Japan, as well as supporting the Cranberries in the UK. Frontman Nigel Clark lived in a flat in Primrose Hill with his pregnant wife; he wrote new material and demoed songs on a TASCAM four-track recorder. They had 35 songs in the running for inclusion on their next album, which were eventually whittled down. &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; was produced by Hugh Jones at Wessex Sound Studios in London with engineer Robin Evans.

They picked this studio so that Clark could return to his family each night, having moved to the Stoke Newington district of London. The close proximity also enabled Clark to spend evenings writing more material with the intention of showing the other members his work the very next day. While &quot;Homegrown&quot; was recorded with a basic band set up, for &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot;, they used different methods of recording. For &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Longer Asking&quot;, this meant set up with a PA system, playing the drum track through this and recording the output. Additional recording was done at Battery and Orinoco Studios, both which served as the mixing locations for the recordings. Jones did the mixes with engineer Helen Woodward, before the album was mastered by Ian Cooper at Metropolis Studios with digital editing done by Crispin Murray.

==Composition and lyrics==
&quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; is a Britpop album that takes influence from the works of Beastie Boys, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and Dr. John. Long-term live member Richard Payne contributed keyboards throughout the album. Jerome de Pietro did additional programming and remixing on interlude pieces and &quot;Intro&quot;. An ensemble of brass players, under the name The Kick Horns, appeared on &quot;In a Room&quot;, &quot;Good Enough&quot;, &quot;Jack the Lad&quot; and &quot;Homegrown&quot;. They consisted of Tim Sanders, Neil Sidwell, Roddy Lorimer and Simon Clarke. Janet Ramus and Michele Douglas of the London Community Gospel Choir sung additional vocals on &quot;You&#x27;ve Gotta Look Up&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot; and &quot;Prey for Drinking&quot;. Nick Ingman arranged the strings that are heard on &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot;, &quot;One of Those Rivers&quot; and &quot;Long Life&quot;.

&quot;In a Room&quot; originally had a slower tempo, giving the song Neil Young-esque feel to it, until one of the members suggested playing it faster. Both it and &quot;Trust in Time&quot; incorporate influence from the work of the Who. The band came up with the drum pattern for &quot;You&#x27;ve Gotta Look Up&quot; after visiting a go-go club. Guitarist Andy Miller theorised that the vibraphone solo, which was performed by Teena Lyle, might have been inspired by &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; (1994) by Edwyn Collins. The track was an example of Clark coming up with the chorus and version lyrics and drummer Matthew Priest would help finish them; Miller said this happened previously with the &quot;Homegrown&quot; songs &quot;Making the Most Of...&quot; and &quot;So Let Me Go Far&quot;.

The final version of &quot;Good Enough&quot; evolved from a demo that Clark made, which featured a Lee Dorsey drum loop. Clark wanted the song to have a positive atmosphere akin to &quot;Kaya&quot; (1978) by Bob Marley, which is one of Clark&#x27;s favourite albums. He also drew influence from the music of Karen Carpenter and George Harrison. Priest came up with the drum pattern during a break at Wessex Sound Studios, which Clark, Miller and Jones overheard. They promptly expanded on this to a full song. &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Longer Asking&quot; comes across as a mix of &quot;Loser&quot; (1993) by Beck and &quot;Rocks&quot; (1994) by Primal Scream.

Discussing &quot;One of Those Rivers&quot;, Miller said when they were driving through Scotland, their tour manager would take an alternate route via Northumberland. On one occasion, Priest commented on the view he was witnessing; Clark wrote some words down and showed Priest a few months later. He came up with the first verse of what would become &quot;One of Those Rivers&quot;, with Priest writing the other verses. Tim Kent of the Rockingbirds contributed banjo to the song. &quot;Prey for Drinking&quot;, &quot;Jack the Lad&quot; and &quot;Long Life&quot; form a musical suite. &quot;Jack the Lad&quot; dated from five years prior, when their manager once sent the band to a farmhouse in Hendre-Ddu, Wales, where they came up with the basic form of the song. &quot;Consumable Online&quot; writer Tim Kennedy said the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;appear to refer to a certain lad&#x27;s excess and bad behaviour leading to the inevitable&quot;.

Miller thought Clark had his son in mind when writing &quot;Long Life&quot;, alongside &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1944) by George Orwell. &quot;U.K.R.I.P.&quot; retreads the lyrical theme of &quot;Grand Old English Oak Tree&quot; from their debut studio album &quot;The Dodgy Album&quot; (1993), with an emphasis on what Miller saw as &quot;trying to distance ourselves from the jingoistic, xenophobic bullshit that Britpop was throwing up&quot;. He thought they were evoking the Clash &quot;via Future Sound of London and maybe Senser&quot;. Priest wrote the song&#x27;s chorus and second verse, while Clark wrote the first verse. The album&#x27;s closing track &quot;Homegrown&quot; was written before the band&#x27;s album of the same name and did not fit within the rest of that material. They had previously recorded a version of the song at the Tardis studio in Liverpool; as they were unable to replicate of it during the &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; sessions, they opted to take portions of that original recording.

==Release==
&quot;In a Room&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; on 27 May 1996. The 7-inch vinyl version included &quot;Out Clubbing&quot;, while the CD version featured &quot;Self Doubt&quot;, an acoustic version of &quot;Long Life&quot; and a remix of &quot;U.K.R.I.P.&quot; renamed &quot;Jungle UK (No Rest in Peace)&quot;, which was done by Pietro and Phil Mossman. The single was promoted with a short, four date tour of the UK, running into early June 1996. &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; was released on 17 June 1996 through A&amp;M Records. The artwork features a tree, which is a reference to &quot;Grand Old English Oak Tree&quot;. The vinyl version included two extra songs, namely, &quot;Is It Me?&quot; (at the end) and &quot;Grateful Moon&quot; (after &quot;Good Enough&quot;). Between July and September 1996, the band embarked on The Summer Big Top Trip tour across the UK, which included an appearance on the main stage of the Reading Festival, with a variety of supporting acts. &quot;Good Enough&quot; was released as a single on 29 July 1996. The 7-inch vinyl version included &quot;Nutters&quot;, while the CD version featured &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; and &quot;Lovebirds on Katovit&quot;. The music video for &quot;Good Enough&quot; was planned to be filmed in India, before it was ultimately shot in Jamaica. &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot; was released as a single on 4 November 1996. The 7-inch vinyl version included a live acoustic version of &quot;In a Room&quot;, while the CD version featured &quot;Pebblemilljam&quot;, &quot;Forever Remain&quot; and an alternative version of &quot;Good Enough&quot;. The music video for &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot; was filmed in Malta in a pool that was set up specially for filming.

&quot;Found You&quot; was released as a single on 3 March 1997; &quot;You&#x27;ve Gotta Look Up&quot; was in the running to be the fourth single, until &quot;Found You&quot; was ultimately chosen. The 7-inch vinyl version included a cover of the Small Faces&#x27; song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make It&quot; (1967) and a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolution&quot; (1968), while the CD version featured &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make It&quot;, a live version of &quot;Stand by Yourself&quot; and an alternative version of &quot;Found You&quot;. The music video for &quot;Found You&quot; was filmed in Andorra and centred around snowboarding. Mercury Records was planning on releasing the album in the US in March 1997, before being pushed back to May to eventually being shelved. Dodgy&#x27;s co-manager Dave Crompton commented that Mercury planned on releasing a single first but the band was against it, saying: &quot;We think their attitude was, &#x27;We&#x27;ll put it out and see what happens,&#x27; and we said, &#x27;We want to have a career. We&#x27;ve got one in England and Europe, and we want one in the U.S. as well. The band eventually parted ways with Mercury; Crompton and partner Andrew Winters were aiming to find a new label to release the album later in the year.

A&amp;M Records released the &quot;Free Peace Sweet: The Singles Collection&quot; in 1997, which was a box set that encouraged fans to collect all of the singles on CD. It included an exclusive live CD; &quot;In a Room&quot; was recorded at MTV, while &quot;Trust in Time&quot;, &quot;Big Brown Moon&quot; and &quot;Homegrown&quot; were recorded at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. &quot;In a Room&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot;, &quot;Good Enough&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Longer Asking&quot; and &quot;Found You&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;Ace A&#x27;s + Killer B&#x27;s&quot; (1999). &quot;In a Room&quot;, &quot;Good Enough&quot;, &quot;Found You&quot; and &quot;Homegrown&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s second compilation album &quot;The Collection&quot; (2004). &quot;In a Room&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot;, &quot;Good Enough&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Longer Asking&quot;, &quot;Found You&quot; and &quot;Homegrown&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s third compilation album &quot;Good Enough: The Very Best Of&quot; (2013).

==Reception==

&quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. In a review for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine found &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; to not be as &quot;consistently engaging&quot; as its predecessor, and while their &quot;style is beginning to sound a bit formulaic,&quot; he could not deny that they had an &quot;infectious, exciting sound that makes the similarities between their albums forgivable&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; writer Paul Moody thought it was an &quot;exact DNA progression&quot; from their previous two releases; he noted that while there was a variety of musical influences, the album &quot;never threatens to be anything other than a superior example of Bandus Britpopus&quot;.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Caitlin Moran said the album had &quot;enough eclecticism&quot; throughout the songs to &quot;keep even the most gnat-brained, Tartrazine-addled pop-kid stuck in for the full 64 minutes&quot;. Kennedy said it was a &quot;super effort from the Dodgy chaps, proving their versatility, their chart worthiness, but most of all that they can be evil rock beasts like the best of &#x27;em&quot;. Kevin Courtney of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said the band had &quot;traded in their fried out old transit van in a hid to get a seat on the bright, shiny Britpop bus, and there&#x27;s no longer a faint whiff of Crust wafting in the air around them&quot;. In his collection &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin considered it a &quot;solid album containing some memorable songs&quot;, though it &quot;fell short of the greatness that many had expected&quot;.

&quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; charted at number seven in the UK, being certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in November 1996. By March 1997, the album had sold 400,000 copies in the UK. All of its singles charted highly in the UK: &quot;In a Room&quot; at number 12, &quot;Good Enough&quot; at number four, &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking of Me&quot; at number 11 and &quot;Found You&quot; at number 19. &quot;Good Enough&quot; was certified silver by the BPI in 2015. &quot;Select&quot; ranked &quot;Free Peace Sweet&quot; at number five on their best albums of 1996, and &quot;Good Enough&quot; at number ten on their list of the best songs of the same year.

<text>Nature is a book-length essay written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, published by James Munroe and Company in 1836. In the essay Emerson put forth the foundation of transcendentalism, a belief system that espouses a non-traditional appreciation of nature. Transcendentalism suggests that the divine, or God, suffuses nature, and suggests that reality can be understood by studying nature. Emerson&#x27;s visit to the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris inspired a set of lectures he later delivered in Boston which were then published.

Within the essay, Emerson divides nature into four usages: Commodity, Beauty, Language, and Discipline. These distinctions define the ways by which humans use nature for their basic needs, their desire for delight, their communication with one another, and their understanding of the world. Emerson followed the success of &quot;Nature&quot; with a speech, &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, which together with his previous lectures laid the foundation for transcendentalism and his literary career.

==Synopsis==
In &quot;Nature&quot;, Emerson lays out and attempts to solve an abstract problem: that humans do not fully accept nature&#x27;s beauty. He writes that people are distracted by the demands of the world, whereas nature gives but humans fail to reciprocate. The essay consists of eight sections: Nature, Commodity, Beauty, Language, Discipline, Idealism, Spirit and Prospects. Each section adopts a different perspective on the relationship between humans and nature.

In the essay Emerson explains that to experience the wholeness with nature for which we are naturally suited, we must be separate from the flaws and distractions imposed on us by society. Emerson believed that solitude is the single mechanism through which we can be fully engaged in the world of nature, writing &quot;To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.&quot;

When a person experiences true solitude, in nature, it &quot;take[s] him away&quot;. Society, he says, destroys wholeness, whereas &quot;Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other&#x27;s hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.&quot;

Emerson defines a spiritual relationship. In nature a person finds its spirit and accepts it as the Universal Being. He writes: &quot;Nature is not fixed but fluid. Spirit alters, moulds, it. ... Know then that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect.&quot;

==Theme: spirituality==

Emerson uses spirituality as a major theme in the essay. Emerson believed in re-imagining the divine as something large and visible, which he referred to as nature; such an idea is known as transcendentalism, in which one perceives a new God and a new body, and becomes one with his or her surroundings. Emerson confidently exemplifies transcendentalism, stating, &quot;From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind&quot;, postulating that humans and wind are one. Emerson referred to nature as the &quot;Universal Being&quot;; he believed that there was a spiritual sense of the natural world around him. Depicting this sense of &quot;Universal Being&quot;, Emerson states, &quot;The aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship&quot;.

According to Emerson, there were three spiritual problems addressed about nature for humans to solve: &quot;What is matter? Whence is it? And Whereto?&quot; What is matter? Matter is a phenomenon, not a substance; rather, nature is something that is experienced by humans, and grows with humans&#x27; emotions. Whence is it and Whereto? Such questions can be answered with a single answer, nature&#x27;s spirit is expressed through humans, &quot;Therefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up nature around us, but puts it forth through us&quot;, states Emerson. Emerson clearly depicts that everything must be spiritual and moral, in which there should be goodness between nature and humans.

==Influence==
&quot;Nature&quot; was controversial to some. One review published in January 1837 criticized the philosophies in &quot;Nature&quot; and disparagingly referred to the beliefs as &quot;Transcendentalist&quot;, coining the term by which the group would become known.

Henry David Thoreau had read &quot;Nature&quot; as a senior at Harvard College and took it to heart. It eventually became an essential influence for Thoreau&#x27;s later writings, including his seminal &quot;Walden&quot;. In fact, Thoreau wrote &quot;Walden&quot; after living in a cabin on land that Emerson owned. Their longstanding acquaintance offered Thoreau great encouragement in pursuing his desire to be a published author.

Emerson&#x27;s views in &quot;Nature&quot; were also an influence on Charles Stearns Wheeler building a shanty at Flint&#x27;s Pond in 1836. Considered the first Transcendentalist outdoor living experiment, Wheeler used his shanty during his summer vacations from Harvard from 1836 to 1842. Thoreau stayed at Wheeler&#x27;s shanty for six weeks during the summer of 1837, and got the idea that he wanted to build his own cabin (later realized at Walden in 1845). The exact location of the Wheeler shanty site was discovered by Jeff Craig in 2018, after a five-year search effort.

She was on the April 1976 cover of &quot;Playboy&quot;, photographed by Suze Randall. She also appeared in Playboy&#x27;s classic August 1976 Helmut Newton pictorial &quot;200 Motels, or How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot;, from which 11 original prints were sold at auctions of the &quot;Playboy&quot; archives by Butterfields in 2002 for $21,075, and three by Christie&#x27;s in December 2003 for $26,290.

Subsequently, she moved to mainstream film and television. Her most prominent film roles included playing A.L., a camp counselor, alongside Bill Murray, in the comedy &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979) and Jackie Chan&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; (1980). She appeared in a number of television pilots and individual episodes of various television series through the early 1980s. She returned to acting in 2012, appearing in a number of direct-to-video productions.

<text>Pannotia (from Greek: &quot;&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;south&quot;; meaning &quot;all southern land&quot;), also known as the Vendian supercontinent, Greater Gondwana, and the Pan-African supercontinent, was a relatively short-lived Neoproterozoic supercontinent that formed at the end of the Precambrian during the Pan-African orogeny (650–500 Ma), during the Cryogenian period and broke apart 560 Ma with the opening of the Iapetus Ocean, in the late Ediacaran and early Cambrian.
Pannotia formed when Laurentia was located adjacent to the two major South American cratons, Amazonia and Río de la Plata. The opening of the Iapetus Ocean separated Laurentia from Baltica, Amazonia, and Río de la Plata. A 2022 paper argues that Pannotia never fully existed, reinterpreting the geochronological evidence: &quot;the supposed landmass had begun to break up well before it was fully assembled&quot;. However, the assembly of the next supercontinent Pangaea is well established. 

==Origin of concept==
J. D. A. Piper was probably the first to propose a Proterozoic supercontinent preceding Pangaea, today known as Rodinia. At that time he simply referred to it as &quot;the Proterozoic super-continent&quot;, but much later he named this &quot;symmetrical crescent-shaped analogue of Pangaea&quot; &#x27;Palaeopangaea&#x27; and in 2000 he still insisted that there is neither a need nor any evidences for Rodinia or its daughter supercontinent Pannotia or a series of other proposed supercontinents since Archaean times.

The existence of a late Proterozoic supercontinent, much different from Pangaea, was first proposed by based on paleomagnetic data, and the break-up of this supercontinent around 625–550 Ma was documented by . The reconstruction of Bond et al. is virtually identical to that of and others.

Another term for the supercontinent that is thought to have existed at the end of Neoproterozoic time is &quot;Greater Gondwanaland&quot;, suggested by . This term recognizes that the supercontinent of Gondwana, which formed at the end of the Neoproterozoic, was once part of the much larger Neoproterozoic supercontinent.

Pannotia was named by , based on the term &quot;Pannotios&quot; originally proposed by for &quot;the cycle of tectonic activity common to the Gondwana continents that resulted in the formation of the supercontinent.&quot; proposed renaming the older Proterozoic supercontinent (now known as Rodinia) &quot;Kanatia&quot;, the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word from which the name Canada is derived, while keeping the name Rodinia for the latter Neoproterozoic supercontinent (now known as Pannotia). Powell, however, objected to this renaming and instead proposed Stump&#x27;s term for the latter supercontinent.

==Formation==

The formation of Pannotia began during the Pan-African orogeny when the Congo Craton was lodged between the northern and southern halves of the previous supercontinent Rodinia some 750 Ma. The peak in this mountain building event was around 640–610 Ma, but these continental collisions may have continued into the early Cambrian some 530 Ma. The formation of Pannotia was the result of Rodinia turning itself inside out.

When Pannotia had formed, Africa was located at the centre surrounded by the rest of Gondwana: South America, Arabia, Madagascar, India, Antarctica, and Australia. Laurentia, which &#x27;escaped&#x27; out of Rodinia, Baltica, and Siberia kept the relative positions they had in Rodinia. The Cathaysian and Cimmerian terranes (continental blocks of southern Asia) were located along the northern margins of east Gondwana. The Avalonian-Cadomian terranes (later to become central Europe, Britain, the North American east coast, and Yucatán) were located along the active northern margins of western Gondwana. This orogeny probably extended north into the Uralian margin of Baltica.

Pannotia formed by subduction of exterior oceans (a mechanism called extroversion) over a geoid low, whereas Pangaea formed by subduction of interior oceans (introversion) over a geoid high perhaps caused by superplumes and slab avalanche events.
The oceanic crust subducted by Pannotia formed within the Mirovia superocean that surrounded Rodinia before its 830–750 Ma break-up and were accreted during the late Proterozoic orogenies that resulted from the assembly of Pannotia.

One of the major of these orogenies was the collision between eastern and western Gondwana or the East African Orogeny. The Trans-Saharan Belt in West Africa is the result of the collision between the East Saharan Shield and the West African Craton when 1200–710 Ma volcanic and arc-related rocks were accreted to the margin of this craton.
Between 600 and 500 Ma, two Brazilian interior orogens were highly deformed and metamorphosed between a series of colliding cratons: Amazonia, West Africa-São Luís, and São Francisco-Congo-Kasai. The material that accreted included, 950–850 Ma, mafic meta-igneous complexes and younger arc-related rocks.

==Break-up==

The break-up of Pannotia was accompanied by sea level rise, dramatic changes in climate and ocean water chemistry, and rapid metazoan diversification. found Neoproterozoic passive margin sequences worldwide—the first indication of a Late Neoproterozoic supercontinent but also the traces of its demise.

The Iapetus Ocean started to open while Pannotia was being assembled, 200 Ma after the break-up of Rodinia. This opening of the Iapetus and other Cambrian seas coincided with the first steps in the evolution of soft-bodied metazoans, and also made a myriad of habitats available for them; this led to the so-called Cambrian explosion, the rapid evolution of skeletalized metazoans.

Trilobites originated in the Neoproterozoic and began to diversify before the break-up of Pannotia 600–550 Ma, as evidenced by their ubiquitous presence in the fossil record, and the lack of vicariance patterns in their lineage.

<text>Chez Panisse is a Berkeley, California, restaurant, known as one of the originators of California cuisine and the farm-to-table movement, opened and owned by Alice Waters. The restaurant emphasizes ingredients rather than technique and has developed a supply network of direct relationships with local farmers, ranchers and dairies.

The main restaurant, located downstairs, serves a set menu that changes daily and reflects the season&#x27;s produce. An upstairs cafe offers an a la carte menu at lower prices.

== History ==

The restaurateur, author, and food activist Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in 1971 with the film producer Paul Aratow, then a professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley. It is named for a character in Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s . They set up the restaurant and its menu on the principle that it was of primary importance to use food that was fresh and in season, grown locally, organically and sustainably. They deemphasized low prices and making available a variety of products unrelated to the season of the year, which is incompatible with growing food locally. Because the ingredients were procured locally in California, the food to some degree took on a very Californian character, hence helping create California cuisine.

Victoria Wise was the first chef. Waters and the restaurant began building up their network of local producers. Many of these local farmers, ranchers, and dairies continue to provide the restaurant with the majority of its ingredients today. This approach was extremely innovative. Later chefs de cuisine were Jeremiah Tower and Paul Bertolli and Jean-Pierre Moulle. The building was remodeled twice following fires in 1982 and 2013.

== Influences ==
The culinary influences for Chez Panisse were largely French, inspired by the 1920s cookbook of French &quot;cuisine bourgeoise&quot;, &quot;La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange&quot;. This book has been translated into English by Paul Aratow, who was also the first chef de cuisine at Chez Panisse. Waters, who had been an exchange student in France in the early 1960s, was influenced by French food-related values and customs, including buying local produce and frugality in avoiding waste. Other influences included vineyard owners Lulu and Lucien Peyraud and the writings of Richard Olney and Elizabeth David.

== Critical reception ==
In 2001, &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine named Chez Panisse the Best Restaurant in America. From 2002 to 2008 it was ranked by &quot;Restaurant&quot; magazine as one of the top 50 restaurants in the world and was ranked number 12 in 2003. Michelin awarded the restaurant a one-star rating in its guide to San Francisco Bay Area dining from 2006 through 2009, but the restaurant lost its star in 2010. In 2007, Alice Waters won Restaurant Magazine&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award, and was cited as one of the most influential figures in American cooking over the past 50 years.

== Culinary innovations ==
* Farm-to-table and California cuisine.
* &quot;California-style pizza&quot;, baked in an in-house pizza oven and topped with a variety of local ingredients, was created at the cafe in 1980.
* &quot;Goat Cheese Salad&quot;: first offered in the late 1970s, the salad contains rounds of chèvre marinated in olive oil and herbs, coated in bread crumbs, and baked, served with lightly dressed mesclun.
* &quot;In-house carbonated tap water&quot;: this filtered version of the East Bay Municipal Utility District offering first replaced conventional bottled water at the restaurant in summer 2006.

== Artwork and branding ==
Berkeley designer and printmaker David Lance Goines has illustrated many of the Chez Panisse posters and defined the visual brand in the 1970s and 1980s. The aesthetic for the brand was influenced by Ukiyo-e and the German Art Nouveau movement (German: Jugendstil).

Patricia Curtan has been the designer and artist of many of the menus and some of the cookbooks for Chez Panisse, which were created as linocut prints. Curtan published the book &quot;Menus for Chez Panisse&quot; (2011).

<doc id="826441" wikidata="Q848285" url="?curid=826441" title="Death Wish II">
<text>Death Wish II is a 1982 American vigilante action-thriller film directed and co-edited by Michael Winner. It is the first of four sequels to the 1974 film &quot;Death Wish&quot;. It is the second installment in the &quot;Death Wish&quot; film series. In the story, architect Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) moves to Los Angeles with his daughter (Robin Sherwood). After his daughter is murdered at the hands of several gang members, Kersey once again chooses to become a vigilante. Unlike the original, in which he hunts down every criminal he encounters, Kersey only pursues his family&#x27;s attackers. The sequel makes a complete breakaway from the Brian Garfield novels &quot;Death Wish&quot; and &quot;Death Sentence&quot;, redefining the Paul Kersey character. It was succeeded by &quot;Death Wish 3.&quot;

The sequel was produced by Cannon Films, which had purchased the rights to the &quot;Death Wish&quot; concept from Dino De Laurentiis. Cannon executive Menahem Golan planned to direct the film, but Winner returned on Bronson&#x27;s insistence. The soundtrack was composed by guitarist Jimmy Page. &quot;Death Wish II&quot; was released in the United States in February 1982 by Filmways Pictures. Like the original, Columbia Pictures handled the international release. Paramount Pictures, via Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media, handles the television rights. It earned $29 million during its domestic theatrical run.

==Plot==
Roughly eight years since the events of the first film, Paul Kersey has managed to recover from his shattered life and moved on and is now living in Los Angeles and working as a freelance architect. One of his clients is a close friend who owns a radio station for whom he is designing a new building and he is dating one of its reporters, Geri Nichols. They go to pick up Paul&#x27;s daughter, Carol, from the mental hospital. They spend the afternoon at a fairground, where Paul&#x27;s wallet is stolen by a gang, consisting of Nirvana, Punkcut, Stomper, Cutter, and Jiver.

The gang splits up when Paul chases them. He pursues Jiver, whom he corners in an alley. When Jiver says that he does not have the wallet, Paul lets him go. The gang find Paul&#x27;s home address in his wallet and break into his house. They restrain Rosario, Paul&#x27;s housekeeper, and begin taking turns raping her. When Paul arrives home with his daughter, he is beaten unconscious. Rosario tries to call the police, but Nirvana kills her with his crowbar. They kidnap Carol and take her to their hideout, where a gang member rapes her. Carol attempts to escape by running through a plate-glass window, falls onto an iron fence, and dies. Paul later refuses to help the police identify the muggers.

After Carol&#x27;s funeral, he takes his handgun to a low-rent inner-city hotel as a base of operations. The next evening, he sees Stomper and follows him into an abandoned building as a drug deal is about to be made. Paul fatally shoots one dealer and orders the others out before killing Stomper. The following night, he hears screams from a couple being assaulted in a parking garage by four muggers, which includes Jiver. Paul kills two rapists and wounds Jiver. Paul then follows Jiver&#x27;s blood trail into an abandoned warehouse and kills him.

The LAPD suspect that the murders are the work of a vigilante and ask the NYPD for guidance. NYPD Detective Frank Ochoa suspects it may be Paul again, and is sent to assist with the case. Ochoa understands that Paul, when caught, will reveal that he was released without being charged for killing the ten muggers in New York City. Ochoa enters Geri&#x27;s apartment and tells her about Paul&#x27;s previous vigilante killing spree in New York. After Paul returns to his house, Geri confronts him, but he denies everything.

Ochoa follows Paul, who is tailing the three remaining gang members. He follows them to an abandoned park, where an arms and drug deal is underway. A sniper scouts Paul and attempts to kill him. Ochoa warns Paul and fatally shoots the sniper. Ochoa is mortally wounded by Nirvana, and Paul wounds Punkcut and kills Cutter and another dealer. The arms dealer tries to get away, but Paul shoots and causes his car to drive off a cliff and explode. Nirvana escapes. Ochoa tells Paul to avenge him and dies. Paul escapes, and Punkcut dies from his injuries after giving information about Nirvana to the police.

Paul learns from one of Geri&#x27;s colleagues that the police are preparing a tactical unit to capture Nirvana. He obtains a police scanner and, by monitoring police radio traffic, finds out when and where the arrest is going to take place. He drives to the location to kill Nirvana, who, under the influence of PCP, slashes his arm and stabs officers while trying to escape. Tried and found criminally insane, he is sent to a mental institution.

Geri is writing a story about the case and capital punishment and takes Paul to the hospital to meet the doctor treating Nirvana. While there, Paul steals another doctor&#x27;s coat and identification card and uses it to enter the asylum and confront Nirvana. After repeatedly stabbing Paul with a shiv, Nirvana ends up plunging his arm into a high-voltage panel. Paul turns it on, fatally electrocuting him.

Donald Kay, an orderly, recognizes Paul from the newspaper coverage of Carol&#x27;s murder, and gives him three minutes to escape before he rings the alarm. Geri goes to Paul&#x27;s house and finds out that he made a fake doctor&#x27;s ID. Upon hearing a news report of Nirvana&#x27;s death on the radio, she realizes that Paul really is the vigilante that Ochoa claimed him to be. She takes off her engagement ring and leaves Paul, who arrives home moments later.

Months later, Paul attends a presentation of his building design for the radio station. The owner invites him to a launch party, but questions why Paul always seems to be unavailable in the evenings and never takes any phone calls. When Paul accepts the invitation he answers, &quot;What else would I be doing?&quot; Paul returns to the streets at night and continues his killing spree.

==Production==

===Development===
Brian Garfield, author of the original &quot;Death Wish&quot; novel, was so unhappy with the film version that he wrote his own sequel, &quot;Death Sentence&quot;. &quot;They&#x27;d made a hero out of him&quot;, said Garfield. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d shown that he&#x27;d become a very sick man.&quot; The idea to produce a sequel to &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974) originated with producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, owners of Cannon Films. They reportedly announced their plans to do so prior to actually securing the rights to the franchise. Dino De Laurentiis, co-producer of the original film, threatened them with a lawsuit unless they properly purchased the rights. He negotiated payments for himself, co-producers Hal Landers and Bobby Roberts, and original author Brian Garfield. The agreement included future payments for each prospective sequel.

In 1980, Cannon briefly hired Garfield to write an adaptation of his sequel to &quot;Death Wish&quot;, &quot;Death Sentence,&quot; in 1980. However, Golam and Globus did not want to use Garfield&#x27;s book, preferring an original story by David Engelbach, Golan, and Hal Landers. After they purchased the rights to the first film from De Laurentiis they purchased the rights to the characters of the novels from Garfield, meaning they could make a sequel without adapting the original novels. &quot;We think our story is a better film story&quot;, said Golan. &quot;You cannot call a film exploitative just because it touches on disturbing issues&quot;, said Globus. &quot;Both &quot;Death Wish&quot; films are a valid comment on American society... the theme of street violence getting out of control is sadly more of a fact of life than it was seven years ago.&quot; Garfield later approved a separate adaptation without the character of Paul Kersey directed by James Wan in 2007.

David Engelbach was then asked to write the screenplay. After he saw the final product, he was &quot;somewhat appalled&quot; how the film differed from his original script. His script didn&#x27;t include any rape scenes, but those were included by Michael Winner to &quot;get his rocks off&quot;. Engelbach argued that &quot;serious issues - namely, the deteriorating state of our criminal justice system. The actions of the Bronson character are dictated by the inability of the police to prevent crime, the preoccupation of the courts with technical rather than real justice, and the cancerous climate of fear in which we find ourselves today. Paul Kersey is no hero. In his pursuit of vengeance he loses the only emotional relationship of his life and by story&#x27;s end has become as much a victim of crime as the thugs he leaves dead in his wake&quot;.

===Casting===

Bronson was offered $1.5 million to reprise the role. Jill Ireland was cast in the film because Bronson, her husband, insisted on it. She serves as both the love interest to Paul and the voice of opposition to the death penalty. She had been offered a role in the film&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974), but Charles Bronson refused because he didn&#x27;t want his wife humiliated and messed around with by the actors who played muggers. After she was hired for this film, Bronson wanted her character not to get raped or killed by the villains of the film. Cannon initially asked Golan to direct, but Bronson insisted on recruiting Michael Winner, the director of the original.

Winner had suffered a downturn in his career since the mid-1970s, with no box-office hit since &quot;Death Wish&quot;. He agreed to return to the franchise and took the initiative in revising Engelbach&#x27;s script. Winner recalled that De Laurentiis was having second thoughts about letting someone else produce the sequel and offered to hire him to do the film for his own production company. Winner refused, and De Laurentiis did not renege on his deal with Cannon. The producer, however, started work on a &quot;clone&quot; of the film. The final result was &quot;Fighting Back&quot; (1982).

Winner said the sequel was pertinent because &quot;mugging is now a bigger issue in America. It&#x27;s spread to towns where it was not a problem before. In Beverly Hills, instead of talking about other people&#x27;s failed movies – thank God, something has stopped them at last – they talk about their muggings.&quot; The film introduced significant changes for the character of Paul. One involved his &quot;modus operandi&quot; as a vigilante. In the original film, Paul would shoot and kill every criminal in his vicinity. In the sequel, he is after five specific criminals who are responsible for the death of his daughter. His single-minded pursuit extends to ignoring other potential targets. He is seen to ignore most thieves, drug dealers, and one violent pimp.

Another change involves his abilities. In the first film, his activities as a vigilante rely on his use of weapons. In the sequel, he is able to beat up men who are considerably younger than himself. While casting the actors for the roles of the villains, Winner gave the actors playing the thugs a lot of creative leeway. They bought their own costumes, designed their own makeup and tested them out on passers-by to see how intimidating they&#x27;d look. Laurence Fishburne bought a pair of magician&#x27;s gloves and waved his knife like a wand, while Kevyn Major Howard waxed his eyebrows and shaved the front of his head to make himself look like a snake. He even developed mannerisms like his insane laugh, slapping his head and twirling a baton from seeing a live drummer in a punk band.

===Filming===

Among the final revisions of the script was a change in location. The original script set the action in San Francisco, but the revision moved the setting to Los Angeles. Winner said the film was &quot;the same, but different&quot;, from the original. &quot;That&#x27;s what sequels are – &quot;Rocky II&quot;, &quot;Rocky III&quot; – you don&#x27;t see Sylvester Stallone move to the Congo and become a nurse. Here the look of LA is what&#x27;s different. Besides – rape doesn&#x27;t date!&quot;

Principal photography began on May 4, 1981, in Downtown Los Angeles and concluded on July 1, 1981, in San Pedro. Filming often lasted twelve hours a day in order to complete it before a Screen Actors Guild strike. The film was shot on location and depicted actual &quot;sleazy&quot; areas of the city. Twenty off-duty men of the LAPD were hired to protect the film cast and crew from potential trouble. A scene involving the abandoned and crumpling Hollywood Hotel was shot in an abandoned hotel months before it was demolished.

Several film extras were locals hired to play a bit part, or happened to be passing by during a shooting. Among them were drug addicts, a drag queen, Hare Krishnas, and bikers. All were included by the director in an attempt to get an authentic feel of the streets of Los Angeles. Winner tried to keep the mood on the set lighthearted. &quot;Just because a film is terrifying, that doesn&#x27;t mean the people making it have to be grim&quot;, he said. All of the filming happened in Los Angeles, California. Places like San Pedro, Ladera Heights and Hollywood were included.

Silvana Gallardo said the rape scene was &quot;grueling&quot; and took about six days to film. To prepare for the role, she talked to an actual rape victim.

==Music==
Isaac Hayes was recommended by the producers of the film to compose the score. Michael Winner chose former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who was Winner&#x27;s neighbor at the time. The opening credits bear Page&#x27;s signature guitar tone, along with the heavy reverb-laden drum sound that he used with Led Zeppelin. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released in February 1982. Portions of the score were sampled by Twiztid in the song &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; from their album &quot;Heartbroken &amp; Homicidal&quot;.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Cannon Films was able to sell distribution rights to several interested buyers. Theatrical rights in the United States and Canada were purchased by Filmways. The company had recently acquired American International Pictures, known for its exploitation films, and the film fit in with their library of genre films. Columbia Pictures purchased the international distribution rights. Paramount Pictures purchased the television broadcast rights for the domestic market. The film was originally intended for release around the Christmas of 1981. Filmways decided to postpone release until February 1982 to face a weaker competition for an audience. The film became the top-grossing film of its opening week.

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS and then on DVD. It was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in the U.S. in May 2022 by Vinegar Syndrome.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $29 million in United States theaters, a rare box-office hit for the ailing Filmways. The company still ended 1982 with losses of $52.7 million. It was subsequently purchased by Orion Pictures. Another account says it made $10 million in rentals.

It made a $2 million profit for Cannon Films and made an extra $29 million worldwide.

It has since earned further money at home and abroad through release for the video market. A poll for HBO noted &quot;Death Wish II&quot; was in higher demand by paying viewers than &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981).

===Critical response===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it was &quot;even more foolish, more tacky, and more self-righteously inhumane than the 1974 melodrama off which it has been spun&quot; and &quot;so lethargic that it fails even to provoke outrage.&quot; He particularly criticized the way the film essentially repeats the plot of the original, the contrived incompetence of the police characters, and Jill Ireland&#x27;s unconvincing performance.

Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, noting that he reserves this rating solely for those very few films that are both &quot;artistically inept and morally repugnant.&quot; Citing the lethargic tone of the acting and directing, the lack of plot, the lifeless dialogue, and the weak action sequences, he concluded, &quot;while the first film convinced me of Bronson&#x27;s need for vengeance, this one is just a series of dumb killings.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;every bit as revolting as... the original&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 3.58/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 11 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.

The movie was nominated for a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture. The film was nominated for a Razzie Awards for Worst Musical Score.

<text>David Stephen Rappaport (23 November 1951 – 2 May 1990) was an English actor with achondroplasia (a genetic disorder where the primary feature is dwarfism). He appeared in the films &quot;Time Bandits&quot; and &quot;The Bride&quot;, and television series &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;The Wizard&quot; and &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;. He was 3&#x27; 11&quot; (1.19 m) in height.

==Early life==
Rappaport was born to Jewish taxi driver Mark and his wife Diana, née Schneiderman in London. He was born with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. As a child, he developed talents in playing the accordion and drums, the latter of which he played professionally during his life. Rappaport studied psychology at the University of Bristol from 1970, graduating with a degree while developing his skills as a semi-professional drummer, and acting skills at the college dramatical society.

After six months in the United States, he returned to the United Kingdom to marry his college girlfriend, Jane. They had a son Joe, and Rappaport tried to settle down to family life as a teacher. But as his marriage broke down and he decided to follow a career as an actor, he became a resident of the squatter &quot;nation&quot; of Frestonia, acting as Foreign Minister under the name David Rappaport-Bramley – all inhabitants adopted the surname &#x27;Bramley&#x27;, so that if the Greater London Council were to succeed in an eviction, they would have to rehouse them as one family.

==Career==
David Rappaport first came to public notice in children&#x27;s television, appearing alongside Sylvester McCoy as an O-Man in the 1979 BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;Jigsaw&quot;. Rappaport and McCoy had previously appeared together in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; at the Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool (founded by Ken Campbell and Chris Langham in 1976). The two men also appeared in the anarchic &quot;Ken Campbell Road Show&quot;. Rappaport was with the &quot;Road Show&quot; in 1979 when it featured in the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;. While McCoy appeared as an escapologist, Campbell introduced Rappaport to the audience as: &quot;Not the smallest man in the world, but fucking close...&quot;. He appeared in some season one sketches of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

In the early 1980s Rappaport played the character of &quot;Shades&quot; on the anarchic Saturday morning kids TV shows &quot;Tiswas&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;. One of Rappaport&#x27;s most popular roles was as Randall, the leader of the gang of dwarves in the Terry Gilliam film &quot;Time Bandits&quot; in 1981. During the mid-80s, Rappaport played in the HTV production of &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (released as &quot;Robin Hood&quot; in the US) with Jason Connery as Robin. The show was filmed in Bristol, where Rappaport had a home. During this time, he also made himself at home aboard Ki Longfellow-Stanshall and Vivian Stanshall&#x27;s ship moored in the Bristol docks, the Old Profanity Showboat, where he often appeared on stage. Rappaport appeared in 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Bride&quot; as a circus dwarf who befriends Frankenstein&#x27;s monster (played by Clancy Brown). In 1986, Rappaport appeared on the 1985–1987 NBC TV Series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in an episode called &quot;Gather Ye Acorns&quot; (starring Mark Hamill of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fame). From 1986 to 1987, Rappaport played the lead role of Simon McKay in the CBS television series &quot;The Wizard&quot;. Rappaport also made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;The Goodies&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;.

In &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, Rappaport played crack trial lawyer Hamilton Schuyler in two episodes. Both episodes were significant roles, opposing Jimmy Smits. The second of these, &quot;The Mouse that Roared&quot;, was filmed only six months prior to his death. Though the Schuyler character was frequently described as &quot;from Texas,&quot; Rappaport made no attempt to hide his British accent, which was never explained within the show.

Rappaport was the voice of Dr. Blight&#x27;s computer, MAL, on &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;; he was replaced by Tim Curry after his first four appearances due to his death four months before the series aired. He also played Mr. Belvedere&#x27;s cousin on an episode of &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; entitled &quot;Duel&quot; (Season 5 Episode 6).

==Final years, death and legacy==
Rappaport struggled with depression later in his life. Just before his death, he had been cast and begun filming for the role of Kivas Fajo in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Most Toys&quot;. During filming, Rappaport attempted suicide, and the scenes he had completed were later discarded when actor Saul Rubinek was hurriedly brought in by producers to replace him and complete the episode. The scenes of Rappaport as Kivas Fajo were included on the Season 3 Blu-ray Disc release of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

Rappaport died by suicide on 2 May 1990. He shot himself in the chest in Laurel Canyon Park in the San Fernando Valley in California.

Two of the creators of the US television series &quot;The Wizard&quot;, Michael Berk and Douglas Schwartz, went on to produce the lifeguard drama &quot;Baywatch&quot;. In this show&#x27;s fifth season is an episode entitled &quot;Short Sighted&quot; which originally aired on 31 October 1994. Part of this episode concerns junior lifeguard Carter McKay (Nicholas Banko), whose father Simon McKay (Ed Gale) is a namesake tribute to Rappaport&#x27;s character on &quot;The Wizard&quot;.

<text>Balzan () is a municipality in the Central Region of Malta, one of the so-called three villages, together with Attard and Lija. The village originally consisted of a group of small dwellings and farms but eventually grew, becoming a parish in the 17th century. As of 2022, the town registered a population of 4,821 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
In Malta, many village names are identical to certain family names, as in Attard and Lija. It is believed by some, therefore, that the village inherited its name from a family whose family name was &quot;Balzan&quot;.

Balsan (Balzan) literally means &quot;tax collector&quot; or &quot;contributions collector&quot;. The tax collector must have been from the same parish, at the time forming part of Birkirkara.

==Heritage and culture==
The church houses various works of art by famous Maltese painters such as Giuseppe Calleja, Chev. Emvin Cremona and Paul Camilleri Cauchi. The statue used in the village feast celebrated on the 2nd week of July is carved in wood by Salvatore Dimech (is-sartx) and shows Our Lady and Gabriel the Archangel. The parish also celebrates the feast of St. Valentine.

As with Attard and Lija, Balzan is a sought-after location and popular with the middle and upper middle classes. The population has increased due to large-scale development taking place, largely in the form of apartment blocks replacing villas and their gardens. However, this is mainly occurring on the outskirts of the village, and not the historic centre. The majority of Balzan is an Urban Conservation Area.

The Malta railway formerly spanned through Triq Ferrovija L-Qadima. A platform that served the village and the Palace was located close to Vjal De Paule. Ficus trees adorned the ends of the platform. One of them is still standing and is now itself a landmark. A section of rail that was used to support the tree is encased in the tree.

== Architecture ==

=== Churches ===
*Annunciation Church, Balzan: This church stands in the village core of Balzan and dates to the 17th century. It was erected in 1655; however, it was soon felt that there was not enough space for the growing population of the village. The first stone for the new church was laid in 1669, and the new structure blessed in 1695. The architect is not known, but the design can be attributed to the Tuscan style for its exterior with a Doric interior and a dome influenced by Baroque, which had just been introduced in Malta during those times. The entrance to the church features a stone statue of Our Lady in a niche on top of which there is a stained-glass rose window in the form of a circle. The belfry was built in 1708 with the dome finished a year before.
*Parish Church of the Annunciation (Parish Church). This parish church, built in the 17th century, also stands in the village core. The blessing and laying of the foundation stone took place on 26 December 1669. Fr. Domenico Ellul was the parish priest at the time. The local community had been asking for a bigger church to accommodate the population of the village which continued to increase year on year. After many requests including an official petition presented by Fr Ellul to Vicar General Mgr Cauchi, their prayers were answered. Mgr Balaguer registered his acceptance of their wishes officially on 11 July 1663. The shape of the church follows the rules set forth by the church in the Council of Trent dictating the requirement to have the building in the plan of a cross. The nave is designed to lead to the main altar which faces East, a North and South Transep and a specially allocated space for the Choir. Parts of the church and its façade were restored in September 2020 as part of funds available through the European Regional Development Fund.
*Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary: The church we see today was built in 1846 at the insistence of Rev Salvu Sammut Pullicino who wanted to build a church in the style that was popular at the time. The Ionic Facade is complemented with a Composite style interior. In World War II the church was used as a temporary home for refugees fleeing the Cottonera area. Later, it also served as a teaching space for the University of Malta Law students. Post war it was utilised as a store for statues and other street decorations used in the Village feasts. After its restoration it served as a chapel dedicated to adoration. In front of the church we find a statue of Our Lady which dates back to the early 19th century.
*Church of St Roque Situated on &quot;Three Churches Street&quot;, this chapel was built in 1593 with the outbreak of the Plague during that same year. Victims of this devastating disease were buried in the church. The main painting in the chapel shows St. Roque, St. Paul and St. Sebastian, all three protector saints against the deadly disease.
* Chapel of the Good Shepherd. This small chapel within the grounds of the Good Shepherd convent was dedicated to St Joseph. It was designed by architect Vincenzo Busuttil and its stone construction left in the able hands of Mason Piju Ebejer. It was inaugurated on 4 April 1870. A much larger church was built during the period of 1898–1901. This new building was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Archbishop Monsigneur Peter Pace blessed the chapel on 7 February 1901.

===The reverence to St Roque===
A common occurrence in many streets, buildings and historical sites around Malta is the reverence to Saint Roque. The belief is that Saint Roque is the protector saint against the plague and honouring him would protect the inhabitants against the Plague and any other form of contagious disease prevalent at the time. In Balzan there is a church, a street as well as a statue dedicated to &quot;Santu Rokku&quot; (Saint Roque)&quot;.&quot; The statue is strategically placed at the corner of the street bearing the same name in order to oversee and protect the people living in the village.

=== Villas ===
Melita Gardens were part of the San Anton Palace, built by the Order of the Knights of St. John in the early 17th century and are now privately owned. Originally serving as the mistresses&#x27; quarters and were connected to the palace by means of a tunnel that is now inaccessible. In the late 19th century, it was restored in the Art Noveau architectural style as a typical home of the Maltese aristocracy of the time. With its extensive gardens it remains a relic of the villas that once adorned most of Balzan. During the war, it served as a hotel and more recently as an entertainment venue.

They were initially given a house in Lija by the Marquis Testaferrata to set up a boarding school for girls coming from Malta and Sicily. Today this building serves as the site for the Local Council, Social Services and Post Office within the village. They also offered classes for orphans and women who wanted to lead more meaningful lives. The convent in Balzan was built with the help of many benefactors in 1868. The work of the convent continues to be that of helping and offering women and their children shelter from domestic violence, helping single mothers and now also helping male refugess and their families who end up in Malta.
* The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary Convent was built in 1926. It housed a convent, a chapel and a school.

Since 2008, Stella Maris School has been a feeder school for St Aloysius College where students move to gain their secondary education.

<doc id="826461" wikidata="Q2629523" url="?curid=826461" title="Maria Petrova (rhythmic gymnast)">
<text>Maria Dimitrova Petrova (; born 13 November 1975) is a Bulgarian former rhythmic gymnast who is now a rhythmic gymnastics judge and official. She is a triple World all-around champion (1993, 1994, 1995) and a triple European all-around champion (1992, 1993, 1994).

==Career==
Born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, Petrova began her training at the age of five at local club Trakia Plovdiv Club, coached by Natalia Moravenova. By 1991, she was coached by Neshka Robeva at the Levski Sofia Club. In her first World Championship appearance, Petrova placed second in the team competition after a hoop drop.

Petrova was one of the favorites to win gold but found herself finishing in fifth in the all-around finals at the Barcelona Olympics after a penalty of .20 was imposed due to the zipper on the back of her leotard that had broken during her hoop exercise. A few months later, at the World Championships, Petrova took second place behind Russia&#x27;s Oxana Kostina and ahead of Belarusian Larissa Lukyanenko.

In 1993, Petrova performed with her Panovaesque ball to an Indian melody. She also competed in a ribbon exercise, and a small-toss filled clubs routine to Suzanne Vega&#x27;s &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;. Her final performance to Carmina Burana caused a great crowd ovation. She went on to win the all-around World title, as well as three more gold medals (ball, hoop, ribbon) and a bronze medal (clubs).

She went on to win one more European title and two more world titles (shared in 1995 with Yekaterina Serebrianskaya), tying her with countrywoman Maria Gigova for the most wins in the latter category.

Competing in her second Olympics, Petrova was one of the front runner to win the gold at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, however a series of mistakes left her finishing in 5th place in the All-around Finals behind Russia&#x27;s Amina Zaripova.

Although she had tried to retire several times after her first World title, Petrova continued competing as a favor to the Bulgarian national team, which was in a rebuilding phase after the Eastern European Communist collapse.

Petrova previously shared the world record for most individual world all-around rhythmic gymnastics titles with Maria Gigova, Evgenia Kanaeva and Yana Kudryavtseva, until that record was broken by Dina Averina in 2021. Petrova&#x27;s three titles were earned in 1993, 1994, and 1995 (shared).

She is currently a judge in rhythmic gymnastics and served as the Execution Supervisor at the 2024 Paris Olympics. In 2021, she was elected second vice president of the International Gymnastics Federation technical committee for rhythmic gymnastics, and she was re-elected in 2024.

== Personal life ==
In 1998, Petrova married Bulgarian footballer Borislav Mihaylov.

== Achievements ==

* Petrova won 3 world titles in three consecutive years (1993, 1994, 1995 tied with Ekaterina Serebrianskaya) equaled only by fellow countrywoman Maria Gigova (1969, 1971 tied with Galima Shugurova, 1973) and Russian gymnasts Evgenia Kanaeva (2009, 2010, 2011) and Yana Kudryavtseva (2013, 2014, 2015).

<doc id="826464" wikidata="Q7834252" url="?curid=826464" title="Transhistoricity">
<text>Transhistoricity is the quality of holding throughout human history, not merely within the frame of reference of a particular form of society at a particular stage of historical development. An entity or concept that has transhistoricity is said to be transhistorical.

Certain theories of history (e.g. that of Hegel), treat human history as divided into distinct epochs with their own internal logics—historical materialism is the most famous case of such a theory. States of affairs which hold within one epoch may be completely absent, or carry opposite implications in another, according to these theories.

== In the abstract ==
Transhistoricity may be seen as the necessary antithesis to the idea that meanings are bounded by their historical context. It is the temporal equivalent of the spatial concept of universality.

== In sociopolitical theory ==
Questions of what might and might not be transhistorical phenomena are typically the concern of historians and sociologists identifying with the historicist traditions of Hegelian or Marxian thought, but matter additionally in the debates around Kuhn&#x27;s notion of paradigm shift.

Fredric Jameson, a Marxist literary theorist, asserted that theory must &quot;Always historicize!&quot;, going on to observe that this order was itself a &quot;transhistorical imperative&quot;.

Others look for transhistorical continuities to inform what&#x27;s basic to the human condition. For example, D. K. Simonton, finds some regularities in the types of ideas that gain ascendancy following certain types of historical events, in a data series spanning 2,500 years.

In more recent years, research in the vicinity of evolutionary psychology has proceeded on the basis that some observed transcultural regularities in human behaviour are also transhistoric, accounted for by their being fixed in the genetic legacy common to all &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

== In aesthetics ==
Part of the debate over the distinction between high art and folk art (or lesser disciplines) hinges on the question of whether art can (and if so, if it should) aspire to transcend the particular frame of reference within which it was produced. This frame may be taken to be historically delimited.

<text>Nard (, also narde or nardshir; from &quot;nēw-ardaxšīr&quot;) is an historical Persian tables game for two players that is sometimes considered ancestral to backgammon. It is still played today, albeit in a different form. As in other tables games, the playing pieces are moved around a board according to rolls of dice. It uses a standard tables board, but has a different opening layout and rules of play from that of backgammon.

== History ==
The game has been historically popular in Persia, Muslim countries, and among Babylonian Jews. A common legend associates the game with the founder of the Sassanian Dynasty, Ardashir. Indeed, the Persian name is a shortening of the older name , from Middle Persian &quot;nēw-ardaxšīr&quot; &quot;brave Ardashir&quot;. The oldest known reference to the game is thought to be a passage in the Talmud, although some claim it refers to the Greek game Kubeia. Another early reference is to be found in the Middle Persian romance &quot;Chatrang-namak&quot; (written between the 7th and 9th centuries) which attributes the invention of the game to Bozorgmehr. The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (written around the year 1000) also attributes the invention to Bozorgmehr. Parlett refers to Nard as &quot;proto-Backgammon&quot;.

By the 17th century the game was played in Georgia under the name of &quot;nardi&quot;, and by the 19th century it was being played by the Kalmyks, who called it &quot;narr&quot;. During most part of the 20th century both Georgia and Kalmykia were parts of USSR, so now the game is played in Russia and other ex-USSR countries under the name of Nardy (нарды).

== Rules ==
=== Common rules ===

The following rules apply to all the variants below:

* Players: the game is played by two players
* Equipment: Tables board of 24 points or spaces; 2 dice; 30 pieces or men of 2 different designs (15 per player)
* First play: both players throw a die to decide who plays first; the one with the higher die leads off
* Game turns: players takes turns at rolling both dice simultaneously
* Movement: players must always move their pieces forwards; which direction that is depends on the variant
* Moves: 
** Two men may be moved forward on each turn, the first by the score on one die and the second by the score of the other die
** Alternatively one man may be moved forward based on the total dice score; but must rest on an intermediate point corresponding to the score on one of the dice
** Points or spaces may be open or closed. A man may only be moved to an open one, the definition of which depends on the variant
* Bearing off:
** Begins once all 15 pieces or men are in the final, or home, quadrant
** One man is removed from the point corresponding to the roll of each die i.e. if a man is on the 3rd point from the end, a 3 must be rolled to bear it off
** If there are no men on the point corresponding to a die roll, the player must make a legal move with a man further away
** If that is not possible, a man is borne off from the furthest point that is occupied.

=== Nardshir ===

The earliest description of the rules for Nard, known then as Nardshir, dates to a 6th century AD booklet by the Persian author, Bozorgmehr. These rules have been reconstructed as follows.

Players begin by setting up the board as shown. White is at the top and places on the home side, 3 men on the 6 and 8 points and 2 on the 3 and 7 points; on the opposing side he places 2 men on the Ace point and 3 on the 12 point. Black mirrors White&#x27;s layout. Players move in &quot;opposite directions&quot;; White moves clockwise and Black, anticlockwise.

In turn, each player throws the dice and moves men as described above. A man may not rest or move onto a closed point i.e. one occupied by two or more opposing men; however, a single enemy man may be hit and removed from the board. Men so removed, must be re-entered before any men already on the board are played. They are re-entered into the first quadrant (points 1 to 6). Players must move their men if they can; if unable to make a legal move with one of the dice, however, they forfeit that die roll. If unable to use either die, they forfeit both and miss a go.

Once all 15 men have reached the 4th, or home, quadrant, the player may begin to bear them off the board and the first to do so is the winner.

=== Todas Tablas ===

In Alfonso X&#x27;s 13th century book of games, &quot;El Libro de los Juegos&quot;, is a game called Todas Tablas, which many scholars equate to modern Backgammon although the description and opening layout are not the same. Some also equate it to Nard, thus assuming that Nard and Backgammon are the same game, a proposition challenged by Robet and others.

=== Nard ===
A modern version of Nard as played in the Near East is described by Botermans. Robet suggests that this version could be closer to the original game than Todas Tablas. The following is an overview of the rules:

The board comprises 24 &#x27;spaces&#x27; in four quadrants or tables. Each player stacks 15 men on the space at the top right in the opponent&#x27;s home table and rolls a die to decide who will start.

Players move their men in &quot;opposite&quot; directions. Rolling a doublet counts twice i.e. a double 3 means four pieces may move 3 spaces or one piece 12 spaces or any other combination of four 3s. The tablemen must always be moved to an open space (see below) and, in the event that one is moved by the total roll of the dice, the intermediate space must also be free. If a player cannot use either or both dice legally, the entire turn is forfeited.

A space is &#x27;closed&#x27; if there are exactly two opposing men on it; otherwise it is &#x27;open&#x27;, even if there are three or more enemy on it. A single opposing man may be captured by moving a man to the same space. The &#x27;captive&#x27; remains next to the rail on the outside of the board and its &#x27;captor&#x27; is placed on the inside. The captive may not be moved until the captor moves away and the space is closed to the player whose man was captured. In moving pieces, players may jump over closed spaces.

Bearing off is as described above. If a series of games is being played, the winner may score for every enemy man left on the board as follows: 

* 4th quadrant (inner table): 1 point
* 3rd quadrant (outer table): 2 points
* 2nd quadrant: 3 points
* 1st quadrant: 4 points.

=== Russian Nardy ===
Long Nardy, Nardy or Narde is the Russian variant of Nard. The starting layout is as in Nard above with all 15 pieces on the starting point or &#x27;head&#x27; at the players top right. However, this time, players move in the &quot;same direction&quot;.

Players takes turns to roll the dice and move their pieces as before. A piece may only be moved to an open point i.e. one that is not occupied by &quot;any&quot; opposing pieces. If both dice are used to move one piece, the intermediate point on which the piece rests must also be open. Doublets count twice. Both dice must be used if possible; if only one can be used, the higher one must be played. There is no hitting and a prime may not be built in front of all the opposing pieces; at least one must be ahead of the prime.

There are special rules for moving pieces off the head: only one piece may be moved off the head per turn, except in the first turn when two pieces may be moved off the head. It is compulsory to move two off the head on the first go if a double 3, double 4 or double 6 is rolled.

Bearing off is as normal and the first player to bear off all pieces wins and scores 1 point. If this is achieved before the opponent bears any pieces off, the game scores double.

<text>Frank Scott Hogg (July 26, 1904 – January 1, 1951) was a Canadian astronomer. Hogg was born in Preston, Ontario to Dr. James Scott Hogg and Ida Barberon. After earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto, Hogg received the second doctorate in astronomy awarded at Harvard University in 1929 where he pioneered in the study of spectrophotometry of stars and of spectra of comets. His supervisor there was Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin. During World War II, he developed a two-star sextant for air navigation. He was the head of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Toronto and director of the David Dunlap Observatory from 1946 until his death. During this time he pursued the observatory&#x27;s major research program to study the motions of faint stars in the line of sight. He was married to fellow astronomer Helen Sawyer Hogg from 1930 until his death from a heart attack in 1951. The crater Hogg on the moon is co-named for him and Arthur Robert Hogg.

<doc id="826477" wikidata="Q58612" url="?curid=826477" title="Yehuda Amichai">
<text>Yehuda Amichai (; born Ludwig Pfeuffer 3 May 1924 – 22 September 2000) was an Israeli poet and author, one of the first to write in colloquial Hebrew in modern times.

Amichai was awarded the 1957 Shlonsky Prize, the 1969 Brenner Prize, 1976 Bialik Prize, and 1982 Israel Prize. He also won international poetry prizes, and was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Biography==
Yehuda Amichai was born in Würzburg, Germany, to an Orthodox Jewish family, and was raised speaking both Hebrew and German. His German name was Ludwig Pfeuffer.

Amichai immigrated with his family at the age of eleven to Petah Tikva in Mandate Palestine in 1935, moving to Jerusalem in 1936. He attended Ma&#x27;aleh, a religious high school in Jerusalem. He was a member of the Palmach, the strike force of the Haganah, the defense force of the Jewish community in Mandate Palestine. As a young man he volunteered and fought in World War II as a soldier in the British Army, and in the Negev on the southern front in the 1947–1949 Palestine war.

After discharge from the British Army in 1946, Amichai was a student at David Yellin College of Education in Jerusalem, and became a teacher in Haifa. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Amichai studied the Torah and Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Encouraged by one of his professors at Hebrew University, he published his first book of poetry, &quot;Now and in Other Days&quot;, in 1955.

In 1956, Amichai served in the Sinai War, and in 1973 he served in the Yom Kippur War. Amichai published his first novel, &quot;Not of This Time, Not of This Place&quot;, in 1963. It is about a young Israeli who was born in Germany; after World War II, and the 1947–1949 Palestine war, he visits his hometown in Germany and recalls his childhood, trying to make sense of the world that created the Holocaust. His second novel, &quot;Mi Yitneni Malon&quot;, about an Israeli poet living in New York, was published in 1971 while Amichai was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a poet in residence at New York University in 1987. For many years he taught literature in an Israeli seminar for teachers, and at the Hebrew University to students from abroad.

Amichai was invited in 1994 by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to read from his poems at the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. &quot;God Has Pity on Kindergarten Children&quot; was one of the poems he read. This poem is inscribed on a wall in the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Tel Aviv. There are streets named for him in cities in Israel, and also one in Würzburg.

Amichai was married twice. He was first married to Tamar Horn, with whom he had one son, and then to Chana Sokolov; they had one son and one daughter. His two sons were Ron and David, and his daughter was Emmanuella.

Amichai died of cancer in 2000, at age 76.

== Poetry ==
Amichai&#x27;s poetry deals with issues of day-to-day life, and with philosophical issues of the meaning of life and death. Amichai’s approach consistently prioritizes the living person over the dead symbol, and the human experience over the mythical. His work is characterized by gentle irony and original, often surprising imagery. Like many secular Israeli poets, he struggles with religious faith. His poems are full of references to God and the religious experience. He was described as a philosopher-poet in search of a post-theological humanism.

Amichai has been credited with a &quot;rare ability for transforming the personal, even private, love situation, with all its joys and agonies, into everybody&#x27;s experience, making his own time and place general.&quot;

Some of his imagery was accused of being sacrilegious. In his poem &quot;And this is Your Glory&quot; (&quot;Vehi Tehilatekha&quot;), for example, God is sprawled under the globe like a mechanic under a car, futilely trying to repair it. In the poem &quot;Gods Change, Prayers Stay the Same&quot; (&quot;Elim Mithalfim, ha-Tfillot Nisharot la-Ad&quot;), God is a portrayed as a tour guide or magician.

Many of Amichai&#x27;s poems were set to music in Israel and in other countries. Among them:
the poem &quot;Memorial Day for the War Dead&quot; was set to music for solo voices, chorus and orchestra in Mohammed Fairouz&#x27;s Third Symphony.
Other poems were set by the composers Elizabeth Alexander (&quot;Even a fist was once an open palm and fingers&quot;), David Froom, Matthias Pintscher, Jan Dušek, Benjamin Wallfisch, Ayelet Rose Gottlieb, Maya Beiser, Elizabeth Swados, Daniel Asia and others.

== Language and poetic style ==
In an interview published in the &quot;American Poetry Review&quot;, Amichai spoke about his command of Hebrew:

I grew up in a very religious household ... So the prayers, the language of prayer itself became a kind of natural language for me ... I don&#x27;t try—like sometimes poets do—to &#x27;enrich&#x27; poetry by getting more cultural material or more ethnic material into it. It comes very naturally.

Robert Alter describes Amichai&#x27;s poetry as a &quot;play of sound&quot;. He &quot;builds a strong momentum that moves in free association from word to word, the sounds virtually generating the words that follow in the syntactic chain through phonetic kinship&quot;.

Amichai&#x27;s work was popular in English translation, but admirers of his poetry in the original Hebrew claim his innovative use of the language is lost in translation. Subtle layers of meaning achieved using an ancient word rather than its modern synonym to impart a biblical connotation cannot always be conveyed. In Amichai&#x27;s love poem &quot;In the Middle of This Century&quot;, for instance, the English translation reads: &quot;the linsey-woolsey of our being together&quot;. The Hebrew term, &quot;shaatnez&quot;, refers to the biblical taboo on interweaving linen and wool, which a Hebrew reader would grasp as an image of forbidden union.

== Literary work ==
Amichai traced his beginnings as a poetry lover to when he was stationed with the British army in Egypt. There he happened to find an anthology of modern British poetry, and the works of Dylan Thomas, T. S. Eliot, and W. H. Auden. That book inspired his first thoughts about becoming a writer.

Literary scholar Boaz Arpaly wrote about the influence of biography on Amichai&#x27;s poetry: &quot;Literary criticism made the determination long ago that despite the autobiographical character of Amichai&#x27;s poetry, the individual depicted in it is the typical Israeli everyman, and even in a wider sense, the individual as an individual of the twentieth century (a poetics that interweaves the private with the typically generic) ... Amichai routinely conflates biographical details from different times into one poetic framework, and exploits drafts and poetic ideas that were recorded in different periods, for a poem that would be written years later.&quot; &quot;Almost every poem by Amichai is a statement about the general human condition and Amichai, in a certain sense, is always a philosophical poet.&quot;

He changed his name to Yehuda Amichai (&quot;my people lives&quot;) around 1946. In her biography of Amichai, literary critic Nili Scharf Gold writes that the idea for the name change, as well as the name &quot;Amichai&quot;, came from his girlfriend, Ruth Herrmann, who later moved to the United States and married Eric Zielenziger. Contrary to Gold&#x27;s claim, Amichai said in an interview that it was his idea to choose the name Amichai: &quot;it was common at that time to change (foreign) names into Hebrew names ... &#x27;Amichai&#x27; was a right name, because it was Socialist, Zionist and optimistic.&quot;

Gold wrote that a childhood trauma in Germany affected Amichai&#x27;s later poetry. She claims in her book that Amichai had an argument with a childhood friend, Ruth Hanover, which led to her cycling home angrily. Ruth was caught in a traffic accident, as a result of which she had to have a leg amputated, and Gold claims that Amichai felt guilt and responsibility. Ruth later was murdered in the Holocaust. Amichai occasionally referred to her in his poems as &quot;Little Ruth&quot;.

In an interview Amichai said: &quot;Little Ruth is my Anne Frank&quot;. &quot;I found out that she (Little Ruth) was in the last transport in 1944. This knowledge goes with me all the time, not because of guilt.&quot; &quot;If there is any guilty feeling it&#x27;s like the guilt that soldiers feel when they survive the battle while their friends were killed.&quot;

Robert Alter wrote about Gold&#x27;s contention: &quot;Again and again Gold asks why Amichai did not represent his German childhood in his poetry, except fragmentarily and obliquely. The inconvenient fact that his major novel, &quot;Not of This time, Not of This Place&quot;, devotes elaborate attention to Würzburg (which is given the fictional name Weinburg) is not allowed to trouble Gold&#x27;s thesis of suppression, because the book is fiction, not poetry, and hence is thought somehow to belong to a different category in regard to the writer&#x27;s relation to his early years. But Gold&#x27;s notion of Amichai&#x27;s &#x27;poetics of camouflage&#x27; rests on an entirely unexamined assumptionthat it is the task of the poet to represent his life directly and in full ...&quot; However, contrary to Alter&#x27;s claims, Gold argued that Amichai only wrote extensively about Würzburg in his novel because it was not his primary genre and therefore would be read by fewer people. Moreover, &quot;Not of This Time, Not of This Place&quot; does not hide the fact that it is based on Amichai&#x27;s autobiography, including both his trip to his former hometown (and, explicitly, his search for closure about Little Ruth) and his affair with an American woman.

Amichai wrote many plays and radio plays, a book of short stories, and a second novel.

Boaz Arpaly wrote: &quot;Amichai did not hide in his poetry the fact that he was an immigrant and a son of immigrants, but he chose to tell the story of his childhood in his hometown, in his novel &quot;Not of This Time, Not of This Place&quot;, and like any other writer, he decided which material of his life will become material to his poetry...&quot;

:Did Amichai want to become a national poet? ... his poetry embodied a silent but piercing revolution against the social and political institutions that enslave the life and happiness of the individual for their need – He should bother so much to build for himself the mythology of a national poet? All the things that Gold thinks he was hiding were not in any contrast to the unique &quot;nationality&quot; embodied in his poetry. I did not find in Gold&#x27;s book an explanation to the concept &#x27;national poet&#x27; but in the first place, this concept appears in her book she is pointing to my article (1997) that says: &quot;of all the poets who began to at the time of Amichai, or in later years, since Alterman there was not a poet more popular than Amichai. In this he is unique. He is probably the only canonic poet read by so many, also by people that do not belong to the Literary Community. In this matter he has no rivals. From this aspect, at least, he may be considered a national poet, a title that does not suit him from any other point of view ...&quot; Gold&#x27;s use of that title is not clear and not responsible.

== Critical acclaim ==
Amichai&#x27;s poetry in English appeared in the first issue of &quot;Modern Poetry in Translation&quot;, edited by Daniel Weissbort and Ted Hughes in 1965. In 1966 he appeared at the Spoleto poetry festival with Ezra Pound, W.H. Auden, Pablo Neruda and others. In 1968, he appeared at the London Poetry Festival. His first book in English, &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1968), was translated by Assia Guttman (Hughes&#x27; lover and mother to his daughter Shura). Referring to him as &quot;the great Israeli poet&quot;, Jonathan Wilson wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he is, &quot;one of very few contemporary poets to have reached a broad cross-section without compromising his art. He was loved by his readers worldwide.&quot;

In the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Ted Hughes wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ve become more than ever convinced that Amichai is one of the biggest, most essential, most durable poetic voices of this past century – one of the most intimate, alive and human, wise, humorous, true, loving, inwardly free and resourceful, at home in every human situation. One of the real treasures.&quot;

In &quot;The American Poetry Review&quot;, May–June 2016, David Biespiel wrote: &quot;He translates the hardness of existence into new tenderness; tenderness into spiritual wonder that is meant to quiet outrage; and outrage into a mixture of worry and love and warmth ... He is one of the great joyful lamenters of all time, endlessly documenting his anguish, throbbing pains, mistaken dreams, shortages of faith, abundances of ecstatic loves, and humiliations. And, like everyone else, he wants everything both ways. In particular, he wants to be a lover and a loner, a guy in the street and an intellectual, believer and infidel, while insisting that all manifestations of war against the human spirit be mercilessly squashed.&quot;

Anthony Hecht said in 2000 that &quot;Open Closed Open&quot; &quot;is as deeply spiritual a poem as any I have read in modern times, not excluding Eliot&#x27;s Four Quartets, or anything to be found in the works of professional religionists. It is an incomparable triumph. Be immediately assured that this does not mean devoid of humor, or without a rich sense of comedy.&quot;. And: &quot;not only superb, but would, all by itself, have merited a Nobel Prize.&quot;

Author Nicole Krauss has said that she was affected by Amichai from a young age.

Amichai&#x27;s poetry has been translated into 40 languages.

== Awards and honours ==

* 1976 – Bialik Prize for literature (co-recipient with essayist Yeshurun Keshet)
* 1981 – Würzburg&#x27;s Prize for Culture (Germany)
* 1982 – Israel Prize for Hebrew poetry. The prize citation reads, in part: &quot;Through his synthesis of the poetic with the everyday, Yehuda Amichai effected a revolutionary change in both the subject matter and the language of poetry.&quot;
* 1986 – Agnon Prize
* 1994 – Malraux Prize: International Book Fair (France)
* 1994 – Literary Lion Award (New York)

Amichai received an Honor Citation from Assiut University, Egypt, and numerous honorary doctorates. He became an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1986), and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1991). His work is included in the &quot;100 Greatest Works of Modern Jewish Literature&quot; (2001), and in international anthologies &quot;Poems for the Millennium&quot; by J. Rothenberg and P. Joris, and &quot;100 Great Poems of the 20th Century&quot; by Mark Strand. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize several times, but never won. Tufts University English professor Jonathan Wilson wrote, &quot;He should have won the Nobel Prize in any of the last 20 years, but he knew that as far as the Scandinavian judges were concerned, and whatever his personal politics, which were indubitably on the dovish side, he came from the wrong side of the stockade.&quot;

== Amichai Archive ==
Amichai sold his archive for over $200,000 to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Yale University. The archive contains 1,500 letters received from the early 1960s to the early 1990s from dozens of Israeli writers, poets, intellectuals and politicians. Overseas correspondence includes letters from Ted Hughes, Arthur Miller, Erica Jong, Paul Celan, and many others. The archive also includes dozens of unpublished poems, stories and plays; 50 notebooks and notepads with 1,500 pages of notes, poems, thoughts and drafts from the 1950s onward; and the poet&#x27;s diaries, which he kept for 40 years. According to Moshe Mossek, former head of the Israel State Archive, these materials offer priceless data about Amichai&#x27;s life and work.

<text>Population viability analysis (PVA) is a species-specific method of risk assessment frequently used in conservation biology.
It is traditionally defined as the process that determines the probability that a population will go extinct within a given number of years.
More recently, PVA has been described as a marriage of ecology and statistics that brings together species characteristics and environmental variability to forecast population health and extinction risk. Each PVA is individually developed for a target population or species, and consequently, each PVA is unique. The larger goal in mind when conducting a PVA is to ensure that the population of a species is self-sustaining over the long term.

==Uses==
Population viability analysis (PVA) is used to estimate the likelihood of a population’s extinction and indicate the urgency of recovery efforts, and identify key life stages or processes that should be the focus of recovery efforts. PVA is also used to identify factors that drive population dynamics, compare proposed management options and assess existing recovery efforts. PVA is frequently used in endangered species management to develop a plan of action, rank the pros and cons of different management scenarios, and assess the potential impacts of habitat loss.

==History==

In the 1970s, Yellowstone National Park was the centre of a heated debate over different proposals to manage the park’s problem grizzly bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;). In 1978, Mark Shaffer proposed a model for the grizzlies that incorporated random variability, and calculated extinction probabilities and minimum viable population size. The first PVA is credited to Shaffer.

PVA gained popularity in the United States as federal agencies and ecologists required methods to evaluate the risk of extinction and possible outcomes of management decisions, particularly in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the National Forest Management Act of 1976.

In 1986, Gilpin and Soulé broadened the PVA definition to include the interactive forces that affect the viability of a population, including genetics.
The use of PVA increased dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s following advances in personal computers and software packages.

==Examples==
The endangered Fender&#x27;s blue butterfly (&quot;Icaricia icarioides&quot;) was recently assessed with a goal of providing additional information to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which was developing a recovery plan for the species. The PVA concluded that the species was more at risk of extinction than previously thought and identified key sites where recovery efforts should be focused. The PVA also indicated that because the butterfly populations fluctuate widely from year to year, to prevent the populations from going extinct the minimum annual population growth rate must be kept much higher than at levels typically considered acceptable for other species.

Following a recent outbreak of canine distemper virus, a PVA was performed for the critically endangered island fox (&quot;Urocyon littoralis&quot;) of Santa Catalina Island, California. The Santa Catalina island fox population is uniquely composed of two subpopulations that are separated by an isthmus, with the eastern subpopulation at greater risk of extinction than the western subpopulation. PVA was conducted with the goals of 1) evaluating the island fox’s extinction risk, 2) estimating the island fox’s sensitivity to catastrophic events, and 3) evaluating recent recovery efforts which include release of captive-bred foxes and transport of wild juvenile foxes from the west to the east side. Results of the PVA concluded that the island fox is still at significant risk of extinction, and is highly susceptible to catastrophes that occur more than once every 20 years. Furthermore, extinction risks and future population sizes on both sides of the island were significantly dependent on the number of foxes released and transported each year.

PVAs in combination with sensitivity analysis can also be used to identify which vital rates has the relative greatest effect on population growth and other measures of population viability. For example, a study by Manlik &quot;et al.&quot; (2016) forecast the viability of two bottlenose dolphin populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between the two studies was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that temporal variation in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than temporal variation in survival.

==Controversy==

Debates exist and remain unresolved over the appropriate uses of PVA in conservation biology and PVA’s ability to accurately assess extinction risks.

A large quantity of field data is desirable for PVA; some conservatively estimate that for a precise extinction probability assessment extending &quot;T&quot; years into the future, five-to-ten times &quot;T&quot; years of data are needed. Datasets of such magnitude are typically unavailable for rare species; it has been estimated that suitable data for PVA is available for only 2% of threatened bird species. PVA for threatened and endangered species is particularly a problem as the predictive power of PVA plummets dramatically with minimal datasets. Ellner et al. (2002) argued that PVA has little value in such circumstances and is best replaced by other methods. Others argue that PVA remains the best tool available for estimations of extinction risk, especially with the use of sensitivity model runs.

Even with an adequate dataset, it is possible that a PVA can still have large errors in extinction rate predictions. It is impossible to incorporate all future possibilities into a PVA: habitats may change, catastrophes may occur, new diseases may be introduced. PVA utility can be enhanced by multiple model runs with varying sets of assumptions including the forecast future date. Some prefer to use PVA always in a relative analysis of benefits of alternative management schemes, such as comparing proposed resource management plans.

Accuracy of PVAs has been tested in a few retrospective studies. For example, a study comparing PVA model forecasts with the actual fate of 21 well-studied taxa, showed that growth rate projections are accurate, if input variables are based on sound data, but highlighted the importance of understanding density-dependence (Brook &quot;et al.&quot; 2000). Also, McCarthey &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) showed that PVA predictions are relatively accurate, when they are based on long-term data. Still, the usefulness of PVA lies more in its capacity to identify and assess potential threats, than in making long-term, categorical predictions (Akçakaya &amp; Sjögren-Gulve 2000).

==Future directions==
Improvements to PVA likely to occur in the near future include: 1) creating a fixed definition of PVA and scientific standards of quality by which all PVA are judged and 2) incorporating recent genetic advances into PVA.

<text>Enza Anderson (born 1964) is a Canadian journalist, media personality, Ontario politician, and transgender rights activist.

==Early life and education==
Anderson was born in Toronto, Ontario. Assigned male at birth, she grew up in Toronto, living near Jane and Finch with an Italian-Catholic father.

She initially attended York University to study geography but left due to a combination of lack of interest in the subject and her mother becoming sick. After a one-year hiatus, she attended Seneca College where she studied civil engineering and technologies.

==Early career==
After graduation she worked as the quality control supervisor of a concrete pipe-manufacturing plant, but was laid off after five years. She then worked part-time as a bartender at Woody&#x27;s.

In 1995 she got a job at a hair salon on Yonge Street, which called for her to hand out flyers for the salon to pedestrians in drag. It was during that job that a photo of her kissing then-mayor Mel Lastman ended up on the front cover of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, marking the start of her career in the public eye.

Anderson wrote a social column, &quot;The Hot Ticket&quot;, for Canada&#x27;s highest circulated free daily newspaper, &quot;Metro Toronto&quot;. She also divides her work schedule at the Bank of Montreal assisting clients as a financial services manager.

==Politics==

In 2000, Anderson ran for mayor of Toronto. Although the eventual winner of that campaign, Mel Lastman, won over 80% of the vote, Anderson garnered 13,585 votes, placing third behind Lastman and Tooker Gomberg. She was one of the few candidates besides Lastman, Gomberg and Ben Kerr to gain widespread name recognition in the race, even though her campaign largely consisted of standing on downtown street corners with a handmade placard bearing the slogan &quot;A Super City Deserves a Super Model!&quot;.

In 2002, Anderson ran for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance. She was unable to raise the $25,000 required by the party to register as a candidate, and dropped out of the race before the convention which ultimately chose Stephen Harper.

In the 2003 municipal election in Toronto, Anderson ran for a city council seat against incumbent Kyle Rae and placed second, though she was not considered to be a serious threat against him.

She ran and lost in the same ward in the 2010 municipal election.

==Media==
Anderson has a column in the Toronto newspaper &quot;Metro&quot;, covering local entertainment and party gossip since 2004, after she pitched the idea of her doing a column to the editor-in-chief, bringing a mocked-up version of one of her articles complete with &quot;Metro&quot; banner. She was also a fully clothed guest interviewer in the male version of &quot;Naked News&quot;.

She was the subject of a 2003 documentary by Carlos Valencia named &quot;A Man in a Dress&quot;, and was also interviewed speaking about her spirituality on Vision TV&#x27;s &quot;Credo&quot;. In 2015 Enza was the feature of her second documentary &quot;...When The Bullying Ends&quot; which was selected to screen at the 2016 Kolkata Shorts International Film Festival in India. Directed by queer filmmaker Raymond Helkio tells the story her work as an anti-bullying and queer rights activist.

Anderson was chosen as grand marshal of Toronto&#x27;s 2008 Pride Parade.

==Community activism==
Anderson served as a board member of the Church and Wellesley Neighbourhood Police Liaison Committee. Her two years as Pride Committee Co-chair of Fundraising helped raise record amounts needed to cover festival costs. She put in many fundraising hours for the AIDS Committee of Toronto and its signature fundraising event Fashion Cares. Anderson helped bring awareness of support groups like the People With AIDS Foundation and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Youth Support Line. She also served on the Federation of Metro Tenants&#x27; Associations. She also serves on the LGBT Consultative Committee-Toronto Police Service.

<text>Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological thriller film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel &quot;Twins&quot; by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a &quot;highly fictionalized&quot; version of the Marcuses&#x27; story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons&#x27; performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

==Plot==
Identical twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the clinic. When he gets tired of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a &quot;trifurcated cervix&quot;, meaning she will probably be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, upsetting the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire&#x27;s abuse of prescription drugs, which he abets through his doctor&#x27;s authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she angrily confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about &quot;mutant women&quot; with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre &quot;gynecological instruments&quot; for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck&#x27;s tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. He gashes her genitalia, causing her to bleed and alarming the surgical team, who restrain him and work to save the patient. Beverly collapses onto the patient, further exacerbating the scene by inhaling from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to &quot;synchronize&quot; with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to &quot;separate the Siamese twins&quot; and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck&#x27;s that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens to find that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks &quot;Who is this?&quot; Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies in Elliot&#x27;s dead arms.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
David Cronenberg proposed the idea of making a film about twins to Carol Baum at Lorimar in 1981. Baum told Cronenberg about Stewart and Cyril Marcus and sent articles written about the brothers and a book, &quot;Twins&quot; by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, to him. Cronenberg found an article in &quot;Esquire&quot; about the brothers titled &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;.

Baum and Joe Roth got Sylvio Tabet, a Lebanese producer, to finance the film. Cronenberg hired Norman Snider who wrote &quot;Secret Weapons&quot;, one of Cronenberg&#x27;s television films. Tabet wanted to begin filming with Snider&#x27;s first draft. Cronenberg rejected it and did another draft, but Sylvio disliked it and instead wanted to film the first draft. Cronenberg later stated that Tabet refused to pay him the $7,500 he was owed for working on the script. Tabet&#x27;s investment into the film ended in 1982.

Bob Bookman at ABC Motion Pictures was interested in the film, but Snider, Baum, Roth, and the source material were dropped to avoid complications. Cronenberg chose Andy Lewis, the writer of &quot;Klute&quot;, to write the script. Cronenberg criticized Lewis&#x27; approach to the film as Lewis wanted &quot;to demystify them, and not let them be amazing or strange&quot;, not &quot;impose any kind of mythology on twins&quot;, and wanted &quot;all twins to be normal people who just happened to be twins&quot;. Bookman was replaced by Stu Samuels, who was not interested in the film, and ABC Motion Pictures later dissolved.

Cronenberg wrote his own draft of the film based on Snider&#x27;s in 1982, and he stated that 60% of the script was his and 40% was Snider&#x27;s. Cronenberg previously worked with Dino De Laurentiis&#x27;s backing on &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and an unsuccessful adaption of &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Cronenberg proposed &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; with Raffaella De Laurentiis as producer after leaving &quot;Total Recall&quot;. However, Raffaella told Cronenberg that they could not fund the film due to their company&#x27;s past financial failures, including &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot;. She stated that &quot;I hope this isn&#x27;t another &quot;Platoon&quot; as the De Laurentiis gave up the critically and financially successful film during its production.

De Laurentiis considered making the film if the budget could be kept under $10 million, but by the time production was ended $300,000 worth of sets were constructed in leased buildings and Jeremy Irons agreed to do the film. It &quot;would have cost another $30,000 just to get rid of them&quot; according to Cronenberg. Cronenberg rented out the buildings they leased to other productions until another financial backer could be found. Roth and Jim Robinson formed Morgan Creek Entertainment which gave financial backing to the film.

===Casting===
In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because &quot;it is hard enough to play one role&quot;. The film marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in a scene.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said &quot;the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which&quot;, he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an &quot;internal way&quot; to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for &quot;different energy points&quot;, giving each character his own appearance.

===Filming===
Mark Irwin was meant to perform the cinematography for the film, but during the production delay he took a job in the United States and was replaced by Peter Suschitzky. The film&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;Twins&quot; due to a paid request from Ivan Reitman to avoid confusion with his film &quot;Twins&quot;.

Director Peter Greenaway claims that Cronenberg queried him about his film &quot;A Zed &amp; Two Noughts&quot; for two hours before going on to make &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; eight months later.

An additional dream sequence in which an aged version of one brother grows out of the abdomen of the other was cut by Cronenberg. He showed test audiences versions without the dream sequences, with one sequence, and with both sequences.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 49 reviews, and an average rating of 7.70/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Dead Ringers&quot; serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.&quot; According to the review aggregator Metacritic, the film received a weighted score of 86 out of 100 indicating “universal acclaim.” Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing &quot;it&#x27;s like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid&quot;, and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. &quot;Variety&quot; said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe assessed it as &quot;unnerving but also enthralling&quot;. For the same paper, Rita Kempley called it &quot;every woman&#x27;s nightmare turned into a creepy thriller&quot;, adding it was &quot;like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It&#x27;s really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious&quot;.

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Park Chan-wook and was voted for in the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll by Lalitha Gopalan. Filmmaker John Carpenter selected it as the tenth best film in his Criterion Collection list.

In 1999, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; as 95th on their list of &quot;100 Maverick Movies&quot;. &quot;Total Film&quot; placed &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; 35th on their list of the &quot;50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time&quot; while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed it 20th on their list of &quot;The 25 scariest movies of all time&quot;. It was named one of &quot;The Top 10 &#x27;True-Story&#x27; Horror Movies of All-time!&quot; by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; and &quot;Videodrome&quot; divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

===Box office===
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

===Accolades===
Irons won critics groups&#x27; Best Actor awards for &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot;, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

==Television adaptation==
In 2005, it was announced that HBO would make a television series based on &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; with Cronenberg writing. Wesley Strick proposed the idea to Cronenberg, but the series was never made.

On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video placed a straight-to-series order for a television adaptation of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, with Rachel Weisz set to star. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role. The miniseries premiered on April 21, 2023, consisting of six episodes.

<doc id="826484" wikidata="Q2725758" url="?curid=826484" title="ISO 3166-1 numeric">
<text>ISO 3166-1 numeric (or numeric-3) codes are three-digit country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. They are similar to the three-digit country codes developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, from which they originate in its UN M.49 standard. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its second edition in 1981, but they were released by the United Nations Statistics Division since as early as 1970.

An advantage of numeric codes over alphabetic codes is script (writing system) independence. The ISO 3166-1 alphabetic codes (alpha-2 and alpha-3) use letters from the 26-letter English alphabet and are suitable for languages based on the Latin alphabet. For people and systems using non-Latin scripts (such as Arabic or Japanese), the English alphabet may be unavailable or difficult to use, understand, or correctly interpret. While numeric codes overcome the problems of script dependence, this independence comes at the cost of loss of mnemonic convenience.

Another advantage is that when countries merge or split, they will get a new numeric code, while the alphabetic code stays in use for (a part of) that country. A persistent number is needed in datasets with historical country information.

==Current codes==
===Officially assigned code elements===
The following is a complete list of the current officially assigned ISO 3166-1 numeric codes, using a title case version of the English short names officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA):

===User-assigned code elements===
User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1. The ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The numeric codes to can be user-assigned.

Examples include for Kosovo and for Cyprus used by Dun &amp; Bradstreet.

==Withdrawn codes==
When countries merge, split, or undergo territorial change, their numeric codes are withdrawn and new numeric codes are assigned. For example:
* East Germany and West Germany used numeric codes and respectively before their unification in 1990. Since then, the unified Germany has used numeric code , while keeping the alphabetic codes for West Germany (except in the banking area where they still use the code).
* Ethiopia used numeric code before Eritrea split away in 1993. Since then, Ethiopia has used numeric code , while keeping the same alphabetic codes.
* Sudan used numeric code before South Sudan split away in 2011. Since then, Sudan has used numeric code , while keeping the same alphabetic codes.

If a country changes its name without any territorial change, its numeric code remains the same. For example, when Burma was renamed Myanmar without territorial change in 1989, its alphabetic codes were changed, but its numeric code has remained the same.

The following numeric codes have been withdrawn from ISO 3166-1:

The following numeric codes were also assigned by the United Nations Statistics Division, but these territories were never officially included in ISO 3166-1:

In the UN M.49 standard developed by the United Nations Statistics Division, additional numeric codes are used to represent geographical regions and groupings of countries and areas for statistical processing purposes, but these codes are not included in ISO 3166-1. Unlike alphabetic codes, there are no reserved numeric codes in ISO 3166-1.

<text>Alexander Austin Willis, (30 September 1917 – 4 April 2004) was a Canadian actor and television host.

==Biography==

Austin was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia to parents Alexander Samuel and Emma Graham (Pushie) Willis. His older brother, J. Frank Willis, was a radio broadcaster with the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (later the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).

In 2002, Austin was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He is best known internationally for his appearance as Simmons, the man whom Auric Goldfinger beats at cards in the opening scenes of the James Bond film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Originally he was to have played Felix Leiter but, at the last minute, fellow Canadian Cec Linder switched roles with him.

In Canada, he had a varied film and TV career, ranging from the early science-fiction series &quot;Space Command&quot;, to hosting &quot;Cross-Canada Hit Parade&quot; for several years in the 1950s. In the 1970s he found new fans as the host of the humorous game show &quot;This Is the Law&quot;. He also hosted the TV filler program &quot;So The Story Goes&quot;.

Willis was married twice. His first marriage was in 1953, to Canadian actress Kate Reid, and they had two children together before divorcing in 1962. He married Gwen LaForty in 1984, and was with her until his death, at 86, in 2004.

<text>Cill Rónáin (), unofficially anglicized as Kilronan, is the main settlement on Inishmore, one of the Aran Islands off the coast of County Galway in Ireland. The ferries serving the island call at Doolin, County Clare and also Rossaveal, County Galway. The main industries are fishing and tourism. The village is situated in the Gaeltacht (Irish speaking district), and thus only the Irish version of the name has any legal or official status. Schoolchildren visit the village to improve their Irish at summer schools. As of 2016, 247 people live in the village and 43.3% of the population speak Irish on a daily basis outside the education system.

==Popular culture==
Kilronan is the subject of The Magnetic Fields&#x27;s song &quot;Abigail, Belle of Kilronan&quot; from their album &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;.

<doc id="826507" wikidata="Q3648625" url="?curid=826507" title="CDC Cyber">
<text>The CDC Cyber range of mainframe-class supercomputers were the primary products of Control Data Corporation (CDC) during the 1970s and 1980s. In their day, they were the computer architecture of choice for scientific and mathematically intensive computing. They were used for modeling fluid flow, material science stress analysis, electrochemical machining analysis, probabilistic analysis, energy and academic computing, radiation shielding modeling, and other applications. The lineup also included the Cyber 18 and Cyber 1000 minicomputers. Like their predecessor, the CDC 6600, they were unusual in using the ones&#x27; complement binary representation.

==Models==
The Cyber line included five different series of computers:

* The 70 and 170 series based on the architecture of the CDC 6600 and CDC 7600 supercomputers, respectively
* The 200 series based on the CDC STAR-100—released in the 1970s.
* The 180 series developed by a team in Canada—released in the 1980s (after the 200 series)
* The Cyberplus or Advanced Flexible Processor (AFP)
* The Cyber 18 minicomputer based on the CDC 1700

Primarily aimed at large office applications instead of the traditional supercomputer tasks, some of the Cyber machines nevertheless included basic vector instructions for added performance in traditional CDC roles.

===Cyber 70 and 170 series===

The Cyber 70 and 170 architectures were successors to the earlier CDC 6600 and CDC 7600 series and therefore shared almost all of the earlier architecture&#x27;s characteristics. The Cyber-70 series is a minor upgrade from the earlier systems. The Cyber-73 was largely the same hardware as the CDC 6400 - with the addition of a Compare and Move Unit (CMU). The CMU instructions speeded up comparison and moving of non-word aligned 6-bit character data. The Cyber-73 could be configured with either one or two CPUs. The dual CPU version replaced the CDC 6500. As was the case with the CDC 6200, CDC also offered a Cyber-72. The Cyber-72 had identical hardware to a Cyber-73, but added additional clock cycles to each instruction to slow it down. This allowed CDC to offer a lower performance version at a lower price point without the need to develop new hardware. It could also be delivered with dual CPUs. The Cyber 74 was an updated version of the CDC 6600. The Cyber 76 was essentially a renamed CDC 7600. Neither the Cyber-74 nor the Cyber-76 had CMU instructions.

The Cyber-170 series represented CDCs move from discrete electronic components and core memory to integrated circuits and semiconductor memory. The 172, 173, and 174 use integrated circuits and semiconductor memory whereas the 175 uses high-speed discrete transistors. The Cyber-170/700 series is a late-1970s refresh of the Cyber-170 line.

The central processor (CPU) and central memory (CM) operated in units of 60-bit words. In CDC lingo, the term &quot;byte&quot; referred to 12-bit entities (which coincided with the word size used by the peripheral processors). Characters were six bits, operation codes were six bits, and central memory addresses were 18 bits. Central processor instructions were either 15 bits or 30 bits.
The 18-bit addressing inherent to the Cyber 170 series imposed a limit of 262,144 (256K) words of main memory, which is semiconductor memory in this series. The central processor has no I/O instructions, relying upon the peripheral processor (PP) units to do I/O.

A Cyber 170-series system consists of one or two CPUs that run at either 25 or 40 MHz, and is equipped with 10, 14, 17, or 20 peripheral processors (PP), and up to 24 high-performance channels for high-speed I/O. Due to the relatively slow memory reference times of the CPU (in some models, memory reference instructions were slower than floating-point divides), the higher-end CPUs (e.g., Cyber-74, Cyber-76, Cyber-175, and Cyber-176) are equipped with eight or twelve words of high-speed memory used as an instruction cache. Any loop that fit into the cache (which is usually called &quot;in-stack&quot;) runs very fast, without referencing main memory for instruction fetch. The lower-end models do not contain an instruction stack. However, since up to four instructions are packed into each 60-bit word, some degree of prefetching is inherent in the design.

As with predecessor systems, the Cyber 170 series has eight 18-bit address registers (A0 through A7), eight 18-bit index registers (B0 through B7), and eight 60-bit operand registers (X0 through X7). Seven of the A registers are tied to their corresponding X register. Setting A1 through A5 reads that address and fetches it into the corresponding X1 through X5 register. Likewise, setting register A6 or A7 writes the corresponding X6 or X7 register to central memory at the address written to the A register. A0 is effectively a scratch register.

The higher-end CPUs consisted of multiple functional units (e.g., shift, increment, floating add) which allowed some degree of parallel execution of instructions. This parallelism allows assembly programmers to minimize the effects of the system&#x27;s slow memory fetch time by &quot;pre-fetching&quot; data from central memory well before that data is needed. By interleaving independent instructions between the memory fetch instruction and the instructions manipulating the fetched operand, the time occupied by the memory fetch can be used for other computation. With this technique, coupled with the handcrafting of tight loops that fit within the instruction stack, a skilled Cyber assembly programmer can write extremely efficient code that makes the most of the power of the hardware.

The peripheral processor subsystem uses a technique known as &quot;barrel and slot&quot; to share the execution unit; each PP had its own memory and registers, but the processor (the slot) itself executed one instruction from each PP in turn (the barrel). This is a crude form of hardware multiprogramming. The peripheral processors have 4096 bytes of 12-bit memory words and an 18-bit accumulator register. Each PP has access to all I/O channels and all of the system&#x27;s central memory (CM) in addition to the PP&#x27;s own memory. The PP instruction set lacks, for example, extensive arithmetic capabilities and does not run user code; the peripheral processor subsystem&#x27;s purpose is to process I/O and thereby free the more powerful central processor unit(s) to running user computations.

A feature of the lower Cyber CPUs is the Compare Move Unit (CMU). It provides four additional instructions intended to aid text processing applications. In an unusual departure from the rest of the 15- and 30-bit instructions, these are 60-bit instructions (three actually use all 60 bits, the other use 30 bits, but its alignment requires 60 bits to be used). The instructions are: move a short string, move a long string, compare strings, and compare a collated string. They operate on six-bit fields (numbered 1 through 10) in central memory. For example, a single instruction can specify &quot;move the 72 character string starting at word 1000 character 3 to location 2000 character 9&quot;. The CMU hardware is not included in the higher-end Cyber CPUs, because hand coded loops could run as fast or faster than the CMU instructions.

Later systems typically run CDC&#x27;s NOS (Network Operating System). Version 1 of NOS continued to be updated until about 1981; NOS version 2 was released early 1982, with the final version of 2.8.7 PSR 871, delivered in December 1997, which continues to have minor unofficial bug fixes, Y2K mitigation, etc in support of DtCyber. Besides NOS, the only other operating systems commonly used on the 170 series was &quot;NOS/BE&quot; or its predecessor &quot;SCOPE&quot;, a product of CDC&#x27;s Sunnyvale division. These operating systems provide time-sharing of batch and interactive applications. The predecessor to NOS was &quot;Kronos&quot; which was in common use up until 1975 or so. Due to the strong dependency of developed applications on the particular installation&#x27;s character set, many installations chose to run the older operating systems rather than convert their applications. Other installations would patch newer versions of the operating system to use the older character set to maintain application compatibility.

===Cyber 180 series===
Cyber 180 development began in the Advanced Systems Laboratory, a joint CDC/NCR development venture started in 1973 and located in Escondido, California. The machine family was originally called Integrated Product Line (IPL) and was intended to be a virtual memory replacement for the NCR 6150 and CDC Cyber 70 product lines. The IPL system was also called the Cyber 80 in development documents. The Software Writer&#x27;s Language (SWL), a high-level Pascal-like language, was developed for the project with the intent that all languages and the operating system (IPLOS) were going to be written in SWL. SWL was later renamed PASCAL-X and eventually became Cybil. The joint venture was abandoned in 1976, with CDC continuing system development and renaming the Cyber 80 as Cyber 180. The first machines of the series were announced in 1982 and the product announcement for the NOS/VE operating system occurred in 1983.

As the computing world standardized to an eight-bit byte size, CDC customers started pushing for the Cyber machines to do the same. The result was a new series of systems that could operate in both 60- and 64-bit modes. The 64-bit operating system was called NOS/VE, and supported the virtual memory capabilities of the hardware. The older 60-bit operating systems, NOS and NOS/BE, could run in a special address space for compatibility with the older systems.

The true 180-mode machines are microcoded processors that can support both instruction sets simultaneously. Their hardware is completely different from the earlier 6000/70/170 machines. The small 170-mode exchange package was mapped into the much larger 180-mode exchange package; within the 180-mode exchange package, there is a virtual machine identifier (VMID) that determines whether the 8/16/64-bit two&#x27;s complement 180 instruction set or the 12/60-bit ones&#x27; complement 170 instruction set is executed.

There were three true 180s in the initial lineup, codenamed P1, P2, P3. P2 and P3 were larger water-cooled designs. The P2 was designed in Mississauga, Ontario, by the same team that later designed the smaller P1, and the P3 was designed in Arden Hills, Minnesota. The P1 was a novel air-cooled, 60-board cabinet designed by a group in Mississauga; the P1 ran on 60 Hz current (no motor-generator sets needed). A fourth high-end 180 model 990 (codenamed THETA) was also under development in Arden Hills.

The 180s were initially marketed as 170/8xx machines with no mention of the new 8/64-bit system inside. However, the primary control program is a 180-mode program known as Environmental Interface (EI). The 170 operating system (NOS) used a single, large, fixed page within the main memory. There were a few clues that an alert user could pick up on, such as the &quot;building page tables&quot; message that flashed on the operator&#x27;s console at startup and deadstart panels with 16 (instead of 12) toggle switches per PP word on the P2 and P3.

The peripheral processors in the true 180s are always 16-bit machines with the sign bit determining whether a 16/64 bit or 12/60 bit PP instruction is being executed. The single word I/O instructions in the PPs are always 16-bit instructions, so at deadstart the PPs can set up the proper environment to run both EI plus NOS and the customer&#x27;s existing 170-mode software. To hide this process from the customer, earlier in the 1980s CDC had ceased distribution of the source code for its Deadstart Diagnostic Sequence (DDS) package and turned it into the proprietary Common Tests &amp; Initialization (CTI) package.

The initial 170/800 lineup was: 170/825 (P1), 170/835 (P2), 170/855 (P3), 170/865 and 170/875. The 825 was released initially after some delay loops had been added to its microcode; it seemed the design folks in Toronto had done a little too well and it was too close to the P2 in performance. The 865 and 875 models were revamped 170/760 heads (one or two processors with 6600/7600-style parallel functional units) with larger memories. The 865 used normal 170 memory; the 875 took its faster main processor memory from the &quot;Cyber 205&quot; line.

A year or two after the initial release, CDC announced the 800-series&#x27; true capabilities to its customers, and the true 180s were relabeled as the 180/825 (P1), 180/835 (P2), and 180/855 (P3). At some point, the model 815 was introduced with the delayed microcode and the faster microcode was restored to the model 825. Eventually the THETA was released as the &quot;Cyber 990&quot;.

===Cyber 200 series===
In 1974, CDC introduced the STAR architecture. The STAR is an entirely new 64-bit design with virtual memory and vector processing instructions added for high performance on a certain class of math tasks. The STAR&#x27;s vector pipeline is a &quot;memory to memory&quot; pipe, which supports vector lengths of up to 65,536 elements. The latencies of the vector pipeline are very long, so peak speed is approached only when very long vectors are used. The scalar processor was deliberately simplified to provide room for the vector processor and is relatively slow in comparison to the CDC 7600. As such, the original STAR proved to be a great disappointment when it was released (see Amdahl&#x27;s Law). Best estimates claim that three STAR-100 systems were delivered.

It appeared that all of the problems in the STAR were solvable. In the late 1970s, CDC addressed some of these issues with the &quot;Cyber 203&quot;. The new name kept with their new branding, and perhaps to distance itself from the STAR&#x27;s failure. The Cyber 203 contains redesigned scalar processing and loosely coupled I/O design, but retains the STAR&#x27;s vector pipeline. Best estimates claim that two Cyber 203s were delivered or upgraded from STAR-100s.

In 1980, the successor to the Cyber 203, the &quot;Cyber 205&quot; was announced. The UK Meteorological Office at Bracknell, England was the first customer and they received their Cyber 205 in 1981. The Cyber 205 replaces the STAR vector pipeline with redesigned vector pipelines: both scalar and vector units utilized ECL gate array ICs and are cooled with Freon. Cyber 205 systems were available with two or four vector pipelines, with the four-pipe version theoretically delivering 400 64-bit MFLOPs and 800 32-bit MFLOPs. These speeds are rarely seen in practice other than by handcrafted assembly language. The ECL gate array ICs contain 168 logic gates each, with the clock tree networks being tuned by hand-crafted coax length adjustment. The instruction set would be considered V-CISC (very complex instruction set) among modern processors. Many specialized operations facilitate hardware searches, matrix mathematics, and special instructions that enable decryption.

The original Cyber 205 was renamed to &quot;Cyber 205 Series 400&quot; in 1983 when the Cyber 205 Series 600 was introduced. The Series 600 differs in memory technology and packaging but is otherwise the same. A single four-pipe Cyber 205 was installed. All other sites appear to be two-pipe installations with final count to be determined.

The Cyber 205 architecture evolved into the ETA10 as the design team spun off into ETA Systems in September 1983. A final development was the Cyber 250, which was scheduled for release in 1987 priced at $20 million; it was later renamed the ETA30 after ETA Systems was absorbed back into CDC.

==== CDC CYBER 205 ====
* Architecture: ECL/LSI logic
** 20 ns cycle time (or 50 MHz)
* Up to 800 Mflops FP32 ans 400 Mflops FP64
* 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 million 64-bit words with 25.6 or 51.2 Gigabits/second
* 8 I/O ports with up to 16 200 Mbits/second each

===Cyberplus or Advanced Flexible Processor (AFP)===
Each Cyberplus (aka Advanced Flexible Processor, AFP) is a 16-bit processor with optional 64-bit floating point capabilities and has 256 K or 512 K words of 64-bit memory. The AFP was the successor to the Flexible Processor (FP), whose design development started in 1972 under black-project circumstances targeted at processing radar and photo image data. The FP control unit had a hardware network for conditional microinstruction execution, with four mask registers and a condition-hold register; three bits in the microinstruction format select among nearly 50 conditions for determining execution, including result sign and overflow, I/O conditions, and loop control.

At least 21 Cyberplus multiprocessor installations were operational in 1986. These parallel processing systems include from 1 to 256 Cyberplus processors providing 250 MFLOPS each, which are connected to an existing Cyber system via a direct memory interconnect architecture (MIA), this was available on NOS 2.2 for the Cyber 170/835, 845, 855 and 180/990 models.

Physically, each Cyberplus processor unit was of typical mainframe module size, similar to the Cyber 180 systems, with the exact width dependent on whether the optional FPU was installed, and weighed approximately 1 tonne.

; Software that was bundled with the Cyberplus was:
* System software
* FORTRAN cross compiler
* MICA (Machine Instruction Cross Assembler)
* Load File Builder Utility
* ECHOS (simulator)
* Debug facility
* Dump utility
* Dump analyzer utility
* Maintenance software

Some sites using the Cyberplus were the University of Georgia and the Gesellschaft für Trendanalysen (GfTA) (&quot;Association for Trend Analyses&quot;) in Germany.

A fully configured 256 processor Cyberplus system would have a theoretical performance of 64 GFLOPS, and weigh around 256 tonnes. A nine-unit system was reputedly capable of performing comparative analysis (including pre-processing convolutions) on 1 megapixel images at a rate of one image pair per second.

===Cyber 18===
The Cyber 18 is a 16-bit minicomputer which was a successor to the CDC 1700 minicomputer. It was mostly used in real-time environments. One noteworthy application is as the basis of the 2550—a communications processor used by CDC 6000 series and Cyber 70/Cyber 170 mainframes. The 2550 was a product of CDC&#x27;s Communications Systems Division, in Santa Ana, California (STAOPS). STAOPS also produced another communication processor (CP), used in networks hosted by IBM mainframes. This M1000 CP, later renamed C1000, came from an acquisition of Marshall MDM Communications. A three-board set was added to the Cyber 18 to create the 2550.

The Cyber 18 was generally programmed in Pascal and assembly language; FORTRAN, BASIC, and RPG II were also available. Operating systems included RTOS (Real-Time Operating System), MSOS 5 (Mass Storage Operating System), and TIMESHARE 3 (time-sharing system).

&quot;Cyber 18-17&quot; was just a new name for the System 17, based on the 1784 processor. Other Cyber 18s (Cyber 18-05, 18-10, 18-20, and 18-30) had microprogrammable processors with up to 128K words of memory, four additional general registers, and an enhanced instruction set. The Cyber 18-30 had dual processors. A special version of the Cyber 18, known as the MP32, that was 32-bit instead of 16-bit was created for the National Security Agency for crypto-analysis work. The MP32 had the Fortran math runtime library package built into its microcode. The Soviet Union tried to buy several of these systems and they were being built when the U.S. Government cancelled the order. The parts for the MP32 were absorbed into the Cyber 18 production. One of the uses of the Cyber 18 was monitoring the Alaskan Pipeline.

===Cyber 1000===
The M1000 / C1000, later renamed Cyber 1000, was used as a message store and forward system used by the Federal Reserve System. A version of the Cyber 1000 with its hard drive removed was used by Bell Telephone. This was a RISC processor (reduced instruction set computer). An improved version known as the Cyber 1000-2 with the Line Termination Sub-System added 256 Zilog Z80 microprocessors. The Bell Operating Companies purchased large numbers of these systems in the mid-to-late 1980s for data communications. In the late 1980s the XN10 was released with an improved processor (a direct memory access instruction was added) as well as a size reduction from two cabinets to one. The XN20 was an improved version of the XN10 with a much smaller footprint. The Line Termination Sub-System was redesigned to use the improved Z180 microprocessor (the Buffer Controller card, Programmable Line Controller card and two Communication Line Interface cards were incorporated on to a single card). The XN20 was in pre-production stage when the Communication Systems Division was shut down in 1992.

Jack Ralph was the chief architect of the Cyber 1000-2, XN-10 and XN-20 systems. Dan Nay was the chief engineer of the XN-20.

<text>Stefka Georgieva Kostadinova (; born 25 March 1965) is a Bulgarian former athlete who competed in the high jump. Her world record of 2.09 metres stood since 1987 until being broken by Yaroslava Mahuchikh in 2024 (record not verified). She is the 1996 Olympic champion, a two-time World champion, and a five-time World Indoor champion. She has been the president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee since 2005.

==Early career==
Born in Plovdiv, Kostadinova went to a specialist sports school, but was only introduced to high jump in a Year Six (12–13-year-olds) athletics meet in Sofia, on a day she is quoted as saying she would never forget (on TransWorldSport interview in 2012).

==Career==
Kostadinova was reigning world record holder in the women&#x27;s high jump until July 2024. She set a world record of 2.09 m at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome. Altogether Kostadinova set seven world records - three outdoors and four indoors. She also holds the distinction of having jumped over 2.00 m 197 times.

Kostadinova won the gold medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, setting an Olympic record of 2.05 m. She also won a silver medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Kostadinova won the outdoor World Championships in 1987 and 1995. She won the World Indoor Championship five times between 1985 and 1997. Kostadinova also won gold in all European Championships in Athletics in which she competed. She was a European outdoor champion in Stuttgart in 1986 and a four-time European indoor champion in 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1994.

Kostadinova was voted Sportsperson of the Year in Bulgaria four times (1985, 1987, 1995 and 1996).

==Personal life==
In 1995 Kostadinova gave birth to her son, Nikolay, just several months before winning gold in the 1995 World Championships in Athletics. In 1999 she divorced her long-standing husband and coach, Nikolay Petrov. The same year she officially put an end to her athletic career, though she had actually not participated in any major sports competition since the World Indoors Championship in 1997. In 2007 Kostadinova married businessman Nikolai Popvasilev.

==Sports administration career==
After retiring Kostadinova started a career in sports administration. She has served as vice president of the Bulgarian Athletic Federation, vice president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee and was deputy sports minister of Bulgaria from 2003 through 2005.

On 11 November 2005, Kostadinova was elected president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee. She replaced Ivan Slavkov, who was expelled by the International Olympic Committee for violating its standards in ethics.

<text>Kevin Patterson (born December 27, 1964) is a Canadian medical doctor and writer. His short story collection, &quot;Country of Cold,&quot; won the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize in 2003. His latest book, &quot;Outside the Wire: The War in Afghanistan in the Words of its Participants&quot;, published in 2008, is a collection of first-hand accounts written by soldiers, doctors and aid workers on the front lines of Canada&#x27;s war in Afghanistan.

==Early life==
Kevin Patterson was born on December 27, 1964, in Kapuskasing, Ontario and raised in Selkirk, Manitoba. He put himself through medical school at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg by enlisting in the Canadian army. When his service was up, he worked as a doctor in the Arctic and on the coast of British Columbia while pursuing his MFA in creative writing at the University of British Columbia.

==Writing career==
In 1999, Patterson published &quot;The Water in Between&quot;, a travel memoir of his sailing expedition in the Pacific Ocean. The book was nominated for the 2000 Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction. His first novel, &quot;Consumption&quot;, was published in September 2006 in Canada. He co-edited &quot;Outside the Wire: The War in Afghanistan in the Words of its Participants&quot;, which was released in January 2008.

===&quot;Talk to Me Like My Father&quot;===
&quot;Talk to Me Like My Father&quot;, Patterson&#x27;s account of spending six weeks as a doctor with NATO forces in Afghanistan in the winter of 2007, was published in the July–August issue of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine in the U.S. The article created news headlines in Canada because of Patterson&#x27;s graphic description of the dying moments of Nova Scotia-born soldier Kevin Megeney.

Although Megeney&#x27;s name had previously been published in Canadian media, the Canadian Department of National Defence initiated a military police investigation into Patterson&#x27;s conduct to determine whether or not he breached doctor-patient confidentiality. He was later cleared when the DND received confirmation from Megeney&#x27;s mother that she had consented to the publication of the article. However, in January 2009 he was officially censured by the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons and ordered to pay $5,000 in costs.

<text>Mickey Zucker Reichert (born as Miriam Susan Zucker in 1962) is an American fantasy fiction author of several best selling novels.

== Personal life ==
Reichert is a pediatrician, and holds a Doctorate of Medicine (M.D.). She is from a town in Iowa. She and her husband have fostered and adopted children, as well as a variety of animals &quot;from mice to horses&quot;.

Her novels are published by DAW Books. DAW published her first novel via Sheila Gilbert, who is still Reichert&#x27;s editor over 25 years later.

Zucker-Reichert is an experienced and passionate wildlife rescuer. Her snaring techniques were involved in the rescue of the endangered gopher tortoise. Seeing that it could outrun her, she created advanced snaring methodology and techniques that are now utilized to save the species from extinction.

== Notable works ==
Reichert has published more than 22 novels, an illustrated novella, and more than 50 short stories.

=== Renshai series ===
She is known for her &quot;Renshai&quot; series, which provides a different perspective on traditional Norse mythology. It is the story of a battle between good vs evil vs neutrality. It focuses around Norse mythology. The story largely centers around the survivors from a tribe of master swordsmen who are decimated in a coordinated attack by the majority of their neighboring countries, and a few other characters.

These three books focus on the character of Colbey Calistinsson in addition to other characters that play central roles in the storyline. Colbey is the most skilled swordsman the Renshai tribe has ever known. Yet, after his tribe is almost completely eradicated, he is forced to search for purpose and also determine a new course for his existence. Otherwise the evil forces of the East will destroy the neutral forces of the West in the Great War that is prophesied to plunge more than half of the continent in a violent war.

Later in the series Colbey acquires powerful telepathic and psychic abilities. This, he discovers in the third book, stems from his heritage. Colbey is in fact the son of Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, and the grandson of Odin, King of the Norse Gods. He is the son of a god and a mortal woman from a mighty warrior tribe (Renshai). However, true to character, he is undaunted by this knowledge, and soldiers on through many quests with his sense of purpose and his dedication to only do what he feels is right regardless of the consequences - even if it may possibly result in the Ragnarok and bring about the end of the world. Eventually, he marries the goddess Freya.

===&quot; I, Robot&quot; ===
Reichert was asked to write three prequels to &quot;I, Robot&quot; by &quot;Isaac Asimov&quot;&#x27;s estate. She first met Asimov when she was 23, although she did not know him well. The prequels were ordered by Berkley Books.

<text>Sanguma was a Papua New Guinean musical ensemble active from 1977 to 1985. They combined music from the cultural traditions of Papua New Guinea with Western instruments and were one of the first Papua New Guinean music groups to perform internationally. Sanguma formed at the &quot;National Arts School&quot; in 1977 and performed in their homeland at the &quot;South Pacific Festival of Arts&quot; in 1980. Sanguma were nurtured very closely in their early days by the Australian musician Ric Halstead, who was a lecturer at the National Arts School in Port Moresby from whence Sanguma originated and Les McLaren.

Sanguma produced six albums in cassette format; the two eponymously titled Sanguma 1 and Sanguma 2 in the late 1970s also Sanguma Live vol 1 and 2 and ‘Eberia’ with the National Dance Company and in 1983, &#x27;Sanguma Suites&#x27;, an adventurous excursion into progressive/traditional/rock/jazz/fusion composed by band members Tony Subam (East Sepik Province) and Sebastian Miyoni (Milne Bay Province) and ostensibly by these two musicians rather than the band Sanguma, but as the band featured heavily on the album it was in all but name a Sanguma album.
The first two albums were somewhat better received than was Sanguma Suites as they were closer to the traditional music of Papua New Guinea. All the albums utilised modern amplified instrumentation to supplement the traditional flutes, drums and vocal sequences. In 1979 Sanguma toured PNG performing in Lae, Goroka, Madang, Wewak, Manus and Alotau. In 1980 they performed at the opening of the P.N.G High Commission in Canberra, Australia as well as performing in Kings Cross in Sydney and the Bondi Hotel. Sanguma also performed in Düsseldorf in Germany and whilst on route took time out to climb the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Sanguma also performed in Japan, These ventures were under the guidance of Ric Halstead who was their mentor from 1979 to 1982. Sanguma supported UK reggae band Steel Pulse on a tour of the US West Coast in 1983, receiving favourable reviews and attracting interest in Papua New Guinea&#x27;s traditions and indirectly promoting the nascent tourist industry.

Hearing the Future: The Music and Magic of the Sanguma Band, by Denis Crowdy, was published in January 2016 by University of Hawai&#x27;i Press in their series on Music and Performing Arts of Asia and the Pacific. A brief description of the book is as follows:

&quot;During the turbulent decades of the 1970s and 1980s, Papua New Guinea gained political independence from a colonial hold that had lasted almost a century. It was an exciting time for a diverse group of pioneering musicians who formed a band they named &quot;Sanguma.&quot; These Melanesian artists heard an imagined future and performed it during a socially and politically critical time for the region. They were united under one goal: to create a sound that represented the birth of a new, sovereign, and distinctly Melanesian nation; and to express their values, identities, and cosmology through their music and performance. Sanguma&#x27;s experimental music sounded the complex expectations and pressures of their modern nation and helped to steer its postcolonial journey through music.

In Hearing the Future, Australian ethnomusicologist Denis Crowdy documents and analyzes the music and activities of the Sanguma band, arguing that their music was a vital form of cultural expression in sync with sociopolitical change then taking place in PNG. Drawing from rock, jazz, and nascent &quot;world music&quot; influences, Sanguma reached audiences far from their home nation, introducing the world to modern music, Melanesia-style, with its fusion of old and new, local and global. Performances ranged from ensembles of Melanesian log drums (garamuts) to extended songs and improvisations involving electric guitars, synthesizers, saxophone, trumpet, bamboo percussion, panpipes, and kuakumba flutes. The band sang in a variety of local vernacular languages, as well as in Tok Pisin and English. To further emphasize their ancestral style, the musicians wore decorative headdresses and body decoration from all around the nation, along with distinctive pants featuring indigenous designs.&quot;

<text>YDbDr, sometimes written formula_1, is the colour space used in the SECAM (adopted in France and some countries of the former Eastern Bloc) analog colour television broadcasting standard. It is very close to YUV (used on the PAL system) and its related colour spaces such as YIQ (used on the NTSC system), YPbPr and YCbCr.

formula_1 is composed of three components: formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5. formula_3 is the luminance, formula_4 and formula_5 are the chrominance components, representing the red and blue colour differences.

== Formulas ==
The three component signals are created from an original formula_9 (red, green and blue) source. The weighted values of formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12 are added together to produce a single formula_3 signal, representing the overall brightness, or luminance, of that spot. The formula_4 signal is then created by subtracting the formula_3 from the blue signal of the original formula_9, and then scaling; and formula_5 by subtracting the formula_3 from the red, and then scaling by a different factor.

These formulae approximate the conversion between the RGB colour space and formula_1.

You may note that the formula_3 component of formula_1 is the same as the formula_3 component of formula_3formula_27formula_28. formula_4 and formula_5 are related to the formula_27 and formula_28 components of the YUV colour space as follows:

<text>YPbPr or formula_1, also written as , is a color space used in video electronics, in particular in reference to component video cables. Like YCBCR, it is based on gamma corrected RGB primaries; the two are numerically equivalent but YPBPR is designed for use in analog systems while YCBCR is intended for digital video. The EOTF (gamma correction) may be different from common sRGB EOTF and BT.1886 EOTF. Sync is carried on the Y channel and is a bi-level sync signal, but in HD formats a tri-level sync is used and is typically carried on all channels. 

YPBPR is commonly referred to as &quot;component video&quot; by manufacturers; however, there are many types of component video, most of which are some form of RGB. Some video cards come with video-in video-out (VIVO) ports for connecting to component video devices.

==Technical details==
formula_1 can be derived from a gamma corrected formula_3 signal with a typical range of 0-700 mV. The first step is converting to formula_4, formula_5 and formula_6.

formula_4carries luma (brightness or &quot;luminance&quot;) and synchronization (sync) information. Luma is defined as:
* formula_8 for Hi-Vision;
* formula_9 for HDTV;
* formula_10 for SDTV;
formula_5carries the difference between red and luma, defined as:
* formula_12for Hi-Vision and HDTV;
* formula_13 for SDTV.
formula_6carries the difference between blue and luma, defined as:
* formula_15 for Hi-Vision and HDTV;
* formula_16 for SDTV.
These formula_5 and formula_6 values are then scaled to obtain normalized formula_19 and formula_20 values in the range of +/- 350 mV:

* formula_21 and formula_22 for Hi-Vision;
* formula_23 and formula_24 for HDTV;
* formula_25 and formula_26 for SDTV.

There are other standards of components derivation available: 

* SMPTE 240M (240M defined EOTF and uses SMPTE 170M primaries and white point) for 1920x1035;
* BT.601 matrix for 525 lines 60/1.001 Hz (SMPTE 273M) and 625 lines 50 Hz (ITU-R BT.1358).

To send a green signal as a fourth component is redundant, as it can be derived using the blue, red and luma information.

When color signals were first added to the NTSC-encoded black and white video standard, the hue was represented by a phase shift of a color reference sub-carrier. &quot;P&quot; for phase information or phase shift has carried through to represent color information even in the case where there is no longer a phase shift used to represent hue. Thus, the YPBPR nomenclature derives from engineering metrics developed for the NTSC color standard.

The same cables can be used for and composite video. This means that the yellow, red, and white RCA connector cables commonly packaged with most audio/visual equipment can be used in place of the YPBPR connectors, provided the end user is careful to connect each cable to corresponding components at both ends. Also, many TVs use the green connection either for luma only or for composite video input. Since is backwards compatible with the luminance portion of composite video even with just component video decoding one can still use composite video via this input, but only luma information will be displayed, along with the chroma dots. The same goes the other way around so long as 480i or 576i is used.

== YPBPR advantages ==

Signals using offer enough separation that no color multiplexing is needed, so the quality of the extracted image is nearly identical to the pre-encoded signal. S-Video and composite video mix the signals together by means of electronic multiplexing. Signal degradation is typical for composite video, as most display systems are unable to completely separate the signals, though HDTVs tend to perform such separation better than most CRT units (see dot crawl). S-Video can mitigate some of these potential issues, as its luma is transmitted separately from chroma.

Among consumer analog interfaces, only YPBPR and analog RGB component video are capable of carrying non-interlaced video and resolutions higher than 480i or 576i, up to 1080p for YPBPR.

<text>Swansea is a ghost town in La Paz County in the U.S. state of Arizona. It was settled &quot;circa&quot; 1909 in what was then the Arizona Territory. It served as a mining town as well as a location for processing and smelting the copper ore taken from the nearby mines.

==History==
Prospecting and mining in the area first began &quot;circa&quot; 1862, but the remote location and lack of transportation kept activity to a minimum. By 1904, the railroad was coming to nearby Parker, and local miners Newton Evans and Thomas Jefferson Carrigan saw an opportunity to develop the area. Within a few years, the two miners had built a 350-ton furnace, a water pipeline to the Bill Williams River, and hoists for five mine shafts. They called the new town Signal (not to be confused with the other Arizona ghost town of Signal). By 1908, the claims in the area had been consolidated by the Clara Gold and Copper Mining Company, which set up its headquarters in the mining camp that would become Swansea. That same year, what was to become the Arizona and Swansea Railroad connected Signal to Bouse, some away. These two factors spurred the growth of the town, and its population quickly grew to approximately 300 residents.

When mining operations first began, the lack of smelting facilities meant that the copper ore had to be sent away for smelting. The destination for most of the ore was [[Swansea], [[United Kingdom]] and it was sent by way of railroad to the [[Colorado River]], and was then shipped from the [[Gulf of California]] around [[Cape Horn]] to the United Kingdom. Once a smelter was constructed in 1909, Signal took its new name from the previous location of the smelter they had used in Wales. As such, the destination of the ore sent for smelting remained the same. When the post office was established on March 25, 1909, it was under the name of Swansea.

At its peak, Swansea boasted an [[electric light]] company, an auto dealer, a lumber company, two cemeteries, a [[Western saloon|saloon]], theaters, restaurants, barbershops, an insurance agent, a physician, and of course the local mining and smelting facilities.

===Decline===
The town was short-lived. By 1911, the Clara Consolidated Gold and Copper Mining Company was in financial trouble. The company&#x27;s promoter in Swansea, George Mitchell, spent considerable sums of money on improvements aimed at attracting investors at the expense of practical improvements to the process of mining, hauling, and processing ore. As a result, the high cost of improvements coupled with the high cost of production meant that the mines could not turn a profit as the per-pound cost of copper production exceeded its price by three cents. The company collapsed in 1912, closing down the mines.

After a false start later that year under a new owner, the mines and the town remained quiet until the [[American Smelting and Refining Company]] bought the properties in 1914. The new owners restarted mining operations and once again built up the town. Swansea lived on until just after [[World War I]] when copper prices dropped, and the town went into a steep decline. Swansea&#x27;s post office was discontinued on June 28, 1924, and the population dispersed. By 1937, the mines shut down, and Swansea was already a ghost town.

==Remnants==
Today Swansea is under the protection of the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and constitutes the Swansea Town Site Special Management Area. Due to vandalism and exposure to the weather, the remains of Swansea are in decline. However, you can still see a number of adobe structures, the remains of the railroad depot, two cemeteries, and several mine shafts. Remains of numerous cars can be seen scattered throughout the site. The Bureau of Land Management has restored roofs to rows of single-miner&#x27;s quarters, established an interpretive trail for visitors to Swansea, and is engaged in efforts to shore up other structures. In addition, there are many stone foundations where buildings once stood.

==Geography==

Swansea is located approximately northeast of both Bouse and the town of [[Parker, Arizona|Parker]] at (34.1700198, -113.8460490). The site is remote, and is only accessible via rough, gravel roads.

==Demographics==
[[US Census]] data placed the population of the town at 400 in 1910 shortly after it was founded, and 337 in 1920, shortly before it was abandoned. By some accounts, the town&#x27;s population peaked at about 750 residents, though the rapid rise and fall of the town coupled with the timing of the collection of population data make that figure difficult to substantiate.

==Popular culture==

* The training scenes in the 1971 film &quot;[[The Day of the Wolves]]&quot; were shot in Swansea.

<doc id="826552" wikidata="Q174520" url="?curid=826552" title="Rose window">
<text>Rose window is often used as a generic term applied to a circular window, but is especially used for those found in Gothic cathedrals and churches. The windows are divided into segments by stone mullions and tracery. The term &quot;rose window&quot; was not used before the 17th century and comes from the English flower name rose.

The name &quot;wheel window&quot; is often applied to a window divided by simple spokes radiating from a central boss or opening, while the term &quot;rose window&quot; is reserved for those windows, sometimes of a highly complex design, which can be seen to bear similarity to a multi-petalled rose. Rose windows are also called &quot;Catherine windows&quot; after Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who was sentenced to be executed on a spiked breaking wheel. A circular window without tracery such as are found in many Italian churches, is referred to as an ocular window or oculus.

Rose windows are particularly characteristic of Gothic architecture and may be seen in all the major Gothic cathedrals of Northern France. Their origins are much earlier than Gothic architecture, however, and rose windows may be seen in various forms throughout the Medieval period. Their popularity was revived, with other medieval features, during the Gothic revival of the 19th century, so that they are seen in Christian churches all over the world.

== Style ==
*Oculi: These could be open or blind, could be glazed or filled with thin alabaster. During the late Gothic period very large ocular windows were common in Italy, being used in preference to traceried windows and being filled with elaborate pictures in stained glass designed by the most accomplished Late Medieval and Early Renaissance designers including Duccio, Donatello, Uccello and Ghiberti.
*Wheel Windows: These windows had a simple tracery of spokes radiating either from a central boss or from a central roundel. Popular during the Romanesque period and Gothic Italy, they are found across Europe but particularly Germany and Italy. They also occur in Romanesque Revival buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries.
*Plate Tracery: Rose windows with pierced openings rather than tracery occur in the transition between Romanesque and Gothic, particularly in France and most notably at Chartres. The most notable example in England is the north transept window, known as the &quot;Dean&#x27;s Eye&quot; in Lincoln Cathedral. These windows are occasionally found in 19th-century Revival buildings.
*Early Gothic: Rose windows with tracery comprising overlapping arcs like flower petals, circular and square shapes. This form occurs in Northern France, notably at Laon Cathedral, Italy and England. This style of window is popular in Gothic Revival architecture for the similarity that it has to a flower and is also utilised with specific reference to Our Lady of the Rosary.
*Rayonnant Gothic: The rose windows are divided by mullions radiating from a central roundel, overlapping in a complex design, each light terminating in a pointed arch and often interspersed with quatrefoils and other such shapes. Many of the largest rose windows in France are of this type, notably those at Paris and in the transepts of St Denis. An example in England is that in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. This style occurs widely in Gothic churches and is also widely imitated in Gothic Revival buildings.
*Flamboyant Gothic: The style is marked by S-curves in the tracery causing each light to take on a flamelike or &quot;flamboyant&quot; shape. Many windows are composed of fairly regularly shaped lights the richness of design dependent on the multiplicity of parts. Good examples are at Beauvais Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle, Paris. Some Late Gothic rose windows are of immense complexity of design, often using elements of the Gothic style in unexpected ways. A magnificent example is that of the façade of Amiens Cathedral. Although the design usually radiates from a central point, it may not be symmetrical about each axis. This may be seen in the Flamboyant Decorated Gothic window called the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Eye&quot; at Lincoln Cathedral in which the design takes the form of two ears of wheat.
*Renaissance: The Renaissance made a break with the Gothic style, and a return to the Classical. Plain untraceried oculi were sometimes employed, either in Classical pediments or around domes as at the Pazzi Chapel, Florence.
*Baroque: The Baroque style saw much greater use of ocular windows, which were not always circular, but frequently oval or of a more complex shape. They were untraceried or crossed by mullions of very simple form but were often surrounded by ornate carving. The purpose of such windows was the subtle illumination of interior spaces, without resorting to large windows offering external visibility. They rarely form a dominant visual element to either the façade or the interior as do the great Gothic windows. However, there are some notable exceptions, in particular the glorious burst of light which pours through the oval alabaster window depicting the Holy Spirit in the Reredos behind the High Altar of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Rome.
*Modern: Modern circular windows, which are most frequently of a simple ocular type, have an eclectic range of influences which includes abstract art, ship&#x27;s portholes and the unglazed circular openings of Oriental architecture.

== History ==

=== Origin ===

The origin of the rose window may be found in the Roman oculus. These large circular openings let in both light and air, the best known being that at the top of the dome of the Pantheon. Geometrical patterns similar to those in rose windows occur in Roman mosaics. 

The German art historian Otto von Simson considered that the origin of the rose window lay in a window with the six-lobed rosettes and octagon which adorned the external wall of the Umayyad palace Khirbat al-Mafjar built in Jordan between 740 and 750 CE. This theory suggests that crusaders brought the design of this attractive window to Europe, introducing it to churches. But the decorative pattern for rose and, independently, the tracery, are very present in vestiges of the early Christian architecture, Byzantine architecture, and especially in Merovingian art, and Visigothic architecture before the Muslim conquest of Spain. But half roses are also known, as with the church of San Juan Bautista in Baños de Cerrato. The scarcity and the brittleness of the vestiges of this time does not make it possible to say that complete rose window in tracery did not exist in early Middle Ages.

In Early Christian and Byzantine architecture, there are examples of the use of circular oculi. They usually occur either around the drum of a dome, as at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem, or high in the end of a gable of low-pitched Classical pediment form, as at Sant&#x27;Agnese fuori le mura, Rome, and Torcello Cathedral.

A window of the 8th century, now in Venice, and carved from a single slab, has alternating tracery-like components of two tiers of four &quot;lancets&quot; separated by three oculi. Many semicircular windows with pierced tracery exist from the 6th to the 8th century, and later in Greece.

Small circular windows such as that at S. Agnese and Torcello as well as unglazed decorative circular recesses continued to be used in churches in Italy, gaining increasing popularity in the later Romanesque period.

=== The windows of Oviedo ===
In the vicinity of Oviedo in Spain are several churches of the late 9th and early 10th century which display a remarkable array of windows containing the earliest examples of roses windows outside the Byzantine Empire. The designs closely resemble the motifs found on the Byzantine relief carvings of marble sarcophagi, pulpits and well heads and pierced decorations of screens and windows of Ravenna and Constantinople. The church of San Pedro de Nora has at its apsidal end a trio of rectangular windows with pierced decoration of two overlapping circles, the upper containing a Greek cross, the window being divided by the circles and the arms of the cross into numerous sections like tracery &quot;lights&quot;.

In another of these churches, San Miguel de Lillo, is the earliest known example of an axially placed oculus with tracery. Several such windows of different sizes exist, and decoration of both Greek Cross and scalloped petal-like form occur, prefiguring both wheel and rose windows.

=== Romanesque Circular windows ===
Circular windows and decorative circular recesses are a feature of many Romanesque churches and cathedrals, particularly in Germany and Italy where the style existed for a prolonged period, overlapping the development of Gothic in France and its arrival with French architects in England.

In Germany, Worms Cathedral, has wheel windows in the pedimental ends of its nave and gables, very similar to the Early Christian Basilica of S. Agnese in Rome. The apsidal western end has a central wheel window with smaller oculi in each face. The Church of the Apostles, Cologne has an array of both ocular and lobed windows forming decorative features in the gables and beneath the Rhenish helm spire. The octagonal dome has a ring of oculi with two in each of the curved faces. 

In Třebíč, Czech Republic, is the 12th- and 13th-century Romanesque style Basilica of St Procopius with apsidal windows similar to those at Worms, but in this case the openings are filled with tracery of a Gothic form, clearly marking the transition to a new style.

In Italy, the use of circular motifs in various media was a feature of church facades, occurring on Early Christian, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque churches, a well-known example being those great circles in polychrome marble which complement the central circular window on Alberti&#x27;s Early Renaissance façade at Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Oculi were also typically used in the drums supporting domes and as upper lights in octagonal baptisteries such as that at Cremona.

Romanesque facades with oculi include San Miniato al Monte, Florence, 11th century, San Michele, Pavia, c. 1117, and Pistoia Cathedral, 1150. As the windows increased in size in the later Romanesque period, wheel windows became a standard feature of which there are fine examples at San Zeno Maggiore, Verona and Monza Cathedral.

On the Romanesque façade of Spoleto Cathedral there is a profusion of recessed and traceried oculi surrounding the central features of a rose window set within a square beneath a large mosaic of 1207.

In England there exist five Romanesque wheel windows, notably those at Barfreston and Castle Hedingham parish churches.

=== St Denis, Chartres, Mantes, Laon and Paris ===


The transition from the Romanesque style to the Gothic was not clear cut, even at the Abbey of St Denis, to the north of Paris, where the Abbot Suger, between 1130 and 1144, gathered the various newly emerging features of Gothic into a single building, thereby “creating” the Gothic style.

Suger&#x27;s original rose window in the prototype Gothic façade of St Denis probably pre-dates many of the remaining circular windows in Romanesque buildings such as those in England, at Trebic and Spoleto and that in the façade at Speyer.

Suger&#x27;s window was not distinctively Gothic in its appearance. It no longer has its original form, but a mid-19th-century drawing by the restorer Viollet-le-Duc indicates that it had a very large ocular space at the centre, the glass supported by an iron hoop, and surrounded by simple semicircular lobes cut out of flat stone in a technique known as &quot;plate tracery&quot;. The window now has Gothic tracery in it, possibly added by Viollet-le-Duc who was very concerned about the lack of stability of the whole façade, and having restored the towers, was impelled to demolish the northern one when it suddenly subsided.

Along with the simple wheel windows of the late Norman period in England, Germany and Italy, a large late 12th-century window still exists at Chartres Cathedral. This remarkable window combines a large roundel at the centre with the radiating spokes of a wheel window, surrounded by a ring of smaller “plate tracery” lights with scalloped borders. The window, depicting the Last Judgement, contains its original scheme of glazing and retains much of the original glass of 1215, despite suffering damage during World War II.

Following the west window of Chartres, more daring Gothic windows were created at the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame in Mantes and in the dynamically sculptural facade of Laon Cathedral (which also, unusually, has a rose window in its eastern end as well as in it transept ends). These windows have large lights contained in tracery of a semicircular form, like overlapping petals.

The window that is central to the well-known Gothic façade of Notre Dame, Paris, is of more distinctly Gothic appearance, with mullions in two bands radiating from a central roundel, each terminating in pointed arches. It was this window, completed about 1255, that set the pattern for many other rose window including those of the transepts at St Denis and the gigantic and complex window in the south transept at Notre Dame.

At Chartres, the transepts roses follow the style of the original 12th-century rose, elaborating on the theme of contrasting forms. The south rose combines the wheel with circles and semicircles, while the north rose introduces square lights which, rotating around the centre, are all set at different angles, creating a kaleidoscopic effect of great energy.

=== Further development ===
From the building of Chartres the dimensions of the rose window began to increase with the development of more elaborate window styles associated with Gothic architecture. By the middle of the 13th century the rose had attained the greatest possible size – the entire width of the nave or transept, as seen in the transept roses at St Denis and Paris.

In the facades of St Denis, Chartres, Mantes, Laon and Paris, the rose was put under a circular arch. The next important development in its use for the Gothic style was to put it under a pointed arch, as was done in the Notre-Dame de Reims (after 1241), in the transepts as well as in the later roses of the facade. This form probably stemmed from the now destroyed St Nicaise, also in Reims.

The rose window was often placed above a row of vertical lights as the apex of the composition, the small corner &quot;spandrels&quot; between the rose and lower tier being filled by smaller lights of rose form, as in the transepts of St Denis and Notre Dame.

The last step in evolution of the Gothic style was to set the rose into a tier of vertical lights, of staggered height and surmount it by a tapering pointed light so that it became the centre of a vast window composition, covering the whole end of the transepts, as in Rouen or Beauvais Cathedrals. This sort of elaborate composition can also be seen at the east end of Milan Cathedral.

Rose windows were also set into square windows, the spandrels being pierced and filled with smaller lights as at Paris, 1257, or unpierced with sculpture, the form more common in Italy as at Spoleto and also seen in the north transept of Westminster Abbey and at Strasbourg Cathedral, (see pictured above).

=== Regional examples ===
====Australia====
A number of Australia&#x27;s cathedrals have Gothic Revival rose windows including three by William Wardell at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney and another at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne which form the upper part of a very large seven-light window in the west end.

====Ecuador====
Two examples of rose windows are found in the National Basilica, built in 1893 and in the Santa Teresa Church, built in 1934. The cathedral in Cuenca, in the southern Andes, has a notable rose window.
====England====
In England, the use of the rose window was commonly confined to the transepts although roses of great span were constructed in the west front of Byland Abbey and in the east front of Old St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

The cathedrals of York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Oxford feature medieval rose windows.

Medieval Beverley Minster has an example of an Early Gothic wheel window with ten spokes, each light terminating in a cusped trefoils and surrounded by decorative plate tracery.

Later windows are to be seen at the nondenominational Abney Park Chapel in London designed in 1838–40 by William Hosking FSA; Holy Trinity Church, Barnes, London; St Nicholas, Richmond; and St Albans Cathedral by George Gilbert Scott.

At Christ Church Appleton-le-Moors, Yorkshire, the 19th-century architect J.L.Pearson appears to have taken as his inspiration the regional floral symbol of the white rose. This unusual plate-tracery window dating from the 1860s has been designed with five double sections like the two-part petals of a simple rose.

The largest rose window in England is believed to be that installed in the chapel of Lancing College in 1978, with a diameter of 32 feet.

====France====
France has a great number of medieval rose windows, many containing ancient glass. In northern France, a rose window is usually the central feature of the facade. The transept facades commonly contain rose windows as well. Examples can be seen at Notre Dame, Paris (see left), the Basilica of Saint Denis (see left), Chartres Cathedral (see above), Reims Cathedral, Amiens Cathedral and Strasbourg Cathedral (see introductory pictures.)

====Italy====

In Italy, the rose window was particularly used by the Lombard architects, as in San Zeno in Verona, and in the Cathedral of Modena, and in the Tuscan Gothic churches like the Cathedrals of Siena and Orvieto.
An outstanding example of a rose window is the thirteen-spoked centrepiece of the Minor Basilica in Larino, Molise (1312). Others are the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi and Santa Maria di Collemaggio (1289) in L&#x27;Aquila.

====United States====
First United Methodist Church in Lubbock, Texas, houses one of the largest rose windows at in diameter.
A Baroque oculus without tracery or stained glass can be seen at San Jose Mission in San Antonio, Texas, which was founded by the Franciscan Fathers and dates from 1718 to 1731.

The largest rose window in the United States is &quot;The Great Rose Window&quot; above the main doors of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. It is designed in the Gothic Revival style and made from more than 10,000 pieces of stained glass.

Washington National Cathedral has three large rose windows which represent the Creation, Last Judgement, and Glory of God.

In 1954, the French artist Henri Matisse created the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Memorial Rose Window on the east wall of the Union Church of Pocantico Hills, New York.
== Symbolism ==
In Gothic cathedrals and churches, where a rose is often found above the West Door, the most common subject of the stained glass that it contains is the Last Judgement, which by a long tradition is depicted either in mural or glass on the western wall of the building. In such windows Christ is shown seated in the centre &quot;light&quot; and within the lights around him are the symbols of the four Gospel writers, Apostles, Prophets, Saints and Angels. Some windows show God&#x27;s dominion over Heaven and Earth by including Zodiacal signs and Labours of the Months.

When rose windows are used in the transept ends, then one of those windows is frequently dedicated to Mary as the Mother of Jesus. In modern Catholic thought, the rose window is often associated with the Virgin Mary because one of her titles, referred to by St Bernard of Clairvaux, is the &quot;Mystical Rose&quot;. However, the specific association of Mary with the rose window is unlikely during the Medieval period, because the term &quot;rose window&quot; was not coined until the 17th century, a time when few such windows were being constructed. However, with the revival of the Gothic style in the 19th and 20th centuries, much stained glass that was installed in rose windows, both in new churches and as restoration in old churches, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

== Timeline ==

** Often used in France and Italy at this time.
** Roughly only 6 feet in diameter.
** Some were elaborately decorated with carved ornament and symbols of the Evangelist. Also it was common for them to be decorated with images of lions, bulls, eagles, and angels. With that being said, most had little-to-no decoration.
** The most important identifying thing about the oculi style was that a technically, in the traditional sense, wasn&#x27;t a window. This was due to the fact that, there was no glass separating the inside of the building from the outside. Sometimes they would have metal grate bars in them.
** The belief of the purpose and use, was to have natural light within the structures.
** Example(s):
*** Chapel of Burj Heidar (298 A.D.)
*** Church of the Holy Sepulchre (335 A.D.)

=== Byzantine (330–1453 A.D.) ===
* Oculi style
** Example(s):
*** Saint-Généroux (950 A.D.)
**** Created later in the Byzantine period, it was heavily influenced by the Romanesque period that was just about to flourish.
* Other speculation of its origins, is that it comes from the six-lobed rosettes and octagon, that decorate Hisham&#x27;s Palace (Built 740–750 A.D.)
* In 848, the earliest known example of an axially placed oculus with tracery became San Miguel de Lillo.
* During the 6th–8th century, semicircular windows were thought to have existed.
* In Spain, the Oviedo vicinity, has some of the earliest examples of rose windows outside of the Byzantine Empire. (9th – early 10th century)

=== Romanesque (1000–1150 A.D.) ===
* Oculi style
** Example(s):
*** Cefalù Cathedral (12th century A.D.)
* Small circular windows were common, and very popular of this period.
** The reason for this, was the poor architectural advancements at the time. At this point, the heavy stone material that was favored could only support small windows.
* Many speculate that the rose window came from the Wheel a Fortune from the northern facade of a, Saint-Étienne, Beauvais in 1072.
* Wheel window style
** The wheel window style refers to when architects started to putting glass within the oculi structure creating an actual window. This was due to when architects tried increasing the diameter of the oculi to let in more light, the problem of wind and rain became very apparent.
** They became the standard for the rose window, becoming the base of which other styles that would be created.
** Example(s):
*** Worms Cathedral (1110 A.D.)
*** Saint-Etienna, Beauvais (1150 A.D.)
*** Castle Hedingham churches
* Plate tracery style
** “Tracery” refers to the pattern within the window itself. Over the course of time tracery will evolve and change into three different distinct patterns: geometric, flower, and flame.
** “Plate” refers to a technique that came about in the 5th and 6th century in Syria, where when carving designs, an artist would take a single flat slab or piece of stone and carve one complete design with it.
** Example(s):
*** Strasbourg Cathedral (1015–1439 A.D.)
* Consider to be the first Gothic church, the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, was completed in 1144 A.D, as the Gothic period was beginning. It also is the first known church to have stained glass rose windows around 1200 A.D.
* The first rose windows that used dividing pieces and adornments first appeared basically at the same time in Italy at San Zeno at Verona, in Tuscany and in France at Saint-Denis and Saint-Etienne at Beauvais. At this time it was just as much of a useful structure tailored for interior drama as it was for exterior decoration.
* Rose windows gained major popularity in the middle of the 12th century.

===Early Gothic (around 1150–1250 A.D.)===
* The Gothic period is considered to be the birthplace of the “true” traditional rose window.
* Plate tracery style
** Example(s):
*** Notre-Dame de Paris (1163–1345 A.D.)
**** Notre-Dame was considered a great architectural accomplishment in many ways including the rose window. The west rose window is nearly 33 ft in diameter with a spider web like frame for great support. It also has one of the highest ratio of glass and stone of any other rose window.
**** In 1225 Notre-Dame began modifications on its fourth story, instead of a triforium there were rose-shaped oculi which projected light onto the roof.
*** The Collegiate Church of Mantes which was similar in design but smaller in scale also used oculi windows for lighting.
*** Lincoln Cathedral (1185–1311 A.D.)
* Around the Gothic period the style of window, took a turn from the “wheel” like shape to a more complex flowering shape.
* Although, it cannot be known for sure when the rose window got its name, the naming of the window is thought to have occurred around the early 13th century.
* It is believed that the increase in popularity of the Virgin Mary is linked to the rose windows getting their name and gaining favor as well.
* A product already have been invented in the Middle Ages, stained glass only had appeared in the rose window at the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis. However, it started to become more popular around the earlier part of the 1200s, often the money for the glass, being donated by the wealthy.
** The glass had a tenancy to be dark and rich with color.
** The most common color combination was blue and red color patterns.
* Bar tracery style 
** Bar tracery allowed for more glass to be used in the windows, creating a more visually stunning piece of artwork.
** In 1211, Reims Cathedral became known for being the first Gothic cathedral to use bar tracery with rose windows. 
* Besides, showing up later in Rhenish art around 1200, the circular window was almost never used in Romanesque architecture and never considered to be important for lighting.
* Early Gothic style
** Example(s): 
*** Laon Cathedral (12th–13th centuries A.D.)
**** 1180–90 marked the date for the two transept large rose windows which were made up of several juxtaposed multi-foils. These stood out in particular for their importance in interior lighting.
**** Around 1205 the Laon Cathedral&#x27;s choir was upgraded to also house a large rose window which was subdivided by mullions (slender dividing bars). Along with some other tall windows this was considered one of the greatest examples of Gothic art from the early 13th century. 
* From the 12th until the early 13th century, The Last Judgement became a popular theme in rose windows.
* Rayonnant Gothic style
** This began the revolution of rose windows, in the sense that no Gothic church or cathedral, was complete without one. Rose Windows became a standard part of Gothic architecture. With the overwhelming desire to have rose windows everywhere, came the mixed reviews of craftsmanship and design, compared to the ones of previous eras. 
** The style is probably most known for its emphasis on more glass being shown in the rose windows.
* Curvilinear style
** Origin are from England.
** Compared to previous styles, the Curvilinear style is considered to be one of the more abstract, unconventional, design interpretations of the rose window.
** Example(s):
*** Boyton in Wiltshire (13th century A.D.)
* Flamboyant Gothic style
** The name refers to the flame like form and design within the patterned tracery.
** Example(s):
*** Sainte-Chapelle (1242–1248 A.D.)
*** Sens Cathedral (1490)
**** One of the most exquisite examples of flamboyant style mastered by Martin Chambige.
*** Beauvais Cathedral (1500)
**** Also created by Chambiege and while it is visually spectacular it is not executed as well.

=== High Gothic (around 1250–1375 A.D.)===
* First started in France and around 1260, spread across Europe. The Gothic period was considered to be a &quot;golden age&quot; of architecture.
* There are many things that cause the rose window to spread so rapidly across Europe, such as...
** The increase in the authority of religion. 
** The growth of the economy at the time.
* The designing of the intricate framework of the rose windows had two basic principles of design during this period:
** Ad Quadratum
** &quot;Right Measure&quot; or &quot;Two to One&quot;
* The use of voids in the geometrical designing a rose windows is a defining difference between Rayonnant and Famboyant styles.
* Practically every rose window contains at least one star. The star can be literal or it can be implied in the design work.
* The tree of Jesus was a popular theme in rose windows through the 12th–13th centuries.
* Curvilinear style
* Plate tracery style
* Bar tracery style
* Rayonnant Gothic style
** Example(s): 
*** Notre-Dame de Paris (1163–1345 A.D.)
* Flamboyant Gothic style
** Example(s):
*** Lincoln Cathedral (1185–1311 A.D.)
*** Beauvais Cathedral (1272 A.D.)
*** Amiens Cathedral (13th century A.D.)

=== International Gothic (around 1375–1450 A.D.)===
* Stained glass at this point in time was beginning to be much more painterly. 
** To create a lighter and area feel, colors such as yellows and greens were often used.
* Plate tracery style
* Bar tracery style
* Rayonnant Gothic style
* Flamboyant Gothic style

===Early and High Renaissance (around 1400–1550 A.D.)===
* This period is marked by the increase in longitude storytelling with narrative images.
* Although, later many were removed in the 19th century, the zodiac symbol also became a recurring design element in rose windows at this time.
* Oculi style
** Example(s):
*** Pazzi Chapel (1429–1443 A.D.)
* Renaissance style
** This began the break of the Gothic style and instead started the renewal of the Classical art style.
** A defining characteristic about the Renaissance style is the use of ferramenta instead of stone tracery.
** Creating abstract figures within rose windows was particularly prevalent at this time.
** Example(s):
*** Seville Cathedral (1536 A.D.)
* Plate tracery style
* Bar tracery style
* Rayonnant Gothic style

===Baroque (1600–1725 A.D.)===
* Baroque style
** Common with this style, was the use of circular, oval, and organic complex shapes; not just circular shapes.

=== Neoclassical (1760–1830 A.D.)===
* Oculi style

===The Revival (mid-19th–20th centuries A.D.)===
* This was a time of restoring, recreating, and creating cathedrals, inspired by older designs.
* This phenomenon spread across Europe being particularly prevalent in Britain, France, and Germany.
* Plate Tracery style
* Bar Tracery style
* Wheel Window style
* Flamboyant Gothic style
* Renaissance style
* Rayonnant Gothic style
** Rose pattern tracery was very popular.

===Modern (1860–1970s A.D.)===
* It is speculated that the Modern period of rose windows is a continuation of the Revival period previous.
* Modern style
** The rose design itself would often be interpreted very abstractly with stained glass as well as new types of glass such as dalle de verre.

<text>Breitling SA () is a Swiss luxury watchmaker founded in 1884 in Saint-Imier, Switzerland, by Léon Breitling. The company is known for its precision-made chronometers designed for aviators and is based in Grenchen, Switzerland. The company is currently owned by Partners Group.

==History==

Breitling SA was founded in Saint-Imier by Léon Breitling in 1884. When Breitling died in 1914, the business passed to his son, Gaston, and then to his grandson, Willy, in 1935. Willy&#x27;s children, however, were not interested in pursuing the family business, so the Breitling factory in La Chaux de Fonds closed in December 1978. Willy, already in poor health, died in May 1979.

Ernst Schneider bought the Breitling name from the founding family in 1979. Schneider was owner of the Sicura Company in Grenchen. Production of Breitling watches moved to the Sicura factory, which later changed its name to &quot;Montres Breitling AG&quot; and then to &quot;Breitling AG&quot; in 1994.

The Schneider family retained ownership until April 2017, when Ernst&#x27;s son, Theodore Schneider, sold the majority stake (80%) in Breitling to CVC Capital Partners for $870 million. Schneider retained 20% control of Breitling until November 2018, when he sold these remaining 20% to CVC.

On 23 December 2022, Partners Group, a Swiss investment and private equity firm, took over the majority of the Breitling shares from CVC. Co-founder of Partners Group, Alfred Gantner, took over the presidency of Breitling&#x27;s directorial board.

==Products==
The company&#x27;s mechanical or quartz movements are chronometer certified by the COSC and are usually marketed towards either diving (SuperOcean) or aviation (Navitimer). Aviation models offer aviation functions largely as complications, since their function in aviation has largely been replaced by modern electronic instruments. The styling of Breitling watches consists of polished cases, bracelets, and large watch faces for improved readability. Many models have an automatic winding mechanism with complications.

Breitling offers logo customization for pilots with group orders. By the 1990s, the use of logos for military aviation customers expanded to include various unit logos on the Aerospace and Chronospace Auto models, primarily those of squadrons, usually part of a group purchase by pilots and navigators/flight officers of the particular unit.

Historically, Breitling has sourced movements from suppliers such as Valjoux, ETA, and Venus rather than producing movements in-house; however, in 2009 Breitling developed the B01, a self-winding, column wheel chronograph movement, for use in the Breitling Chronomat 01 and Navitimer 01.

=== Top Time ===
=== Navitimer ===
In the 1940s, Breitling added a circular slide rule to the bezel of its Chronomat models. This bezel became most associated with the Navitimer, launched in 1954. The name &quot;Navitimer&quot; comes from two words were used to describe its purpose: Navigation and Timer. During the 1950s and 1960s, a version of the Navitimer was offered by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association with the AOPA logo on the dial.

In 1961, Scott Carpenter, one of the original astronauts in the Mercury space program, tasked Breitling with incorporating a 24-hour dial instead of the normal 12-hour dial, due to lack of day and night in space travel. Breitling produced the 24-hour Navitimer, which Carpenter wore on his 1962 space flight. Breitling proceeded to produce a commercial version of the 24-hour version, the &quot;Cosmonaute Navitimer&quot;, with both Breitling and AOPA logos.

The first automatic Navitimer chronograph was introduced to the public in 1969; its movement was co-developed by Breitling, Dubois-Depraz, Heuer, and Hamilton.

=== Chronomat ===

The &quot;Chronomat&quot; is a collection from Breitling released in 1942, and remains one of the best-selling models produced by the manufacturer.

The first Chronomat had a circular slide rule and its design was inspired by military watches. Its movement was the Venus 175 with 17 jewels, a manual wind movement.

The current Chronomat was released in 2009 and was the first watch produced entirely by Breitling, featuring the in-house B01 caliber. The B01 movement has a 70-hour power reserve and COSC certification.

===Emergency===

The &quot;Breitling Emergency&quot; watch contains a radio transmitter for civil aviation use, which broadcasts on the 121.5 MHz distress frequency and serves as a backup for ELT-type airborne beacons. For military users, the Emergency has a miniaturized transmitter operating on the 243.0 MHz military aviation emergency frequency. Under normal conditions—flat terrain or calm seas—the signal can be picked up at a range of up to by search aircraft flying at . Since February 2009, the Cospas-Sarsat Satellite System has not monitored the 121.5/243.0 MHz frequency; however, the signal transmitted by the Emergency was never strong enough to be picked up by satellite, and Breitling has announced that, as these frequencies will still be monitored by aviation, particularly during the localization phase of a rescue attempt, there are no plans to modify the signal&#x27;s frequency.

&quot;Reuters&quot; reported in January 2003 two British pilots, Squadron Leader Steve Brooks and Flight Lieutenant Hugh Quentin-Smith, crashed their helicopter in Antarctica and were rescued after activating their Breitling Emergency transmitter watches.

The Emergency is available for customers without a pilot&#x27;s license, but they must sign an agreement that they will bear the full costs of a rescue intervention should they trigger the distress beacon.

The model was heavily advertised by the &quot;Breitling Orbiter 3&quot;, with both Brian Jones and Bertrand Piccard wearing the Emergency. Breitling sponsored the Orbiter 3 project, which in 1999 became the first balloon to completely orbit the Earth without landing. A commemorative Orbiter 3 version of the Emergency watch was subsequently produced, with a production run of 1,999.

===Emergency II===
In April 2013, Breitling announced a new version of the Emergency watch. This upgrade transmits on the 121.5 MHz frequency, but adds the 406.04 MHz signal that is monitored by satellites. It has a separate, rechargeable battery for the transmitter.

===Breitling for Bentley===
In 2002, Breitling designed the dashboard clock for the Bentley Continental GT. The following year, Breitling started making chronographs for Bentley Motors. As part of the 10th anniversary of a Breitling–Bentley partnership, the Bentley B04 GMT, B05 Unitime and B06 (based on COSC Certified Breitling Calibre B04, B05 and B06 respectively) were produced. In 2015, Breitling designed the Mulliner Tourbillon dashboard clock for the Bentley Bentayga, which spins 3 times every 15 minutes. The partnership between Breitling and Bentley ended in 2021.

==Versions==
==Sponsorship==
Breitling aeronautical sponsorships include the first circumnavigation of the globe by balloon (Breitling Orbiter); the fixed-wing jet pack flights of Yves Rossy; aerobatics teams, including the Breitling Jet Team and Breitling Wingwalkers; and the Reno Air Races from 2002 to 2015. Breitling was a sponsor of Team Bentley during its Le Mans 24 Hours campaign, from 2001 to 2003; to commemorate this, it created the Breitling-Bentley 24 Le Mans Watch.

==Key Milestones and Innovations==

1915: Breitling introduced one of the first wrist-worn chronographs, featuring a separate pusher for the chronograph function.

1934: They revolutionized chronographs by adding a second pusher, allowing for resetting without stopping the watch.

1939: Breitling partnered with the British Royal Air Force (RAF) to provide onboard chronographs. This collaboration marked the beginning of Breitling&#x27;s long standing relationship with aviation and military forces. 

1952: The iconic Breitling Navitimer was launched, equipped with a circular slide rule for aviation calculations.

1962: Astronaut Scott Carpenter wore a specially modified Breitling Navitimer Cosmonaute on the Mercury Atlas 7 mission, making it the first Swiss wristwatch worn in space. The watch had a customised 24-hour dial to help Carpenter distinguish between day and night while orbiting Earth.

1969: Breitling played a key role in developing the Chrono-Matic, one of the first automatic chronograph movements.

1984: The Breitling Chronomat was reintroduced, becoming a flagship model with its robust design and tachymeter scale.

1995: The Breitling Emergency watch debuted, featuring a built-in distress beacon for aviation professionals.

1999: Became the first Swiss watchmaker to have all its timepieces (mechanical and quartz) certified as chronometers.

2001: Breitling released SuperQuartz™ technology. At the time of its release it was one of the most accurate quartz movements available. SuperQuartz™ movements are thermocompensated, meaning they adjust for temperature fluctuations. This enhances their accuracy and as a result they are 10 times more accurate than standard quartz movements, with an annual variation of only 15 seconds. 

2002: Breitling and Bentley Motors started one of the longest standing partnerships between a Swiss watchmaker and a luxury car manufacturer. The partnership began in 2002 when Bentley was designing the iconic Bentley Continental GT, which featured a signature onboard Breitling clock. The partnership between the two great companies lasted for 19 years, ending in 2021. 

2003: The Avenger Seawolf was introduced designed using finite element analysis to optimise the design and durability providing the watch with 3,000m (10,000ft) water resistance one of deepest diving watches of the time. 

2004: The Avenger Seawolf Chronograph was first introduced. It was paired with a Breitling SuperQuartz™ movement due to having the worlds first magnetic pushers. The magnetic pushers allowed the chronograph to be operated at a depth of 1,000m (3,300ft) and upon release was the only chronograph capable of being operating at that depth.

2009: Breitling unveiled the B01 movement, its first in-house mechanical chronograph caliber.

2013: The Breitling Emergency 2 was released in 2013. Advantages over the original model: Dual-Frequency Transmitter to enhance the chances of being located in an emergency. Rechargeable Battery, Improved Antenna System and Extended Transmission Time. 

2015: The Exospace B55 was launched, a connected watch designed for pilots with smart features.

2016: Breitling developed and patented a high-tech material called Breitlight. Breitlight is renown for its exceptional durability, lightness and resistance to scratching, corrosion and thermal variation. It is also hypoallergenic and antimagnetic. It was first used in 2016 in the launch of the Avenger Hurricane. It has also been used in the Breitling Colt Skyracer (2017) and the Breitling Endurance Pro range originally released in 2020. 

2020: The Endurance Pro was introduced, a lightweight sports chronograph designed for athletes, featuring a thermo-compensated SuperQuartz™ movement.

==In popular culture==
In the 1965 James Bond movie &quot;Thunderball&quot;, Bond is given a Breitling Top Time, which contains a geiger counter, enabling Bond to track down two stolen nuclear warheads. After the movie was filmed, the watch disappeared and later resurfaced in a car boot sale in England in 2012, where it was purchased for . It later sold at Christie&#x27;s auction house for over . In the same film, the SPECTRE pilot who hijacks the Vulcan bomber wears a Breitling Navitimer.

Jerry Seinfeld can be seen wearing either a Breitling Navitimer or Breitling Chronomat in nearly every episode of 1989–1998 TV series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, and the later web series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;. In the British automotive series &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Richard Hammond uses a Breitling Emergency II watch to be rescued by Jeremy Clarkson and James May.

<text>Nicholas Agamalis, better known as Nick Skitz (born 1968 in Sydney, Australia), is an Australian DJ and dance music producer. His career in dance music started in the early 1990s. Since 1995, his &quot;Skitzmix&quot; series of compilations have become well known in Australian dance circles for featuring remixes and megamixes of well-known dance songs and are the best selling DJ compilations in Australia.

==Biography==
In 2004, he collaborated with Tony Le Rhodes, who is his brother Tony Agamalis. He was the ex-drummer for the &quot;Choirboys&quot;, which than linked up with Mark Gable, lead singer of Australian rock band The Choirboys to rework their 1987 Australian hit &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; as a dance track. The song, billed as &quot;Nick Skitz vs. the Choirboys&quot;, debuted in the top 20 of the Australian pop charts in July 2004, and was the 17th biggest selling dance single of that year.

In 2009 Central Station Records folded and Skitz started his own labels LNG Music and Homebrew Records.

July 2011 saw the release of &quot;Skitzmix 38&quot;, &quot;Skitzmix 39&quot; was released in November. In February 2012, &quot;Skitzmix 40&quot; was released. On 28 December 2012, the single &quot;Again &amp; Again&quot; (Nick Skitz and Basslouder featuring Brooklyn Bounce) was released.

<doc id="826564" wikidata="Q37508" url="?curid=826564" title="American Hairless Terrier">
<text>The American Hairless Terrier is a breed of companion dog from the United States that was developed from naturally hairless Rat Terriers.

==History==
In 1972, a completely hairless bitch pup was whelped in a litter of purebred Rat Terriers and adopted by Willie and Edwin Scott of Louisiana. Named Josephine, the bitch conformed to the Rat Terrier type in every way except for her coat, so the Scotts bred her. Her first litter produced another hairless bitch pup, Gypsy. Neither bitch whelped another hairless pup in multiple litters until, in 1981 at the age of nine, Josephine produced two more hairless pups, a dog and a bitch. In 1983 the dog, Snoopy, was mated to his hairless sisters and many more hairless pups were whelped, establishing the foundation stock for the new breed. Originally registered as a hairless variety of Rat Terriers, eventually the Scotts adopted a different breed name for their unique line and established a separate breed club, the American Hairless Terrier Association. In 2004 the United Kennel Club recognised the line as a breed and in 2016 the American Kennel Club also recognised the breed.

==Description==
According to the United Kennel Club&#x27;s breed standard, American Hairless Terriers typically stand between ; the breed typically weighs between . The breed has pricked ears and can be born with either a naturally short tail or a long tail, which is never docked.

At birth American Hairless Terriers are born with a light fuzz of hair over their entire body which they gradually shed from the nose backwards until they are entirely naked, though they sometimes retain eyebrows and whiskers. This typically occurs by the age of six weeks. The breed standard states the skin can be any color, although they are usually part colored with freckles that enlarge with age. Because of their lack of hair, the breed is particularly susceptible to hypothermia in cold weather and sunburn in sunny conditions.

Some American Hairless Terriers are born with coats; they are still recognised as examples of the breed. The breed standard states coated examples of the breed have a short and dense coat that can be solid white or bi-color, tri-color, sable and brindle, always with some white.

<doc id="826574" wikidata="Q835598" url="?curid=826574" title="Naming of moons">
<text>The naming of moons has been the responsibility of the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s committee for Planetary System Nomenclature since 1973. That committee is known today as the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN).

Prior to its formation, the names of satellites have had varying histories. The choice of names is often determined by a satellite&#x27;s discoverer; however, historically some satellites were not given names for many years after their discovery; for instance, Titan was discovered by Huygens in 1655, but was not named until 1847, almost two centuries later.

Before the IAU assumed responsibility for astronomical nomenclature, only twenty-five satellites had been given names that were in wide use and are still used: 1 of Earth, 2 of Mars, 5 of Jupiter, 10 of Saturn, 5 of Uranus, and 2 of Neptune. Since then, names have been given to 137 additional planetary and dwarf planetary satellites: 52 satellites of Jupiter, 53 of Saturn, 22 of Uranus, 12 of Neptune, 5 of Pluto, 2 of Haumea, and 1 each of , , , and . Names have also been given to some satellites of minor planets, including the dwarf planet candidates and which have one satellite each. The number will continue to rise as current satellite discoveries are documented and new satellites are discovered.

At the IAU General Assembly in July 2004, the WGPSN suggested it may become advisable to not name small satellites, as CCD technology makes it possible to discover satellites as small as 1 km in diameter. Until 2014, names were applied to all planetary moons discovered, regardless of size. From 2015, some small moons have not received names.

== Naming of moons by Solar System object ==

=== Earth ===

Every human language has its own word for the Earth&#x27;s Moon, and these words are the ones normally used in astronomical contexts. However, a number of fanciful or mythological names for the Moon have been used in the context of astronomy (an even larger number of lunar epithets have been used in non-astronomical contexts). In the 17th century, the Moon was sometimes referred to as &quot;Proserpina&quot;. More recently, especially in science-fiction content, the Moon has been called by the Latin name &quot;Luna&quot;, presumably on the analogy of the Latin names of the planets, or by association with the adjectival form &quot;lunar&quot;, or a need to differentiate it from other moons that may be present in a fictional setting. In technical terminology, the word-stems &quot;seleno-&quot; (from Greek &quot;selēnē&quot; &quot;moon&quot;) and &quot;cynthi-&quot; (from &quot;Cynthia&quot;, an epithet of the goddess Artemis) are sometimes used to refer to the Moon, as in &quot;selenography, selenology,&quot; and &quot;pericynthion.&quot;

=== Mars ===

The moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) were named by Asaph Hall in 1878, soon after he discovered them. They are named after the sons of the god Ares (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Mars).

=== Jupiter ===

The Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610. However, by the late 19th century these names had fallen out of favor, and for a long time it was most common to refer to them in the astronomical literature simply as &quot;Jupiter I&quot;, &quot;Jupiter II&quot;, etc., or as &quot;the first satellite of Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s second satellite&quot;, etc.

By the first decade of the 20th century, the names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto had once again recovered popularity, but the later-discovered moons, numbered, usually in Roman numerals V (5) through XII (12), remained unnamed. By a popular though unofficial convention, Jupiter V, discovered in 1892, was given the name &quot;Amalthea&quot;, first used by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion.

The other irregular satellites (discovered 1904 to 1951) were, in the overwhelming majority of astronomical literature, simply left nameless. No names were proposed until Brian G. Marsden suggested a nomenclature for these satellites in 1955. Although the 1955 names met with immediate acceptance in some quarters (e.g. in science fiction and popular science articles), they were still rarely if ever met in astronomical literature until the 1970s.

Two other proposals for naming the satellites were made between 1955 and 1975, both by Soviet astronomers, E. I. Nesterovich (in 1962) and Yu. A. Karpenko (in 1973). These met no particularly enthusiastic reception.

In 1975, following Charles Kowal&#x27;s discovery of the satellite Jupiter XIII in 1974, the IAU Task Group for Outer Solar System Nomenclature granted names to satellites V-XIII, and provided for a formal naming process for future satellites to be discovered. Under the new process, Jupiter V continued as Amalthea, Jupiter XIII was named Leda in accordance with a suggestion of Kowal&#x27;s, and all previous proposals for the seven satellites VI-XII were abandoned in favor of new names, in accordance with a scheme suggested by the German philologist Jürgen Blunck where prograde moons received names ending in &#x27;a&#x27; and retrograde moons received names ending in &#x27;e&#x27;.

The new names met considerable protest from some quarters. Kowal, despite suggesting a name for Jupiter XIII, was of the opinion that Jupiter&#x27;s irregular satellites should not be named at all. Carl Sagan noted that the names chosen were extraordinarily obscure (a fact that Tobias Owen, chair of the Task Group, admitted was intentional in a response to Sagan) and suggested his own names in 1976; these preserved some of the names from the 1955 proposal. Karpenko had noted the same in his 1981 book &quot;The Names of the Starry Sky&quot;, along with stating that the names chosen for retrograde moons, and therefore the &quot;e&quot; ending, were not always the ones for which it was the more common one.

The proposals are summarized in the table below (data from &quot;Icarus&quot; unless specified otherwise):

Current practice is that newly discovered moons of Jupiter must be named after lovers or descendants of the mythological Jupiter (Zeus). Blunck&#x27;s scheme for the outer moons was retained, with the addition that names ending in &#x27;o&#x27; could also be used for prograde moons. At the IAU General Assembly in July 2004, the WGPSN allowed Jovian satellites to be named for Zeus&#x27; descendants in addition to his lovers and favorites which were the previous source of names, due to the large number of new Jovian satellites that had then recently been discovered. All of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites from XXXIV (Euporie) on were named for descendants of Zeus, until Jupiter LIII (Dia), named after another one of his lovers.

=== Saturn ===

In 1847, the seven then known moons of Saturn were named by John Herschel. Herschel named Saturn&#x27;s two innermost moons (Mimas and Enceladus) after the mythological Greek Giants, and the outer five after the Titans (Titan, Iapetus) and Titanesses (Tethys, Dione, Rhea) of the same mythology. Until then, Titan was known as the &quot;Huygenian (or Huyghenian) satellite of Saturn&quot; and the other moons had Roman numeral designations in order of their distance from Saturn. Subsequent discoverers of Saturnian moons followed Herschel&#x27;s scheme: Hyperion was discovered soon after in 1848, and the ninth moon, Phoebe, was named by its discoverer in 1899 soon after its discovery; they were named for a Titan and a Titaness respectively. The name of Janus was suggested by its discoverer, Audouin Dollfus.

Current IAU practice for newly discovered inner moons is to continue with Herschel&#x27;s system, naming them after Titans or their descendants. However, the increasing number of moons that were being discovered in the 21st century caused the IAU to draw up a new scheme for the outer moons. At the IAU General Assembly in July 2004, the WGPSN allowed satellites of Saturn to have names of giants and monsters in mythologies other than the Greco-Roman. Since the outer moons fall naturally into three groups, one group is named after Norse giants, one after Gallic giants, and one after Inuit giants. The only moon that fails to fit this scheme is the Greek-named Phoebe, which is in the Norse group.

=== Uranus ===

The Roman numbering scheme of Uranus&#x27; moons was in a state of flux for a considerable time. Sir William Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons and maybe even a ring. For nearly fifty years, Herschel&#x27;s instrument was the only one the moons had been seen with. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favourable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Publications hesitated between William Herschel&#x27;s designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell&#x27;s (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck.

The first two Uranian moons, discovered in 1787, did not receive names until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god of the sky and air, would be attended by spirits of the air.

Subsequent names, rather than continuing the &quot;airy spirits&quot; theme (only Puck and Mab continuing the trend), have focused on Herschel&#x27;s source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer, Gerard Kuiper, after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter poem, all the rest being from Shakespeare). All the retrograde irregular moons are named after characters from one play, &quot;The Tempest&quot;; the only prograde irregular moon, Margaret, is named from &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

=== Neptune ===

The one known moon (at the time) of Neptune was not named for many decades. Although the name Triton was suggested in 1880 by Camille Flammarion, it did not come into general use until the mid 20th-century, and for many years was considered &quot;unofficial&quot;. In the astronomical literature it was simply referred to as &quot;the satellite of Neptune&quot;. Later, the second known moon, Nereid, was named by its discoverer in 1949, Gerard P. Kuiper, soon after its discovery.

Current IAU practice for newly discovered Neptunian moons is to accord with these first two choices by naming them after Greek sea deities.

For the &quot;normal&quot; irregular satellites, the general convention is to use names ending in &quot;a&quot; for prograde satellites, names ending in &quot;e&quot; for retrograde satellites, and names ending in &quot;o&quot; for exceptionally inclined satellites, exactly like the convention for the moons of Jupiter.

=== Pluto ===

The name of Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon was suggested by James W. Christy, its discoverer, soon after its discovery.

The other four moons are named Hydra, Nix, Kerberos, and Styx.

Charon, Hydra, Nix, and Kerberos are all characters in Greek mythology, with ties to Hades (the Greek equivalent of Pluto). Charon ferries the dead across the River Acheron, Hydra guards the waters of the underworld, and Nix (a respelling of Nyx), mother of Charon, is the goddess of darkness and the night. Kerberos is a giant three-headed dog who guards the entrance to the underworld. The fifth moon is named for the river Styx that forms the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead.

=== Eris ===

The name of Eris&#x27;s moon Dysnomia was suggested by its discoverer Michael E. Brown, who also suggested the name of the dwarf planet. The name has two meanings: in mythology Dysnomia (lawlessness) is the daughter of Eris (chaos). However, the name is also an intentional reference to the actor Lucy Lawless who plays the character . The background for this is that during the long period when Eris had no formal name, the name &#x27;Xena&#x27; – originally Brown&#x27;s nickname for his discovery – spread and became popular. When the name &#x27;Eris&#x27; was chosen, Brown suggested Dysnomia (which until then had been referred to as Gabrielle) as a reference to this. Hence, Dysnomia is the only moon which could be said to be named after an actor. The names Eris and Dysnomia were accepted by the IAU on 14 September 2006.

=== Haumea ===

The name of Haumea and its moons were suggested by David L. Rabinowitz of Caltech and refer to the mother goddess and her daughters in Hawaiian mythology.

=== Gonggong ===

When the discoverers of Gonggong proposed choices for a public vote on its name, they chose figures that had associates that could provide a name for the satellite. Xiangliu&#x27;s name was chosen by its discovery team led by Csaba Kiss.

=== Quaoar ===
Quaoar was named after the creator god of the Tongva tribe. Brown, who had co-discovered both Quaoar and its moon, left the name of the moon up to the Tongva. The Tongva chose the sky god Weywot, son of Quaoar.

=== Orcus ===

On 23 March 2009, Brown asked readers of his weekly column to suggest possible names for the satellite of Orcus which he had codiscovered, with the best one to be submitted to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on 5 April. The name Vanth, the winged Etruscan psychopomp who guides the souls of the dead to the underworld, was chosen from among a large pool of submissions. Vanth was the only suggestion that was purely Etruscan in origin. It was the most popular submission, first suggested by Sonya Taaffe.

The Etruscan Vanth is frequently portrayed in the company of Charun (Charon), and so as the name of the moon of Orcus (nicknamed the &quot;anti-Pluto&quot; because resonance with Neptune keeps it on the opposite side of the Sun from Pluto), it is an allusion to the parallels between Orcus and . Brown quoted Taaffe as saying that if Vanth &quot;accompanies dead souls from the moment of death to the underworld itself, then of course her face is turned always toward Orcus&quot;, a reference to the likely synchronous orbit of Vanth about Orcus.

=== Asteroids and other trans-Neptunian objects ===

Unlike the planets and dwarf planets, relatively few moons orbiting asteroids have been named. Among them are the following:
== Roman numeral designations ==
The Roman numbering system for satellites arose with the very first discovery of natural satellites other than Earth&#x27;s Moon: Galileo referred to the Galilean moons as I through IV (counting from Jupiter outward), refusing to adopt the names proposed by his rival Simon Marius. Similar numbering schemes naturally arose with the discovery of multiple moons around Saturn, Uranus, and Mars. The numbers initially designated the moons in orbital sequence, and were re-numbered after each new discovery; for instance, before the discovery of Mimas and Enceladus in 1789, Tethys was Saturn I, Dione Saturn II, etc., but after the new moons were discovered, Mimas became Saturn I, Enceladus Saturn II, Tethys Saturn III and Dione Saturn IV.

In the middle of the 19th century, however, the numeration became fixed, and later discoveries failed to conform with the orbital sequence scheme. Amalthea, discovered in 1892, was labelled &quot;Jupiter V&quot; although it orbits more closely to Jupiter than does Io (Jupiter I). The unstated convention then became, at the close of the 19th century, that the numbers more or less reflected the order of discovery, except for prior historical exceptions (see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites); though if a large number of satellites were discovered in a short span of time, the group could be numbered in orbital sequence, or according to other principles than strictly by order of discovery. The convention has been extended to natural satellites of minor planets, such as (87) Sylvia I Romulus. The outer irregular satellites of Jupiter (VI through XII) were left officially unnamed throughout this period, although as stated above some unofficial names were used in some contexts.

From 1975 to 2009, the International Astronomical Union was assigning names to all planetary satellites, and Roman numerals were usually not assigned to satellites until they are named. (An exception is Saturn&#x27;s moon Helene, which received the Roman numeral XII in 1982, but was not named until 1988.) During this period, the use of Roman numeral designations diminished, and some are very rarely used; Phobos and Deimos are rarely referred to as Mars I and Mars II, and the Moon is never referred to as &quot;Earth I&quot;. However, since 2015 some moons have again been numbered without being named, starting from Jupiter LI.

The thirteen named satellites of Saturn from Aegir to Surtur were named in alphabetical order corresponding to their Roman numerals.

== Provisional designations ==
When satellites are first discovered, they are given provisional designations such as &quot;S/2010 J 2&quot; (the 2nd new satellite of Jupiter discovered in 2010) or &quot;S/2003 S 1&quot; (the 1st new satellite of Saturn discovered in 2003). The initial &quot;S/&quot; stands for &quot;satellite&quot;, and distinguishes from such prefixes as &quot;D/&quot;, &quot;C/&quot;, and &quot;P/&quot;, used for comets. The designation &quot;R/&quot; is used for planetary rings. These designations are sometimes written like &quot;S/2003 S1&quot;, dropping the second space. The letter following the category and year identifies the planet (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; although no occurrence of the other planets is expected, Mars and Mercury are disambiguated through the use of Hermes for the latter). Pluto was designated by P prior to its recategorization as a dwarf planet. When the object is found around a minor planet, the identifier used is the latter&#x27;s number in parentheses. Thus, Dactyl, the moon of 243 Ida, was at first designated &quot;S/1993 (243) 1&quot;. Once confirmed and named, it became (243) Ida I Dactyl. Similarly, the fourth satellite of Pluto, Kerberos, discovered after Pluto was categorized as a dwarf planet and assigned a minor planet number, was designated S/2011 (134340) 1 rather than S/2011 P 1, though the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team, who maintained that dwarf planets were planets, used the latter.
* H = Mercury (Hermes)
* V = Venus
* E = Earth
* M = Mars
* J = Jupiter
* S = Saturn
* U = Uranus
* N = Neptune

After a few months or years, when a newly discovered satellite&#x27;s existence has been confirmed and its orbit computed, a permanent name is chosen, which replaces the &quot;S/&quot; provisional designation. However, in the past, some satellites remained unnamed for surprisingly long periods after their discovery.

== Timeline ==
The timeline only includes moons of the planets and the more likely dwarf planets. (no moons), , , , , , , , and (no moons) are generally agreed among astronomers to be dwarf planets. and are more controversial.

=== Pre-IAU names ===
The following names were adopted by informal processes preceding the assumption by the IAU of control over the assignment of satellite nomenclature in 1973.

=== IAU names ===
The following names were selected through a formal process controlled by the IAU. Only in a few cases is the person who chose the name identified.

==== 20th century ====
==== 21st century ====
For completeness, moons that were left unnamed upon their official numbering have also been included.

<text>Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned is a British free-form television talk show hosted by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner and produced by Avalon Television for ITV. It ran from 2000 to 2005. Its concept was developed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe prior to the television series. Alongside the television series, the show had a run in the West End at the Shaftesbury Theatre between 17 April and 12 May 2001 from which a ‘Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned - Live in the West End’ DVD was released.

==Format==

The intro to the show begins with a slow pan along an empty street before focussing on actor Lewis Rose who sings the intro before the crowds come in to join with a chant of &quot;It&#x27;ll never work&quot; and head into the theatre to watch the show. Baddiel and Skinner eventually join in with the crowds and enter themselves, singing &quot;And neither will we again!&quot;

The show features the two hosts sitting on a couch on-stage and responding to questions from the audience – at times rather seriously, but usually with bizarre digressions into satirical comedy. An audience member is chosen as &quot;Secretary&quot; and has the job of keeping a note of the topics covered on a white board. In practice, the personality of the secretary will also prompt many jokes – usually at his or her expense. At the end of the show, Skinner asks either the secretary or the audience to choose between two song books, and to pick a page number between 1 and 20. This process determines which song is performed by the duo, sung by Skinner with Baddiel accompanying him on piano (or, on at least one occasion, semi-acoustic guitar).

Topics of discussion are wholly mandated by the audience and have ranged from discussions of the war against Iraq and other political events to comments on the latest plot twists of popular soap operas and the Atkins diet. Skinner&#x27;s Catholicism and Baddiel&#x27;s Jewish culture are also occasional targets of humour (Baddiel describing Skinner&#x27;s faith as being &quot;insane&quot; and Skinner often using a music-hall Jewish accent to hold mock dialogues among members of Baddiel&#x27;s extended family, as well as both performers demonstrating how to &quot;play the piano in a convincingly Jewish manner&quot;).

To avoid it becoming too similar to the pair&#x27;s other show, &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;, an unofficial rule was introduced to prevent discussion of football-related topics.

==Episodes==

==Other versions==

In 2004, a similar series, with Australian comedy duo Merrick &amp; Rosso, aired in Australia - &quot;Merrick and Rosso Unplanned&quot;.

==Other &#x27;unplanned&#x27; content==
Baddiel &amp; Skinner produced a series of podcasts covering the 2006 FIFA World Cup for Avalon Television and &quot;The Times&quot;.

A special edition for Comic Relief called Baddiel &amp; Skinner unplanned &amp; unpaid was done in front of a celebrity audience in 2001.

<text>The National Ballet of Canada is a Canadian ballet company that was founded in 1951 in Toronto, Ontario, with Celia Franca, the first artistic director. A company of 70 dancers with its own orchestra, the National Ballet has been led since 2022 by artistic director Hope Muir. Renowned for its diverse repertoire, the company performs traditional full-length classics, embraces contemporary work and encourages the creation of new ballets, as well as the development of Canadian dancers and choreographers.

The company&#x27;s repertoire includes works by Sir Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, John Cranko, Rudolf Nureyev, John Neumeier, William Forsythe, James Kudelka, Wayne McGregor, Alexei Ratmansky, Crystal Pite, Christopher Wheeldon, Aszure Barton, Guillaume Côté and Robert Binet. The National Ballet tours in Canada and internationally, with appearances in London, Paris, Hamburg, Moscow, St. Petersburg, New York City, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

== Creation of the National Ballet of Canada ==
In 1951, the two major ballet companies in Canada were the Royal Winnipeg Ballet headed by Gweneth Lloyd, and the Volkoff Canadian Ballet founded by Boris Volkoff, which was based in Toronto. With the aim of creating a more widely based Canadian ballet troupe, following the example set by the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Royal Ballet, a group of Canadian ballet enthusiasts set out to create the National Ballet of Canada.

English ballet enthusiasts Sheila Bloom, Rosemary Winckley and Patricia Barnes (née Winckley), who were living in Toronto at the time, were responsible for the initial fundraising, which enabled the company to attract its first dancers, choreographers and artistic director. Both Lloyd and Volkoff were interested in being the first artistic director of the company, but the organizers agreed that the only way to ensure an unbiased selection of dancers for the new ballet company was to hire an outsider. They chose British dancer and choreographer Celia Franca, who had many connections within the dance community and had been to Canada only twice at that point, as artistic director.
Franca at first showed little interest in heading this new company; she had refused similar invitations in Australia and South Africa and liked living in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, when she came to Canada in 1951 to attend a festival, the founders again asked her to consider the position. Franca accepted the job and became the first artistic director, while Volkoff was appointed as Resident Choreographer. Conductor George Crum acted as Musical Director.

In August 1951, what was then The National Ballet Guild of Canada launched its first cross-country audition tour. By the end of the month, the ballet had chosen 29 dancers for the troupe and was rehearsing for their first performance in the St. Lawrence Hall.

For The National Ballet Guild of Canada&#x27;s early performances, Franca chose classic ballets, as she believed this would allow the dancers to be properly judged by the international dance community. The first performance was in the Eaton Auditorium on November 12, 1951. The program included &quot;Les Sylphides&quot; and Polovtsian Dances from &quot;Prince Igor&quot;.

== Development ==
The company toured Canada extensively, with Franca, Lois Smith and David Adams as its stars. In 1964, the National Ballet adopted the 3200-seat O&#x27;Keefe Centre (now known as Meridian Hall) in Toronto as its home venue. The company moved in 2006 to new facilities at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, which was purpose-built for ballet and opera, and is shared with the Canadian Opera Company.

In 1976, Alexander Grant, former Principal Dancer with London&#x27;s Royal Ballet and Artistic Director of Ballet for All, became the Artistic Director of the National Ballet. Under his leadership, the company added a number of works by Frederick Ashton to its repertoire. The National Ballet of Canada became the first Canadian company to perform at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London in 1979.

In 1981 the company participated alongside Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, le Groupe de la Place Royale, the Danny Grossman Dance Company, the Toronto Dance Theatre, Winnipeg Contemporary Dancers and the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre in the Canadian Dance Spectacular, a dance show at Ottawa&#x27;s National Arts Centre which was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada for the 1982 documentary film &quot;Gala&quot;.

In 1989, Reid Anderson became the artistic director. He led the company through a difficult economic recession by choreographing traditional ballet pieces while also commissioning Canadian and international choreographers to create contemporary pieces. In 1995, he left the company citing a frustration of the continued funding cuts from the government, and the directorship was taken up in 1996 by choreographer James Kudelka.

In 2005, Karen Kain, former Principal Dancer, became Artistic Director of the company. In 2009, &quot;Innovation&quot; debuted, a mixed programme featuring three world premieres by Canadian choreographers Crystal Pite, Sabrina Matthews and Peter Quanz. In 2011, the company premiered a new version of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by Alexei Ratmansky. The National Ballet of Canada remains Canada&#x27;s largest and most influential dance company.

In June 2020, Kain stepped down from the company. The following month, it was announced that Hope Muir will succeed Kain, effective January 1, 2022.

== Canada&#x27;s National Ballet School ==

The Canada&#x27;s National Ballet School was founded in 1959 by Celia Franca and Julia Bondy and was directed for many years by co-founder Betty Oliphant. The primary goal of the school is to train dancers for the National Ballet of Canada and also for companies across Canada and around the world. Graduates of the School include Frank Augustyn, Neve Campbell, Anne Ditchburn, Rex Harrington, Karen Kain (former Artistic Director of the Company), James Kudelka (former Artistic Director of the Company), Veronica Tennant, Martine Lamy, John Alleyne, Emmanuel Sandhu, and Mavis Staines (Artistic Director and Co-CEO of the School).

== International recognition ==
Rudolf Nureyev danced with the company in 1965 and returned in 1972 to stage his version of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;. His work is credited to raising the standards of the company. He was responsible for bringing the Company to Lincoln Center&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera House in New York City where he showcased the company. The Ballet met with rave reviews and this was a pivotal point in receiving recognition internationally. Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn, two members of NBC, received the prize for best pas de deux at the International Ballet Competition in Moscow in 1973. The following year, in 1974, while on a tour in Canada, Mikhail Baryshnikov defected and requested political asylum in Toronto. His first televised performance after coming out of temporary seclusion in Canada was with the National Ballet of Canada in a version of &quot;La Sylphide&quot;. More recently the company co-produced Christopher Wheeldon’s The Winter’s Tale with The Royal Ballet in London. The New York Times’ Alastair MaCauley declared that he admired it more in The National Ballet of Canada’s performance than when he &quot;saw the ballet’s first performances in London, principally because of Evan McKie’s eloquent interpretation of Leontes.&quot; Macaulay also highly praised Francesco Gabriele Frola, Svetlana Lunkina &amp; Jurgita Dronina; all four dancers being Kain recruits. A duet between Hermione (Dronina) and Leontes (McKie) was &quot;a particular breakthrough for Mr. Wheeldon&quot; as well.

<text>Joseph Guillemot (1 October 1899 – 9 March 1975) was a French middle- and long-distance runner. He won the 5000 metres and was second in the 10,000 metres at the 1920 Summer Olympics.

== Career ==
Guillemot&#x27;s athletics career began while he was serving in World War I. During the war he won the national cross-country championships of the French military. He then returned to the front and fought until the Armistice on 11 November 1918.

During World War I, Guillemot was the victim of an accident that left his right lung permanently damaged by mustard gas. In addition, his heart was located on the right-hand side of his chest. Nevertheless, Guillemot went on to have a successful career in athletics.

In 1920 Guillemot won the French national championship in the 5000 m, which qualified him for the Olympic Games in Antwerp later that year. The favourite for the 5000 m in Antwerp was Paavo Nurmi. In the final of the 5000 m, Nurmi ran at a high pace in the first half of the race as a strategy to exhaust the Swedes Eric Backman and Rudolf Falk. Only Guillemot was able to follow Nurmi&#x27;s pace. Guillemot passed Nurmi on the last bend to take the victory.

Guillemot then took the silver medal in the 10,000 m behind Nurmi. The final of the 10,000 m was brought forward by three hours at the request of King Albert of Belgium, which Guillemot was only informed of after eating a large lunch. Suffering from stomach cramps and wearing shoes that were two sizes too large (as his own shoes had been stolen), Guillemot finished 1.4 seconds behind Nurmi in second place.

After the 1920 Olympics, Guillemot won three titles in the International Cross Country Championships: one individual title in 1922 and two with the French team in 1922 and 1926. He won the French 5000 m title on three occasions, but missed the 1924 Olympics due to disagreements with the French Athletics Union.

== World records ==
Guillemot held two world records: 2000 m (5:34.8) and 3000 m (8:42.2).

== Death ==
Having been a pack a day cigarette smoker, Guillemot died of lung cancer in Oradour-Saint-Genest at the age of 75.

<doc id="826602" wikidata="Q4936090" url="?curid=826602" title="Boca Grande, Florida">
<text>Boca Grande is a small residential community on Gasparilla Island in southwest Florida. Gasparilla Island is a part of both Charlotte and Lee counties, while the actual village of Boca Grande, which is home to many seasonal and some year-round residents, is entirely in the Lee County portion of the island. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Boca Grande is known for its historic downtown, sugar sand beaches, blue water and world class fishing.

==Overview==
The community&#x27;s name – Spanish for &quot;Big Mouth&quot; – comes from the mouth of the waterway, called Boca Grande Pass, separating the southern tip of the island from Cayo Costa. The pass was used as a busy shipping point for many years, as the waters in the pass are naturally deep. Processed phosphate from the Bone Valley region was loaded onto waiting ocean-going cargo vessels via the Seaboard Air Line Railroad at the dock located on the southern tip of the island. Shipping business to the island declined in the late 1970s, as it was no longer cost effective to ship phosphate by rail to Boca Grande when it could be loaded at Tampa. The phosphate plant at Boca Grande was old and its tons-per-hour rate was slow. Therefore, it made economic sense to discontinue the operation. Evidence of the island&#x27;s industrial past can still be seen.
There are no gas stations in the village of Boca Grande, with the exception of a street pump at Boca Grande Marina, so many residents use golf carts as their main mode of transportation. A Lee County ordinance designates all but two streets as golf cart paths. Drivers must be at least 14 years old to operate a golf cart on these designated streets.

Boca Grande provided the backdrop for Denzel Washington&#x27;s movie, &quot;Out of Time&quot;, where the quiet village was renamed &quot;Banyan Key&quot; in reference to the banyan trees that populate the island. Scenes for the 2006 film based on Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s book &quot;Hoot&quot; were also filmed on the island, which was again renamed for the filming. This time it became &quot;Coconut Cove&quot;.

Boca Grande&#x27;s serene beauty makes it a destination for high-profile weddings and residences for the elite seeking privacy. Sara Blakely (Spanx founder and owner) and Jesse Itzler were married on Boca Grande in 2008, while the Bush family and Audrey Hepburn have called it home seasonally.

Hurricane Charley hit Boca Grande heavily on August 13, 2004, causing some US$20 billion worth of damage to Southwest Florida. There were no deaths or injuries on the island, but many buildings and numerous banyan trees were heavily damaged.

==History==

===Indigenous history===
Gasparilla Island&#x27;s first known inhabitants were the Calusa people. They were living on nearby Useppa Island by 5,000 BC and on Gasparilla Island by 800 or 900 AD. Charlotte Harbor was the center of the Calusa Empire, which numbered thousands of people and hundreds of fishing villages. The Calusa were a hunting and fishing people who perfected the art of maritime living in harmony with the environment. They were a politically powerful people, dominating Southwest Florida during their &quot;golden age&quot;. Since the Calusa had no written language, the only record of their lifestyle and ceremonies comes from the oral history of the (much later) Seminoles, from written accounts of Spanish explorers, and from the archaeological record. The first contact the Calusa had with Europeans came during Spanish explorations at the beginning of the 16th century. By the mid-18th century, the Calusa had all but disappeared, the victims of European diseases, slavery and warfare.

Just like the Calusa, the next settlers came to Gasparilla Island to fish. By the late 1870s several fish ranches were operating in the Charlotte Harbor area. One of them would later be at the north end of Gasparilla Island in the small village of Gasparilla. The fishermen, many of them Spanish or Cuban, caught large quantities of mullet and other fish and salted them down for shipment to Havana and other markets. In the 1940s the Gasparilla Fishery was moved to Placida across the bay, where it still stands, and the fishing village died out. Many of Boca Grande&#x27;s early fishing families are still represented in third-, fourth- and fifth-generation descendants who pursue many different vocations, including fishing.

===Phosphate and tarpon industries===
In 1885, phosphate rock was discovered on the banks of the Peace River just above Punta Gorda, east of Gasparilla Island across Charlotte Harbor. It was this discovery that would turn the south end of Gasparilla Island into a major deep-water port (Boca Grande Pass is one of the deepest natural inlets in Florida) and become responsible for the development of the town of Boca Grande. Wealthy American and British sportsmen began discovering the Charlotte Harbor area for its fishing (notably for the world-class tarpon) and hunting. It was these two discoveries – phosphate rock and fishing – that would &quot;put Boca Grande on the map&quot;.

Phosphate was a valuable mineral for fertilizers and many other products, and was in great demand worldwide. At first the phosphate was barged down the Peace River to Port Boca Grande, where it was loaded onto schooners for worldwide shipment. By 1905 it was felt that building a railroad to Port Boca Grande and carrying the phosphate to it by rail would improve the method of shipment.

In 1905, officials of the Agrico subsidiary Peace River Mining Company, along with engineers from the Army Corps of Engineers and 60 laborers, landed on Gasparilla Island, and surveying and construction of the railroad began. Probably the only buildings on the south end of the island at this time were the lighthouse and the assistant keeper&#x27;s house. The railroad terminus with its pier would be built nearby. The Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad was completed in 1907. For the next 50 years phosphate was shipped out of the state-of-the-art port virtually without disruption. Phosphate-laden trains were off-loaded directly onto ocean-going freighters, and the ships took the valuable commodity to ports all over the world. In 1969 Port Boca Grande ranked as the fourth-busiest port in Florida.

In the 1970s, phosphate companies increasingly switched their interest to ports in Hillsborough and Manatee counties. As more money was put into developing these ports, traffic into Port Boca Grande began to dwindle, and in 1979 the line was abandoned and the phosphate industry in Boca Grande came to an end. The port was also used as an oil storage terminal by Florida Power and Light Company. This use ceased in 2001. The oil storage tanks were subsequently removed from the site at the southern tip of Gasparilla Island adjacent to the 120-year-old Boca Grande Lighthouse. Island residents have begun an effort to have the property preserved as part of the island&#x27;s state park system.

The Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway not only brought phosphate and supplies to Gasparilla Island; it also brought wealthy people from the north. By 1910 Boca Grande Pass was already famous for its unequaled tarpon fishing among fishermen, who stayed on nearby Useppa Island. The Agrico Company, having begun to see the potential of developing Gasparilla Island beyond the port, began to develop the village of Boca Grande.

===Early development; status as vacation destination===
The railroad station in what would become downtown was built; roads, sidewalks, streetlights, shops, a post office, and water and telephone service were not far behind. The town was landscaped, including the now famous section of Second Street called Banyan Street. The railroad company built several cottages downtown, and a few wealthy families from &quot;up north&quot; purchased land and built winter residences. The train stopped at Gasparilla, the fishing village at the north end of the island, at the railroad depot in downtown Boca Grande, and at the south end phosphate terminal.

In 1911, the first hotel, the Gasparilla Inn, opened, and the island became a major vacation destination for the elite from Tampa, Fort Myers, and New England. Though shipping has declined substantially since the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism remains important to the island&#x27;s economy.

In 1925, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad bought the assets and property of the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway, but it took the Interstate Commerce Commission three years to approve it, and the SAL finally merged with the CH&amp;N in 1928. The Tampa to Boca Grande passenger train was still operated every day, along with a fast freight between Boca Grande and Plant City, until the SCL era slowly killed the port, forcing all phosphate traffic to Tampa Bay.
In 1929 the Boca Grande Hotel was built just south of the Boca Grande city center. It was a three-story, brick resort hotel where most of the island weathered the hurricane of 1944. The Boca Grande Hotel changed hands and was demolished in 1975. When attempt was made to demolish the hotel with explosives, it was unsuccessful. In total, explosive demolition was attempted three times. Finally, it took six months to raze the building by means of fire and the wrecking ball, as it had been built to withstand fire and great storms.

The railroad continued to bring winter visitors from all along the eastern seaboard and upper Midwest until the Boca Grande Causeway opened in 1958. The swing bridge spans two channels on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at Placida Harbor. It was built from 1952 to 1958 to replace a ferry service. When the bridge became operational, it was faster to fly to Tampa and drive to Boca Grande than it was to take the train directly from the Northeast and Midwest. Rail passenger service to Boca Grande ended on April 12, 1959.
===1970s to present day===
The depot was restored in the 1970s, and a number of shops, offices and a restaurant now occupy the old building. The railroad continued to run work trains to the south end until the phosphate port closed in 1979. The rail line between Arcadia and Boca Grande was abandoned in 1981. Thanks to the generosity of Bayard and Hugh Sharp (members of the Du Pont family who had been winter residents for many years), the community purchased the old railroad bed from CSX Corp. (the successor corporation to the old Chessie and Seaboard systems) and transformed it into a new use—Boca Grande&#x27;s popular Bike Path. Boca Grande has always been a unique community, with a large number of wealthy winter residents rubbing elbows with the fishermen and railroad and port workers who formed the permanent, year-round working population.

==Fishing==
The Boca Grande Pass is considered one of the world&#x27;s best tarpon fishing spots.

Tarpon congregate and spawn out of passes along most of the entire rim of the Gulf of Mexico. The massive attraction to Boca Grande Pass is unknown and subject to many theories. In the spring, it appears that many of the fish&#x27;s habits all along the coast are in orientation to Boca Grande Pass. With depths reaching near , it is the deepest natural pass in Florida. It is the only major outlet of Charlotte Harbor, which is fed by two major rivers, the Peace and the Myakka. As the bottleneck of the harbor, the currents are strong and serve as an underwater highway for many species of fish and bait.

Harpooning tarpon is documented back to the late 1700s by British settlers. There is some debate among historians on who caught the first tarpon on rod and reel in Florida. The fish gained fame from an 1885 story published in the magazine &quot;Forest and Stream&quot;. The article detailed an event that took place on March 12, 1885, when a New Yorker named W. H. Wood landed a tarpon at the mouth of the Caloosahatchee River. While it may have not been the first tarpon caught on rod and reel, the fish&#x27;s capture generated much publicity and is at least credited as exposing tarpon fishing to the world. Soon after, tarpon were given a game fish status to protect them from harpoons (known as &quot;striking&quot; or &quot;graining&quot;) and nets that were common methods of taking tarpon.
In the late 1890s, a then-modern railway system was completed that gave the area access to the outside world. Soon sportsmen from the north as well as from Britain flocked to the area in quest for giant tarpon. Southwest Florida and the Florida Keys soon became the new headquarters of the sport fishing world. Fishing tourism grew even bigger when in 1908 Barron Collier built a &quot;Tarpon Inn&quot; on Gasparilla Island and made the island&#x27;s town of Boca Grande world-famous as the &quot;Tarpon Fishing Capital of the World&quot;.

== Demographics ==
In 2012, Boca Grande reported a population of 1,705 citizens. The median age of Boca Grande is 66.

<doc id="826604" wikidata="Q20669447" url="?curid=826604" title="Public inquiry">
<text>A public inquiry, also known as a tribunal of inquiry, government inquiry, or simply inquiry, is an official review of events or actions ordered by a government body. In many common law countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Canada, such an inquiry differs from a royal commission in that a public inquiry accepts evidence and conducts its hearings in a more public forum and focuses on a more specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may make (written) evidential submissions, as is the case with most inquiries, and also listen to oral evidence given by other parties.

Typical events for a public inquiry are those that cause multiple deaths, such as public transport crashes or mass murders.

Advocacy groups and opposition political parties are likely to ask for public inquiries for all manner of issues. The government of the day typically only accedes to a fraction of these requests. The political decision whether to appoint a public inquiry into an event was found to be dependent on several factors. The first is the extent of media coverage of the event; those that receive more media interest are more likely to be inquired. Second, since the appointment of a public inquiry is typically made by government ministers, events that involve allegations of blame on the part of the relevant minister are less likely to be investigated by a public inquiry. Third, a public inquiry generally takes longer to report and costs more on account of its public nature. When a government refuses a public inquiry on some topic, it is usually on at least one of these grounds.

The conclusions of the inquiry are delivered in the form of a written report, given first to the government, and soon after made public. Reports usually make recommendations to improve the quality of government or management of public organisations in the future. A 2016 study found that the reports of public inquiries are not effective in changing public opinion regarding the event in question. Empirical studies do not find support for the claim that appointing a public inquiry leads to a decline in media attention to the inquired issue. Public inquiry reports appear to enjoy public trust only when they are critical of a government, and tend to lose credibility when they find no fault on the part of the government.

==France==
In France, any major project which requires the compulsory acquisition of private property must, before being approved, be the subject of a public inquiry (usually by the prefect of the region or department in which the project will take place); the favourable outcome of such an inquiry is a &quot;déclaration d&#x27;utilité publique&quot;, a formal finding that the project will produce public benefit. This procedure was established by the law on expropriation enacted on 7 July 1833, which extended an earlier law enacted in 1810.

==Ireland==
== South Africa ==

A number of historically important public inquiries have taken place in South Africa since the advent of full democracy in 1994. A number of which have looked into national scale events such as systematic human rights abuses during apartheid or wide scale corruption.

==United Kingdom==
==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance was enacted for establishing such a commission. The commission established after the 2012 Lamma Island ferry collision produced a report of its findings which they made public; an internal report was kept confidential. In the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, one of the five key demands of the protesters, was establishing another commission for the protests itself.

<doc id="826616" wikidata="Q1044456" url="?curid=826616" title="Ten Great Campaigns">
<text>The Ten Great Campaigns () were a series of military campaigns launched by the Qing dynasty of China in the mid–late 18th century during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796). They included three to enlarge the area of Qing control in Inner Asia: two against the Dzungars (1755–1757) and the &quot;pacification&quot; of Xinjiang (1758–1759). The other seven campaigns were more in the nature of police actions on frontiers already established: two wars to the Gyalrong of Jinchuan, Sichuan, another to the Taiwanese aboriginals (1787–1788), and four expeditions abroad against the Burmese (1765–1769), the Vietnamese (1788–1789), and the Gurkhas on the border between Tibet and Nepal (1790–1792), with the last counting as two.

== Campaigns ==
=== Three campaigns against the Dzungars and the pacification of Xinjiang (1755–1759) ===


Of the ten campaigns, the final destruction of the Dzungars (or Zunghars) was the most significant. The 1755 pacification of Dzungaria and the later suppression of the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas secured the northern and western boundaries of Xinjiang, eliminated rivalry for control over the Dalai Lama in Tibet, and thereby eliminated any rival influence in Mongolia. 

==== First campaign ====

In 1752, Dawachi and the Khoit-Oirat prince Amursana competed for the title of Khan of the Dzungars. Dawachi defeated Amursana various times and gave him no chance to recover. Amursana was thus forced to flee with his small army to the Qing imperial court. The Qianlong Emperor pledged to support Amursana since Amursana accepted Qing authority; among those who supported Amursana and the Chinese were the Khoja brothers and . In 1755, Qianlong sent the Manchu general Zhaohui, who was aided by Amursana, Burhān al-Dīn and Khwāja-i Jahān, to lead a campaign against the Dzungars. After several skirmishes and small scale battles along the river Ili, the Qing army led by Zhaohui approached Ili (Gulja) and forced Dawachi to surrender. Qianlong appointed Amursana as the Khan of Khoit and one of four equal khans – much to the displeasure of Amursana, who wanted to be the Khan of the Dzungars.

==== Second campaign ====
In the summer of 1756, Amursana started a Dzungar revolt against the Chinese with the help of Prince Chingünjav. The Qing dynasty reacted at the start of 1757 and sent General Zhaohui with support from Burhān al-Dīn and Khwāja-i Jahān. Among several battles, the most important ones were illustrated in Qianlong&#x27;s paintings. The Dzungar leader Ayushi defected to the Qing side and attacked the Dzungar camp at Gadan-Ola (Battle of Gadan-Ola).

General Zhaohui defeated the Dzungars in two battles: the Battle of Oroi-Jalatu (1758) and the Battle of Khurungui (1758). In the first battle, Zhaohui attacked Amursana&#x27;s camp at night; Amursana was able to fight on until Zhaohui received enough reinforcements to drive him away. Between the time of Oroi-Jalatu and Khurungui, the Chinese under Prince Cäbdan-jab defeated Amursana at the Battle of Khorgos (known in the Qianlong engravings as the &quot;Victory of Khorgos&quot;). At Mount Khurungui, Zhaohui defeated Amursana in a night attack on his camp after crossing a river and drove him back. To commemorate Zhaohui&#x27;s two victories, Qianlong had the Puning Temple of Chengde constructed, home to the world&#x27;s tallest wooden sculpture of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and hence its alternate name, the &quot;Big Buddha Temple&quot;. Afterwards, Khojis of Us-Turfan submitted to the Qing dynasty. After all of these battles, Amursana fled to Russia (where he died) while Chingünjav fled north to Darkhad but was captured at Wang Tolgoi and executed in Beijing.

==== Third campaign====

====Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas (1757-1759)====

After the second campaign against the Dzungars in 1758, two Altishahr nobles, the Khoja brothers Burhān al-Dīn and Khwāja-i Jahān, started a revolt against the Qing dynasty. Apart from the remaining Dzungars, they were also joined by the Kyrgyz peoples and the Oases Turkic peoples (Uyghurs) in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin). After capturing several towns in Altishahr, there were still two rebel fortresses at Yarkand and Kashgar at the end of 1758. Uyghur Muslims from Turfan and Hami, including Emin Khoja and Khoja Si Bek, remained loyal to the Qing dynasty and helped the Qing regime fight the Altishahri Uyghurs under Burhān al-Dīn and Khwāja-i Jahān. Zhaohui unsuccessfully besieged Yarkand and fought an indecisive battle outside the city; this engagement is historically known as the Battle of Tonguzluq. Zhaohui instead took other towns east of Yarkand but was forced to retreat; the Dzungar and Uyghur rebels laid siege to him at the siege of Black River (Kara Usu). In 1759, Zhaohui asked for reinforcements and 600 troops were sent, under the overall command of generals Fude and Machang, with the 200 cavalry led by Namjil; other high-ranking officers included Arigun, Doubin, Duanjibu, Fulu, Yan Xiangshi, Janggimboo, Yisamu, Agui and Shuhede. On 3 February 1759, over 5,000 enemy cavalry led by Burhān al-Dīn ambushed the 600 relief troops at the Battle of Qurman. The Uyghur and Dzungar cavalry were stopped by the Qing zamburak artillery camels, musketry, and archers; Namjil and Machang led a cavalry charge on one of the flanks. Namjil was killed while Machang was unseated from horseback and was forced to fight on foot with his bow. After a hard-fought battle, the Qing forces emerged victorious and attacked the Dzungar camp, causing the Dzungars besieging the Black River to withdraw. After the victory at Qurman, the Qing army overran the remaining rebel towns. Mingrui led a detachment of cavalry and defeated Dzungar cavalry at the Battle of Qos-Qulaq. The Uyghurs retreated from Qos-Qulaq but were defeated by Zhaohui and Fude at the Battle of Arcul (Altishahr) on 1 September 1759. The rebels were defeated again at the Battle of Yesil Kol Nor. After these defeats, Burhān al-Dīn and Khwāja-i Jahān fled with their small army of supporters to Badakhshan. Sultan Shah of Badakhshan promised to protect them but he contacted the Qing dynasty and promised to turn them over. When the fleeing rebels came to the Sultan&#x27;s capital, he attacked them and captured them. When the Qing army reached Sultan Shah&#x27;s capital, he handed over the captured rebels to them and submitted to the Qing dynasty. In later years, Durrani Afghanistan and the Khanate of Bukhara invaded Badakhshan and killed Sultan Shah for betraying Khojas to the Qing, while the latter did not respond.

=== Suppression of the Jinchuan hill peoples (1747–1749, 1771–1776) ===
==== First campaign ====
The suppression of Jinchuan was the costliest and most difficult, and also the most destructive of the Ten Great Campaigns. Jinchuan (lit. &quot;Golden Stream&quot;) was located northwest of Chengdu in western Sichuan. Its residents were the Gyalrong tribes, related to the Tibetans of Amdo. The first campaign in 1747–1749 was a simple affair; with little use of force the Qing army induced the native chieftains to accept a peace plan, and departed.

==== Second campaign ====
Interethnic conflict brought Qing intervention back after 20 years. The result was the Qing forces being forced to fight a protracted war of attrition costing the Imperial Treasury several times the amounts expended on the earlier conquests of the Dzungars and Xinjiang. The resisting tribes retreated to their stone towers and forts in steep mountains and could only be dislodged by cannon fire. The Qing generals were ruthless in annihilating the local Gyalrong Tibetans, then reorganised the region in a military prefecture and repopulated it with more cooperative inhabitants. When victorious troops returned to Beijing, a celebratory hymn was sung in their honour. A Manchu version of the hymn was recorded by the French Jesuit Jean Joseph Marie Amiot and sent to Paris.

=== Campaigns in Burma (1765–1769) ===
The Qianlong Emperor launched four invasions of Burma between 1765 and 1769. The war claimed the lives of over 70,000 Qing soldiers and four commanders, and is sometimes described as &quot;the most disastrous frontier war that the Qing dynasty had ever waged&quot;, and one that &quot;assured Burmese independence and probably the independence of other states in Southeast Asia&quot;. The successful Burmese defence laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between Myanmar and China.

==== First and second invasion ====
At first, Qianlong envisaged an easy war, and sent in only the Green Standard troops stationed in Yunnan. The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in the Burmese invasion of the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765 and 1766 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military maneuvers nationwide in both countries.

==== Third invasion ====
The third invasion (1767–1768) led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days&#x27; march from the capital, Ava. However, the Bannermen of northern China could not cope with unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases, and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close-call, King Hsinbyushin redeployed most of the Burmese armies from Siam to the Chinese border. The successful Burmese defence laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between Myanmar and China.

The Qing Qianlong Emperor ordered Manchu general Eledeng&#x27;e (also spelled E&#x27;erdeng&#x27;e () or possibly ) to be sliced to death after his commander Mingrui was defeated at the Battle of Maymyo in the Sino-Burmese War in 1768 because Eledeng&#x27;i was not able to help flank Mingrui when he did not arrive at a rendezvous.

==== Fourth invasion ====
The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier. With the Qing forces completely encircled, a truce was reached between the field commanders of the two sides in December 1769.

==== Aftermath ====
The Qing forces maintained a heavy military presence in the border areas of Yunnan for about a decade in an attempt to wage another war while imposing a ban on inter-border trade for two decades. The Burmese were also preoccupied with another impending invasion by the Qing dynasty, and kept a series of garrisons along the border. After twenty years, Burma and the Qing dynasty resumed a diplomatic relationship in 1790. To the Burmese, the resumption was on equal terms. However, the Qianlong Emperor unilaterally interpreted the act as Burmese submission, and claimed victory. Ironically, the main beneficiaries of this war were the Siamese. After having lost their capital Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, they regrouped in the absence of large Burmese armies, and reclaimed their territories over the next two years.

=== Taiwan rebellion (1786–1788) ===
In 1786, the Qing-appointed Governor of Taiwan, , discovered and suppressed the anti-Qing Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society). The Tiandihui members gathered Ming loyalists, and their leader proclaimed himself king. Many important people took part in this revolt and the insurgents quickly rose to 50,000 people. In less than a year, the rebels occupied almost all of southern Taiwan. Hearing that the rebels had occupied most of Taiwan, Qing troops were sent to suppress them in a hurry. The east insurgents defeated the poorly organised troops and had to resist falling to the enemy. Finally, the Qing imperial court sent Fuk&#x27;anggan while , Counsellor of the Police, deployed nearly 3,000 people to fight the insurgents. These new troops were well equipped, disciplined and had combat experience which proved enough to rout the insurgents. The Ming loyalists had lost the war and their leaders and remaining rebels hid among the locals.

Lin Shuangwen, and other Tiandihui leaders had started a rebellion. The Qing general Fuk&#x27;anggan quelled the rebellion with a force of 20,000 soldiers and executed Lin Shuangwen.

=== Two campaigns against the Gurkhas (1788–1793) ===
The campaigns against the Gurkhas displayed the Qing imperial court&#x27;s continuing sensitivity to conditions in Tibet.

==== First campaign ====
The late 1760s saw the creation of a strong centralised state in Nepal. The Gurkha rulers of Nepal decided to invade southern Tibet in 1788.

The two Manchu resident agents (ambans) in Lhasa made no attempt at defence or resistance. Instead, they took the child Panchen Lama to safety when the Nepalese troops came through and plundered the rich monastery at Shigatse on their way to Lhasa. Upon hearing of the first Nepalese incursions, the Qianlong Emperor ordered troops from Sichuan to proceed to Lhasa and restore order. By the time they reached southern Tibet, the Gurkhas had already withdrawn. This counted as the first of two wars with the Gurkhas.

==== Second campaign ====
In 1791, the Gurkhas returned in force. Qianlong urgently dispatched an army of 10,000. It was made up of around 6,000 Manchu and Mongol forces supplemented by tribal soldiers under the general Fuk&#x27;anggan, with as his deputy. They entered Tibet from Xining in the north, shortening the march but making it in the dead of winter 1791–92, crossing high mountain passes in deep snow and cold. They reached central Tibet in the summer of 1792 and within two or three months could report that they had won a decisive series of encounters that pushed the Gurkha armies. The Nepalese then successfully used stretching tactics against the Chinese army, which was 3–4 times larger. The Nepalese began pull back, making the Chinese uncomfortably overstretched. At Nuwakot, the Chinese faced a strong counterattack with Khukuri. Since Nepal was expanding to the west and Fuk&#x27;anggan was keen to protect his army, both sides signed a peace treaty at Betrawati. The peace treaty was more favourable to the Qing, as the terms forced Nepal to pay tribute to the Qing dynasty every five years.

=== Campaign in Đại Việt (1788–1789) ===

Since the 17th century, Vietnam was divided into two parts: the southern part was Đàng Trong or Cochinchina, ruled by the Nguyễn lords and the northern part was Đàng Ngoài or Tonkin, ruled by the Trịnh lords under the puppet Lê emperors. In 1771, the Tây Sơn rebellion broke out in southern Vietnam, led by the brothers Nguyễn Nhạc, Nguyễn Huệ and Nguyễn Lữ, who removed the local Nguyễn lord from power.

After the capture of Phú Xuân (modern Huế), Nguyễn Hữu Chỉnh, a traitor of Trịnh&#x27;s general, encouraged Nguyễn Huệ to overthrow the Trịnh lord. Huệ took his advice, marched north and captured Đông Kinh (modern Hanoi). In 1788, Lê Chiêu Thống was installed the new Lê emperor by Huệ. Huệ then retreated to Phú Xuân.

Meanwhile, Lê Chiêu Thống never abandoned his attempt to regain the throne. Lê Quýnh, Empress Dowager Mẫn and the eldest son of Lê Chiêu Thống, fled to Longzhou, Guangxi, to seek support from Qing China. A large Qing army invaded Vietnam to restore Lê Chiêu Thống to the throne. However, the Chinese army was defeated by the Tây Sơn army and after subsequent reconciliation, Qianlong recognised Nguyễn Huệ (aka Quang Trung) as the ruler of Vietnam.

What motivated the Qing imperial government to interfere in Vietnam&#x27;s domestic affairs has always been disputed. Chinese scholars claimed that the Qianlong Emperor simply wanted to restore the Lê emperor to the throne in order to end instability in Vietnam while not seeking any territorial gains. Vietnamese scholars on the other hand have argued, that Qianlong intended to make Vietnam a vassal. China would station troops in Vietnam and install Lê Chiêu Thống as its puppet king.

== In perspective ==
In his later years, the Qianlong Emperor referred to himself with the grandiose style name of &quot;Old Man of the Ten Completed [Great Campaigns]&quot; (十全老人). He also wrote an essay enumerating the victories in 1792, &quot;Record of Ten Completions&quot; (十全記).

However, the campaigns were a major financial drain on the Qing dynasty, costing more than 151 million silver taels. Nearly 1.5 million piculs (1 picul = 100 catties) of cargo were transported for the campaign in Taiwan.

The outcomes of the campaigns were also modest. Although the tribes at Jinchuan numbered less than 30,000 households, they took five years to pacify. The Qing campaigns in Burma, while nearly toppling the Ava regime at one point, failed to seriously destroy Burma and settled for continued tributary status from Burma and consolidated the political situation of a tripartite Mainland Southeast Asia (the three major states of Burma, Siam, and Vietnam). Instead of restoring Lê Chiêu Thống to the throne in Vietnam as the campaign had intended, the Qianlong Emperor ended up making peace with the new Tây Sơn dynasty and arranged for marriages between the imperial families of Qing and Tây Sơn.

<doc id="826617" wikidata="Q206793" url="?curid=826617" title="Euclid's lemma">
<text>In algebra and number theory, Euclid&#x27;s lemma is a lemma that captures a fundamental property of prime numbers:

For example, if , , , then , and since this is divisible by 19, the lemma implies that one or both of 133 or 143 must be as well. In fact, .

The lemma first appeared in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, and is a fundamental result in elementary number theory.

If the premise of the lemma does not hold, that is, if is a composite number, its consequent may be either true or false. For example, in the case of , , , composite number 10 divides , but 10 divides neither 4 nor 15.

This property is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. It is used to define prime elements, a generalization of prime numbers to arbitrary commutative rings. Euclid&#x27;s lemma shows that in the integers irreducible elements are also prime elements. The proof uses induction so it does not apply to all integral domains.

==Formulations==
Euclid&#x27;s lemma is commonly used in the following equivalent form:
Euclid&#x27;s lemma can be generalized as follows from prime numbers to any integers.
This is a generalization because a prime number is coprime with an integer if and only if does not divide .

==History==
The lemma first appears as proposition 30 in Book VII of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. It is included in practically every book that covers elementary number theory.

The generalization of the lemma to integers appeared in Jean Prestet&#x27;s textbook &quot;Nouveaux Elémens de Mathématiques&quot; in 1681.

In Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s treatise &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;, the statement of the lemma is Euclid&#x27;s Proposition 14 (Section 2), which he uses to prove the uniqueness of the decomposition product of prime factors of an integer (Theorem 16), admitting the existence as &quot;obvious&quot;. From this existence and uniqueness he then deduces the generalization of prime numbers to integers. For this reason, the generalization of Euclid&#x27;s lemma is sometimes referred to as Gauss&#x27;s lemma, but some believe this usage is incorrect due to confusion with Gauss&#x27;s lemma on quadratic residues.

==Proofs==
The two first subsections, are proofs of the generalized version of Euclid&#x27;s lemma, namely that: &quot;if divides and is coprime with then it divides .&quot;

The original Euclid&#x27;s lemma follows immediately, since, if is prime then it divides or does not divide in which case it is coprime with so per the generalized version it divides .

===Using Bézout&#x27;s identity===
In modern mathematics, a common proof involves Bézout&#x27;s identity, which was unknown at Euclid&#x27;s time. Bézout&#x27;s identity states that if and are coprime integers (i.e. they share no common divisors other than 1 and −1) there exist integers and such that
:formula_1
Let and be coprime, and assume that . By Bézout&#x27;s identity, there are and such that
:formula_2
Multiply both sides by :
:formula_3
The first term on the left is divisible by , and the second term is divisible by , which by hypothesis is divisible by . Therefore their sum, , is also divisible by .

===By induction===
The following proof is inspired by Euclid&#x27;s version of Euclidean algorithm, which proceeds by using only subtractions.

Suppose that formula_4 and that and are coprime (that is, their greatest common divisor is ). One has to prove that divides . Since formula_5 there exists an integer such that

formula_6

Without loss of generality, one can suppose that , , , and are positive, since the divisibility relation is independent of the signs of the involved integers.

To prove the theorem by strong induction, we suppose that it has been proved for all smaller values of . There are three cases:

# If , coprimality implies , and divides trivially.
# If , then subtracting formula_7 from both sides gives formula_8Thus, divides . Since we assumed that and are coprime, it follows that and must be coprime. (If not, their greatest common divisor would divide their sum as well as , contradicting our assumption.) The conclusion therefore follows by induction hypothesis, since .
#If then subtracting formula_9 from both sides gives formula_10Thus, divides . Since (as in the previous case), and are coprime, and since , then the induction hypothesis implies that divides ; that is, formula_11 for some integer . So, formula_12 and, by dividing by , one has formula_13 Therefore, formula_14 and by dividing by , one gets formula_15 the desired conclusion.

=== Proof of &quot;Elements&quot; ===
Euclid&#x27;s lemma is proved at the Proposition 30 in Book VII of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. The original proof is difficult to understand as is, so we quote the commentary from .

;Proposition 19
:If four numbers be proportional, the number produced from the first and fourth is equal to the number produced from the second and third; and, if the number produced from the first and fourth be equal to that produced from the second and third, the four numbers are proportional.
;Proposition 20
:The least numbers of those that have the same ratio with them measures those that have the same ratio the same number of times—the greater the greater and the less the less.
;Proposition 21
:Numbers prime to one another are the least of those that have the same ratio with them.
;Proposition 29
:Any prime number is prime to any number it does not measure.
;Proposition 30
:If two numbers, by multiplying one another, make the same number, and any prime number measures the product, it also measures one of the original numbers.
;Proof of 30
:If &quot;c&quot;, a prime number, measure &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;c&quot; measures either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;.Suppose &quot;c&quot; does not measure &quot;a&quot;.Therefore &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot; are prime to one another. ［VII. 29］Suppose &quot;ab&quot;＝&quot;mc&quot;.Therefore &quot;c&quot; : &quot;a&quot; ＝ &quot;b&quot; : &quot;m&quot;. ［VII. 19］Hence ［VII. 20, 21］ &quot;b&quot;＝&quot;nc&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is some integer.Therefore &quot;c&quot; measures &quot;b&quot;.Similarly, if &quot;c&quot; does not measure &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; measures &quot;a&quot;.Therefore &quot;c&quot; measures one or other of the two numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;.Q.E.D.

<text>The Battle of the Colline Gate, fought on 1 November 82 BC, was the decisive battle of the civil war between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Marians, Samnites and Lucanians. Sulla won the battle at the northeastern end of Rome, near the Colline Gate, and secured control of Italy. Appian is the only source who provides details about the battle.

The next day Sulla ordered the slaughter of the Marian leaders and Samnite prisoners in the Villa Publica. On 3 November, he started the proscription of his enemies.

==Prelude==
In spring of 83 BC Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix had returned to Italy at the head of a battle-hardened veteran army fresh from his victory over king Mithridates of Pontus in the First Mithridatic War. During 83–82 BC he and his allies had defeated the government&#x27;s forces in several major battles. With their allies on the brink of disaster the Samnites and the Lucanians, who feared they would be next, decided to join the fray. The Samnite leader Pontius Telesinus rallied an army of 70,000 men from his own people and their allies (among others the Lucanians) and marched to raise the siege of Praeneste and rescue consul Gaius Marius, who was considered the heart of the anti-Sullan cause.

Breaking the siege of Praeneste turned out to be nigh impossible. Sulla and his veteran army had dug themselves in behind formidable earthworks around the city. Telesinus, a highly experienced soldier, swiftly changed objectives and took his army on a night march towards Rome.

When Sulla found out the Samnites were moving on Rome he sent his cavalry ahead to hinder them while he himself force-marched his army to the capital. The Samnite army arrived first, at daybreak, causing a lot of consternation in the city. After the first shock wore off the Romans sent out a cavalry force to delay the attackers. Unfortunately for the Romans, the battle-hardened Samnites easily dispatched the cavalry attack, killing many of them. However, the delay did allow a cavalry detachment sent ahead by Sulla to catch their breath, organize, and begin harassing the enemy. The arrival of Sulla&#x27;s cavalry proved to the Romans and Samnites alike that Sulla was on his way. Telesinus decided to wait for Sulla&#x27;s arrival and deployed his army slightly away from the Colline Gate. Sulla&#x27;s main army arrived at noon and set up camp near to the temple of Venus Erucina, outside the walls of Rome, not far from the Colline Gate.

::Since Hannibal had made his camp within the third milestone [from Rome] the city had faced no greater danger than when Telesinus went from rank to rank of his army saying: &#x27;Now the Romans face their last day.&#x27; Loudly he exhorted his army to defeat the Romans and destroy their city saying: &#x27;These are the wolves who have been tearing at the liberty of Italy. They will never go away until we have cut down the wood that shelters them.&#x27; 
::::Velleius Patercullus, &quot;History&quot;, 2.27.

==Battle==
Sulla&#x27;s commanders were concerned by the state of his soldiers after their forced march. They pointed out that they were not up against the disorganized Marians, whom they had easily beat time and again, but against the Samnites and Lucanians − highly motivated, experienced, and warlike opponents. They urged Sulla to wait and let his soldiers recuperate over night. But Sulla only allowed his men a meal and a few hours rest. Then he organized his battle lines, and at four o&#x27;clock, with the sun already sinking, the battle began.

After a lot of hard fighting, Sulla&#x27;s left wing was driven backwards until they literally had their backs to the wall. The rearmost ranks tried to seek shelter inside the walls, but the soldiers manning the walls dropped the portcullis on them and forced them to fight on. Sulla rode over to his left wing and tried to recover the situation; he pleaded with his men, he threatened some, he even physically turned some round to face the enemy. The ranks he was trying to keep were shattered with heavy casualties. Eventually, Sulla and the bulk of the left ended up in their camp. That is when messengers arrived from Marcus Licinius Crassus who had taken command of the right wing while Sulla gave his full attention to the left. Crassus reported that his men had completely routed the enemy facing them. He wanted to know if he could have supplies now to break for supper. Sulla used Crassus&#x27; victory to boost the morale of his men and counter-attacked the Samnites.

The battle continued through the night. Pontius Telesinus, the Samnite commander, was killed and his camp was seized. Marcus Lamponius, the Lucanian commander, fled. Eventually, the entire enemy army broke and fled. The death toll was estimated at 50,000. There were 6,000–8,000 prisoners.

==Aftermath==
Marcius and Carrinas were captured and brought in the next day. Sulla killed them. He sent his lieutenant, Lucretius, to show their heads before the walls of Praeneste (Palestrina), where Gaius Marius the Younger was besieged. Velleius Paterculus wrote that Sulla ordered the head of Telesinus to be carried around the walls of Praeneste fixed on top of a spear. He did not mention Marcius and Carrinas.

The people of Praeneste understood that the Marian army had been destroyed and that Sulla controlled Italy. They surrendered. Marius hid in a tunnel and committed suicide. His head was cut off and displayed in Rome. Some senators who had held command under Marius were killed by Sulla when he reached Praeneste and some were imprisoned. The inhabitants were divided into Romans, Samnites, and Praenestians. Then a herald told the Romans that they deserved to die but they were pardoned. The men of the other two groups were killed. Norba, a town which still resisted, was taken by treachery. The inhabitants strangled themselves with ropes or fell on each other&#x27;s swords. Others set fire to the town.

<text>Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League ( ABGL) (also called All India Gorkha League (AIGL/IGL)) is a political party working amongst the Nepali-speaking Gorkha population in Darjeeling District and Kalimpong District of West Bengal, India. The party was founded in 1943 by Damber Singh Gurung.

ABGL is currently part of an alliance of BJP, GNLF, CPRM and other parties with Pratap Khati as its convenor. ABGL stands for peaceful democracy in the Darjeeling hills. It advocates for a full-fledged state of Gorkhaland.

Ahead of the 1999 DGHC elections, ABGL was part of the United Front, an alliance consisting of Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists, ABGL, Indian National Congress, Bharatiya Gorkha Janashakti, Communist Party of India, Trinamool Congress, Bharatiya Nepali Bir Gorkha and Sikkim Rashtriya Mukti Morcha.

ABGL was later a part of the People&#x27;s Democratic Front (PDF), a six-party alliance led by CPRM and including Indian National Congress (Hills), Gorkha National Liberation Front (C.K. Pradhan), ABGL, Bharatiya Janata Party and Gorkha Democratic Front (a party that was formed by Madan Tamang before his return to ABGL). PDF stood for Gorkha autonomy but was opposed to the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) led by Subhash Ghisingh.

On 21 May 2010, ABGL president Madan Tamang was stabbed to death (allegedly by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) supporters) in Darjeeling, which led to a spontaneous shutdown in the three Darjeeling hill sub-divisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong. Subsequently his wife Bharati Tamang was elected as the ABGL president.

ABGL contested the West Bengal legislative assembly elections held on 18 April 2011 from three constituencies in the Darjeeling hills. The three candidates Bharati Tamang from Darjeeling, Tribhuwan Rai from Kalimpong and Shiva Kumar Pradhan from Kurseong all lost the elections.

Due to internal fights, ABGL broke up into three factions, headed by Bharati Tamang, Pratap Khati and Laxman Pradhan, respectively. After the merger of the factions of Pratap Khati and Laxman Pradhan and the dissolution of the Bharati Tamang faction, only one ABGL headed by Pratap Khati exists today.

The flag of the ABGL consists of two equal horizontal stripes. The upper is light green and has an image of a white lotus; the lower is red with two crossed traditional Gorkha knives, called Kurkuri.

<text>In topology, the Lebesgue covering lemma is a useful tool in the study of compact metric spaces. 

Given an open cover of a compact metric space, a Lebesgue&#x27;s number of the cover is a number formula_1 such that every subset of formula_2 having diameter less than formula_3 is contained in some member of the cover.

The existence of Lebesgue&#x27;s numbers for compact metric spaces is given by the Lebesgue&#x27;s covering lemma:

:If the metric space formula_4 is compact and an open cover of formula_2 is given, then the cover admits some Lebesgue&#x27;s number formula_1.

The notion of Lebesgue&#x27;s numbers itself is useful in other applications as well.

== Proof ==

===Direct Proof===

Let formula_7 be an open cover of formula_2. Since formula_2 is compact we can extract a finite subcover formula_10.
If any one of the formula_11&#x27;s equals formula_2 then any formula_13 will serve as a Lebesgue&#x27;s number.
Otherwise for each formula_14, let formula_15, note that formula_16 is not empty, and define a function formula_17 by

: formula_18

Since formula_19 is continuous on a compact set, it attains a minimum formula_3. 
The key observation is that, since every formula_21 is contained in some formula_11, the extreme value theorem shows formula_1. Now we can verify that this formula_3 is the desired Lebesgue&#x27;s number.
If formula_25 is a subset of formula_2 of diameter less than formula_3, choose formula_28 as any point in formula_25, then by definition of diameter, formula_30, where formula_31 denotes the ball of radius formula_3 centered at formula_28. Since formula_34 there must exist at least one formula_35 such that formula_36. But this means that formula_37 and so, in particular, formula_38.

===Proof by Contradiction===

Suppose for contradiction that formula_2 is sequentially compact, formula_40 is an open cover of formula_2, and the Lebesgue number formula_3 does not exist. That is: for all formula_1, there exists formula_44 with formula_45 such that there does not exist formula_46 with formula_47.

This enables us to perform the following construction:

formula_48

formula_49

formula_50 

formula_51

formula_50 
Note that formula_53 for all formula_54, since formula_55. It is therefore possible by the axiom of choice to construct a sequence formula_56 in which formula_57 for each formula_35. Since formula_2 is sequentially compact, there exists a subsequence formula_60 (with formula_61) that converges to formula_62. 

Because formula_63 is an open cover, there exists some formula_64 such that formula_65. As formula_66 is open, there exists formula_67 with formula_68. Now we invoke the convergence of the subsequence formula_69: there exists formula_70 such that
formula_71 implies formula_72. 

Furthermore, there exists formula_73 such that formula_74. Hence for all formula_75, we have formula_76 implies formula_77.

Finally, define formula_78 such that formula_79 and formula_80. For all formula_81, notice that:
*formula_82, because formula_79.
*formula_84, because formula_80 entails formula_86.

Hence formula_87 by the triangle inequality, which implies that formula_88. This yields the desired contradiction.

<doc id="826659" wikidata="Q4164559" url="?curid=826659" title="Saqifa">
<text>The Saqifa () of the Banu Sa&#x27;ida clan refers to the location of an event in early Islam where some of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr as the first caliph and successor to Muhammad shortly after his death in 11 AH (632 CE). The Saqifa meeting is among the most controversial events in early Islam, due to the exclusion of a large number of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, including his immediate family and notably Ali, his cousin and son-in-law. The conflicts that arose soon after Muhammad&#x27;s death are considered to be the main cause of the current division among Muslims. Those who accepted Abu Bakr&#x27;s caliphate were later labeled Sunnis, while the supporters of Ali&#x27;s right to caliphate were later labeled Shia.

== Historiography ==
The Arabic word denotes a covered communal place for conversation but the term is synonymous in historical texts with the specific meeting immediately after Muhammad&#x27;s death in which his succession was debated. 

=== Biased reports ===
The earliest reports about the Saqifa affair were put into writing in the first half of the second century AH or later. By this time, the Muslim community was already firmly divided into Sunni and Shia camps. As a result, the reports of the Sunni Ibn Sa&#x27;d (), al-Baladhuri (), and even al-Tabari () reflect the Sunni beliefs, while those authors with Shia sympathies favored their views, including Ibn Ishaq (), al-Ya&#x27;qubi (), and al-Mas&#x27;udi (). Jafri thus emphasizes the need for surveying all reports to obtain a sound account of the event.

For instance, Ibn Sa&#x27;d presents a highly polemic account of the Saqifa affair in his &quot;Kitab al-Tabaqat al-kabir&quot;, where Ali is absent in particular. Jafri regards him as a pioneer of the Sunni &quot;pious&quot; technique, which preserves only the best qualities of companions and suppresses any controversial reports. Similarly, the late works of the Shia al-Tabarsi () and al-Majlesi () are polemic in nature with little historical value, claims Jafri.

=== Centrality of Ibn Ishaq ===
The earliest report is that of Ibn Ishaq in his &quot;Sirat rasul Allah&quot;, the recension of which by the Sunni Ibn Hisham () has reached us. Uncharacteristically, Ibn Hisham refrains from modifying Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account of the Saqifa affair, which is thus a report written by a Shia author and approved by a Sunni editor-critic. Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account is the basis of the contemporary studies of Jafri and Madelung. 

=== Other authors ===
In his &quot;Ansab al-ashraf&quot;, the Sunni al-Baladhuri partly follows Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s pious technique but also retains some of the controversial material about the Saqifa event in favor of Ali. On the other hand, the contentious content in the work of the Shia al-Ya&#x27;qubi is often dismissed by later Sunni authors as fabricated, while Jafri views his work as a valuable collection of documents which survived the tendentious efforts of the Sunni majority historians, who largely suppressed or dismissed divergent views. Madelung similarly believes that the Shia or Sunni partiality of a report alone does not imply its fabrication. The account of the Saqifa meeting by al-Tabari is mostly balanced and unbiased, notes Jafri, and the most detailed, writes Ayoub (). 

=== Ibn Abbas ===
The main narrator of the Saqifa event is Ibn Abbas (), Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and an authority in Medina&#x27;s scholarly circles. He witnessed the event himself and also received the first-hand account of his father Abbas, who was politically active then. Madelung accepts the authenticity of Ibn Abbas&#x27; narration, noting that it reflects his characteristic view point. The bulk of Ibn Abbas&#x27; narration concerns a Friday sermon by Umar in 23/644. Though this is omitted from most Sunni reports, Madelung and Jafri are confident that the second caliph delivered the speech to discourage those who might have planned to back Ali&#x27;s nomination as caliph after Umar. 

== Event ==

During Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, Muslims in Medina were divided into two groups: the Muhajirun, who had converted to Islam in Mecca and migrated to Medina with Muhammad, and the Ansar, who were originally from Medina and had invited Muhammad to govern their city.

=== Ansar&#x27;s meeting ===
In the immediate aftermath of Muhammad&#x27;s death in 11/632, a gathering of the Ansar took place at the Saqifa () of the Banu Sa&#x27;ida clan, while his close relatives prepared for the burial. The conventional wisdom is that the Ansar met there to decide on a new leader for the Muslim community among themselves, with the intentional exclusion of the Muhajirun. This is also what Umar stated in his speech. The leading candidate was possibly Sa&#x27;d ibn Ubada, a companion of Muhammad and a chief of the Banu Khazraj, the majority tribe of the Ansar, who was sick on that day.

For Madelung, the absence of the Muhajirun instead indicates that the Ansar met to re-establish their control over Medina under the belief that the Muhajirun would mostly return to Mecca after Muhammad. Alternatively, Jafri suspects that the Ansar met preemptively because they were fearful of Meccan domination and possibly aware of their designs for leadership.

=== Abu Bakr at the Saqifa ===
Among three available traditions, Jafri chooses the one that appears in nearly all of his sources, according to which the news of the Saqifa meeting reached Abu Bakr, Umar, and Abu Ubaida when they were most likely in the house of Abu Ubaida, possibly to discuss the leadership crisis. Arnold and Jafri are confident that Abu Bakr and Umar had earlier planned or formed an alliance in anticipation of Muhammad&#x27;s death, while Madelung attributes the planning only to Abu Bakr. In Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s report, someone then informs Abu Bakr and Umar about the Saqifa meeting, &quot;If you want to have command of the people, then take it before their [the Ansar&#x27;s] action becomes serious.&quot; The two then rushed to the Saqifa, accompanied by Abu Ubaida, perhaps to prevent any unexpected development. Some encouraged the three men not to do so but they pressed on anyway, reports Umar.

Umar narrates that &quot;the Muhajirun&quot; joined Abu Bakr, and then Umar suggested they go to the Ansar gathered at the Saqifa. Madelung rejects this, noting that Abu Bakr, Umar, and Abu Ubaida were the only members of the Muhajirun in the Saqifa meeting, possibly accompanied by a few relatives and clients. For Madelung, the near absence of the Muhajirun at the Saqifa also explains why there are no other reports about the event, arguing that the Ansar must have been reluctant to recount their defeat later.

=== Abu Bakr&#x27;s remarks ===
Once there, Umar says he &quot;realized that they [the Ansar] intended to cut us off from our root [i.e., the Quraysh] and to usurp the rule from us.&quot; Abu Bakr then rose and warned the Ansar that Arabs will not recognize the rule of anyone outside of Muhammad&#x27;s tribe, the Quraysh. The Muhajirun, Abu Bakr argued, were the best of Arabs in lineage and location, as quoted by Ibn Ishaq. Abu Bakr also noted that the Muhajirun had accepted Islam earlier and were closer to Muhammad in kinship, adds al-Baladhuri. The Quraysh&#x27;s relation with Muhammad is also noted by al-Ya&#x27;qubi and al-Tabari, and also by the contemporary Momen. Madelung, however, considers it unlikely that Abu Bakr brought up the Quraysh&#x27;s kinship with Muhammad as that would have invited questions about the rights of the Banu Hashim, Muhammad&#x27;s clan and his closest kin. 

Returning to Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account, Abu Bakr then reportedly invited the Ansar to choose Umar or Abu Ubaida as Muhammad&#x27;s successor. Umar reports that he was displeased with this offer because he considered Abu Bakr to be more entitled to rulership than himself. Madelung regards this as a manoeuvre by Abu Bakr to present himself as an acceptable alternative to Umar and Abu Ubaida for the Ansar, adding that Abu Ubaida lacked prominence while Umar had apparently just discredited himself before the meeting by publicly denying Muhammad&#x27;s death.

=== Violence at the Saqifa ===
Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account continues that Habab ibn Mundhir, a veteran of the Battle of Badr, countered Abu Bakr with the suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar should choose their separate rulers among themselves. A heated argument then followed, reports Umar, until he asked Abu Bakr to stretch his hand and pledged allegiance to him. Others followed suit, he claims, adding that, &quot;Then we jumped upon Sa&#x27;d until one of them called out: &#x27;You killed Sa&#x27;d ibn Ubada.&#x27; I said, &#x27;May God kill Sa&#x27;d.&#x27;&quot; 

The outburst of violence at the Saqifa indicates that a substantial number of the Ansar must have initially refused to follow Umar&#x27;s lead, writes Madelung. Otherwise, he argues, there would have been no need to beat up their chief Sa&#x27;d ibn Ubada. Sa&#x27;d remained defiant until his murder by a &quot;jinn&quot; during the reign of Umar, possibly at the instigation of the second caliph.

== Ali ==

=== Absence from the Saqifa ===
Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law was preparing Muhammad&#x27;s body for burial, alongside other close relatives, and was likely unaware of the ongoing Saqifa meeting. Following Umar&#x27;s pledge to Abu Bakr, the Saqifa account of the Kufan al-Nakha&#x27;i () adds, &quot;But the Ansar, or some of them, said: &#x27;We will not swear allegiance to anyone but Ali.&#x27;&quot; Caetani dismisses this report because of its Shia coloring, while Madelung accepts it, noting that al-Nakha&#x27;i is not known for Shia sympathies and his account is otherwise distinctly Sunni. Similarly, al-Ya&#x27;qubi writes that the Ansar al-Mundhir ibn Arqam interrupted the proceedings and nominated Ali for succession. The contemporary Jafri, Lalani, and Momen state that some advocated the case of Ali at the Saqifa.

Madelung is not certain whether the succession of Ali was discussed at the Saqifa but considers it likely, commenting that the Ansar would have naturally turned to Ali because of their family ties with the prophet. Umar in his sermon explained that they had pressed the Ansar for an immediate oath of allegiance at the Saqifa because, he claimed, they might have had otherwise elected one of their own to succeed Muhammad. Referring to this claim, Madelung suggests that Umar was partly fearful that the Ansar would put forward the case of Ali among themselves. This is also a proposal entertained by McHugo.

=== The case for Ali ===
Madelung is of the view that a broad , in which Ali was to be on option, would have led to the election of Ali: The Ansar would have supported Ali because of their family ties with Muhammad. Among the Muhajirun, the candidacy of Ali would have likely been supported by the powerful Abd Shams clan of the Quraysh because of their close ties with the Banu Hashim and despite their conflicts. Their chief Abu Sufyan indeed offered his support to Ali after the appointment of Abu Bakr, but was turned down by Ali who said he was concerned about the unity of the nascent Islam. The joint support of the Ansar and Abd Shams would have carried Ali to the caliphate, conjectures Madelung. He adds that the straightforward logic of dynastic succession would have likely prevailed in a general in favor of Ali&quot;.&quot; Some others similarly consider it likely that Ali would have been elected in a formal assembly.

==== Merits ====
In terms of merits, the same arguments that favored Abu Bakr over the Ansar (kinship, service to Islam, lineage, etc.) would have likely favored Ali over Abu Bakr, as often evoked by Shia authors in support of Ali&#x27;s right to succession. For Jafri, the Sunni arguments that justify Abu Bakr&#x27;s caliphate on the basis that he led the prayer in Muhammad&#x27;s final days reflect later theological developments. He also finds the related traditions to be confused and contradictory. In the same vein, Lecomte writes that Muhammad respected Abu Bakr but considers the prayer story inconclusive because it does not formally relate to the political leadership of the community. Shaban goes further and assigns no significance to the prayer story, saying that Muhammad had frequently delegated this task to others in the past.

==== Youth ====
A common argument by Sunni and Western scholars is that the young Ali, aged about thirty at the time, could have not been a serious candidate for the caliphate. This is the view of Veccia Vaglieri, Lammens, and also Shaban, who suggests that Ali was untried for the responsibility. In contrast, Aslan argues that Ali regularly took key responsibilities despite his youth when Muhammad was alive. Alternatively, Madelung argues that Ali&#x27;s youth would have only mattered if there had been an agreement on the hereditary succession to Muhammad.

==== In the Quran ====

Families of the past prophets are given a prominent role in the Quran. After the past prophets, their kin are selected by God as the spiritual and material heirs to the prophets in the Quran. Muhammad&#x27;s family (Ahl al-Bayt) similarly enjoys an eminent position in the Quran. As such, insofar as the Quran reflects the views of Muhammad, Madelung argues that he could have not seen his succession differently from the past prophets or considered Abu Bakr as his natural successor. Jafri develops a similar line of argument. This is also the Shia view.

=== Ali&#x27;s views ===
Veccia Vaglieri is uncertain whether Ali actually hoped to succeed Muhammad because he made no effort in Sunni sources to seize the rule, despite being advised to do so by Abbas and Abu Sufyan. Alternatively, Ayoub describes the mild opposition of Ali in Sunni sources as apologetic. He and some others maintain that Ali viewed himself as the most qualified person to lead the Muslim community after Muhammad by virtue of his merits and his kinship with Muhammad. These authors argue that Ali eventually relinquished his claims to the caliphate for the sake of the unity of a nascent Islam in crisis when it became clear that Muslims did not broadly support his cause. Had the Muslim community favored Ali, Madelung suggests, he would have no longer considered the caliphate just as his right, but also as his duty. Indeed, in speeches and letters attributed to Ali, it is repeatedly emphasized that the leadership of the Muslim community is the prerogative of the family of Muhammad (Ahl al-Bayt). 

Mavani, Madelung, and Shah-Kazemi add that Ali further considered himself as the designated successor of Muhammad through a divine decree at the Ghadir Khumm. Ayoub disagrees, but concedes that Ali and some others indeed considered him as the most qualified to lead. To support his claims, Madelung cites a Sunni statement attributed to Ali when he pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr after a long delay. He also notes that Ali publicly referred to the Ghadir Khumm after his ascension to the caliphate in 656. Mavani similarly cites some Sunni and Shia reports, including the proceedings of the electoral council in 644 when Ali refused to be bound by the precedence of the first two caliphs. Another report by al-Tabari indicates that Ali again publicly excluded the practices of Abu Bakr and Umar from the Sunna (of Muhammad) when his supporters pledged their allegiance to him in Kufa. 

Madelung holds that Ali&#x27;s views about succession mostly match the Shia beliefs today, and Lalani and Daftary have similar opinions, whereas Veccia Vaglieri considers Shia beliefs to be fabricated because Ali &quot;showed no inclination to legitimism.&quot; By contrast, some others detail the public opposition of Ali to the appointment of Abu Bakr at the Saqifa. Even though Ali most likely did not give up his claims to the caliphate, it seems that he accepted the first three caliphs as administrators and rulers. Indeed, Madelung highlights some Sunni hadiths, according to which Ali praised Abu Bakr and Umar, while some others note the Sunni tendency to minimize and neutralize the conflicts among companions after Muhammad, particularly about the Saqifa affair. In and some other early Shia sources, Ali contrasts the corruption of the third caliph, Uthman, with the political leadership of Abu Bakr and Umar, even though he rejects their religious legitimacy. A related example is the account of the negotiations before the Battle of Siffin (657) by Ibn Muzahim (), which quotes Ali as saying that Abu Bakr and Umar had governed justly, even though they had assumed the caliphate wrongfully. Mavani and Maria M. Dakake suggest that Ali viewed the succession of Abu Bakr as a digression which turned into a full-blown deviation with the rebellion of Mu&#x27;awiya during his own caliphate. This is also the Shia view, as represented by the Shia jurist Ruhollah Khomeini (). 

== Tribal politics ==

=== Banu Aws ===
A question can be raised as to what enabled a handful of the Muhajirun to force their will upon the Ansar at the Saqifa. Ibn Ishaq and Caetani attribute this to an earlier collusion between the Muhajirun and the Banu Aws, the rival tribe of the Banu Khazraj among the Ansar. Madelung rejects this as unlikely but suggests that Usaid ibn Hudair, a chief of the Banu Aws, must have backed Abu Bakr at the Saqifa and carried with him the majority of the Aws, as also apparent from a related report by al-Tabari. Jafri likewise suggests that the deep-rooted enmity between the minority Banu Aws and the majority Banu Khazraj made it preferable for the former to instead submit to the Qurayshite rule. Momen has a similar opinion, and Ayoub regards the rivalry between the Banu Khazraj and the Banu Aws as the decisive factor in the appointment of Abu Bakr, who reportedly reminded the Ansar about this rivalry in the Saqifa account of the Sunni al-Jahiz (), thus rekindling their pre-Islamic conflict, according to Ayoub. 

=== Banu Khazraj ===
The position of the Banu Khazraj was further weakened by internal rivalries, particularly between their chief Sa&#x27;d ibn Ubada and his cousin Bashr ibn Sa&#x27;d. The latter was among the first to break ranks and support Abu Bakr. Once an agreement over Abu Bakr was nearly reached, Jafri believes that the Khazraj found it unwise to lag behind and risk losing favor with the new ruler. 

=== Banu Taym ===
Jafri suggests that the rivalries among the larger clans within the Muhajirun made it easier for them to accept the rule of Abu Bakr, who belonged to the small clan of Banu Taym.

=== Banu Aslam ===
Madelung and Caetani both hold that a decisive factor for Abu Bakr was the timely arrival of the Banu Aslam tribe in Medina with great numbers that filled the streets of Medina. The Banu Aslam tribe were known for their hostility towards the Ansar and readily supported Abu Bakr&#x27;s bid for power. Umar would often point out, &quot;It was only when I saw the Banu Aslam that I became certain of [our] victory.&quot; It is not known today whether this happened by chance or the Banu Aslam were tipped off about the Ansar&#x27;s ambitions. 

=== Banu Hashim ===

==== Jealousy ====
Muhammad&#x27;s clan, the Banu Hashim, and particularly his notable uncle Abbas supported the succession of Ali. Aslan suggests that the exclusion of Ali from the Saqifa affair was deliberate and reflected the fear among the Quraysh that combining the prophethood and the caliphate in the Banu Hashim would have made them too powerful. A conversation to this effect between the Hashemite Ibn Abbas and Umar is cited by Momen and Madelung. The former author voices a similar view to Aslan, while the latter acknowledges the &quot;jealousy of the Quraysh,&quot; but believes that the simple logic of dynastic succession would have nevertheless prevailed in a broad in favor of Ali. For Keaney, the Meccan elite were concerned that Ali&#x27;s caliphate would have kept the future leadership of the community out of their hands and within the Banu Hashim.

==== Hereditary succession ====
Lammens believes that Arabs disliked hereditary leadership while Madelung limits this attitude to Bedouin Arabs. Among the Quraysh, he argues, hereditary leadership was not uncommon, reflecting their belief that noble qualities were inherited. This view is echoed by Aslan. Afsaruddin and Sharon maintain that kinship was not a factor in early Islam whereas Amir-Moezzi and Mavani have challenged this point. In particular, Mavani writes that tribal values were deeply entrenched in the Arab society of that time, according to which kinship and noble lineage were the primary marks of identity and source of authority. Keaney believes that leadership was hereditary in the traditional Arab society and something that ran in families in a broad sense of the word. Lewis () says that the Arab tradition was to choose the from a single family. However, Ali was Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law which, he claims, carries little weight.
Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham narrate that Umar in his speech famously said, &quot;The oath of allegiance for Abu Bakr was a [i.e., a precipitate and ill-considered deal], but God averted the evil of it.&quot; Alternatively, the Sunni al-Baladhuri quotes Umar in his &quot;Ansab&quot; as saying, &quot;By God, the oath of allegiance for Abu Bakr was no ,&quot; adding that Muhammad had already designated Abu Bakr as his successor. In another narration by al-Baladhuri, Umar calls it a lie that the Saqifa affair was a . Madelung rejects both of the reports by al-Baladhuri as highly unlikely.

=== Legitimacy ===
Madelung suspects that Umar considered the Saqifa affair a because it excluded from decision making the majority of the Muhajirun and particularly Muhammad&#x27;s kin, whose participation was vital for a legitimate outcome. Possibly because of its questionable legal authority, Umar also warned Muslims in his speech against ever following the example of Saqifa. Similar concerns are raised by Abbas and Momen. Walker adds that Muhammad&#x27;s relatives were disgruntled by Abu Bakr&#x27;s hasty appointment which denied them a voice in the matter. 

Jafri notes the prominence of Abu Bakr but comments that his appointment was the decision of a group of companions, hastily forced upon others, and its success was due to the delicate group conflicts in Medina. Some contemporary authors have further criticized the Saqifa affair as a &quot;backroom deal&quot; and a &quot;coup&quot; which was heavily influenced by the pre-Islamic tribal politics. The evil of the &quot;&quot; which, Umar thought, had been averted by God would erupt later in the form of the First Fitna, suggests Madelung.

==Consolidation==
Umar in his sermon asserted that &quot;the necks of all Muslims were stretched [in obedience] for Abu Bakr,&quot; though Madelung considers it more likely that his authority was highly precarious at first. After the Saqifa meeting, Abu Bakr reportedly headed to the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque and gave his inaugural speech there. Abbas and Hazleton comment that Muhammad was already buried by this time, with the exclusion of Abu Bakr from the funeral rites. With the help of the Banu Aslam and Banu Aws tribes, Umar is then said to have dominated the streets to secure the pledges of allegiance from the Medinans, according to Madelung. In chronological order, Abu Bakr obtained the backing of Uthman and of the Banu Umayyad, of Sa&#x27;d and Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, of the Banu Zuhra, of Zubayr, and finally of Ali. 

=== Ali&#x27;s opposition ===
Al-Baladhuri reports that the Banu Hashim and some companions gathered at Ali&#x27;s house after learning about the appointment of Abu Bakr. Among them were Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas and Zubayr. These protesters held that Ali was the rightful successor to Muhammad, possibly referring to Muhammad&#x27;s announcement at Ghadir Khumm. Miqdad, Salman, Abu Dharr, Talha were also among the companions who supported Ali&#x27;s cause.

==== Threats against Ali ====
Abu Bakr is said to have tasked Umar with securing Ali&#x27;s pledge of allegiance. As noted by al-Tabari,&#x27; the latter then led an armed mob to Ali&#x27;s residence and threatened to set the house on fire if Ali and his supporters would not pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr.&#x27; The scene soon grew violent, but the mob retreated without Ali&#x27;s pledge after his wife Fatima pleaded with them, as reported in the Sunni &quot;al-Imama wa al-siyasa.&quot; Alternatively, al-Baladhuri states that Ali capitulated and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr immediately after Umar&#x27;s threat. In contrast, the canonical &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; and &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; relate that Ali pledged to Abu Bakr after Fatima died sometime later. 

==== Boycott of Ali ====
Madelung believes that Abu Bakr later placed a boycott on Ali and also on the Banu Hashim to abandon their support for Ali. As a result, prominent men ceased to speak to Ali, as related in a Sunni hadith attributed to Aisha. Those who initially supported Ali gradually turned away and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr, adds Jafri. At the same time, Ali turned down proposals to advance his claims by force, possibly for the unity of a nascent Islam. 

==== Attack on Ali&#x27;s house and his pledge ====
While there is considerable uncertainty about the events, Ali most likely did not pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr until his wife Fatima died within six months of her father Muhammad, as reported by some canonical Sunni works. In Shia sources, the death (and miscarriage) of the young Fatima are attributed to an attack on her house to subdue Ali at the order of Abu Bakr. Sunnis categorically reject these allegations. After Fatima&#x27;s death and in the absence of popular support, Ali is said to have relinquished his claims to the caliphate for the sake of the unity of a nascent Islam, which was facing internal and external threats, according to Mavani. In contrast with Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, Ali is believed to have retired from public life during the caliphates of Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, which has been interpreted as a silent censure of the first three caliphs. While he reputedly advised Abu Bakr and Umar on government and religious matters, the mutual distrust and hostility of Ali with the two caliphs is well-documented, but largely downplayed or ignored in Sunni sources. Their differences were epitomized during the proceedings of the electoral council in 644 when Ali refused to be bound by the precedence of the first two caliphs. In contrast, Shias tend to view Ali&#x27;s pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr as a (coerced) act of political expediency or , thus rejecting that Ali ever pledged. The charge that Ali pledged to Abu Bakr under duress appears also in &quot;al-Imama wa al-siyasa&quot;, sometimes attributed to Ibn Qutaybah () but possibly written by another Sunni author in the Abbasid era. These conflicts after Muhammad&#x27;s death are considered as the roots of the current division among Muslims. Those who accepted Abu Bakr&#x27;s caliphate were later labeled Sunnis, while the supporters of Ali&#x27;s right to caliphate went on to form the Shia.

The book depicts the three days of the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, and the days leading up to it: June 29, 1863, as the troops of both the Union and the Confederacy move into battle around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and July 1, July 2, and July 3, when the battle was fought. The story is character-driven and told from the perspective of various historical figures from both the Confederacy and the Union. A film adaptation of the novel, titled &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, was released in 1993.

==Plot==
===Title===
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, one of the major characters, remembers reciting to his father a speech from &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;What a piece of work is man...in action how like an angel!&quot; Sgt. Buster Kilrain says: Well, if he&#x27;s an angel, all right then...But he damn well must be a killer angel.

&quot;And the old man, grinning, had scratched his head and then said stiffly, &#x27;Well, boy, if he&#x27;s an angel, he&#x27;s sure a murderin&#x27; angel.&#x27; And Chamberlain had gone on to school to make an oration on the subject: Man, the Killer Angel.&quot;

===Summary===
In late June 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee leads his army into Pennsylvania. By threatening Washington, D.C., he hopes to draw the Union army into battle and inflict a crushing defeat, which will bring an end to the war. Harrison, a spy, tells General James Longstreet, Lee&#x27;s friend, that the Union army is drawing near. They go to Lee, who is reluctant to trust a spy, but has to, because his usual source of intelligence, Jeb Stuart&#x27;s cavalry, is out of touch. He sets out to meet the enemy.

At the road junction of Gettysburg, Confederate infantry encounters the Union cavalry of General John Buford who seizes the high ground and holds it against a Confederate attack at dawn on July 1. Troops of General John Reynolds come to support Buford. Reynolds is killed and the Union troops are pushed back, but at nightfall they entrench on high ground while the Confederates celebrate what appears to them to be another in a long line of victories for General Lee.

Longstreet is filled with foreboding. On July 2, he tries to persuade Lee that the Union position, entrenched on steep hills and behind stone walls is too strong. He urges Lee to march away and make the fight on more favorable ground. But Lee orders a flanking attack on the Union position. Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of Maine is told by his superiors that he occupies the end of the Union line, and that he must hold at any cost. In a brilliant, costly action, Chamberlain succeeds in repulsing the Confederate attack.

On July 3, Lee, concluding that his flanking attack was repulsed due to the Union army&#x27;s focus on them, concludes that &quot;they are weak in the center&quot; and orders a frontal assault on the center of the Union line. Knowing it is doomed, Longstreet argues against it, as his men will be forced to march across an open field under cannon fire to assault the well-entrenched Union center. But Lee is confident and Longstreet despairs. General George Pickett leads the charge, which is turned back with heavy losses. A shaken Lee orders retreat. Chamberlain is now confident of Union victory.

===Layout===
Beginning with the famous section about Longstreet&#x27;s spy, Henry Thomas Harrison, gathering information about the movements and positions of the Federals, each day is told primarily from the perspectives of commanders of the two armies, including Robert E. Lee and James Longstreet for the Confederacy, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and John Buford for the Union. Most chapters describe the emotion-laden decisions of these officers as they went into battle. Maps depicting the positioning of the troops as they went to battle, as they advanced, add to the sense of authenticity as decisions are made to advance and retreat with the armies. The author also uses the story of Gettysburg, the largest battle in the history of North America, to relate the causes of the Civil War and the motivations that led old friends to face each other on the battlefield.

==Publication==
Publication of &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and release of the movie have had two significant influences on modern perceptions of the Civil War. First, the actions of Chamberlain and the 20th Maine Infantry on Little Round Top have achieved enormous public awareness. Visitors touring the Gettysburg Battlefield rank the 20th Maine monument as their most important stop. Second, since Shaara used the memoirs of General James Longstreet as a prime source for his history, the book has renewed the modern re-evaluation of Longstreet&#x27;s reputation, damaged since the 1870s by the Lost Cause writers, such as Jubal A. Early.

==Literary significance==
General H. Norman Schwarzkopf described &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; as &quot;the best and most realistic historical novel about war that I have ever read.&quot; The filmmaker Ken Burns has mentioned the influence of the book in developing his interest in the Civil War and his subsequent production of the PBS series on the subject. The book has also been cited by Joss Whedon as the original inspiration for his science fiction/Western hybrid series &quot;Firefly&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviews of &quot;Killer Angels&quot; are generally favorable. 

One review noted:
...history must be made palatable. Not inaccurate, not exaggerated, but palatable. And &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; makes history palatable. &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; was published more than one hundred years after the Battle of Gettysburg…and in just a few short years sold more than two and a half million copies! Why? Because it describes Civil War combat as no other book ever has: vividly, graphically, and accurately. Because it takes the reader into the minds and hearts of the soldiers, to know their thoughts and feel their emotions, to know their ideas and ideals, their fears and frustrations, their dedication, their courage, their sense of duty. Because it tells the story from both sides and, therefore, appeals to both sides. 
==Awards and nominations==
&quot;The Killer Angels&quot; received the 1975 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

&quot;The Killer Angels&quot; has been required reading, at various times, at the US Army Officer Candidate School, The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the U.S. Army War College, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Army Special Forces Detachment Officer Qualification Course, The Basic School for Marine Officers (TBS) and Saint Joseph&#x27;s University. It is one of only two novels (the other being &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; by Anton Myrer) on the U.S. Army&#x27;s recommended reading list for Officer Professional Development.

==Other media==
&quot;The Killer Angels&quot; was adapted into the 1993 movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Much of the dialogue in the movie comes directly from the book.

The &quot;Firefly&quot; science fiction television series was developed by Joss Whedon after reading &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. Homage to Shaara&#x27;s novel was paid in the series&#x27; final episode, &quot;Objects in Space&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Steve Earle included a song on his 1999 bluegrass album, &quot;The Mountain&quot;, called &quot;Dixieland&quot;, sung from the point of view of the character Buster Kilrain.

A stage adaptation by Karen Tarjan was originally produced at Lifeline Theatre in Chicago in 2004, and again in the Fall of 2013. The adaptation was subsequently produced at Anchorage Community Theatre, the Wayside Theatre in Virginia, the Heritage Theatre in Maryland, Mother Road Theatre in New Mexico, and Michigan Shakespeare Festival.

&quot;The Killer Angels&quot; was the title of the 2013 album by Swedish heavy metal artists Civil War, which included the song &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, a song about the Battle of Gettysburg.

A second stage adaptation by Brian Newell, &quot;The Killer Angels, Soldiers of Gettysburg&quot;, opened May 5, 2017 at the Maverick Theater in Fullerton California.

<doc id="826665" wikidata="Q7722640" url="?curid=826665" title="The Choirboys (band)">
<text>The Choirboys are an Australian hard rock and Australian pub rock band from Sydney formed as Choirboys in 1979 with mainstays Mark Gable on lead vocals, Ian Hulme on bass guitar, Brad Carr on lead guitar and Lindsay Tebbutt on drums. In preparation for their second album &quot;Big Bad Noise&quot; in 1988, the band changed their name to The Choirboys. The band line-up saw many changes from 1983 to 2007, while releasing 8 studio albums. Their 1987 single &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; remains their biggest commercial success.

==Career==
===Early years===
Choirboys formed in the Northern Beaches area of Sydney as a hard rock pub band in 1979. Original members were Brad Carr on lead guitar, Mark Gable on vocals, Ian Hulme on bass guitar and Lindsay Tebbutt on drums.

In 1983, after one of their demos was sent to Albert Productions record producer George Young (ex-The Easybeats, older brother of Angus and Malcolm Young of AC/DC) they signed to Albert Records. Jim Manzie produced their self-titled debut album, &quot;Choirboys&quot;, which was released in July. The first single, &quot;Never Gonna Die&quot; reached No. 30 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Australian TV and music personality Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum claimed the album was &quot;destined to become an Aussie classic&quot;. They toured as support to The Angels and Rose Tattoo and then Cold Chisel invited Choirboys to support them on their Last Stand Tour. However in November, Gable&#x27;s vocal cords had ruptured and they were unable to join that tour – they spent 1984 and 1985 in hiatus waiting for him to recover.

===1986–89: &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Big Bad Noise&quot;===
Choirboys signed with Mushroom Records and released &quot;Fireworks&quot; in May 1986, they also opened for Deep Purple on their tour of Australia. Brad Carr left the group to be replaced on lead guitar by Brett Williams (ex-Brakes) as they supported Bon Jovi&#x27;s tour in 1987. They recorded their second album &quot;Big Bad Noise&quot; with producers Peter Blyton (The Radiators, Machinations) and Brian McGee (The Rolling Stones, Cyndi Lauper). The next single &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; reached No. 3 in December 1987. Released in the United States, it appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaked at No. 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1989. &quot;Big Bad Noise&quot; peaked at No. 5 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart in April 1988 and went double platinum. It was ranked No. 21 for the year in Australia. Other singles from the album included &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; and &quot;Struggle Town&quot; reaching No. 14 and No. 34 respectively.

===1990s: &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; to &quot;Yo-Yo&quot;===
The Choirboys recorded &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, in Los Angeles with producer Marc Tanner. The album didn&#x27;t achieve the level of success of its predecessor – it peaked at No. 30. Late in the year they released a live album, &quot;Dead Drunk Live Hangovers&quot;, recorded at a Melbourne show.

Brad Heaney (ex-The Screaming Jets) replaced Tebbutt on drums and Steve Williams (Wa Wa Nee) replaced Brett Williams on guitar by 1993. Their compilation album &quot;Decade 1983–1993&quot; (1993) was followed by &quot;Dancing on the Grave of Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1994), with Barton Price (Models) on drums, which was produced by Gable and Hulme.

The band recorded its next album &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; in Germany during 1996, with Blyton and Choirboys producing and Richard Lara (The Screaming Jets) replacing Brett Williams on guitar. The band supported Cheap Trick on their Australian tour in the same year with Tony Le Rhodes on drums.

===2000–present===
The Choirboys recorded the &quot;Evolver&quot; album in 2002 and 2003 in between going on an extensive tour of Australia and New Zealand. Former Icehouse drummer Paul Wheeler joined the band. The &quot;Evolver&quot; album was released in 2004 but due to low promotion for the album, it peaked at 174 in the Australian charts. The band returned to the Australian singles charts in Australia in July when dance producer Nick Skitz asked Gable to sing &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; on a dance reworking. The song, billed as &quot;Nick Skitz vs. Choirboys&quot;, debuted in the top 20 of the Australian singles charts.

In 2006, The Choirboys performed &quot;Run To Paradise&quot; on the Grand Final edition of &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; and released &quot;Big Bad and Acoustic&quot; with re-recorded versions of their earlier work. In 2007 they resurfaced to bring out their next studio album, &quot;So Easy&quot;, which contained cover versions of The Easybeats songs. Gable said, &quot;We thought it a worthwhile exercise to explore them in a more modern light. We could redo things with a greater technical capacity [...] we could put in backgrounds that two-track recording wouldn&#x27;t allow. With Pretty Girl, for example, we spent quite a bit of time, adding about 80 backing vocals around the lead&quot;.

Gable hosted a radio show, &quot;Vega Sunday Session&quot;, on Vega 95.3 FM Sydney and Melbourne. The show featured local and international artists talking about their lives and their music. On 25 October, The Choirboys performed &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; at the Gold Coast SuperGP (formerly Indy Carnival). They released a second compilation, &quot;Never Gonna Die – The Very Best of Choirboys 30th Anniversary&quot; (2009), and followed with a national tour into 2010.
Gable as of 2012 hosts his own radio show &quot;The Awesome Eighties&quot; on 107.7 2GO (2GGO) FM Central Coast. The show which is aired 5 days a week consists of interviews and insight into the music and the artists of the 1980s.

In 2018, The Choirboys released the instrumental album, &quot;1965, Life&#x27;s a Beach&quot;.
In 2019, the Choirboys released a series of cover EPs, titled &quot;6 Pack of the Hits&quot;.

In 2021, The Choirboys released the singles &quot;Feels Good&quot;, &quot;Sorry&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous&quot; followed by &quot;Feels Good&quot;. &quot;Feels Good&quot; is a compilation of live streams songs, released on vinyl on 29 October 2021.

On 17 December 2021 the band announced through their social media pages that drummer Lindsay Tebbutt had died from mesothelioma.

<doc id="826669" wikidata="Q766383" url="?curid=826669" title="Quantitative structure–activity relationship">
<text>Quantitative structure–activity relationship models (QSAR models) are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences and engineering. Like other regression models, QSAR regression models relate a set of &quot;predictor&quot; variables (X) to the potency of the response variable (Y), while classification QSAR models relate the predictor variables to a categorical value of the response variable.

In QSAR modeling, the predictors consist of physico-chemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors of chemicals; the QSAR response-variable could be a biological activity of the chemicals. QSAR models first summarize a supposed relationship between chemical structures and biological activity in a data-set of chemicals. Second, QSAR models predict the activities of new chemicals.

Related terms include &quot;quantitative structure–property relationships&quot; (&quot;QSPR&quot;) when a chemical property is modeled as the response variable.
&quot;Different properties or behaviors of chemical molecules have been investigated in the field of QSPR. Some examples are quantitative structure–reactivity relationships (QSRRs), quantitative structure–chromatography relationships (QSCRs) and, quantitative structure–toxicity relationships (QSTRs), quantitative structure–electrochemistry relationships (QSERs), and quantitative structure–biodegradability relationships (QSBRs).&quot;

As an example, biological activity can be expressed quantitatively as the concentration of a substance required to give a certain biological response. Additionally, when physicochemical properties or structures are expressed by numbers, one can find a mathematical relationship, or quantitative structure-activity relationship, between the two. The mathematical expression, if carefully validated, can then be used to predict the modeled response of other chemical structures.

A QSAR has the form of a mathematical model:
* Activity = &quot;f&quot;(physiochemical properties and/or structural properties) + error

The error includes model error (bias) and observational variability, that is, the variability in observations even on a correct model.

== Essential steps in QSAR studies ==
The principal steps of QSAR/QSPR include:
# Selection of data set and extraction of structural/empirical descriptors
# Variable selection
# Model construction
# Validation evaluation

== SAR and the SAR paradox ==

The basic assumption for all molecule-based hypotheses is that similar molecules have similar activities. This principle is also called Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR). The underlying problem is therefore how to define a &quot;small&quot; difference on a molecular level, since each kind of activity, e.g. reaction ability, biotransformation ability, solubility, target activity, and so on, might depend on another difference. Examples were given in the bioisosterism reviews by Patanie/LaVoie and Brown.

In general, one is more interested in finding strong trends. Created hypotheses usually rely on a finite number of chemicals, so care must be taken to avoid overfitting: the generation of hypotheses that fit training data very closely but perform poorly when applied to new data.

The &quot;SAR paradox&quot; refers to the fact that it is not the case that all similar molecules have similar activities .

== Types ==

=== Fragment based (group contribution) ===

Analogously, the &quot;partition coefficient&quot;—a measurement of differential solubility and itself a component of QSAR predictions—can be predicted either by atomic methods (known as &quot;XLogP&quot; or &quot;ALogP&quot;) or by chemical fragment methods (known as &quot;CLogP&quot; and other variations). It has been shown that the logP of compound can be determined by the sum of its fragments; fragment-based methods are generally accepted as better predictors than atomic-based methods. Fragmentary values have been determined statistically, based on empirical data for known logP values. This method gives mixed results and is generally not trusted to have accuracy of more than ±0.1 units.

Group or fragment-based QSAR is also known as GQSAR. GQSAR allows flexibility to study various molecular fragments of interest in relation to the variation in biological response. The molecular fragments could be substituents at various substitution sites in congeneric set of molecules or could be on the basis of pre-defined chemical rules in case of non-congeneric sets. GQSAR also considers cross-terms fragment descriptors, which could be helpful in identification of key fragment interactions in determining variation of activity.
Lead discovery using fragnomics is an emerging paradigm. In this context FB-QSAR proves to be a promising strategy for fragment library design and in fragment-to-lead identification endeavours.

An advanced approach on fragment or group-based QSAR based on the concept of pharmacophore-similarity is developed. This method, pharmacophore-similarity-based QSAR (PS-QSAR) uses topological pharmacophoric descriptors to develop QSAR models. This activity prediction may assist the contribution of certain pharmacophore features encoded by respective fragments toward activity improvement and/or detrimental effects.

=== 3D-QSAR ===

The acronym 3D-QSAR or 3-D QSAR refers to the application of force field calculations requiring three-dimensional structures of a given set of small molecules with known activities (training set). The training set needs to be superimposed (aligned) by either experimental data (e.g. based on ligand-protein crystallography) or molecule superimposition software. It uses computed potentials, e.g. the Lennard-Jones potential, rather than experimental constants and is concerned with the overall molecule rather than a single substituent. The first 3-D QSAR was named Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) by Cramer et al. It examined the steric fields (shape of the molecule) and the electrostatic fields which were correlated by means of partial least squares regression (PLS).

The created data space is then usually reduced by a following feature extraction (see also dimensionality reduction). The following learning method can be any of the already mentioned machine learning methods, e.g. support vector machines. An alternative approach uses multiple-instance learning by encoding molecules as sets of data instances, each of which represents a possible molecular conformation. A label or response is assigned to each set corresponding to the activity of the molecule, which is assumed to be determined by at least one instance in the set (i.e. some conformation of the molecule).

On June 18, 2011 the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) patent has dropped any restriction on the use of GRID and partial least-squares (PLS) technologies.

=== Chemical descriptor based ===

In this approach, descriptors quantifying various electronic, geometric, or steric properties of a molecule are computed and used to develop a QSAR. This approach is different from the fragment (or group contribution) approach in that the descriptors are computed for the system as whole rather than from the properties of individual fragments. This approach is different from the 3D-QSAR approach in that the descriptors are computed from scalar quantities (e.g., energies, geometric parameters) rather than from 3D fields.

An example of this approach is the QSARs developed for olefin polymerization by half sandwich compounds.

=== String based ===
It has been shown that activity prediction is even possible based purely on the SMILES string.

=== Graph based ===
Similarly to string-based methods, the molecular graph can directly be used as input for QSAR models, but usually yield inferior performance compared to descriptor-based QSAR models.

== Modeling ==

In the literature it can be often found that chemists have a preference for partial least squares (PLS) methods, since it applies the feature extraction and induction in one step.

=== Data mining approach ===

Computer SAR models typically calculate a relatively large number of features. Because those lack structural interpretation ability, the preprocessing steps face a feature selection problem (i.e., which structural features should be interpreted to determine the structure-activity relationship). Feature selection can be accomplished by visual inspection (qualitative selection by a human); by data mining; or by molecule mining.

A typical data mining based prediction uses e.g. support vector machines, decision trees, artificial neural networks for inducing a predictive learning model.

Molecule mining approaches, a special case of structured data mining approaches, apply a similarity matrix based prediction or an automatic fragmentation scheme into molecular substructures. Furthermore, there exist also approaches using maximum common subgraph searches or graph kernels.

===Matched molecular pair analysis===
Typically QSAR models derived from non linear machine learning is seen as a &quot;black box&quot;, which fails to guide medicinal chemists. Recently there is a relatively new concept of matched molecular pair analysis or prediction driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliffs.

== Evaluation of the quality of QSAR models ==

QSAR modeling produces predictive models derived from application of statistical tools correlating biological activity (including desirable therapeutic effect and undesirable side effects) or physico-chemical properties in QSPR models of chemicals (drugs/toxicants/environmental pollutants) with descriptors representative of molecular structure or properties. QSARs are being applied in many disciplines, for example: risk assessment, toxicity prediction, and regulatory decisions in addition to drug discovery and lead optimization. Obtaining a good quality QSAR model depends on many factors, such as the quality of input data, the choice of descriptors and statistical methods for modeling and for validation. Any QSAR modeling should ultimately lead to statistically robust and predictive models capable of making accurate and reliable predictions of the modeled response of new compounds.

For validation of QSAR models, usually various strategies are adopted:
# internal validation or cross-validation (actually, while extracting data, cross validation is a measure of model robustness, the more a model is robust (higher q2) the less data extraction perturb the original model);
# external validation by splitting the available data set into training set for model development and prediction set for model predictivity check;
# blind external validation by application of model on new external data and
# data randomization or Y-scrambling for verifying the absence of chance correlation between the response and the modeling descriptors.

The success of any QSAR model depends on accuracy of the input data, selection of appropriate descriptors and statistical tools, and most importantly validation of the developed model. Validation is the process by which the reliability and relevance of a procedure are established for a specific purpose; for QSAR models validation must be mainly for robustness, prediction performances and applicability domain (AD) of the models.

Some validation methodologies can be problematic. For example, &quot;leave one-out&quot; cross-validation generally leads to an overestimation of predictive capacity. Even with external validation, it is difficult to determine whether the selection of training and test sets was manipulated to maximize the predictive capacity of the model being published.

Different aspects of validation of QSAR models that need attention include methods of selection of training set compounds, setting training set size and impact of variable selection for training set models for determining the quality of prediction. Development of novel validation parameters for judging quality of QSAR models is also important.

== Application ==

=== Chemical ===

One of the first historical QSAR applications was to predict boiling points.

It is well known for instance that within a particular family of chemical compounds, especially of organic chemistry, that there are strong correlations between structure and observed properties. A simple example is the relationship between the number of carbons in alkanes and their boiling points. There is a clear trend in the increase of boiling point with an increase in the number carbons, and this serves as a means for predicting the boiling points of higher alkanes.

A still very interesting application is the Hammett equation, Taft equation and pKa prediction methods.

=== Biological ===

The biological activity of molecules is usually measured in assays to establish the level of inhibition of particular signal transduction or metabolic pathways. Drug discovery often involves the use of QSAR to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific targets and have low toxicity (non-specific activity). Of special interest is the prediction of partition coefficient log &quot;P&quot;, which is an important measure used in identifying &quot;druglikeness&quot; according to Lipinski&#x27;s Rule of Five.

While many quantitative structure activity relationship analyses involve the interactions of a family of molecules with an enzyme or receptor binding site, QSAR can also be used to study the interactions between the structural domains of proteins. Protein-protein interactions can be quantitatively analyzed for structural variations resulted from site-directed mutagenesis.

It is part of the machine learning method to reduce the risk for a SAR paradox, especially taking into account that only a finite amount of data is available (see also MVUE). In general, all QSAR problems can be divided into coding
and learning.

=== Applications ===

(Q)SAR models have been used for risk management. QSARS are suggested by regulatory authorities; in the European Union, QSARs are suggested by the REACH regulation, where &quot;REACH&quot; abbreviates &quot;Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals&quot;. Regulatory application of QSAR methods includes &quot;in silico&quot; toxicological assessment of genotoxic impurities. Commonly used QSAR assessment software such as DEREK or CASE Ultra (MultiCASE) is used to genotoxicity of impurity according to ICH M7.

The chemical descriptor space whose convex hull is generated by a particular training set of chemicals is called the training set&#x27;s applicability domain. Prediction of properties of novel chemicals that are located outside the applicability domain uses extrapolation, and so is less reliable (on average) than prediction within the applicability domain. The assessment of the reliability of QSAR predictions remains a research topic.

The QSAR equations can be used to predict biological activities of newer molecules before their synthesis.

<text>Yutnori (), also known as yut, nyout and yoot, is a traditional board game played in Korea, especially during Korean New Year. The game is also called cheoksa (; ) or sahui (; ) in Hanjaeo(Sino-Korean vocabulary).

==Origin==
&quot;Yutnori&quot; finds its roots in Korea&#x27;s Three Kingdom Period (57 BCE – 668 CE). While its exact origin remains uncertain, evidence of &quot;yunnori&quot; has been documented in various historical records spanning Korea, China, and Japan. A claim by Korean historian and activist Chae Ho-shin suggests its descent from the Korean Kingdom Gojoseon in 2333 BC, as mentioned in a book by Buddhist monk Ilyeon (Park et al., 2013). Petroglyphs bearing records of yunnori during the Joseon era were discovered in the mountains of the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria. Surprisingly, &quot;yut&quot; carvings were also found in a Buddhist temple and were most likely designated prayer sites.

Historians draw connections between &quot;yunnori&quot; and a Chinese chess game called &quot;chupu&quot;/&quot;jeopo&quot; from the 1400s to 1860s, highlighting similarities in their four-token systems. Notably, Goryeo-era documents illustrated yut boards and their 29 stations. &quot;Yunnori&#x27;s&quot; presence is further noted in the eighth-century collection of songs, &quot;Manyo syu&quot;, describing the kingdom of Silla, where yunnori was alternatively known as &quot;cheoksa&quot; or &quot;sahui&quot;, and depicted in traditional Korean paintings (&quot;minhwa&quot;).

==Cultural and astronomical meanings==
Initially, yunnori originated as a religious ritual embodying yin-yang principles and the 28 asterisms. Aligned with East Asian astronomy, the game&#x27;s structure reflected the heavens, earth, four seasons, and the length of the day. Yunnori sticks, with flat and round sides, symbolize yin and yang, while the game&#x27;s leftward direction mirrors the counterclockwise movement of the Big Dipper stars. This symbolic representation signifies sanctity and a departure from mundane daily life. The incorporation of yut in tombstones reinforces its celestial symbolism, expressing wishes to the heavens.

Yunnori involves five key moves – do, gae, geol, yut, and mo – according to Ilyeon&#x27;s interpretation, representing the five tribes of the Gojoseon era. Geol was possibly the king&#x27;s tribe, while the others symbolized four livestock animals – cows, dogs, pigs, and horses (Park et al., 2013).

==Equipment==
The board () is normally made of stitched cloth. The modern board is a rectangular shape, but historically there was also a round variation. There are four straight courses and two diagonal ones. Each of the straight courses comes with five stations, the diagonal ones have five stations, too, but one is shared. This brings the number of stations to twenty-nine in total. The board is also known to sometimes be drawn onto the floor.

Instead of dice, &quot;yut&quot;-sticks are used. (These are similar to those used in the Egyptian board game Senet.) There are two kinds of yut-stick: &quot;jang-jak yut&quot; (장작 윷) and &quot;bam yut&quot; (밤 윷). &quot;Jang-jak yut&quot; are made of wood. There are four sticks of about 15 cm in length and from 2 cm to 3 cm in diameter. These sticks are split into halves. Chestnut-wood is most commonly used, but birch-wood is also common. These woods are chosen for their weight and the fresh sound they make when playing. Bam yut, on the other hand, are wooden sticks of about 3 cm in length. They have a diameter of about 1 cm, and also are split into halves. The bam yut are played in a small bowl, shaken in the palm, and then released.

There are small tokens (marks) used for the game, called &quot;mal&quot; (말, literally a &quot;horse&quot;). There are four tokens for each team, although there are no common rules what a token can be made of. The only rule is that the mals of the opponent teams must be clearly distinguishable. Apart from black and white plastic tokens generally found today, common mals are coins, buttons, small pebbles, or even chess beads (both from Western chess and Korean chess). When choosing the mal, some Koreans consider its &quot;speed&quot;, because the faster a &quot;horse&quot; runs, the better it is thought to run.

===Yut sticks===

The sticks are cast to determine how far a token can advance. The score is determined by counting the sticks that are over, and those that are up. Each combination has a name. One stick over (flat side up) and three sticks up (round side up) is called &quot;do&quot; (도, pig). Two sticks up and two sticks over is called &quot;gae&quot; (개, dog). One stick up and three sticks over is called &quot;geol&quot; (걸, sheep). All sticks over is called &quot;yut&quot; (윷, cow), whereas all sticks up is called &quot;mo&quot; (모, horse). A &quot;do&quot; is worth one space advancement, a &quot;gae&quot; is worth two space advancement, a &quot;geol&quot; is worth 3 space advancement, &quot;yut&quot; is worth 4 space advancement, and &quot;mo&quot; is worth 5 space advancement. When the sticks come to the result of either &quot;yut&quot; or &quot;mo&quot;, the player has another chance of throwing the sticks up again (optional- some people prefer not to play with this rule). If you get &quot;yut&quot; or &quot;mo&quot; consecutively, you play (throw) again.

==Game rules==
The game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate by discussing the strategy.

The start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.

Each team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast. However, a player achieving a &quot;yut&quot; or &quot;mo&quot; earns an extra cast for the turn; if the player casts a &quot;yut&quot; or &quot;mo&quot; at the second cast, they earn an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided they keep casting &quot;yuts&quot; or &quot;mos&quot;. The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves—for example, a &quot;geol&quot; (advance three steps) cannot be split into a &quot;do&quot; (one step) and a &quot;gae&quot; (two steps).

As long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent&#x27;s team, the opponent&#x27;s mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.  However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.

For example, if one casts two &quot;yuts&quot; and one &quot;do&quot; at their first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see &quot;The Stations&quot; below for the station names):

*Put a mal on the board at the &quot;yut&quot; station (uses the first &quot;yut&quot; score); advance to &quot;mo&quot; (uses the &quot;do&quot; score), then to &quot;sok-yut&quot; (uses the second &quot;yut&quot;).
*Put a mal on the board at the &quot;yut&quot; station (uses first &quot;yut&quot; score); put another mal on the board at the same &quot;yut&quot; station (uses the second &quot;yut&quot; score), causing the two mals to move together from then on; advance them to &quot;mo&quot; (uses the &quot;do&quot;).
*Put a mal on the board at the &quot;yut&quot; station (uses the first &quot;yut&quot;); advance to &quot;duet-geol&quot; (uses the second &quot;yut&quot;), then to &quot;duet-yut&quot; (uses the &quot;do&quot;).

The game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (&quot;cham-meoki&quot;). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going &quot;beyond&quot; this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins.

===Special rules===
The game is sometimes enhanced by labeling one, two, or three of the yut stick on their flat side. The &quot;Seoul&quot; rule can be played if one of the sticks is labelled &quot;Seoul&quot; (서울). If this stick is the only one facing down (&quot;do&quot; so that the letters &quot;Seoul&quot; can be read), a mal can be placed directly into the centre (&quot;bang&quot;), which in this case is called &quot;Seoul&quot;. If all the mals are already on the course, this counts as a &quot;do&quot;. The &quot;Busan&quot; rule is similar. One of the yut sticks is labelled &quot;Busan&quot; (부산). Rather than to the centre, the mal travels directly to the far corner (&quot;mo&quot;). Again, this only applies if this is the only stick facing down, and not all mals are on the course already.

There is also the &quot;back&quot; rule, where one of the sticks is labelled &quot;back&quot; (후퇴). If this is the only stick facing down, one of the mals has to go back one step. Depending on the rules used, if none of the mals are on the course, then this is counted as either a &quot;do&quot; or a skipped turn. Alternatively, if the &quot;do&quot; rule is not being used, the other most common rule is for a mal to be placed onto the arrow next to the start. The mal remains there until another &quot;back&quot; is cast. In this case, however, the mal completes the course at once. Furthermore, if a mal is placed on the do spot, and then gets a &quot;back&quot;, then they will be on the &quot;cham-meoki&quot; spot and then will exit the malpan when a do, gae or geul, yut or mo is thrown. Another &quot;back&quot; will put them on the nal-yut spot.

==Social influence==
Given its rich history and symbolism, Yutnori has evolved into a popular traditional game among Korean families and friends, particularly during Seollal and Jeongwol Daeboreum – the first and fifteenth days of the new Lunar Year. Beyond entertainment, Yunnori serves as a means of predicting the future through pyeon yut and yut jeom. Pyeon yut forecasts agricultural abundance when played in groups, while yut jeom focuses on individual fortune-telling. Traditional beliefs associated with Yunnori extend to agricultural predictions, as documented in the Records of Seasonal Festivities around the Capital (Yeolyangsesigi) playing Yunnori past the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar would not ensure a fruitful year (&quot;Seasonal Customs and Traditional Recreation,&quot; 2020).

The Australian film and theatre group, Yut Art, takes its names from the game as a result of the excitement and crowd participation associated with its activities.

==The stations==

Each station of the gameboard has its own name, although they are obscure to most Koreans. It is thought that the outer stations symbolize heaven, and the inner square, the earth. The whole board can be also interpreted as a reflection of universal symmetry and celestial procession, reflecting elements of Korean shamanism.

The mid-Joseon writer Gim Munpyo described the Yut board as symbolising the circle of the cosmos, with the North Star in the centre, surrounded by 28 constellations.

== Fortune-telling ==
According to the Dongguksesigi (literally meaning a Book on Eastern Country&#x27;s Annual Observances), a book listing 22 Korean annual observances, on New Year&#x27;s Eve or New Year&#x27;s Day, there was a game of fortune-telling good and bad with a hand-thrown out of yut. The possible combinations of yut are do, gae, geol, yut, and mo, but yut and mo hit the same thing. As a result, there are 64 fortune tellings in total, and in each case, matters to be careful about behavior and the answer for the year&#x27;s luck are set.

<text>The Tharsis Montes () are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural &quot;montes&quot;) is the Latin word for mountain; it is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.

The three Tharsis Montes volcanoes are enormous by terrestrial standards, ranging in diameter from (Pavonis Mons) to (Arsia Mons). Ascraeus Mons is the tallest with a summit elevation of over , or base-to-peak. For comparison, the tallest volcano on Earth, Mauna Kea in Hawaii, is about across and stands above the ocean floor.

The Tharsis Montes volcanoes lie near the equator, along the crest of a vast volcanic plateau called the Tharsis region or Tharsis bulge. The Tharsis region is thousands of kilometers across and averages nearly above the mean elevation of the planet. Olympus Mons, the tallest known mountain in the Solar System, is located about northwest of the Tharsis Montes, at the edge of the Tharsis region.

The Tharsis Montes were discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971. They were among the few surface features visible as the spacecraft entered orbit during a global dust storm. Appearing as faint spots through the dusty haze, they were informally christened North Spot, Middle Spot, and South Spot. A fourth spot corresponding to the albedo feature Nix Olympica was also visible and later named Olympus Mons. As the dust cleared, it became obvious that the spots were the tops of enormous shield volcanoes with complex central calderas (collapse craters).

The three Tharsis Montes volcanoes are evenly spaced about apart from peak to peak, in a line oriented from southwest to northeast. This alignment is unlikely to be coincidental. Several smaller volcanic centers northeast of the Tharsis Montes are on an extension of the line. The three volcanoes, most notably Arsia Mons, also all have collapse features and rifts, from which flank eruptions issued, that transect them along the same northeast-southwest trend. The line clearly represents a major structural feature of the planet, but its origin is uncertain.

<text>Gavin Turk (born 1967) is a British artist from Guildford in Surrey, and was considered to be one of the Young British Artists. Turk&#x27;s oeuvre deals with issues of authenticity and identity, engaged with modernist and avant-garde debates surrounding the &#x27;myth&#x27; of the artist and the &#x27;authorship&#x27; of a work of art.

==Early work==

Turk studied at Chelsea School of Art from 1986 to 1989, and at the Royal College of Art from 1989 to 1991.

In 1991, tutors at the Royal College of Art refused to present Gavin Turk with his postgraduate degree, a decision based on his graduation exhibition, which was titled &quot;Cave&quot;, and consisted of a whitewashed studio space, containing a blue heritage plaque of the kind normally found on historic buildings, commemorating his own presence as a sculptor, stating &quot;Gavin Turk worked here, 1989–1991&quot;. This bestowed some instant notoriety on Turk, whose work was collected by numerous collectors including Charles Saatchi, who later exhibited Turk&#x27;s work in the exhibition Sensation, which toured London (Royal Academy of Arts), Berlin (Hamburger Bahnhof) and New York (Brooklyn Museum). Turk attended the private view of the Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy, dressed as a down-and-out. The blue plaque from the &quot;Cave&quot; instillation was later exhibited in a museum style case as &quot;Relic (Cave)&quot;, he also had a version of it made by one of the companies who make blue plaques for English Heritage and this is in the Tate collection.

He has subsequently produced an extensive body of work, which purports to question the value and integrity of a hermetic artistic identity. Turk was considered to be one of the group of artists known as the Young British Artists.

== Practice ==

Turk&#x27;s wide ranging practice often incorporates iconic images of figures taken from popular culture and art historical sources. A series of detailed life-sized waxworks, incorporating the artist&#x27;s own appearance, features the artist assuming various poses as different characters, including Sid Vicious, Jean-Paul Marat, and the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Turk&#x27;s most famous work in this series, &quot;Pop&quot; (1993), is a waxwork of Turk as Sid Vicious. The work appropriates the stance of Andy Warhol&#x27;s screen print of Elvis Presley. In the work, the right hand is pointing a gun, a motif which recurs in other works in the series, such as &quot;Bum&quot; (1998).

Turk has appropriated recognisable elements from artists such as Jacques-Louis David, Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol, René Magritte, Alighiero Boetti, Robert Morris (artist), Jasper Johns and The Death of Marat painting by Jacques-Louis David.

== Elvis Presley and Che Guevara ==
From 2005 Turk began producing a small number of silkscreen works on canvas, depicting himself as Elvis Presley, in a pose taken from the paintings by Andy Warhol of the same subject from the 1960s, such as Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Triple Elvis&quot;. Turk applied diamond dust to some of the Elvis works made from diamanté applied to silkscreened canvas in vibrant pop colours, which sparkles in direct light. Examples of Turk&#x27;s Elvis series are &quot;Diamond Yellow Elvis&quot;, 2005 and &quot;Diamond Pink Elvis&quot;, 2005. A set of what appeared to be classic posters of Che Guevara in a beret, again revealed themselves on further scrutiny to be photos of Turk himself.

== Sculpture and public works ==
A series of three-dimensional trompe-l&#x27;œil works includes objects cast into bronze, painted to give the appearance of the original object. Possibly his most revered works, these include bronze sculptures of plastic rubbish bags, see &quot;Bag&quot; (2000). Other sculptures include &quot;Nomad&quot; (2002), a bronze cast of a sleeping bag, and &quot;Box&quot; (2002), which resembles a cardboard box. Turk is perhaps the leading exponent of the painted bronze, and has cast objects from spent matches to worn paving slabs to discarded vehicle exhaust pipes. 

In December 2009, Turk took part in the &quot;Bricks&quot; exhibition at Area 10 in Peckham in Southeast London. However, the day before the exhibition was to start, organisers noticed that his piece entitled &quot;Revolting Brick&quot; had been stolen and replaced with a fake brick. The fake brick held the words &quot;Thank You Have a Nice Day, Next&quot; and was part of a set of 500 that was given away at the exhibition. &quot;Revolting Brick&quot; was number eight in a series of ten that Turk had created and signed. The artist stated that he &quot;was upset but flattered&quot; at what had happened and that the theft &quot;raises questions about value and worth&quot;.

In May 2011, Turk&#x27;s first large-scale, 12-metre public sculpture was unveiled between the One New Change City mall, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel, and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 2017 Turk placed an unofficial blue plaque commemorating Damien Hirst at Newport Street Gallery in London.

In September 2021, Gavin Turk made a piece called &quot;Piscio D&#x27;Artista&quot; whereby he canned his own urine and sold it for its weight in silver through Kickstarter, as an homage to Piero Manzoni&#x27;s 1961 art piece Artist&#x27;s Shit &quot;Merda D&#x27;Artista&quot;, in which Manzoni canned his own excrement and sold it for its weight in gold.

==Exhibitions==
Turk has exhibited widely internationally. His solo exhibitions include &#x27;L&#x27;Amour Fou&#x27;, David Nolan Gallery, New York City (2013), &#x27;Türk&#x27;, Galerist, Istanbul, Turkey (2012), &#x27;Gavin &amp; Turk&#x27;, Ben Brown Gallery, London (2013), &#x27;Jack Shit!&#x27;, Aeroplastics, Brussels, Belgium (2011), &#x27;Before The World Was Round&#x27;, Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, Austria (2011) and &#x27;En Face&#x27;, Galerie Almine Rech, Paris, France (2010), &#x27;The Mirror Stage&#x27;, Goodman Gallery, Cape Town, South Africa (2009), &#x27;Burnt Out&#x27;, Kunsthaus Baselland, Basel, Switzerland (2008), &#x27;Piss Off&#x27;, Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, Austria (2008) and &#x27;Negotiation of Purpose&#x27;, GEM Museum for Contemporary Art, The Hague, Netherlands (2007). Additionally, Turk has had solo exhibitions at Sean Kelly Gallery, New York (2005), the New Art Centre Sculpture Park and Gallery, Salisbury, England (2003), the New Art Gallery in Walsall, England (2002), and &quot;The Stuff Show&quot; at South London Gallery (1998).

Recent group exhibitions include &#x27;Street&#x27;, New Art gallery Walsall (2012), &#x27;Made in Britain: Contemporary Art from the British Council Collection&#x27;, Sichuan (2012), &#x27;Deja-vu? The Art of Copying from Dürer to You Tube&#x27;, Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, Germany (2012), &#x27;Twenty&#x27;, Aurel Scheibler, Berlin, Germany (2012), &#x27;The Art of Chess&#x27;, Bendigo Gallery; University of Queensland Art Museum, Australia (2012), &#x27;Identity Theft&#x27;, Mimmo scognamiglio Arte Contemporanea, Milan, Italy (2010), &#x27;Pop Life: Art in a Material World&#x27;, Tate Modern, London (2009), &#x27;The Third Dimension, Whitechapel Art Gallery&#x27;, London (2009), &#x27;DLA Piper Series: This is Sculpture&#x27;, Tate Liverpool, Liverpool (2009), Turk has also been involved in &quot;teach-in&quot; events such as &quot;The Che Gavara [&quot;sic&quot;] Story&quot; (2001).

== Politics ==
In August 2014, Turk was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In November 2018, Turk was one of 82 people arrested during a coordinated occupation of five bridges in Central London. The demonstration which was co-ordinated by Extinction Rebellion, was to raise the awareness of climate change. Turk said, &quot;It seems like everyone is in an odd sense of denial about climate change.&quot;

==The House of Fairy Tales==

In 2007 Turk established, with his partner Deborah Curtis, The House of Fairy Tales, a children&#x27;s arts charity based in London, that brings together hundreds of artists, performers, actors, writers and philosophers to deliver theatrical events, guides and exhibitions. The project continues to further community education projects based around, supported by, and advocating art. The House of Fairy Tales tour the country in a mobile gallery horse box which made its festival debut at the 2008 Crunch Festival in Hay-on-Wye. In 2009, they appeared at the Glastonbury Festival. In the summer of 2009, The House of Fairy Tales also staged &quot;The Long Weekend&quot;, a pop-up festival for all ages, hosted by Tate Modern.

==Awards==

In 2001, Turk was awarded the Jack Goldhill Sculpture Prize for his work &quot;Bag&quot; (2000) by the Royal Academy of Arts, London, who in 2007 also awarded him the Charles Wollaston award for his work &quot;Dumb Candle&quot; (2007), a carving of a candle made from the top of an old broom handle.

==Professorship==

Turk was awarded an honorary doctorate in Arts, University of East London in 2010. He held the post of professor of Art and Design 2012–2020 at Bath Spa University.

<text>Northeast Italy ( or just ) is one of the five official statistical regions of Italy used by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), a first level NUTS region and a European Parliament constituency. Northeast encompasses four of the country&#x27;s 20 regions:

*Emilia-Romagna
*Friuli-Venezia Giulia
*Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol
*Veneto

==Historical names==
Triveneto (literally &quot;Triple Veneto&quot;) is a historical region of Italy. The area is made up of the three smaller historical regions of (&quot;Euganean Venetia&quot;), (&quot;Julian March&quot;) and (&quot;Tridentine Venetia&quot;). This territory was named after the Roman region of . The entire area was under Austrian rule in 1863; Italy annexed Venezia Euganea in 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence and a controversial plebiscite (see Venetian nationalism); Julian Venetia and Venezia Tridentina passed under the Italian rule in 1919, following the end of World War I. After World War II, Italy retained the most part of Tre Venezie, but lost Slovenian and Croatian majority areas of the upper Isonzo valley (together with the eastern part of Gorizia, today called Nova Gorica), the city of Fiume, most part of Carso region and most part of Istria to Yugoslavia. The areas of Trieste (&quot;Zone A&quot;) and north-west Istria (&quot;Zone B&quot;) were formed in the Free Territory of Trieste: in 1954, Italy reannexed Zone A, while Zone B was ceded to Yugoslavia. Nowadays the name &quot;Triveneto&quot; includes the three administrative regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol
&quot;Venetia et Histria&quot;, an old region of Italy at the time of Roman Empire, refers to Veneto, Trentino, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, East Lombardy and Istria; it was named after the people of Veneti, who inhabited that region, and who are still largely the main ethnic group of the Italian area (other main ethnic groups include Friulani in the east, mostly in Udine province; Ladins in the Dolomites are between Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol; Germans in South Tyrol; and Slovene minorities on the border with Slovenia and in the city of Trieste); while after 1947 Venetian/Istrian Italians are just a minority in Slovenian and Croatian Istria. Roman &quot;Venetia et Histria&quot; was originally created by Augustus as the tenth &quot;regio&quot; in 7 AD alongside the nine other &quot;regiones&quot;. The region had been one of the last regions of Italy to be incorporated into the Roman Empire. It was later renamed by Diocletian the &quot;VIII provincia Venetia et Histria&quot; in the third century. Its capital was at Aquileia, and it stretched geographically from the Arsia River in the east in what is now Croatia to the Abdua in the current Italian region of Lombardy and from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea. &quot;Venetia&quot;, a region which indicated the old land provinces of the Republic of Venice from river Adda to river Isonzo, and is sometimes still used today to indicate this territory together with Trentino and Trieste.

==Geography==
It borders to the north with Austria and Switzerland, to the east with Slovenia, to the south with Liguria, Tuscany, Marche and the small state of San Marino, to the west with Lombardy and for a very short stretch with Piedmont. Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Veneto are washed by the Adriatic Sea

Northeastern Italy includes most of the Po Valley, crossed by the Po river, the longest river in Italy, and includes highly industrialized regions with a high tourist activity.

==Demography==
In 2022, the population resident in north-eastern Italy amounts to 11,532,690 inhabitants.

===Regions===
===Most populous municipalities===

Below is the list of the population residing in 2022 in municipalities with more than inhabitants.

==Languages==
Italian is the main language. Other languages include Venetian, widely spoken in Veneto and along the coast to Trieste and Istria, as well as in the towns of Pordenone and Gorizia in Friuli, and in most of Trentino, but only recognised by the Veneto region; Friulian, spoken in most of Friuli and nationally recognized, and Ladin, spoken by a few thousand people in the Dolomites. Other languages are German, the primary language of South Tyrol, where Italian is spoken by about two thirds of the inhabitants, and Slovene, recognized by Italy and spoken on the border of Italy and Istria, where the main language today is Croatian but Italian is recognized as a minority language due to the presence of the Istrian Italians.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 407.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 23.1% of Italy&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 34,900 euros or 116% of the EU27 average in the same year.

<doc id="826681" wikidata="Q371471" url="?curid=826681" title="Vágar Airport">
<text>Vágar Airport () is the only airport in the Faroe Islands, and is located east of the village of Sørvágur, on the island of Vágar and 46 km (29 miles) west of the capital Tórshavn. Due to the Faroe Islands&#x27; status as a self-governing territory, the airport is not subject to the rules of the European Union. It is the main operating base for Faroese national airline Atlantic Airways and, for a brief period during 2006, was also the base for the low-cost airline FaroeJet.

==History==

===Early years===
The airport was built by British Army Royal Engineers during World War II on the island of Vágar; the site was known as RAF Vagar/Vaagar (Royal Air Force). The site was chosen mainly because it was hard to see from the surrounding waters and any potential German warship. The first aeroplane landed here in Autumn 1942. &quot;(See British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II).&quot; British engineers had similarly first built Reykjavík Airport in Iceland in 1940, then known as RAF Reykjavik, following the British Occupation of Iceland.

After the war, Vágar airfield was abandoned and left unused until 1963, when it was reopened as a civilian airport at the initiative of two Sørvágur residents, Hugo Fjørðoy and Lars Larsen. The two worked with the Icelandic airline Icelandair, which began the scheduled flights to Bergen, Copenhagen and Glasgow using a Douglas DC-3 aircraft. In 1964 a separate airline, Faroe Airways, operated flights, first using chartered aircraft but in 1965 they bought a DC-3 from the Swedish airline Linjeflyg. The company ceased operating on 28 September 1967. In the 1970s, Icelandair was operating Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft into the airport with weekly nonstop service to Glasgow/Bergen and Reykjavík Airport, continuing into the 1990s. In 1988, Atlantic Airways was flying British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jet service nonstop to Copenhagen. Atlantic Airways later entered a partnership with Icelandair in 1995 and began flying its BAe 146 jet to Reykjavík Airport and to Narsarsuaq Airport in Greenland. Icelandair ceased operating their own flights to Vágar in 2004, albeit retaining their partnership with Atlantic Airways. Until 2004 Maersk Air also operated flights into the airport with Boeing 737-500 jetliners to Copenhagen. By 2005, Atlantic Airways was the only regularly scheduled operator at Vágar Airport.

===Development since the 2000s===
Until 2002 travel from the airport to most locations in the Faroe Islands including the capital Tórshavn required a car ferry, but since the Vágatunnilin, a tolled road tunnel, was opened in 2002, travel has been made much easier by giving direct road access to the neighbouring island of Streymoy, where Tórshavn is located.

The runway was extended from to in 2011, allowing a greater variety of aircraft types to be used, and further-away destinations to be introduced. Construction work started in May 2010, and in December 2011, the extended runway was opened and put into use for the first time. Previously, jet aircraft with short airfield performance such as the British Aerospace BAe 146 (which ceased to be produced 2001) were preferred for use into the airport (although Maersk Air operated flights with Boeing 737-500 aircraft), and then the most distant destination was Copenhagen, . The Airbus A319 of Atlantic Airways is able to utilise the extended runway, and services with this type with Atlantic Airways began in March 2012. A new airport terminal opened in June 2014 with increased passenger capacity.

In March 2016, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) began to fly from Copenhagen to Vágar, the first airline other than Atlantic to do so in many years. SAS has had trouble with fog landings which caused cancellations. But in February 2019 SAS started using the Required Navigation Performance procedure, which allows landings in more fog, but requires special onboard equipment, pilot training and approval from the aviation administration. Atlantic Airways began using the system in 2012 as first airline in Europe. As Atlantic Airways transitioned their fleet from Airbus A319s to A320s, they moved their Iceland flights from to Keflavík International Airport in 2018, due to aircraft size restrictions at Reykjavík Airport.

In August 2023, Atlantic Airways inaugurated seasonal service to Stewart Airport, from New York City. The service was later cancelled. 

In 2024, Icelandair resumed service to Iceland in summer 2024, operating a seasonal service with De Havilland Canada Dash-8 aircraft from Reykjavík-Keflavík International Airport.

==Management==
The airport is currently managed by the Danish Transport Authority, although the ownership of the airport was handed over to the Faroese government in May 2007.

==Airlines and destinations==

The airlines in the table below offer regular passenger scheduled and seasonal flights at Vágar Airport.

There are occasional public charter flights operated by major European airlines, e.g. Wizzair and Austrian Airlines, for example for supporters to football qualification matches. There are also fairly frequent corporate charter flights (seats not available to public) done by e.g. Widerøe. The extended runway and better instrument landing system has made it easier for airlines other than Atlantic Airways to land at Vágar.
===Cargo===
==Ground transport==
There are bus services about 10 times each direction per day between the airport and Tórshavn. They take one hour. The road distance to Tórshavn is . Since 2002, the &quot;Vágatunnilin&quot; tunnel () connects the airport and the Vágar island to the main towns and villages in the Faroe Islands.

==Statistics==
==Accidents and incidents==
*26 September 1970: a Fokker F27 Friendship, with registration TF-FIL, from Flugfélag Íslands on flight from Bergen to Vágar Airport, crashed in bad weather on Mykines. The captain and 7 passengers, all seated on the left side of the plane, were killed. 26 passengers and crew survived, some with serious injuries. Three passengers hiked for an hour to reach Mykines village to alert the authorities. Most of the villagers went up the mountain to aid the survivors before the arrival of the Danish patrol vessel F348 &quot;Hvidbjørnen&quot;. A marble memorial was placed in the church.
*25 January 1975: a Fokker F27 aircraft from Maersk Air registered as OY-APB attempted to land on a wet and icy runway. Without having been informed of the conditions, the pilots veered the aircraft off the runway and collided with terrain.
*6 July 1987: a Partenavia P.68 aircraft registered as G-SPOT, operated by Octavia Air, crashed on approach to Vágar Airport in poor weather conditions and limited visibility. The aircraft struck a rocky face (150 metres; 500&#x27; high) located 15 km (10 miles) southwest from the airport. All three occupants were killed.
*3 August 1996: a Gulfstream III of the Danish Air Force crashed during final approach to Vágar Airport in bad weather and poor visibility. Extreme atmospheric turbulences caused the pilots to lose control; the aircraft suddenly rolled 180 degrees and crashed on the slope of a mountain located 2 km (1¼ miles) short of runway (near Selvík stream, west of Sørvágur ). Nine people, including the Danish Chief of Defence Jørgen Garde and his wife, perished as the aircraft collided with high terrain surrounding the airport.

<text>ADME is the four-letter abbreviation (acronym) for &quot;absorption&quot;, &quot;distribution&quot;, &quot;metabolism&quot;, and &quot;excretion&quot;, and is mainly used in fields such as pharmacokinetics and pharmacology. The four letter stands for descriptors quantifying how a given drug interacts within body over time. The term ADME was first introduced in the 1960s, and has become a standard term widely used in scientific literature, teaching, drug regulations, and clinical practice. 

ADME, describes the disposition of a pharmaceutical compound within an organism. The four criteria all influence the drug levels and kinetics of drug exposure to the tissues and hence influence the performance and pharmacological activity of the compound as a drug. Sometimes, liberation and/or toxicity are also considered, yielding LADME, ADMET, or LADMET.

== Components ==

=== Absorption/administration ===
For a compound to reach a tissue, it usually must be taken into the bloodstream – often via mucous surfaces like the digestive tract (intestinal absorption) – before being taken up by the target cells. Factors such as poor compound solubility, gastric emptying time, intestinal transit time, chemical instability in the stomach, and inability to permeate the intestinal wall can all reduce the extent to which a drug is absorbed after oral administration. Absorption critically determines the compound&#x27;s bioavailability. Drugs that absorb poorly when taken orally must be administered in some less desirable way, like intravenously or by inhalation (e.g. zanamivir). Routes of administration are an important consideration.

=== Distribution ===
The compound needs to be carried to its effector site, most often via the bloodstream. From there, the compound may distribute into muscle and organs, usually to differing extents. After entry into the systemic circulation, either by intravascular injection or by absorption from any of the various extracellular sites, the drug is subjected to numerous distribution processes that tend to lower its plasma concentration.

Distribution is defined as the reversible transfer of a drug between one compartment to another. Some factors affecting drug distribution include regional blood flow rates, molecular size, polarity and binding to serum proteins, forming a complex. Distribution can be a serious problem at some natural barriers like the blood–brain barrier.

=== Metabolism ===
Compounds begin to break down as soon as they enter the body. The majority of small-molecule drug metabolism is carried out in the liver by redox enzymes, termed cytochrome P450 enzymes. As metabolism occurs, the initial (parent) compound is converted to new compounds called metabolites. When metabolites are pharmacologically inert, metabolism deactivates the administered dose of parent drug and this usually reduces the effects on the body. Metabolites may also be pharmacologically active, sometimes more so than the parent drug (see prodrug).

=== Excretion ===
Compounds and their metabolites need to be removed from the body via excretion, usually through the kidneys (urine) or in the feces. Unless excretion is complete, accumulation of foreign substances can adversely affect normal metabolism.

There are three main sites where drug excretion occurs. The kidney is the most important site and it is where products are excreted through urine. Biliary excretion or fecal excretion is the process that initiates in the liver and passes through to the gut until the products are finally excreted along with waste products or feces. The last main method of excretion is through the lungs (e.g. anesthetic gases).

Excretion of drugs by the kidney involves 3 main mechanisms:
* Glomerular filtration of unbound drug.
* Active secretion of (free &amp; protein-bound) drug by transporters (e.g. anions such as urate, penicillin, glucuronide, sulfate conjugates) or cations such as choline, histamine.
* Filtrate 100-fold concentrated in tubules for a favorable concentration gradient so that it may be secreted by passive diffusion and passed out through the urine.

== Toxicity ==
Sometimes, the potential or real toxicity of the compound is taken into account (ADME-Tox or ADMET). Parameters used to characterize toxicity include the median lethal dose (LD50) and therapeutic index.

Computational chemists try to predict the ADME-Tox qualities of compounds through methods like QSPR or QSAR.

The route of administration critically influences ADME.

<doc id="826694" wikidata="Q334026" url="?curid=826694" title="Mariawald Abbey">
<text>Mariawald Abbey () was a monastery of the Trappists (formally known as the Cistercians of the Strict Observance), located above the village of Heimbach, in the district of Düren in the Eifel, in the forests around Kermeter, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. In September 2018, the last remaining monks left Mariawald Abbey and the monastery is currently up for sale.

==History==
===Cistercians===
Following Heinrich Fluitter&#x27;s vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a shrine and chapel were built on the site of it, which became a place of pilgrimage, the &quot;Marienwallfahrt&quot;. For the proper care of the site and the pilgrim&#x27;s land was given in 1480 to the Cistercians of Bottenbroich Abbey, who established a priory here, which they were able to move into on 4 April 1486. The new monastery took its name from the shrine to Mary and from the woods in which it was situated: &quot;Marienwald&quot;, or &quot;Mary&#x27;s wood&quot;

In 1795 the monastery was closed as a result of the French Revolution and the monks were expelled. The image of the Virgin was removed to safety in Heimbach. The priory buildings were abandoned and fell into decay.

===Trappists===
In 1860 the priory was re-settled by Trappist monks from Oelenberg Abbey in Alsace.

From 1875 to 1887 the monks were exiled because of the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;cultural conflict&quot;) policies of the Imperial German government. In 1909, Mariawald was raised from the status of priory to that of an abbey.

The monks had to leave the monastery yet again under the Nazi regime during World War II, from 1941 until April 1945, when the surviving members of the community were able to return. The monastery had to be largely rebuilt because it had been seriously damaged in the war.

After World War II, a brewery was run at the abbey until 1956 when beer production ceased, in part due to the availability of water and brewing ingredients.

==Present day==
Mariawald Abbey is the only extant men&#x27;s Trappist monastery in Germany.

The monks follow the Rule of St. Benedict and the constitution of the Cistercians of the Strict Observance. Visitors can also stay a few days in the abbey&#x27;s guesthouse, but the parts of the monastery used by the monastic community cannot be visited.

The abbey runs a tavern and bookshop. It also produces and sells its liqueur. In 1997 it was one of eight Trappist abbeys that founded the International Trappist Association (ITA) to protect the Trappist name from commercial misuse. By the end of January 2018 became known that somewhere in the year the abbey would be closed and the monks distributed over other abbeys.
The monastery has now been officially closed. However, the tavern and bookshop remain open and liqueur production is still ongoing.

The abbey&#x27;s motto is (&quot;Let your light shine&quot;), from Matthew 5:16.

In late 2018, the association &quot;Trappistenkonvent Mariawald e.V.&quot; was renamed to &quot;Kloster Mariawald e.V.&quot;. New members joined this association, and they elected a new executive board.

As of January 1, 2021, Kloster Mariawald GmbH &amp; Co. KG took over the ownership of the association and continued to operate the restaurant, bookstore, liqueur production, and online shipping. The Diocese of Aachen announced, that an attempt is to be made to settle a religious community in Mariawald again, which could then use the premises as tenants.

==Old Rite==
During the tumultuous 1960s, the abbey embraced the current liturgical fashions. However, in 2008 on the Feast of the Presentation of Our Lady in the Temple (21 November), Mariawald Abbey gained from Pope Benedict XVI permission to return to the Old Rite and their original religious discipline. This makes Mariawald unique among Trappist monasteries around the world, in that they adhere to their traditional, strict rule, including the office of the liturgical books in force in the Catholic Church in 1962 (particularly the traditional Latin Mass according to the old Trappist use).

<text>Ynysybwl ( ) is a village in Cwm Clydach in Wales. It is situated in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, roughly north-north-west of Cardiff, north of Pontypridd and south of Merthyr Tydfil, and forms part of the community of Ynysybwl and Coed-y-Cwm.

Cwm Clydach is flanked by the Rhondda and Cynon Valleys. The market town of Pontypridd lies to the south at the meeting point of the three valleys; and to the north lies the large Llanwynno forestry. Before the local government reforms of 1996 Ynysybwl was in the Cynon Valley district of Morgannwg Ganol, and the area is historically a part of Glamorgan (Morgannwg).

==Etymology==
&quot;Ynys&quot; is a placename element often translated as &quot;island&quot; or &quot;river meadow&quot;, in the south Wales Valleys the word commonly refers to meadows on the banks of rivers, and Ynysybwl likely refers to one such meadow on the Clydach. However the meaning of the second element is much less certain.

The modern spelling of Ynysybwl suggests that the second element may be &quot;bŵl&quot; (meaning a bowl or bowl-shaped) in reference to the shape of the river-meadow or the valley itself. In the nineteenth century, Ynysybwl was noted as a place for fairs and sports, especially ballgames such as Welsh handball. Thomas Morgan stated that he believed that Ynysybwl was a corruption of &quot;Ynys-y-bêl&quot; (the meadow of the ball) in reference to its long history as a meeting place for ballgames. A third derivation is that this element is &quot;pŵll&quot; the Welsh word for a pit. This is also noted by Morgan, who also suggests that the element may be &quot;pwl&quot;, which means unprofitable.

==Early history==
Ynysybwl is located in the centre of the Llanwynno parish, at the point where the stream known as Y Ffrwd flows into the Nant Clydach. Then a collection of small local farms and meadows in a quiet and completely rural valley, at the 1841 census around 200 people lived in the village and surrounding farms.

==Religion==
==Governance==
Ynysybwl was the name of an electoral ward, created in 1898 for elections to Mountain Ash Urban District Council.

Since 1995 Ynysybwl has been an electoral ward to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, electing one county borough councillor. Following a local government boundary review, the number of councillors was increased to two, effective from the 2022 Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council election.

At the lowest tier of local government, Ynysybwl is represented by Ynysybwl &amp; Coed-y-Cwm Community Council.

==Coal Industry==
The rich seams of coal in the Mynachdy level that lie beneath the surface had thus far only been tapped to the amount required to supply these local farms. David Davies began test bores in the early 1880s at Graigddu (&quot;Black Rock&quot;), which proved positive, and the resultant sinking of Lady Windsor Colliery by the Ocean Coal Company on 16 June 1884 gave birth to new coal town.

===Lady Windsor Colliery===

Lady Windsor Colliery opened in 1886, with 300 new miners&#x27; houses built on the opposite (western) side of the valley in typical terraced fashion by the mining company to house its workers and their families.

At its peak, the colliery employed around 1,500 people directly, although most of the 6,000-7,000 village community relied upon the pit in one way or another. The pit thrived throughout the first half of the 20th century, one of a number of very successful mines in South Wales.

However coal mining fell out of favour with many people, including politicians, and the Lady Windsor Colliery did not escape the troubles that plagued the industry during the miners&#x27; strikes of the early 1980s. The pit was finally closed in 1988.

==Present day==

Despite the pit closure, the village has survived, people finding work in the newly developing industries in nearby Pontypridd, Treforest, Aberdare, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff.

This, coupled with the replacement of the pit as the village focus by local churches, Nonconformist chapels, clubs and associations, has led to a renewed interest in regeneration of the village. This led to the formation of the Ynysybwl Regeneration Partnership, an umbrella group formed to help achieve funding and organisation for activities within the village.

Today, Ynysybwl has many clubs and associations for such a small village, boasting karate, rugby, football, bowls, and a pony club. The village no longer has a male voice choir.

The nearby Llanwynno forestry also has the successful Daerwynno Outdoor Activity Centre, an outdoor pursuits centre run by people from the village, and a newly developing cycle path that will form part of the local Taff Trail.

==Places and events==
As with many Industrial Revolution-born villages, Ynysybwl is a community based around a number of key places.

The local Trerobart and Glanffrwd schools cater for over 450 pupils. The Recreation Ground is the home to many of the village&#x27;s sporting clubs, hosting rugby, football, cricket and bowls as well as incorporating a large playing area.

The largest regular event around Ynysybwl is the regular passage of the Network Q Rally of Great Britain through the Llanwynno forestry.

A further traditional event is the running of the Nos Galan Races, in tribute to the legend of Guto Nyth Brân.

Overlooking the village from the mountainside is a prominent rock formation known locally as Rock Ar Valla (.) The origin of this name is unknown however, due to language and mispronunciation, is also known as Rock Of Allah and Rock Ar Allan (.)

==Transport==
The Ynysybwl branch line railway was opened in 1885 to serve mineral workings in the valley. A passenger service was started in 1890, at first to Abercynon but later more conveniently to Pontypridd.

Lady Windsor Colliery was a dominant source of business for the line. After World War II passenger carrying declined greatly, and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1953. The line closed completely in 1988 when Lady Windsor Colliery closed.

<text>The New Naturalist Library (also known as &quot;The New Naturalists&quot;) is a series of books published by Collins in the United Kingdom, on a variety of natural history topics relevant to the British Isles. The aim of the series at the start was: &quot;To interest the general reader in the wild life of Britain by recapturing the inquiring spirit of the old naturalists.&quot; An editors&#x27; preface to a 1952 monograph says: &quot;An object of the &quot;New Naturalist&quot; series is the recognition of the many-sidedness of British natural history, and the encouragement of unusual and original developments of its forgotten or neglected facets.&quot;

The first volume to appear was E.B. Ford&#x27;s &quot;Butterflies&quot; in 1945. The authors of this series are usually eminent experts, often professional scientists. This gives the series authority, and many are or have been authoritative introductory textbooks on a subject for some years. The books are written in scientific style, but are intended to be readable by the non-specialist, and are an early example of popular science in the media.

The books of the series have had considerable influence on many students who later became professional biologists, such as W.D. Hamilton and Mike Majerus. The latter was inspired by Ford&#x27;s &quot;Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Moths&quot;, and has since added two volumes of his own to the series.

A parallel series known as the &quot;New Naturalist Monograph Library&quot; (and often referred to as &quot;The New Naturalist Special Volumes&quot;) was also published. Its aim was to cover &quot;in greater detail... a single species or group of species&quot;. There have been no additions to the &quot;Monograph Library&quot; since 1971.

Volume 82 of the main series, &quot;The New Naturalists&quot;, described the series to date, with authors&#x27; biographies and a guide to collecting the books.

The original editorial board consisted of Julian Huxley, James Fisher, Dudley Stamp, John Gilmour and Eric Hosking. Until 1985, the highly characteristic dust jacket illustrations were by Rosemary and Clifford Ellis; since then they have been by Robert Gillmor.

Being a numbered series, with a very low print run for some volumes, the books are highly collectable. Second-hand copies of the rarer volumes, in good condition, can command high prices. The 100th volume, &quot;Woodlands&quot; by Oliver Rackham was published in 2006. &quot;Woodlands&quot; (volume 100) was also published in 2006 as a &quot;leatherbound&quot; edition, limited to 100 copies. In fact it was fake leather. The second &quot;leatherbound&quot; &quot;New Naturalist&quot; - &quot;Dragonflies&quot; by Philip Corbet and Stephen Brooks - was published in 2008. The (fake) leather edition of &quot;Dragonflies&quot; (volume 106) was initially limited to 400 copies, which was subsequently limited to 303, and finally to 250. According to the New Naturalist website only 217 were actually sold and the remaining unsold stock is being kept secure at HarperCollins&#x27;s offices. HarperCollins continue to produce limited numbers of &quot;leatherbound&quot; editions of all volumes published since &quot;Dragonflies&quot;, but only from &quot;Islands&quot; (volume 109) was real leather actually used. All recent volumes have only 50 leatherbound copies.

The series won the 2007 British Book Design and Production Award for &quot;brand or series identity&quot;, and in 2008 the official website was launched, with features including the latest news, a members only area with access to exclusive content and downloads, and a forum.

In around 1990, Bloomsbury produced a series of facsimile editions, as hardbacks with new dustjacket designs, and with all plates in black and white, including those which were originally in colour.

<doc id="826701" wikidata="Q1035634" url="?curid=826701" title="Mamertine Prison">
<text>The Mamertine Prison (), in antiquity the Tullianum, was a prison (&quot;carcer&quot;) with a dungeon (&quot;oubliette&quot;) located in the Comitium in ancient Rome. It is said to have been built in the 7th century BC and was situated on the northeastern slope of the Capitoline Hill, facing the Curia and the imperial forums of Nerva, Vespasian, and Augustus. Located between it and the Tabularium (record house) were the Gemonian stairs leading to the Arx of the Capitoline.

The church of San Giuseppe dei Falegnami now stands above the Mamertine.

==Name and origin==
The origins of the prison&#x27;s names are uncertain. The traditional derivation of &quot;Tullianum&quot; is from the name of one of the Roman kings Tullus Hostilius or Servius Tullius (the latter is found in Livy, Varro, and also Sallust); there is an alternative theory that it is from the archaic Latin &quot;tullius&quot; &quot;a jet of water&quot;, in reference to the cistern. The name &quot;Mamertine&quot; is medieval in origin, and may be a reference to a nearby temple of Mars.

According to tradition, the prison was constructed around 640–616 BC, by Ancus Marcius. It was originally created as a cistern for a spring in the floor of the second lower level. Prisoners were lowered through an opening into the lower oubliette.

==Use==
Imprisonment was not a sentence under Roman statutory law, though detention is mentioned in the Twelve Tables and throughout the Digest. &quot;Detention&quot;, however, includes debt bondage in the early Republic; the wearing of chains &quot;(vincula publica)&quot;, mainly for slaves; and during the Imperial era a sentence of hard labor at the mills, mines or quarries. Slaves or lower-status citizens sentenced to hard labor were held in prison camps.

Incarceration &quot;(publica custodia)&quot; in facilities such as the Tullianum was intended to be a temporary measure prior to trial or execution; abuses of this principle occurred but were officially censured. Located near the law courts, the Tullianum was used as a jail or holding cell for short periods before executions and as a site for executions. In 63 BC, certain co-conspirators of Catiline, including Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura, were held briefly in the Tullianum and executed there for their alleged plot to overthrow the government. In this case, the executions were conducted hastily, without due process of appeal, during the consulship of Cicero, who was later exiled for his actions. Sejanus was held in the Tullianum before his baroque execution, which involved the Gemonian stairs, and the conflicting accounts of the end of Pleminius include a timely death in jail during trial. Some Gracchan sympathizers ended up in the &quot;Carcer&quot;, where the haruspex Herennius Siculus hit his head on an architrave and died before he could be executed.

There is no evidence that the Tullianum was used for long-term incarceration, and the lowest dungeon was unsuited for the purpose; the level above, however, in theory might have been. In general, long-term incarceration was more widely practiced in the later Empire, and from the 4th century, under Christian rule, Roman laws and occasional personal intervention on the part of an emperor indicate a growing need to crack down on abuses such as filthy conditions and torture.

In some cases, it is unclear whether a source using the word &quot;carcer&quot; means &quot;the&quot; Carcer, or imprisonment in some other facility. High-status prisoners, whether Roman or foreign, were typically held in the custody of individual Romans, sometimes at their homes or country estates. The line between being a war captive and a hostage lawfully held by treaty was thin, and conditions of captivity could vary widely, from abject misery and humiliation to relative luxury. As a prisoner of war, Perseus of Macedon was placed in a foul, overcrowded dungeon at Alba Fucens; the son of Tigranes was kept at a praetor&#x27;s house in Rome, where he could be trotted out as a dinner-party guest. The Tullianum only rarely played a role in these detentions. Captured foreign rulers or generals were paraded in a Roman conqueror&#x27;s triumph, and on a few occasions the &quot;most prominent, famous, or dastardly&quot; were executed afterward at the Tullianum. These were &quot;strikingly few&quot; in number, and included the Samnite Gaius Pontius, the Gaul Vercingetorix, some &quot;Cilician&quot; pirates, and the Galatian Adiatorix. Jugurtha, king of Numidia, may have been executed at the conclusion of Marius&#x27;s triumph, or he may have died in prison several days afterward. Most high-status war captives were neither executed nor held for any substantial length of time in the Tullianum.

==Christian significance==

Although Saint Paul is said to have been held in Mamertine Prison, he awaited trial in a house in the southern Campus Martius that became the church San Paolo alla Regola. It is not known when the prison went out of service permanently, but the site has been used for Christian worship since medieval times, and is currently occupied by two superimposed churches: San Giuseppe dei Falegnami (upper) and San Pietro in Carcere (lower). The Cross on the altar in the lower chapel is upside down, since according to tradition Saint Peter was crucified that way.

It has been long referenced that St. Peter was imprisoned at the Tullianum, and that the spring in the bottom of the pit came into existence miraculously to enable him to conduct baptisms, but the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; points out that the spring had existed long before, and that there is little first hand account of St. Peter&#x27;s imprisonment there other than being the only single celled prison available for VIPs deemed threats to the state. Saint Paul was a Roman citizen tried and executed under Nero.

<text>Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire is the second studio album by the American punk rock band Alkaline Trio, released on March 14, 2000 on Asian Man Records. Produced by Matt Allison, it was the band&#x27;s final studio album with founding drummer Glenn Porter and their last album with Asian Man Records.

After recording the album, Porter was replaced by former Smoking Popes drummer Mike Felumlee, who made his stage debut in December 1999. The band promoted the album with an appearance on the 2000 Plea for Peace Tour in June and July of that year.

== Reception ==

By August 2008, the album sold 85,000 copies.

Mike DaRonco of Allmusic liked the album, but less than the band&#x27;s previous effort, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Goddamnit&quot;, saying that &quot;Lyrically, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; follows in the footsteps of &quot;Goddamnit&quot;, while staying true to the elaborate but emotional tone of aggressive pop-punk. Not as essential as the Trio&#x27;s previous efforts, but it would be difficult for any band to follow up an album like &quot;Goddamnit&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="826709" wikidata="Q568342" url="?curid=826709" title="Tabularium">
<text>The Tabularium was the official records office of ancient Rome and housed the offices of many city officials. Situated within the Roman Forum, it was on the front slope of the Capitoline Hill, below the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, to the southeast of the &quot;Arx&quot;.

Within the building were the remains of the Temple of Veiovis. In front of it were the Temples of Vespasian and Concord, as well as the Rostra and the rest of the forum. Presently the Tabularium is only accessible from within the Capitoline Museums, although it still provides a panoramic view over the forum.

The construction of the Tabularium was ordered around 78 BC by the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. The building was completed by Quintus Lutatius Catulus Capitolinus, consul in 78 BC. This was part of a public works programme for the redevelopment of the Capitoline Hill, which had been damaged by a fire in 83 BC. The construction by Catulus is not mentioned in the ancient literature. It is known through an inscription (CIL 1).

==Architecture==
The building itself had a facade of peperino and travertine blocks. The interior vaults are of concrete.

Its great corridor, long, raised above the forum on a massive substructure, is still partly preserved. This corridor was lighted through a series of arches divided by semi-detached columns of the Doric order, the earliest example of this class of decoration, which is in the Theatre of Marcellus, the Colosseum, and all the great amphitheatres throughout the Roman Empire, constituted the decorative treatment of the wall surface and gave scale to the structure.

The facade faced the back of the Temple of Concord in the forum and consisted of three levels. The first story was a large and tall fortified wall with a single door and only small windows near the top to light the interior, forum level rooms. The second story featured a Doric arcade (partially preserved) and the third, no longer extant story, had a high Corinthian order colonnade. The upper floors of this structure were much changed in the 13th century, when the &quot;Palazzo dei Senatori&quot; was built.

Some scholars, such as Filippo Coarelli, in the past, have suggested that the Tabularium itself is unattested to in any literary sources. Furthermore, its function and purpose has been the subject of debate. The unity of the main structure does however suggest that the building was at least initially conceived to serve a singular purpose. To illustrate the complexity of the building, Filippo Coarelli has stated that a particular annex of the Aerarium Saturni was constructed specifically to house metal ingots and minted Republican coins.
Recent evidence, in the form of six military diplomas dated from 85 to 88 AD, confirms the existence of the Tabularium in its renowned form.
Coarelli has suggested that the Tabularium can be dated precisely to 78 BC, although construction began many years prior and almost certainly prior to the death of Sulla. The building itself is in many ways intrinsically tied to the politics of Sulla, especially in regard to the temple substructure.

The structure was considered such an enduring masterpiece of late Republican architecture, that a funerary inscription for the architect, commissioned by Lutatius Catalus, was created and preserved in a courtyard of the hospital of the Fatebenefatelli, on Tiber island. The inscription reads as follows: &quot;Lucius Cornelius, son of Lucius, of the Voturia tribe, chief engineer to Q. Lucius Catulus when he was consul, architect (to him) when he was censor.&quot;

==Modern scholarship==
Nicholas Purcell&#x27;s article &quot;Atrium Libertatis&quot; is aligned with the view of contemporary historians regarding the epigraphic evidence once present within the Tabularium. In his detailed analysis of the now-lost inscriptions, Purcell makes clear that these inscriptions have compounded our misunderstanding of one of the largest, oldest and best-preserved buildings of the Roman Republic.

The generic terms of a and a Tabularium were recorded by an early Renaissance antiquarian in that order. It is arguable that the identification of the so-called &quot;Tabularium&quot; is incorrect. Purcell draws our attention to the lack of archaeological and epigraphic knowledge on , suggesting that these inscriptions were not intended to be grandiose in scope, nor did they name the building, which further reflects the prevailing credulity of the structure in question. Purcell&#x27;s reference to the archaeological research conducted by Theodor Mommsen aligns with his argument and likely indicates that historians must set aside such misunderstandings reflected in the literary sources. As Mommsen stated quite rightly, that Tabularium may refer to any structure associated with administration. Therefore, it is likely that the Tabularium in question, despite the sheer size fronting the Capitoline Hill, was one of many structures built for the purpose of holding records.

Purcell&#x27;s assessment of the epigraphic evidence once found within the structure in question reaffirms the following view, long held by academics, that the Tabularium is insufficiently documented and the product of scholarly inertia. This, unfortunately, has further compounded our understanding of the Capitoline substructure and, as a result, we are no closer to identifying the extent of its function, let alone its name.

An article by Pier Luigi Tucci (2005) radically changed the way historians and archaeologists alike would view the Tabularium, questioning the very identification of the structure and its function. Exploring the history of archaeology at the site, Tucci makes clear that the identification of the so-called Tabularium is hinged solely upon an inscription long lost (CIL VI 1314, 31597), with no ancient evidence from the period directly correlating to the site. As such, it is arguable that the word &quot;Tabularium&quot; itself has been used incorrectly in modern scholarship with reference to the building. Instead, Tucci argues that the substructure, which provides the foundations for the entire building, was itself likely a Tabularium, being one of many offices housed within Roman buildings and temples for the purpose of holding records. As such, Tucci disputes the idea that a sole Tabularium or mass archive of Rome ever existed. In alignment with this argument, Tucci subsequently seeks to identify the structure in occupation of the space above the Tabularium substructure. In examining the architectural link between the rooms of the substructure and that of a south-western building, Tucci, in accordance with historians before him, could identify the remnants of an extension of the , or treasury, which was housed in the Temple of Saturn. Subsequently, in correlation with the accounts of Livy (7.28.4–6), Ovid (Fasti 6.183–185) and Cicero (De domo 38.101), Tucci draws attention to a clear association between the location of this mint, and that of the Temple of Juno Moneta. With reference to the archaeological research of Giannelli and his identification of concrete remains in the Aracoeli Garden in the forum, Tucci argues for the foundations of Giannelli&#x27;s supposed Temple of Juno Moneta to date back to the 4th century BC, thus indicating a relocation. Tucci&#x27;s argument thus is fulfilled as he concludes that in circa 78 BC, the Temple of Juno Moneta was rededicated atop the substructure of the Tabularium, in a complex which included the extended , and that this relocation likely occurred after the fire of 83 BC. As a result, Tucci called into question both the identification and function of the so-called Tabularium, in his attempt to overturn a theory that had been taken for historical fact since the 15th century AD.

Fillipo Coarelli (2010) uses the arguments and findings of Nicholas Purcell (1993), Henner von Hesberg (1995) and Pier Luigi Tucci (2005) to propose an alternative understanding of the function of the Tabularium. These works are characterised by their ability to provide alternative understandings when questioning the function of the Tabularium. It is important to note that prior these studies, research and scholarship of the Tabularium was primarily saturated by the Richard Delbrück&#x27;s , published in 1875. It was Delbrück&#x27;s findings that rendered the conclusion that the Tabularium served as a house of public records. However, writing in 2010, Coarelli has had access to a wider range of both archaeological and written sources that probe a deeper inquest in to traditional discourses that cloud our conception of the function and meaning of the Tabularium.

Within , Coarelli fundamentally purports that &quot;the so-called Tabularium is not the archive of the Roman State, known by this name, and the rejection of this long held but incorrect hypothesis permits us to study the monument afresh&quot;. He goes on to state that &quot;[the Tabularium] represents in fact the foundations (substructio) of a large temple of the Sullan period, restored by Domitian after the fire of 80 AD&quot;. Throughout his work, Coarelli uses the findings of Purcell, von Hesberg and Tucci as a roadmap that forms the basis of his argument. He begins with Purcell&#x27;s epigraphic discoveries that connotes the classification of the Tabularium as a records building: ( of the [Roman] people where the public [documents] are housed). Moving to von Hesberg, Coarelli highlights the study of the dimensions of architectural pieces from the Tabularium that suggest &quot;the second floor of the building must have been significantly wider than the arched lower floor&quot;, proposing that there was a temple structure within the Tabularium. Finally, Coarelli&#x27;s inclusion of Tucci&#x27;s findings builds upon von Hesberg&#x27;s assertion, serving as a sounding board for Coarelli&#x27;s initial thesis, that the Tabularium served as the basement of a proposed temple.

Coarelli tracks the structural changes that took place within the Tabularium, and ultimately concludes that it is challenging for historians to ascertain the absolute meaning of this structure due to the &quot;complexity of [it]&quot;. He points out that only until recently have we been able to understand that the Tabularium actually existed due to the emergence of from six military diplomas, with dates ranging from  85–88 AD. Further, these diplomas refer the location of the Tabularium publicum to the . Here, the location is extremely significant. Coarelli states that the Tabularium &quot;must have been situated in the immediate environs of the area Capitolina, where the military diplomas were displayed until 90 AD&quot;. Thus, it is clear that the Tabularium was a multifaceted building that pertained to the political and religious culture of the Roman Empire. 
Thus, by expanding upon the arguments of Purcell, von Hesberg and Tucci, Coarelli positions himself to further execute his overarching thesis with increased clarity. Fundamentally, by galvanising the &quot;deep-rooted biases&quot; that obfuscate the understanding of the Tabularium, Coarelli is able to suggest that the Tabularium is rather a multifaceted structure that pertained to the political and religious centre of the Roman world.

<doc id="826712" wikidata="Q5044101" url="?curid=826712" title="Carnival Road March">
<text>The Carnival Road March is the musical composition played most often at the &quot;judging points&quot; along the parade route during a Caribbean Carnival. Originating as part of the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, the term has been applied to other Caribbean carnivals. There it was and is still viewed as a musical genre.

In Trinidad and Tobago the Road March title has been officially given out every year since 1932 (with the exception of the years affected by World War II when Carnival did not officially take place). Popular Unofficial Road Marches have also been recognized in T&amp;T from since 1834 after slavery was abolished. Prior to World War II, T&amp;T Road Marches were referred to as &quot;Leggos&quot; or &quot;Breakaways&quot; by the general population but were rebranded by the Carnival authorities as the Road March from 1946. Scoring is based upon a register-and-count system devised by a Carnival committee before the start of the parade. 

After a German pop song &quot;Happy Wanderer&quot; by the Obernkirchen Children&#x27;s Choir won the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Road March title in 1955 the rules were amended to restrict songs eligible to be in the road march competition to only songs vocalised by local Trinidad &amp; Tobago artistes. The Road March title is among the most prestigious in Trinidad Carnival. The most such titles have gone to the late Lord Kitchener with eleven wins, ahead of Super Blue with ten wins, Machel Montano also with ten wins and the Mighty Sparrow with eight wins. In the mid-1970s, a woman officially broke through in the male dominated Calypso arena. Calypso Rose was the first female to officially win the Trinidad and Tobago Road March competition in 1977 with her song &quot;Give More Tempo&quot;. The following year 1978 with &quot;Come Leh We Jam&quot; in addition to winning the Road March title again, Calypso Rose also won the &quot;Calypso King&quot; competition, the first time a woman had received that award. As a result, the &quot;Calypso King&quot; competition was officially renamed the &quot;Calypso Monarch&quot; competition to take into account that females also take part and have won titles.

First Calypso recordings were made in 1912 so Trinidad &amp; Tobago Road Marches prior to 1912 were not recorded that year but may have been recorded years later after recording technology became available to Calypso pioneers of the 1910s to 1930s. In 2019 Skinny Fabulous of St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines created history by becoming the second foreign artiste (after the German Obernkirchen Children&#x27;s Choir) and the very first foreign soca artiste to win the prestigious Trinidad &amp; Tobago Road March title with a song called &quot;Famalay&quot; which was vocalised by Skinny Fabulous, Machel Montano and Bunji Garllin.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
Below are over 100 T&amp;T Road Marches starting from this year going back to the 1800s when most calypsos were sung in Patios.
==Antigua and Barbuda==
==Barbados==
==Grenada==
Grenada Carnival, also known as Spicemas, was founded to celebrate the anniversary of the independence of Grenada, Carriacou, and Petit Martinique, which gained their independence on 7 February 1974. In 1978 Grenada Carnival was moved to the month of May by the Eric Gairy led government but after that government was overthrown in March 1979, the 1979 Carnival celebration was cancelled. In 1980 the new People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government (PRG) led by Maurice Bishop brought back Grenada Carnival, which was held in May that year. After a feasibility study Grenada Carnival was moved to August the following year. Hence annually from 1981 Grenada&#x27;s Carnival has been held in August culminating with their Road March competition.
==St. Lucia==
Invader has won the Road March in St. Lucia seven times. In a period from 1970 to 1972 and again from 1974 to 1976, Road March winners were imported from Trinidad and Tobago.

==St. Vincent ==
==Saint Kitts and Nevis==
==St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands==
The Jam Band, formerly Eddie and the Movements has won the Road March Title a record 21 times.

<doc id="826713" wikidata="Q916723" url="?curid=826713" title="Lipinski's rule of five">
<text>Lipinski&#x27;s rule of five, also known as Pfizer&#x27;s rule of five or simply the rule of five (RO5), is a rule of thumb to evaluate druglikeness or determine if a chemical compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has chemical properties and physical properties that would likely make it an orally active drug in humans. The rule was formulated by Christopher A. Lipinski in 1997, based on the observation that most orally administered drugs are relatively small and moderately lipophilic molecules.

The rule describes molecular properties important for a drug&#x27;s pharmacokinetics in the human body, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (&quot;ADME&quot;). However, the rule does not predict if a compound is pharmacologically active.

The rule is important to keep in mind during drug discovery when a pharmacologically active lead structure is optimized step-wise to increase the activity and selectivity of the compound as well as to ensure drug-like physicochemical properties are maintained as described by Lipinski&#x27;s rule. Candidate drugs that conform to the RO5 tend to have lower attrition rates during clinical trials and hence have an increased chance of reaching the market.
Some authors have criticized the rule of five for the implicit assumption that passive diffusion is the only important mechanism for the entry of drugs into cells, ignoring the role of transporters. For example, O&#x27;Hagan and co-authors wrote as follows:This famous &quot;rule of 5&quot; has been highly influential in this regard, but only about 50 % of orally administered new chemical entities actually obey it.

Studies have also demonstrated that some natural products break the chemical rules used in Lipinski filters such as macrolides and peptides.

== Components of the rule ==

Lipinski&#x27;s rule states that, in general, an orally active drug has no more than one violation of the following criteria:
* No more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (the total number of nitrogen–hydrogen and oxygen–hydrogen bonds)
* No more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (all nitrogen or oxygen atoms)
* A molecular mass less than 500 daltons
* A calculated octanol-water partition coefficient (Clog &quot;P&quot;) that does not exceed 5

Note that all numbers are multiples of five, which is the origin of the rule&#x27;s name.
As with many other rules of thumb, such as Baldwin&#x27;s rules for ring closure, there are many &quot;exceptions&quot;.

== Variants ==

In an attempt to improve the predictions of druglikeness, the rules have spawned many extensions, for example the Ghose filter:
* Partition coefficient log &quot;P&quot; in −0.4 to +5.6 range
* Molar refractivity from 40 to 130
* Molecular weight from 180 to 480
* Number of atoms from 20 to 70 (includes H-bond donors [e.g. OHs and NHs] and H-bond acceptors [e.g. Ns and Os])

Veber&#x27;s Rule further questions a 500 molecular weight cutoff. The polar surface area and the number of rotatable bonds has been found to better discriminate between compounds that are orally active and those that are not for a large data set of compounds. In particular, compounds which meet only the two criteria of:
* 10 or fewer rotatable bonds and
* Polar surface area no greater than 140 Å2
are predicted to have good oral bioavailability.

== Lead-like ==

During drug discovery, lipophilicity and molecular weight are often increased in order to improve the affinity and selectivity of the drug candidate. Hence it is often difficult to maintain drug-likeness (i.e., RO5 compliance) during hit and lead optimization. Hence it has been proposed that members of screening libraries from which hits are discovered should be biased toward lower molecular weight and lipophilicity so that medicinal chemists will have an easier time in delivering optimized drug development candidates that are also drug-like. Hence the rule of five has been extended to the rule of three (RO3) for defining lead-like compounds.

A rule of three compliant compound is defined as one that has:
* octanol-water partition coefficient log &quot;P&quot; not greater than 3
* molecular mass less than 300 daltons
* not more than 3 hydrogen bond donors
* not more than 3 hydrogen bond acceptors
* not more than 3 rotatable bonds

<text>Oxalis enneaphylla, or scurvy grass, is a late spring- and summer-flowering, rhizomatous, alpine perennial herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. It is a small plant that grows to high and across, with slightly fleshy, hairy, blue-grey leaves, which are edible but have a sharp taste due to their high oxalic acid content. The name &quot;enneaphylla&quot; comes from the Greek εννεα (&quot;ennea&quot;), &quot;nine&quot; and φυλλον (&quot;phyllon&quot;), &quot;leaf&quot;.

The almond-scented, five-petalled flowers are pink shading to white. They are hermaphrodite and pollinated by Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies).

The plant gets its common name &quot;scurvy grass&quot; from the fact that its leaves are rich in vitamin C. It is not closely related to the other plant known as scurvy-grass (&quot;Cochlearia&quot;), nor is either plant a grass (Poaceae).

Sailors travelling around Cape Horn would consume the leaves to avoid scurvy. This is illustrated by this extract from the Journal of Syms Covington, who sailed aboard with Charles Darwin. Here he describes the Falkland Islands, and refers to &quot;Oxalis enneaphylla&quot; as &quot;wild thyme&quot;:
While laying here we found it very squally, and at times very cold. The island is in general mountainous. Not a single tree to be seen but there are low brushes with red berries which are very good eating. Here are bullocks horses and pigs that run wild, rabbits, wild geese and ducks and most excellent snipe shooting on the marshy ground and long grass, of which the island in general has very little else. Likewise there is the tea plant, which bears very sweet berry, and wild thyme which we used as tea, and is very good and much more plentiful than the former.
This plant is cultivated in temperate regions, and is suitable for rockeries or alpine gardens. The species and the hybrid cultivar &#x27;Ione Hecker&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="826723" wikidata="Q718647" url="?curid=826723" title="Angular diameter">
<text>The angular diameter, angular size, apparent diameter, or apparent size is an angular separation (in units of angle) describing how large a sphere or circle appears from a given point of view. In the vision sciences, it is called the &quot;visual angle&quot;, and in optics, it is the &quot;angular aperture&quot; (of a lens). The angular diameter can alternatively be thought of as the angular displacement through which an eye or camera must rotate to look from one side of an apparent circle to the opposite side.

A person can resolve with their naked eyes diameters down to about 1 arcminute (approximately 0.017° or 0.0003 radians). This corresponds to 0.3 m at a 1 km distance, or to perceiving Venus as a disk under optimal conditions.

==Formulation==
The angular diameter of a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the center of said circle can be calculated using the formula
:formula_1
in which formula_2 is the angular diameter (in units of angle, normally radians, sometimes in degrees, depending on the arctangent implementation), formula_3 is the linear diameter of the object (in units of length), and formula_4 is the distance to the object (also in units of length). When formula_5, we have:
:formula_6,
and the result obtained is necessarily in radians.

===For a sphere===
For a spherical object whose linear diameter equals formula_3 and where formula_4 is the distance to the of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the following modified formula
:formula_9

Such a different formulation is because the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the center of the sphere, and have a distance between them which is smaller than the actual diameter. The above formula can be found by understanding that in the case of a spherical object, a right triangle can be constructed such that its three vertices are the observer, the center of the sphere, and one of the sphere&#x27;s tangent points, with formula_4 as the hypotenuse and formula_11 as the sine.

The formula is related to the zenith angle to the horizon, 
:formula_12
where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the sphere and &quot;h&quot; is the distance to the near of the sphere.

The difference with the case of a perpendicular circle is significant only for spherical objects of large angular diameter, since the following small-angle approximations hold for small values of formula_13:
:formula_14

==Estimating angular diameter using the hand==
Estimates of angular diameter may be obtained by holding the hand at right angles to a fully extended arm, as shown in the figure.

==Use in astronomy==
In astronomy, the sizes of celestial objects are often given in terms of their angular diameter as seen from Earth, rather than their actual sizes. Since these angular diameters are typically small, it is common to present them in arcseconds (). An arcsecond is 1/3600th of one degree (1°) and a radian is 180/&quot;π&quot; degrees. So one radian equals 3,600 × 180/formula_15 arcseconds, which is about 206,265 arcseconds (1 rad ≈ 206,264.806247&quot;). Therefore, the angular diameter of an object with physical diameter &quot;d&quot; at a distance &quot;D&quot;, expressed in arcseconds, is given by:
:formula_16.

These objects have an angular diameter of 1:
*an object of diameter 1 cm at a distance of 2.06 km
*an object of diameter 725.27 km at a distance of 1 astronomical unit (AU)
*an object of diameter 45 866 916 km at 1 light-year
*an object of diameter 1 AU (149 597 871 km) at a distance of 1 parsec (pc)

Thus, the angular diameter of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun as viewed from a distance of 1 pc is 2, as 1 AU is the mean radius of Earth&#x27;s orbit.

The angular diameter of the Sun, from a distance of one light-year, is 0.03, and that of Earth 0.0003. The angular diameter 0.03 of the Sun given above is approximately the same as that of a human body at a distance of the diameter of Earth.

This table shows the angular sizes of noteworthy celestial bodies as seen from Earth:



The angular diameter of the Sun, as seen from Earth, is about 250,000 times that of Sirius. (Sirius has twice the diameter and its distance is 500,000 times as much; the Sun is 1010 times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 105, so Sirius is roughly 6 times as bright per unit solid angle.)

The angular diameter of the Sun is also about 250,000 times that of Alpha Centauri A (it has about the same diameter and the distance is 250,000 times as much; the Sun is 4×1010 times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 200,000, so Alpha Centauri A is a little brighter per unit solid angle).

The angular diameter of the Sun is about the same as that of the Moon. (The Sun&#x27;s diameter is 400 times as large and its distance also; the Sun is 200,000 to 500,000 times as bright as the full Moon (figures vary), corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 450 to 700, so a celestial body with a diameter of 2.5–4 and the same brightness per unit solid angle would have the same brightness as the full Moon.)

Even though Pluto is physically larger than Ceres, when viewed from Earth (e.g., through the Hubble Space Telescope) Ceres has a much larger apparent size.

Angular sizes measured in degrees are useful for larger patches of sky. (For example, the three stars of the Belt cover about 4.5° of angular size.) However, much finer units are needed to measure the angular sizes of galaxies, nebulae, or other objects of the night sky.

Degrees, therefore, are subdivided as follows:
* 360 degrees (°) in a full circle
* 60 arc-minutes () in one degree
* 60 arc-seconds () in one arc-minute

To put this in perspective, the full Moon as viewed from Earth is about °, or 30 (or 1800). The Moon&#x27;s motion across the sky can be measured in angular size: approximately 15° every hour, or 15 per second. A one-mile-long line painted on the face of the Moon would appear from Earth to be about 1 in length.

In astronomy, it is typically difficult to directly measure the distance to an object, yet the object may have a known physical size (perhaps it is similar to a closer object with known distance) and a measurable angular diameter. In that case, the angular diameter formula can be inverted to yield the angular diameter distance to distant objects as 
:formula_17

In non-Euclidean space, such as our expanding universe, the angular diameter distance is only one of several definitions of distance, so that there can be different &quot;distances&quot; to the same object. See Distance measures (cosmology).

===Non-circular objects===
Many deep-sky objects such as galaxies and nebulae appear non-circular and are thus typically given two measures of diameter: major axis and minor axis. For example, the Small Magellanic Cloud has a visual apparent diameter of × .

===Defect of illumination===
Defect of illumination is the maximum angular width of the unilluminated part of a celestial body seen by a given observer. For example, if an object is 40 of arc across and is 75% illuminated, the defect of illumination is 10.

<text>Windows Forms, also known as Winforms, is a free, open-source graphical user interface (GUI) class library for building Windows desktop applications, included as a part of Microsoft .NET, .NET Framework or Mono, providing a platform to write client applications for desktop, laptop, and tablet PCs. While it is seen as a replacement for the earlier and more complex C++ based Microsoft Foundation Class Library, it does not offer a comparable paradigm and only acts as a platform for the user interface tier in a multi-tier solution.

At the Microsoft Connect event on December 4, 2018, Microsoft announced releasing Windows Forms as an open source project on GitHub. It is released under the MIT License. With this release, Windows Forms has become available for projects targeting the .NET Core framework. However, the framework is still available only on the Windows platform, and Mono&#x27;s incomplete implementation of Windows Forms remains the only cross-platform implementation.

== Architecture ==

A &quot;Windows Forms application&quot; is an event-driven application supported by Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework. Unlike a batch program, it spends most of its time simply waiting for the user to do something, such as fill in a text box or click a button. The code for the application can be written in a .NET programming language such as C# or Visual Basic.

Windows Forms provides access to native Windows User Interface Common Controls by wrapping the existent Windows API in managed code. With the help of Windows Forms, the .NET Framework provides a more comprehensive abstraction above the Win32 API than Visual Basic or MFC did.

Windows Forms is similar to Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library in developing client applications. It provides a wrapper consisting of a set of C++ classes for development of Windows applications. However, it does not provide a default application framework like the MFC. Every control in a Windows Forms application is a concrete instance of a class.

== Features ==
All visual elements in the Windows Forms class library derive from the Control class. This provides the minimal functionality of a user interface element such as location, size, color, font, text, as well as common events like click and drag/drop. The Control class also has docking support to let a control rearrange its position under its parent. The Microsoft Active Accessibility support in the Control class also helps impaired users to use Windows Forms better.

In Visual Studio, forms are created using drag-and-drop techniques. A tool is used to place controls (e.g., text boxes, buttons, etc.) on the form (window). Controls have attributes and event handlers associated with them. Default values are provided when the control is created, but may be changed by the programmer. Many attribute values can be modified during run time based on user actions or changes in the environment, providing a dynamic application. For example, code can be inserted into the form resize event handler to reposition a control so that it remains centered on the form, expands to fill up the form, etc. By inserting code into the event handler for a keypress in a text box, the program can automatically translate the case of the text being entered, or even prevent certain characters from being inserted.

Besides providing access to native Windows controls like button, textbox, checkbox and listview, Windows Forms added its own controls for ActiveX hosting, layout arrangement, validation and rich data binding. Those controls are rendered using GDI+.

== History and future ==
Just like Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), the equivalent Java API, Windows Forms was an early and easy way to provide graphical user interface components to the .NET Framework. Windows Forms is built on the existing Windows API and some controls merely wrap underlying Windows components. Some of the methods allow direct access to Win32 callbacks, which are not available in non-Windows platforms.

In .NET Framework 2.0, Windows Forms gained richer layout controls, Office 2003 style toolstrip controls, multithreading component, richer design-time and data binding support as well as ClickOnce for web-based deployment.

With the release of .NET Framework 3.0, Microsoft released a second, parallel API for rendering GUIs: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) based on DirectX, together with a GUI declarative language called XAML. 

During a question-and-answer session at the Build 2014 Conference, Microsoft explained that Windows Forms was under maintenance mode, with no new features being added, but bugs found would still be fixed. Most recently, improved high-DPI support for various Windows Forms controls was introduced in updates to .NET Framework version 4.5.

==XAML backwards compatibility with Windows Forms==
For future development, Microsoft has succeeded Windows Forms with a XAML-based GUI entry using frameworks such as WPF and UWP. However, drag and drop placement of GUI components in a manner similar to Windows Forms is still provided in XAML by replacing the root XAML element of the Page/Window with a &quot;Canvas&quot; UI-Control. When making this change, the user can build a window in a similar fashion as in Windows Forms by directly dragging and dropping components using the Visual Studio GUI.

While XAML provides drag and drop placement backwards compatibility through the Canvas Control, XAML Controls are only similar to Windows Forms Controls and are not one-to-one backwards compatible. They perform similar functions and have a similar appearance, but the properties and methods are different enough to require remapping from one API to another.

== Alternative implementation ==
Mono is a project led by Xamarin (formerly by Ximian, then Novell) to create an Ecma standard compliant .NET Framework compatible set of tools.

In 2011, Mono&#x27;s support for System.Windows.Forms as of .NET 2.0 was announced as complete;
System.Windows.Forms 2.0 works natively on Mac OS X.
However, System.Windows.Forms has not been actively developed on Mono.
Full compatibility with .NET was not possible, because Microsoft&#x27;s System.Windows Forms is mainly a wrapper around the Windows API, and some of the methods allow direct access to Win32 callbacks, which are not available in platforms other than Windows.
A more significant problem is that, since version 5.2,
Mono has been upgraded so that its default is to assume a 64 bit platform.
However, System.Windows.Forms on Mono for the Macintosh OS X platform has been built using a 32 bit subsystem, Carbon.
As of this date, a 64-bit version of System.Windows.Forms for use on Mac OS X remains unavailable and only .NET applications built for the 32 bit platform can be expected to execute.

<doc id="826730" wikidata="Q162611" url="?curid=826730" title="Cochlearia">
<text>Cochlearia (scurvy-grass or spoonwort) is a genus of about 30 species of annual and perennial herbs in the family Brassicaceae. They are widely distributed in temperate and arctic areas of the northern hemisphere, most commonly found in coastal regions, on cliff-tops and salt marshes where their high tolerance of salt enables them to avoid competition from larger, but less salt-tolerant plants; they also occur in alpine habitats in mountains and tundra.

They form low, rounded or creeping plants, typically 5–20 cm tall. The leaves are smoothly rounded, roughly spoon-shaped (the scientific name &quot;Cochlearia&quot; derives from the Latinized form, &quot;cocleare&quot;, of the Greek κοχλιάριον, &quot;kokhliárion&quot;, a spoon; this a diminutive of κόχλος, &quot;kókhlos&quot;, seashell), or in some species, lobed; typically 1–5 cm long, and with a fleshy texture. The flowers are white with four petals and are borne in short racemes.

==Selected species==
About 30 species are usually accepted; several others usually treated as subspecies of &quot;C. officinalis&quot; are accepted as distinct species by some botanists.

*&quot;Cochlearia lichuanensis&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia longistyla&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia megalosperma&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia microcarpa&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia oblongifolia&quot; – East Asian scurvy-grass
*&quot;Cochlearia officinalis&quot; – Common scurvy-grass (including &quot;C. excelsa&quot;, &quot;C. pyrenaica&quot;, &quot;C. scotica&quot;)
*&quot;Cochlearia paradoxa&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia rivulorum&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia rupicola&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia sessilifolia&quot; – Sessile-leaved or Alaskan scurvy-grass
*&quot;Cochlearia sinuata&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia tatrae&quot;
*&quot;Cochlearia tridactylites&quot; – Three-fingered scurvy-grass
*&quot;Cochlearia warburgii&quot;

Two species formerly included in the genus &quot;Cochlearia&quot; are now usually treated in separate genera:
* Horseradish &quot;Armoracia rusticana&quot; (previously &quot;Cochlearia armoracia&quot;)
* Wasabi &quot;Wasabia japonica&quot; (previously &quot;Cochlearia wasabi&quot;)

Cook&#x27;s scurvy grass, &quot;Lepidium oleraceum&quot;, was used by James Cook to prevent scurvy, but is now almost extinct.

==History and uses==
Scurvy-grass is edible raw and cooked, with a flavour similar to cress. The leaves are rich in vitamin C, which cures scurvy, a deficiency disease resulting from a lack of fresh vegetables in the diet.
The plant was frequently eaten in the past by sailors suffering from scurvy after returning from long voyages.
The first-century writer Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79) writes in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (&quot;Natural History&quot;) about a disease suffered by Roman soldiers in Germany. Their symptoms resemble those of scurvy, and Pliny recommends a &quot;Herba britannica&quot;, which has been suggested to be scurvy-grass.

The Rev. George Moore recorded the purchase of &quot;a pint of scurvey-grasse&quot; for 1 &quot;s&quot; in 1662. He apparently &quot;suffered much&quot; from scurvy, purchasing scurvey-grasse in both bundled and bottled form.
The book &quot;Cochlearia curiosa: or the curiosities of scurvygrass&quot; was published in English in 1676,
Described as &quot;both a learned and accurate work&quot;, it was well received,
and apparently brought scurvy-grass &quot;into great repute&quot; as a remedy.
According to the Royal Society, the book contains &quot;not only a description of the several kinds of this plant, with its several names, place, and time of growth, temperature and general vertues, but also an enumeration of the uses, medicinal vertues and manner of applying each part of this plant.&quot;
In 1857, &quot;Cochlearia officinalis&quot; was described in &quot;The Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics&quot; as &quot;A gentle stimulant, aperient, and diuretic. It has long been esteemed as an antiscorbutic. It has also been used in visceral obstructions. It is occasionally eaten with bread and butter, like the water-cress.&quot;

The leaves, which have a strong acrid, bitter, or peppery taste similar to the related horseradish and watercress, are also sometimes used in salads or eaten with bread and butter.

Scurvy-grass sorrel (&quot;Oxalis enneaphylla&quot;) is an unrelated plant from southern South America and the Falkland Islands that was also used to treat scurvy.

==Scurvy-grass and roads==
The advent of modern fast roads treated with salt in winter for ice clearance has resulted in the colonisation by scurvy-grass of many inland areas where it formerly did not occur. The scurvy-grass seeds become trapped on car wheels, transported often for a considerable distance, and then washed off, to grow in the salt-rich soil at the side of the road where other plants cannot survive.

<text>The Gibraltar Parliament is the legislature of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Between 1969 and 2006, it was called the Gibraltar House of Assembly.

==Functions==
The House of Assembly, set up under the 1969 constitution, was a unicameral body originally consisting of 15 members elected by the Gibraltar electorate, plus two appointed members including the Attorney-General. The term &quot;House of Assembly&quot; has been commonly used for the legislatures of British territories that are less than fully sovereign. It was replaced by the current Gibraltar Parliament by the new 2006 constitution, reflecting an increase in its sovereignty. All 17 of the new Parliament&#x27;s members are elected.

Under the election system, each voter was allowed to vote for ten members of the Assembly. Due to the small area of Gibraltar and its territorial continuity, precincts served only as polling places, not political units, and there are no electoral districts served by the members, who were instead elected &quot;at large&quot; to serve the territory as a whole.

The system lends itself to block votingeach of the parties or electoral coalitions tended to nominate a slate of ten candidates and encourage its supporters to vote for all of them. In most cases, the winning party or coalition would have all ten of its nominees elected, with the other seven elected members coming from the second-place party.

==Parliament building==

The Parliament sits in a building overlooking Main Street and John Mackintosh Square. It was constructed in 1817 and previously served as the Exchange and Commercial Library. In 1951, the building was refurbished to host the Legislative Council. Under the 1969 Constitution, the House of Assembly was established, superseding the Legislative Council. The first session of the House of Assembly was opened on 28 August 1969 by the then Governor, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Varyl Begg.

==Current membership==
The 17 Members of the Gibraltar Parliament, as of the 2023 election, are:

<text>Heraios (Bactrian: Ηλου &quot;Ēlou&quot;, sometimes Heraus, Heraos, Miaos) was apparently a king or clan chief of the Kushans (reign: 1 –30 CE), one of the five constituent tribes of the Yuezhi, in Bactria, in the early 1st century CE.

Several scholars question his existence as a separate historical figure and suggest that &quot;Heraios&quot; may have been another name for his nominal successor Kujula Kadphises. For example, numismatist Joe Cribb points out the similarity of coins minted by Kujula to those of a Greco-Bactrian predecessor named Hermaios Soter (or Hermaeus Soter). Moreover, some portraits of Kujula resemble Hermaios, suggesting that Kujula may have initially reused the design of coins issued during the reign of Hermaios Soter.

The coins bearing the name Heraios were silver and made in the Hellenistic style, using the Greek script. The reverse shows the winged Greek goddess of victory Nike holding out a wreath, over Heraios mounted on a horse. He wears a tunic and has a large bow on the side. Some portraits show Heraios with a marked artificial skull deformation, a characteristic of several Kushan portraits and sculptures of the 1st century CE. On some of the Heraios coins, his name has sometimes been read as ΗΛΟΥ or ΗΙΛΟΥ, which has been transliterated as &quot;Ilou&quot;. However other readings of the same texts include &quot;Ηaou&quot; and &quot;Ηiaou&quot;.

<doc id="826741" wikidata="Q7698746" url="?curid=826741" title="Temple of Peace, Cardiff">
<text>The Welsh National Temple of Peace and Health, known as the Temple of Peace and Health () or commonly the Temple of Peace (), is a non-religious civic building in Cathays Park, Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. It was designed by the architect Sir Percy Thomas. Since its foundation, the building has served a dual function as headquarters for health and international affairs organisations.

==Facilities==
The building&#x27;s conference and seminar facilities include the 200 capacity Marble Hall, the 50 capacity wood-panelled Council Chamber and a smaller 20 capacity meeting room. The venue has parking nearby and is within walking distance of the northern city centre. It can also be reached by rail transport from Cathays railway station.

==History==

The Temple of Peace and Health was the brainchild of David Davies, 1st Baron Davies, and was conceived to serve two purposes. The first was to provide a home for the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association, a voluntary organisation dedicated to the prevention, treatment and eradication of tuberculosis, which Davies had founded in 1910. Davies was also the founding president of the Welsh National Council of the League of Nations Union, and in 1934 he pledged £58,000 () towards the erection of a building to house the two organisations.

Davies wanted the Temple of Peace and Health to be &quot;a memorial to those gallant men from all nations who gave their lives in the war that was to end war&quot;, so it was dedicated to the memory of those who died in that war.

In founding the Temple, Davies intended to combine the goals of peace and health and to express these ideals in the architectural design of the building. The building&#x27;s architect, Sir Percy Thomas, was awarded the bronze medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects for its design. The foundation stone was laid by Viscount Halifax in 1937. The building opened on 23 November 1938, with a ceremony that featured Minnie James of Dowlais, who lost three of her sons in World War I.

The Temple of Peace and Health was bombed in July 1968 by Welsh nationalists in protest at the approaching investiture of Prince Charles (now Charles III) as Prince of Wales.

In 2018, Cardiff University bought the Temple of Peace from Public Health Wales, although the Welsh Centre for International Affairs remains as leaseholder of part of the building.

== Building ==


The building is in the form of the letter T, with two wings, and is built of Portland stone. The roofs of the wings are dark red Italian pattern tiles. The wings contain offices and committee rooms, on three levels.

===Marble Hall===

The central portion of the building, being deliberately higher than the wings, houses the spacious Marble Hall. Situated on the ground floor and facing the main entrance, it is lined with dove-grey marble to symbolise the emblem of peace. It serves as a meeting place of cultural and social organisations, with many lectures and conferences on international issues having been held here; it is also a venue for campaigning groups and social events.

===The Crypt and the Welsh National Book of Remembrance===

Situated immediately below the Temple Hall, the Crypt houses a Book of Remembrance for those who died in World War I. It is 1,100 pages long and contains the names of 35,000 men and women who were of Welsh birth or parentage or served in Welsh regiments. As most died on Belgian or French soil, the bronze used on the glass casing of the book is French, and the marble pedestal on which it rests is from Belgium. Concealed lighting illuminates the book from the roof of the Crypt.

===Council Chamber===

The Council Chamber is a wood-panelled room on the first floor of the building. It is used as a meeting place, and also houses many books with international themes, including part of Davies&#x27; own book collection.

== Use as a filming location ==
Much of the 2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The End of the World&quot; was filmed in the Marble Hall and other parts of the building. The location was used to represent a space station five billion years in the future. The hall was also used in the episodes &quot;Gridlock&quot; (2007), &quot;The Fires of Pompeii&quot; (2008), &quot;Cold Blood&quot; (2010), &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Hitler&quot; (2011) and &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot; (2013).

The building has also been used as a filming location for other television shows, including the 2010 &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;The Blind Banker&quot; and &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;.

<doc id="826743" wikidata="Q1470048" url="?curid=826743" title="MU330">
<text>MU330 is an American ska punk band from St. Louis, Missouri. Formed by students of St. Louis University High School in 1988, MU330 played a self-described brand of music called &quot;psycho ska&quot;, high energy ska punk marked by manic performances and humorous, often strange lyricism. 

Since 1997, the band&#x27;s musical direction has changed towards a more melodic and lyric-driven ska/indie rock sound, a combination that has been described as &quot;Weezer meets The Specials&quot;.

Dan Potthast (guitar/vocals), Ted Moll (drums), Chris Diebold (bass guitar), and Robert Bell (trombone) have remained with MU330 since the band&#x27;s inception, and the trombonist Gerry Lundquist has been a member for over two decades. There have been several different frontmen in the past, but Potthast has always been the band&#x27;s principal songwriter and lyricist.

==Biography==

The original members met in St. Louis University High School music class 330, hence the band&#x27;s name.

Potthast has released solo work and has also started a second band, The Stitch Up, with the former Slow Gherkin frontman, James Rickman. He also started a ska/rocksteady group called Dan P and the Bricks with former the MU330 saxophonist, Matt Knobbe. 

In 2018, Potthast was part of Jeff Rosenstock&#x27;s touring band. Moll, the drummer, has a side project band called Bagheera. Most members of MU330 have performed with Mike Park&#x27;s Bruce Lee Band throughout the band&#x27;s history, although Potthast is the only member who has played live with The Bruce Lee Band in the past few years. MU330 continues to perform live sporadically across the United States.

<text>Thomas J. Armat (October 25, 1866 – September 30, 1948) was an American mechanic and inventor, a pioneer of cinema best known through the co-invention of the Edison Vita

Armat studied at the Mechanics Institute in Richmond, Virginia and then in 1894 at the Bliss Electrical School in Washington, D.C., where he met Charles Francis Jenkins. The two classmates teamed up to develop a movie projector using a new kind of intermittent motion mechanism, a &quot;beater mechanism&quot; similar to the one patented 1893 by Georges Demenÿ in France. It was one of the first projectors using what is known as the Latham loop (an extra loop of the film before the transport mechanism to reduce the tension on the film and avoid film breakage, developed independently at the same time by Woodville Latham and his sons). They made their first public projection using their invention, named Phantoscope after an earlier model designed by Jenkins alone, in September 1895 at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta.

Following this success, the two co-inventors broke up over patent issues. Jenkins tried to claim sole inventorship, but was turned down and sold out to Armat, who subsequently joined and sold the patent to Thomas Edison, who marketed the machine as the &#x27;Vitascope&#x27;. The projector was used in a public screening in New York City beginning April 23, 1896 and lasting more than a week.

Working for Edison, Armat refined the projector in 1897 by replacing the beater mechanism with a more precise Geneva drive, duplicating an invention made a year earlier in Germany by Oskar Messter and Max Griewe and in England by Robert William Paul.

In 1947, Armat and William Nicholas Selig, Albert E. Smith and George Kirke Spoor were awarded a Special Academy Award as representatives of the movie pioneers for their contributions to the film business.

He died on September 30, 1948.

In 2011, he was inducted, posthumously, into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

<text>Oskar Messter (21 November 1866 – 6 December 1943) was a German inventor and film tycoon in the early years of cinema. His firm Messter Film was one of the dominant German producers before the rise of UFA, into which it was ultimately merged.

==Biography==
Oskar Messter was born on November 21, 1866, in Berlin, where his father had founded in 1859 a company called &quot;Optisches und Mechanisches Institut Ed. Messter&quot;. This company manufactured and sold eyeglasses, precision medical devices, optical devices for magicians and show businessmen, electric reflectors for theaters, and projectors for the magic lantern. Being integrated in this world since he was a child, Oskar acquired both business, optical and mechanical skills, which he later applied in cinematography.

In 1892, his father&#x27;s workshops became part of Oskar and he began to carry out his own experiments. Following in the footsteps of Filoteo Alberini with the &quot;kinetograph&quot;, Robert William Paul with the &quot;theatrograph&quot;, Birt Acres with the &quot;magic lantern&quot; in 1896, among many others, Messter managed to develop his first projector to retransmit films of Thomas Alva Edison&#x27;s &quot;kinetoscope&quot;.

Later, he was chosen to repair a &quot;theatrograph&quot;, but abandoned it to focus on a better development of the &quot;kinetoscope&quot;, first adding a &quot;Geneva drive&quot; on the projectors to oscillatingly cause intermittent movement to advance the frames of the film. That being the case, on June 15, 1896, Oskar sold his first device. But Messter was not the only producer of film projectors in Germany. Robert W. Paul in London built projectors independently using this same mechanism for the advancement of the film almost at the same time, or Georg Bartling, belonging to the company of &quot;GmbH&quot;, exhibited a projector at the &quot;Industrial Exhibition of Berlin&quot; in 1896.

In the middle of 1896, Messter began to produce in series cameras and film projectors that were very successful. By the end of 1896, &quot;Messters-Projection Berlin&quot; had produced 64 projectors: 42 of these were sold in Germany and 22, in the rest of Europe. In just four years, the company&#x27;s profits multiplied tenfold. Also in 1896, Messter rented a small theater that had gone bankrupt and inaugurated the second cinema hall in Berlin, since the first one was opened by the envoys of the Lumière brothers that precise year. Subsequently, Messter debuted at the &quot;Apollo&quot;, a Berlin variety theater, and organized a film projection service. Also at the end of 1896, Messter entered the business of film production, creating his first films, such as &quot;A Skater at the West Railway Station&quot; (1896) and &quot;At the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin&quot; (1896).

In 1916, Oskar Messter founded with the director of cinema Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky, the &quot;Wiener Sascha-Messter Film GmbH&quot;, Viennese daughter of the &quot;Messter-Film GmbH&quot;. However, at the end of the First World War, Messter sold his companies in Berlin and Vienna to the newly founded &quot;Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (UFA).

He donated his collection of historical film equipment to the German Museum in 1932. Messter died in 1943 in Tegernsee.

== Contributions ==
 Oskar Messter was characterized for having an innovative mentality that he knew how to apply to the exploration of the new medium of cinematography, whether for scientific purposes or for commercial purposes. Among his most indicated contributions are:

* The slow motion photograph of the blossoming of flowers in early 1897.
* Various experiments in microscopic cinematography made between 1900 and 1910.
* Construction of the first film studio in Germany in 1900, which had artificial lighting with four lamps, where you could work independently of sunlight and time. In 1901, he moved the studio to another very similar location due to the space available. Later, in 1905 Messter adapted a glass &quot;atelier&quot; or workshop as a cinema studio with double height and adjacent rooms to store the sets and costumes of each performance. In this new study, he did depend on natural lighting, although he gradually began to use arc reflectors that allowed him to work with a mixed light. However, after some years this study proved insufficient and he rented two more floors to build a hanging structure, which had an electric motor to move the reflectors or the cameras around the stage.
* The first projections voiced in Germany in 1903.
* The equipment of its electromechanical synchronization system with the &quot;Tonbilder&quot; biophon in more than 500 cinemas between 1905 and 1913. It was an electromechanical synchronization mechanism that consisted of an electrical system that operated at the same speed the motors of a movie projector and a gramophone.
* The presentation of films spoken in English at the &quot;World Fair in Saint Louis,&quot; Missouri, United States in 1904.
* The realization a total of three hundred and twenty six silent films between 1896 and 1918. Until 1910, all of them were short films of very short duration and from 1911, they were already medium-length films and feature films.
* The construction of &quot;stardom&quot; through the promotion of the actress Henny Porten from 1910 to 1918.
* The market introduction of the standard &quot;Thaumatograph Modell XVII&quot; projector from 1914.
* The foundation of the film newscast &quot;Die Messters-Wochenschau&quot; (1914)
* The manufacture of high-speed military reconnaissance cameras in 1915.
* The organization of the &quot;German Technical-Cinematographic Societ&quot;y.
* The reorganization of its cinematographic activities in a consortium made up of three companies differentiated in 1901: the &quot;Messters-Projection GmbH&quot;, for the production and distribution of films; the &quot;Vereinigte Mechanische Werkstätten GmbH&quot;, for the manufacture of optical-mechanical equipment; and the &quot;Kosmograph Compagnie GmbH&quot;, for the exhibition of films in variety theaters.

== Early sound films ==
From 1896, Messter was interested in the search of a method of reproduction and synchronization of the sound effects of the cinematographic performance at the time of the &quot;silent movies&quot;. So Messter invented the &quot;Tonbilder&quot; Biophon to show films, in which a gramophone played &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; accompanying the projection of animated images, but it was not a simple &quot;accompaniment&quot; but to precisely match the series of musical pieces with moving images. In effect, to add sound to the silent cinema it was necessary to solve problems of synchronization, since the image and the sound were recorded and reproduced by separated devices, which were difficult to initiate and to maintain rigged. On August 31, 1903, Messter held the first sound projection that took place in Germany at the &quot;Apollo&quot; Theater in Berlin. The inventor of the Biophon can be congratulated of belonging to the modern world.

Until 1907 the Tonbilder branch of the German film industry was dominated by Oskar Messter, who had reached the following agreement with Léon Gaumont that Gaumont would not supply &quot;Phonoscènes&quot; to Germany and Messter would not provide &quot;Tonbilder&quot; biophons to France, and that their respective devices would be sold by a joint consortium called &quot;Gaumont-Messter-Chronophone-Biophon&quot;. Messter&#x27;s &quot;Tonbilders&quot; sold well while he kept his technical superiority over other film producers in Germany.

<text>Nora Chesson (2 January 1871 – 14 April 1906) was an English journalist and poet. She won for herself a distinct celebrity as a contributor to most of the English periodicals and newspapers of her time.

==Biography==
Eleanor Jane Hopper was born in Exeter, on 2 January 1871. Her father, Capt. Harman Baillie Hopper, was Irish. She was a participant in the Irish literary movement of the 1890s, having some influence on W. B. Yeats in particular with her &quot;Ballads in Prose&quot; (1894).

Her career as an author of poetry and prose began in 1887 when she was not quite seventeen years of age. She went on to increase her literary reputation until her death. In some of her poems, there was an atmosphere of melancholy which might seem as if it cast upon them the shadow of a too-early death. She provided the English translation to Thadgh O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s libretto for the Irish opera &quot;Muirgheis&quot; (1903) by Thomas O&#x27;Brien Butler (1861–1915).

In 1901, she married the English man of letters Wilfrid Hugh Chesson (1870–1953). She died from heart failure at her home in North Sheen on 14 April 1906. Five volumes of her selected poems were published that year by Alston Rivers, of London, which included a short biographical note by the editor, her husband, and an introductory appreciation by Ford Madox Hueffer.

<text>Dr Joseph John Andrew Garcia is a Gibraltarian historian and politician, and the current leader of the Liberal Party of Gibraltar (LPG) and Deputy Chief Minister of the Government of Gibraltar. The LPG holds two of the 17 seats in the Gibraltar Parliament after the 2023 general election and is in government with its political allies, the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP).

==Education==
Garcia graduated from the University of Hull in England with a first class honours degree in history and obtained a doctorate on &quot;The Political and Constitutional Development of Gibraltar&quot;.

==Political career==
Garcia has been leader of the LPG since 1992 and was first elected to the then Gibraltar House of Assembly on a by-election. He served as Shadow Minister for Tourism and Commercial Affairs from 1999 to 2000. He was re-elected at the 2000 election and served as Shadow Minister for Trade, Industry, Tourism and Financial Services until 2003. In 2011 Garcia was appointed Vice President of Liberal International. Garcia&#x27;s party then formed a coalition to contest the 2003 election with the GSLP, which won five seats, re-electing Garcia to serve as Shadow Minister for Trade, Industry, Tourism and Heritage until 2007 when he was again re-elected at the 2007 election serving in the same Shadow Ministry.

After 12 years in opposition, Garcia was elected into Government following the election of 8 December 2011. The newly elected GSLP Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, appointed Garcia Deputy Chief Minister with responsibility for planning and lands, political, democratic and civic reform, and civil aviation.

During the general election campaign in 1996 Garcia ripped up the GSLP manifesto during a leaders debate programme on GBC. His party now forms the Government with the GSLP.

Garcia supported Panorama which was a daily newspaper in Gibraltar. His father Joe Garcia Snr. MBE (1938-2022) was the founder and editor of the paper until his death. He was succeeded by his sister, Lorraine Baldachino (until dissolution). 

Garcia was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to politics and public service in Gibraltar.
