<text>The Plantation of Ulster (; Ulster Scots: ) was the organised colonisation (&quot;plantation&quot;) of Ulstera province of Irelandby people from Great Britain during the reign of King James VI and I. 

Small privately funded plantations by wealthy landowners began in 1606, while the official plantation began in 1609. Most of the land had been confiscated from the native Gaelic chiefs, several of whom had fled Ireland for mainland Europe in 1607 following the Nine Years&#x27; War against English rule. The official plantation comprised an estimated half a million acres (2,000 km2) of arable land in counties Armagh, Cavan, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal, and Londonderry. Land in counties Antrim, Down, and Monaghan was privately colonised with the king&#x27;s support.

Among those involved in planning and overseeing the plantation were King James, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Arthur Chichester, and the Attorney-General for Ireland, John Davies. They saw the plantation as a means of controlling, anglicising, and &quot;civilising&quot; Ulster. The province was almost wholly Gaelic, Catholic, and rural and had been the region most resistant to English control. The plantation was also meant to sever the ties of the Gaelic clans of Ulster with those from the Highlands of Scotland, as it meant a strategic threat to England. The colonists (or &quot;British tenants&quot;) were required to be English-speaking, Protestant, and loyal to the king. Some of the landlords and settlers, however, were Catholic. The Scottish settlers were mostly Presbyterian Lowlanders and the English settlers were mostly Anglican Northerners, which their culture differed from that of the native Irish. Although some &quot;loyal&quot; natives were granted land, the native Irish reaction to the plantation was generally hostile, and native writers lamented what they saw as the decline of Gaelic society and the influx of foreigners.

The Plantation of Ulster was the biggest of the plantations of Ireland. It led to the founding of many of Ulster&#x27;s towns and created a lasting Ulster Protestant community in the province with ties to Britain. It also resulted in many of the native Irish nobility losing their land and led to centuries of ethnic and sectarian animosity, which at times spilled into conflict, notably in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and, more recently, the Troubles.

==Ulster before plantation==

Before the plantation, Ulster had been the most Gaelic province of Ireland, as it was the least anglicised and the most independent of English control. The region was almost wholly rural and had few towns or villages. Throughout the 16th century, Ulster was viewed by the English as being &quot;underpopulated&quot; and undeveloped. The economy of Gaelic Ulster was overwhelmingly based on agriculture, especially cattle-raising. Many of the Gaelic Irish practised &quot;creaghting&quot; or &quot;booleying&quot;, a kind of transhumance whereby some of them moved with their cattle to upland pastures during the summer months and lived in temporary dwellings during that time. This often led outsiders to mistakenly believe the Gaelic Irish were nomadic.

The population of Ulster before the Plantation has been estimated to be around 180,000-200,000. This was after the destruction caused by the devastating famine and warfare at the end of the Nine Years War. Michael Perceval-Maxwell estimated that by 1600 Ulster&#x27;s total adult population was only 25,000-40,000. The war fought between the native Irish Confederacy and the English Crown undoubtedly contributed to depopulation, with 60,000 reported dead by famine and attacks on the civilian population.

The Tudor conquest of Ireland began in the 1540s, during the reign of Henry VIII (1509–1547), and concluded in the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) sixty years later, breaking the power of the semi-independent Irish chieftains. As part of the conquest, plantations (colonial settlements) were established in Queen&#x27;s County and King&#x27;s County (Laois and Offaly) in the 1550s as well as Munster in the 1580s, and in 1568 Warham St Leger and Richard Grenville established Joint stock/Cooperate colonies in Cork, although these were not very successful.

In the 1570s, Elizabeth I authorised a privately funded plantation of eastern Ulster, led by Thomas Smith and Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. This was a failure and sparked violent conflict with the local Irish lord, in which Lord Deputy Essex killed many of the lord of Clandeboy&#x27;s kin.

In the Nine Years&#x27; War of 1594–1603, an alliance of northern Gaelic chieftains—led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill of Tyrone, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell of Tyrconnell, and Hugh Maguire of Fermanagh—resisted the imposition of English government in Ulster and sought to affirm their own control. Following an extremely costly series of campaigns by the English the war ended in 1603 with the Treaty of Mellifont. The terms of surrender granted to what remained of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces were considered generous at the time.

After the Treaty of Mellifont, the northern chieftains attempted to consolidate their positions, whilst some within the English administration attempted to undermine them. In 1607, O&#x27;Neill and his primary allies left Ireland to seek Spanish help for a new rebellion to restore their privileges, in what became known as the Flight of the Earls. King James issued a proclamation declaring their action to be treason, paving the way for the forfeiture of their lands and titles.

==Planning the plantation==

A colonization of Ulster had been proposed since the end of the Nine Years&#x27; War. The original proposals were smaller, involving planting settlers around key military posts and on church land, and would have included large land grants to native Irish lords who sided with the English during the war, such as Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell. However, in 1608 Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty of Inishowen launched a rebellion, capturing and burning the town of Derry. The brief rebellion was ended by Sir Richard Wingfield at the Battle of Kilmacrennan. The rebellion prompted Arthur Chichester, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, to plan a much bigger plantation and to expropriate the legal titles of all native landowners in the province. John Davies, the Attorney-General for Ireland, used the law as a tool of conquest and colonization. Before the Flight of the Earls, the English administration had sought to minimise the personal estates of the chieftains, but now they treated the chieftains as sole owners of their whole territories, so that all the land could be confiscated. Most of this land was deemed to be forfeited (or escheated) to the Crown because the chieftains were declared to be attainted. English judges had also declared that titles to land held under gavelkind, the native Irish custom of inheriting land, had no standing under English law. Davies used this as a means to confiscate land, when other means failed.

The Plantation of Ulster was presented to James I as a joint &quot;British&quot;, or English and Scottish, venture to &#x27;pacify&#x27; and &#x27;civilise&#x27; Ulster, with half the settlers to be from one country. James had been King of Scotland before he also became King of England and wanted to reward his Scottish subjects with land in Ulster to assure them they were not being neglected now that he had moved his court to London. Long-standing contacts between Ulster and the west of Scotland meant that Scottish participation was a practical necessity. James saw the Gaels as barbarous and rebellious, and believed Gaelic culture should be wiped out. For centuries, Scottish Gaelic mercenaries called gallowglass () had been migrating to Ireland to serve under the Irish chiefs. Another goal of the plantation was to sever the ties of the Gaelic clans of Ulster with those from the Highlands of Scotland, as these ties posed a strategic threat to England.

Six counties were involved in the official plantationDonegal, Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan and Armagh. In the two officially unplanted counties of Antrim and Down, substantial Presbyterian Scots settlement had been underway since 1606.

The plan for the plantation was determined by two factors. One was the wish to make sure the settlement could not be destroyed by rebellion as the first Munster Plantation had been in the Nine Years&#x27; War. This meant that, rather than settling the planters in isolated pockets of land confiscated from the Irish, all of the land would be confiscated and then redistributed to create concentrations of British settlers around new towns and garrisons.

What was more, the new landowners were explicitly banned from taking Irish tenants and had to import workers from England and Scotland. The remaining Irish landowners were to be granted one quarter of the land in Ulster. The peasant Irish population was intended to be relocated to live near garrisons and Protestant churches. Moreover, the planters were barred from selling their lands to any Irishman and were required to build defences against any possible rebellion or invasion. The settlement was to be completed within three years. In this way, it was hoped that a defensible new community composed entirely of loyal British subjects would be created.

The second major influence on the Plantation was the negotiation among various interest groups on the British side. The principal landowners were to be &quot;Undertakers&quot;, wealthy men from England and Scotland who undertook to import tenants from their own estates. They were granted around 3000 acres (12 km2) each, on condition that they settle a minimum of 48 adult males (including at least 20 families), who had to be English-speaking and Protestant. Veterans of the Nine Years&#x27; War (known as &quot;Servitors&quot;) led by Arthur Chichester successfully lobbied to be rewarded with land grants of their own.

Since these former officers did not have enough private capital to fund the colonisation, their involvement was subsidised by the twelve great guilds. Livery companies from the City of London were coerced into investing in the project, as were City of London guilds which were granted land on the west bank of the River Foyle, to build their own city on the site of Derry (renamed Londonderry after them) as well as lands in County Coleraine. They were known jointly as The Honourable The Irish Society. The final major recipient of lands was the Protestant Church of Ireland, which was granted all the churches and lands previously owned by the Roman Catholic Church. The British government intended that clerics from England and the Pale would convert the native population to Anglicanism.

==Implementing the plantation==

Since 1606, there had been substantial lowland Scots settlement on disinhabited land in north Down, led by Hugh Montgomery and James Hamilton. In 1607, Sir Randall MacDonnell settled 300 Presbyterian Scots families on his land in Antrim.

From 1609 onwards, British Protestant colonists arrived in Ulster through direct importation by Undertakers to their estates and also by a spread to unpopulated areas, through ports such as Derry and Carrickfergus. In addition, there was much internal movement of settlers who did not like the original land allotted to them. Some planters settled on uninhabited and unexploited land, often building up their farms and homes on overgrown terrain that has been variously described as &quot;wilderness&quot; and &quot;virgin&quot; ground. In 1612, William Cole received a grant of land to establish a settler town at Enniskillen.

By 1622, a survey found that there were 6,402 British adult males on Plantation lands, of whom 3,100 were English and 3,700 Scottish – indicating a total adult planter population of around 12,000. However, another 4,000 Scottish adult males had settled in unplanted Antrim and Down, giving a total settler population of about 19,000.

Despite the fact that the Plantation had decreed that the Irish population be displaced, this did not generally happen in practice. Firstly, some 300 native landowners who had taken the English side in the Nine Years&#x27; War were rewarded with land grants. Secondly, the majority of the Gaelic Irish remained in their native areas, but were now only allowed worse land than before the plantation. They usually lived close to and even in the same townlands as the settlers and the land they had farmed previously. The main reason for this was that Undertakers could not import enough English or Scottish tenants to fill their agricultural workforce and had to fall back on Irish tenants. However, in a few heavily populated lowland areas (such as parts of north Armagh) it is likely that some population displacement occurred.

However, the Plantation remained threatened by the attacks of bandits, known as &quot;wood-kern&quot;, who were often Irish soldiers or dispossessed landowners. In 1609, Chichester had 1,300 former Gaelic soldiers deported from Ulster to serve in the Swedish Army. As a result, military garrisons were established across Ulster and many of the Plantation towns, notably Derry, were fortified. The settlers were also required to maintain arms and attend an annual military &#x27;muster&#x27;.

There had been very few towns in Ulster before the Plantation. Most modern towns in the province can date their origins back to this period. Plantation towns generally have a single broad main street ending in a square in a design often known as a &quot;diamond&quot;, which can be seen in communities like The Diamond, Donegal.

===Failures===
The plantation was a mixed success from the point of view of the settlers. About the time the Plantation of Ulster was planned, the Virginia Plantation at Jamestown in 1607 started. The London guilds planning to fund the Plantation of Ulster switched and backed the London Virginia Company instead. Many British Protestant settlers went to Virginia or New England in America rather than to Ulster.

By the 1630s, there were 20,000 adult male British settlers in Ulster, which meant that the total settler population could have been as high as 80,000. They formed local majorities of the population in the Finn and Foyle valleys (around modern County Londonderry and east Donegal), in north Armagh and in east Tyrone. Moreover, the unofficial settlements in Antrim and Down were thriving. The settler population grew rapidly, as just under half of the planters were women.

The attempted conversion of the Irish to Protestantism was generally a failure. One problem was language difference. The Protestant clerics imported were usually all monoglot English speakers, whereas the native population were usually monoglot Irish speakers. However, ministers chosen to serve in the plantation were required to take a course in the Irish language before ordination, and nearly 10% of those who took up their preferments spoke it fluently. Nevertheless, conversion was rare, despite the fact that, after 1621, Gaelic Irish natives could be officially classed as British if they converted to Protestantism. Of those Catholics who did convert to Protestantism, many made their choice for social and political reasons.

The reaction of the native Irish to the plantation was generally hostile. Chichester wrote in 1610 that the native Irish in Ulster were &quot;generally discontented, and repine greatly at their fortunes, and the small quantity of land left to them&quot;. That same year, English army officer Toby Caulfield wrote that &quot;there is not a more discontented people in Christendom&quot; than the Ulster Irish. Irish Gaelic writers bewailed the plantation. In an entry for the year 1608, the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; states that the land was &quot;taken from the Irish&quot; and given &quot;to foreign tribes&quot;, and that Irish chiefs were &quot;banished into other countries where most of them died&quot;. Likewise, an early 17th-century poem by the Irish bard Lochlann Óg Ó Dálaigh laments the plantation, the displacement of the native Irish, and the decline of Gaelic culture. It asks &quot;Where have the Gaels gone?&quot;, adding &quot;We have in their stead an arrogant, impure crowd, of foreigners&#x27; blood&quot;.

Historian Thomas Bartlett suggests that Irish hostility to the plantation may have been muted in the early years, as there were much fewer settlers arriving than expected. Bartlett writes that a hatred for the planters grew with the influx of settlers from the 1620s, and the increasing marginalization of the Irish. Historian Gerard Farrell writes that the plantation stoked a &quot;smoldering resentment&quot; in the Irish, among whom &quot;a widespread perception persisted that they and the generation before them had been unfairly dispossessed of their lands by force and legal chicanery&quot;. Petty violence and sabotage against the planters was rife, and many Irish came to identify with the wood-kern who attacked settlements and ambushed settlers. Ferrell suggests it took many years for an Irish uprising to happen because there was depopulation, because many native leaders had been removed, and those who remained only belatedly realised the threat of the plantation.

==Wars of the Three Kingdoms==
By the 1630s it is suggested that the plantation was settling down with &quot;tacit religious tolerance&quot;, and in every county Old Irish were serving as royal officials and members of the Irish Parliament. However, in the 1640s, the Ulster Plantation was thrown into turmoil by civil wars that raged in Ireland, England and Scotland. The wars saw Irish rebellion against the planters, twelve years of bloody war, and ultimately the re-conquest of the province by the English parliamentary New Model Army that confirmed English and Protestant dominance in the province.

After 1630, Scottish migration to Ireland waned for a decade. In the 1630s, Presbyterians in Scotland staged a rebellion against Charles I for trying to impose Anglicanism. The same was attempted in Ireland, where most Scots colonists were Presbyterian. A large number of them returned to Scotland as a result. Charles I subsequently raised an army largely composed of Irish Catholics, and sent them to Ulster in preparation to invade Scotland. The English and Scottish parliaments then threatened to attack this army. In the midst of this, Gaelic Irish landowners in Ulster, led by Felim O&#x27;Neill and Rory O&#x27;More, planned a rebellion to take over the administration in Ireland.

On 23 October 1641, the Ulster Catholics staged a rebellion. The mobilised natives turned on the British colonists, massacring about 4,000 and expelling about 8,000 more. Marianne Elliott believes that &quot;1641 destroyed the Ulster Plantation as a mixed settlement&quot;. The initial leader of the rebellion, Felim O&#x27;Neill, had actually been a beneficiary of the Plantation land grants. Most of his supporters&#x27; families had been dispossessed and were likely motivated by the desire to recover their ancestral lands. Many colonists who survived rushed to the seaports and went back to Great Britain.

The massacres made a lasting impression on psyche of the Ulster Protestant population. A. T. Q. Stewart states that &quot;The fear which it inspired survives in the Protestant subconscious as the memory of the Penal Laws or the Famine persists in the Catholic.&quot; He also believed that &quot;Here, if anywhere, the mentality of siege was born, as the warning bonfires blazed from hilltop to hilltop, and the beating drums summoned men to the defence of castles and walled towns crowded with refugees.&quot;

In the summer of 1642, the Scottish Parliament sent some 10,000 soldiers to quell the Irish rebellion. In revenge for the massacres of Scottish colonists, the army committed many atrocities against the Catholic population. Based in Carrickfergus, the Scottish army fought against the rebels until 1650, although much of the army was destroyed by the Irish forces at the Battle of Benburb in 1646. In the northwest of Ulster, the colonists around Derry and east Donegal organised the Laggan Army in self-defence. The British forces fought an inconclusive war with the Ulster Irish led by Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill. All sides committed atrocities against civilians in this war, exacerbating the population displacement begun by the Plantation.

In addition to fighting the Ulster Irish, the British settlers fought each other in 1648–49 over the issues of the English Civil War. The Scottish Presbyterian army sided with the King and the Laggan Army sided with the English Parliament. In 1649–50, the New Model Army, along with some of the British colonists under Charles Coote, defeated both the Scottish forces and the Ulster Irish.

As a result, the English Parliamentarians (or Cromwellians) were generally hostile to Scottish Presbyterians after they re-conquered Ireland from the Catholic Confederates in 1649–53. The main beneficiaries of the postwar Cromwellian settlement were English Protestants like Sir Charles Coote, who had taken the Parliament&#x27;s side over the King or the Scottish Presbyterians. The Wars eliminated the last major Catholic landowners in Ulster.

==Continued migration from Scotland to Ulster==
Most Scottish planters came from southwest Scotland, but many also came from the unstable regions along the border with England. The plan was that moving Borderers (see Border Reivers) to Ireland (particularly to County Fermanagh) would both solve the Border problem and tie down Ulster. This was of particular concern to James VI of Scotland when he became King of England, since he knew Scottish instability could jeopardise his chances of ruling both kingdoms effectively.

Another wave of Scottish immigration to Ulster took place in the 1690s, when tens of thousands of Scots fled a famine (1696–1698) in the border region of Scotland. It was at this point that Scottish Presbyterians became the majority community in the province. Whereas in the 1660s, they made up some 20% of Ulster&#x27;s population (though 60% of its British population) by 1720 they were an absolute majority in Ulster, with up to 50,000 having arrived during the period 1690–1710. There was continuing English migration throughout this period, particularly the 1650s and 1680s, notably amongst these settlers were the Quakers from the North of England, who contributed greatly to the cultivation of flax and linen. In total, during the half century between 1650 and 1700, 100,000 British settlers migrated to Ulster, just over half of which were English.

Despite the fact that Scottish Presbyterians strongly supported the Williamites in the Williamite war in Ireland in the 1690s, they were excluded from power in the postwar settlement by the Anglican Protestant Ascendancy. During the 18th century, rising Scots resentment over religious, political and economic issues fueled their emigration to the American colonies, beginning in 1717 and continuing up to the 1770s. Scots-Irish from Ulster and Scotland and British from the borders region comprised the most numerous group of immigrants from Great Britain and Ireland to the colonies in the years before the American Revolution. An estimated 150,000 left northern Ireland. They settled first mostly in Pennsylvania and western Virginia, from where they moved southwest into the backcountry of the Upland South, the Ozarks and the Appalachian Mountains.

==Legacy==
The legacy of the Plantation remains disputed. According to one interpretation, it created a society segregated between native Catholics and settler Protestants in Ulster and created a Protestant and British concentration in north-east Ireland. This argument therefore sees the Plantation as one of the long-term causes of the Partition of Ireland in 1921, as the north-east remained as part of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland.

The densest Protestant settlement took place in the eastern counties of Antrim and Down, which were not part of the Plantation, whereas Donegal, in the west, was planted but did not become part of Northern Ireland.

Therefore, it is also argued that the Plantation itself was less important in the distinctiveness of the north-east of Ireland than natural population flow between Ulster and Scotland. A. T. Q. Stewart, a protestant from Belfast, concluded: &quot;The distinctive Ulster-Scottish culture, isolated from the mainstream of Catholic and Gaelic culture, would appear to have been created not by the specific and artificial plantation of the early seventeenth century, but by the continuous natural influx of Scottish settlers both before and after that episode ...&quot;

The Plantation of Ulster is also widely seen as the origin of mutually antagonistic Catholic/Irish and Protestant/British identities in Ulster. Richard English, an expert on the Irish Republican Army, has written that: &quot;not all of those of British background in Ireland owe their Irish residence to the Plantations ... yet the Plantation did produce a large British/English interest in Ireland, a significant body of Irish Protestants who were tied through religion and politics to English power.&quot;

Genetic analysis has revealed that, &quot;The distribution [of southwestern Scottish ancestry] in Northern Ireland mirrors the distributions of the Plantations of Ireland throughout the 17th century. Thus the cluster will have experienced some genetic isolation by religion from adjacent Irish populations in the intervening centuries.&quot;

The settlers also left a legacy in terms of language. The strong Ulster Scots dialect originated through the speech of Lowland Scots settlers evolving and being influenced by both Hiberno-English dialect and the Irish language. Seventeenth-century English settlers also contributed colloquial words that are still in current use in Ulster.

<text>The North Kent Marshes are in the far north of the county of Kent spanning dry and wet south banks and inlets of the Thames Estuary in south-east England. The marshes are one of 22 environmentally sensitive areas recognised by the UK&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). They are in the Thames Gateway regional planning area. They include the South Thames Estuary and Marshes biological SSSI.

==Governance==
The marshes are nearly contiguous and span the districts of Dartford, Gravesham, Medway, Swale and Canterbury.

They are protected in the Kent and Medway Structure Plan. In successive Local Plans, required by UK Planning Law they have been included, regard being had to their environmental benefit. The marshes serve as emergency natural flood protection for London.

==Ecology==
Most of the northern edge of Kent, west of the relatively modest Thanet peninsula, has been marshland for millennia. Steeper gravel beaches with hills behind and segments of low cliff in the east at Whitstable and Herne Bay form the most notable exceptions, along a stretch of about . The almost of marshes, in many places reaching inland, stretch from the large town of Dartford in the west, to the west of Whitstable in the east. In the centre of the marshes are the semi-suburban grouping of the Medway Towns: Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester. Sittingbourne and Faversham are also located on the marshes. The Saxon Shore Way runs along the coast of the marshes, and onwards to Hastings on the south coast.

The marshes have been recognised as one of the most important natural wetlands in northern Europe, and they are monitored by local landowners and wildlife custodians. According to the RSPB, up to 300,000 migrant birds use the mudflats of the Thames marshes as a haven each year in their migratory journeys between the Arctic and Africa.

The RSPB have acquired considerable stretches of Cliffe marshes on the Hoo peninsula. They maintain reserves at Cliffe pools, Northward hill, High Halstow and Elmley Marshes, Sheppey. The Medway Council&#x27;s riverside park at Gillingham is also managed, public-access marshland.

The North Kent Marshes&#x27; stable water level provides an important habitat for water vole. Shorne and Higham marshes, with parts of Cliffe and Cooling marsh, Allhallows and Grain marshes and Sheppey here are three of their thirteen main habitats in Britain.

==Cultural references==

* Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is partly set in the marshes.
* Books by Nicola Barker are set in the marshes.
* The Channel Four series &quot;Southcliffe&quot; (2013) was set in a market town amid the marshes. Most of the series was filmed in and around Faversham.

<doc id="839400" wikidata="Q1101219" url="?curid=839400" title="Levitation (Hawkwind album)">
<text>Levitation is the tenth studio album by English rock group Hawkwind, released in 1980. It peaked at No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart.

At the time of its release, band leader Dave Brock stated: &quot;with Levitation we’ve come full circle back to the style of our debut album. And that was the record which totally expressed our ideals and what we stood for.&quot; It is their first studio album after the departure of lead vocalist and lyricist Robert Calvert, and lyrics here tend to be cursory and the number of instrumentals is increased. It is also the only studio Hawkwind album to feature ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker and first for ex-Gong keyboardist Tim Blake, who would later return to the band and play on 2010&#x27;s &quot;Blood of the Earth&quot;.

==Recording==
The band, who consisted of the same personnel that had recorded the previous album &quot;Live Seventy Nine&quot;, entered Roundhouse Recording Studios in July and August 1980 to record this album. The studio had been newly equipped with a 3M Digital Mastering System by Bronze Records, making this one of the earliest rock albums to be recorded with the burgeoning digital recording technology.

During the recording, Dave Brock became dissatisfied with drummer Simon King&#x27;s inability to keep consistent tempo, claiming that &quot;he couldn&#x27;t play his drums properly &#x27;cos he was taking bad drugs&quot;, although King stated &quot;I simply wanted to get away. I was very heavily into drinking... and [after leaving I was] fixed on getting my family life together&quot;. They considered using a drum machine that was in the studio, but no one knew how to use it. Guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton&#x27;s wife Marion, who was press officer for Ginger Baker&#x27;s manager Roy Ward&#x27;s company, suggested approaching the drummer to contribute as a session player. He accepted the offer and completed his tracks in two days, surpassing expectations. Lloyd-Langton observed that &quot;he breezed through [&quot;Space Chase&quot;] straight away. I don&#x27;t think Simon could have played that... Ginger fitted the band like a glove. His style was just right for it.&quot; The band asked the drummer to remain with them, and despite having previously declared to the press his intentions of joining the newly reformed Atomic Rooster, he &quot;found the atmosphere during the sessions so fantastic that I immediately decided to stay with Hawkwind. For me it&#x27;s not just my umpteenth group, I&#x27;m determined to give it everything I’ve got. Hawkwind always have made timeless music, but you can definitely still hear the eighties in it.&quot;

==Promotion and tour==
A &quot;Fireman&#x27;s Ball&quot; benefit weekend for 30 and 31 August in a marquee in Cambridge had been arranged with Motörhead, Girlschool and Inner City Unit, but was cancelled by the City Corporation concerned about fire regulations and sanitary facilities.

The band undertook a 33-date tour of Britain and Ireland from 10 October through to 15 November to promote the album, with support from Vardis. Eight dates into the tour, Blake left after clashing with Brock over an incident leaving the hotel the morning after the Stoke concert. Blake&#x27;s technician, Paul &quot;Twink&quot; Noble (who had previously played with Here and Now and would later join Gong), took Blake&#x27;s place using Blake&#x27;s equipment, until a road accident forced him to leave the tour after another five dates. Keith Hale, who had been in Blood Donor and was writing and producing for Toyah, then joined the band for the remainder of the tour. The dates included an unlikely appearance on 6 November at Worthy Farm, being &quot;muddy... freezing [and] five miles from anywhere&quot;.

The band also undertook an additional eleven date tour of Britain between 12 and 22 December, with support from Leamington Spa NWOBHM group Chevy, the Lewisham Odeon concert on the 18 being professionally recorded. Brock pressed Bronze Records to release another live album from these tapes, but having just issued &quot;Live Seventy Nine&quot;, label head Gerry Bron declined stating of Hawkwind that &quot;they were a bit lazy, they constantly wanted to do live albums, so they wouldn&#x27;t have to write songs&quot;. The recordings were later issued on the albums &quot;Zones&quot; (1983), &quot;This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot; (1984) and &quot;Hawkwind Anthology&quot;. The 2009 deluxe re-issue of &quot;Levitation&quot; by Atomhenge Records includes a newly remixed version of the entire concert.

Before they set out on tour, Bronze recorded in-studio promotional videos of the group miming performances of &quot;Levitation&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Win the war&quot; and &quot;World of Tiers&quot;. On 14 February 1981, the band appeared on the German television programme &quot;Musikladen&quot; performing &quot;Motorway City&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Win the War&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Malcolm Dome reviewed the album for &quot;Record Mirror&quot; giving it full marks claiming it to be &quot;a vast improvement on the four albums recorded with Charisma... herald[ing] a return to the Hawkwlnd style of the early &#x27;70s... [and] a pleasure to have once more an album that uses blistering sci-fi imagery as an angry searchlight focusing on alternative thought&quot;. Dome felt &quot;Ginger Baker slot[s] in almost as it were second nature&quot;, highlights &quot;Dust of Time&quot; as &quot;mystically inspired Eastern melodies and atmospherically desolate synthesisers which engulf the JG Ballardesque&quot; and the album &quot;intersperse[s] the serious stuff with more lighthearted, whimsical instrumentals.&quot;

==Songs==
&quot;Levitation&quot; had been played during the band&#x27;s previous UK Winter 1979 tour and, although not included on the live album &quot;Live Seventy Nine&quot;, a bootleg version was later released on the &quot;Complete &#x27;79&quot; album. A live version from the Levitation tour was released on the album &quot;This is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot;. Terry Bickers named his band Levitation after this album. The song was also covered on &quot;My Kantele&quot; by Amorphis.

The band had wanted &quot;Motorway City&quot; to be released as the album&#x27;s single, but the record company preferred &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Win the War?&quot; instead. The track features lead guitarist Lloyd-Langton using an E-bow. It had been performed on the band&#x27;s previous UK Winter 1979 tour and included on the &quot;Live Seventy Nine&quot; album. A live version of this song from the Levitation tour was later issued in 1983 as a single from the &quot;Zones&quot; album.

&quot;Psychosis&quot; is an instrumental synthesiser piece by Harvey Bainbridge. It was included on the Levitation tour, a version being included, but not listed, on the album &quot;This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot;.

The title of &quot;World of Tiers&quot; is a reference to the &quot;World of Tiers&quot; series of science fiction novels by Philip José Farmer. An instrumental, it is reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Oh Well&quot;. It is another song that had been performed on the band&#x27;s previous UK Winter 1979 tour, a bootleg version was later released on the &quot;Complete &#x27;79&quot; album. A live version of this song from the Levitation tour was issued on the &quot;Hawkwind Anthology&quot; collection.

&quot;Prelude&quot; is an instrumental synthesiser piece by Tim Blake.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Win The War?&quot; was released as a single from this album backed by the non-album track &quot;Nuclear Toy&quot;. It too had been performed on the band&#x27;s previous UK Winter 1979 tour, a bootleg version was later released on the &quot;Complete &#x27;79&quot; album.

&quot;Space Chase&quot; is a fast-paced instrumental. A live version from the Levitation tour was released on the album &quot;This is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot;.

The title &quot;The 5th Second of Forever&quot; references Robert Calvert&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Space Ritual&quot; poem &quot;The Ten Seconds of Forever&quot;, and it was subtitled &quot;from the film&quot; on the album as a joke by the band, the song not having been used by any film.
It features a nylon stringed acoustic guitar intro and outro by Lloyd-Langton. A live version of this song from the Levitation tour was issued on the &quot;This is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot; album under the title &quot;Circles&quot;. Its lyrics have also been used under the title &quot;Circles&quot;, although with no musical similarity, overdubbed on Hawkwind at Watchfield Festival 1975 (&quot;Weird Tape 3&quot;) and on Dave Brock demos 1982 (&quot;Weird Tape 7&quot;).

&quot;Dust of Time&quot; was performed during the Levitation tour, and an edited instrumental version with an intro taken from the outro of &quot;The 5th Second of Forever&quot; was issued on the album &quot;Zones&quot; under the title &quot;The Island&quot;.

<text>The Indo-Scythians (also called Indo-Sakas) were a group of nomadic people of Iranic Scythian origin who migrated from Central Asia southward into the northwestern Indian subcontinent: the present-day South Asian regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Eastern Iran and northern India. The migrations persisted from the middle of the second century BCE to the fourth century CE.

The first Saka king in India was Maues/Moga (first century BCE) who established Saka power in Gandhara, the Indus Valley, and other regions. The Indo-Scythians extended their supremacy over the north-western subcontinent, conquering the Indo-Greeks and other local peoples. They were apparently subjugated by the Kushan Empire&#x27;s Kujula Kadphises or Kanishka. The Saka continued to govern as satrapies, forming the Northern Satraps and Western Satraps. The power of the Saka rulers began to decline during the 2nd century CE after the Indo-Scythians were defeated by the Satavahana emperor Gautamiputra Satakarni. Indo-Scythian rule in the northwestern subcontinent ended when the last Western Satrap, Rudrasimha III, was defeated by the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II in 395 CE.

The invasion of the northern Indian subcontinent by Scythian tribes from Central Asia, often referred to as the Indo-Scythian invasion, played a significant role in the history of the subcontinent and nearby regions. The Indo-Scythian war was triggered by the nomadic flight of Central Asians from conflict with tribes such as the Xiongnu in the second century CE, which had lasting effects on Bactria, Kabul and the Indian subcontinent and Rome and Parthia in the west. Ancient Roman historians, including Arrian and Claudius Ptolemy, have mentioned that the ancient Sakas (&quot;Sakai&quot;) were nomadic people. The first rulers of the Indo-Scythian kingdom were Maues (c. 85–60 BCE) and Vonones (c. 75–65 BCE).

== Origins ==

The ancestors of the Indo-Scythians are thought to have been Saka (Scythian) tribes. 
One group of Indo-European speakers that makes an early appearance on the Xinjiang stage is the Saka (Ch. Sai). Saka is more a generic term than a name for a specific state or ethnic group; Saka tribes were part of a cultural continuum of early nomads across Siberia and the Central Eurasian steppe lands from Xinjiang to the Black Sea. Like the Scythians whom Herodotus describes in book four of his &quot;History&quot; (&quot;Saka&quot; is an Iranian word equivalent to the Greek &quot;Scythes&quot;, and many scholars refer to them together as Saka-Scythian), Sakas were Iranian-speaking horse nomads who deployed chariots in battle, sacrificed horses, and buried their dead in barrows or mound tombs called kurgans.

The Saka of western India spoke the Saka language (also known as Khotanese), first documented in the Tarim Basin.

===Achaemenid period (6th-4th century BCE)===
During the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley BCE, the Achaemenid army was not Persian and the Saka probably participated in the invasion of northwest India. The Achaemenid army was composed of a number of ethnic groups who were part of the Achaemenid Empire. The army included Bactrians, Saka, Parthians, and Sogdians. Herodotus listed the ethnicities of the Achaemenid army, which included Ionians (Greeks) and Ethiopians. These groups were probably included in the Achaemenid army which invaded India.

Some scholars (including Michael Witzel) and Christopher I. Beckwith suggested that the Shakyathe clan of Gautama Buddhawere originally Scythians from Central Asia, and the Indian ethnonym &quot;Śākya&quot; has the same origin as &quot;Scythian&quot;. This would explain the strong Saka support of Buddhism in India.

The Persians, the Saka and the Greeks may have participated in the later campaigns of Chandragupta Maurya to gain the throne of Magadha BCE. The &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; says that after Alexander the Great&#x27;s death, Chandragupta Maurya used a Shaka-Yavana-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika alliance in his campaign to take the throne in Magadha and found the Maurya Empire. The Saka were the Scythians; the Yavanas were the Greeks, and the Parasikas were the Persians.

=== Yuezhi expansion (2nd century BCE)===
During the second century BCE, a nomadic movement began among the Central Asian tribes. Recorded in the annals of the Han dynasty and other Chinese records, the movement began after the Yuezhi tribe was defeated by the Xiongnu and fled west; this created a domino effect, displacing other central Asian tribes in their path.
According to these ancient sources, Modu Shanyu of the Xiongnu tribe of Mongolia attacked the Yuezhi (possibly related to the Tocharians, who lived in the eastern Tarim Basin) and evicted them from their homeland between the Qilian Shan and Dunhuang BCE. Leaving a few people behind, most of the population moved west to the Ili River region. They displaced the Saka, who migrated south into Ferghana and Sogdiana. According to the Chinese historical chronicles (who call the Saka &quot;Sai&quot; 塞): &quot;[The Yuezhi] attacked the king of the Sai, who moved a considerable distance to the south and the Yuezhi then occupied his lands.&quot;

Sometime after 155 BCE, the Yuezhi were again defeated by an alliance of the Wusun and the Xiongnu. They were forced to move south, again displacing the Scythians (who migrated south towards Bactria and present-day Afghanistan and south-west towards Parthia. A tribe known to ancient Greek scholars as the Sacaraucae (probably from the Old Persian &quot;Sakaravaka&quot;, &quot;nomadic Saka&quot;) and an allied people, the Massagetae, came into conflict with the Parthian Empire in Parthia between 138 and 124 BCE. The Sacaraucae-Massagetae alliance won several battles and killed the Parthian kings Phraates II and Artabanus I. The Yuezhi tribes migrated east into Bactria after their defeat, from which they conquered northern India to establish the Kushan Empire.

== Settlement in Sakastan ==

The Saka settled in Drangiana, a region of southern Afghanistan, western Pakistan and southern Iran which was then named Sakastan or Sistan. The mixed Scythian hordes who migrated to Drangiana and the surrounding regions later spread into north and south-west India via the lower Indus valley. They spread into Sovira, Gujarat, Rajasthan and north India, including kingdoms on the Indian mainland.

The Arsacid emperor Mithridates II (c. 123–88/87 BCE) pursued an aggressive military policy in Central Asia and added a number of provinces to the Parthian Empire. This included western Bactria, which he seized from the Indo-Scythians.

Following military pressure from the Yuezhi (predecessors of the Kushana), some Indo-Scythians moved from Bactria to Lake Helmond (or Hāmūn) and settled in or near Drangiana (Sigal). The region came to be known as &quot;Sakistana of the Skythian Sakai &quot; towards the end of the first century BCE.

The presence of the Saka in Sakastan in the first century BCE is mentioned by Isidore of Charax in &quot;The Parthian Stations&quot;. According to Isidore, they were bordered by Greek cities on the east (Alexandria of the Caucasus and Alexandria of the Arachosians) and the Parthian-controlled territory of Arachosia on the south:

Beyond is Sacastana of the Scythian Sacae, which is also Paraetacena, 63 schoeni. There are the city of Barda and the city of Min and the city of Palacenti and the city of Sigal; in that place is the royal residence of the Sacae; and nearby is the city of Alexandria (Alexandria Arachosia), and six villages.

== Kingdoms ==

=== Pamirs to Taxila ===
From petroglyphs left by Saka soldiers at river crossings in Chilas and on the Sacred Rock of Hunza in Pakistan, Ahmad Hassan Dani and have established the route across the Karakoram mountains used by Maues (the first Indo-Scythian king) to capture Taxila from Indo-Greek King Apollodotus II.

The first-century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea describes the Scythian territories:
Beyond this region (Gedrosia), the continent making a wide curve from the east across the depths of the bays, there follows the coast district of Scythia, which lies above toward the north; the whole marshy; from which flows down the river Sinthus, the greatest of all the rivers that flow into the Erythraean Sea, bringing down an enormous volume of water (...) This river has seven mouths, very shallow and marshy, so that they are not navigable, except the one in the middle; at which by the shore, is the market-town, Barbaricum. Before it there lies a small island, and inland behind it is the metropolis of Scythia, Minnagara; it is subject to Parthian princes who are constantly driving each other out ...

The Indo-Scythians established a kingdom in the northwest near Taxila, with two satraps: one at Mathura in the east, and the other at Surastrene (Gujarat) in the southwest.

=== Gandhara and Punjab ===

The presence of the Scythians in modern Pakistan and north-western India during the first century BCE was contemporaneous with the Indo-Greek kingdoms there, and they apparently initially recognized the power of the local Greek rulers. Maues first conquered Gandhara and Taxila in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan BCE, but his kingdom disintegrated after his death. In the east, the Indian king Vikrama retook Ujjain from the Indo-Scythians and celebrated his victory by establishing the Vikrama era in 58 BCE. Indo-Greek kings again ruled and prospered after Maues, as indicated by the profusion of coins from Kings Apollodotus II and Hippostratos. In 55 BCE, under Azes I, the Indo-Scythians took control of northwestern India with their victory over Hippostratos.

==== Sculpture ====


Excavations organized by John Marshall found several stone sculptures in the early Saka layer (layer number four, corresponding to the period of Azes I, in which a number of his coins were found). Several of them are toilet trays roughly imitative of finer Hellenistic examples found in earlier layers.

==== Bimaran casket ====

Azes is connected to the Bimaran casket, one of the earliest representations of the Buddha. The reliquary was used for the dedication of a stupa in Bamiran, near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, and placed inside the stupa with several coins of Azes. This may have happened during the reign of Azes (60–20 BCE), or slightly later. The Indo-Scythians were connected with Buddhism.

=== Mathura region ===


In northern India, the Indo-Scythians conquered the Mathura region BCE. Some of their satraps were Hagamasha and Hagana, who were followed by Rajuvula.

The Mathura lion capital, an Indo-Scythian sandstone capital which dates to the first century CE, describes in Kharoshthi script the gift of a stupa with a relic of the Buddha by Nadasi Kasa (Rajuvula&#x27;s queen). The capital also mentions the genealogy of several Indo-Scythian Mathura satraps. Rajuvula apparently eliminated Strato II (the last Indo-Greek king) CE and took Sagala, his capital city.

Coinage of the period, such as that of Rajuvula, tends to be crude. It is also debased; the silver content becomes lower and bronze content higher, an alloying technique suggesting a lack of wealth.

The Mathura lion capital inscriptions attest that Mathura came under Saka control. The inscriptions refer to Kharahostes and Queen Ayasia, the &quot;chief queen of the Indo-Scythian ruler of Mathura, satrap Rajuvula.&quot; Kharahostes was the son of Arta, as attested by his own coins. Arta was the brother of King Maues.

The Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura are sometimes called the Northern Satraps to distinguish them from the Western Satraps ruling in Gujarat and Malwa. After Rajuvula, several successors are known to have ruled as vassals of the Kushans. They include the &quot;Great Satrap&quot; Kharapallana and the satrap Vanaspara, who are known from an inscription discovered in Sarnath and dated to the third year of Kanishka (c. 130 CE), when they pledged allegiance to the Kushans.

=== Pataliputra ===

The &quot;Yuga Purana&quot; describes an invasion of Pataliputra by the Scythians during the first century BCE, after seven kings ruled in succession in Saketa following the retreat of the Yavanas. According to the &quot;Yuga Purana&quot;, the Saka king killed one-fourth of the population before he was slain by the Kalinga king Shata and a group of Sabalas.

=== Kushan and Indo-Parthian conquests ===
After Azes&#x27; death, Indo-Scythian rule in northwestern India ended with the rise of the Indo-Parthian ruler Gondophares late in the first century BCE. For the following decades, A number of minor Scythian leaders maintained themselves in local strongholds on the fringes of the loose Indo-Parthian empire over the next few decades, some paying allegiance to Gondophares I and his successors.

Indo-Parthian rule was gradually replaced with that of the Kushans, one of the five Yuezhi tribes who lived in Bactria for over a century and expanded into India during the late first century CE. The Kushans regained northwestern India CE and the Mathura region , where they prospered for several centuries.

=== Western Satraps ===

Indo-Scythians continued to hold the Sistan region until the reign of Bahram II (276–293 CE), and held several areas of India well into the first millennium; Kathiawar and Gujarat were under Western Satrap rule until the fifth century. Rudradaman I&#x27;s exploits are inscribed in the Junagadh rock inscription. During his campaigns, Rudradaman conqured the Yaudheyas and defeated the Satavahana Empire. The Western Satraps were conquered by the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II (also known as Vikramaditya).

== Coinage ==

Indo-Scythian coinage is generally of high quality, although the coins of Rajuvula deteriorate near the disintegration of Indo-Scythian rule CE. A fairly high-quality, stereotypical coinage was continued by the Western Satraps until the fourth century.

Indo-Scythian coinage is generally realistic, artistically between Indo-Greek and Kushan coinage. It has been suggested that its coinage benefited from the help of Greek coin-makers.
Indo-Scythian coins continue Indo-Greek tradition by using the Greek alphabet on the obverse and Kharoshthi script on the reverse. A portrait of the king is absent, with depictions of the king on a horse (sometimes on a camel) or sitting cross-legged on a cushion instead. The reverse of their coins typically show Greek gods.

Buddhist symbolism is present in Indo-Scythian coinage. The Indo-Scythians adopted the Indo-Greek practice (since Menander I) of depicting gods forming the vitarka mudra with their right hand (like Zeus on the coins of Maues or Azes II), the Buddhist lion on the coins of those two kings, or the triratana symbol on the coins of Zeionises.

== Art ==


Other than coins, few works of art are known to indisputably represent Indo-Scythians. Several Gandharan sculptures show foreigners in soft tunics, sometimes wearing the pointed hat typical of the Scythians. Kushan men seem to wear thick, rigid tunics, and are generally represented more simplistically.

=== Buner reliefs ===
Indo-Scythian soldiers in military attire are sometimes represented in Buddhist friezes in Gandharan art, particularly in the Buner reliefs. They are depicted in loose tunics with trousers, with heavy, straight swords. They wear pointed hoods or the Scythian cap; this distinguishes them from the Indo-Parthians, who wore a simple fillet over their bushy hair, and which is worn by Indo-Scythian rulers on their coins. With their right hand, some form the &quot;karana mudra&quot; to ward off evil spirits. In Gandhara, such friezes were used to decorate the pedestals of Buddhist stupas. They are contemporary with other friezes representing people in Greek attire, hinting at an intermixing of Indo-Scythians and Indo-Greeks. In another relief, the same type of soldiers are playing musical instruments and dancing; in Gandharan art, Indo-Scythians are typically depicted as reveling devotees.

=== Stone palettes ===
A number of stone palettes in Gandhara are considered representative of Indo-Scythian art. The palettes, which combine Greek and Iranian influences, often have a simple, archaic style. Stone palettes have only been found in archaeological layers corresponding to Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian rule, and are unknown in the preceding Mauryan layers or the succeeding Kushan layers.

The palettes often depict people in Greek dress in mythological scenes; a few have Parthian dress (headbands over bushy hair, crossed-over jacket on a bare chest, jewelry, belt, baggy trousers), and fewer have Indo-Scythian dress (Phrygian hat, tunic and straight trousers). A palette found in Sirkap, now in the New Delhi Museum, shows a winged Indo-Scythian horseman riding a winged deer and being attacked by a lion.

== Buddhism ==
The Indo-Scythians seem to have supported Buddhism, with many of their practices continuing those of the Indo-Greeks.They had an active role in the dissemination of Buddhism beyond India.

===Royal dedications===
Several Indo-Scythian kings after Azes made Buddhist dedications in their name on plaques or reliquaries: 
* Patika Kusulaka (25 BCE – 10 CE) related his donation of a relic of the Buddha Shakyamuni to a Buddhist monastery, in the Taxila copper plate. 
* Kharahostes (10 BCE – 10 CE) is mentioned on the Buddhist Mathura lion capital and on a reliquary. His coins were also found in the Bimaran casket, a gold reliquary with an early image of the Buddha now in the British Museum. Some of his coins have the Buddhist triratna symbol.
* Vijayamitra (ruled 12 BCE - 15 CE) dedicated a Buddhist reliquary. Some of his coins bear the Buddhist triratna symbol.
*Indravarman, while a prince in 5-6 CE, dedicated the Bajaur casket now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
*Zeionises and Aspavarma used the triratna on their coins. 
*Rajuvula erected the Mathura lion capital, which incorporates Buddhist symbols and relates the donations by his wife of relics to a stupa.

=== Butkara Stupa ===

Excavations at the Butkara Stupa in Swat by an Italian archaeological team have yielded Buddhist sculptures thought to belong to the Indo-Scythian period. An Indo-Corinthian capital of a Buddhist devotee in foliage has been found which had a reliquary and coins of Azes buried at its base, dating the sculpture to BCE. A contemporary pilaster of a Buddhist devotee in Greek dress has been found at the same spot, again suggesting a mingling of the populations. Reliefs at the same location show Indo-Scythians, with characteristic tunics and pointed hoods, with reliefs of standing Buddhas.

== In Indian literature ==
The Indo-Scythians were named &quot;Shaka&quot; in India, a variation of the name &quot;Saka&quot; used by the Persians for Scythians. Shakas are mentioned in the Purāṇas, the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;, the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, the &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot;, the &quot;Bṛhat Saṃhitā&quot; by Varāhamihira, the Kāvyamīmāṃsā, the Bṛhatkathāmañjarīi, and the &quot;Kathāsaritsāgara&quot;. They are described as part of a group of other warlike tribes from the northwest.

There are references to the warring &quot;mleccha&quot; hordes of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas and Pahlavas in the &quot;Balakanda&quot; of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. H. C. Raychadhury saw in these verses the struggles between the Hindus and the invading hordes of &quot;mleccha&quot; barbarians from the northwest beginning in the second century BCE, and fixed the date of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; around (or after) the 2nd century CE.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; also alludes to the invasion of mixed hordes from the northwest, with prophetic verses that &quot;...the Mlechha (barbaric) kings of the Shakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Bahlikas ... shall rule the earth un-righteously in &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; ...&quot;

== Sai-Wang hordes ==

A portion of Central Asian Scythians under Sai-Wang reportedly moved south, crossed the Pamir Mountains and entered Chipin (or Kipin) after crossing the Xuandu (懸度, Hanging Pass) above the valley of Kanda in Swat. Chipin has been identified by Pelliot, Bagchi, Raychaudhury and others as Kashmir, but other scholars identify it as Kafiristan. Sai-Wang established his kingdom in Kipin. Konow interprets the Sai-Wang as the Śaka Murunda of Indian literature; &quot;murunda&quot; is synonymous with &quot;wang&quot; (king, master or lord). Bagchi interprets &quot;Wang&quot; as the king of the Scythians, but distinguishes the Sai Sakas from the Murunda Sakas. The Sai Scythians may have been Kamboja Scythians; the Sai-Wang were part of the Parama Kamboja kingdom of Transoxiana, and returned after being evicted from their ancestral land. Maues might have belonged to this group of Scythians who migrated from the Sai country (Central Asia) to Chipin.

== Evidence of joint invasions ==
The Scythian groups who invaded India and established kingdoms included, in addition to the Saka, allied tribes such as the Medii, Xanthii, and Massagetae. These peoples were absorbed into mainstream Indian society.

The Shakas were from the trans-Hemodos region—the &quot;Shakadvipa&quot; of the Puranas or the Scythia of classical writings. At the beginning of the first century CE, Isidore of Charax notes their presence in Sistan. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (c. 70–80 CE) documents a Scythian district in the lower Indus Valley, with Minnagra its capital. Ptolemy (c. 140 CE) also documents an Indo-Scythia in south-western India which consisted of the Patalene and Surastrene (Saurashtra) territories. The second-century BCE Scythian invasion of India was probably carried out jointly by the Saka, Pahlavas, Kambojas, Paradas, Rishikas and other allied tribes from the northwest.

== Dynasties and rulers ==
== Descendants ==

Tadeusz Sulimirski notes that the Saka also invaded parts of northern India. Indian linguist Weer Rajendra Rishi has identified linguistic affinities between Indian and Central Asian languages, which also suggests a Saka influence in northern India.

<doc id="839410" wikidata="Q882665" url="?curid=839410" title="Roy Barnes">
<text>Roy Eugene Barnes (born March 11, 1948) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 80th governor of Georgia from 1999 to 2003. As of 2025, he is the most recent Democrat to serve as governor of Georgia.

A Democratic member of the Georgia Senate from 1974 to 1990, Barnes ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990, losing to Lieutenant Governor Zell Miller in the Democratic primary. Barnes then served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1992 to 1998. He ran for governor again in 1998, handily winning the primary and general elections.

In 2003, Barnes was awarded the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library for his success while governor of minimizing the Confederate battle emblem on the Georgia state flag despite the political fallout. It is widely believed that his support of the flag change significantly contributed to his re-election defeat in 2002.

After his defeat, he resumed the practice of law and co-chaired the Aspen Institute Commission on No Child Left Behind Act. He returned to politics when he ran for governor again in 2010, losing to Republican Nathan Deal. A decade later, he declined the invitation to act as special counsel in the Georgia election racketeering and fraud case involving former president Donald Trump, and stated, &quot;I told DA Willis that I lived with bodyguards for four years and I didn’t like it, and I wasn’t going to live with bodyguards for the rest of my life.&quot;

== Early life, education, and family ==
Roy Barnes was born on March 11, 1948, in Mableton, Georgia. His family owned a general store, which gave him his first exposure to politics as he listened to the conversations of the store patrons.

Upon his graduation from South Cobb High School, Barnes enrolled at the University of Georgia. He was active on the debate team; and spent his summers returning home to work in the family store. He graduated with a degree in history in 1969; and one year later married Marie Dobbs of Marietta, Georgia, with whom he has had three children.

After college, Barnes enrolled in the University of Georgia School of Law. While there, he was elected president of the student bar association, and was named outstanding senior. He graduated from law school in 1972 with honors, and returned to Cobb County to work as a prosecutor in the Cobb County District Attorney&#x27;s Office after serving four months in the Army.

==Georgia General Assembly==
===Georgia Senate===
Barnes’ political career began in 1974, when he was elected by the citizens of Mableton to the Georgia State Senate. Upon his election, Barnes became the youngest member of the Georgia Senate at age 26. Barnes went on to serve eight terms in the Georgia Senate.

After his second term, he was named floor leader to Governor Joe Frank Harris, and was appointed chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his tenure in the Georgia Senate, he also served on the Senate Appropriations, Rules, and Transportation committees, and had a major leadership role in rewriting the Georgia constitution as chair of the Select Committee on Constitutional Revision.

===1990 gubernatorial election===
After eight terms in the Georgia Senate, Barnes entered the 1990 gubernatorial election. He faced Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Lt. Governor Zell Miller in the Democratic Primary. Barnes was defeated by Miller, who later won the election and became an ally of Barnes.

===Georgia House of Representatives===
Barnes returned to politics in 1992, when he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. He was appointed vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, and chair of the Subcommittee on General Law. During his tenure in the Georgia House, he also served on the Rules and Banks, and Banking Committees.

Barnes was a founding board member of Georgia State Bank located in Mableton, Georgia. He served on the bank&#x27;s board of directors from 1986 until 1997 when he resigned to run for governor. In addition to Georgia State Bank, Barnes has been involved with other community banks in Georgia.

==Governor of Georgia==
===1998 gubernatorial election===
In 1998, Barnes ran for governor again, this time defeating Secretary of State Lewis A. Massey to win the Democratic primary. Running on the themes of education reform and health care reform, he defeated Republican businessman Guy Millner in the general election with a victory of 52% to 44% to become the 80th Governor of Georgia.

The Democrats retained control of both houses of the legislature and retained all but two state level offices (Republicans were elected Insurance Commissioner and School Superintendent).

===Tenure===

In January 1999 after being elected governor, Barnes’ first act of his new administration was to sign an order banning all lobbyist gifts to the 56,000 employees working in the state government&#x27;s executive branch.

Barnes also took executive action to change the flag of the state of Georgia, despite vocal opposition. The state flag had featured the Confederate battle emblem since 1956.

Barnes&#x27; education reform measures included eliminating tenure for newly hired teachers and ending social promotion by requiring students to pass a test before advancing to the next grade. Teachers did not support his proposals for ending tenure and other protections for new teachers, but Georgia&#x27;s Department of Education supported his calls for ending social promotion.

Georgia&#x27;s Child Advocate Office within Georgia&#x27;s Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) was established by Barnes as a result of the death of five-year-old Terrell Peterson, whose care was under state supervision at the time of his death. Barnes signed the Terrell Peterson Act to protect children at risk of death due to abuse, also as a result of Peterson&#x27;s death.

Barnes proposed highway safety measures to curb teen driving in an attempt to save lives of young drivers who are killed in automobile crashes. Barnes proposed a curfew for teens at 10 p.m., a limit on passengers riding in their vehicles, and a ban on 16-year-olds driving without adult supervision in 18 metropolitan Atlanta counties.

Further, Barnes supported the building of the Northern Arc, an outer perimeter north of Atlanta, which met with opposition from locals.

During most of his tenure, State Senator Charles B. Tanksley, served as his floor manager in the Georgia Senate.

===2002 gubernatorial election===
Facing re-election, Barnes lost in an upset in November 2002 as part of a larger Republican midterm sweep. Although some commentators have pointed to the ire of voters opposing the flag change and him upsetting teachers as leading to his defeat, the cause was finally attributed toward a strong shift to GOP within that election cycle across many offices in the State of Georgia, at that time. Barnes was defeated by Sonny Perdue, the first Republican to be elected Governor of Georgia since Reconstruction.

According to the February 2004 issue of &quot;Georgia Trend&quot;, &quot;Democrat Roy Barnes was one of the most powerful governors in history. His nickname &#x27;King Roy&#x27; was an affectionate term accorded him by supporters because he knew how to pull the levers and make things happen in the legislature.&quot; Barnes was also known as a powerful &#x27;suburban governor.&#x27;

==Return to legal career==

Following his defeat, Barnes decided to lend his talents to a legal aid organization, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Inc., working for six months as a full-time volunteer. During this time, he provided legal advice to indigent clients pro bono, and established a website outlining the rights of consumers: www.myconsumerrights.com.

===Profile in Courage Award===
For his leadership in minimizing the Confederate battle emblem on the Georgia state flag despite the political fallout, Barnes was awarded the 2003 Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library.

===Barnes Law Group===
Upon completing his service at Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Barnes founded the Barnes Law Group with his daughter, Allison Barnes Salter; son-in-law, John Salter; and long-time law partner, Charles Tanksley. The Barnes Law Group continues Barnes&#x27; private law practice which began in 1975 when he formed his first law firm.

====Georgia Supreme Court rulings as attorney====

The Georgia Supreme Court, on June 11, 2007, unanimously dismissed a legal challenge to the state&#x27;s voter ID law. Barnes argued before the court that the voter identification law was unconstitutional because Plaintiff Rosalind Lake - a first-time voter after having moved to Georgia - did not have a driver&#x27;s license, and was therefore excluded in a discriminatory manner.

The state&#x27;s highest court, however, stated that Lake, the only plaintiff in the case, had photograph identification through MARTA, the area&#x27;s mass transit system, as a result of needed disability access to it, that would have qualified her to vote in July 2006, so she did not have legal standing to file suit. Justice Harold Melton wrote that since Lake had photograph identification that was acceptable for voting, in-person, under the 2006 Act, she did not have standing to challenge the state&#x27;s voter identification law as an unconstitutional restriction on her voting rights.

Previously, Georgians could show one of 17 forms of identification, including those without photos, such as utility bills, to check in at the polls. Supporters said it would increase voter confidence through a better verification process. Legislators revised the law and made it easier for people to get free photo cards for voting, but the rules were repeatedly barred from implementation until early 2008.

==Aspen Institute Commission on No Child Left Behind==

On February 14, 2006, the Aspen Institute announced the forming of the Commission on No Child Left Behind. Barnes, along with former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, was named co-chair of the commission.

According to its mission, the commission &quot;is a bipartisan effort to identify and build support for improvements in federal education policy to spur academic achievement and close persistent achievement gaps.&quot;

==2010 gubernatorial election==

Barnes announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Georgia in the 2010 election on June 3, 2009 in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia.

Barnes’ campaign, Roy 2010, emphasized growing jobs, securing water sources, improving education, and expanding transportation options.
Barnes won the 2010 Democratic Primary on July 20, 2010, and faced off against Republican Nathan Deal and Libertarian John Monds.

On November 2, 2010, Barnes conceded to Deal as the Republican rode a wave of GOP backing in the 2010 midterm elections.

<doc id="839427" wikidata="Q4791440" url="?curid=839427" title="Arizona State University West campus">
<text>Arizona State University at the West Valley campus is a public university in Phoenix, Arizona. It is one of five university campuses that compose Arizona State University (ASU). The West Valley campus was established by the Arizona Legislature in 1984, and is located in northwest Phoenix, bordering the city of Glendale.

For many purposes, ASU&#x27;s campuses are unified as a single institution so the West Valley campus shares students, faculty, administration, and accreditation with the other campuses. As of Fall 2009, 10,380 students were enrolled in at least one course on the West Valley campus, while the FTE enrollment for the campus is 6,173. Since Fall 2018, on campus enrollment has been about 5,000 on ground students every year.

In 2008, the West Valley campus was designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride, and in 2011, construction concluded on a large solar array that powers nearly the entire campus with solar power.

==History==

Arizona state legislator, Anne Lindeman, located three hundred acres of state land that the West Valley campus currently occupies in 1982. She also drafted the 1984 legislation that created the ASU West Valley campus. Lindeman also created the legislation for the lease-purchase agreement that allowed for $48 million for additional campus construction in 1988.

Established as the second ASU campus in 1984, construction of the West Valley Campus began in February 1986. Prior to the opening of the campus, some classes were held at five other locations in the area including Metrocenter Mall. The Fletcher Library was the first building completed, dedicated in 1988 to honor Robert L. Fletcher and his family, whose gift of property resulted in an endowment for the perpetual support of the library. More buildings were completed like the Sands Classroom Building and the Administration Offices Building, the following year, in 1989. The second main classroom building, Classroom/Lab/Computer Classroom Building, was constructed in 2 phases, with Phase 1 opening in Spring 1991 and Phase 2 opening Spring 2002.

Originally known as &quot;ASU West,&quot; this campus operated quasi-independently of the Tempe campus and had its own administration, faculty, and student admissions process. At the time, the West Valley campus was designed to offer only upper-level undergraduate courses (with lower-level courses to be taken at nearby Glendale Community College). In 2001, freshmen students were admitted, allowing them to complete their entire undergraduate education on the West Valley campus. The academic offerings on the West Valley campus were designed to highlight an interdisciplinary focus in the liberal arts and sciences, education, and business. With the arrival of current ASU president Michael Crow in 2002, the academic structure of ASU was reorganized to integrate the West Valley campus into the university as a whole. Today, the West Valley campus shares faculty, students, accreditation, and administration with the other ASU campuses.

In March 2023, the university announced it would be expanding its West Valley campus adding two new buildings in order to add more programs to the campus, among these was a second residence hall. It also announced that it would begin more classes in business, forensics, and engineering starting that fall semester. The University hopes that with this new expansion is can add roughly ten thousand new students to its West Valley campus, helping those in the West Valley, more easily access ASU programs.

==Academics and Programs ==
The programs offered on the West Valley campus focus on interdisciplinary and collaborative programs in the liberal arts and sciences, education, and business, leading to bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees. The West Valley campus is the headquarters of ASU&#x27;s New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences and Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, and offers additional programs from the W. P. Carey School of Business. ASU&#x27;s Graduate College, Honors College and University College also have an administrative presence on the campus.

In 2015, the Thunderbird School of Global Management, which had recently become part of ASU, began offering an undergraduate program at ASU&#x27;s West Valley campus.; (See also and .) Thunderbird&#x27;s headquarters and its graduate programs, previously based in Glendale, Arizona, are now located at and integrated into ASU’s downtown Phoenix campus, while the undergraduate programs remain in the West Valley.

In 2023, the West Valley Forward campaign announced the development of three new schools that will be housed in the new academic building being built. This is bringing Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering to the West Valley campus.

==Facilities==

The West Valley campus is the smallest of ASU&#x27;s campuses in terms of facility space (square footage of buildings). The campus primarily consists of five academic buildings arranged around a quad, with a secondary quad surrounded by the campus&#x27;s dormitories, dining hall, and recreation center.

In 2011, the Gary K. Herberger Young Scholars Academy, a private school for gifted children, opened on the east side of the campus. In August 2017 the school moved into a new 19,500 sq foot building near the secondary quad. The school currently uses the Cambridge Learning Curriculum and a move on when ready program. The six levels range from Middle Years 1 to A-Level years. The two levels of Middle Years houses students from 10 to 14 years old. The IGSCE year houses students from 12 to 15 years old. A-Level years usually host students 15–18 years old. The Herberger Young Scholars Academy shares facilities with the rest of the ASU West Valley campus.

=== Academic Buildings ===
There are two main classroom buildings on the West Valley Campus: Sands and Classroom/Lab/Computer Classroom (CLCC). These buildings house a majority of the classrooms on campus. Sands is mainly standard lecture rooms with the average capacity of about 36 students. CLCC has standard classrooms with a wide range of capacities, but is mostly home to the laboratories of the West Valley campus. CLCC houses all of the teaching laboratory classrooms as well as the research laboratories of New College faculty, namely the wet lab laboratories of the School of Mathematical and Natural Science faculty and the School of Interdisciplinary Forensics faculty.

ASU West Valley has a single standard lecture hall, Lecture Hall 110, with a capacity for 150 students. It is the largest classroom on campus.

A new academic building is being constructed as part of the West Valley Forward Campaign launched in March 2023. Construction started in Fall of 2023, and the building is expected to be finished Spring 2025. The new building will house additional classrooms, computer classrooms, faculty offices, research labs, and additional growth space as more programs move to West Valley campus.

=== Residence Halls ===
Two residential complexes are located on the West Valley campus: Casa De Oro, a LEED Silver complex built in 2012, offers traditional dormitory-style accommodations in which students are arranged based on their academic area of study. Las Casas, built in 2002, offers apartment-style units for upper-division and graduate students.

A new residential building named Casa Del Valle is also being constructed as part of the West Valley Forward Campaign. Construction started in Fall of 2023, and the building is expected to be open Fall 2024. The new residential hall will bring an additional 500 beds to West to house on campus students.

<text>Wangfujing Street () is a shopping street in Beijing, China, located in Dongcheng District. The majority of the main area is pedestrianised. Since the middle of the Ming Dynasty there have been commercial activities in the area. In the Qing Dynasty, ten aristocratic estates and princess residence were built here, soon after when a well full of sweet water was discovered, thereby giving the street its name &quot;Wangfu&quot; (Prince&#x27;s residence), &quot;Jing&quot; (Well). Many exotic foods are served on Wangfujing snack street.

==Location==
Wangfujing Street starts from Wangfujing South Entrance (王府井南口, Wángfǔjǐng Nánkǒu), where the Oriental Plaza, Beijing Hotel, and the Wangfujing metro station are located. The street then heads north, passing the Wangfujing Bookstore, the Beijing Department Store as well as the Beijing Foreign Languages Bookstore before ending at the Beijing apm and St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church.

==History==
The street was also previously known as Morrison Street in English, after the Australian journalist George Ernest Morrison. Wangfujing is also one of the traditional downtown areas of Beijing, along with Liulichang.

Until the late 1990s, the street was open to traffic. Modifications in 1999 and 2000 made much of Wangfujing Street pedestrian only (aside from the tour trolley). Now through traffic detours to the east of the street.

The 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests were planned to take place in Wangfujing. Some violence occurred there between police and foreign journalists.

==Stores==
Wangfujing is now home to around 280 shops. Wangfujing malls include the Beijing Department Store, Beijing apm, Beijing Mall and The Malls at Oriental Plaza, and WF Central.

==Food and snacks==
Wangfujing snack street, located in hutongs just west of the main street, contains many restaurants and street food stalls. The food stalls serve a variety of common and exotic street food, including chuanr (meat kebabs, commonly made of lamb) and desserts, such as tanghulu or candied fruits on a stick.

== Transport ==
The Wangfujing station of Beijing Subway Lines 1 and 8, is located at the intersection of Wangfujing Street and Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

<doc id="839440" wikidata="Q120712" url="?curid=839440" title="Slanted and Enchanted">
<text>Slanted and Enchanted is the debut studio album by American indie rock band Pavement, released on April 20, 1992 by Matador Records. It is the only Pavement album to feature drummer Gary Young.

The album received critical acclaim and is seen as a landmark for indie rock, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranking it 199th on its 2020 edition of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. As of 2007, the album had sold 150,000 copies. In 2022, Alex Ross Perry adapted the album into a rock opera titled &quot;Slanted! Enchanted!&quot;

== Background ==
&quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; was distributed to critics as early as 1991, months before its official release; the original distribution did not feature the entire band, as several members joined during its production. The recording sessions were split between South Makepeace Studios in Brooklyn, New York (recorded December 24, 1990) and Louder Than You Think Studios in Stockton, California (recorded January 13–20, 1991).

==Release==

===Singles===
The album’s first single, &quot;Summer Babe&quot;, appeared in August 1991. It was Pavement’s last release of new material for the Chicago-based Drag City label before the band moved to Matador Records. The single contained the B-sides &quot;Mercy Snack (The Laundromat)&quot; and &quot;Baptist Blacktick&quot; that were included on Japanese versions in the CD, and later on the deluxe version of the album. A different mix of &quot;Summer Babe,&quot; entitled &quot;Summer Babe (Winter Version),&quot; became the first track on the album. The song would go on to be ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as number 286 in its 2004 list of the 500 greatest songs of all time, and as number 292 in the 2011 update of the list.

The album’s second single, &quot;Trigger Cut&quot;, was first released in the UK by Big Cat Records on July 13, 1992, before appearing in the US market through Matador the following month.

===Album===
&quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; was officially released on April 20, 1992, to critical acclaim, originally reaching a peak of number 72 on the UK Albums Chart. As of 2007, the album had sold 150,000 copies.

== Packaging ==
The title &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; is taken from the title of a cartoon made by Silver Jews frontman David Berman. Its cover art was created by appropriating that of an existing album, Ferrante &amp; Teicher&#x27;s &quot;Keyboard Kapers&quot;.

== Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe ==
In 2002, Matador released &quot;Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe&quot;, a compilation containing &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; in its entirety, as well outtakes and other rarities from the same era.
Matador Records released &quot;Luxe &amp; Reduxe&quot; on October 20, 2002, alongside the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD. It features 48 songs, including the entire original disc and, in addition, 3 outtakes of which one is an unreleased song and the other two are alternate takes, plus the B-sides from the &quot;Summer Babe&quot; and &quot;Trigger Cut&quot; singles, 5 songs from two different John Peel sessions, the 4-track EP &quot;Watery, Domestic&quot;, and 13 tracks of a live performance of the band held at the Brixton Academy in London on December 14, 1992.

&quot;Luxe &amp; Reduxe&quot; reached number 5 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Independent Albums and number 152 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts.

==Critical reception==
Slanted and Enchanted received critical acclaim. In a contemporary review of the album, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was highly positive, writing that Pavement are &quot;always good at both tune and noise&quot; and that the music on &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; yields &quot;a message complex enough to offer hope ... that the lyrics will catch up&quot;. Erik Davis of &quot;Spin&quot; designated &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; as the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Platter du Jour&quot; for March 1992, describing the album as &quot;so fine it occasionally seems too perfect.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Since its release &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; has appeared on many critics&#x27; best-of lists and is frequently cited as being among the most influential indie rock albums of the 1990s. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited the album as &quot;a left-field classic&quot; and &quot;one of the most influential records of the &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded the album their maximum grade of 10.0/10.0 in a review of the album&#x27;s reissue and ranked it as the fifth greatest album of the 1990s in 2003. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; &quot;the quintessential indie rock album&quot; and placed it on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;slacker masterpiece&quot; and &quot;the definitive indie rock album&quot;.

<doc id="839446" wikidata="Q5327566" url="?curid=839446" title="East-West Airlines (India)">
<text>In 1990-91 the entry of private airlines began, after the de-regulation of the Indian Civil Aviation sector. Private airlines were given permission to operate charter and non-scheduled services under the ‘Air Taxi’ Scheme. East West Airlines, head-quartered in Trivandrum was the first national level private airline in India to operate after almost 37 years.

==History==
East West Airlines was promoted by Thakiyudeen Abdul Wahid, a native from Varkala Trivandrum district. The airline began operations in early 1992 when the Indian Government reformed the industry by its &quot;open skies policy&quot; that gave rise to numerous private air charter operators that serviced India. The airline established offices in Trivandrum in 1995, New Delhi, Madras (now named Chennai) and Mumbai.

It started, as per government stipulations, with three aircraft, all Boeing 737-200s. In 1992, to counter the impact of a crippling Indian Airlines pilot strike, the then-Civil Aviation minister, Madhavrao Scindia asked the airline to bring in more aircraft. East West went on to acquire four more, taking its count to seven Boeing 737s.

The Indian Government granted scheduled domestic airline status to nine private air charter operators, including East West, in 1994.

On 13 November 1995 the company&#x27;s managing director Thakiyudeen Wahid was shot dead near his Mumbai office. The airline owed 3.3 million dollars to PLM Equipment - an American company from which it had leased three Boeings. PLM Equipment first appealed to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to deregister the aircraft and then went to court. The Delhi high court ordered East West to pay up or return the aircraft. The three aircraft were then grounded.

In May 1996 the airline sought and was given DGCA permission to stop flying trunk routes due to a shortage of aircraft. By June 1996 it had decided to fly only from Mumbai to non-trunk destinations such as Calicut, Trivandrum and Cochin.
Finally, on 8 August 1996, East West Airlines ceased all operations.

==Destinations==
*South Asia
*Trivandrum (Trivandrum International Airport)
*Ahmedabad (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport)
*Kolkata (Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport) 
*Mumbai (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport)
*Bangalore (Bangalore Airport)
*Belgaum (Belgaum Airport)
*Mangalore (Mangalore Airport)
*New Delhi (New Delhi Airport)
*Goa (Goa Airport)
*Chennai (Chennai Airport)
*Madurai (Madurai Airport)
*Visakhapatnam

==Fleet==
East West operated a total fleet of eleven aircraft, comprising eight leased Boeing 737-200s and three Fokker F27s. After the airline shut down operations, the Boeings were returned to their lessors; while two Fokkers were stored at Mumbai Airport until 2006, when they were auctioned off by AAI to recover some of the fees it was owed by way of parking and landing charges.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 1 July 1995, an East West Airlines Fokker F27, registered VT-EWE, was engaged in a touch-and-go landing training exercise at Vadodara Airport when the aircraft&#x27;s left main landing gear failed on touchdown. The aircraft continued moving forward on its belly and skid to a halt on the runway. There was no fire and no injury to persons on board the aircraft.
Poor maintenance was cited as a contributory factor in the accident. The aircraft was written off.

That very year, the owner of East-West airlines was murdered by thugs as he left work for home.

<doc id="839463" wikidata="Q2532820" url="?curid=839463" title="Rudbeckia hirta">
<text>Rudbeckia hirta, commonly called black-eyed Susan, is a North American flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to Eastern and Central North America and naturalized in the Western part of the continent as well as in China. It has now been found in all 10 Canadian Provinces and all 48 of the states in the contiguous United States. 

&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; is the state flower of Maryland.

==Description==
&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; is an upright annual (sometimes biennial or perennial) growing tall by wide. It has alternate, mostly basal leaves 10–18 cm long, covered by coarse hair, with stout branching stems and daisy-like, composite flower heads appearing in late summer and early autumn. In the species, the flowers are up to in diameter, with yellow ray florets circling conspicuous brown or black, dome-shaped cone of many small disc florets. However, extensive breeding has produced a range of sizes and colours, including oranges, reds and browns.

==Etymology and common names==
The specific epithet &quot;hirta&quot; is Latin for &quot;hairy&quot;, and refers to the trichomes occurring on leaves and stems. Other common names for this plant include: brown-eyed Susan, brown betty, gloriosa daisy, golden Jerusalem, English bull&#x27;s eye, poor-land daisy, yellow daisy, and yellow ox-eye daisy.

==Varieties==
There are four varieties
*&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; var. &quot;angustifolia&quot; – southeastern + south-central United States (South Carolina to Texas)
*&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; var. &quot;floridana&quot; – Florida
*&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; var. &quot;hirta&quot; – Eastern United States (Maine to Alabama).
*&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; var. &quot;pulcherrima&quot; – Widespread in most of North America (Newfoundland to British Columbia, south to Alabama and New Mexico; naturalized Washington to California).

==Cultivation==
&quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; is widely cultivated in parks and gardens, for summer bedding schemes, borders, containers, wildflower gardens, prairie-style plantings and cut flowers. Numerous cultivars have been developed, of which &#x27;Indian Summer&#x27; and &#x27;Toto&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. Other popular cultivars include &#x27;Double Gold&#x27; and &#x27;Marmalade&#x27;.

Gloriosa daisies are tetraploid cultivars having much larger flower heads than the wild species, often doubled or with contrasting markings on the ray florets. They were first bred by Alfred Blakeslee of Smith College by applying colchicine to &quot;R. hirta&quot; seeds; Blakeslee&#x27;s stock was further developed by W. Atlee Burpee and introduced to commerce at the 1957 Philadelphia Flower Show. Gloriosa daisies are generally treated as annuals or short-lived perennials and are typically grown from seed, though there are some named cultivars.

==Symbolism and uses==

===Maryland state flower===

The black-eyed Susan was designated as the state flower of Maryland in 1918. In this capacity it is used in gardens and ceremonies to celebrate, memorialize and show affection for the state of Maryland and its people. The Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, Maryland, has been termed &quot;The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans&quot; because a blanket of Viking Poms, a variety of chrysanthemums resembling black-eyed Susans, is traditionally placed around the winning horse&#x27;s neck (actual black-eyed Susans are not in bloom in May during the Preakness).

===University of Southern Mississippi===
In 1912, the black-eyed Susan became the inspiration for the University of Southern Mississippi school colors (black and gold), suggested by Florence Burrow Pope, a member of the university&#x27;s first graduating class. According to Pope: &quot;On a trip home, I saw great masses of Black-Eyed Susans in the pine forests. I decided to encourage my senior class to gather Black-Eyed Susans to spell out the name of the class on sheets to be displayed during exercises on Class Day. I then suggested black and gold as class colors, and my suggestion was adopted.&quot;

===Butterfly attractant for enhancing gardens===
Butterflies are attracted to &quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot;. It is a larval host to the bordered patch, gorgone checkerspot, and silvery checkerspot species.

===Mosquito control by dragonflies===
Dragonflies, voracious eaters of mosquitoes, are attracted by the tiny pollinators of these flowers.

===Traditional Native American uses===
The plant is thought to be an herbal medicine by Native American for various ailments. The roots, though not the seedheads, of &quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot; can be used much like the related &quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot; with unsubstantiated claims to boost immunity and fight colds, flu and infections. The Ojibwa people used it as a poultice for snake bites and to make an infusion for treating colds and worms in children.

===Cautions===
The species is toxic to cats when ingested.

<text>The [[Athens Metro]] is a rapid transit system serving the Athens urban area and parts of East Attica. As of 10 October 2022, there are 66 stations on three different lines. 62 of the 66 stations are owned and operated by Urban Rail Transport S.A. (STASY): three stations (, and ) are owned by the Hellenic Railways Organisation and operated by Hellenic Train, while the station is owned and operated by the airport authority that owns and manages Athens International Airport.

The opening of the second phase of the Line 3 extension towards Piraeus, in October 2022, added two new stations to the network ( and ), bringing the total to 66.

==Overview==

All Athens Metro trains and stations are accessible for wheelchair users. However, Transport for Athens (OASA) advises wheelchair users of Line 1 to travel in the leading car, and to ask staff to deploy a portable boarding ramp (located on the platforms) at , and , because the curved platforms at these stations leave a significant gap between the train and the platform.

==Stations==

Listed for each of the 66 stations are the lines serving it, the local authority in which it is located, and the date when it opened. The spelling of the station names on this table, in English and Greek, are according to the signage. Interchange stations are counted once: they are currently five of them, at and (Lines 1 and 2), and (Lines 1 and 3), and (Lines 2 and 3).

=== Station layouts ===

Most Athens Metro stations have two tracks and two side platforms. The following stations have a different layout:

===Park and ride facilities===

There are six park and ride facilities: four are managed by STASY, and two by Elliniko Metro.

The 240-space car park for , operated by Elliniko Metro, was closed due to the construction of Line 4.

==Future stations==

Construction of the first stage of Line 4 began on 22 June 2021, with a target completion date of 2030. The project will create fourteen new stations and make Evangelismos an interchange station with Line 3. Akadimia will be a standalone station, but there will be a direct tunnel connection with Line 2 at , under Patriarch Gregory V Street. All the stations will be underground. Except for Evangelismos, the spelling of the station names on this table, in English and Greek, are according to Elliniko Metro (the infrastructure manager of the Athens Metro).

<doc id="839471" wikidata="Q7672544" url="?curid=839471" title="TWINKLE">
<text>TWINKLE (The [[Weizmann Institute of Science|Weizmann Institute]] Key Locating Engine) is a hypothetical integer factorization device described in 1999 by Adi Shamir and purported to be capable of factoring 512-bit integers. It is also a pun on the twinkling LEDs used in the device. Shamir estimated that the cost of TWINKLE could be as low as $5000 per unit with bulk production. TWINKLE has a successor named TWIRL which is more efficient.

==Method==
The goal of TWINKLE is to implement the sieving step of the Number Field Sieve algorithm, which is the fastest known algorithm for factoring large integers. The sieving step, at least for 512-bit and larger integers, is the most time consuming step of NFS. It involves testing a large set of numbers for B-&#x27;smoothness&#x27;, i.e., absence of a prime factor greater than a specified bound B.

What is remarkable about TWINKLE is that it is not a purely digital device. It gets its efficiency by eschewing binary arithmetic for an &quot;optical&quot; adder which can add hundreds of thousands of quantities in a single clock cycle.

The key idea used is &quot;time-space inversion&quot;. Conventional NFS sieving is carried out one prime at a time. For each prime, all the numbers to be tested for smoothness in the range under consideration which are divisible by that prime have their counter incremented by the logarithm of the prime (similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes). TWINKLE, on the other hand, works one candidate smooth number (call it X) at a time. There is one LED corresponding to each prime smaller than B. At the time instant corresponding to X, the set of LEDs glowing corresponds to the set of primes that divide X. This can be accomplished by having the LED associated with the prime &quot;p&quot; glow once every &quot;p&quot; time instants. Further, the intensity of each LED is proportional to the logarithm of the corresponding prime. Thus, the total intensity equals the sum of the logarithms of all the prime factors of X smaller than B. This intensity is equal to the logarithm of X if and only if X is B-smooth.

Even in PC-based implementations, it&#x27;s a common optimization to speed up sieving by adding approximate logarithms of small primes together. Similarly, TWINKLE has much room for error in its light measurements; as long as the intensity is at about the right level, the number is very likely to be smooth enough for the purposes of known factoring algorithms. The existence of even one large factor would imply that the logarithm of a large number is missing, resulting in a very low intensity; because most numbers have this property, the device&#x27;s output would tend to consist of stretches of low intensity output with brief bursts of high intensity output.

In the above it is assumed that X is square-free, i.e. it is not divisible by the square of any prime. This is acceptable since the factoring algorithms only require &quot;sufficiently many&quot; smooth numbers, and the &quot;yield&quot; decreases only by a small constant factor due to the square-freeness assumption. There is also the problem of false positives due to the inaccuracy of the optoelectronic hardware, but this is easily solved by adding a PC-based post-processing step for verifying the smoothness of the numbers identified by TWINKLE.

<doc id="839472" wikidata="Q5977491" url="?curid=839472" title="Interleaved 2 of 5">
<text>Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF) is a continuous two-width barcode symbology encoding digits. It is used commercially on 135 film, for ITF-14 barcodes, and on cartons of some products, while the products inside are labeled with UPC or EAN. ITF was created by David Allais, who also invented barcodes Code 39, Code 11, Code 93, and Code 49.

==Encoding scheme==
ITF encodes pairs of digits; the first digit is encoded in the five bars (or black lines), while the second digit is encoded in the five spaces (or white lines) interleaved with them. Two out of every five bars or spaces are wide, giving the name &quot;2 of 5&quot;, and each pair has a consistent width. The wide lines form a two-out-of-five code with consecutive values of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 0, where the code 0 is assigned to the value of 11. This is similar to the POSTNET bar code.
The digits are encoded to symbols as follows:

where &quot;n&quot; is a narrow line (bar or space) and &quot;W&quot; a wide line (2.0 to 3.0 times the width of a narrow line).
Because digits are encoded by pairs, only an even number of digits can be encoded. Typically an odd number of digits is encoded by adding a &quot;0&quot; as first digit, but sometimes an odd number of digits is encoded by using five narrow spaces in the last digit.

A checksum can be added as last digit, which is calculated in the same way as UPC checksums.

===Start / stop and formatting===
Before the actual pairs there is a start code consisting of nnnn (narrow bar – narrow space – narrow bar – narrow space), and after all symbols there is the stop code consisting of Wnn (Wide bar – narrow space – narrow bar).

There are specific constraints on the height and width of the bars and the width of the &quot;quiet zones&quot;, the blank areas before the start and after the stop symbol; some of the standards that provide requirements for ITF (specifically ITF-14) include ISO/IEC 16390 and GS1 General Specifications.

==Applications==

ITF is often used for marking product ID numbers or other codes, of various lengths, on item cartons and multi-unit cases. One specific instance of this, standardized by GS1, is the ITF-14 bar code used to mark packages with Global Trade Item Numbers. In these uses, the ITF bar code symbol is usually printed surrounded with a thick black rectangular border called the Bearer Bar. The Bearer Bar surrounds the entire symbol and the quiet zones, abutting the ends of the bars. The purpose of a Bearer Bar is to equalize the pressure exerted by the printing plate over the entire surface of the symbol, and to enhance reading reliability by helping to reduce the probability of misreads occurring when the bar code is scanned at too large an angle so that the scanning beam crosses the top and/or bottom edge of the bar code rather than scanning across all bars, entering through the leftmost bar and exiting through the rightmost bar (or vice versa for a reverse scan). Such a &quot;short scan&quot; which does not extend through all of the bars obviously cannot result in a correct read of the complete bar code, but by the nature of the interleaved 2 of 5 code, it is possible for a short scan that begins in the middle of the bar code to begin with a pattern that corresponds to the required start pattern, or for a short scan that ends in the middle of the bar code to end with a pattern that corresponds to the required stop pattern. In this way the short scan, though incorrect, may appear to be a correct full scan. The Bearer Bar prevents this error, as a short scan will pass through the Bearer Bar as it passes across the top or bottom edge of the bar code. Since the Bearer Bar is much wider than any legitimate black bar, it will ensure that the short scan cannot appear to begin with the correct start pattern and end with the correct end pattern, forcing an invalid scan. The bar code can then be re-scanned, either automatically or manually.
On 135 film (35 mm) canisters, interleaved 2 of 5 is used to identify the manufacturer, the film type, number of exposures and proprietary information using 6 digits. The barcode is located between the electrically read silver and black DX Camera Auto-Sensing Code and the film can exit lip. It is optically scanned by many film-processing machines when the cartridge is inserted for developing.

Identcode and Leitcode are variants of interleaved 2 of 5 with check digits used by Deutsche Post.

<doc id="839479" wikidata="Q7526018" url="?curid=839479" title="Anthony Nutting">
<text>Sir Harold Anthony Nutting, 3rd Baronet (11 January 1920 – 23 February 1999) was a British diplomat and Conservative Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament from 1945 until 1956. He was a Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1954 until he resigned in 1956 in protest against the Suez invasion.

==Early and private life==
Nutting was the son of Sir Harold Stanmore Nutting, 2nd Baronet, member of a wealthy family who owned estates in England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was born in Shropshire at the private Shrewsbury Nursing Institution at Quarry House, Shrewsbury, and was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied agriculture.

Before the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Leicestershire Yeomanry as a trooper but was invalided out early in 1940 because of asthma after a steeplechase accident.

Next he entered the Foreign Service. He served as an attaché at the British Embassy in Paris. When France fell, he was assigned to the embassy in Madrid, where he organised escape routes for Allied servicemen caught behind enemy lines from 1940 to 1944. He joined the Embassy in Rome from 1944 to 1945 and was briefly private secretary to Anthony Eden, the then Foreign Secretary. Meanwhile, both of his elder brothers were killed on active duty and consequently he succeeded to the family baronetcy after the death of their father in 1972.

He married his first wife, Gillian Leonora Strutt, with whom he had three children, John, David and Zara, but they divorced in 1959. He married his second wife, Anne Gunning Parker, in 1961. After her death, in 1991, he later married his third wife, Margarita.

==Early political career==
At the 1945 general election, at 25, Nutting was elected as the MP for Melton in Leicestershire, an area involved in hunting and it was said of it that &quot;most of the voters are foxes&quot;. He served as chairman of the Young Conservatives (1946–47) and he was the youngest member of Winston Churchill&#x27;s Government in the 1950s.

He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1954 and he led the British delegation to the United Nations General Assembly and Disarmament Commission in 1954 and 1955. He was an internationalist, an early enthusiast for British membership of the European Economic Community and an Arabist who was a founding member of the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) in 1967. In the worlds of the political writer Peter Kellner, &quot;He belonged to, and was set fair to lead, a new generation of post-war Tories: moderate, inclusive and internationalist. He preferred the spirit of the United Nations Charter to the ethos of empire. He understood earlier than most of his contemporaries that Britain needed to find a new role in the world&quot;.

==Suez Crisis==
In 1954, he negotiated the final steps of the treaty with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt under which British troops withdrew from Suez; so when he discovered the joint British and French invasion plan at a meeting on 14 October 1956, he believed that the mission was mistaken and deceitful. On 31 October, despite attempts by future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to persuade him not to resign (&quot;you will lead the party one day&quot;), Nutting quit his post as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. He did not give the customary resignation speech in the House of Commons for security reasons, and his unexplained action proved so unpopular that his constituents forced him to give up his seat in Parliament. He later wrote of feeling suddenly &quot;bereft of friends... a castaway adrift on a sea of anger and recrimination, an object of distrust... torn between loyalty to principle and loyalty to friends and associates.&quot;

Nutting supported the idea of moving Iraqi troops into Jordan in response to aggressive Israeli military raids in the West Bank that were carried out in response to attacks, by the Palestinian fedayeen, on Israel. Such a deployment could have provoked war with Israel, as Britain had a defence treaty with Jordan at the time, and Jordan could appeal for British military assistance if there was any Israeli action to stop it. However, when Nutting telephoned Prime Minister Anthony Eden to press the case, Eden angrily told Nutting, &quot;I will not allow you to plunge this country into war merely to satisfy the anti-Jewish spleen of you people in the Foreign Office&quot;.

==Later life==
He kept his silence over the Suez Crisis until 1967. Then, his book, &quot;No End of a Lesson&quot;, explained that backing the Suez action would have put him in the position of lying to the House of Commons and the United Nations.

&quot;Either I had to tell the whole story as I saw it, or say nothing at all,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And as long as any of the chief protagonists of the Suez war still held high office in Britain it would clearly have been a grave disservice to the nation, which they still led and represented in the councils of the world, to have told the whole story.&quot; The crisis had caused so much bitterness that even eleven years after his resignation, he came under pressure from the Cabinet Secretary not to proceed and there was even a threat of prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.

He stood one more time, unsuccessfully, in Oldham East in 1964. In his later years, still a political outcast, he divided his time between writing biographies and histories in London, fox hunting in Shropshire and farming at Achentoul, Scotland.

In 1969, Nutting was banned from entering Israel because of a speech to students in Beirut in which he reportedly said that the Palestine question had to be resolved by force, and it was up to Palestinian guerillas to impose a solution.

Nutting was a long-standing member of the board of Middle East International, the London based bimonthly journal on Middle East events. 

He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London of heart failure on 23 February 1999, aged 79, and was cremated on 4 March at the West London Crematorium.

<text>The Han twins murder plot was a case of attempted murder of Sunny Han by her identical twin sister Jeena &quot;Jeen&quot; Han, occurring on November 6, 1996 in Irvine, California. Both are Korean-born American citizens.

Jeena Han recruited two teenage youths to capture her sister at home, but the plot went awry and the two were quickly taken into custody by local police. The jury reached their verdict as to each defendant on November 20, 1997, after ten hours&#x27; deliberation. Jeena Han was convicted of all charges including one count of conspiracy to commit murder, two counts of burglary (one in the first and another in the second degree), two counts of false imprisonment, and one count of a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. The jury also found that Jeena Han was armed with a firearm during the commission of each offense.

Jeena Han was imprisoned at the Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla, California, in 1998 with a sentence of 26 years to life in prison. She was given an additional year because the jury found the firearm enhancement to be true. Twenty years later, in May 2018, she was granted parole by California&#x27;s Board of Parole. Jeen received support from Sunny for parole.

==Aftermath==
In 1999, the case was featured in the book &quot;Evil Twins&quot; by John Glatt.

In November 1999, an &quot;American Justice&quot; documentary titled &quot;Sister Against Sister: The Twin Murder Plot&quot; aired on A&amp;E, covering the sensational details of the case. The program was hosted by Bill Kurtis.

In 2001, the case was profiled on &quot;The Investigators&quot; under the title &quot;Evil Twin&quot;.

In 2005, &quot;Snapped&quot;, a series about true crime on the Oxygen Network, ran an episode about Jeen&#x27;s plot to kill her twin sister and take over her life.

In 2012, this story became the focus of the pilot episode of the &quot;Investigation Discovery&quot; show, &quot;Evil Twins&quot;.

In 2024, the case was featured in Stephanie Soo&#x27;s podcast &quot;Rotten Mango&quot; on Spotify, on June 2nd, 2024.

<doc id="839502" wikidata="Q462519" url="?curid=839502" title="Visi On">
<text>Visi On (also known as VisiOn) is an operating environment for IBM PCs and compatibles running DOS, developed by VisiCorp and released in December 1983. Visi On was the first piece of software with a graphical user interface (GUI) for the IBM PC platform. It was also one of the first GUIs available on any personal computer. Visi On was never popular, as it had steep minimum system requirements for its day, but it was influential in the development of later GUIs like Microsoft Windows.

VisiCorp had programs for sale that were compatible with VisiOn, including a spreadsheet program called &quot;VisiOn Calc&quot;. (Not to be confused with VisiCalc).

One of Visi On&#x27;s features was an hourglass cursor that indicated when the system was loading data from a disk. At the time, most software would display words on the screen like &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;please wait&quot; instead.

==History==

===Background===
In the spring of 1981, Personal Software was cash-flush from the ever-increasing sales of VisiCalc, and the corporate directors sat down and planned out their future directions. Ed Esber introduced the concept of a &quot;family&quot; of products that could be sold together, but from a technical perspective none of their products were similar in anything but name. For instance, to use VisiPlot with VisiCalc data, the numbers to be plotted had to be exported in a &quot;raw&quot; format and then re-imported.

Dan Fylstra led a technical discussion on what sorts of actions the user would need to be able to accomplish in order for their products to be truly integrated. They decided that there were three key concepts. One was universal data exchange, which would be supported by a set of common data structures used in all of their programs. Another was a common, consistent interface so users would not have to re-learn the UI as they moved from one program to another. Finally, Fylstra was concerned that the time needed to move from one program to another was too long to be useful – a user needing to quickly look something up in VisiDex would have to save and exit VisiCalc, look up the information, and then quit that and re-launch VisiCalc again. This process had to be made quicker and simpler.

===Creation===
In July 1981, Xerox announced the Xerox Star, an advanced workstation computer featuring a graphical user interface (GUI), and by that point it was a well known &quot;secret&quot; that Apple Computer was working on a low-cost computer with a GUI that would later be released as the Apple Lisa. Personal Software&#x27;s president, Terry Opdendyk, knew of a two-man team in Texas that was working on a GUI, and arranged for Scott Warren and Dennis Abbe to visit Personal Software&#x27;s headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. They demonstrated a version of the Smalltalk programming language running on the TRS-80 microcomputer, a seriously underpowered machine for the task. Personal Software was extremely impressed.

A contract was soon signed, and work on project &quot;Quasar&quot; started almost immediately. The name was shortly thereafter changed to Visi On, a play on &quot;vision&quot; that retained their &quot;Visi&quot; naming. An experimental port to the ill-fated Apple III was completed in November, and after that, development work shifted to the DEC VAX, which had cross-compilers for a number of different machines. In early 1982 Personal Software changed their name to VisiCorp, and was betting much of the future success of the company on Visi On.

Visi On had many features of a modern GUI, and included a few that did not become common until many years later. It was fully mouse-driven, used a bit-mapped display for both text and graphics, included on-line help, and allowed the user to open a number of programs at once, each in its own window. Visi On did not, however, include a graphical file manager. Visi On also demanded a hard drive in order to implement its virtual memory system used for &quot;fast switching&quot;, and at the time hard drives were very expensive.

Shortly after Apple introduced the Lisa, VisiCorp announced that it was developing Visi On.

In an interview before the launch of the original Macintosh, Steve Jobs claimed that neither VisiOn nor Microsoft&#x27;s Windows would be the standard windowing software on IBM PCs, instead saying that IBM&#x27;s own windowing software would become the standard.

===COMDEX demo===
Tom Powers, VisiCorp&#x27;s new VP of marketing, pushed for the system to be demonstrated at the fall COMDEX show in 1982. Others in the company were worried that the product was not ready for shipping, and that showing it so early would leave potential customers and distributors upset if it wasn&#x27;t ready soon after. Another concern was that VisiWord was being released at the same show, and there was some worry that it might be lost in the shuffle.

The demonstrations at COMDEX were a huge success. Many viewers had to be told it was not simply a movie they were watching, and Bill Gates speculated that the PC was in fact simply a terminal for a &quot;real&quot; machine like a VAX. It became one of the most talked-about products in the industry. However this huge success led to a number of very serious problems.

In separate June and July 1983 &quot;Byte&quot; articles, the company mentioned a late summer 1983 release.

===Corporate civil war===

While Visi On development continued, VisiCorp as an entity was in the process of self-destruction. Terry Opdendyk, the president hand-picked by the early venture capital investors, had an extremely autocratic management style that led to the departure of many key executives. From late 1981 to the eventual release of Visi On, most of the product management of the company left, notably Mitch Kapor in charge of VisiCalc development, Ed Esber, Roy Folk, Visi On&#x27;s product marketing manager, among others. This was referred to as &quot;corporate civil war&quot;.

It was Mitch Kapor&#x27;s departure that would prove most devastating to the company, however. Kapor, developer of VisiPlot and VisiTrend, had been pressing for the development of a greatly improved spreadsheet to succeed VisiCalc, but Opdendyk was uninterested. This was during a time when VisiCorp and VisiCalc&#x27;s developers were at an impasse, and VisiCalc was growing increasingly outdated. When Kapor decided to leave, the other executives pressed for a clause forbidding Kapor to work on an &quot;integrated spreadsheet&quot;, but Opdendyk couldn&#x27;t be bothered, exclaiming &quot;Kapor is a spaghetti programmer&quot;, denigrating his abilities.

Kapor would go on to release Lotus 1-2-3, which became a major competitor to VisiCalc in 1983. By the end of the year, sales had been cut in half. Combined with the exodus of major portions of the senior executive staff and the ongoing battle with VisiCalc&#x27;s developers, VisiCorp was soon in serious financial difficulty. All hopes for the company&#x27;s future were placed on Visi On.

The October 31, 1983 &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, in an article titled, &quot;Finally, Visi On is here,&quot; flatly stated: &quot;the... publisher is putting the product on computer store shelves... Visi On was scheduled to be available during the last week in October&quot;. The November 14, 1983 issue said: &quot;VisiCorp has just released Visi On.&quot; However, the July 2, 1984 issue says: &quot;By the time Visi On was actually shipped on December 16, 1983...&quot; and &quot;PC Magazine&quot; reported in the February 7, 1984 issue that they still hadn&#x27;t received the product in its commercially available form.

==Release==
The operating system, known as the Visi On Applications Manager, was released in December 1983 and sold for $495, requiring a mouse for another $250.

===Reception===
The main disadvantage of Visi On was its extremely high system requirements by 1982 standards. It needed 512 kilobytes of RAM and a hard disk at a time when PCs shipped with 64k-128k and IBM did not yet offer a hard disk with the PC (IBM&#x27;s first model with a hard drive, the PC XT, didn&#x27;t ship until March 1983). Third-party drives were however available at the time, typically 5MB units that connected to the floppy controller and were treated by the operating system as an oversized floppy disk (there was no subdirectory support). This brought the total cost of running Visi On to $7500, three-quarters the cost of the Apple Lisa.

The press continued to laud the product, going so far as to claim it represented &quot;the end of operating systems&quot;. The end-users were less impressed, however, not only due to the high cost of the required hardware, but also the general slowness of the system. In a market where computers were generally used for only one or two tasks, usually business related, the whole purpose of Visi On was seriously diluted.

In January 1984, Apple Computer released the Macintosh with much fanfare. Although the Macintosh was seriously lacking software, it was faster, cheaper, and included one feature Visi On lacked: a graphical file manager (the Finder). Although it didn&#x27;t compete directly with Visi On, which was really a &quot;PC product&quot;, it nevertheless demonstrated that a GUI could indeed be fast and relatively inexpensive, both of which Visi On failed to deliver.

Adding to the release&#x27;s problems was Bill Gates, who took a page from VisiCorp&#x27;s book and announced that their own product, Microsoft Windows, would be available in May 1984. This muddied the waters significantly, notably when he further claimed it would have a similar feature set, didn&#x27;t require a hard disk, and cost only $250. Windows was released with an even longer delay than Visi On, shipping in November 1985, and was lacking the features that forced Visi On to demand a hard drive.

===End of life===
Only eight VisiCorp employees were still developing Visi On when VisiCorp sold the source code to Control Data in mid-1984 to raise cash as it sued Software Arts, while continuing to sell the software itself. Sales were apparently very slow; in February 1985, VisiCorp responded by lowering the price of the basic OS to $99, knowing that anyone purchasing it would also need to buy the applications. These were bundled, all three for $990. This improved the situation somewhat, but sales were still far below projections, and it was certainly not helping the company stave off the problems due to Lotus 1-2-3.

Following declining VisiCalc sales and low revenues from Visi On, in November 1985, the company merged with Paladin Software. The new company kept the Paladin name. VisiCorp, and its line of &quot;VisiProducts&quot;, were history.

==Technical information==
Official system requirements for Visi On were:
#512K of User Memory
#RS-232 Serial Port
#5 Megabyte Hard Disk (FAT12 file system )
#1 Floppy Disk Drive, DS/DD, 40 Track, 48 tpi
#VisiCorp Mouse (Mouse Systems-compatible mice)
#MS-DOS 2.0
#Graphics Adapter compatible with CGA 640x200 monochrome mode
#Computer monitor capable of displaying CGA 640x200

It will work on newer PCs, but requires a compatible mouse and hard disk partition under 15MB as only the FAT12 file system is supported. In addition, as it revectors some IRQs used by PC/ATs and later, VISIONXT.EXE requires modifications which prevent Graph and other applications from functioning properly.

Visi On required Mouse Systems-compatible mice; Microsoft-compatible PC mice, which over time became the standard, were introduced later (in May 1983). Visi On used two mouse drivers. First, loaded in text mode, made mouse registers accessible to the embedded driver, which translated coordinates to cursor position. This internal driver, built-in as a subroutine into VISIONXT.EXE, required Mouse Systems PC-Mouse pointing device. It is not compatible with the Microsoft Mouse standard.

Writing Visi On applications required a Unix development environment. Visi On was targeted toward high-end (expensive) PC workstations. Visi On applications were written in a subset of C VisiC, and a third-party could have ported the core software (VisiHost, VisiMachine virtual machine, VISIONXT.EXE in IBM PC DOS version) to Unix, but that never occurred. In 1984, VisiCorp&#x27;s assets were sold off to Control Data Corporation.

Making working copies of the original floppy disks using modern methods is difficult - they are protected using pre-created bad sectors and other methods of floppy disk identification.

<text>Of the Solar System&#x27;s eight planets and its nine most likely dwarf planets, six planets and seven dwarf planets are known to be orbited by at least 300 natural satellites, or moons. At least 19 of them are large enough to be gravitationally rounded; of these, all are covered by a crust of ice except for Earth&#x27;s Moon and Jupiter&#x27;s Io. Several of the largest ones are in hydrostatic equilibrium and would therefore be considered dwarf planets or planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun and not in their current states (orbiting planets or dwarf planets).

Moons are classed into two separate categories according to their orbits: regular moons, which have prograde orbits (they orbit in the direction of their planets&#x27; rotation) and lie close to the plane of their equators, and irregular moons, whose orbits can be pro- or retrograde (against the direction of their planets&#x27; rotation) and often lie at extreme angles to their planets&#x27; equators. Irregular moons are probably minor planets that have been captured from surrounding space. Most irregular moons are less than in diameter.

The earliest published discovery of a moon other than Earth&#x27;s was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries, only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; missions, saw a surge in the number of moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular. 
== Moons by primary ==

Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet, has no moons, or at least none that can be detected to a diameter of . For a very short time in 1974, Mercury was thought to have a moon.

Venus also has no moons, though reports of a moon around Venus have circulated since the 17th century.

Earth has one Moon, the largest moon of any rocky planet in the Solar System and the largest body typically described as a moon that orbits anything in hydrostatic equilibrium in relation to the primary object by mass and diameter other than Charon and Pluto, the latter two being dwarf planets revolving around each other. Earth also has more than 20 known co-orbitals, including the asteroids 3753 Cruithne and 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, and the occasional temporary satellite, like 2020 CD3; however, since they do not permanently orbit Earth, they are not considered moons. (See Other moons of Earth and Quasi-satellite.)

Mars has two known moons, Phobos and Deimos (&quot;fear&quot; and &quot;dread&quot;, after attendants of Ares, the Greek god of war, equivalent to the Roman Mars). Searches for more satellites have been unsuccessful, putting the maximum radius of any other satellites at .

Jupiter has 95 moons with known orbits; 72 of them have received permanent designations, and 57 have been named. Its eight regular moons are grouped into the planet-sized Galilean moons and the far smaller Amalthea group. They were named after lovers of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of Jupiter. Among them is Ganymede, the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System. Its 87 known irregular moons are organized into two categories: prograde and retrograde. The prograde satellites consist of the Himalia group and three others in groups of one. The retrograde moons are grouped into the Carme, Ananke and Pasiphae groups.

Saturn has 146 moons with known orbits; 66 of them have received permanent designations, and 63 have been named. Most of them are quite small. Seven moons are large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, including Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System. Including these large moons, 24 of Saturn&#x27;s moons are regular, and traditionally named after Titans or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. The remaining 122 are irregular, and classified by their orbital characteristics into Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies the groups are named after. The rings of Saturn are made up of icy objects ranging in size from one centimetre to hundreds of metres, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet. Thus, a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn&#x27;s ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. At least 150 &quot;moonlets&quot; embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.

Uranus has 28 known moons, five of which are massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium. There are 13 moons that orbit within Uranus&#x27;s ring system, and another ten outer irregular moons. Unlike most planetary moons, which are named from antiquity, all the moons of Uranus are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope&#x27;s work &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;.

Neptune has 16 known moons; the largest, Triton, accounts for more than 99.5 percent of all the mass orbiting the planet. Triton is large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but, uniquely for a large moon, has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it was a dwarf planet that was captured. Neptune also has seven known inner regular satellites, and eight outer irregular satellites.

Pluto, a dwarf planet, has five moons. Its largest moon Charon, named after the ferryman who took souls across the River Styx, is more than half as large as Pluto itself, and large enough to orbit a point outside Pluto&#x27;s surface. In effect, each orbits the other, forming a binary system informally referred to as a double-dwarf-planet. Pluto&#x27;s four other moons, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx are far smaller and orbit the Pluto–Charon system.

Among the other dwarf planets, has no known moons. It is 90 percent certain that Ceres has no moons larger than 1 km in size, assuming that they would have the same albedo as Ceres itself. has one large known moon, Dysnomia. Accurately determining its size is difficult: one indicative estimate of its radius is .

Two objects were named as dwarf planets, under the expectation that they would prove to be so (though this remains uncertain). has two moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka, of radii ~195 and ~100 km, respectively. has one moon, discovered in April 2016.

A number of other objects in the Kuiper belt and scattered disk may turn out to be dwarf planets. , , , and are generally agreed to be dwarf planets among astronomers, and all but Sedna are known to have moons. A number of other smaller objects, such as , , , , and , also have moons, although their dwarf planethood is more doubtful. This list includes all objects with a best estimated diameter above 400 km that are considered likely or official dwarf planets by other sources and astronomers, including whose satellite has not been seen since its initial discovery.

, 365 asteroid moons and 128 trans-Neptunian moons (including those of Pluto and the other dwarf planets) had been discovered.



Due to Earth&#x27;s varying distance from these planets (as well as their distance to the Sun), the limits at which we are able to detect new moons are very inconsistent. As the below graph demonstrates, the maximum absolute magnitude (total inherent brightness, abbreviated H) of moons we have detected around planets occurs at H = 18 for Jupiter, H = 17 for Saturn, H = 14 for Uranus, and H = 12 for Neptune. Smaller moons may (and most likely do) exist around each of these planets, but are currently undetectable from Earth. Although spacecraft have visited all of these planets, Earth-based telescopes continue to outperform them in moon-detection ability due to their greater availability for wide-field surveys.

== List ==

This is a list of the recognized moons of the planets and of the largest potential dwarf planets of the Solar System, ordered by their official Roman numeral designations. Moons that do not yet have official Roman numeral designations (because their orbits are not yet known well enough) are listed after those that do.

The 19 moons that are known to be large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity are listed in bold. The seven largest moons, which are larger than any of the known dwarf planets, are listed in bold and italic. Sidereal period differs from semi-major axis because a moon&#x27;s speed depends both on the mass of its primary and its distance from it.

<doc id="839508" wikidata="Q869912" url="?curid=839508" title="Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain">
<text>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain is the second studio album by American indie rock band Pavement, released on February 14, 1994 by Matador Records. The album saw the band move on towards a more accessible rock sound than that of their more lo-fi debut &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; and achieve moderate success with the single &quot;Cut Your Hair&quot;. The album also saw original drummer Gary Young replaced by Steve West. It was a UK Top 20 hit upon release, although it was not so successful in the US charts.

==Release==
&quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; was released on February 14, 1994, by Matador Records. As of 2009, the album had sold about 500,000 copies.

In 2004, Matador released &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA&#x27;s Desert Origins&quot;, a compilation containing the album in its entirety, as well outtakes and other rarities from the same era.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave &quot;Crooked Rain&quot; a perfect five-star rating, describing it as &quot;the &quot;Reckoning&quot; to &quot;Slanted &amp; Enchanted&quot;″s &quot;Murmur&quot;&quot;. He concluded that the album was &quot;a vibrant, dynamic, emotionally resonant album that stands as a touchstone of underground rock in the &#x27;90s and one of the great albums of its decade.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;the Village Voice&quot; gave the album an A grade, describing it as &quot;a tour de force melodywise&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; David Browne gave the album a B+, writing that &quot;&quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; is just a bunch of guys dwelling on topics like skateboarding, plane crashes, girls, and mocking Stone Temple Pilots. When they set those sentiments to bumpy-road drones or a bit of a country lilt...the result has a subtle, ingratiating beauty.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Richard Cromelin gave the album 3.5 out of 4 stars. Cromelin wrote that the album contains &quot;some of the Meat Puppets&#x27; loopiness, a Stones/Burritos folk-country resonance, and a chirpy pop tunefulness--along with enough contrary abrasiveness to keep you from getting too comfortable with them.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2003, the album was ranked number 210 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 212 in a 2012 revised list. In the 2020 update of the list, the album&#x27;s rank dropped to number 434. It was also ranked number 10 on their best albums of the Nineties. In 2003, it was ranked number 8 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list Top 100 Albums of the 1990s, and in 2010, the song &quot;Gold Soundz&quot; was listed as number one on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s 200 Greatest Songs of the 1990s. In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; at number 21 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. The photo in the middle of the cover was taken from the March 1978 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="839511" wikidata="Q2249109" url="?curid=839511" title="Wowee Zowee">
<text>Wowee Zowee is the third studio album by American indie rock band Pavement, released on April 11, 1995 by Matador Records. Most of it was recorded at Easley Recording in Memphis, Tennessee, where some members of the band had previously worked on Silver Jews&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Starlite Walker&quot;. The album showcases a more experimental side of the band, marking a return to the clatter and unpredictability of their early recordings after the more accessible sound of their 1994 studio album &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;. Its eclectic nature ranges from mellow yet distorted melodies to noise and punk rock, while the lyrics generally explore humorous and cryptic themes. At nearly one hour long, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; is Pavement&#x27;s longest studio album, filling three sides of a vinyl record. Side four was left blank.

Upon release, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, being generally deemed as a sloppy effort in comparison to its acclaimed predecessor. However, some reviewers highlighted its adventurous style and Stephen Malkmus&#x27; lyricism. Two songs from the album, &quot;Rattled by the Rush&quot; and &quot;Father to a Sister of Thought&quot;, were released as singles in 1995, but neither were successful. Despite being notable for ruining any opportunity Pavement had to capitalize on the success of &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; has retrospectively been reappraised in highly positive terms, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; including it in the magazine&#x27;s 2020 edition of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. A compilation containing the album in its entirety as well as B-sides and other rarities, titled &quot;Wowee Zowee: Sordid Sentinels Edition&quot;, was released in 2006.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; is the follow-up to Pavement&#x27;s acclaimed second studio album &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;, which was released in February 1994 and ranked No. 2 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. Although the band was starting to get some attention from the mainstream press, they were not interested in signing to a major label. Eight months after the release of their second album, having toured non-stop for two years, Pavement decided to record their next album at Easley Recording in Memphis, Tennessee. Singer and guitarist Stephen Malkmus, percussionist Bob Nastanovich, and drummer Steve West were familiar with the place because they had already worked on Silver Jews&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Starlite Walker&quot; there. Unlike previous Pavement albums, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; was recorded with all five members in attendance.

Although the recording sessions only lasted from November 14 to 24, 1994, Pavement recorded many songs. Some were outtakes from &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; that were re-recorded with better equipment, while others had already been part of the band&#x27;s setlist for a year. Singer and guitarist Scott Kannberg also wrote a few songs. Previously, he would occasionally write some pieces for Malkmus to sing, but Malkmus encouraged him to sing his own songs this time. The recording sessions, which typically started at noon and ended by 10pm, were very spontaneous. According to Malkmus, &quot;it was just sprawl, just do whatever you want, and don&#x27;t worry about it fitting together. The less it fits together, the better.&quot; Pavement really enjoyed Memphis&#x27; relaxed vibe, and would often go out in between sessions to eat at barbecues and drink beer. When the recording sessions concluded, the band mixed and overdubbed the tracks at Random Falls in Manhattan, New York City in February 10–14, 1995, the same studio where they had recorded &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;.

&quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; is the only Pavement album that was entirely sequenced by Malkmus. The band ended up with more than 20 songs to choose from and originally considered the possibility of putting them all on a record. Kannberg, who had sequenced their previous albums, preferred a cohesive set of roughly 10 songs that would flow together, but Malkmus was keen to include songs that were considered B-sides by the band. Ultimately, a total of 18 songs were included on the album, filling three sides of a vinyl record. Side four was left blank, with an empty thought bubble printed on the label. At nearly one hour long, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; is Pavement&#x27;s longest studio album. Malkmus explained that, in his mind, everything made sense. He also described the opening track, &quot;We Dance&quot;, as &quot;a little torch song thing&quot;, and felt that the track would work as a good introduction to the album because it would show that the band was doing something different.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; showcases a more experimental side of Pavement, returning them to the clatter and unpredictability of their early recordings after the more accessible sound of &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;. Distortion and feedback are often combined with mellow melodies, resulting in many songs having unusual structures and disjointed musical styles. Noise rock is prevalent on some tracks, like &quot;Serpentine Pad&quot; and &quot;Best Friends Arm&quot;, while &quot;Flux = Rad&quot; is a punk song that was described as reminiscent of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;. The opening track &quot;We Dance&quot; is a ballad that features acoustic guitars and piano, while &quot;Father to a Sister of Thought&quot; is a quasi-alternative country song that uses a pedal steel guitar. Malkmus played a Gibson SG with P-90 pickups on &quot;Rattled by the Rush&quot;, which also features occasional harmonica at points. Due to higher production values, the album generally lacks the lo-fi aesthetic of its predecessors.

Most lyrics on &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; explore humorous and cryptic themes. Although many songs give the impression that their lyrics are nonsensical, they can unpack a meaning on further inspection. For example, &quot;Grounded&quot;, which suggests that something bad might happen after a doctor leaves for a routine holiday while his unsupervised teenage daughter parties, can be interpreted as an account of middle class decadence. The song &quot;Half a Canyon&quot; mostly focuses on an over-driven guitar sound that Malkmus had never heard before. The lyrics are meaningless and were simply added for decoration; Malkmus said that he screamed so hard towards the end of the song that he scared himself. He thought that he would have an aneurysm and decided to never scream like that again. Kannberg&#x27;s &quot;Kennel District&quot;, which was described as a fuzzy power pop song, is considered one of the album&#x27;s most accessible songs because it features a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure.

==Packaging and release==
The cover art for &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; is a painting by American artist Steve Keene, who caricatured it from a photograph originally found in &quot;Life&quot; magazine″s 1972 World Library title &quot;The Arab World&quot;. It depicts two Arab women and a goat. Omitted from Keene&#x27;s photograph is a girl in a tan dress holding a baby, stationed between the two sitting women. The caption below the original photo reads, &quot;A midday rest is enjoyed by three Arab women and a goat on an arbor-shaded porch. Fellahin women often wear black robes over their other clothing.&quot; Malkmus saw the artwork during a live painting session at one of Keene&#x27;s exhibitions. He chose the piece due to its resemblance to the front cover of Guru Guru&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Känguru&quot;, one that he had always admired. The album&#x27;s title is a homage to the band&#x27;s former drummer Gary Young, who would frequently yell &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; when excited. The phrase &quot;Dick-Sucking Fool at Pussy-Licking School&quot; was originally suggested by Nastanovich as a potential title for &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot;, but it was discarded after being considered too risky. Nevertheless, the phrase was included in the album&#x27;s booklet art. The would-be title was a nod to the Rolling Stones&#x27; documentary film &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot;.

&quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; was released on April 11, 1995, by Matador Records. Big Cat Records and Domino Records issued the album in Europe, Fellaheen Records released it in Australia, and King and Pony Canyon released &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; in Japan. The album peaked at number 18 on the UK Albums Chart and number 25 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. Malkmus chose the songs &quot;Rattled by the Rush&quot; and &quot;Father to a Sister of Thought&quot; to be released as singles on March 30 and June 27, 1995, respectively, but they were not successful. He would later recall that, while his judgment may have been clouded by excessive marijuana usage, both songs &quot;sounded like hits&quot; to him. To promote &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot;, the band was planning to organize their own festival with fellow bands such as Sonic Youth, the Breeders, and Beck. However, after Sonic Youth was chosen to headline the Lollapalooza music festival in the summer of 1995, they asked for Pavement to be on the bill. Performing at Lollapalooza became the highest profile appearance for the band and gave them an opportunity to earn a lot of money. In early 1996, they performed a few more shows in Australia, Japan, and the US.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; was met with mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Mark Kemp described it as a &quot;scattered and sloppy&quot; effort with &quot;half-baked&quot; performances by Malkmus and Kannberg. He also speculated that the relative success of &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; was a reason for the album&#x27;s eclectic nature, claiming that Pavement were afraid of success. Similarly, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editor Lorraine Ali called &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; &quot;a sloppy effort, even in Pavement terms&quot;, and concluded that the album &quot;comes off lazy and unfinished, never attempting to reach out or connect as previous albums did&quot;. Kevin McKeough of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt that the album was inconsistent, highlighting the songs &quot;Rattled by the Rush&quot;, &quot;Grounded&quot;, and &quot;Kennel District&quot; as &quot;thrilling pleasures&quot;, but criticized Malkmus&#x27; &quot;insufferably mannered vocals&quot; on &quot;Brinx Job&quot;, his &quot;tiresome grunge rant&quot; on &quot;Serpentine Pad&quot;, and his &quot;gratuitous screaming&quot; at the end of &quot;Half a Canyon&quot;.

In a very negative review, Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; difficult to enjoy, stating that it &quot;probably helps to be a 15-year-old boy to appreciate Pavement&quot;, and believed the band does not &quot;release albums so much as in-jokes and their fourth continues the tradition&quot;. She added that Malkmus&#x27; &quot;monotone occasionally gives way to a pained little yips&quot; and Kannberg &quot;sometimes hits on a lifting melody, but mostly he sounds as confused as his colleagues&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; writer Eric Weisbard reacted with muted praise, noting the album&#x27;s &quot;impressively distinct range of sounds and moods&quot;, while criticizing Malkmus&#x27; unconvincing vocal delivery. He concluded that the album is best enjoyed &quot;at a casual low volume, with little attention paid to the effort and details&quot;.

Other critics were more positive. Writing for &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, editor Michael Vazquez considered &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; a solid and ambitious album, praising its adventurous style and Malkmus&#x27; rich lyricism, but acknowledged that several listens are required for appreciation. &quot;Select&quot; editor Roy Wilkinson felt that the album has a lot of Pavement&#x27;s &quot;lazy elegance&quot; and compared the &quot;elegiac sweeps&quot; of &quot;We Dance&quot; to David Bowie&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was the album&#x27;s boldest defender, praising Pavement for favoring lyricism over commerciality. He also felt that the album was mellow and rarely chaotic, concluding: &quot;if their vocation is beguiling song-music that doesn&#x27;t sound like anything else or create its own rut, this reinforces one&#x27;s gut feeling that they can do it forever.&quot; Despite the middling reviews from most critics, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; was ranked number 17 in the 1995 Pazz &amp; Jop poll.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; ruined any opportunity Pavement had to capitalize on the success of &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;. By June 2009, the album had sold 129,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan, a notable drop-off from its predecessor, which had sold 246,000 copies. Kannberg acknowledged that the band felt a bit under pressure to release a follow-up to &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot;, and that &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; would have been much different if they had given themselves more time to think about it. As a result, Pavement decided to be more patient and work on tidier arrangements for their next studio album, &quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; (1997). Kannberg regards &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; with mixed feelings and considers it his least favorite Pavement record. Conversely, when asked about his favorite Pavement album, Malkmus said, &quot;It would be one of the first three ones, but for different reasons.&quot; In 1997, Nastanovich stated that &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; is his favorite Pavement record.

Retrospectively, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; has been reappraised in highly positive terms and is frequently viewed by many &quot;diehard&quot; Pavement fans as the band&#x27;s best work. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that repeated listenings reveal the album to be &quot;a dense collage of &#x27;90s rock &amp; roll that recasts the past and present into one rich, kaleidoscopic, and blissfully cryptic world view&quot;. Nina Corcoran of &quot;Consequence&quot; said that &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; has become &quot;the beloved oddball in Pavement&#x27;s discography&quot;, and assumed that the band &quot;knew what they were doing all along, even if we were reluctant to believe them at first&quot;. In 2006, Matador released &quot;Wowee Zowee: Sordid Sentinels Edition&quot;, a compilation containing &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; in its entirety, as well as B-sides, outtakes, radio shots, live songs, and compilation tracks from the same era.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Rob Sheffield, &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; has come to be widely viewed as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Sheffield explained that people started to appreciate &quot;Wowee Zowee&quot; after the band released &quot;Brighten the Corners&quot;, a radical departure that put the album&#x27;s eclectic nature into perspective. He also remarked that the former was overshadowed by other successful Matador releases, such as &quot;Alien Lanes&quot; by Guided by Voices and &quot;Electr-O-Pura&quot; by Yo La Tengo. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album 265th in its updated list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time—ahead of &quot;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&quot; and behind Pavement&#x27;s 1992 debut album, &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot;, which were ranked 434th and 199th, respectively. Several musicians, including American pianist Johnny Iguana, American multi-instrumentalist Jeff Rosenstock, and Filipino-British singer-songwriter Beabadoobee, cited the album as having a profound impact on them.

<text>Redeemer Lutheran College is a co-educational Lutheran primary and secondary school in Rochedale, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Founded in 1980 by Robin Kleinschmidt and other Lutherans in the south of Brisbane, the College currently educates students from years Prep to 12. The college currently has no principal, however the acting principal is Richard Cornish.

==Location and grounds==
Redeemer is located in Brisbane City in a semi-rural environment. The College campus has much open space, with no building exceeding two stories in height large path infrastructure crossing the grounds.

==Doctrinal emphasis==
Redeemer focuses on promoting the Lutheran denomination of the Christian faith; however adherents of any belief or none are accepted. Religious instruction is provided via 150 minutes of &quot;Christian Studies&quot; every week from years 6 to 12, and morning devotions in the chapel and in home rooms.
Staff are expected to uphold a Christian lifestyle, although there is no official definition of that lifestyle, and most staff members are practising Christians. RLC has a chaplaincy service which is responsible for devotions and other expressions of religious life.

==Educational standards==
Most senior school-leavers score strongly in the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR), with roughly 20% of the graduating cohort achieving an ATAR of 90–99.

==Extra-curricular==
RLC offers sporting opportunities and competition to musical competitions and debating under the auspices of the Queensland Debating Union. The college has won music competitions such as MusicFest, Queensland Youth Music Awards and the Gold Coast Eisteddfod.
It houses many different music ensembles at varying difficulty. There is a broad selection of Concert Bands, String Orchestras, Choirs, Chamber Ensembles and Jazz Groups. As well as varying quartets named after notable school figures such as Robin Kleinschmidt.
Sport teams compete in the Greater Brisbane Conference. Redeemer sports Cricket, Touch, Basketball, Volleyball, Netball, AFL, Soccer, and Indoor Cricket, among other sports and physical activity opportunities.

==History==
The school was founded in 1980 by L. Robin Kleinschmidt, an Australian Lutheran educationalist. He served as headmaster of St Peters Lutheran College, Brisbane and was responsible in part for encouraging the theatrical talents of a young Sigrid Thornton.

Kleinschmidt served as headmaster of Redeemer College from foundation to 2001 and was responsible for the construction of most of the modern campus. His influence on the school can still be seen, particularly in the field of Debating, where the Inter-House Debating Trophy is known as the Robin Kleinschmidt Trophy. The school&#x27;s music centre, which was erected in 1999, was renamed the Robin Kleinschmidt centre.

==Controversies==
Helen Darville made claims in interviews regarding her school experiences that she had been looked down upon for being at the school on a scholarship and also that she had befriended a Croatian girl who had been bullied by other students. The College refuted both claims, demonstrating that it had never had a scholarship program (although limited bursaries existed and continue to exist for already-enrolled students in need) and that there were no students of Croatian ethnicity enrolled at the time of Darville&#x27;s enrolment. Then-headmaster, L. Robin Kleinschmidt, viewed these claims with contempt many years after the fact, as detailed in his memoirs.

Warren Schneider, a former teacher at the school, was charged, prosecuted, and later convicted of paedophilia. It was proven that events took place on a school camp in 2002, with Schneider providing alcohol to female students and playing sexually charged games of truth or dare with them. Schneider was jailed for 15 months, suspended after 5 months. In a second case in October 2007, Schneider pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and many cases of indecent dealings with students of both Redeemer College and another school at which he had previously taught. The school released a statement advising, &quot;The college sincerely regrets that these events occurred,&quot; and stated in a newsletter, &quot;It&#x27;s been a difficult week for our community in the wake of the conviction of former teacher Warren Schneider.&quot; However, the school has not to date issued an apology to the victims of the abuse.

<doc id="839523" wikidata="Q1147983" url="?curid=839523" title="Cynghanedd">
<text>In Welsh-language poetry, cynghanedd (, literally &quot;harmony&quot;) is the basic concept of sound-arrangement within one line, using stress, alliteration and rhyme. The various forms of &quot;cynghanedd&quot; show up in the definitions of all formal Welsh verse forms, such as the &quot;awdl&quot; and &quot;cerdd dafod&quot;. Though of ancient origin, &quot;cynghanedd&quot; and variations of it are still used today by many Welsh-language poets. A number of poets have experimented with using &quot;cynghanedd&quot; in English-language verse, for instance Gerard Manley Hopkins. Some of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s work is also influenced by &quot;cynghanedd&quot;.

== Forms of &quot;cynghanedd&quot; ==

Note that ⟨dd⟩, ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ch⟩ are digraphs in the Welsh alphabet, each representing a single consonant /ð/, /ɬ/ and /χ/ respectively.

=== &quot;Cynghanedd groes&quot; (&quot;cross-harmony&quot;) ===

All consonants surrounding the main stressed vowel before the caesura must be repeated after it in the same order. However, the final consonants of the final words of each half of the line must be different, as must the main stressed vowel of each half. For example, from the poem &quot;&quot;, by the fifteenth-century poet Gwerful Mechain:

Here we see the pattern {C L Dd Dd [stress] L} present on both sides of the caesura. The main stressed vowels are ⟨a⟩ (a short monophthong) and ⟨wy⟩ (the diphthong /uj/).

In &quot;cynghanedd groes&quot; there are generally no consonants in the second half of the line which are not part of the consonantal echoing (there are exceptions, especially in the case of at the beginning of the half and, as mentioned above, a line-final consonant). The vowels other than those under the main stresses may be of any kind.

=== &quot;Cynghanedd draws&quot; (partial &quot;cross-harmony&quot;) ===

Exactly as in &quot;cynghanedd groes&quot;, except that there are consonants at the beginning of the second half of the line which are not present in the series of &#x27;echoed&#x27; consonants. &quot;Cynghanedd draws&quot; appears in this line from R. Williams Parry:

Here the consonant sequence {Rh Ch Dd [stress]} is repeated with different stressed vowels (short ⟨e⟩ and long ⟨â⟩). It will be noticed that the ⟨n⟩ at the end of the first half plays no part in the &quot;cynghanedd&quot;: the line-final word &quot;iâ&quot; instead ends in a vowel; if this word also ended in an ⟨n⟩, there would be generic rhyme between the two words, which is not permitted in &quot;cynghanedd&quot;.

Note that the {D N} of the second half of the line is also not part of the &quot;cynghanedd&quot;: this is the difference between &quot;cynghanedd groes&quot; and &quot;cynghanedd draws&quot;. There may be any number of unanswered consonants in this part of the line, as long as the initial sequence of consonants and accent is repeated; compare an extreme possibility in a line of Dafydd ap Gwilym&#x27;s The Girls of Llanbadarn, where only one syllable is repeated:

(Words beginning with ⟨h⟩ are treated as beginning with a vowel.)

=== &quot;Cynghanedd sain&quot; (&quot;sound-harmony&quot;) ===

The &quot;cynghanedd sain&quot; is characterised by internal rhyme. If the line is divided into three sections by its two caesuras, the first and second sections rhyme, and the third section repeats the consonantal patterns of the second. For example:

=== &quot;Cynghanedd lusg&quot; (&quot;drag-harmony&quot;) ===

The final syllable before the caesura in the first half of the line makes full rhyme with the penultimate syllable of the line-final polysyllabic word (i.e. the main stressed syllable of the second half). For example:

=== Other details ===

A comprehensive account of cynghanedd would run to many thousands of words: many sub-types and subtleties must be accounted for by a full description of the system.

==Internal rhyme in Breton==
A form of &quot;cynghanedd lusg&quot; known as &quot;internal rhyme&quot; (Breton : &quot;klotennoù diabarzh&quot;, &quot;enklotennoù&quot; or &quot;kenganez&quot;) was frequently used in Middle Breton, between the XIIth and XVIIth centuries, in poetry, like in &quot;Pemzec Leuenez Maria&quot; or in the sonnet from Français Moeam, and theatre like in lots of &quot;misterioù&quot;, religious pieces, such as Buhez Sante Barba&#x27;. Two of the oldest works with internal rhymes are the Ivonet Omnes verses, which seem to be an old Breton lay and &quot;Dialog etre Arzuz Roe d&#x27;an bretounet ha Guiclaff&quot;, a prophetic text in dialogues.

This is an extract of &quot;An Dialog etre Arzur Roe d&#x27;an Bretounet ha Guynglaff&quot; (48-49 verses) :
Though it isn&#x27;t as used as &quot;cynghanedd&quot; in Modern Welsh, some authors have published some work using this internal rhyme in poetry (Alan Botrel) or in the form of a lay like &quot;Lae Izold&quot; by Paskal Tabuteau.

* For an example of a poem in English using &quot;cynghanedd&quot;, see the poem by Katherine Bryant at the end of this page. Note, however, that the poem suffers from the usual awkwardness resulting from the attempt to force English into the Welsh patterns. The &quot;cynghanedd&quot; here is also either incomplete or faulty in lines 1,2,3,7,8,11,12,14.

<text>Brighten the Corners is the fourth studio album by American indie rock band Pavement, released on February 11, 1997 by Matador Records. The album received very positive reviews from critics.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; was recorded at Mitch Easter&#x27;s Drive-In Studio in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. According to singer and guitarist Stephen Malkmus, it was either Matador Records or Mary Timony from Helium who suggested that the band should record the album there.

Although &quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; was mostly produced by Pavement and Bryce Goggin, Easter worked with the band for roughly a week when Goggin left the studio. 

The recording sessions involved extensive editing, and the band would often record several versions of the same song before deciding on a final take. The vocals were then recorded in New York separately.

The album title was in reference to &quot;Brighten The Corner Where You Are&quot;, a gospel hymn written by Homer Rodeheaver in the early 1900s.

== Release ==
&quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; was released on February 11, 1997, by Matador Records. In 2008, Matador released &quot;Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition&quot;, a compilation containing &quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; in its entirety, as well as B-sides and other rarities from the same era.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; received very positive reviews from critics and was ranked No. 10 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1997 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. In the poll&#x27;s accompanying essay, Robert Christgau referred to the album as one of his &quot;favorite albums of the year, easy&quot;, alongside those by Yo La Tengo, Sleater-Kinney, and Arto Lindsay.

<doc id="839534" wikidata="Q1059604" url="?curid=839534" title="Terror Twilight">
<text>Terror Twilight is the fifth and final studio album by the American indie rock band Pavement. It was released on June 8, 1999, on Matador Records in the US and Domino Recording Company in the UK.

&quot;Terror Twilight&quot; was produced by Nigel Godrich, who hoped to create a &quot;straighter&quot; album and bring Pavement to a wider audience. He and the band disagreed over some choices, and the songwriter, Stephen Malkmus, later expressed dissatisfaction with the album. It received positive reviews. After finishing the tour for the album, Pavement disbanded. In 2022, Matador released an expanded reissue, &quot;Terror Twilight: Farewell Horizontal.&quot;

== Background and recording ==
&quot;Terror Twilight&quot; was produced by the British producer Nigel Godrich, who had gained fame for his work with Radiohead, Beck and R.E.M.. Godrich, a Pavement fan, accepted the job without having met the band or seen them perform. Hoping to help them find a bigger audience, he wanted to make an album that &quot;stood up straighter&quot; and would &quot;reach people who were turned off by the beautiful sloppiness of other Pavement records&quot;. According to the songwriter, Stephen Malkmus, Godrich asked no fee, asking only for royalties. However, Malkmus said: &quot;We paid for the studio time, of course, which started to get expensive. Because [Godrich] had his own, uh, standards.&quot;

The group began work in Sonic Youth&#x27;s studio in lower Manhattan, New York. Godrich found the studio limiting, so the group moved to RPM Studios near Washington Square Park, where Malkmus estimated three quarters of the album were recorded. Dominic Murcott of High Llamas played drums for two tracks when Steve West could not play in time. Malkmus also played drums on one track. Overdubbing and editing took place in London at RAK Studios and Godrich&#x27;s studio Shebang. The Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood added harmonica on &quot;Platform Blues&quot; and &quot;Billie&quot;. Godrich mixed the album at Mayfair Studios.

According to the percussionist, Bob Nastanovich, Godrich struggled with the band&#x27;s casual approach, and called for more takes than they were used to. Though Nastanovich said Godrich took on a &quot;substantial challenge&quot; and &quot;did a good job&quot;, he felt he only connected with Malkmus and disregarded the other band members. Nastanovich realized after several days that Godrich did not know his name. The band was also less familiar with the new material, as it was driven entirely by Malkmus. The guitarist Scott Kannberg was unhappy that Malkmus was not interested in working on songs Kannberg had written, and said &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; was the hardest Pavement record to make.

Deciding the track list created conflict, Godrich wanted to begin the record with &quot;Platform Blues&quot; and end with &quot;Spit on a Stranger&quot;. He felt it should open with a &quot;longer, more challenging song to set the tempo&quot;, similar to the 1997 Radiohead album &quot;OK Computer.&quot; However, the band wanted to open with an &quot;easier&quot; song. Malkmus recalled, &quot;Nigel was like, &#x27;I&#x27;m done with this. This is the wrong move. We made a stoner album and you&#x27;re going halfway.&#x27; He’s right probably.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
Many of the tracks were previewed at a pair of solo Malkmus shows in California on August 12–13, 1998. These included &quot;Ann Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Carrot Rope&quot;, &quot;Spit On A Stranger&quot;, &quot;Platform Blues&quot;, &quot;You Are The Light&quot;, &quot;Folk Jam&quot;, and two others that remain unreleased (&quot;Civilized Satanist,&quot; which used a Moby Grape sample, and &quot;Dot Days&quot;).

At these shows, Malkmus played electric guitar and sang along with home demo recordings of the songs. The style of the recordings was similar to those found on the compilation &quot;At Home With the Groovebox&quot; (&quot;Robyn Turns 26&quot; and &quot;Watch Out!&quot;), the B-sides of the &quot;Spit on a Stranger&quot; single (&quot;Rooftop Gambler&quot; and &quot;The Porpoise And The Hand Grenade&quot;), and the demo version of &quot;Major Leagues&quot; found on the &quot;Major Leagues&quot; EP.

&quot;The Hexx&quot; was a quieter, slowed-down version of a discordant jam that was played extensively on the Brighten The Corners tour. Pavement had recorded a faster, louder version during the &quot;Brighten The Corners&quot; sessions—in fact, at one point &quot;The Hexx&quot; was to have been the opening track on that album. This recording was edited, retitled &quot;...And Then&quot; and issued as the vinyl B-side to &quot;Spit on a Stranger&quot;. The original, full-length recording can be found on &quot;Brighten The Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition&quot;. The single edit also appears among eight bonus tracks on the vinyl incarnation of the &quot;Creedence&quot; edition.

The original cover art for &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; lists the final track, &quot;Carrot Rope,&quot; as &quot;...And Carrot Rope.&quot; This alternate song title was revived for the 2010 Record Store Day version of &quot;Quarantine the Past&quot;, even though the song was the fifth track on side one.

Initial UK copies of the album came with a bonus CD-ROM which contained the whole album with a brief track-by-track commentary; film of Stephen Malkmus writing this – and calling for the help of his fellow band members in doing so – can be seen on the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD. The disc also contained the videos for &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Shady Lane&quot; from their previous album &quot;Brighten the Corners&quot; and a home movie segment containing some footage also seen in the &quot;Slow Century&quot; DVD.

Nastanovich came up with the title, and said it described the period between dusk and sunset when most traffic accidents occur, as only half of drivers switch on their headlights. His original suggestion was &quot;Farewell Horizontal&quot;, but he dismissed this as &quot;there was no way I was going to be on the &quot;Farewell Horizontal&quot; tour for the next year&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Terror Twilight&quot; was Pavement&#x27;s final album before their breakup. Godrich later said he could &quot;sense it was the end&quot; during the recording, and that &quot;people had differences of opinion&quot;. Fans perceived the lines &quot;The damage is done / I am not having fun any more&quot; from &quot;Ann Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; as a veiled reference to the band&#x27;s end.

During the six-month world tour for &quot;Terror Twilight&quot;, relationships within the group frayed, especially between Malkmus and the other members. After their show at the 1999 Coachella Festival, Malkmus told his bandmates he did not want to continue. During the final concert of the tour, at Brixton Academy in London on November 20, 1999, Malkmus had a pair of handcuffs attached to his microphone stand and told the audience: &quot;These symbolize what it&#x27;s like being in a band all these years.&quot; About two weeks later, a spokesperson for their record label told &quot;NME&quot; that Pavement had &quot;retired for the foreseeable future&quot;.

In 2017, Malkmus described &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; as &quot;a real classic-rock overproduced $100,000 record. With that much money you should be able to make something good. We made some things that weren&#x27;t as good as they could&#x27;ve been.&quot; In response to the comments, Godrich tweeted: &quot;I literally slept on a friend&#x27;s floor in NYC to be able to make that album.&quot; In 2020, Godrich said that he loved the album and had enjoyed making it. He said: &quot;Maybe there were some internal politics, as there are in any band, but I made a friend forever in Stephen ... The writing may have been on the wall even before I got there, but I don&#x27;t think I had any part of that.&quot;

On April 8, 2022, Pavement released a special edition reissue, &quot;Terror Twilight: Farewell Horizontal&quot;, including 28 previously unreleased tracks. The vinyl set uses the track listing that Godrich suggested.

<text>Civilization Phaze III is the sixty-third album by Frank Zappa, released posthumously as a double album on October 31, 1994. It was the first studio album of new material from Zappa since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Jazz from Hell&quot;. The album marks the third part of a conceptual continuity that started with &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; (1968), with the second part being a re-edited version of Zappa&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;. Zappa described the album as a &quot;two-act opera&quot;, but in lieu of traditional recitatives and arias, it alternates brief spoken word passages with musical numbers created on a Synclavier using a combination of sampled and synthesized sounds. Much of the sampled material in the second half of the album was originally recorded by Ensemble Modern and other musicians to Zappa&#x27;s specifications.

The storyline of &quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot; involves a group of people living inside a piano, and the menacing reality of the outside world. The album&#x27;s themes include personal isolation and nationalism. Much of the album&#x27;s improvised dialogue was originally recorded as part of sessions which produced &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;, which contained some dialogue by the same speakers, and some of the dialogue on this album previously appeared on the re-edited version of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; released in 1968. New dialogue was recorded by Zappa in 1991, and includes similarly improvised dialogue by members of Ensemble Modern, Zappa&#x27;s daughter Moon Unit and actor Michael Rapaport.

== Background ==

In 1967, while recording &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; with the Mothers of Invention, Frank Zappa discovered that the strings of Apostolic Studios&#x27; grand piano would resonate if a person spoke near those strings. The &quot;piano people&quot; experiment involved Zappa having various speakers improvise dialogue using topics offered by Zappa. Various people contributed to these sessions, including Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Tim Buckley. The &quot;piano people&quot; voices primarily consisted of Mothers of Invention bandmembers Motorhead Sherwood and Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour (leader of the rock band Chrysalis), All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a &quot;psychotic turkey&quot;.

In 1992, Zappa recorded &quot;The Yellow Shark&quot; with the Ensemble Modern orchestra, and sampled their instrumentation with his Synclavier. After revisiting his archives, he decided to create an album which would combine the 1967 &quot;piano people&quot; dialogue, Synclavier music, performances by the Ensemble Modern, and newly recorded dialogue. The project began under the title &quot;Lumpy Gravy, Phase 3&quot; (with phase one being &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; and phase two being the 1968 version of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;), but was later changed to &quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot;.

Zappa recorded new dialogue segments to accompany the original &quot;piano people&quot; recordings. The new dialogue speakers included members of the Ensemble Modern, Moon Zappa, Dweezil Zappa and actor Michael Rapaport.

==Concept and music==
The album&#x27;s storyline was conceived via improvised dialogue involving a series of randomly chosen words, phrases and concepts, which included motors, pigs, ponies, dark water, nationalism, smoke, music, beer and personal isolation. The music was conceived as an opera pantomime, and is dark and ominous. The Ensemble Modern samples allowed the Synclavier to produce richer-sounding music than Zappa&#x27;s previous works using the machine, which produced the cruder-sounding music on albums such as &quot;Jazz from Hell&quot;. University of Washington music theory chair Jonathan W. Bernard suggests that &quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot; is heavily influenced by Zappa&#x27;s disenchantment with avant-garde composition and Zappa&#x27;s acute awareness of his own mortality. Bernard suggests that &quot;Civilization Phase III&quot; is Zappa&#x27;s last, greatest attempt at being recognized as a composer of &quot;serious music&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot; was the final album Frank Zappa completed before he died. It was published posthumously by Barking Pumpkin Records on October 31, 1994, solely as a mail order album, with no advertising or promotion; the album subsequently received a strong number of orders from Zappa&#x27;s fanbase. Rykodisc was given the option of distributing the album nationally, but the label ultimately did not distribute it.

The album was also not released with Zappa&#x27;s other works in the 2012 reissue of his catalog, but it can still be ordered from the artist&#x27;s official website. &quot;I think it&#x27;s very much about finishing his life,&quot; said his widow, Gail Zappa, in an interview. &quot;After he finished this, he said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve done everything that I can&#x27;&quot;.

== Reception ==

AllMusic reviewer François Couture wrote: &quot;It belongs to his corpus of &#x27;serious music&#x27;. [...] The original artwork and packaging are stunning and luxurious, a match for the music, some of the most compelling Zappa wrote outside of the rock realm.&quot; However, some critics felt that the &quot;piano people&quot; narrative did not hold up for a double album.
The album won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

<doc id="839543" wikidata="Q283526" url="?curid=839543" title="Wolbachia">
<text>Wolbachia is a genus of gram-negative bacteria infecting many species of arthropods and filarial nematodes. The symbiotic relationship ranges from parasitism to obligate mutualism. It is one of the most common parasitic microbes of arthropods, and is possibly the most widespread reproductive parasite bacterium in the biosphere. Its interactions with hosts are complex and highly diverse across different host species. Some host species cannot reproduce, or even survive, without &quot;Wolbachia&quot; colonisation. One study concluded that more than 16% of neotropical insect species carry bacteria of this genus, and as many as 25 to 70% of all insect species are estimated to be potential hosts.

==History==
The first organism classified as &quot;Wolbachia&quot; was discovered in 1924 by Marshall Hertig and Simeon Burt Wolbach in the common house mosquito. They described it as &quot;a somewhat pleomorphic, rodlike, Gram-negative, intracellular organism [that] apparently infects only the ovaries and testes&quot;. Hertig formally described the species in 1936, and proposed both the generic and specific names: &quot;Wolbachia pipientis&quot;.

Research on &quot;Wolbachia&quot; intensified after 1971, when Janice Yen and A. Ralph Barr of UCLA discovered that &quot;Culex&quot; mosquito eggs were killed by a cytoplasmic incompatibility when the sperm of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected males fertilized infection-free eggs.

Since, a large number of bacteria with close phylogenetic affinity to the originally detected &quot;W. pipientis&quot; have been discovered in a variety of hosts spanning over the Arthropoda and Nematoda phyla. The taxonomic classification of the various discovered groups remains a subject of debate, with no consensus on whether these groups of &quot;Wolbachia pipientis&quot;-like organisms should be categorized as the same or different species. Therefore, the strains are collectively referred to as &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, with the various groups of phylogenetically closely related strains designated as supergroups rather than distinct species. In general, each supergroup corresponds to a specific host or group of hosts. The genus &quot;Wolbachia&quot; is of considerable interest today due to its ubiquitous distribution, its many different evolutionary interactions, and its potential use as a biocontrol agent.

Phylogenetic studies have showed that the closest relatives to &quot;Wolbachia&quot; are the genera &quot;Francisella&quot; and &quot;Bartonella&quot;. Unlike &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, which needs a host cell to multiply, relatives belonging to these genera can be cultured on agar plates.

==Method of sexual differentiation in hosts==
&quot;Wolbachia&quot; can infect many different types of organs, but are most notable for the infections of the testes and ovaries of their hosts altering the reproduction abilities of these. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; species are ubiquitous in mature eggs, but not mature sperm. Only infected females, therefore, pass the infection on to their offspring. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria maximize their spread by altering the reproductive capabilities of their hosts, in favour for the infected females. Several different phenotypes have been observed, including:

* Male killing occurs when infected males die during larval development, which increases the rate of born, infected females.
* Feminization results in infected males that develop as females or infertile pseudofemales. This is especially prevalent in Lepidoptera species such as the adzuki bean borer (&quot;Ostrinia scapulalis&quot;).
* Parthenogenesis is reproduction of infected females without males. Some scientists have suggested that parthenogenesis may always be attributable to the effects of &quot;Wolbachia,&quot; though this is not the case for the marbled crayfish. An example of parthenogenesis induced by presence of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; are some species within the &quot;Trichogramma&quot; parasitoid wasp genus, which have evolved to procreate without males due to the presence of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;. Males are rare in this genus of wasp, possibly because many have been killed by that same strain of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;.
* Cytoplasmic incompatibility is the inability of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected males to successfully reproduce with uninfected females or females infected with another &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strain. This reduces the reproductive success of those uninfected females and therefore promotes the infecting strain. In the cytoplasmic incompatibility mechanism, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; interferes with the parental chromosomes during the first mitotic divisions to the extent that they can no longer divide in synchrony.

== Effects of sexual differentiation in hosts ==
Several host species, such as those within the genus &quot;Trichogramma&quot;, are so dependent on sexual differentiation of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; that they are unable to reproduce effectively without the bacteria in their bodies, and some might even be unable to survive uninfected.

One study on infected woodlice showed the broods of infected organisms had a higher proportion of females than their uninfected counterparts.

&quot;Wolbachia&quot;, especially &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-caused cytoplasmic incompatibility, may be important in promoting speciation. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains that distort the sex ratio may alter their host&#x27;s pattern of sexual selection in nature, and also engender strong selection to prevent their action, leading to some of the fastest examples of natural selection in natural populations.

The male killing and feminization effects of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infections can also lead to speciation in their hosts. For example, populations of the pill woodlouse, &quot;Armadillidium vulgare&quot; which are exposed to the feminizing effects of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, have been known to lose their female-determining chromosome. In these cases, only the presence of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can cause an individual to develop into a female. Cryptic species of ground wētā (&quot;Hemiandrus maculifrons&quot; complex) are host to different lineages of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; which might explain their speciation without ecological or geographical separation.

===Effect on aromatase===

The enzyme aromatase is found to mediate sex-change in many species of fish. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can affect the activity of aromatase in developing fish embryos.

==Mechanism of host transfer ==

=== Step 1: Physical transfer ===

==== Predator-prey interactions ====
&quot;Wolbachia&quot; may transfer from prey to predator through the digestive system. To do so, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; needs to first survive through the lumen secretion and then enter the host tissue through the gut epithelium. This route does not seem to occur frequently due to little evidence.

==== Host–parasitoid/parasite interactions ====
This may be one of the most common routes of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; host shifts. Compared to predator-prey interactions, the physical association between the host and parasites typically lasts longer, occurs at various developmental stages, and enables &quot;Wolbachia&quot; to directly contact various tissues.

Since this interaction may expose both sides to microbial exchange, one strategy for understanding the direction of transfer is to assess &quot;Wolbachia&quot;&#x27;s presence in close relatives on both sides, as the donor side generally has a larger diversity of infection.

One parasitoid species can infect multiple shared hosts, and one host species can infect multiple parasitoids. For instance, parthenogenesis-inducing &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can spread between &quot;Trichogramma&quot; parasitoid wasps sharing host eggs.

Parasites can also serve as a vector between infected and uninfected hosts without being infected. When the mouthparts and ovipositors of aphelinid parasitoid wasps become contaminated through feeding &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot;, it can infect the next host.

==== Shared plant and other food sources ====
This route applies to microbes that can survive either within or on the surface of the food. Experiments demonstrated that the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; wAlbB strain can survive extracellularly for up to 7 days, and up to 50 days for some strains in cotton leaf phloem vessels.

Plants are one of the best platforms for this route. By physical contact between arthropod mouthparts and plant tissue, the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; inhabiting the salivary glands of some insects may be transferred to the plants. As a result, arthropod species feeding on the same plants may share common &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains.

Other insect food sources may also mediate &quot;Wolbachia&quot; horizontal transfer, such as the sharing of dung patches between two Malagasy dung beetle species.

=== Step 2: Survival and proliferation in the new host ===
The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the bacteria, such as peptidoglycan, can activate the host&#x27;s innate immune responses. In response, some &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains have a unique functional peptidoglycan amidase (AmiDwol) that cleaves its bacterial cell wall so that it can escape from immune responses. Besides the peptidoglycans, cell-to-cell movements of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can also cause oxidative stress to the host and trigger the host&#x27;s immune response. Therefore, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; has a triple-layer vacuole that acts as a mechanical shield to protect it from cellular immune responses.

=== Step 3: Vertical transmission ===
Vertical transmission requires &quot;Wolbachia&quot; to reach germ line cells and maintain in the zygote. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; may initially occupy somatic stem cells as a stable reservoir and then use the host&#x27;s vitellogenin transovarial transportation system to enter the oocyte. Once &quot;Wolbachia&quot; enter the zygote, they need to reach important host tissues without disrupting the embryo&#x27;s development. This can be achieved using the host cytoskeleton, by bundling &quot;Wolbachia&quot; protein WD0830 to host actin filaments. They can also increase the division rate of germ-line stem cells to localize and increase their titer. Under natural conditions, successful vertical transmission of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; is challenging.

=== Step 4: Spread within the host population ===
Invasion of a new population likely stems from specific phenotypic effects, including reproductive manipulations and/or providing direct fitness benefits to their female hosts.

Upon transferring into a new host, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; may retain its original phenotypic effects, induce a different phenotype, or have no detectable effect. For instance, a strain that induces male killing in the moth &quot;Cadra cautella&quot; induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in a novel moth host &quot;Ephestia kuehniella&quot;.

==Fitness advantages by &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infections ==
&quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection has been linked to viral resistance in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, &quot;Drosophila simulans&quot;, and mosquito species. Flies, including mosquitoes, infected with the bacteria are more resistant to RNA viruses such as Drosophila C virus, norovirus, flock house virus, cricket paralysis virus, chikungunya virus, and West Nile virus.

In the common house mosquito, higher levels of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; were correlated with more insecticide resistance.

In leafminers of the species &quot;Phyllonorycter blancardella&quot;, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria help their hosts produce green islands on yellowing tree leaves, that is, small areas of leaf remaining fresh, allowing the hosts to continue feeding while growing to their adult forms. Larvae treated with tetracycline, which kills &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, lose this ability and subsequently only 13% emerge successfully as adult moths.

&quot;Muscidifurax uniraptor, a&quot; parasitoid wasp, also benefits from hosting &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria.

In the parasitic filarial nematode species responsible for elephantiasis, such as &quot;Brugia malayi&quot; and &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; has become an obligate endosymbiont and provides the host with chemicals necessary for its reproduction and survival. Elimination of the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; symbionts through antibiotic treatment therefore prevents reproduction of the nematode, and eventually results in its premature death.

Some &quot;Wolbachia&quot; species that infect arthropods also provide some metabolic provisioning to their hosts. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; is found to mediate iron metabolism under nutritional stress and in &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot;, the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strain &quot;cCle&quot; helps the host to synthesize B vitamins.

Some &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains have increased their prevalence by increasing their hosts&#x27; fecundity. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains captured from 1988 in southern California still induce a fecundity deficit, but nowadays the fecundity deficit has been replaced in the wild with a fecundity advantage such that infected &quot;Drosophila simulans&quot; produces more offspring than the uninfected ones.

==Life-history consequences of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection ==
&quot;Wolbachia&quot; often manipulates host reproduction and life-history in a way that favours its own propagation. In the Pharaoh ant, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection correlates with increased colony-level production of reproductives (i.e., greater reproductive investment), and earlier onset of reproductive production (i.e., shorter life-cycle). Infected colonies also seem to grow more rapidly. There is substantial evidence that the presence of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; that induce parthenogenesis have put pressure on species to reproduce primarily or entirely this way.

Additionally, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; has been seen to decrease the lifespan of &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, carriers of mosquito-borne diseases, and it decreases their efficacy of pathogen transmission because older mosquitoes are more likely to have become carriers of one of those diseases. This has been exploited as a method for pest control.

==Genomics==
The first &quot;Wolbachia&quot; genome to be determined was that of strain wMel, which infects &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; fruit flies. This genome was sequenced at The Institute for Genomic Research in a collaboration between Jonathan Eisen and Scott O&#x27;Neill. The second &quot;Wolbachia&quot; genome to be determined was of strain wBm, which infects &quot;Brugia malayi&quot; nematodes . Since the development and release of high-throughput sequencing technologies in the mid-2000s, the number of published &quot;Wolbachia&quot; genomes has grown significantly, driven by both the decreased cost of sequencing and the expanding interest in studying this bacterium.

The genetic background to the reproductive parasitism has been extensively studied in different host systems. A key factor for the alteration of host reproduction is the presence of the bacteriophage WO, which harbours the CI inducing genes &quot;cifA&quot; and &quot;cifB,&quot; contributing to the phenotypic expression of altered reproductive success observed in infected hosts. 
=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
Comparative sequence analyses of bacteriophage WO offer some of the most compelling examples of large-scale horizontal gene transfer between &quot;Wolbachia&quot; coinfections in the same host. It is the first bacteriophage implicated in frequent lateral transfer between the genomes of bacterial endosymbionts. Gene transfer by bacteriophages could drive significant evolutionary change in the genomes of intracellular bacteria that were previously considered highly stable or prone to loss of genes over time.

&quot;Wolbachia&quot; also transfers genes to the host. A nearly complete copy of the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; genome sequence was found within the genome sequence of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila ananassae&quot; and large segments were found in seven other &quot;Drosophila&quot; species.

In an application of DNA barcoding to the identification of species of &quot;Protocalliphora&quot; flies, several distinct morphospecies had identical cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequences, most likely through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) by &quot;Wolbachia&quot; species as they jump across host species. As a result, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can cause misleading results in molecular cladistical analyses. It is estimated that between 20 and 50 percent of insect species have evidence of HGT from &quot;Wolbachia&quot;—passing from microbes to animal (i.e. insects).

== Small RNA ==
The small non-coding RNAs WsnRNA-46 and WsnRNA-59 in &quot;Wolbachia&quot; were detected in &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquitoes and &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. The small RNAs (sRNAs) may regulate bacterial and host genes. Highly conserved intragenic region sRNA called ncrwmel02 was also identified in &quot;Wolbachia pipientis.&quot; It is expressed in four different strains in a regulated pattern that differs according to the sex of the host and the tissue localisation. This suggested that the sRNA may play important roles in the biology of &quot;Wolbachia.&quot;

==Relation to human-related infections==

===Role in parasites===
Outside of insects, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infects a variety of isopod species, spiders, mites, and many species of filarial nematodes (a type of parasitic worm), including those causing onchocerciasis (river blindness) and elephantiasis in humans, as well as heartworms in dogs. Not only are these disease-causing filarial worms infected with &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, but &quot;Wolbachia&quot; also seems to play an inordinate role in these diseases.

A large part of the pathogenicity of filarial nematodes is due to host immune response toward their &quot;Wolbachia&quot;. Elimination of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; from filarial nematodes generally results in either death or sterility of the nematode. Consequently, current strategies for control of filarial nematode diseases include elimination of their symbiotic &quot;Wolbachia&quot; via the simple doxycycline antibiotic, rather than directly killing the nematode with often more toxic antinematode medications.

=== Disease prevention ===

Naturally existing strains of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; have been shown to be a route for vector control strategies because of their presence in arthropod populations, such as mosquitoes. Due to the unique traits of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; that cause cytoplasmic incompatibility, some strains are useful to humans as a promoter of genetic drive within an insect population. &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected females are able to produce offspring with uninfected and infected males; however, uninfected females are only able to produce viable offspring with uninfected males. This gives infected females a reproductive advantage that is greater the higher the frequency of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; in the population. Computational models predict that introducing &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains into natural populations will reduce pathogen transmission and reduce overall disease burden. An example includes a life-shortening &quot;Wolbachia&quot; that can be used to control dengue virus and malaria by eliminating the older insects that contain more parasites. Promoting the survival and reproduction of younger insects lessens selection pressure for evolution of resistance.

In addition, some &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strains are able to directly reduce viral replication inside the insect. For dengue they include wAllbB and wMelPop with &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, wMel with &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot; and &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;.

&quot;Wolbachia&quot; has also been identified to inhibit replication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in &quot;A. aegypti&quot;. The &quot;w&quot;Mel strain of &quot;Wolbachia pipientis&quot; significantly reduced infection and dissemination rates of CHIKV in mosquitoes, compared to &quot;Wolbachia&quot; uninfected controls and the same phenomenon was observed in yellow fever virus infection converting this bacterium in an excellent promise for YFV and CHIKV suppression.

&quot;Wolbachia&quot; also inhibits the secretion of West Nile virus (WNV) in cell line Aag2 derived from &quot;A. aegypti&quot; cells. The mechanism is somewhat novel, as the bacteria actually enhances the production of viral genomic RNA in the cell line &quot;Wolbachia&quot;. Also, the antiviral effect in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes depends on the strain of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, and the replication of the virus in orally fed mosquitoes was completely inhibited in wMelPop strain of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;.

The effect of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection on virus replication in insect hosts is complex and depends on the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strain and virus species. While several studies have indicated consistent refractory phenotypes of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection on positive-sense RNA viruses in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the yellow fever mosquito &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; and the Asian tiger mosquito &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot;, this effect is not seen in DNA virus infection and in some cases &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection has been associated or shown to increase single stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA virus infection. There is also currently no evidence that &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection restricts any tested negative-sense RNA viruses indicating &quot;Wolbachia&quot; would be unsuitable for restriction of negative-sense RNA arthropod borne viruses.

&quot;Wolbachia&quot; infection can also increase mosquito resistance to malaria, as shown in &quot;Anopheles stephensi&quot; where the &quot;w&quot;AlbB strain of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; hindered the lifecycle of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;.

However, &quot;Wolbachia&quot; infections can also enhance pathogen transmission. &quot;Wolbachia&quot; has enhanced multiple arboviruses in &quot;Culex tarsalis&quot; mosquitoes. In another study, West Nile virus (WNV) infection rate was significantly higher in &quot;Wolbachia&quot; (strain wAlbB)-infected &quot;C. tarsalis&quot; compared to controls.

&quot;Wolbachia&quot; may induce reactive oxygen species–dependent activation of the Toll (gene family) pathway, which is essential for activation of antimicrobial peptides, defensins, and cecropins that help to inhibit virus proliferation. Conversely, certain strains actually dampen the pathway, leading to higher replication of viruses. One example is with strain wAlbB in &quot;Culex tarsalis&quot;, where infected mosquitoes actually carried the West Nile virus (WNV) more frequently. This is because wAlbB inhibits REL1, an activator of the antiviral Toll immune pathway. As a result, careful studies of the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strain and ecological consequences must be done before releasing artificially-infected mosquitoes in the environment.

==== Techniques and deployments ====

===== Strain wMel, mixed-sex =====
The World Mosquito Program (WMP) uses &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strain wMel to infect &quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitos. The mixed-sex mosquitos are intended to infect the local population with wMel, giving them transmission resistance.

In 2014, WMP released infected mosquitos in Townsville, an Australia city with 187,000 inhabitants plagued by dengue. For four years after introduction, no cases of dengue were reported. Trials in much smaller areas had been carried out, but a larger area had not been tested. No environmental ill-effects were reported. The cost was A$15 per inhabitant, but it was hoped that it could be reduced to US$1 in poorer countries with lower labor costs.

In 2016, WMP scientist Scott Ritchie proposed using wMel mosquitos to combat the spread of the Zika virus. A study reported that &quot;Wolbachia&quot; wMel has the ability to block Zika in Brazil. In October 2016, it was announced that US$18 million in funding was being allocated for the use of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected mosquitoes to fight Zika and dengue viruses. Deployment was slated for early 2017 in Colombia and Brazil.

Between 2016 and 2020, WMP conducted its first randomized controlled trial in Yogyakarta, an Indonesian city of about 400,000 inhabitants. In August 2020, the trial&#x27;s Indonesian lead scientist Adi Utarini announced that the trial showed a 77% reduction in dengue cases compared to the control areas. This trial was the &quot;strongest evidence yet&quot; for the technique.

In 2017–2019, WMP released mosquitos in Niterói, Brazil.

In March 2023, Brazil&#x27;s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation signed an agreement with WMP to provide funds for a large &quot;mosquito factory&quot; producing infected insects.

===== Male incompatibility =====
Another method to use &quot;Wolbachia&quot; in mosquitos exploits the cytoplamic incompatibility between infected males and uninfected females. If an uninfected female mates with an infected male, her eggs become infertile. With enough infected males released, the mosquito population would be reduced temporarily.

Verily, the life sciences arm of Google&#x27;s parent company Alphabet Inc., uses this method. In July 2017, it announced a plan to release about 20 million &quot;Wolbachia&quot;-infected male &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquitoes in Fresno, California, in an attempt to combat the Zika virus. Singapore&#x27;s National Environment Agency has teamed up with Verily to come up with an advanced, more efficient way to release male &quot;Wolbachia&quot; mosquitoes for Phase 2 of its study to suppress the urban &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquito population and fight dengue.

On November 3, 2017, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered Mosquito Mate, Inc. to release &quot;Wolbachia&quot; strain &quot;ZAP&quot;-infected male mosquitoes in 20 US states and the District of Columbia.

<text>Young Mr. Lincoln is a 1939 American biographical drama western film about the early life of President Abraham Lincoln, directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda. Ford and producer Darryl F. Zanuck fought for control of the film, to the point where Ford destroyed unwanted takes for fear the studio would use them in the film. Screenwriter Lamar Trotti was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing/Original Story.

In 2003, &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1832, a family traveling through New Salem, Illinois in their wagon need groceries from Lincoln&#x27;s store, and the only thing of value that they have to trade is a barrel of old books including a law book, &quot;Blackstone&#x27;s Commentaries&quot;. After thoroughly reading the book, Lincoln opts for the law after receiving encouragement from his early, ill-fated love, Ann Rutledge, who soon dies. Too poor to own even a horse, he arrives in Springfield, Illinois, on a mule and soon establishes a law practice in 1837 with his friend, John Stuart. After a raucous, day-long Independence Day celebration, a man, Skrub White, is killed after he pulled a gun in a fight. The accused are two brothers, Matt and Adam Clay. Lincoln prevents the lynching of the accused at the jail by shaming the angry, drunken mob. He also convinces it that he really needs the clients for his first real case.

Admiring his courage, Mary Todd invites Lincoln to her sister&#x27;s soiree. Despite being aggressively courted by the very polished Stephen Douglas, Mary is interested in Lincoln. She faithfully attends the trial of the Clay boys, sits in the front row, and listens closely.

The boys&#x27; mother, Abigail Clay, who witnessed the end of the fight, and Lincoln are pressured by the prosecutor to save one of the brothers at the expense of the other&#x27;s conviction. However, the key witness to the crime, J. Palmer Cass, is a friend of the victim who claims to have seen the murder at a distance of about 100 yards (91.4 meters) under the light of the moon: &quot;It was moon bright&quot;. However, Lincoln persists and is able, by using an almanac, to demonstrate that on the night in question, the moon had set before the time of death. He then drives Cass to confess that he had actually stabbed his friend.

==Background==
The film has as its basis the murder case against William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong, which took place in 1858 at the courthouse in Beardstown, Illinois, the only courthouse in which Lincoln practiced law that is still in use. Lincoln proved the witness against the accused was lying about being able to see by the light of the Moon, using an almanac. Armstrong was acquitted.

==Critical reception==
In a favorable review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Nugent wrote that the film&#x27;s tableaux of scenes and characters gave the film &quot;the right to be called Americana,&quot; and praised Fonda&#x27;s performance:Henry Fonda&#x27;s characterization is one of those once-in-a-blue-moon things: a crossroads meeting of nature, art and a smart casting director. Nature gave Mr. Fonda long legs and arms, a strong and honest face and a slow smile; the make-up man added a new nose bridge... [Fonda&#x27;s] performance kindles the film, makes it a moving unity, at once gentle and quizzically comic.In an essay that not only discusses the film, but also sheds light on the Soviet view of Lincoln&#x27;s career and mythos, Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein named &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; as the one American film that he most wishes he had made, lauding its &quot;harmony,&quot; the &quot;stylized daguerrotype manner&quot; of its photography, and the sympathy and subtlety with which it portrays Lincoln, whom Eisenstein likens to Russian folk hero Ilya Muromets.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; was adapted as a radio play on the July 10, 1946, episode of &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;.

The Village Theatre of Everett and Issaquah, Washington has commissioned a new musical based on the film titled &quot;Lincoln in Love&quot;, book and lyrics by Peter S. Kellogg and music by David Friedman.

<text>Coloratura ( , , ; , from Latin &quot;colorare&quot; &#x27;to color&#x27;) is an elaborate melody with runs, trills, wide leaps, or similar virtuoso-like material, or a passage of such music. Operatic roles in which such music plays a prominent part, and singers of these roles, are also called coloratura. Its instrumental equivalent is ornamentation. Coloratura is particularly found in vocal music and especially in operatic singing of the 18th and 19th centuries.

== History ==

The term &quot;coloratura&quot; was first defined in several early non-Italian music dictionaries: Michael Praetorius&#x27;s &quot;Syntagma musicum&quot; (1618); Sébastien de Brossard&#x27;s &quot;Dictionaire de musique&quot; (1703); and Johann Gottfried Walther&#x27;s &quot;Musicalisches Lexicon&quot; (1732). In these early texts &quot;the term is dealt with briefly and always with reference to Italian usage&quot;.

Christoph Bernhard (1628–1692) defined &quot;coloratura&quot; in two ways:

* cadenza: &quot;runs which are not so exactly bound to the bar, but which often extend two, three or more bars further [and] should be made only at chief closes&quot; (&quot;Von der Singe-Kunst, oder Maniera&quot;, c. 1649)
* diminution: &quot;when an interval is altered through several shorter notes, so that, instead of one long note, a number of shorter ones rush to the next note through all kinds of progressions by step or leap&quot; (&quot;Tractatus compositionis&quot;, c. 1657)

The term was never used in the most famous Italian texts on singing: Giulio Caccini&#x27;s &quot;Le Nuove musiche&quot; (1601/2); Pier Francesco Tosi&#x27;s, &quot;Opinioni de&#x27; cantori antichi e moderni&quot; (1723); Giovanni Battista Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Pensieri, e riflessioni pratiche sopra il canto figurato&quot; (1774); Manuel García&#x27;s &quot;Mémoire sur la voix humaine&quot; (1841), and &quot;Traité complet de l’art du chant&quot; (1840–47); nor was it used by the English authors Charles Burney (1726–1814) and Henry Fothergill Chorley (1808–1872), both of whom wrote at length about Italian singing of a period when ornamentation was essential.

== Modern usage ==
The term &quot;coloratura&quot; is most commonly applied to the elaborate and florid figuration or ornamentation in classical (late 18th century) and romantic (19th century, specifically &quot;bel canto&quot;) vocal music. However, early music of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, and in particular, baroque music extending up to about 1750, includes a substantial body of music for which coloratura technique is required by vocalists and instrumentalists alike. In the modern musicological sense the term is therefore used to refer to florid music from all periods of music history, both vocal and instrumental. For example, in Germany the term &quot;coloratura&quot; () has been applied to the stereotypical and formulaic ornamentation used in 16th‑century keyboard music written by a group of German organ composers referred to as the &quot;colorists&quot; ().

Despite its derivation from Latin &quot;colorare&quot; (&quot;to color&quot;), the term does not apply to the practice of &quot;coloring&quot; the voice, &quot;i.e.&quot; altering the quality or timbre of the voice for expressive purposes (for example, the technique of &quot;voix sombrée&quot; used by Gilbert Duprez in the 1830s).

=== Vocal ranges ===
The term is not restricted to describing any one range of voice. All female and male voice types may achieve mastery of coloratura technique. There are coloratura parts for all voice types in different musical genres.

Nevertheless, the term &quot;coloratura&quot;, when used without further qualification, normally means a coloratura soprano. This role, most famously typified by the Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, has a high range and requires the singer to execute with great facility elaborate ornamentation and embellishment, including running passages, staccati, and trills. A coloratura soprano has the vocal ability to produce notes above high C (C6) and possesses a tessitura ranging from A4 to A5 or higher (unlike lower sopranos whose tessitura is G4–G5 or lower).
Richard Miller names two types of soprano coloratura voices (the coloratura and the dramatic coloratura) as well as a mezzo-soprano coloratura voice, and although he does not mention the coloratura contralto, he includes mention of specific works requiring coloratura technique for the contralto voice.

Examples of coloratura music for different voice ranges include:

* Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Allelujah&quot; (from &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot;) may be arranged for and sung by a properly trained contralto, mezzo-soprano or soprano. The piece was written for soprano castrato.
* The aria &quot;Every valley shall be exalted&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; is an example of a coloratura piece for tenor.
* Each singer of a major role in Rossini&#x27;s operas must have a secure coloratura technique.
* Osmin, a character in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;, is a coloratura role for a basso.
* &quot;Agitata da due venti&quot; (&quot;Agitated by two winds&quot;) a coloratura soprano aria, from Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s opera &quot;Griselda&quot;.
* &quot;Naqui All&#x27;Affanno - Non Piu Mesta&quot; a coloratura contralto rondo, from Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;.

<text>The  (, meaning &#x27;Afrikaner Resistance Movement&#x27;), commonly known by its abbreviation AWB (), is a Afrikaner nationalist, white supremacist, and neo-Nazi political party in South Africa. Founded in 1973 by Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche and six other far-right Afrikaners, the AWB advocates for secessionist Afrikaner nationalism and the establishment of an independent Boer-Afrikaner republic, referred to as the &quot;&quot;Volkstaat&quot; or &quot;Boerestaat&quot;,&quot; within part of South Africa.

During the negotiations to end apartheid in the early 1990s, the organization committed acts of terror and violence against black South Africans. As of 2016, the AWB reportedly had approximately 5,000 members and utilized social media platforms for recruitment.

==History==
On 7 July 1973, Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche, a former police officer, called a meeting of several men in Heidelberg, Gauteng, in the then-Transvaal Province of South Africa. He was disillusioned by what he thought were Prime Minister B. J. Vorster&#x27;s &quot;liberal views&quot; of racial issues in the White minority country, after a period in which Black majorities had ascended to power in many former colonies. Terre&#x27;Blanche also worried about what he characterised as communist influences in South African society. He decided to form a group with six other like-minded persons, which they named the (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) (AWB), to promote Afrikaner and Christian nationalism. His associates elected him as head of the group, a position he held until he was murdered on his farm in April 2010.

Their objective was to establish an independent &quot;Boerestaat&quot; (&quot;Boer State&quot;) for Boer-Afrikaner people only. It was to be independent of apartheid South Africa, which they considered too left-wing and liberal. The AWB was formed to try to regain the ground they thought lost after the Second Boer War; the men intended to re-establish the independent Boer Republics of the past: the South African Republic (&quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot;) and the Republic of the Orange Free State (&quot;Oranje Vrystaat&quot;). The organization was strongly antisemitic and advocated for the extermination of South Africa&#x27;s Jewish population.

===Apartheid era===

During the 1970s and 1980s, the AWB attracted several thousand White South Africans as members. They opposed the reform of apartheid laws during the 1980s, harassing liberal politicians and holding large (and often quite rowdy) political rallies. Terre&#x27;Blanche used his flamboyant oratorial skills and forceful personality to win converts. He railed against the lifting of many so-called &quot;petty apartheid&quot; laws, such as the law banning interracial sex and marriage (the Race Relations Act), mixing of the races (Group Areas Act), as well as the government providing limited political rights to Indians and Coloureds (mixed-race individuals). During the State of Emergency (1984–86), AWB violence and murders of unarmed non-Whites were reported. The AWB especially opposed the then-illegal African National Congress (ANC). The ruling National Party considered the AWB to be a fringe group.

The group operated relatively unhindered until 1986, when white South African Police (SAP) officers took the unprecedented step of using lachrymatory agent or tear gas against the AWB when they disrupted a National Party rally. In 1988, the organisation was estimated to have had support amongst 5–7% of the White South African population. In the Nick Broomfield documentary film, &quot;His Big White Self&quot; (2006), he claimed the organisation reached a peak of half a million supporters in its heyday.

===During the end of apartheid===

During the negotiations that led to South Africa&#x27;s first non-racial election, the AWB engaged in violence and murder. 
During the Battle of Ventersdorp in August 1991, the AWB confronted police in front of the town hall where State President F. W. de Klerk was speaking, and &quot;a number of people were killed or injured&quot; in the conflict. Later in the negotiations, the AWB stormed the Kempton Park World Trade Centre where the negotiations were taking place, breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car. The police guarding the centre failed to prevent the invasion. The invaders then took over the main conference hall, threatening delegates and painting slogans on the walls, but left again after a short period. Six AWB members were sentenced to death for the murder of four black people at a fake roadblock they set up to terrorise black travellers. On 4 July 1990, members of the AWB detonated an explosive against the Vrye Weekblad newspaper, which they had accused of having a &quot;liberal bias&quot;. This was the most serious attack in a string of explosive attacks. It was not until 20 March of the following year that a series of attacks hit the city of Ventersdorp, leaving only material damage.

In 1988, the AWB was beset by scandal when claims that Terre&#x27;Blanche had had an affair with journalist Jani Allan surfaced. In July 1989, Cornelius Lottering, a member of a breakaway AWB group Orde van die Dood (Order of Death), attempted to assassinate Allan by placing a bomb outside her Sandton apartment. Nick Broomfield&#x27;s 1991 documentary &quot;The Leader, His Driver and the Driver&#x27;s Wife&quot; claimed that Terre&#x27;Blanche had sex with Allan, a claim she denied. This led to Allan taking libel proceedings against the documentary broadcaster Channel 4 in 1992 at the London High Court. During the trial, several transcripts of their alleged unconventional sexual positions appeared in the South African and British press. Terre&#x27;Blanche also submitted a sworn statement to the London court denying that he had had an affair with Allan. Although the judge found that Channel 4&#x27;s allegations had not defamed Allan, he did not rule on whether or not there had been an affair. In November 1993, the AWB signed a solidarity pact with the Inkatha Freedom Party, with the AWB providing the IFP with military training and agreeing that &quot;Boer and Zulu would fight together for freedom and land should they be confronted by a common enemy&quot;.

Between 24 and 27 April 1994, AWB members committed a series of four bombings in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Germiston in an attempt to disrupt the multi-racial elections. A total of 20 people were killed and 46 were injured. In the aftermath of the election, 36 AWB members were arrested in connection with the bombings. Nine men were convicted on charges relating to the bombing in 1996. In 1999, amnesty was granted to ten men tied to the bombings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

On 28 April 1994, members of the AWB beat up African-American reporter Michael Allen of The New York Times while covering an AWB mobilization in Rustenburg. Despite the fact that the reporter was punched and kicked by several members of the AWB, his injuries were not serious.

===Bophuthatswana crisis===

In 1994, before the advent of majority rule, the AWB gained international notoriety in its attempt to defend the dictatorial government of Lucas Mangope in the homeland of Bophuthatswana. The AWB, along with a contingent of about 90 Afrikaner Volksfront militiamen, entered the capital Mmabatho on 10 and 11 March. The black policemen and soldiers of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force who were out in force to support President Mangope disappeared from the streets in protest at the AWB&#x27;s actions and later turned on the militiamen at the airport at Mafikeng. One AWB member was shot and killed when the convoy attempted to leave the airport and continue to Mmabatho. When in Mmabatho, the AWB and the Afrikaner Volksfront found themselves under continuous siege from both the Bophuthatswana Defence Force and Mmabatho citizens. When attempting to retreat from Mmabatho on 11 March, three AWB members were summarily killed after they had been wounded in a firefight, by a rogue Bophuthatswana Defence Force member who defected to the ANC. Nearby photojournalists and television news crews recorded the incident, which proved to be a public relations disaster for the AWB, demoralising its White members. The AWB claimed that they were asked into the country and only entered trying to help the Bophuthatswana Government, but the Tebbutt Commission found the &quot;evidence is overwhelming that they entered the area uninvited and that they were not welcome there&quot;.

===Post-apartheid===
On 24 December 1996, members of the AWB planted two explosive devices at a Shoprite supermarket in Worcester, Western Cape, killing four civilians and wounding 60 more approximately. Only two of the four bombs that had been installed detonated. Despite this the explosion killed four civilians, including three children. It was not until September 2013 when the victims and the perpetrators of the attack spoke, thanks to an initiative of the Victim-Aggressor Dialogue Program.

On 17 June 2001, Terre&#x27;Blanche was sentenced to six years in prison for assaulting a petrol station employee, John Ndzima, to such an extent as to cause permanent brain damage, and the attempted murder of a security guard and former employee, Paul Motshabi. Terre&#x27;Blanche was released in June 2004 after serving three years in Rooigrond Prison near Mafikeng. During his time in prison, he became a born-again Christian and claimed he had moderated many of his more ethno-nationalist views and preached reconciliation as &#x27;prescribed by God&#x27;.

In April 2007, AWB posters appeared at the 13th Klein Karoo National Arts Festival in Oudtshoorn. Several posters made reference to the Bok van Blerk song &quot;De la Rey&quot;, an Afrikaans hit record about the Boer General as well as to South Africa&#x27;s former Coat of Arms. Organisers were quick to remove the posters.

In March 2008, the AWB announced it was re-activating for &#x27;populist&#x27; reasons, citing the encouragement of the public. Reasons for their return include: the electricity crisis, corruption across government departments and rampant crime. Plans include a demand for land that they claim is legally theirs in terms of the Sand River Convention of 1852 and other historical treaties, through the International Court of Justice in The Hague if necessary, and if that failed, taking up arms. In April 2008, Terre&#x27;Blanche was to be the speaker at several AWB rallies in Vryburg, Middelburg and Pretoria. Several areas in South Africa have been earmarked as part of a future Volkstaat according to three critical title deeds. The areas include Vryheid in KwaZulu-Natal, the old Republics of Stellaland and Goshen in the far North-West and sections of the Free State.

The &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2008 reported that the AWB group had over 5,000 members, and appealed to 18- to 35-year-olds to join the organisation&#x27;s youth wing. The South African press reported in 2016 that the AWB continued to use social media to recruit new members.

In 2010, Terre&#x27;Blanche was murdered by an employee on his farm, and Steyn von Rönge was announced as the new leader of the organisation.

==Leader==
==Logo==

The AWB flag is composed of three black sevens forming a triskelion in a white circle upon a red background, similar to the flag of Nazi Germany. According to AWB, the sevens, &#x27;the number of final victory&#x27;, &#x27;stand to oppose the number 666, the number of the anti-Christ&#x27;. Red is considered to represent Jesus&#x27; blood and the struggle of the Christians, while black stands for bravery. The inner white circle symbolises &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;eternal life&quot;, paralleling the common symbolism of a halo.

The AWB also uses the &quot;Vierkleur&quot;, the original flag of the once independent South African Republic, the flag of the Orange Free State, and a custom variant of the old flag of South Africa with the British flag replaced.

==In fiction==
The organisation is a popular antagonist amongst writers of alternate history literature. Several members of a fictionalised AWB are important characters in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s American Civil War alternate history novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; (1992). The AWB also features prominently in Larry Bond&#x27;s novel of a Cold War-era civil war/international conflict in South Africa, &quot;Vortex&quot; (1991). It also appears in Richard Herman Jr.&#x27;s novel, &quot;Iron Gate&quot; (1996).

<text>Gríðr (Old Norse: ; or Gríd) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. She is the mother of Víðarr the silent and the consort of Odin. Saturn&#x27;s moon Gridr was named after her.

== Name ==
The poetic Old Norse name &quot;Gríðr&quot; has been translated as &quot;vehemence, violence, or impetuosity&quot;. Its etymology is unclear.

== Attestations ==

=== Prose Edda ===
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry), Gríðr is portrayed as equipping the thunder god Thor with her belt of strength, her iron glove, and her staff &quot;Gríðarvöl&quot; (Gríðr&#x27;s-staff) on Thor&#x27;s journey to the abode of Geirröðr.

 Gríðr is also mentioned in a list of troll-wives (&quot;I shall list the names of troll-wives. Grid and Gnissa, Gryla...&quot;).

=== Skaldic poetry ===
&quot;Gríðarvöl&quot; (Gríðr&#x27;s staff) is also mentioned in the poem &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; by the late-10th-century skald Eilífr Goðrúnarson.
Gríðr appears in 10th-century kennings for &#x27;wolf&#x27; (the steed of troll-wife) and for &#x27;axe&#x27; (that which is dangerous to the life-protector, i.e. shield or helmet).

=== Other texts ===
Saxo Grammaticus refers to her as &quot;Grytha&quot;, the wife of the legendary king Dan I of Denmark, &quot;a lady whom the Teutons accorded the highest honour&quot;. A witch of the same name appears in &quot;Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra&quot;.
== Theory ==
Her role as the donor of information and necessary items to the hero has been analyzed by folklorists as a commonplace of folk narrative.

==Notes==
==References==

<text>Lorne is a town in Surf Coast Shire, Victoria, Australia. It is situated on the Louttit Bay and Erskine River and is a popular destination on the Great Ocean Road. At the had a population of 1,114.

== History ==
Prior to British settlement, Lorne was part of the traditional lands of the Gadubanud or King Parrot people of the Cape Otway coast according to Ian Clark,

Lorne is situated on a bay named after Captain Louttit, who sought shelter there in 1841 while supervising the retrieval of cargo from a nearby shipwreck. The coast was surveyed five years later in 1846. The first European settler was William Lindsay, a timber-cutter who began felling the area in 1849. The first telegraph arrived in 1859. Subdivision began in 1869 and in 1871 the town was named after the Marquess of Lorne from Argyleshire in Scotland on the occasion of his marriage to Princess Louise, one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters. The Post Office opened on 29 April 1874.

In 1891, the area was visited by Rudyard Kipling, who was inspired to write the poem &quot;Flowers&quot;, which includes the lines:

By 1922, the Great Ocean Road was extended to Lorne, making the town much more accessible. The first passenger road service to Geelong was established in 1924 and guesthouses began to appear after 1930.

Lorne Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 October 1984.

== Tourism ==

Popular local activities include traditional beach pursuits such as family bathing and surfing, as well as pier fishing for barracuda, whiting, and trevally. Teddy&#x27;s Lookout lies at the end of George Street on the town&#x27;s southern outskirts and offers fine views over the town, coastline, and Great Ocean Road. The Great Otway National Park is nearby; the Erskine River, which rises in the park and contains the Erskine Falls, has its mouth at Lorne.

The town&#x27;s population swells to around 13,000 each New Year&#x27;s Eve when the Falls Festival takes place. During the first weekend of January over 20,000 spectators visit Lorne when the town hosts the 1.2 km Pier to Pub swim (described in the Guinness Book of Records as &quot;the largest organised ocean swim in the world&quot; and currently capped at 4,000 competitors), the 8 km Mountain to Surf run, and the Lorne Surf Boat Race. Terminating in Lorne on the Queen&#x27;s Birthday was the Great Otway Classic Foot Race (no longer held). Fair on the Foreshore occurs on the first weekend in November.

The town has two pubs (The Grand Pacific Hotel and Lorne Hotel) and a number of cafes, restaurants, and bakeries, mostly located along Mountjoy Parade. As usual in a tourist town, there is a large number of boutiques and clothing stores, as well as a book store, art galleries, and craft shops. 
Lorne has the Great Ocean Road Museum, which describes the history of the road. Things to do in Lorne include strolling along the Great Ocean Road, visiting the Lorne Pier, surfing or exploring the Otway Ranges National Park. There are also many art galleries and cultural events to enjoy.

==Sport==
The town is home to the Lorne Football Netball Club, which competes in both Australian Rules football and netball in the Colac &amp; District Football Netball League.

Golf and tennis are played at the Lorne Country Club on Holliday Road.

== Education ==
Lorne has one school, Lorne P-12 College, that facilitates both primary and secondary education.

==Media==
Lorne has a local magazine, Lorne Independent, published monthly. The local newspaper sold in Lorne is the Geelong Advertiser, published daily except Sundays. 

Five free-to-air television networks, Seven, WIN, Network 10, ABC TV and SBS, all broadcast a service to Lorne. Unlike Anglesea/Aireys Inlet, the Ballarat channels are being broadcast into Lorne instead of the Melbourne channels via a translator in the coastal city, although the Melbourne channels can be received in Lorne with a high-gain mast antenna system aiming at Mount Dandenong.

Lorne receives radio stations from Melbourne and Geelong. Previously, Mixx FM was broadcasting into Lorne via a translator on 92.7 FM, but this was turned off in August 2021 due to low listenership and the clear reception of Melbourne and Geelong FM stations. A translator for OCR FM on 88.7 FM is available for local radio in Lorne.

==Climate==
Lorne has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild summers and cool, damp winters.

<text>The EBow, short for electronic bow or energy bow, is an electronic device used for playing string instruments, most often the electric guitar. It is manufactured by Heet Sound Products of Los Angeles, California. It was invented by Greg Heet in 1969, introduced in 1976 and patented in 1978.

The EBow uses a pickup in an inductive string driver feedback circuit, including a sensor coil, driver coil and amplifier, to vibrate strings, producing a sound reminiscent of using a bow on the strings.

==History==
The EBow was introduced in 1976 at NAMM, and has remained in continuous production since. The first version was activated by plucking the guitar string. The second, introduced in 1983, added an on/off switch and a more powerful drive. The third, introduced in 1989, had improved sensitivity and faster attack. The EBow Plus, introduced in 1998, adds a blue LED and a switch to allow users to move between normal and harmonic modes (which sounds one octave higher). It is powered by a nine-volt battery.

==Function==
The EBow uses a pickup and a magnetic feedback circuit to vibrate strings without touching them. Whereas guitars traditionally have fast attack and slow release, meaning notes ring immediately and then fade out, the EBow can sustain notes indefinitely and gives greater control over attack and decay. The EBow can only play one string at a time, but can be moved across the strings to play arpeggios. It can produce sounds similar to cello or violin.

==Use==
The EBow was particularly popular in 1980s music, used by acts such as Big Country, Tones on Tail, Love and Rockets and Bill Nelson. The Love and Rockets guitarist Daniel Ash said the EBow &quot;changed everything for me ... [It] basically turns the guitar into a keyboard ... It completely opened up the sound of the guitar.&quot;

The EBow has been used to create background textures or sustained notes similar to guitar feedback, as in &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; (1976) by Blue Öyster Cult and &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; (1996) by Alice in Chains. It was used by the Edge on the 1983 U2 album &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and by Noel Gallagher on the 1996 Oasis song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;.

The EBow was prominently used by the Siouxsie and the Banshees guitarist John McGeoch on &quot;Sin in My Heart&quot;, from the 1981 album &quot;Juju&quot;. The EBow is used by the Radiohead guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien for performances of songs such as &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, &quot;Talk Show Host&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw Falling Into Place&quot;, &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; and &quot;Nude&quot;. Other users include Duran Duran, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Van Halen, Metallica and the Foo Fighters.

In the 1980s, the Bongos used the EBow in the intro of their song &quot;Numbers With Wings&quot; and in &quot;River To River&quot;, &quot;Miss Jean&quot;, &quot;Glow&quot;, &quot;Flew A Falcon&quot; and &quot;Sweet Blue Cage&quot;. Frontman Richard Barone continues to use an EBow on his subsequent solo recordings and much of his production work including his songs &quot;Love is a Wind that Screams&quot; and his cover of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;The Visit&quot;.

<text>Charles William Sweeney (27 December 1919 – 16 July 2004) was an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and the pilot who flew &quot;Bockscar&quot; carrying the Fat Man atomic bomb to the Japanese city of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945. Separating from active duty at the end of World War II, he later became an officer in the Massachusetts Air National Guard as the Army Air Forces transitioned to an independent United States Air Force, eventually rising to the rank of major general.

==Military career==
===509th Composite Group===
Sweeney became an instructor in the atomic missions training project, Project Alberta, at Wendover Army Airfield, Utah. Selected to be part of the 509th Composite Group commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets, he was named commander of the 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 6 January 1945. Initially his squadron used C-47 Skytrain and C-46 Commando transports on hand to conduct the top secret operations to supply the 509th, but in April 1945 it acquired five C-54 Skymasters, which had the range to deliver personnel and materiel to the western Pacific area.

On 4 May 1945, Sweeney became commander of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, the combat element of the 509th, in charge of 15 Silverplate B-29s and their flight and ground crews, 535 men in all. In June and July Sweeney moved his unit to North Field on the island of Tinian in the Marianas.

In addition to supervising the intensive training of his flight crews during July 1945, Sweeney was slated to command the second atomic bomb mission. He trained with the crew of Captain (Charles D.) Don Albury aboard their B-29 &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, and was aircraft commander on the training mission of 11 July. He and the crew flew five of the nine rehearsal test drops of inert Little Boy and Fat Man bomb assemblies in preparation for the missions.

On 6 August 1945, Sweeney and Albury piloted &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; as the instrumentation and observation support aircraft for the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima.

===Bombing of Nagasaki===

On 9 August 1945, Major Sweeney commanded &quot;Bockscar&quot;, which carried the atomic bomb &quot;Fat Man&quot; from the island of Tinian to Nagasaki. In addition to &quot;Bockscar&quot;, the mission included two observation and instrumentation support B-29s, &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; and &quot;The Big Stink&quot;, which would rendezvous with &quot;Bockscar&quot; over Yakushima Island. At the mission pre-briefing, the three planes were ordered to make their rendezvous over Yakushima at due to weather conditions over Iwo Jima (the Hiroshima mission rendezvous). That same morning, on the day of the mission, the ground crew notified Sweeney that a faulty fuel transfer pump made it impossible to utilize some of fuel in the tail, but Sweeney, as aircraft commander, elected to proceed with the mission.

Before takeoff, Tibbets warned Sweeney that he had lost at least 45 minutes of flying time because of the fuel pump problem, and to take no more than fifteen minutes at the rendezvous before proceeding directly to the primary target.

After takeoff from Tinian, &quot;Bockscar&quot; reached its rendezvous point and after circling for an extended period, found &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, but not &quot;The Big Stink&quot;. Climbing to 30,000 feet, the assigned rendezvous altitude, both aircraft slowly circled Yakushima Island. Though Sweeney had been ordered not to wait at the rendezvous for the other aircraft longer than fifteen minutes before proceeding to the primary target, Sweeney continued to wait for &quot;The Big Stink&quot;, perhaps at the urging of Commander Frederick Ashworth, the plane&#x27;s weaponeer. After exceeding the original rendezvous time limit by a half-hour, &quot;Bockscar&quot;, accompanied by &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, proceeded to the primary target, Kokura. No fewer than three bomb runs were made, but the delay at the rendezvous had resulted in 7/10ths cloud cover over the primary target, and the bombardier was unable to drop. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Japanese fighter planes could be seen climbing to intercept &quot;Bockscar&quot;.

Poor bombing visibility and an increasingly critical fuel shortage eventually forced &quot;Bockscar&quot; to divert from Kokura and attack the secondary target, Nagasaki. As they approached Nagasaki, the heart of the city&#x27;s downtown was covered by dense cloud, and Sweeney and Ashworth, initially decided to bomb Nagasaki using radar. However, a small opening in the clouds allowed &quot;Bockscar&#x27;s&quot; bombardier to verify the target as Nagasaki. The crew had been ordered to drop the bomb visually if possible; Sweeney decided to proceed with a visual bomb run. &quot;Bockscar&quot; then dropped &quot;Fat Man&quot;, with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT. It exploded 43 seconds later at above the ground, at least northwest of the planned aim point. The failure to drop &quot;Fat Man&quot; at the precise bomb aim point caused the atomic blast to be confined to the Urakami Valley. As a consequence, a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, and around 30% of Nagasaki was destroyed. The bombing also severed the Mitsubishi arms production extensively and killed an estimated 35,000–40,000 people outright, including 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers.

Low on fuel, &quot;Bockscar&quot; barely made it to the runway on Okinawa. With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney brought &quot;Bockscar&quot; in fast and hard, ordering every available distress flare on board to be fired as he did so. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as &quot;Bockscar&quot; began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. With both pilots standing on the brakes, Sweeney made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid going over the cliff into the ocean. 2nd Lt. Jacob Beser recalled that at this point, two engines had died from the fuel starvation, while &quot;the centrifugal force resulting from the turn was almost enough to put us through the side of the airplane.&quot;

After &quot;Bockscar&quot; returned to Tinian, Tibbets recorded that he was faced with the dilemma of considering “if any action should be taken against the airplane commander, Charles Sweeney, for failure to command.” After meeting on Guam with Tibbets and Sweeney, General Curtis LeMay, chief of staff for the Strategic Air Forces, confronted Sweeney, stating, &quot;You fucked up, didn&#x27;t you, Chuck?&quot;, to which Sweeney made no reply. LeMay then turned to Tibbets and told him that an investigation into Sweeney&#x27;s conduct of the mission would serve no useful purpose.

In November 1945, Sweeney returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Base in New Mexico to train aircrews for the atomic testing mission, Operation Crossroads.

==Post-war activities==
Sweeney left active duty with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 28 June 1946, but remained active with the Massachusetts Air National Guard. Later promoted to full colonel, on 21 February 1956, Sweeney was named commander of its 102nd Air Defense Wing and shortly after, on 6 April, was promoted to brigadier general. During this time, he was activated with the 102nd and served in Europe during the Berlin Crisis from October 1961 to August 1962. Sweeney was made chief of staff in October 1967.

In the 1960s, Sweeney coordinated civil defense in Boston, serving as the Boston Director of Civil Defense.

He retired in 1976 as a major general in the Air National Guard. He also appeared in the 1970s television series &quot;The World at War&quot; and was seen explaining the USAAF buildup to the mission raids.

Throughout his life Sweeney remained convinced of the appropriateness and necessity of the bombing. &quot;I saw these beautiful young men who were being slaughtered by an evil, evil military force,&quot; he said in 1995. &quot;There&#x27;s no question in my mind that President Truman made the right decision.&quot; At the same time, he said, &quot;As the man who commanded the last atomic mission, I pray that I retain that singular distinction.&quot;

==Later life==

Near the end of his life, Sweeney wrote a controversial and factually disputed memoir of the atomic bombing and the 509th Composite Group, &quot;War&#x27;s End: An Eyewitness Account of America&#x27;s Last Atomic Mission&quot;. In &quot;War&#x27;s End&quot;, Sweeney defended the decision to drop the atomic bomb in light of subsequent historical questioning. However, it was Sweeney&#x27;s other assertions regarding the Nagasaki atomic mission, along with various anecdotes regarding the 509th and its crews that drew the most criticism. Tibbets, Major &quot;Dutch&quot; Van Kirk, Colonel Thomas Ferebee and others vigorously disputed Sweeney&#x27;s account of events. Partly in response to &quot;War&#x27;s End&quot;, Tibbets issued a revised version of his own autobiography in 1998, adding a new section on the Nagasaki attack in which he harshly criticized Sweeney&#x27;s actions during the mission.

In his later years Sweeney performed in various air shows doing many maneuvers to awe crowds. Sweeney died at age 84 on 16 July 2004, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

A short documentary featuring an audio recording of Sweeney describing the Nagasaki mission preparation and execution called &quot;Nagasaki: The Commander&#x27;s Voice&quot; was made in 2005. The 2002 audio recording was the last one made before his death.

<doc id="839582" wikidata="Q3282503" url="?curid=839582" title="Demolition Plot J-7">
<text>Demolition Plot J-7 is the second EP by American indie rock band Pavement, released on June 1, 1990. The EP was the band&#x27;s first release on Chicago independent label Drag City, and its first release that was not self-issued. It is also the band&#x27;s only release to feature drummer Jason Turner. &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; shared many of the same indie and punk rock influences of Pavement&#x27;s 1989 debut &quot;Slay Tracks: 1933–1969&quot;, but also diversified the group&#x27;s sound by incorporating keyboards.

Many of the songs on &quot;Demolition J-7&quot; were written while Scott Kannberg and Jason Turner were in their short-lived band, Pa. After Stephen Malkmus heard demos recorded by Pa, the songs turned into a Pavement project. The recording session for &quot;Demolition J-7&quot; was more difficult than for &quot;Slay Tracks&quot; due to tension between producer Gary Young and Turner. The EP received favorable reception from critics and fans, and solidified the band&#x27;s cult fanbase.

==Background==
Pavement had attained a degree of success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP &quot;Slay Tracks: 1933–1969&quot;. While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed &quot;Slay Track&quot;&#x27;s release on the band&#x27;s self-owned label, Treble Kicker. &quot;Slay Tracks&quot; caught the attention of Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond &quot;Slay Tracks&quot;, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said &quot;I started talking to [Koretzky] and in our conversations he said &#x27;I&#x27;m starting this label. Do you want to do something for us?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Well I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re even a band. Steve is off in Europe.&#x27; He said, &quot;Well if you want to I&#x27;m up for it.&#x27;&quot;

While Malkmus was still abroad, Kannberg moved in with a friend and his roommate Jason Turner in Sacramento, California. Turner and Kannberg formed a new band called Pa, with Turner on drums. Kannberg said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know if Pavement was going to do anything so I just said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s start another band.&#x27;&quot; The duo frequently jammed, and considered a future release on Drag City. Pa recorded a series of instrumental demos, including new songs &quot;Two States&quot;, &quot;Forklift&quot;, and &quot;Collapse&quot;, at Young&#x27;s Louder Than You Think studios during a trip to Stockton. After Kannberg and Fawkes had returned to Sacramento, Malkmus visited and the group decided to turn the Pa songs into a Pavement project. Malkmus wrote lyrics to &quot;Forklift&quot; and presented the band with &quot;two or three other songs&quot; he had previously written.

==Recording==
&quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; was, like &quot;Slay Tracks&quot; and the Pa demos, recorded by Gary Young at his Louder Than You Think studios in Stockton. The recording took place on October 16 and October 17, 1989. Malkmus was influenced by the rehearsal style of jazz musicians as significant to the EP&#x27;s recording, saying &quot;When we start recording, we&#x27;re really focused on what we&#x27;re doing. We know how it&#x27;s going to sound in the studio. We don&#x27;t have to worry if it&#x27;s sounding good in the rehearsal space. We take those prescriptions from the great jazz people and applied them to our own framework.&quot;

The addition of Turner to the band created tension with Young. Young had served as the primary drummer on &quot;Slay Tracks&quot;, with Malkmus and Kannberg drumming on a few songs. Young did not play any drums for the &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; sessions, and expressed jealousy towards Turner, openly mocking the new drummer. However, Turner ultimately only played drums on the EP&#x27;s opening track &quot;Forklift&quot;, and Malkmus and Kannberg performed the rest of the songs.

==Composition and lyrics==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Heather Phares wrote in Allmusic&#x27;s biography of Pavement that, with &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot;, Pavement &quot;had begun to forge [their] influences into its own signature sound.&quot; A review in the &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; likened the EP&#x27;s sound to &quot;a cross between The Fall (circa &quot;Frenz Experiment&quot;) and Half Japanese&quot;. A review in &quot;LA Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;The guitar on &#x27;Internal K-Dart&#x27; and &#x27;Fork Lift&#x27; is patently similar to Big Black and Dinosaur Jr., but Pavement steer clear of the former&#x27;s pretentiously bleak posturing and the latter&#x27;s dreary self-pity&quot;. Malkmus noted the influence that jazz musicians had on the EP&#x27;s recording, and acknowledged jazz albums &quot;Interstellar Space&quot; by John Coltrane and &quot;Andrew!!!&quot; by Andrew Hill as two of his favorite records. The EP is Pavement&#x27;s first to incorporate keyboards.

The first song on the album, &quot;Forklift&quot;, features fuzzy guitar effects, like much of the band&#x27;s early material. &quot;Forklift&quot; also incorporates what Pavement biographer Rob Jovanovic calls &quot;almost Kraftwerk-sounding&quot; overdubbed electronic keyboard sounds in the chorus. &quot;Spizzle Trunk&quot; is a punk-influenced track with &quot;thrashy guitars&quot;, but it also includes &quot;barroom Jerry Lee Lewis piano buried in the mix&quot;. The next two tracks, &quot;Recorder Grot&quot; and &quot;Internal K-Dart&quot;, are both heavy and guitar-oriented songs. &quot;Perfect Depth&quot; is, according to Jovanovic, a &quot;gloriously messy sonic assault&quot;, and &quot;reflects a more considered Malkmus attempt at lyric crafting, even if they are nonsensical and almost impossible to hear&quot;. The EP ends with &quot;Recorder Grot (Rally)&quot;, a 21-second instrumental of guitar feedback.

==Release and reception==
Between the release of &quot;Slay Tracks&quot; and the recording sessions for &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot;, Koretzky formed Drag City with Dan Osborn. The first release from the label was the Royal Trux single &quot;Hero Zero&quot;, which sold well. Despite the new label&#x27;s early financial struggles, Drag City used the profit from &quot;Hero Zero&quot; to press and release 1000 copies of &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot;. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP, as he had done previously with &quot;Slay Tracks&quot;.

&quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; was met with favorable reviews upon its release, though most of these reviews were from underground music zines. One of the few reviewers from a major periodical to review &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; upon its release, Robert Christgau of the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, gave the EP a two-star honorable mention, citing &quot;Forklift&quot; as a highlight.

&quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; was ranked as the fourth best EP of 1990 in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop Critic&#x27;s Poll. &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; helped define the early &quot;messed-up, art-steeped guitar noise&quot; sound of Drag City, which would become a seminal independent label. Donna Freydkin of CNN.com wrote in a 1999 retrospective of the band&#x27;s history that &quot;it was with the release of the 1990 EP [&quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot;] that Pavement secured a devoted following.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; writer Michaelangelo Matos noted &quot;Demolition Plot J-7&quot; and its follow-up, the 1991 EP &quot;Perfect Sound Forever&quot;, as &quot;epochal to ... sloppy early-&#x27;90s undergrads.&quot;

<doc id="839592" wikidata="Q4809067" url="?curid=839592" title="Lake Uluabat">
<text>Lake Uluabat ( and ) is the name of a freshwater lake in the vicinity of Bursa, Turkey. It is a large lake, covering an area of between 135 and 160 km2 depending on the water level, but very shallow, being only 3 m deep at its deepest point. The lake contains eight islands and one other that is sometimes an island and sometimes a peninsula. The largest island is known as Halilbey Island. In the southwest the lake is fed by the Mustafakemalpaşa River, which has formed a silty delta. Water leaves the lake by way of the Ulubat stream, flowing to the west, and reaches the Sea of Marmara via the Susurluk River.

Most shores of the lake are covered in submerged plants, and it has the most extensive white water lily beds in Turkey. Uluabat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax pygmeus&quot;). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 squacco heron pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Uluabat.

The alternative name Lake &quot;Apolyont&quot; comes from the lake&#x27;s greek classical name Apolloniatis (&quot;Απολλωνιάτις&quot;), from Apollonia-on-the-Rhyndacum (modern Gölyazı), an ancient Greek city situated on its banks which had considerable importance since it was on major trade routes.

Modern residential areas by its shores are Mustafakemalpaşa (formerly Kirmasti) and Karacabey (formerly Mikalick). The area was famous for centuries for its silkworm cultivation, but this industry has died out due to synthetic fabrics. The main industry today is fishing.

==History==
==Overview==

Uluabat Lake was recognized by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The Global Nature Fund designated the lake as a &quot;Living Lake&quot; in 1998.

==Hydrology==

Lake Uluabat empties into the Sea of Marmara via the Susurluk River. The Lake is fed by the Mustafakemalpaşa River.

==Ecology==

Lake Uluabat is a large, long, shallow inland lake that is surrounded by marshes and agricultural land. There are submerged plants on the shores of the lake. According to the Global Nature Fund, there is nowhere in Turkey with more white water lily beds than Lake Uluabat.

==Islands and peninsulas==
There are seven islands in the lake, including Halilbey Island.—which is the largest island, and St. Constantine—known for the Byzantine era monastery. Today St. Constantine island is uninhabited, but the monastery has survived the Ottoman conquest of Asia Minor. The orthodox monastery has received attention from scholars because of its inscribed cross type with apses east and west.

One of the most well-known features of Lake Uluabat is the small island village of Gölyazı—an ancient Greek settlement near modern-day Bursa. Gölyazı was featured in the final episode of the Turkish TV series &quot;Kara Para Aşk&quot;. The Gölyazı Old Mosque, located on the peninsula is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Wildlife==

The lake, which has an &quot;Unprotected Status&quot; (UP), was declared by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area in 1989 for its waterfowl species of international character and species which are globally threatened. Uluabat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax pygmeus&quot;). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 squacco heron pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Uluabat.

There are 21 species of fish in Lake Uluabat.

<doc id="839595" wikidata="Q966198" url="?curid=839595" title="Jean Eustache">
<text>Jean Eustache (; 30 November 1938 – 5 November 1981) was a French film director and editor. During his short career, he completed numerous short films, in addition to a pair of highly regarded features, of which the first, &quot;The Mother and the Whore&quot;, is considered a key work of post-Nouvelle Vague French cinema.

In his obituary for Eustache, the critic Serge Daney wrote:In the thread of the desolate 70s, his films succeeded one another, always unforeseen, without a system, without a gap: film-rivers, short films, TV programs, hyperreal fiction. Each film went to the end of its material, from real to fictional sorrow. It was impossible for him to go against it, to calculate, to take cultural success into account, impossible for this theoretician of seduction to seduce an audience.

Jim Jarmusch dedicated his 2005 film &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; to Eustache.

==Biography==
Eustache was born in Pessac, Gironde, France, into a working class family. Relatively little information exists about Eustache&#x27;s life prior to the time he became a member of the &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; coterie in the late 1950s, though it is known that he was largely self-educated and worked in the railroad service prior to becoming a filmmaker. Information suggests that the mystery surrounding his youth was intentional, with sources stating that &quot;during his lifetime Eustache published little information about his early years, indicating that he felt no nostalgia for an unhappy childhood.&quot;

Though not a member of the Nouvelle vague, Eustache maintained ties to it, appearing as an actor in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Week End&quot; and editing Luc Moullet&#x27;s &quot;Une aventure de Billy le Kid&quot;, which starred Jean-Pierre Léaud (the lead in Eustache&#x27;s &quot;The Mother and the Whore&quot;).

After becoming a filmmaker, Eustache maintained close ties to his friends and relatives in Pessac. In 1981, he was partially immobilized in an auto accident. He killed himself by gunshot in his Paris apartment, at age 42.

Eustache had a son, Boris Eustache (born 1960), who worked on his father&#x27;s second feature and appears as an actor in Eustache&#x27;s short film &quot;Les Photos d&#x27;Alix&quot;.

== Work ==
Eustache was quoted as saying, &quot;The films I made are as autobiographical as fiction can be&quot;. Besides his fictional shorts and features, Eustache made numerous documentaries, including several shot in his hometown of Pessac, and a feature-length interview with his grandmother.

Eustache directed two narrative features. &quot;The Mother and the Whore&quot; (&quot;La maman et la putain&quot;), the first, is a 217-minute rumination on love, relationships, men and women. The film&#x27;s central three-way romance plot focuses on Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), his girlfriend Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and the nurse he meets and falls in love with, Veronika (Françoise Lebrun).

Writing for &quot;Time Out New York&quot; in 1999, Andrew Johnston described his experience viewing the film: 

Eustache&#x27;s second feature, &quot;My Little Loves&quot; (&quot;Mes petites amoureuses&quot;, 1974), was intentionally different from his debut. Shot in color by cinematographer Nestor Almendros (as opposed to &quot;The Mother and the Whore&quot;&#x27;s grainy black-and-white), the film also features significantly less dialogue and focuses on teenage characters in a rural setting. The film was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival.

Eustache appeared as an actor in &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977).

=== Remakes and serial works ===
Eustache made two films about a religious parade in Pessac, both titled &quot;La Rosière de Pessac&quot;, in 1968 and 1979, and remade his short &quot;Une sale histoire&quot; twice. Regarding the tendency to re-examine in Eustache&#x27;s work, the American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote: &quot;An obsessive-compulsive filmmaker and clearly a tormented one who wound up dying by his own hand, Eustache was clearly experimenting with his variations as well as goading viewers into examining their own reactions to them&quot;.

<text>Louise Marion Jameson (born 20 April 1951) is an English actress with a variety of television and theatre credits. Her roles on television have included playing Leela in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1977–1978), Anne Reynolds in &quot;The Omega Factor&quot; (1979), Blanche Simmons in &quot;Tenko&quot; (1981–1982), Susan Young in &quot;Bergerac&quot; (1985–1990), Rosa di Marco in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1998–2000) and Mary Goskirk in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (2022–present).

According to Screenonline, Jameson &quot;was one of a handful of actresses who both benefited from and contributed to the opening out of roles for women on British television during the 1970s and 80s, when she became associated with a series of tough, resourceful and independent characters in genres where women had conventionally been either victims or vamps.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Jameson was born in Wanstead, Essex and grew up in nearby Woodford Green. Jameson attended the independent Braeside School, Buckhurst Hill. She attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art from the ages of seventeen to nineteen and shared a flat with fellow drama students Sherrie Hewson and Sharon Maughan before spending two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company, performing in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Summerfolk&quot;, and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. Her early TV career highlights include appearances on &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; in 1973 as Sharon Crossthwaite, the first character in the soap to be murdered, and roles in &quot;Z-Cars&quot; and the television film &quot;The Game&quot; in 1977. She also appeared opposite Mike Raven in the low budget British horror film &quot;Disciple of Death&quot; (1972).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===

Jameson came to widespread attention when she was cast by director Pennant Roberts as Leela, the leather-clad companion of the Fourth Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The character is a warrior of the fictional Sevateem people, and was introduced in &quot;The Face of Evil&quot; (1977). Jameson&#x27;s inspirations for the way that she played the character included her dog, for &quot;her instinctive nature and tendency to slightly cock her head when she perceives something&quot;, and a neighbour&#x27;s child, for &quot;openness and naïveté&quot;.

Jameson&#x27;s costuming in the series receives much comment and some criticism from feminists, with Mark Duguid writing for Screenonline that it &quot;said much about the failure of 1970s feminism to permeate the BBC&#x27;s production or costume departments&quot;. Valerie Estelle Frankel, in her book on &quot;Women in Doctor Who&quot;, characterises Leela as &quot;a classic warrior woman&quot; but says that the seriousness of the character is undermined because &quot;her provocatively cut hunting leathers and cleavage are offered to the male gaze in every episode.&quot; Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; also regarded her as &quot;a companion to lure in adolescent lads and their dads&quot; but, while considering her debut serial to be a &quot;lifeless tale&quot;, he wrote that Jameson was &quot;a wonderful find. Exuding commitment and conviction, she makes Leela earnest, warm and funny, elevating her far beyond Robert Holmes&#x27;s desire for a &#x27;Raquel Welch in the jungle&#x27;. Quite simply, she&#x27;s one of the most naturally gifted actresses ever to play a companion.&quot; In 2008 Jameson said, &quot;In a way the companion was a bit of a device when I was in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, though I did love her feistiness and her intelligence and her aggression and her intelligence – even though she wasn&#x27;t educated.&quot;

Jameson was initially paid £120 an episode for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, later increasing to £150 an episode. She left the series after nine serials, departing in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; (1978).

===After &quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Jameson went on to appear in &quot;The Omega Factor&quot; (1979) as Dr. Anne Reynolds. She later had a leading role as Blanche Simmons in the first two series of &quot;Tenko&quot;, before starring for five years in the late 1980s in &quot;Bergerac&quot; as Susan Young, Jim Bergerac&#x27;s girlfriend. In the mid-1980s, she played Tania Braithwaite, Pandora&#x27;s mother, in both &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole&quot; and &quot;The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole&quot; for Thames Television. In the early 1990s, she starred in the two series of &quot;Rides&quot;, and made numerous one-off appearances in various TV drama series, as well as numerous &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off projects including the &quot;Children in Need&quot; special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; (1993). In 1995, she appeared in the RSC production of Botho Strauß&#x27;s &quot;The Park&quot;. Other stage appearances include the first production of Peter Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Passion Play&quot; produced at the Aldwych Theatre, London, in 1981. In 1998, Jameson began a long run in the BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Rosa di Marco, appearing in over 200 episodes over two and a half years until August 2000. Since then, she has appeared in episodes of the BBC Scotland soap &quot;River City&quot; as Viv Roberts, as a guest artist in episodes of &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot; and as a regular in &quot;Doc Martin&quot;.

Jameson continues to reprise the characters of Leela and Anne Reynolds in audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions and has also starred in &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio dramas for the same company. She has also appeared in documentaries and commentaries accompanying numerous BBC DVD releases of her &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials. She is the subject of MJTV&#x27;s &quot;The Actor Speaks&quot; Volume 5, where she discusses herself, her acting career and the various series she has been in. In 2007, Jameson toured nationally in her one-woman show, &quot;Face Value&quot;. In 2013, she starred in the play &quot;Gutted&quot; by Rikki Beadle-Blair and was nominated for Best Female Performance at the 2013 Off West End Theatre Awards (Offies). In November 2013, she appeared in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;. In 2016, she toured in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, the longest running show in British theatre. In 2022, she joined the cast of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; as Mary Goskirk.

== Personal life ==
In 1990, Jameson married Martin Bedford, an artist whom she had met while filming &quot;Bergerac&quot; in Jersey. They divorced in 1997. 

Jameson was a regular prison visitor, monitoring prisoners&#x27; welfare, during the first few years of her career; and, during the early 1970s, she met Leslie Grantham at Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire, where he was serving 12 years of a life sentence for murder. She encouraged Grantham to become an actor.

<text>Mohammed Mahdi Al Tajir () (born 26 December 1931) is a Bahrana-Emirati businessman based in the United Kingdom. He was the first United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United Kingdom and non resident ambassador to France. Al Tajir spends much of his time at his London home or at Keir House, his Stirlingshire estate. He has interests in finance and property, and owns the Highland Spring bottled water company.

Al Tajir was named one of Scotland&#x27;s richest men with wealth of £1.72 billion in the Sunday Times Rich List 2010.

==Life==
Mohammed Mahdi Al Tajir was born in December 1931 in Bahrain, and educated at Preston Grammar School in Lancashire. Al Tajir is married with five children. 

Al Tajir&#x27;s 15,000 acre Blackford estate in Perthshire, Scotland is owned by his company Park Tower Holding Establishment, based in the tax haven of Liechtenstein. Al Tajir also owns London&#x27;s Sheraton Park Tower Hotel at 101 Knightsbridge near Hyde Park and Mereworth Castle in Kent, which he purchased in 1976 for $1.2 million.

In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner Hani Salaam.

Al Tajir has an extensive collection of silver artifacts and carpets. In 1993 Al Tajir paid the record price for a piece of silver at auction, when he bought a 1736 silver chandelier made by Balthasar Friedrich Behrens for £2.27 million at Christie&#x27;s in Monaco. 

Al Tajir formed a joint venture with Bonhams fine art auction house to open an office in Dubai.

Al Tajir&#x27;s son, Maher al-Tajir, was found guilty of assaulting his girlfriend at Keir House in 2009.

==Business career==
Appointed head of customs in Dubai by Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, he became one of Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s most trusted advisors and was made the first Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the United Kingdom when the UAE was founded in 1971. Under a thinly disguised name, Al Tajir&#x27;s exploits as a negotiator were recorded in the 1976 novel &quot;Dubai&quot; by Robin Moore. 

In 1963, Al Tajir became director of Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s Petroleum affairs and effectively the most powerful man in Dubai after Sheikh Rashid himself. Al Tajir lost or resigned his position in 1981 with the downfall of Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s health and the waning of his personal power, with the ascedency of Shekih Rashid&#x27;s sons. Al Tajir remained UAE ambassador to the United Kingdom until 1987. 

In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman. Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities. 

Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz&#x27;s Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Al Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed&#x27;s offer of a formal partnership. Al-Fayed earned £1.5 million commission from the contract for British engineering company Costain to carry out the improvement works to the port. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the Dubai World Trade Centre. 

By the mid 1970s Costain had gained over £280 million of contracts thanks to Al-Fayed and Al Tajir. Al Tajir&#x27;s influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain&#x27;s future profits at risk. In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai&#x27;s Department of Economic Development. Alabbar had been appointed by Sheikh Maktoum to eradicate the system of large commission payments from previous decades. Al Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai&#x27;s aluminium smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the Dubai World Trade Centre.

The construction of Dubai&#x27;s aluminium smelter caused Al Tajir to fall out with Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s sons. In the judgement of a British court case, Al Tajir conspired to defraud Dubai Aluminium of millions of US dollars in connivance with commodities trader Marc Rich, who owned a neighbouring property in Switzerland.

Al Tajir owns a glass-bottling company in Dubai and a private bank in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands.

<text>Education in Kansas is governed at the primary and secondary school level by the Kansas State Board of Education. The state&#x27;s public colleges and universities are supervised by the Kansas Board of Regents.

== Colleges and universities ==
The Kansas Board of Regents governs or supervises thirty-seven public institutions. It also authorizes numerous private and out-of-state institutions to operate in the state. In Fall 2009, the state&#x27;s six public universities reported a combined enrollment of 93,307 students, of which more than a quarter were non-resident students and more than a seventh were off-campus enrollments.

Among the state-funded universities, the University of Kansas (KU) is the largest in terms of enrollment, with 26,826 at its Lawrence campus, KU Edwards Campus in Overland Park, and Public Management Center (formerly the Capitol Complex) in Topeka. The total university enrollment, which includes KU Medical Center, was 30,004. About 31% were non-resident students.

Kansas State University (KSU) has the second largest enrollment, with 23,581 students at its Manhattan and Salina campuses and Veterinary Medical Center. About 19% were non-resident students. Wichita State University (WSU) ranks third largest with 14,823 students; about 14% were non-resident students. WSU has lost nearly 3,000 students since the school dropped football following the 1986 season. Fort Hays State University (FHSU), Pittsburg State University (PSU), and Emporia State University (ESU) are smaller public universities with total enrollments of 11,308, 7277, and 6314, respectively. FHSU has the fastest growing enrollment in Kansas with most of it coming from non-resident and off-campus enrollment. The composition of FHSU&#x27;s enrollment includes 35% non-resident students and 44% off-campus enrollments. PSU also has almost a quarter of enrollment from non-residents.

For more on the universities and colleges in Kansas, see the complete list.

===History===

The first colleges in Kansas were chartered by acts of the Kansas Territorial legislature, signed by Territorial Governor James W. Denver, on February 9–12, 1858. Among the ten institutes of higher learning chartered at that time, three survive in some form. Among those chartered on February 9 were Highland University (precursor to Highland Community College) and Blue Mont Central College (precursor to Kansas State University). Baker University, chartered on February 12, 1858, has been operating continuously since that time and is now recognized as the oldest continuously operating college in Kansas.

All of the colleges founded in 1858 were private institutions. The first public institute of higher learning in the state was Kansas State University (originally named Kansas State Agricultural College), which was established by the state legislature on February 16, 1863.

The state&#x27;s universities were among the first public universities in the country to be coeducational. Kansas State became the second coeducational public institution of higher education when it opened in 1863; enrollment for the first session was 52 students: 26 men and 26 women. The University of Kansas was also among the earliest to offer mixed-sex education, in 1869. Both KU and Kansas State were also open to students of all races from their inception.

==Primary and secondary schools==

===School district consolidation===
The number of students in rural communities dropped significantly across the 20th century. As farming technology progressed from animal power to small tractors towards large tractors over time, it allowed a farmer to support significantly more farm land. In turn, this led to fewer farm families, which led to fewer rural students. In combination with a loss of young men during foreign wars and rural flight, all of these caused an incremental population shrinkage of rural communities over time. In 1945 (after World War II), the &quot;School Reorganization Act&quot; in Kansas caused the consolidation of thousands of rural school districts in Kansas (mostly one room rural school houses). In 1963, the &quot;School Unification Act&quot; in Kansas caused the further consolidatation of thousands of tiny school districts into hundreds of larger Unified School Districts.

===&quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot;===
The landmark 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot;, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was brought as a legal challenge to a Kansas law permitting racial segregation in primary and secondary schools in Kansas towns with a population over 15,000.

In 1951, a class action suit was filed against the Board of Education of the City of Topeka, Kansas in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs were thirteen Topeka parents on behalf of their 20 children.

The suit called for the school district to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black and white students in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.

The named plaintiff, Oliver L. Brown, was a parent, a welder in the shops of the Santa Fe Railroad, an assistant pastor at his local church, and an African American. He was convinced to join the lawsuit by Scott, a childhood friend. Brown&#x27;s daughter Linda, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6 km) away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.

===Evolution controversy===
In 1999, the Kansas Board of Education ruled that instruction at the primary and secondary levels about evolution, the age of the Earth, and the origin of the universe was permitted, but not mandatory, and that those topics would not appear on state standardized tests. However, two years later, following a change in its elected membership, the Board reversed this decision on February 14, 2001, ruling that instruction of all those topics was mandatory and that they would appear on standardized tests.

Following another change in membership, on August 9, 2005, the Board of Education approved a draft of science curriculum standards that mandated equal time for evolution and intelligent design. 
On November 8, 2005, the Board of Education voted 6–4 to allow science students in public schools to hear materials critical of evolution in biology classes, allowing teaching of Intelligent design to be taught in classes. The board, in order to accommodate the teaching of Intelligent Design in biology class, went so far as to redefine the meaning of science to &quot; &#x27;no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena.&#x27; &quot;

In response, USD 383 (Manhattan-Ogden) decided to reject the November 2005 standards in a unanimous decision in February 2006, and continues to use the March 9, 2005 standards. 

On August 1, 2006, the creationist majority on the Board of Education was voted out of office and evolution candidates were given the majority once again.

On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again limited to &quot;the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe.&quot;

===Sports===
Statewide elections for the Kansas Board of Education are held every four years.
According to Christopher Lee, small town Kansas high schools used football as a way to entertain and unite their rural communities. The schools were too small for 11-man teams so they adopted the six-man team system developed by Stephen E. Epler. Football stimulated a collective spirit between school and community, with the games becoming a social outlet and a favorite topic of weeklong conversations and boosterism. There was an economic bonus as well when hundreds of fans drove into small depression-hit towns. Six-man football peaked in the mid-1950s. However the decline on younger rural populations and school consolidation led schools to move to eight-man football by the 1960s.

<doc id="839621" wikidata="Q247232" url="?curid=839621" title="Stroke play">
<text>Stroke play is a scoring system in the sport of golf. In the regular form of stroke play, also known as medal play, the total number of strokes is counted over one or more rounds of 18 holes. In a regular stroke play competition, the winner is the player who has taken the fewest strokes over the course of the round, or rounds. Other forms of stroke play include Stableford, whereby points are gained based on hole scores, maximum score, in which there is a limit to the number of strokes that may be taken on each hole, and par (or bogey), where holes are won or lost against a target score on each hole.

Although most professional tournaments are played using the regular stroke play scoring system, some notable exceptions exist. In match play, the player, or team, earns a point for each hole in which they have bested their opponents. Match play scoring is used in the WGC-Match Play Championship, the World Match Play Championship, and most team events, for example the Ryder Cup. A few tournaments such as the Barracuda Championship have used a modified Stableford system.

==Scoring==
In stroke play scoring, players record the number of strokes taken at each hole and total them up at the end of a given round, or rounds. The player with the lowest total is the winner. In handicap competitions, the players would subtract their handicaps from the total (gross) score to generate their net scores, and the player with the lowest net score is the winner.

Scores may be reported in relation to par for easy comparison with other golfers&#x27; scores. For example, a player whose score is three strokes over par after a given hole would appear as &quot;+3&quot; on the scoreboard.

If two or more players have the same number of strokes, it may be desired to determine an outright winner. Two of the more common methods are a playoff and scorecard count back.

===Cut===
Multi-round tournaments may enforce a &quot;cut&quot; to reduce the size of the field for later rounds. In a typical 72-hole elite tournament, played over one or two courses, there is a cut after 36 holes; tournaments played over three courses have a cut after 54 holes. The number of players who make the cut depends on the tournament rules – in a typical PGA Tour event, the top 65 (formerly the top 70) professionals (plus ties) after 36 holes. Any player who returns a score higher than the cut mark takes no further part in the tournament.

Tournaments may also employ another cut after 54 holes if a large number of players make the 36-hole cut. Players missing this cut are designated as &quot;made cut, did not finish&quot; (MDF). The PGA Tour employed a secondary cut prior to reducing the cut line to the top 65 for the 2020–21 season.

===Playoff===

One of the most common methods for settling ties is by means of a playoff, whereby those players who have tied for the lead replay a set number of holes. If still tied after those holes, then further sudden-death holes may also be played until a winner emerges.

Ties in professional golf are generally settled by means of a playoff. Different tournaments have various formats for their playoffs, ranging from another full round, as employed in the U.S. Open, through to a three- or four-hole playoff as used in the PGA Championship and the Open Championship (British Open), to straightforward sudden death, which is used in most tournaments including the Masters Tournament and all other regular PGA Tour and European Tour events. In the longer playoff formats, if at least two players remain tied after such a playoff, then play generally continues in sudden-death format.

====Count back====
One method of breaking ties commonly used in amateur competitions, especially when a playoff is not practical, and used in professional tournaments to seed players in knockout rounds (such as the World Super 6 in Perth, Australia) is a scorecard &quot;count back&quot;, whereby the player with the lowest cumulative score over the last 18, 9, 6, 3, or 1 hole(s) is declared the winner.

<doc id="839643" wikidata="Q698102" url="?curid=839643" title="William Stuart-Houston">
<text>William Patrick Stuart-Houston (born William Patrick Hitler; 12 March 1911 – 14 July 1987) was a British-American entrepreneur and the half-nephew of Adolf Hitler. Born and raised in the Toxteth area of Liverpool to Adolf&#x27;s half-brother Alois Hitler Jr. and his Irish wife Bridget Dowling, he later relocated to Germany to work for his half-uncle before returning back to London and later emigrating to the United States, where he received American citizenship (in addition to his British citizenship) and ended up serving in the United States Navy against his half-uncle and Nazi Germany during World War II, changing his surname after the war.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stuart-Houston was born William Patrick Hitler in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, England on 12 March 1911 to an Austrian born father Alois Hitler Jr. and his Irish wife Bridget Dowling. His father was the older half-brother of Adolf Hitler. The couple met in Dublin when Alois was living there during 1909 and was working as a kitchen porter at Dublin&#x27;s Shelbourne Hotel ; they married in London&#x27;s Marylebone district in 1910 and relocated to Liverpool. The family lived in a flat at 102 Upper Stanhope Street, which was later destroyed during the last German air raid of the Liverpool Blitz on 10 January 1942. Dowling wrote a manuscript titled &quot;My Brother-in-Law Adolf&quot;, in which she claimed that Adolf had lived in Liverpool with her from November 1912 to April 1913 to avoid conscription in Austria. The book is largely considered a work of fiction, as Adolf was residing in the Meldemannstraße dormitory in Vienna at the time.

Alois attempted to make money by managing a small restaurant in Dale Street, a boarding house on Parliament Street and a hotel on Mount Pleasant, all of which failed. In 1914, Alois left Bridget and William for a gambling tour of Europe. He later returned to Germany. Unable to rejoin his family due to the outbreak of World War I, he abandoned them, leaving William to be brought up only by his mother in North London. William would also be supported by his mother&#x27;s family in Ireland. Alois remarried bigamously, but wrote to Bridget during the mid-1920s to ask her to send William to Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic for a visit. She finally agreed in 1929, when William was 18. By this time, Alois had another son named Heinz with his German wife. Alois and his wife also adopted a daughter who his name was never revealed. Heinz, in contrast to William, became a committed Nazi, joined the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, and died in Soviet captivity in 1942. When William was 18 he and his mother moved to London and settled in Highgate and rented a house located on 26 Priory Gardens. William joined an apprenticeship as an accountant in an accounting firm called Benham and Sons, however after Hitler rose to power, William was fired because of his surname.

===Nazi Germany===
In 1933, encouraged by his mother, William travelled to what had become Nazi Germany in an attempt to make money and benefit from his half-uncle&#x27;s growing power. Adolf, who was now chancellor, found him a job at the &quot;Reichskreditbank&quot; in Berlin, a job that he held for most of the 1930s. He later worked at the Opel automobile factory as a car salesman, however he was dissatisfied with these jobs. Hitler also did not trust William because of the way he acting in public and how he was fooling around and taking advantage of his power, so he sent spies to watch him. William then got arrested in a cafe one day, and when he showed his ID, the officers did not believe that he was related to Hitler and sent to a prison in Lichterfelde, he was finally released because of the British Embassy. Hitler would also not allow William to send money to his mother in England who was struggling and needed money. William then asked his half-uncle for a better job, writing to him with blackmail threats of selling embarrassing stories about the family to the newspapers unless his &quot;personal circumstances&quot; improved. Hitler actually listened and had Williams salary doubled.

In 1938, Adolf asked William to relinquish his British citizenship in exchange for a high-ranking job. Suspecting a trap, William fled Nazi Germany and returned back to England. He again tried to blackmail his uncle with threats. This time, William threatened to tell the press that Adolf&#x27;s alleged paternal grandfather was actually a Jewish merchant. He returned to London, where he wrote the article &quot;Why I Hate My Uncle&quot; for &quot;Look&quot; magazine.

===Emigration to the United States===

In January 1939, the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst brought William and his mother to the United States for a lecture tour. He and his mother were stranded when World War II began. After making a special request to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, William was eventually approved to join the United States Navy in 1944; he relocated to the Sunnyside neighborhood of Queens, New York. William was drafted into the United States Navy during World War II as a pharmacist&#x27;s mate (a designation later changed to hospital corpsman) until he was discharged in 1947. On reporting for duty, the induction officer asked his name. He replied, &quot;Hitler.&quot; Thinking he was joking, the officer replied, &quot;Glad to see you, Hitler. My name&#x27;s Hess.&quot; It is claimed William was wounded in action during the war and awarded the Purple Heart.

===Later life===
After being discharged from the Navy, William changed his surname to &quot;Stuart-Houston&quot;. In 1947, he married Phyllis Jean-Jacques, who had been born in Germany in the mid-1920s. After their relationship began, William and Phyllis, along with Bridget, tried to live a life of anonymity in the United States. They moved to Patchogue, New York, where William used his medical training to establish a business that analyzed blood samples for hospitals. His laboratory, which he called Brookhaven Laboratories, was located in his home, a two-story clapboard house at 71 Silver Street.

Stuart-Houston and his wife had four sons: Alexander Adolf (b. 1949), Louis (b. 1951), Howard Ronald (1957–1989), and Brian William (b. 1965). None of his sons have had children of their own. In his 2001 book &quot;The Last of the Hitlers&quot;, journalist David Gardner speculated that the four brothers had made a verbal pact not to sire children. Eldest son Alexander denied this claim, stating that before his death Howard Ronald had been engaged and intending to have children, while another brother had been engaged once, but family notoriety had destroyed the relationship. Alexander works as a social worker, the second oldest child Louis and the youngest child Brian William run a landscaping business together. His third son, Howard Ronald Stuart-Houston, worked as a Special Agent with the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and died in a car accident on September 14, 1989 while driving on Route 25, New York, near to Dietz Avenue, in a head-on collision, while en route to subpoena for a money laundering investigation. Special Agent Stuart-Houston was subsequently buried in Coram, New York. 

William Patrick Stuart-Houston died in Patchogue on 14 July 1987. He was buried next to his mother&#x27;s at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Coram, New York. His widow, Phyllis, died in 2004.

==In the media==
The family&#x27;s story and Bridget&#x27;s memoirs were first published by Michael Unger in the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; in 1973. Unger also edited Bridget Dowling&#x27;s memoirs, which were first published as &quot;The Memoirs of Bridget Hitler&quot; in 1979; a completely updated version, titled &quot;The Hitlers of Liverpool&quot;, was published in 2011.

Beryl Bainbridge&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Young Adolf&quot; depicts the 23-year-old Adolf Hitler&#x27;s alleged 1912–13 visit to his Liverpool relatives. Bainbridge adapted the story into a play as &quot;The Journal of Bridget Hitler&quot; with director Philip Saville, which was broadcast as a &quot;Playhouse&quot; (BBC 2) in 1981.

Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell&#x27;s 1989 comic book &quot;The New Adventures of Hitler&quot; is likewise based on the alleged Liverpool visit.

In October 2005, The History Channel broadcast a one-hour documentary titled &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Family&quot;, in which William Patrick Hitler is described along with other relatives of Adolf Hitler.

Netflix aired a documentary titled &quot;The Pact: Le serment des Hitler&quot; (2014), directed by Emmanuel Amara, which was billed as a retracing of the life of Hitler, and an exploration of what became of the Hitler family line.

Stuart-Houston was mentioned in the second episode of the 2015-16 season of the British panel show QI which was called &quot;Military Matters&quot; and aired on 23 October 2015.

William Patrick Hitler was portrayed in the sketch &quot;Willy Hitler Fights the Germans&quot; in the 19 June 2018 episode of the American Comedy Central television series &quot;Drunk History&quot;, which aired as the eighth episode of that show&#x27;s fifth season.

<doc id="839646" wikidata="Q1013437" url="?curid=839646" title="Odawara Castle">
<text>is a reconstructed Japanese castle in the city of Odawara in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

The current donjon (keep) was constructed out of reinforced concrete in 1960 on a stone foundation of the former donjon, torn down from 1870–1872 during the Meiji Period. There has been fortifications at or around the castle&#x27;s current site since the Kamakura Period (1185–1333).

The reconstructed Odawara Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.

==History==
Odawara was a stronghold of the Doi clan during the Kamakura period, and a fortified residence built by their collateral branch, the Kobayakawa clan, stood on the approximate site of the present castle. After the Uesugi Zenshū Revolt of 1416, Odawara came under the control of the Omori clan of Suruga. They were in turn defeated by Ise Moritoki of Izu, founder of the Odawara Hōjō clan in 1495. Five generations of the Odawara Hōjō clan improved and expanded on the fortifications of Odawara Castle as the center of their domains, which encompassed most of the Kantō region.

During the Sengoku period, Odawara Castle had very strong defenses, as it was situated on a hill, surrounded by moats with water on the low side, and dry ditches on the hill side, with banks, walls and cliffs located all around the castle, enabling the defenders to repel attacks by Uesugi Kenshin in 1561 and Takeda Shingen in 1569. In 1587, the defences of the castle were greatly expanded by the Odawara Hōjō in anticipation of the coming conflict with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, during the Battle of Odawara in 1590, Hideyoshi forced the surrender of the Odawara Hōjō without storming the castle through a combination of a three-month siege and bluff. After ordering most of the fortifications destroyed, he awarded the holdings of the Odawara Hōjō to his leading general Tokugawa Ieyasu.

===Edo period Odawara Castle===
After Ieyasu completed Edo Castle, he turned the site of Odawara Castle over to one of his senior retainers, Ōkubo Tadayo, who reconstructed the castle in its present form on a considerably reduced scale, with the entire castle fitting inside what was once the third bailey of the Sengoku period Hōjō castle . However, his successor Ōkubo Takachika was dispossessed by the shogunate in 1614. From 1619-1623, the castle was assigned to Abe Masatsugu. After 1623, Odawara Domain reverted to &quot;tenryō&quot; status and a palace was constructed in the inner bailey to serve as a retirement home of Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada; however, Hidetada chose to remain in Edo during this retirement. On his death, Odawara Domain was revived as an 85,000 &quot;koku&quot; holding for Inaba Masakatsu, the eldest son of Kasuga no Tsubone, the wet nurse to Shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu. Iemitsu visited Odawara Castle in 1634. Under the Inaba clan, the castle was extensively renovated. In 1686, the Inaba were transferred, and the Ōkubo clan returned to Odawara, with the domain expanded in &quot;kokudaka&quot; to 103,000 &quot;koku&quot;. The castle suffered great damage during the 1703 Genroku earthquake, which destroyed most of the castle structures. The donjon was restored by 1706, but the rest of the castle took until 1721. Extensive damage occurred again during the 1782 Tenmei earthquake and once more during the 1853 Kaei earthquake. During the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration, Ōkubo Tadanori permitted the pro-Imperial forces of the Satchō Alliance to pass through Odawara on their way to Edo without opposition.

===Odawara Castle in the modern era===
The new Meiji government ordered the destruction of all former feudal fortifications, and in compliance with this directive, all structures of Odawara Castle were pulled down from 1870–1872. In 1893, the stone base of the former donjon become the foundation for a Shinto shrine, the Ōkubo Jinja, dedicated to the spirits of the generations of Ōkubo daimyō. In 1901, the Odawara Imperial Villa was constructed within the site of the former inner and second bailies. The Imperial Villa was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which also caused many of the stone facing on the castle ramparts to collapse. Repair work was made to the stone walls from 1930–1931, but with very poor workmanship. In 1934, two of the remaining &quot;yagura&quot; (which had been destroyed in the 1923 earthquake) were restored, but on a half-scale.

In 1938, the castle site was proclaimed a National Historic Site, with the area under historic preservation restrictions expanded in 1959, and again in 1976 based on further archaeological investigations.

In 1950, repairs were made to the stone base of the former donjon, which had been in ruins since the Great Kantō earthquake, and the area was made into the Odawara Castle Park, which included an art museum, local history museum, city library, amusement park and zoo. The three-tiered, five-storied donjon, the top floor of which is an observatory, was rebuilt in 1960 out of reinforced concrete to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the proclamation of Odawara as a city. However, the reconstructed donjon is not historically accurate, as the observation deck was added at the insistence of the Odawara City tourism authorities. Plans have been discussed since the late 1960s on a more accurate restoration of the central castle grounds to its late Edo period format. These plans resulted in the reconstruction of the in 1971, the in 1997, and the in 2009. The castle tower was remodelled from July 2015 until April 2016 to improve earthquake resistance and to modernise its exhibits. Odawara City government donated all entry fees on the day of the re-opening to Kumamoto City government, to be put towards repairs to Kumamoto Castle that was damaged in the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.

The reconstructed Odawara Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.

<doc id="839648" wikidata="Q624638" url="?curid=839648" title="Arachosia">
<text>Arachosia (; ), or Harauvatis ( ), was a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire. Mainly centred around the Arghandab River, a tributary of the Helmand River, it extended as far east as the Indus River. The satrapy&#x27;s Persian-language name is the etymological equivalent of in Vedic Sanskrit. In Greek, the satrapy&#x27;s name was derived from , the Greek-language name for the Arghandab River. Around 330 BCE, Alexander the Great commissioned the building of Alexandria Arachosia as Arachosia&#x27;s new capital city under the Macedonian Empire. It was built on top of an earlier Persian military fortress after Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Persia, and is the site of today&#x27;s Kandahar in Afghanistan.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Arachosia&quot; is the Latinized form of Greek (&quot;Arachōsíā&quot;). &quot;The same region appears in the Avestan &quot;Vidēvdāt&quot; (1.12) under the indigenous dialect form 𐬵𐬀𐬭𐬀𐬓𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬍 - (whose &quot;-axva-&quot; is typical non-Avestan).&quot; In Old Persian inscriptions, the region is referred to as , written &quot;h(a)-r(a)-u-v(a)-t-i&quot;. This form is the &quot;etymological equivalent&quot; of Vedic Sanskrit -, the name of a river literally meaning &quot;rich in waters/lakes&quot; and derived from &quot;sáras-&quot; &quot;lake, pond.&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Aredvi Sura Anahita).

&quot;Arachosia&quot; was named after the name of a river that runs through it, known in ancient Greek as the &quot;Arachōtós&quot; and today as the Arghandab River, a left-bank tributary of the Helmand River.

==Geography==
Arachosia bordered on Drangiana to the west, on the Paropamisadae to the north, Hindush to the east, and Gedrosia to the south. Isidore and Ptolemy (6.20.4-5) each provide a list of cities in Arachosia, among them (yet another) Alexandria, which lay on the river Arachotus. This city is frequently misidentified with present-day Kandahar in Afghanistan, the name of which was thought to be derived (via &quot;Iskanderiya&quot;) from &quot;Alexandria&quot;, reflecting a connection to Alexander the Great&#x27;s visit to the city on his campaign towards India. But a recent discovery of an inscription on a clay tablet has provided proof that &#x27;Kandahar&#x27; was already a city that traded actively with Persia well before Alexander&#x27;s time. Isidore, Strabo (11.8.9) and Pliny (6.61) also refer to the city as &quot;metropolis of Arachosia.&quot;

In his list, Ptolemy also refers to a city named Arachotus ( ; ) or Arachoti (acc. to Strabo), which was the earlier capital of the land. Pliny the Elder and Stephen of Byzantium mention that its original name was Cophen (Κωφήν). Hsuan Tsang refers to the name as &quot;Kaofu&quot;. This city is identified today with Arghandab which lies northwest of present-day Kandahar.

==History==

The region is first referred to in the Achaemenid-era Elamite Persepolis fortification tablets. It appears again in the Old Persian, Akkadian and Aramaic inscriptions of Darius I and Xerxes I among lists of subject peoples and countries. It is subsequently also identified as the source of the ivory used in Darius&#x27; palace at Susa. In the Behistun inscription (DB 3.54-76), the King recounts that a Persian was thrice defeated by the Achaemenid governor of Arachosia, Vivana, who so ensured that the province remained under Darius&#x27; control. It has been suggested that this &quot;strategically unintelligible engagement&quot; was ventured by the rebel because &quot;there were close relations between Persia and Arachosia concerning the Zoroastrian faith.&quot;
The chronologically next reference to Arachosia comes from the Greeks and Romans, who record that under Darius III the Arachosians and Drangians were under the command of a governor who, together with the army of the Bactrian governor, contrived a plot of the Arachosians against Alexander (Curtius Rufus 8.13.3). Following Alexander&#x27;s conquest of the Achaemenids, the Macedonian appointed his generals as governors (Arrian 3.28.1, 5.6.2; Curtius Rufus 7.3.5; Plutarch, Eumenes 19.3; Polyaenus 4.6.15; Diodorus 18.3.3; Orosius 3.23.1 3; Justin 13.4.22).
In 316 BCE Antigonus I Monophthalmus sent most of the elite Argyraspides, a veteran Macedonian corps with over forty years experience, to Arachosia to protect the Eastern frontier with India. However they were sent with the order to Sibyrtius, the Macedonian satrap of Arachosia, to dispatch them by small groups of two or three to dangerous missions so that their numbers would rapidly dwindle and remove them as a military threat to his power.

Following the Wars of the Diadochi, the region became part of the Seleucid Empire, which traded it to the Mauryan Empire in 305 BCE as part of an alliance. The Shunga dynasty overthrew the Mauryans in 185 BC, but shortly afterwards lost Arachosia to the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. It then became part of the break-away Indo-Greek Kingdom in the mid 2nd century BCE. Indo-Scythians expelled the Indo-Greeks by the mid 1st century BCE, but lost the region to the Arsacids and Indo-Parthians. At what time (and in what form) Parthian rule over Arachosia was reestablished cannot be determined with any authenticity. From Isidore 19 it is certain that a part (perhaps only a little) of the region was under Arsacid rule in the 1st century CE, and that the Parthians called it &quot;Indikē Leukē&quot;, &quot;White India.&quot;

The Kushans captured Arachosia from the Indo-Parthians and ruled the region until around 230 CE, when they were defeated by the Sassanids, the second Persian Empire, after which the Kushans were replaced by Sassanid vassals known as the Kushanshas or Indo-Sassanids. In 420 CE the Kushanshas were driven out of present Afghanistan by the Chionites, who established the Kidarite Kingdom. The Kidarites were replaced in the 460s CE by the Hephthalites, who were defeated in 565 CE by a coalition of Persian and Turkish armies. Arachosia became part of the surviving Kushano-Hephthalite Kingdoms of Kapisa, then Kabul, before coming under attack from the Moslem Arabs. These kingdoms were at first vassals of Sassanids. Around 870 CE the Kushano-Hephthalites (aka Turkshahi Dynasty) was replaced by the Saffarids, then the Samanid Empire and Muslim Turkish Ghaznavids in the early 11th century CE.

Arab geographers referred to the region (or parts of it) as &#x27;Arokhaj&#x27;, &#x27;Rokhaj&#x27;, &#x27;Rohkaj&#x27; or simply &#x27;Roh&#x27;.

==Inhabitants==

The inhabitants of Arachosia were Iranian peoples, and were referred to as &quot;Arachosians&quot; or &quot;Arachoti&quot;. They were called &quot;Pactyans&quot; in reference to their individual ethnicity, and that name may have been in reference to the modern-day ethnic group known as the Pashtuns.

Isidore of Charax, in his 1st-century CE &quot;Parthian stations&quot; itinerary, described an &quot;Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia&quot;, which he said was still Greek even at such a late time:
A theory of Croatian origin traces the origin of the Croats to the area of Arachosia. This connection was at first drawn due to the similarity of Croatian (Croatia – Croatian: Hrvatska, Croats – Croatian: Hrvati / Čakavian dialect: Harvati / Kajkavian dialect: Horvati) and Arachosian name, but other researches indicate that there are also linguistic, cultural, agrobiological and genetic ties. Since Croatia became an independent state in 1991, the Iranian theory gained more popularity, and many scientific papers and books have been published.

<text>Cointreau (, , ) is a brand of orange-flavoured triple sec liqueur produced in Saint-Barthélemy-d&#x27;Anjou, France. It is consumed as an apéritif and digestif, and is a component of several well-known cocktails. It was originally called Curaçao Blanco Triple Sec. Despite the orange bottle, Cointreau is colourless. Cointreau also produces Cointreau Noir, a blend of 70% Cointreau and 30% cognac from the House of Rémy Martin. Though the term &quot;Cointreau&quot; is usually used to refer to the triple sec liqueur itself, the specific term &quot;Cointreau L&#x27;Unique&quot; may be used to distinguish it from related products, such as the aforementioned Cointreau Noir. 

== Production ==
Cointreau Distillery was set up in 1849 by Adolphe Cointreau, a confectioner, and his brother Édouard-Jean Cointreau. Their first success was with the cherry liqueur Guignolet, but they also found success when they blended sweet and bitter orange peels and pure alcohol from sugar beets. The first bottles of Cointreau were sold in 1875. An estimated 13 million bottles are sold each year, in more than 150 countries. Ninety percent of production is exported. Cointreau &amp; Cie SA was family-owned until 1990, when it merged with Rémy Martin to form Rémy Cointreau, now a publicly traded company.

The production methods and recipe are a family secret, but public tours of the facility are offered. Photography is restricted in many areas to protect the production process from being copied.

== Cocktails ==
In addition to being consumed neat (or often on ice), Cointreau is used in many popular cocktails.
The official IBA recipes for the margarita, Corpse Reviver #2, and the cosmopolitan include Cointreau. When mixed with water, Cointreau exhibits the Ouzo effect.

== Publicity ==
In the 1980s, Avirex, now Cockpit USA, issued an A-2 limited-edition leather flight jacket featuring Cointreau Original Margarita nose art on the back of the jacket. In early 2008, the burlesque entertainer Dita Von Teese became the new face of Cointreau&#x27;s &quot;Be Cointreauversial&quot; advertising and marketing campaign, a campaign created in 2003 by the New York advertising agency KraftWorks.

<text>Gustav Adolf Franz Brand (14 November 1874 – 2 February 1945) was a German writer, egoist anarchist, and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.

==Early life==
Adolf Brand was born on 14 November 1874 in Berlin, which was then part of the German Empire. He grew up in Wilhemshagen. His father was a blacksmith.

==Career==

He became a school teacher briefly before establishing a publishing firm and producing a German homosexual periodical, &quot;Der Eigene&quot; (&quot;The Unique&quot;) in 1896. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world, and ran until 1931. The name was taken from writings of egoist philosopher Max Stirner, who had greatly influenced the young Brand, and refers to Stirner&#x27;s concept of &quot;self-ownership&quot; of the individual. Der Eigene concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have had an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, John Henry Mackay (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus and Sascha Schneider. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. Brand&#x27;s writings, together with those of other contributors to &quot;Der Eigene,&quot; aimed at a revival of Greek pederasty as a cultural model for modern homosexuality.

In 1899/1900 Brand published Elisar von Kupffer&#x27;s (1872–1942) influential anthology of homoerotic literature, &quot;Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur&quot;. The work was reprinted in 1995.

In 1900, he was sentenced to a year in prison for insulting Center Party leader Ernst Lieber. In 1903, he was incarcerated for two months due to the sexual content published in &quot;Der Eigene&quot;. 

Brand became involved in Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (the first public homosexual rights organization), until there was a split in 1903. 

That year, Brand formed &quot;Gemeinschaft der Eigenen&quot; with the scientist (and principal theorist) Benedict Friedlaender and Wilhelm Jansen. The GdE met weekly at Brand&#x27;s house. To this new group, male-male love, in particular that of an older man for a youth, was viewed as a simple aspect of virile manliness available to all men; they rejected the medical theories of doctors such as Magnus Hirschfeld who found that a gay man was a certain type of person, the intermediate sex. The GdE was a sort of scouting movement that echoed the warrior creed of Sparta and the ideals of pederasty in Ancient Greece, and the ideas on pedagogic eros of Gustav Wyneken. The GdE was heavily involved with camping and trekking. They occasionally practised nudism – the latter then common as part of the Nacktkultur (&#x27;culture of nudity&#x27;) sweeping Germany. In the 1920s this would develop into the Freikörperkultur under Adolf Koch.

The &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; opposed Hirschfeld and the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee&#x27;s stance that homosexuality existed on a continuum with femininity. Brand and the &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; instead believed that homosexuality was the epitome of manliness and brotherly love, to be expressed by any man. The group tended towards elitism who based their ideas of attractiveness around Germanic racial purity. Their views towards women were often misogynistic. The &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; followed a strategy of outing high-visibility homosexuals. They termed this strategy the &quot;path over corpses&quot; ().

The GdE was similar to other such groups in Germany at the time, such as the Wandervogel. Wilhelm Jansen, co-founder of the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen, was one of the chief financial supporters of the Wandervogel and also a leader in it.

The writings and theories of the romantic anarchist John Henry Mackay (1864–1933) had a significant influence on the GdE from 1906. Mackay had lived in Berlin for a decade and had become a friend of Friedlaender, who did not share the anarchist leanings of Brand and Mackay, favoring instead the thinking on &#x27;natural rights&#x27; and land reform, then current in Germany.

Brand was imprisoned multiple times for his actions. Even in court, he unapologetically identified with his bisexuality.

== Later life ==

In the early 1930s, Brand retreated from activism, married a woman, and retired.

== Death ==

He and his wife were killed by an Allied bomb in Berlin-Rahnsdorf on 2 February 1945. He was 70 years old. During 1945 civilian areas of Berlin were bombed intensely by U.S. led allied forces.

<text>Gedrosia (; ) is the Hellenized name of the part of coastal Balochistan that roughly corresponds to today&#x27;s Makran. In books about Alexander the Great and his successors, the area referred to as Gedrosia runs from the Indus River to the north-eastern edge of the Strait of Hormuz. It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria, Arachosia and Drangiana, to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India. The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar or Gwatar as there are two towns by that name and three bays with similar names (Gwadar East Bay, Gwadar West Bay and Gwatar Bay) in central Makran.

==Geography==
Pliny the Elder while explaining the extent of India included four satrapies Arachosia, Gedrosia, Aria and Parapanisidae as western borders of India.
India within the Ganges is bounded on the west by the Paropanisadai, Arakhosia, and Gedrosia along their eastern sides; on the north by Mount Imaos, which is situated near the Sogdiaioi and Sakai; on the east by the river Ganges; and on the south and again on the west by a part of the Indian Ocean.&lt;br&gt;
Ptolemy, Geography 7:1
==People==
According to Arrian, Nearchus mentions a race called Ichthyophagi (&quot;fish-eaters&quot;) as inhabiting the barren shores of the Gwadar and Pasni districts in Makrān. During the homeward march of Alexander the Great, his admiral, Nearchus led a fleet in Arabian Sea along the Makrān coast and recorded that the area was dry and mountainous, inhabited by the &quot;Ichthyophagoi&quot; or &quot;Fish-Eaters&quot;. They are also identified on the 4th century Peutinger Map, as a people of the Baluchistan coast. The existence of such tribes was confirmed by Sir Richard F Burton.

Another group of people named as Oreitans were mentioned inhabiting modern Lasbela District in Balochistan province of Pakistan. Alexander the Great crossed Hub River through Lasbela on his way back to Babylon after his campaigns in Northwestern India. Alexander mentions the river name as Arabius, and local people as Oreitans.

== History ==
===Gedrosia (satrapy)===

Gedrosia is a dry, mountainous country along the northwestern shores of the Indian Ocean. It was occupied in the Bronze Age by people who settled in the few oases in the region. Other people settled on the coast and became known in Greek as Ichthyophagi. It was conquered by Cyrus the Great or Darius the Great. although information about his campaign is comparatively late. The capital of Gedrosia was Pura, which is probably identical to modern Bampur, forty kilometers west of Irânshahr.

Several scholars have argued that the Persian satrapy Maka is identical to Gedrosia (which is a Greek name). One argument is the similarity of the name Maka to the modern name Makran, a part of Pakistan and Iran that is situated a bit more to the east. However, it is more likely that Maka is to be sought in modern Oman, which was called Maketa in Antiquity.

===Alexander&#x27;s campaign===
Gedrosia became famous in Europe when the Macedonian king Alexander the Great tried to cross the Gedrosian desert and lost one third of his men.

Following his army&#x27;s refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BCE, Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon. Upon reaching the Ocean, Alexander divided his forces in half, sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus. The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert, inland from the ocean. Throughout the 60-day march through the desert, Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers, in addition to countless livestock, camp followers, and most of his baggage train. Some historians say he lost three-quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way. However, this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march, which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers.

There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander&#x27;s decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast. The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River. The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the actions of Cyrus the Great, who had failed to cross the desert.

After the death of Alexander, this region became part of the holdings of Seleucus, who held Aria, Arachosia, and Gandhara, in addition to Gedrosia.

===Mauryan Empire===
The territories, known collectively as Ariyana were later lost to the Mauryan Empire of ancient India under the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. Gedrosia, along with Saurashtra, were regions in ancient India that formed an important part of the Maurya Empire, before being attacked by Indo-Greeks from the west.

<text>The bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), also known as the campanero or anvil-bird, is a passerine bird which occurs in northern South America. The male is about long with white plumage apart from a brown head and black wings. At his throat hang several black, unfeathered wattles. The female is a little smaller with olive-green head and upper parts, yellow underparts streaked with green and a yellow vent area. The male has a loud, repeated metallic hammering call, as well as various other vocalisations.

There are two subspecies, the nominate subspecies is only found in northeastern Brazil, while the other subspecies occurs in Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana, eastern Bolivia and northern Brazil. This bird is found in moist tropical forests where it feeds mainly on fruit and berries which are picked on the wing. The nest is a rather flimsy mass of stems and slender twigs built far out on a branch of an isolated tree. A single buff-coloured egg is laid and incubated solely by the female.

==Description==
Like other cotingas, the bearded bellbird has a broad hooked-tipped bill, rounded wings, strong legs and a striking appearance. The male is approx 28 cm 11 in long, and weighs . His plumage is white or greyish-white apart from the black wings and warm brown head. He sports a &quot;beard&quot; of un-feathered, black stringy wattles.

The female is smaller, at approx. and . Her upperparts are olive-green (duskier on the head), most of the underparts are yellow streaked with green, and the vent is pure yellow. She lacks the facial wattles (&quot;beard&quot;). Both sexes have dark eyes, a black bill and grey to black legs.

The males&#x27; advertising calls are a very loud dull &quot;Bock&quot; repeated every few seconds and a somewhat less loud, metallic hammering &quot;tonk-tonk-tonk-tonk&quot;. It sounds like a hammer rapidly hitting an anvil and is repeated 20–30 times. Additionally, a number of regional calls are known, e.g. an unmusical, almost hissing, &quot;bisset&quot; in southern Venezuela and a disyllabic &quot;teek-terong&quot; in northern Venezuela. Apparently, the last mentioned call is no longer heard in Trinidad. The female is essentially silent.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bearded bellbird is native to Venezuela (as well as adjacent parts of Colombia and Guyana), Trinidad and Tobago and northeastern Brazil, where it occurs in humid forests and woodland. It is mainly resident, but some populations take part in altitudinal migrations; breeding at altitudes of up to and spending the non-breeding season in the lowlands. There are two subspecies; the nominate taxon, &quot;P. a. averano&quot;, in northeastern Brazil and &quot;P. a. carnobarba&quot; in Venezuela, Trinidad, extreme northeastern Colombia, western Guyana and far northern Brazil. It is a localised and uncommon bird in Venezuela, but is fairly common in Trinidad. The nominate Brazilian race is relatively rare due to extensive habitat destruction in its range and heavy trapping for the cagebird trade, and as such is considered &quot;vulnerable&quot; by Brazilian environmental authority (IBAMA).

==Ecology==
These arboreal bellbirds feeds entirely on fruit and berries, mainly taken on the wing. Lauraceae and Burseraceae are particularly favoured (as well as Araliaceae and Melastomataceae), and the young are fed regurgitated Lauraceae by the female.

The flimsy nest of twigs is built by the female and usually placed in the outer branches of a tree. The nests are not located in the jungle, but in free-standing trees in semi-cleared areas, probably to reduce the risk from the many effective predators of nests in the jungle such as monkeys, toucans and snakes.

The single brown-mottled, light tan egg is incubated entirely by the female, leaving the polygamous male free to spend much of his time advertising with his distinctive songs. Laying season varies over its range; April-Nov in Trinidad and May-Sep in N. Venezuela. The first recorded egg was discovered near Cumaca, Trinidad, in the mid-1950s.

<text>Nedumangad is a municipal town in the Thiruvananthapuram district in the Indian state of Kerala. It is the headquarters of Nedumangad Tehsil and Nedumangad Revenue Division. It is a suburb of the extended metropolitan region of Thiruvananthapuram. It is located around to the north-east of Thiruvananthapuram on the State Highway 2. It is an important commercial center in the district. It is a growing commercial and educational hub and all important government institutions are situated in the town. The Nedumangadu market has significance in southern Kerala.
It is an important centre for commercial trade in hill products such as pepper and rubber. A wholesale market set up by the Department of Agriculture (with the assistance of the European Union) is also situated there.

==History==
Nedumangad panchayat was formed in 1936. It was one among the four Panchayats sanctioned by Sir C.P.Ramaswamy Iyer (Diwan-Thiruvithamcore). The others were Paravur, Boothapandi and Perumbavoor. In 1978 Nedumangad Municipality was established.

===Nedumangad Chantha Revolt===

Nedumangad was a main center of trade in Thiruvananthapuram. Lower caste people were not allowed to enter in the trade markets (Chantha) of Nedumangad and items brought by them from their farms have to be placed outside and used to get a lower price. A group of people under the leadership of Ayyankali questioned this social injustice which resulted in a great revolt and fought back their rights to enter and sell the goods of lower caste people in Nedumangad market and the trade markets nearby. This is known as Nedumangad Chantha revolt.

==Behind the name Nedumangad==
There are still many opinions as to how the taluk Nedumangad got its name. It is said that there is a fruit called Neduvan and that it is the land of a local ruler named Neduvan. According to some historical sources, the old name of Nedumangad was Ilavallur Nadu.

<text>The genus Spilogale includes all skunks commonly known as spotted skunks. Currently, there are four accepted extant species: &quot;S. gracilis&quot;, &quot;S. putorius&quot;, &quot;S. pygmaea&quot;, and &quot;S. angustifrons&quot;. New research, however, proposes that there may be up to seven.

==Extant species==
In the past, anywhere between two and fourteen species of &quot;Spilogale&quot; have been recognized, but today most authorities accept a four species model (seen below). A 2021 DNA analysis of 203 specimens from across their known range suggests that there may be as many as seven distinct species in the genus, some cryptic.

==Description==
Mammalogists consider &quot;S. gracilis&quot; and &quot;S. putorius&quot; different species because of differences in reproductive patterns, reproductive morphology, and chromosomal variation. However, interbreeding has never been disproved. The name &quot;Spilogale&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;spilo&quot;, which means &quot;spotted&quot;, and gale, which means &quot;weasel&quot;. &quot;Putorius&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;fetid odor&quot;. &quot;Gracilis&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;slender&quot;. Several other names attributed to &quot;S. putorius&quot; include: civet cat, polecat, hydrophobian skunk, phoby skunk, phoby cat, tree skunk, weasel skunk, black marten, little spotted skunk, four-lined skunk, four-striped skunk, and sachet kitty.

==Distribution and habitat==

===Range===
The western spotted skunk (&quot;Spilogale gracilis&quot;) can be found west of the Continental Divide from southern British Columbia to Central America, as well as in some parts of Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and western Texas. Eastward, its range borders that of the eastern spotted skunk (&quot;Spilogale putorius&quot;). &quot;Spilogale gracilis&quot; generally occupies lowland areas but they are sometimes found at higher elevations (2600 m). Although the western spotted skunk is now recognized as &quot;S. gracilis&quot;, previously, skunks west of the Cascade Crest in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon were recognized as a distinct subspecies (&quot;S. p. latifrons&quot;).

&quot;Spilogale putorius&quot; is found throughout the central and southeastern United States, as well as northeastern Mexico. In Mississippi, &quot;S. putorius&quot; is found throughout the whole state, except for the northwestern corner by the Mississippi River. In the Great Plains, there has been an observed increase in the geographical range of these skunks, and the cause of this is thought to be a result of an increase in agriculture. This would lead to an increase in mice, which happen to be one of the primary prey for &quot;S. putorius&quot;.

===Habitat===
&quot;Spilogale&quot; usually like to reside in covered thickets, woods, riparian hardwood, shrubbery, and areas that are located near streams. However, &quot;S. putorius&quot; usually enjoy staying in rocky and woody habitats that have copious amounts of vegetation. These sly creatures prefer to dwell in a den or natural cavities such as stumps or hollow logs. Spotted skunks have been found to adjust well to a wide array of dry prairie ecosystems in shallow dens. They take on a negative relationship with elevation, particularly in regions such as the Northern and Southern Appalachians of the United States. Although they have very effective digging claws, they prefer to occupy dens that are made by gophers, wood rats, pocket gophers, striped skunks, or armadillos. They occupy dens that are positioned to be completely dark inside. &quot;Spilogale&quot; are very social creatures and frequently share dens with up to seven other skunks. Although skunks often live in this way, maternal dens are not open to non-maternal skunks.

==Biology==

===Reproduction===
Around the time of March, the males’ testes begin to enlarge and are most massive by late September. The increase in size is accompanied by a larger testosterone production. Similarly, a female begins to experience an increase in ovarian activity in March. &quot;Spilogale&quot; begin to mate during March as well. Implantation occurs approximately 14–16 days after mating. For the western spotted skunk, most copulations occur in late September and the beginning of October. Post copulation the zygotes are subject to normal cleavage but stop at the blastocyst stage, where they can remain in the uterus for roughly 6.5 months. After implantation, gestation lasts 30 days and between April and June their offspring are born. Although litter sizes vary considerably, the average litter size is about 5.5 and the gender ratio is 65 M: 35 F.

===Growth===

The newborn skunks are covered with fine hair that shows the adult color pattern. The eyes open between 30 and 32 days. The kits start solid food at about 42 days and are weaned at about two months. They are full grown and reach adult size at about four months. The males do not help in raising the young.

==Defenses==
Spotted skunks protect themselves by spraying a strong and unpleasant scent. Two glands on the sides of the anus release the odorous oil through nipples. When threatened, the skunk turns its body into a U-shape with the head and anus facing the attacker. Muscles around the nipples of the scent gland aim them, giving the skunk great accuracy on targets up to 15 feet away. As a warning before spraying, the skunk stamps its front feet, raises its tail, and hisses. They may warn with a unique &quot;hand stand&quot;—the back vertical and the tail waving.

The liquid is secreted via paired anal subcutaneous glands that are connected to the body through striated muscles. The odorous solution is emitted as an atomized spray that is nearly invisible or as streams of larger droplets.

Skunks store about 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the odorous oil and can quickly spray five times in row. It takes about one week to replenish the oil.

The secretion of the spotted skunks differs from that of the striped skunks. The two major thiols of the striped skunks, (E)-2-butene-1-thiol and 3-methyl-1-butanethiol are the major components in the secretion of the spotted skunks along with a third thiol, 2-phenylethanethiol.

Thioacetate derivatives of the three thiols are present in the spray of the striped skunks but not the spotted skunks. They are not as odoriferous as the thiols. Water hydrolysis converts them to the more potent thiols. This chemical conversion may be why pets that have been sprayed by skunks will have a faint &quot;skunky&quot; odor on damp evenings.

==Deodorizing==
Changing the thiols into compounds that have little or no odor can be done by oxidizing the thiols to sulfonic acids. Hydrogen peroxide and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) are mild enough to be used on people and animals but changes hair color.

Stronger oxidizing agents, like sodium hypochlorite solutions—liquid laundry bleach—are cheap and effective for deodorizing other materials.

==Diet==
Skunks are omnivorous and will eat small rodents, fruits, berries, birds, eggs, insects and larvae, lizards, snakes, and carrion. Their diet may vary with the seasons as food availability fluctuates. They have a keen sense of smell that helps them find grubs and other food. Their hearing is acute but they have poor vision.

==Life expectancy==
Spotted skunks can live 10 years in captivity, but in the wild, about half the skunks die after 1 or 2 years.

==Conservation==
The eastern spotted skunk, &quot;S. putorius&quot;, is a conservation concern. Management is hampered by an overall lack of information from surveying. During the 1940s, &quot;Spilogale&quot; populations seemingly crashed and the species is currently listed by various state agencies as endangered, threatened, or ‘of concern’ across much of its range.
The species &quot;S. pygmaea&quot; is endemic to the Mexican Pacific coast and is currently threatened. The tropical dry forest of western Mexico, where these skunks live, is a highly threatened ecosystem that has been placed on conservation priority. &quot;S. pygmaea&quot; is also the smallest carnivore native to Mexico as well as one of the smallest worldwide.

<text>The Forum Boarium (, ) was the cattle market or &quot;forum venalium&quot; of ancient Rome. It was located on a level piece of land near the Tiber between the Capitoline, the Palatine and Aventine hills. As the site of the original docks of Rome () and adjacent to the Pons Aemilius, the earliest stone bridge across the Tiber, the Forum Boarium experienced intense commercial activity.

==History==
The site was a religious centre housing the Temple of Hercules Victor, the Temple of Portunus (Temple of Fortuna Virilis), and the massive 6th or 5th century BC Ara Maxima. According to legend, when Hercules arrived in this area with Geryon’s oxen, he was robbed of these by the giant Cacus, who lived in a cave at the foot of the Aventine hill. After slaying the giant, Hercules was honoured as a god by the ancient dwellers of the Palatine hill, who are said to have dedicated an altar to him. The tufa stone core of this altar is housed inside the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.

The Forum Boarium was the site of the first gladiatorial contest at Rome which took place in 264 BC as part of aristocratic funerary ritual—a &quot;munus&quot; or funeral gift for the dead. Marcus and Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva put on a gladiatorial combat in honor of their deceased father with three pairs of gladiators.

In 215BC, four victims were buried alive by the Romans under the Forum Boarium as human sacrifices to placate the gods after a series of events were seen as portents to great disaster. In volume five of Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;, which was written about 200 years later, the Roman historian wrote: 

A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium. They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated, Marcus Claudius Marcellus sent from Ostia 1500 men who had been enrolled for service with the fleet to garrison Rome.

==Architecture==

The Temple of Hercules Victor (&quot;Hercules the Winner&quot;) or Hercules Olivarius (&quot;Hercules the Olive-Bearer) is a circular peristyle building dating from the 2nd century BC. It consists of a colonnade of Corinthian columns arranged in a concentric ring around the cylindrical cella, resting on a tuff foundation. These elements originally supported an architrave and roof which have disappeared. It is the earliest surviving marble building in Rome. For centuries, this was known as the Temple of Vesta.

The Temple of Portunus is a rectangular building built between 100 and 80 BC. It consists of a tetrastyle portico and cella mounted on a podium reached by a flight of steps. The four Ionic columns of the portico are free-standing, while the six columns on the long sides and four columns at the rear are engaged along the walls of the cella. It is built of tuff and travertine with a stucco surface. This temple was for centuries known as the Temple of Fortuna Virilis.

Sources claim the Forum was the site for placement of a statue by the sculptor Myron, which had been looted from Aegina. While the source mentions a cow, it may have been a statuary group of &quot;Theseus defeating the Minotaur&quot;, which was apt for a cattle market.

During the late period of the Western Roman Empire, the area became overtaken with shops. Both temples were deconsecrated and converted to Christian churches. Across the street is the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, housing the .

==Restoration==
Beginning in the late 1990s, a partnership between the and World Monuments Fund resulted in the conservation of both temples in the Forum Boarium. The project also included new landscaping for the site. However, the Arch of Janus is still unrestored.

<text>The Forum Holitorium or Olitorium (Latin for the &quot;Market of the Vegetable Sellers&quot;; ) is an archaeological area of Rome, Italy, on the slopes of the Capitoline Hill. It was located outside the Carmental Gate in the Campus Martius, crowded between the cattle market (Forum Boarium) and buildings located in the Circus Flaminius.

In ancient times it was the fruit and vegetable market, while the area of the adjacent Forum Boarium served as meat market. At its northern end were the temples of Bellona, goddess of war, and Apollo Medicus. It also included a sacred area with three small temples dedicated to Janus, Spes and Juno Sospita.

== The sacred area ==

The construction of the sacred area of the forum dates back to the Republican age, more precisely to the period between the first and the second Punic War. Subsequently, at the time of Caesar (1st century BC), it underwent renovations which involved the demolition of a fourth temple: it was built by Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul in 191 BC) next to the Temple of Janus and was demolished during the construction of the Theatre of Marcellus (then completed by Augustus). The temple was dedicated to the worship of Diana.

The staircases of the three temples were not aligned, which confirms the absence of uniform town-planning criteria during the Republican age. Their construction limited the area of the market, which previously might have extended up to the Tiber.

These temples are now part of the structure of the Basilica of San Nicola in Carcere, first attested in the 11th century .

=== Temple of Janus ===

The Temple of Janus was the one located on the right and the closest to the Theatre of Marcellus. Built by Gaius Duilius at the time of the First Punic War, it was restored in AD 17 by Tiberius.

It was a peripteros temple &quot;sine postìcum&quot; (with columns on three sides), with eight tuff (peperino) columns on the long sides and six on the front (hexastyle), covered with stucco and raised on a low podium with elegant shaping.
=== Temple of Spes ===
The Temple of Spes () was located on the left, in opposition to the Temple of Janus. It was built by Aulus Atilius Calatinus, at the time of the First Punic War as well; it was restored in 232 BC and rebuilt after the fire of 213 BC, which also destroyed the temples of Sant&#x27;Omobono Area; finally it was restored in AD 17 by Germanicus Julius Caesar.

It was a peripteros doric temple with six columns on the front and eleven on the long side; the columns were made of raw travertine and covered with stucco to simulate the appearance of marble. It measured in length and in width.

Six columns of the temple with their architrave still exist, incorporated in the left side of the church of San Nicola.

=== Temple of Juno Sospita ===

The temple of Juno Sospita was located between the temple of Spes and that of Janus: on its ruins, towards the end of the 11th century, the current church was founded.

Built around 195 BC by Gaius Cornelius Cethegus, it was a peripteros ionic temple, with six columns on the facade, three rows of columns on the front side and two on the back side. A travertine staircase, the same which is still used today to access the church, led to the pronaos of the temple. It was the largest of the three, since it measured in length and in width, as well as the tallest one, as can be seen by comparing the preserved columns of each of the temples. The present structure is due to the restoration commissioned by a certain Caecilia Metella in 90 BC.

The remains of the temple are the basement, which can be visited inside the church, and three columns incorporated into the facade, one of which has no capital; these columns were still visible in their original state before the facade was rebuilt. Other remains, such as some columns, are visible inside the church.

<text>The Green Standard Army (; Manchu: &quot;niowanggiyan turun i kūwaran&quot;) was the name of a category of military units under the control of Qing dynasty in China. It was made up mostly of ethnic Han soldiers and operated concurrently with the Manchu-Mongol-Han Eight Banner armies. In areas with a high concentration of Hui people, Muslims served as soldiers in the Green Standard Army. After the Qing consolidated control over China, the Green Standard Army was primarily used as a police force.

Despite its name, the Green Standard Army served as a gendarmerie rather than a military force. After the formation of &quot;brave battalions&quot; in response to the mid-19th century rebellions in China, who were mercenaries hired and financed by provincial governors, the Green Standard were relegated for local security only, while the braves became the Qing dynasty&#x27;s rapid response force. There was an effort starting in the 1860s to modernize Green Standard units to make them similar to the braves, and the Late Qing reforms in the early 1900s began the process of disbanding the worst Green Standard forces while integrating the rest into the New Army. This process was not completed before the 1911 Revolution against the Qing dynasty and the Green Standard were being used as reservists for the New Army.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The original Green Standard troops were the soldiers of the Ming commanders who surrendered to the Qing in 1644 and after. Their troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service; they usually came from the socially disadvantaged, and remained segregated from Chinese society, partly because of the latter&#x27;s deep anti-military bias during the late Ming period, and partly because they were paid too poorly and irregularly to marry and support a family.

The Qing relied on the Green Standard soldiers, comprising defected Han Ming military forces who joined the Qing, in order to help rule northern China. It was Green Standard Han troops who actively military governed China locally while Han Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, and Manchu Bannermen were only brought into emergency situations when there was sustained military resistance.

=== Koxinga and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories ===
The Manchus sent Han Chinese Bannermen to fight against Ming loyalists in Guangdong, Zhejiang and Fujian. The Qing carried out a massive depopulation policy and clearances, forcing people to evacuate the coast in order to deprive Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists of resources, leading to a myth that it was because Manchus were &quot;afraid of water&quot;. In parts of Southern Fujian, northern Han Bannermen fought for the Qing and, in so doing, disproved the claim that the earlier coastal evacuation, which especially affected the ethnic Tanka people, was ordered by the Manchus out of fear of the water.

At the outset of the Revolt of the Three Feudatories (1673–81), four hundred thousand Green Standard Army soldiers were deployed by the Manchus/Qing against the Three Feudatories, in addition to 200,000 Bannermen. However, during 1673 and 1674, the Qing forces were soundly defeated by the forces of the rebel Wu Sangui. The Qing had the support of the majority of Han Chinese soldiers and the Han elite against the Three Feudatories and they refused to join Wu Sangui in the revolt, but the Eight Banners and Manchu officers fared poorly against Wu&#x27;s forces, so the Qing responded with a massive army of more than 900,000 non-Banner Han Chinese, instead of the Eight Banners, to subdue the rebels. Wu Sangui&#x27;s forces were crushed by the Green Standard Army, which was made up of defected Ming soldiers.

During the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, which was noted by the Kangxi Emperor, leading him to task generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong with leading Green Standard Soldiers to put down the rebellion. The Qing considered the Han Chinese to be superior fighters, so used the Green Standard Army, rather than Bannermen, as the main force in defeating the rebels.

Against Wang Fuchen in north-western China, the Qing put Bannermen in the rear as reserves. They used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese generals, such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong, as the primary military forces, and they achieved victory over the rebels. Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were retaken in 1680 by the Han Chinese Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong, with Manchus only dealing with logistics and provisions. Four hundred thousand Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. Two hundred and thirteen Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing during the revolt.

=== Reform and decline===
Reform of the Qing military system by the Kangxi Emperor during the last years of the War of the Three Feudatories led to a fundamental division of military administration and function between two branches of the Qing Army. The Eight Banners of the old Banner system were retained as a guard force for the dynasty, but Chinese and Mongol troops were progressively transferred out during the 18th century, until most Banner troops were once again ethnic Manchus.

The Qing divided the command structure of the Green Standard Army in the provinces between the high-ranking officers and low-ranking officers. The best and strongest unit was under the control of the highest-ranking officers but, at the same time, those units were outnumbered by other units, which were divided between various lower-ranking officers, so that none of them could initiate a revolt on their own against the Qing because they did not control the entire armies.

From the 18th century onwards, the Green Standard Army served primarily as a gendarmerie or constabulary, employed to maintain local law and order and quell small-scale disturbances. It also contributed the bulk of forces dispatched in major campaigns. The Green Standard Army was extremely fragmented, with thousands of large and small outposts throughout the empire, many with as few as twelve men. It was divided into garrisons of battalion size, reporting through regional brigade generals to commanders-in-chief () in each province. Governors and governors-general each had a battalion of Green Standard troops under their personal command, but their primary duties lay in the judicial and revenue areas rather than coping with invasion or rebellion. During peacetime, it was rare for one officer to command more than 5,000 men.

Strictly speaking, the Green Standard Army was not a hereditary force, although the dynasty directed its recruiting efforts primarily at sons and other relatives of serving soldiers. Enlistment was considered a lifetime occupation, but it was generally very simple to obtain a discharge and be reclassified as a civilian.

A system of rotation was used for Green Standard troops in frontier areas. In Kashgaria, troops of the Green Standard from Shaanxi and Gansu had to serve for three-year tours of duty, later increased to five years, then returned home.

As early as the White Lotus Rebellion of 1794–1804, the Green Standard armies had begun to exhibit a decline in military effectiveness that rendered them utterly ineffective in combating rebels. At least eight factors contributed to this decline: (1) soldiers&#x27; pay did not rise with inflation, requiring most to seek outside employment to support their families; (2) wide dispersion of posts prevented centralized training while the armies&#x27; policing and civic responsibilities left little time for drilling; (3) wartime forces were created by taking small numbers of soldiers from numerous existing units rather than using existing units, breaking up unit cohesion and leading to &quot;divisive influence, poor coordination, and operative inefficiency&quot;; (4) vacancies in the armies&#x27; ranks were either left unfilled so officers could pocket the missing soldiers&#x27; allowances or fill positions with personal proteges; (5) rampant gambling and opium addictions; (6) the practice of allowing soldiers to hire substitutes, often beggars, to train and fight in their place; (7) infrequent drilling; (8) lax discipline due to a lack of respect for inept officers often appointed due to favoritism or nepotism.

Ma Zhan&#x27;ao, a former Muslim rebel, defected to the Qing side during the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) and his Muslim forces were then recruited into the Green Standard Army of the Qing military after the war ended.

The Qing dynasty tried to reform its armed forces into a modern, European-style national army after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Boxer Rebellion (1900). The Green Standard Army was completely restructured. In 1907, the Commission on Army Reorganization recommended that the worst of the Green Standard troops be discharged, with the rest reorganized into provincial &quot;Patrol and Defence Forces&quot;, to serve as a gendarmerie in peacetime and a reserve for the regular forces during war. About 20 to 30 per cent of the Green Standard units were slated to be dissolved. By the time of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the reform of those units was still in progress, but Patrol and Defence Forces had been established in almost every province.

<text>Redology () is the academic study of Cao Xueqin&#x27;s &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China. There are numerous researchers in this field; most can be divided into four general groups: the first group are the commentators, such as Zhou Chun, Xu Fengyi, Chen Yupi, and others; the second group is the index group, which includes Wang Mengruan and Cai Yuanpei; the third group are the textual critics, including Hu Shih and Yu Pingbo; the final group are the literary critics, including Zhou Ruchang and Li Xifan.

==History==
A 1976 essay by Joey Bonner split the Chinese critical reception of the novel into five phases:
*;Pre-1791: Commentators on the pre-publication manuscripts, such as Rouge Inkstone and Odd Tablet, who mainly provide literary analysis of the first 80 chapters.
*;1791–1900: Post-publication questions over authorship of the addendum, speculation upon esoteric aspects of the book. After 1875 using the term &quot;Redology&quot; for the studies.
*;1900–1922: Political interpretations.
*;1922–1953: &quot;New Redology&quot; led by Hu Shih, approach questions of textual authenticity, documentation, dating, and a strong autobiographical focus. The labelling of previous periods as &quot;Old Redology&quot;.
*;1954–current [1975]: Marxist literary criticism, the book seen as a criticism of society&#x27;s failures. Li Xifan&#x27;s criticism of both Old Redology and Neo-Redologists such as Hu Shih and Yu Pingbo.

== Academic research institutes ==
There are many Redology academic institutions, especially university affiliated ones: 
* The Society of the Dream of the Red Chamber (中国红楼梦学会) in Beijing
* The Cao Xueqin Society of Beijing (北京曹雪芹学会) in Beijing
* The Cao Xueqin Center for Aesthetics and Art (北京大学曹雪芹美学艺术研究中心) at Peking University, Beijing

<text>The Big Hit is a 1998 American action comedy film directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Che-Kirk Wong, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christina Applegate, Bokeem Woodbine, Antonio Sabàto Jr., China Chow, Avery Brooks, Lainie Kazan, Elliott Gould, Sab Shimono and Lela Rochon.

The film was shot in Hamilton and Pickering, Ontario, Canada.

==Plot==
Melvin Smiley has a good life thanks to his talents as a contract-killer, but has a very working class mentality going about his life, in combination with his constant struggles to maintain two romantic relationships. One is with the demanding and demeaning Chantel, who does not accept his work, and the other with Pam, who knows nothing of his job. Melvin is somewhat of a pushover, trying to appease all of Chantel&#x27;s demands, even her most expensive wishes, as well as rolling over whenever one of his co-workers takes credit for his achievements. Perhaps as a result of his helplessness in asserting himself, throughout the early scenes, Melvin is often seen drinking Maalox to relieve a developing stress-induced ulcer.

Feeling underpaid for their work for mob boss Paris, the assassin team of Smiley, Cisco, Crunch, Vince and Gump take an independent job, kidnapping Keiko Nishi, the teenage daughter of local electronics magnate Jiro Nishi, for a hefty ransom. Unfortunately, the team does not realize that Nishi has recently gone bankrupt over his failed foray into films and furthermore, their boss Paris is the girl&#x27;s godfather. Enlisted by the group to hold Keiko, Melvin has to hide the bound and gagged schoolgirl on his property, attempting to keep her presence hidden from Pam and her parents, who are coming for dinner.

Melvin feels sorry for Keiko and relieves her from her bondage. In the ensuing hours they build up a rapport preparing dinner together, an act which leads into a love scene reminiscent of the pottery scene from &quot;Ghost&quot;, but which is cut short when Keiko attempts to escape. Ordered by Paris to discover the kidnappers of his goddaughter, a panicked Cisco kills Gump, but not before coaxing him into also implicating Melvin for the kidnapping.

A team of assassins crash Melvin&#x27;s dinner with Pam&#x27;s family, leading to a shootout during which Melvin realizes Pam was going to break up with him over pressure from her mother, a hardcore Jew who is severely against her being with Melvin, a Gentile. Melvin and Keiko&#x27;s growing feelings for each other lead them to forming an awkward romance, and she and Melvin attempt to escape from the fiasco, pursued by Cisco. In the chaos, Melvin happens to run into Chantel and finally takes the opportunity to stand up to her and end their relationship.

A fight ensues between Cisco and Melvin, culminating at a video store where the ever-honest Melvin stops to return an overdue tape of &quot;King Kong Lives&quot;. Melvin kills Cisco by stabbing him in the chest, but not before Cisco arms an explosive device. Melvin leaves the building and is confronted by Keiko, her father and Paris. He re-enters the building, which explodes.

Paris and Nishi, believing Melvin to be dead, call off the manhunt. Soon Melvin is revealed to have survived, sheltered from the blast by an enormous solid gold film stand-up made for the flop that destroyed Nishi&#x27;s career. Melvin and Keiko are reunited and ride off together, while Nishi recoups his losses by making a film out of the story of his daughter&#x27;s kidnapping.

==Production==
&quot;The Big Hit&quot; was shot for the relatively low budget of $13 million and was produced by film partners John Woo, Terence Chang, and Wesley Snipes.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted at #1 at the box office. It went on to gross $27.0 million domestically.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Big Hit&quot; had a mixed reception from critics.

Jack Matthews commented in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;&quot;The Big Hit&quot;, which was brought to Wesley Snipes&#x27; production company by Hong Kong legend John Woo, attempts to take the East-West merger even further, and the result is an only fitfully funny comic mongrel.&quot;

Remarked Roger Ebert, &quot;I guess you could laugh at this. You would have to be seriously alienated from normal human values and be nursing a deep-seated anger against movies that make you think even a little, but you could laugh.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Lawrence Van Gelder was equally scathing: &quot;If &quot;The Big Hit&quot; had any valid claim to excellence, rest assured that its release would have been delayed till summer. That, experience shows, is the proper season for movies built on a foundation of lavish crime, carnage, comedy, chases, crashes and chicks. &quot;The Big Hit&quot; has all these elements, and none are top-of-the-line. The name of John Woo, the talented Hong Kong-school director of the hit &quot;Face/Off&quot;, is plastered around &quot;The Big Hit&quot;. But this bait should not deter the eye from the switch: Woo is an executive producer. The director of &quot;The Big Hit&quot; is Che-Kirk Wong, another Hong Kong veteran, making his North American debut. Insatiable moviegoers are advised to wait till this action-comedy, written by Ben Ramsey, thuds into video stores; tasteful moviegoers will avoid it altogether.&quot;

And finally, Jeff Vice of the LDS Church-owned &quot;Deseret News&quot; remarked: &quot;Every bit as as it is entertaining, this black comedy/thriller takes its plotting and dialogue cues from Tarantino (meaning there is rampant use of profanity) and its startling visual style from Woo, who served as the film&#x27;s executive producer. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a very uneasy blending of the two styles, and as a result there as many awful moments as good ones—at least until the extremely unsatisfying and drawn-out conclusion, which blows things completely.&quot;

In a retrospective review published in 2010, critic Leonard Maltin praised the film as a guilty pleasure, and said that &quot;most critics despised &quot;The Big Hit&quot;, and audiences didn&#x27;t flock to see it, perhaps confused as to whether it was a comedy or an action movie ... and never dreaming it was a hybrid of the two.&quot; He also states, &quot;it expands its ideas to such a ludicrous extreme that you can&#x27;t take it seriously, and that&#x27;s just what I like about it.&quot;

It currently holds a 41% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews, with an average score of 5.1/10. The site consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Big Hit&quot; seeks to blend the best of Hong Kong and American action cinema, but ends up offering a muddled mush that mostly misses&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>A numeric character reference (NCR) is a common markup construct used in SGML and SGML-derived markup languages such as HTML and XML. It consists of a short sequence of characters that, in turn, represents a single character. Since WebSgml, XML and HTML 4, the code points of the Universal Character Set (UCS) of Unicode are used. NCRs are typically used in order to represent characters that are not directly encodable in a particular document (for example, because they are international characters that do not fit in the 8-bit character set being used, or because they have special syntactic meaning in the language). When the document is interpreted by a markup-aware reader, each NCR is treated as if it were the character it represents.

==Examples==
In SGML, HTML, and XML, the following are all valid numeric character references for the Greek capital letter Sigma
In SGML, HTML, and XML, the following are all valid numeric character references for the Latin capital letter AE
In SGML, HTML, and XML, the following are all valid numeric character references for the Latin small letter sharp s ß

==Discussion==
Markup languages are typically defined in terms of UCS or Unicode characters. That is, a document consists, at its most fundamental level of abstraction, of a sequence of characters, which are abstract units that exist independently of any encoding.

Ideally, when the characters of a document utilizing a markup language are encoded for storage or transmission over a network as a sequence of bits, the encoding that is used will be one that supports representing each and every character in the document, if not in the whole of Unicode, directly as a particular bit sequence.

Sometimes, though, for reasons of convenience or due to technical limitations, documents are encoded with an encoding that cannot represent some characters directly. For example, the widely used encodings based on ISO 8859 can only represent, at most, 256 unique characters as one 8-bit byte each.

Documents are rarely, in practice, ever allowed to use more than one encoding internally, so the onus is usually on the markup language to provide a means for document authors to express unencodable characters in terms of encodable ones. This is generally done through some kind of &quot;escaping&quot; mechanism.

The SGML-based markup languages allow document authors to use special sequences of characters from the ASCII range (the first 128 code points of Unicode) to represent, or &quot;reference&quot;, any Unicode character, regardless of whether the character being represented is directly available in the document&#x27;s encoding. These special sequences are &quot;character references&quot;.

Character references that are based on the referenced character&#x27;s UCS or Unicode code point are called &quot;numeric&quot; character references. In HTML 4 and in all versions of XHTML and XML, the code point can be expressed either as a decimal (base 10) number or as a hexadecimal (base 16) number. The syntax is as follows:

Character U+0026 (ampersand), followed by character U+0023 (number sign), followed by one of the following choices:

* one or more decimal digits zero (U+0030) through nine (U+0039); or
* character U+0078 (&quot;x&quot;) followed by one or more hexadecimal digits, which are zero (U+0030) through nine (U+0039), Latin capital letter A (U+0041) through F (U+0046), and Latin small letter a (U+0061) through f (U+0066);

all followed by character U+003B (semicolon). Older versions of HTML disallowed the hexadecimal syntax.

The characters that comprise a numeric character reference can be represented in every character encoding used in computing and telecommunications today, so there is no risk of the reference itself being unencodable.

There is another kind of character reference called a &quot;character entity reference&quot;, which allows a character to be referred to by a name instead of a number. (Naming a character creates a &quot;character entity&quot;.) HTML defines some character entities, but not many; all other characters can only be included by direct encoding or using NCRs.

==Restrictions==
The Universal Character Set defined by ISO 10646 is the &quot;document character set&quot; of SGML, HTML 4, so by default, any character in such a document, and any character &quot;referenced&quot; in such a document, must be in the UCS.

While the syntax of SGML does not prohibit references to invalid or unassigned code points, such as codice_1, SGML-derived markup languages such as HTML and XML can, and often do, restrict numeric character references to only those code points that are assigned to characters.

Restrictions may also apply for other reasons. For example, in HTML 4, codice_2, which is a reference to a non-printing &quot;form feed&quot; control character, is allowed because a form feed character is allowed. But in XML, the form feed character cannot be used, not even by reference. As another example, codice_3, which is a reference to another control character, is not allowed to be used or referenced in either HTML or XML, but when used in HTML, it is usually not flagged as an error by web browsers – some of which interpret it as a reference to the character represented by code value 128 in the Windows-1252 encoding for compatibility reasons. This character, &quot;€&quot;, has to be represented as codice_4 in a standard-compliant HTML code. As a further example, prior to the publication of XML 1.0 Second Edition on October 6, 2000, XML 1.0 was based on an older version of ISO 10646 and prohibited using characters above U+FFFD, except in character data, thus making a reference like codice_5 (U+10000) illegal. In XML 1.1 and newer editions of XML 1.0, such a reference is allowed, because the available character repertoire was explicitly extended.

Markup languages also place restrictions on where character references can occur.

==Compatibility issues==

In the initial versions of SGML and HTML, numeric character references were interpreted in relationship to the document character encoding, rather than Unicode. For Latin-script documents, numeric character references to characters between x80 and x9F in those documents will not be correct against Unicode, and must be recoded. HTML standards prior to HTML 4 supported only Western Latin script documents: the treatment of character references above #7F may vary between applications and national conventions.

For example, as mentioned above, the correct numeric character reference for the Euro sign &quot;€&quot; codice_6 when using Unicode is decimal codice_4 and hexadecimal codice_8. However, if using tools supporting obsolete implementations of HTML, the reference codice_3 (Euro sign in the CP-1252 code page) or codice_10 (Euro sign in ISO/IEC 8859-15) may work.

As another example, if some text was created originally using the MacRoman character set, the left double quotation mark will be represented with code point xD2. This will not display properly in a system expecting a document encoded as UTF-8, ISO 8859-1, or CP-1252, where this code point is occupied by the letter Ò. The correct numeric character reference for in HTML 4 and newer is codice_11, because U+201C is its UCS code. In some systems, the named character reference codice_12 may also be available.

<text>A radiometer or roentgenometer is a device for measuring the radiant flux (power) of electromagnetic radiation. Generally, a radiometer is an infrared radiation detector or an ultraviolet detector. Microwave radiometers operate in the microwave wavelengths.

While the term &quot;radiometer&quot; can refer to any device that measures electromagnetic radiation (e.g. light), the term is often used to refer specifically to a Crookes radiometer (&quot;light-mill&quot;), a device invented in 1873 in which a rotor (having vanes which are dark on one side, and light on the other) in a partial vacuum spins when exposed to light. 
A common misbelief (one originally held even by Crookes) is that the momentum of the absorbed light on the black faces makes the radiometer operate. 
If this were true, however, the radiometer would spin away from the non-black faces, since the photons bouncing off those faces impart more momentum than the photons absorbed on the black faces. 
Photons do exert radiation pressure on the faces, but those forces are dwarfed by other effects.
The currently accepted explanation depends on having just the right degree of vacuum, and relates to the transfer of heat rather than the direct effect of photons.

A Nichols radiometer demonstrates photon pressure. It is much more sensitive than the Crookes radiometer and it operates in a complete vacuum, whereas operation of the Crookes radiometer requires an imperfect vacuum.

The MEMS radiometer can operate on the principles of Nichols or Crookes and can operate over a wide spectrum of wavelength and particle energy levels.

<text>The are terracotta clay figures that were made for ritual use and buried with the dead as funerary objects during the Kofun period (3rd to 6th centuries AD) of the history of Japan. &quot;Haniwa&quot; were created according to the &quot;wazumi&quot; technique, in which mounds of coiled clay were built up to shape the figure, layer by layer. &quot;Haniwa&quot; can also refer to offering cylinders, not the clay sculptures on top of them as well as the &quot;wooden haniwa&quot; found in Kofun tumuli.

Terracotta &quot;Haniwa&quot; were made with water-based clay and dried into a coarse and absorbent material that stood the test of time. Their name means &quot;circle of clay&quot;, referring to how they were arranged in a circle above the tomb. The protruding parts of the figures were made separately and then attached, while a few things were carved into them. They were smoothed out by a wooden paddle. Terraces were arranged to place them with a cylindrical base into the ground, where the earth would hold them in place.

During the Kofun period, a highly aristocratic society with militaristic rulers developed. The cavalry wore iron armor, carried swords and other weapons, and used advanced military methods like those of northeast Asia. Many of them are represented in &quot;haniwa&quot; figurines for funerary purposes.

The most important of the &quot;haniwa&quot; were found in southern Honshū—especially the Kinai region around Nara—and northern Kyūshū. &quot;Haniwa&quot; grave offerings were made in many forms, such as horses, chickens, birds, fans, fish, houses, weapons, shields, sunshades, pillows, and humans. Besides decorative and spiritual reasons of protecting the deceased in the afterlife, these figures served as a sort of retaining wall for the burial mound.

Because these &quot;haniwa&quot; display the contemporary clothing, hairstyle, farming tools, and architecture, these sculptures are important as a historical archive of the Kofun Period.

Everyday pottery items from that period are called Haji pottery.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Earlier, clay figurines, called &quot;dogū&quot;, appeared during the Jōmon period.

Hiroaki Sato cites a passage from the Nihon Shoki, in which Emperor Suinin issued an imperial edict concerning funerals: &quot;From now on make it a rule to erect clay figures and not to hurt people.&quot; It was therefore thought that these clay figures may have replaced live human sacrifices. However, &quot;haniwa&quot; figures were not made until long after Suinin&#x27;s rule had ended. 

The origin of &quot;haniwa&quot; started during the latter part of the Yayoi period around the Kingdom of Kibi. During this time special earthenware figurines and bowls started to appear on top of the tombs of leaders. The early sculptures exceeded 1 m (3.3 ft) in length. They consisted of a cylindrical portion, which represented the torso, and a skirt-shaped portion at the base, which represented the legs. Many times a special insignia or pattern would be displayed on the torso. Sometimes an obi would be placed around the torso. These sculptures are thought to have been used as part of a funeral ritual. Other than the Kibi area, the only other place these sculptures were found was in the Izumo province.

During the latter part of the third century, these sculptures started to appear on top of the imperial grave mounds in the Kinai region. During this time more elaborate &quot;haniwa&quot; appeared with earthenware bowls. It is believed that the movement of these sculptures and &quot;haniwa&quot; from the Kibi region to the Kinai region is indicative of an increase in their importance.

===Later developments===
During the earlier part of the Kofun period (later 3rd century CE) the only earthenware &quot;haniwa&quot; were cylindrical, like barrels. These haniwa barrels were used to form the kofun mound. They were arranged in the shape of the mound (square, circle, or keyhole) and soil was brought in to fill the interior, and then a new row of haniwa barrels was arranged to make the next level and the process was repeated until the mound was the desired height. Additional soil was added to the exterior to form sloping sides.

Toward the early 4th century CE, &quot;haniwa&quot; sculptures in the shape of shields and other tools started to appear. By the middle Kofun period (mid-5th century AD), there were &quot;haniwa&quot; statues in the shape of shrine maidens, horses, dogs, and other animals. As the practice of ceremonial burial mounds declined in the mid-6th century CE, &quot;haniwa&quot; became rarer in the Kinai region; however, &quot;haniwa&quot; were made in abundance in the Kantō region.

It is not uncommon for some haniwa to be painted with red dye or other colors. Besides the cylindrical haniwa (enkei-haniwa), another common type was the house-shaped haniwa (keisho-haniwa). Other things that fell into the category of keisho-haniwa were those shaped like humans, animals, and swords. The details on the haniwa give information about the elite buried in the tomb, and represent some of the tools or other objects people of that time used. The military haniwa inform archeologists of the armour and weapons, as well as the status symbols of the military class.
==Significance ==
Originally, the cylindrical type &quot;haniwa&quot; were set on top of the funeral mounds, so it is believed that they had a purpose in funeral rituals; however, as the &quot;haniwa&quot; became more developed, they were set toward the outside of the grave area. It is thought that they were used as boundary markers for the borders of the gravesite.

There is a theory that the soul of the deceased would reside in the &quot;haniwa&quot;, as the earlier &quot;haniwa&quot; were placed on top of the funeral mounds. There are &quot;haniwa&quot; that are equipped with weapons and armor. These are thought to be containers for souls. The armor and weapons would drive away evil spirits and protect the buried ruler from calamity. Because the horse- and animal-shaped &quot;haniwa&quot; were normally neatly arranged into a line, it is believed that they were part of a sending-off ceremony.

==In modern society==

Although the religious implications of the &quot;haniwa&quot; have largely declined in modern society, the sculptures are prized by many for their aesthetic and historical significance. The works of Isamu Noguchi, for example, were heavily influenced by the &quot;haniwa&quot;. They have been accepted as &quot;Pure Art&quot;, according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Beyond simple appreciation as artistic sculptures, modern popular culture has, in some cases, portrayed the &quot;haniwa&quot; as containing a sentient entity and not just as a simple empty sculpture.

The portrayal of living &quot;haniwa&quot; has—since the late 1990s—become widespread, being featured in entertainment mediums, including but not limited to: video games, trading cards, movies, and television. In some of the depictions, the &quot;haniwa&quot; is primarily presented as a ghostlike, malevolent creature with no emotional remorse to complete its task. The most common portrayal depicts the &quot;haniwa&quot; with a rounded, pot-like shape, bearing two deep eyes, a wide mouth, and two featureless &quot;arms&quot; on opposite sides of the &quot;pot&quot;. Gyroids in the Animal Crossing video game series are based on Haniwa.

<doc id="839722" wikidata="Q250747" url="?curid=839722" title="Race to the Sea">
<text>The Race to the Sea (; , ) took place from about 1914 during the First World War, after the Battle of the Frontiers () and the German advance into France. The invasion had been stopped at the First Battle of the Marne and was followed by the First Battle of the Aisne a Franco-British counter-offensive. The term describes reciprocal attempts by the Franco-British and German armies to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army through the provinces of Picardy, Artois and Flanders, rather than an attempt to advance northwards to the sea. The &quot;race&quot; ended on the North Sea coast of Belgium around 19 October, when the last open area from Diksmuide to the North Sea was occupied by Belgian troops who had retreated after the Siege of Antwerp (28 September – 10 October). The outflanking attempts had resulted in a number of encounter battles but neither side was able to gain a decisive victory.

After the opposing forces had reached the North Sea, both tried to conduct offensives leading to the mutually costly and indecisive Battle of the Yser from 16 October to 2 November and the First Battle of Ypres from 19 October to 22 November. After mid-November, local operations were carried out by both sides and preparations were made to take the offensive in the spring of 1915. Erich von Falkenhayn, Chief of the German General Staff ( OHL) since 14 September, concluded that a decisive victory could not be achieved on the Western Front and that it was equally unlikely in the east. Falkenhayn abandoned (strategy of annihilation) and attempted to create the conditions for peace with one of Germany&#x27;s enemies, by (strategy of exhaustion), to enable Germany to concentrate its resources decisively to defeat the remaining opponents.

Over the winter lull, the French army established the theoretical basis of offensive trench warfare, originating many of the methods which became standard for the rest of the war. Infiltration tactics, in which dispersed formations of infantry were followed by (trench cleaners), to capture by-passed strong points were promulgated. Artillery observation from aircraft and creeping barrages, were first used systematically in the Second Battle of Artois from 9 May to 18 June 1915. Falkenhayn issued memoranda on 1915, to govern defensive battle on the Western Front, in which the existing front line was to be fortified and to be held indefinitely with small numbers of troops, to enable more divisions to be sent to the Eastern Front. New defences were to be built behind the front line to contain a breakthrough until the position was restored by counter-attacks. The began the huge task of building field fortifications, which were not complete until the autumn of 1915.
==Background==
===Strategic developments===

====Plan XVII====
Under Plan XVII the French peacetime army was to form five field armies, with groups of Reserve divisions attached and a group of reserve divisions was to assemble on each flank, The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around Épinal, Nancy and Verdun–Charleville-Mezières, with an army in reserve around Sainte-Menehould and Commercy. Since 1871 railway building had given the French General Staff sixteen lines to the German frontier against thirteen available to the German army and the French could wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in Lorraine or through Belgium. It was anticipated that the Germans would use reserve troops but also expected that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium south of the Meuse and the Sambre rivers. French intelligence had obtained a map exercise of the German general staff of 1905, in which German troops had gone no further north than Namur and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army.

A German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards Mézières and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and St. Dié was anticipated; the plan was an evolution from Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive through Belgium. The First, Second and Third Armies were to concentrate between Épinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from Montmédy to Sedan and Mézières and the Fourth Army was to be held back west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or southwards against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but joint arrangements had been made and in 1911 during the Second Moroccan Crisis the French had been told that six divisions could be expected to operate around Maubeuge.

====Schlieffen–Moltke Plan====
German strategy had given priority to offensive operations against France and a defensive posture against Russia since 1891. German planning was determined by numerical inferiority, the speed of mobilisation and concentration and the effect of the vast increase of the power of modern weapons. Frontal attacks were expected to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised their fortifications on the frontiers with Germany. Alfred von Schlieffen, Chief of the Imperial German General Staff, (OHL) from devised plans to evade the French frontier fortifications with an offensive on the flank, which would have a local numerical superiority and obtain rapidly a decisive victory. By 1906, such a manoeuvre was intended to pass through neutral Belgium and threaten Paris from the north. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan, to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants to the plan, by adding divisions to the left flank opposite the French frontier, from the expected to be mobilised in the (western army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium and attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on the left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine, unable to withdraw into central France. Either the French would be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine on the common border.

====Battle of the Frontiers, 7 August – 13 September====


The Battle of the Frontiers is a general name for all of the operations of the French armies until the Battle of the Marne. A series of encounter battles began between the German, French and Belgian armies, on the German-French frontier and in southern Belgium on 4 August 1914. The Battle of Mulhouse (Battle of Alsace ) was the first French offensive against Germany. The French captured Mulhouse until forced out by a German counter-attack on 11 August and fell back toward Belfort. The main French offensive, the Battle of Lorraine , began with the Battles of Morhange and Sarrebourg () advances by the First Army on Sarrebourg and the Second Army towards Morhange. Château-Salins near Morhange was captured on 17 August and Sarrebourg the next day. The German 6th Army and 7th Army counter-attacked on 20 August and the Second Army was forced back from Morhange and the First Army was repulsed at Sarrebourg. The German armies crossed the border and advanced on Nancy but were stopped to the east of the city.

To the south the French retook Mulhouse on 19 August and then withdrew. On 24 August, at the Battle of the Mortagne a limited German offensive in the Vosges, the Germans managed a small advance, before a French counter-attack retook the ground. By 20 August, a German counter-offensive in Lorraine had begun and the German 4th Army and 5th Army advanced through the Ardennes on 19 August towards Neufchâteau. An offensive by French Third and Fourth Armies through the Ardennes began on 20 August, in support of the French invasion of Lorraine. The opposing armies met in thick fog and the French mistook the German troops for screening forces. On 22 August, the Battle of the Ardennes began with French attacks, which were costly to both sides and forced the French into a disorderly retreat late on 23 August. The Third Army recoiled towards Verdun, pursued by the 5th Army and the Fourth Army retreated to Sedan and Stenay. Mulhouse was recaptured again by German forces and the Battle of the Meuse caused a temporary halt of the German advance.
Liège was occupied by the Germans on 7 August, the first units of the BEF landed in France and French troops crossed the German frontier. On 12 August, the Battle of Haelen was fought by German and Belgian cavalry and infantry and was a Belgian defensive success. The BEF completed its move of four divisions and a cavalry division to France on 16 August, as the last Belgian fort of the Fortified Position of Liège surrendered. The Belgian government withdrew from Brussels on 18 August and the German army attacked the Belgian field army at the Battle of the Gete. Next day the Belgian army began to retire towards Antwerp, which left the route to Namur open; Longwy and Namur were besieged on 20 August. Further west the Fifth Army had concentrated on the Sambre by 20 August, facing north either side of Charleroi and east towards the Belgian Fortified Position of Namur. On the left, the Cavalry Corps (General André Sordet) linked with the BEF at Mons.

The Fifth Army was confronted by the German 3rd Army and 2nd Army from the east and the north. Before the Fifth Army could attack over the Sambre the 2nd Army attacked at the Battle of Charleroi and at Namur on 21 August. The 3rd Army crossed the Meuse and attacked the French right flank and on 23 August, the Fifth Army began a retirement southwards to avoid encirclement. After the Battle of St. Quentin, the French withdrawal continued. On 22 August, the BEF advanced and on 23 August fought the Battle of Mons, a delaying action against the German 1st Army, to protect the left flank of the French Fifth Army. The BEF was forced to retreat when the 1st Army began to overrun the British defences on the right flank and the Fifth Army retired from the area south of the Sambre, exposing the British right flank to envelopment. Namur capitulated on 25 August and a Belgian sortie from Antwerp led to the Battle of Malines 

After the French defeat during the Battle of Lorraine, the French Second Army retreated to the Grand Couronné heights near Nancy and dug in, on an arc from Pont-à-Mousson to Champenoux, Lunéville and Dombasle-sur-Meurthe by 3 September. The Battle of Grand Couronné (4–13 September) began next day, when the German 7th and 6th Armies attacked simultaneously at St. Dié and Nancy, as the Second Army sent reinforcements to the Third Army. Costly fighting continued until 12 September but the French were able to withdraw more than four corps to reinforce the armies on the left flank. On 13 September, Pont-à-Mousson and Lunéville were recaptured by the French and the advance continued close to the Seille river, where the front stabilised. The battles kept a large number of German troops in Lorraine, as the Great Retreat further west culminated on the Marne.

====The Great Retreat, 24 August – 5 September====

The French Fifth Army fell back about from the Sambre during the Battle of Charleroi (22 August) and began a greater withdrawal from the area south of the Sambre on 23 August. The BEF fought the Battle of Mons on 24 August, by when the French First and Second armies had been pushed back by attacks of the German 7th and 6th armies between St. Dié and Nancy, the Third Army held positions east of Verdun against attacks by the 5th Army, the Fourth Army held positions from the junction with the Third Army south of Montmédy, westwards to Sedan, Mezières and Fumay, facing the 4th Army and the Fifth Army was between Fumay and Maubeuge, with the 3rd Army advancing up the Meuse valley from Dinant and Givet into a gap between the Fourth and Fifth Armies and the 2nd Army pressed forward into the angle between the Meuse and Sambre directly against the Fifth Army. On the far west flank of the French, the BEF prolonged the line from Maubeuge to Valenciennes against the 1st Army and Army Detachment von Beseler masked the Belgian Army at Antwerp.

On 26 August, German forces captured Valenciennes and conducted the Siege of Maubeuge Leuven (Louvain) was sacked by German troops and the Battle of Le Cateau was fought by the BEF and the 1st Army. Longwy was surrendered by its garrison and next day, British Royal Marines and a party of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) landed at Ostend; Lille and Mezières were occupied by German troops. Arras was occupied on 27 August and a French counter-offensive began at the Battle of St. Quentin (also known as the Battle of Guise On 29 August the Fifth Army counter-attacked the 2nd Army south of the Oise, from Vervins to Mont Dorigny and west of the river from Mont Dorigny to Moy towards St. Quentin on the Somme, while the British held the line of the Oise west of La Fère. Laon, La Fère and Roye were captured by German troops on 30 August and Amiens the next day. On 1 September, Craonne and Soissons were captured and on 5 September the BEF ended its retreat from Mons, German troops reached Claye, from Paris, Reims was captured, German forces withdrew from Lille and the First Battle of the Marne (Battle of the Ourcq) began, marking the end of the Great Retreat of the western flank of the Franco-British armies.

By 4 September, the First and Second Armies had slowed the advance of the 7th and 6th armies west of St. Dié and east of Nancy, from where the Second Army had withdrawn its left flank, to face north between Nancy and Toul. A gap between the left of the Second Army and the right of the Third Army at Verdun, which faced north-west, on a line towards Revigny against the 5th Army advance, west of the Meuse between Varennes and St. Ménéhould. The Fourth Army had withdrawn to Sermaize, west to the Marne at Vitry-le-François and then across the river to Sompons, against the 4th Army, which had advanced from Rethel, to Suippes and the west of Châlons. The new Ninth Army held a line from Mailly against the 3rd Army, which had advanced from Mézières, over the Vesle and the Marne west of Châlons. The 2nd Army had advanced from Marle on the Serre, across the Aisne and the Vesle, between Reims and Fismes to Montmort, north of the junction of the Ninth and Fifth Armies at Sézanne. The Fifth Army and the BEF had withdrawn south of the Oise, Serre, Aisne and Ourq, pursued by the 2nd Army on a line from Guise to Laon, Vailly and Dormans and by the 1st Army from Montdidier, towards Compiègne and then south-east towards Montmirail. The new French Sixth Army, linked with the left of the BEF, west of the Marne at Meaux, to Pontoise north of Paris. French garrisons were besieged at Strasbourg, Metz, Thionville, Longwy, Montmédy and Maubeuge. The Belgian army was invested at Antwerp in the National Redoubt and at Liège, fortress troops continued the defence of the forts.

====Eastern Front====

Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia on 28 July and on 1 August, military operations began on the Polish border. Libau was bombarded by a German cruiser on 2 August and on 5 August Montenegro declared war on Austria-Hungary. On 6 August, Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia and Serbia declared war on Germany; war began between Montenegro and Germany on 8 August. The Battle of Stallupönen (17 August) caused a minor check to the Russian invasion of East Prussia and on 12 August, Britain and France declared war on Austria-Hungary, as Austrian forces crossed the Save and seized Shabatz. Next day, Austrian forces crossed the Drina and began the first invasion of Serbia. The Battle of Cer (Battle of the Jadar, began and the Battle of Gumbinnen in East Prussia took place from 

On 21 August, Austro-Hungarian forces withdrew from Serbia. The Battle of Tannenberg began in East Prussia and in the Battle of Galicia the First Battle of Kraśnik was fought in Poland from Shabatz was retaken by Serbian forces and the last Austrian troops retired across the Drina, ending the First Austrian Invasion of Serbia. The First Battle of Lemberg began in Galicia and the Battle of Komarów and the Battle of Gnila Lipa began in Poland. A naval action took place off Åland and a German cruiser ran aground and was intercepted by a Russian squadron.
On 3 September, Lemberg was captured by the Russian army and the Battle of Rawa (Battle of Tarnavka began in Galicia. The First Battle of the Masurian Lakes began and on 8 September, the Austro-Hungarian army commenced the Second Invasion of Serbia, leading to the Battle of Drina The Second Battle of Lemberg began and on 11 September, Austrian forces in Galicia retreated. The Battle of the Masurian Lakes ended on 15 September and Czernowitz in Bukovina was taken by the Russian army. On 17 September, Serbian forces in Syrmia were withdrawn and Semlin evacuated, as the Battle of the Drina ended. Next day General Paul von Hindenburg was appointed (, Commander-in-Chief of German Armies in the Eastern Theatre).

On 21 September, Jaroslaw in Galicia was taken by the Russian army. On 24 September, Przemyśl was isolated by Russian forces, beginning the First Siege as Russian forces conducted the First Invasion of North Hungary Military operations began on the Niemen but German attacks were suspended on 29 September. The retreat of Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia ended and Maramaros-Sziget was captured by the Russian army; an Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive began on 4 October and Maramaros-Sziget was retaken. On 9 October, the First German Offensive against Warsaw began with the battles of Warsaw and Ivangorod As the situation on the eastern front deteriorated in September, the new German high command under General Falkenhayn attempted to retrieve the situation in France and inflict a decisive defeat.

On 2 August 1914, the Belgian government refused the passage of German troops through Belgium to France and on the night of the Belgian General Staff ordered the Third Division to Liège to obstruct a German advance. Covered by the Third Division, the Liège fortress garrison, a screen of the Cavalry Division and detachments from Liège and Namur, the rest of the Belgian field army closed up to the river Gete by 4 August, covering central and western Belgium and the communications towards Antwerp. The German invasion began on 4 August, when an advanced force of six German brigades from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Armies, crossed the German-Belgian border. Belgian resistance and German fear of , led the Germans to implement a policy of (frightfulness) against Belgian civilians soon after the invasion, in which massacres, executions, hostage taking and the burning of towns and villages took place and became known as the Rape of Belgium.

On 5 August, the advanced German forces tried to capture Liège and the forts of the Fortified Position of Liège by . The city fell on 6 August but the forts were not captured and on 12 August, five German super-heavy howitzers and four batteries of Austrian howitzers, began systematically to bombard the Belgian defences, until the last fort fell on 16 August. On 18 August, the Germans began to advance along the Meuse River towards Namur and the Belgian field army began a withdrawal from its positions along the Gete, to the National Redoubt at Antwerp. On 20 August, the German 1st Army took Brussels unopposed and the Belgian field army reached Antwerp, with little interference from German advanced parties, except for an engagement between the 1st Division and the German IX Corps near Tienen, in which the Belgians had 

While the BEF and the French armies conducted the Great Retreat into France small detachments of the Belgian, French and British armies conducted operations in Belgium against German cavalry and . On 27 August, a squadron of the RNAS had flown to Ostend, for air reconnaissance sorties between Bruges, Ghent and Ypres. British marines landed at Dunkirk on the night of and on 28 September occupied Lille. The rest of the brigade occupied Cassel on 30 September and scouted the country in motor cars. An RNAS Armoured Car Section was created, by fitting vehicles with bullet-proof steel. On 2 October, the Marine Brigade was moved to Antwerp, followed by the rest of the Naval Division on 6 October, having landed at Dunkirk on the night of From the 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division landed at Zeebrugge. Naval forces collected at Dover were formed into a separate unit, which became the Dover Patrol, to operate in the Channel and off the French-Belgian coast.
Antwerp was invested to the south and east by German forces after 20 August, while the main German armies chased the French and British over the border southwards to the Marne. Belgian forces in Antwerp tried to assist the French and British with sorties on and On 28 September, German heavy and super-heavy artillery began to bombard Belgian fortifications around Antwerp. On 1 October, the Germans attacked forts Sint-Katelijne-Waver and Walem and the Bosbeek and Dorpveld redoubts, held by the 5th Reserve and Marine divisions. By Fort Walem was severely damaged and Fort Lier was hit by shells but Fort Koningshooikt, the Tallabert and Bosbeek redoubts were mostly intact; the intervening ground between Fort Sint-Katelijne-Waver and Dorpveld redoubt had been captured. Despite reinforcement by the Royal Naval Division from 2 October, the Germans penetrated the outer ring of forts. When the German advance began to compress a corridor from the west of the city along the Dutch border to the coast, the Belgian field army withdrew from Antwerp westwards towards the coast. On 9 October, the remaining garrison surrendered and the Germans occupied the city. Some British and Belgian troops escaped to the Netherlands, where they were interned for the duration of the war. The Belgian withdrawal was protected by a French Marine brigade, Belgian cavalry and the British 7th Division around Ghent. On 15 October, the Belgian army occupied a defensive line along the Yser river in west Flanders, from Diksmuide to the coast.

====First Battle of the Marne, 5–12 September====

Joffre used the railways which had transported French troops to the German frontier to move troops back from Lorraine and Alsace to form a new Sixth Army under General Michel-Joseph Maunoury with nine divisions and two cavalry divisions. By 10 September, twenty divisions and three cavalry divisions had been moved west from the German border to the French centre and left and the balance of force between the German and the Third, Fourth, Ninth, Fifth armies, the BEF and Sixth Army had changed to Late on 4 September, Joffre ordered the Sixth Army to attack eastwards over the Ourcq towards Château Thierry as the BEF advanced towards Montmirail and the Fifth Army attacked northwards, with its right flank protected by the Ninth Army along the St. Gond marshes. The French First, Second, Third and Fourth armies to the east, were to resist the attacks of the German between Verdun and Toul and repulse an enveloping attack on the defences south of Nancy from the north. The 6th and 7th armies were reinforced by heavy artillery from Metz and attacked again on 4 September along the Moselle.

On 5 September, the Sixth Army advanced eastwards from Paris and met the German IV Reserve Corps, which had moved into the area that morning and stopped the French advance short of high ground north of Meaux. Overnight, the IV Reserve Corps withdrew to a better position east and French air reconnaissance observed German forces moving north to face the Sixth Army. General Alexander von Kluck the 1st Army commander, ordered the II Corps to move back to the north bank of the Marne, which began a redeployment of all four 1st Army corps to the north bank by 8 September. The swift move to the north bank prevented the Sixth Army from crossing the Ourcq but created a gap between the 1st and 2nd armies. The BEF advanced from crossed the Petit Morin, captured bridges over the Marne and established a bridgehead deep. The Fifth Army also advanced into the gap and by 8 September, had crossed the Petit Morin, which forced Bülow to withdraw the right flank of the 2nd Army. Next day the Fifth Army re-crossed the Marne and the German 1st and 2nd armies began to retire as the French Ninth, Fourth and Third Armies fought defensive battles against the 3rd Army which then had to retreat with the 1st and 2nd armies on 9 September.

Further east, the Third Army was forced back to the west of Verdun as German attacks were made on the Meuse Heights to the south-east but managed to maintain contact with Verdun and the Fourth Army to the west. German attacks against the Second Army south of Verdun from 5 September, almost forced the French to retreat but on 8 September, the crisis eased. By 10 September, the German armies west of Verdun were retreating towards the Aisne and the Franco-British were following-up, collecting stragglers and equipment. On 12 September, Joffre ordered an outflanking move to the west and an attack northwards by the Third Army, to cut off the German retreat. The pursuit was too slow and by 14 September, the German armies had dug in north of the Aisne and the Allies met trench lines, rather than rearguards. Frontal attacks by the Ninth, Fifth and Sixth armies were repulsed from which led Joffre to begin the transfer of the Second Army west to the left flank of the Sixth Army, the first phase of the operations to outflank the German armies, which from 17 September to moved the opposing armies through Picardy and Flanders, to the North Sea coast.

====First Battle of the Aisne, 13–28 September====

On 10 September, the French armies and the BEF advanced to exploit the victory of the Marne and the armies on the left flank advanced, opposed only by rearguards. On Joffre ordered outflanking manoeuvres but the advance was too slow to catch the Germans, who on 14 September, began to dig in on high ground on the north bank of the Aisne, which reduced the French advance from to a few local gains. French troops had begun to move westwards on 2 September, over undamaged railways which could move a corps to the left flank in from On 17 September, the French Sixth Army attacked from Soissons to Noyon, with the XIII and IV corps, supported by the 61st and 62nd divisions of the 6th Group of Reserve Divisions, after which the fighting moved north to Lassigny and the French dug in around Nampcel.

The French Second Army arrived from the eastern flank and took over command of the left-hand corps of the Sixth Army, as indications appeared that German troops were also being moved from the eastern flank. The German IX Reserve Corps arrived from Belgium by 15 September and next day attacked with the 1st Army to the south-west with the IV Corps and the 4th and 7th cavalry divisions, against the attempted French envelopment. The attack was cancelled and the corps withdrew behind the right flank of the 1st Army. The 2nd and 9th cavalry divisions were sent next day but the French attack reached Carlepont and Noyon, before being contained on 18 September. In the Battle of Flirey, the German armies attacked from Verdun west to Reims and the Aisne on 20 September, cut the main railway from Verdun to Paris and created the St Mihiel salient. The main German effort remained on the western flank, which the French discovered by intercepting wireless messages. By 28 September, the Aisne front had stabilised and the BEF began to withdraw on the night of with the first troops arriving in the Abbeville area on 

==Prelude==
===German plan===

After the defeat on the Marne, Moltke ordered a retirement to the Aisne by the 1st and 2nd armies on the German right wing and a withdrawal to Reims and a line eastwards past the north of Verdun, by the 3rd, 4th and 5th armies. The 6th and 7th armies were ordered to end their attacks and dig in. The withdrawal was intended to make time for the 7th Army to be transferred from Alsace to the right-wing near the Oise but Franco-British attacks led to the 7th Army being sent to fill the gap between the 1st and 2nd armies instead. Moltke was replaced by Falkenhayn on 14 September, by when the 1st Army had reached the Aisne, with its right flank on the Oise and the 7th Army had assembled on the Aisne, between the 1st and 2nd armies. Further east the 3rd, 4th and 5th armies had dug in from Prosnes to Verdun, secure from frontal attacks. The 1st Army was still vulnerable on its northern flank, to attacks by French troops transferred from the south, which could be moved faster over undamaged railways, than German troops using lines damaged during the Great Retreat. General Wilhelm Groener, head of the Railway Department of the OHL, suggested three alternatives, a frontal attack from the new positions, a defence of the line of the Aisne while reserves were transferred to the right flank or to continue the withdrawal and comprehensively regroup the German armies, ready to conduct an offensive on the right flank.

On 15 September, Falkenhayn wanted to continue the withdrawal and ordered the 1st Army to fall back and dig in from Artems to La Fère and Nouvion-et-Catillon, to protect the right flank from a French offensive, while the 6th Army moved from Lorraine to the western flank, ready for a general offensive to begin progressively on 18 September from the 5th Army in the east, pinning French troops down westwards, until the 6th Army enveloped the French, beyond the right of the 1st Army. The plan was cancelled soon afterwards, when (Colonel) Gerhard Tappen (OHL Operations Branch), reported from a tour of inspection at the front that the French were too exhausted to begin an offensive, that a final push would be decisive and that more withdrawals would compromise the morale of the German troops, after the defeat on the Marne. From Falkenhayn ordered the 1st, 2nd and 7th armies, temporarily under the command of General Karl von Bülow, to attack southwards and the to attack with the intention of weakening the French and preventing troops from being moved westwards. The 6th Army began to move to the western flank on 17 September, ready for a decisive battle () but French attacks on 18 September, led Falkenhayn to order the 6th Army to operate defensively to secure the German flank.

===French plan of attack===
French attempts to advance after the German retirement to the Aisne were frustrated after 14 September, when German troops were discovered to have stopped their retirement and dug in on the north bank of the Aisne. Joffre ordered attacks on the German 1st and 2nd armies but attempts by the Fifth, Ninth and Sixth armies to advance from 15 to 16 September had little success. The Deuxième Bureau (French Military Intelligence) also reported German troop movements from east to west, which led Joffre to continue the transfer of French troops from the east, which had begun on 2 September with the IV Corps and continued on 9 September with the XX Corps, 11 September with the XIII Corps and the XIV Corps on 18 September. The depletion of the French forces in the east, took place just before the Battle of Flirey, a German attack on 20 September against the Third Army on either side of Verdun, the Fifth Army north of Reims and the Sixth Army along the Aisne, which ended with the creation of the St. Mihiel Salient. Joffre maintained the French emphasis on the western flank, after receiving intercepted wireless messages, showing that the Germans were moving an army to the western flank and continued to assemble the Second Army to the north of the Sixth Army. On 24 September the Second Army was attacked and found difficulty in holding ground, rather than advancing around the German flank as intended.

==Battle==
===First phase, 25 September – 4 October===

====Battle of Picardy, 22–26 September====

The French Sixth Army began to advance along the Oise, west of Compiègne on 17 September. French reconnaissance aircraft were grounded during bad weather and cavalry were exhausted, which deprived the French commanders of information. As news reached Joffre that two German corps were moving south from Antwerp, the Sixth Army was forced to end its advance and dig in around Nampcel and Roye. The IV and XIII corps were transferred to the Second Army, along with the 1st, 5th, 8th and 10th Cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Corps (General Louis Conneau), the XIV and XX Corps were withdrawn from the First and the original Second Army to assemble south of Amiens, with a screen of the 81st, 82nd, 84th and 88th Territorial divisions, to protect French communications. The French advanced on 22 September, on a line from Lassigny northwards to Roye and Chaulnes around the German flank but met the German II Corps, which had arrived on the night of on the right flank of the IX Reserve Corps.

Despite the four divisions of the II Cavalry Corps (General Georg von der Marwitz), the Germans were pushed back to a line from Ribécourt to Lassigny and Roye, which menaced German communications through Ham and St. Quentin. On 24 September, the French were attacked by the XVIII Corps as it arrived from Reims, which forced back the French IV Corps at Roye on the right flank. To the north, the French reached Péronne and formed a bridgehead on the east bank of the Somme, only for the German XIV Reserve Corps to reach Bapaume to the north on 26 September. The offensive capacity of the Second Army was exhausted and defensive positions were occupied, while Joffre sent four more corps to reinforce. Over the next week, the northern flank of the Second Army moved further north and on 29 September, a (General Louis de Maud&#x27;huy) was formed, to control the northern corps of the Second Army as they assembled near Arras.

====Battle of Albert, 25–29 September====
On 21 September, Falkenhayn decided to concentrate the 6th Army near Amiens, to attack westwards to the coast and then envelop the French northern flank south of the Somme. The offensive by the French Second Army forced Falkenhayn to divert the XXI and I Bavarian Corps as soon as they arrived, to extend the front northwards from Chaulnes to Péronne on 24 September and drive the French back over the Somme. On 26 September, the French Second Army dug in on a line from Lassigny to Roye and Bray-sur-Somme; German cavalry moved north to enable the II Bavarian Corps to occupy the ground north of the Somme. On 27 September, the German II Cavalry Corps drove back the 61st and 62nd Reserve divisions (General Joseph Brugère, who had replaced General Albert d&#x27;Amade), to clear the front for the XIV Reserve Corps and link with the right flank of the II Bavarian Corps. The French began to assemble at Arras and Maud&#x27;huy found that instead of making another attempt to get around the German flank, the &quot;subdivision&quot; was menaced by a German offensive.

The German II Bavarian and XIV Reserve corps pushed back a French Territorial division from Bapaume and advanced towards Bray-sur-Somme and Albert. From the French XXI and X Corps north of the Somme, with support on the right flank by the 81st, 82nd, 84th and 88th Territorial divisions and the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 10th Cavalry divisions of the French II Cavalry Corps, defended the approaches to Albert. On 28 September, the French were able to stop the German advance on a line from Maricourt to Fricourt and Thiepval. The German II Cavalry Corps was stopped near Arras by the French cavalry. On 29 September, Joffre added X Corps, north of Amiens, to the French II Cavalry Corps south-east of Arras and a provisional corps (General Victor d&#x27;Urbal), which had a Reserve division in Arras and one in Lens, to a new Tenth Army.

===Second phase, 4–15 October===
====First Battle of Arras, 1–4 October====


On 1 October, the French at Arras were pushed back from Guémappe, Wancourt and Monchy-le-Preux, until the arrival of X Corps. By 1 October, two more French corps, three infantry and two cavalry divisions had been sent northwards to Amiens, Arras, Lens and Lille, which increased the Second Army to eight corps, along a front of . Joffre ordered Castelnau to operate defensively, while Maud&#x27;huy and the advanced on Arras. On 28 September, Falkenhayn had ordered the 6th Army to conduct an offensive by the IV, Guard and I Bavarian corps near Arras and more offensives further north. Rupprecht intended to halt the French west of Arras and envelop them around the north side of the city. On 1 October, the French attacked to the south-east, expecting only a cavalry screen.

The Germans attacked from Arras to Douai on 1 October, forestalling the French. On 3 October, Rupprecht reinforced the 6th Army north of Arras and ordered the IV Cavalry Corps from Valenciennes to Lille. From 3 to 4 October, German attacks on Arras and the vicinity were costly failures. On 4 October, German troops entered Lens, Souchez, Neuville-Saint-Vaast and gained a footing on the Lorette Spur. German attacks were made from the north of Arras to reach the Scarpe but were eventually repulsed by X Corps. By 4 October, German troops had also reached Givenchy-en-Gohelle and on the right flank of the French further south, the Territorial divisions were separated from X Corps, prompting Castelnau and Maud&#x27;huy to recommend a retreat. Joffre made Maud&#x27;huy&#x27;s independent as the Tenth Army and told Castelnau to keep the Second Army in position because the increasing number of troops arriving further north would divert German pressure.

By 6 October, the Second Army front from the Oise to the Somme and the Tenth Army front from Thiepval to Arras and Souchez had been stabilised. A German cavalry attack to the north of the 6th Army, pushed back the French Territorial divisions from Lens to Lille and on 5 October, Marwitz ordered the cavalry to advance westwards to Abbeville on the Channel coast and cut the railways leading south. At the end of 6 October, Falkenhayn terminated attempts by the 2nd Army to break through in Picardy. To the north, I Cavalry Corps and II Cavalry Corps attacked between Lens and Lille, quickly being forced back behind the Lorette Spur. The next day, the cavalry was attacked by the first troops of the French XXI Corps to arrive as they advanced eastwards from Béthune.

===Third phase, 15 October–November===
====Battle of La Bassée, 10 October – 2 November====


The German 6th Army took Lille before a British force could secure the town and the 4th Army attacked the exposed British flank at Ypres. On 9 October, the German XIV Corps arrived opposite the French and the German 1st and 2nd Cavalry corps tried a flanking move between La Bassée and Armentières but the French cavalry stopped the Germans north of La Bassée Canal. The German 4th Cavalry Corps passed through Ypres on 7 October and was forced back to Bailleul by French Territorial troops. From the British II Corps arrived by rail at Abbeville and advanced on Béthune. By the end of 11 October, II Corps held a line from Béthune to Hinges and Chocques, with flanking units on the right, south of Béthune and on the left to the west. On 12 October, II Corps attacked to reach Givenchy and Pont du Hem, north of La Bassée Canal. The German I and II Cavalry corps and attached tried to delay the advance but the British repulsed a counter-attack near Givenchy.

From 14 to 15 October, II Corps attacked eastwards up La Bassée Canal and managed short advances on the flanks, with help from French cavalry but lost From the corps attacks pivoted on the right and the left flank advanced to Aubers against German opposition at every ditch and bridge. A foothold was established on Aubers Ridge on 17 October and French cavalry captured Fromelles. On 18 October, the German XIII Corps arrived, reinforced the VII Corps and gradually forced the British II Corps to a halt. On 19 October, parties of British infantry and French cavalry captured the village of Le Pilly, which later was recaptured by the Germans. The fresh German 13th and 14th divisions arrived and counter-attacked the II Corps front. By 21 October, II Corps was ordered to dig in from the canal near Givenchy to Violaines, Illies, Herlies and Riez, while offensive operations continued to the north. The Lahore Division of the Indian Corps arrived and the British repulsed German attacks until early November, when both sides concentrated their resources on the First Battle of Ypres and the battle at La Bassée ended.

====Battle of Messines, 12 October – 2 November====

The III Corps reached St. Omer and Hazebrouck from then advanced eastwards towards Lille. The British cavalry advanced and found the Germans dug in on Mont des Cats and at Flêtre on the road from Cassel to Bailleul. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade attacked Mont des Cats and occupied Mt. Noir, north of Bailleul. On 14 October, the cavalry advanced north-eastwards, occupied Dranoutre and Kemmel against slight opposition, then reached a line from Dranoutre to Wytschaete (Wijtschate), linking with the 3rd Cavalry Division of IV Corps, which had been operating in Belgium since early October.

On 15 October, Estaires was captured by French cavalry but the Germans prevented an advance beyond Comines, west of Menin (Menen), where German troops had arrived during the night. A foothold was gained at Warneton and German outposts west of the Ypres–Comines canal were pushed back to the far side. By 16 October, the Cavalry Corps and the 3rd Cavalry Division held the Lys river from Armentières to Comines and the Comines canal to Ypres. The BEF was ordered to make a general advance on 16 October, as the German forces were falling back. The cavalry was ordered to cross the Lys between Armentières and Menin as the III Corps advanced north-east to gain touch with the 7th Division near Ypres.

Fog grounded Royal Flying Corps (RFC) reconnaissance aircraft and made artillery observation impossible. The Lys was wide and deep and flanked by water meadows. The banks were cut by boggy streams and dykes, which kept the cavalry on the roads; German outposts were pushed back but dismounted cavalry attacks could not dislodge the German defenders and the cavalry in Warneton town were withdrawn during the night. The attack was resumed on 18 October, when the cavalry attacked from Deûlémont to Tenbrielen but made no progress against a strong and well-organised German defence, ending the day opposite Deûlémont in the south to the railway at Tenbrielen to the north. From the Cavalry Corps had The encounter battle ended and subsequent operations in the Battle of Messines took place after the end of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot;.

====Battle of Armentières, 13 October – 2 November====

On 11 October, the British III Corps comprising the 4th and 6th divisions arrived by rail at St. Omer and Hazebrouck and then advanced behind the left flank of II Corps, towards Bailleul and Armentières. II Corps was to advance around the north of Lille and III Corps was to reach a line from Armentières to Wytschaete, with the Cavalry Corps (Lieutenant-General Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby) on the left as far as Ypres. French troops were to relieve the II Corps at Béthune to move north and link with the right of III Corps but this did not occur. On the northern flank of III Corps, in front of the Cavalry Corps, was a line of hills from Mont des Cats to Mt. Kemmel, about above sea level, with spurs running south across the British line of advance, occupied by the German IV Cavalry Corps with three divisions. On 12 October, the British cavalry advanced and captured the Mont des Cats.

On 13 October, III Corps found German troops dug in along the Meterenbecque. A corps attack from La Couronne to Fontaine Houck began at in wet and misty weather and by evening had captured Outtersteene and Méteren, at a cost of On the right, French cavalry attempted to support the attack but without howitzers, could not advance in level terrain, dotted with cottages used as improvised strong points. The German defenders slipped away from defences in front of houses, hedges and walls, well sighted to keep the soldiers invisible, dug earth having been scattered rather than used for a parapet, which would have been visible. III Corps was to attack the next German line of defence before German reinforcements could reach the scene. Rain and mist made air reconnaissance impossible on 14 October but patrols found that the Germans had fallen back beyond Bailleul and crossed the Lys.

Allied forces completed a continuous line to the North Sea when British cavalry and infantry reached a line from Steenwerck–Dranoutre, after a slow advance against German rearguards, in poor visibility and close country. III Corps closed up to the river at Sailly, Bac St. Maur, Erquinghem and Pont de Nieppe, linking with the cavalry at Romarin. On 16 October, the British secured the Lys crossings and late in the afternoon, German attacks began at Diksmuide and the next day the III Corps occupied Armentières. On 18 October, the III Corps was ordered to join an offensive by the BEF and the French army, by attacking down the Lys valley. Part of Pérenchies ridge was captured but much stronger German defences were encountered and the infantry were ordered to dig in. On the night of the III Corps held a line from Radinghem to Pont Rouge, west of Lille. The encounter battle ended and subsequent operations in the Battle of Armentières took place after the end of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; during the First Battle of Ypres November).

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
From 17 September to 17 October, the belligerents had made unsuccessful reciprocal attempts to turn the northern flank of their opponent. A German offensive began by 21 October but the 4th and 6th armies were only able to take small amounts of ground at great cost to both sides, at the Battle of the Yser and further south at Ypres. Falkenhayn then attempted to achieve a limited goal of capturing Ypres and Mount Kemmel, in the First Battle of Ypres By 8 November, Falkenhayn concluded that the attempt to advance along the coast had failed and that taking Ypres was impossible. The French and Germans had not been able to assemble forces near the northern flank fast enough to obtain a decisive advantage. Where the opposing forces had attempted to advance, they had quickly been stopped and forced to improvise field defences, against which attacks were costly failures. By the end of the First Battle of Ypres both sides were exhausted, short of ammunition and suffering from collapses in morale and refusals of orders by some infantry units.

In October 1914, French and British artillery commanders met to discuss means for supporting infantry attacks, the British practice being to keep the artillery silent until targets were identified and the French firing a (preliminary bombardment) which ceased as the infantry began the assault. A moving barrage of fire was proposed as a combination of both methods and became a standard practice later in the war as guns and ammunition were accumulated in sufficient quantity. Falkenhayn issued memoranda on 7 and 25 January 1915, defining a theory of defensive warfare to be used on the Western Front, intended to enable ground to be held with the fewest possible troops. By economising on manpower in the west, a larger number of divisions could be sent to the Eastern Front.

The front line was to be fortified to enable its defence with small numbers of troops indefinitely and the captured ground was to be recovered by counter-attacks. A second trench was to be dug behind the front line, to shelter the trench garrison and to have easy access to the front line, through covered communication trenches. Should counter-attacks fail to recover the front trench, a rearward line was to be connected to the remaining parts of the front line, limiting the loss of ground to a bend () in the line, rather than a breakthrough. The building of the new defences took until the autumn of 1915 and confronted Franco-British offensives with an evolving system of field fortifications, which was able to absorb the increasing power and sophistication of breakthrough attempts.
During the mobile operations of 1914, armies operating in hostile territory had relied on wireless communication to a far greater extent than anticipated, having expected to use telegraphs, telephones and dispatch riders. None of the armies had established cryptographic systems sufficient to prevent eavesdropping and all of the armies sent messages containing vital information in plain language. From September–November, the British and French intercepted messages, which showed the disorganisation of the German command in mid-September and the gap between the 1st and 2nd armies on the eve of the Battle of the Marne. Similar plain language messages and the reading of crudely coded German messages, gave warnings to the British of the times, places and strengths of eight attacks by four German corps or more, during the Race to the Sea and the battles in Flanders.

===Casualties===
By the end of the battles at Ypres, German army casualties in the west were including The French army casualty total from was which, with losses of from gave a total of by the end of the year. In 2001, Strachan recorded German casualties at Ypres, casualties since the beginning of the war, at Ypres) and that per cent of the Belgian army had become casualties.

==Subsequent operations==
===First Battle of Flanders===

====Battle of the Yser, 18 October – 30 November====

During the Allied retreat from Antwerp, the British IV Corps moved north of Ypres on 14 October, where I Corps arrived on 19 October, with cavalry covering a gap to the south of the town. The Battle of the Yser was fought, along a stretch of the Yser river and Yperlee Canal in Belgium. Falkenhayn created a new 4th Army to capture Dunkirk and Calais to inflict an &quot;annihilating blow&quot;. The retreat of the Belgians to the Yser ended the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot;, with the Belgians holding a front southwards from the coast and Belgian, French and British troops holding another beyond, the BEF holding and the Tenth Army holding another on the extreme right flank of the northern front.

German attacks began on 18 October and on 22 October German troops gained a foothold over the river at Tervaete. The French 42nd Division at Nieuwpoort was sent as reinforcements on 23 October, when the Belgians were pushed back between Diksmuide and Nieuwpoort. German heavy artillery was countered on the coast by Allied ships under British command, which forced Germans to attack further inland. On 24 October, fifteen German attacks crossed the Yser for and the French sent the rest of the 42nd Division. By 26 October, the Belgian Commander General Félix Wielemans, had decided to retreat but French objections and orders from King Albert led to a withdrawal being cancelled. The next day, the Belgians opened sluice gates on the coast at Nieuwpoort, flooding the area between the Yser and the railway embankment. On 30 October, a German attack crossed the embankment at Ramscapelle but was repulsed on the following evening; the inundations reduced the fighting to local operations.

====First Battle of Ypres, 19 October – 22 November====

The First Battle of Ypres (part of the First Battle of Flanders) began on 19 October, with attacks by the German 6th and 4th armies, as the BEF attacked towards Menin and Roeselare (Roulers). On 21 October, the 4th Army was repulsed in mutually costly fighting and from the Germans attacked on the Yser with the 4th Army and with the 6th Army to the south. French attacks by a new Eighth Army were made towards Roeselare and Torhout (Thourout), which diverted German troops from British and Belgian positions. A new German attack was planned where the 4th and 6th armies would pin down Allied troops and with six new divisions and more than guns, attacked north-west between Messines and Gheluvelt, against the British I Corps. The Germans took ground on the Menin road on 29 October and drove back the British cavalry next day, to a line from Ypres.

<doc id="839725" wikidata="Q545680" url="?curid=839725" title="Srpska Crnja">
<text>Srpska Crnja (; Hungarian: &quot;Szerbcsernye&quot;; Romanian: &quot;Cernea Neamț&quot;) is a village in Serbia, situated in central-east Banat alongside the border with Romania. It is located in Nova Crnja municipality, Central Banat District, Province of Vojvodina. It is about 120 km (74.6 mi) away from the capital city of Belgrade, 113 km (70.2 mi) from Novi Sad, 9 km (5.6 mi) south-east of Kikinda and 6 km (3.7 mi) south-west of Jimbolia, Romania. The village has a population of 3753 people (2011 census) and most of its inhabitants are ethnic Serbs (83.77%).

==Name==
Name of the village comes from Serbian words &quot;srpska&quot; (meaning &quot;Serb&quot;, &quot;Serbian&quot;) and &quot;crno&quot; (meaning &quot;black&quot;). In Serbian the village is known as Srpska Crnja / Српска Црња (formerly also Crnja / Црња), in German as &quot;Serbisch-Zerne&quot; or &quot;Serbish Zerne&quot;, and in Hungarian as &quot;Szerbcsernye&quot; (formerly also &quot;Csernye&quot;, &quot;Czernya&quot;, &quot;Rácz-Czernya&quot;, and &quot;Szerb-Csernya&quot;).

Former German-populated settlement that is now part of this village was known as &quot;Nemačka Crnja&quot; (Немачка Црња) in Serbian, &quot;Deutsch-Zerne&quot; or &quot;Deutsch-Tschernja&quot; in German, and &quot;Németcsernye&quot; or &quot;Nemacske-Csernye&quot; in Hungarian.

==Geography==
Although Srpska Crnja is the largest settlement in Nova Crnja municipality, the municipal center is located in the village of Nova Crnja, since this settlement has a more favourable geographic position. The former railroad that linked Srpska Crnja to other settlements is no longer operational.

==History==
Srpska Crnja is an old settlement. The first historical records mentioning the settlement are from 1373. In this time, it was part of the Temesiensis County within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In the 16th-17th century, it was part of the Ottoman Empire and administratively belonged to the Temeşvar Eyalet. It was recorded as populated settlement in 1660, but was later resettled. In this time, it was known as Crnja and was populated by ethnic Serbs.

In the first half of the 18th century, this area was included into the Habsburg monarchy, but Crnja was without inhabitants in this time. The first time it appeared on a map was in 1723. In the middle of the 18th century, Crnja was populated by Serbs and Romanians. Until 1778, the village was part of the Banat of Temeswar, which was a separate Habsburg land. In 1778, it was included into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and was administratively a part of the Torontal County. In 1787, population of the village numbered 1,394 residents. In 1790, German colonists founded a new settlement nearby and it was named Nemačka Crnja i.e. the &quot;German Crnja&quot;. It was located in the north-east from the original settlement. The older settlement, hence, became known as Srpska Crnja i.e. the &quot;Serb Crnja&quot;.

In 1848-1849, the area was part of the autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and in 1849-1860 part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian land. After abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the area was again included into Torontal County. In 1910, Srpska Crnja had a Serb ethnic majority, while Nemačka Crnja had a German ethnic majority. Before the First World War, population of Srpska Crnja numbered 3,924 residents, while population of Nemačka Crnja numbered 3,392 residents. If population of two settlements is counted together, largest ethnic group in the area were Serbs.

In 1918, as part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region, the area was firstly included into the Kingdom of Serbia and then into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922 the area was part of the Veliki Bečkerek County, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Belgrade Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. Between the two World Wars, some families of Serbian World War I volunteers were settled in the area. In 1931, population of both settlements numbered 9,100 people.

During the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia in World War II, from 1941 to 1944, the area was included into the German-administered Banat region that had special status within the Axis puppet state of Serbia. The German population of Nemačka Crnja numbered over 3,000 people in 1944. At the end of World War II, in 1944, one part of local German inhabitants left from the area, together with defeated German army. Those who remained in the region were sent to local communist prison camps. After communist prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Yugoslavia mainly because of economic reasons.

Since 1944, the area was part of Yugoslav Vojvodina, which, from 1945, was an autonomous province of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia. After the war, some Serb families from Bosnia settled in the area. In that time, two settlements were administratively joined into the single village. In recent times, population of the village is decreasing. As a result of the current bad economic situation in the Banat region, a sizable number of local Serbs is emigrating to large Serbian cities or to other countries (like Austria and Germany), searching for jobs.

<text>David Samuel Cohen (born July 13, 1966), better known as David X. Cohen, is an American television writer. He is best known for co-developing the animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;.

==Early life==
Cohen was born in New York City as David Samuel Cohen. He changed his middle initial around the time &quot;Futurama&quot; debuted due to Writers&#x27; Guild policies prohibiting more than one member from having the same name. Both of his parents were biologists, and growing up Cohen had always planned to be a scientist, though he also enjoyed drawing cartoons and writing. Cohen is of Jewish background.

Cohen graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, New Jersey, where he wrote the humor column for the high school paper and was a member of the school&#x27;s state champion mathematics team. Cohen graduated from Harvard University with a B.A. in physics, and the University of California, Berkeley, with a M.S. in computer science. At Harvard, he wrote for and served as President of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

In high school, Cohen wrote in MOS 6502 assembly language, an Apple II compiler, and video game, and unsuccessfully tried to publish the latter through Broderbund. His most notable academic publication concerned the theoretical computer science problem of pancake sorting.

==Writing career==
After three years of graduate school, Cohen took a leave of absence and started writing sample TV scripts. In 1992, this landed him a job writing two of the earliest &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; episodes. In 1993, Cohen began working on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, writing or co-writing thirteen episodes. Nearly five years later, Cohen would team with Matt Groening to develop &quot;Futurama&quot;, where he served as writer or co-writer of seven episodes and executive producer, head writer, and showrunner of the series&#x27; entire run. Cohen has won four Primetime Emmy Awards: Two for &quot;Futurama&quot; and two for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

===&quot;Futurama&quot;===

Cohen co-developed &quot;Futurama&quot;, along with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening. Cohen served as head writer, executive producer, co-showrunner, and voice director of the series. He was also the voice director of the &quot;Futurama&quot; video game. After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with Cohen in 1997 and developed &quot;Futurama&quot;, an animated series about life in the year 3000. By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines; Groening claimed they had &quot;gone overboard&quot; in their discussions. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as &quot;by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life&quot;. The show premiered on March 28, 1999.

After four years on the air, the series was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to the animated &quot;Family Guy&quot;, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Comedy Central brought Futurama back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air &quot;Futurama&quot; reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films—&quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2008), &quot;&quot; (2008) and &quot;&quot; (2009)—would be produced. Since no new &quot;Futurama&quot; projects were in production, the movie &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot; was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the &quot;Futurama&quot; franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that &quot;we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don&#x27;t know... We&#x27;re having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just me.&quot;

Comedy Central picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes that began airing in mid-2010.

Cohen told &quot;Newsday&quot; in August 2009 that the reported 26-episode order means &quot;[i]t will be up to 26. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will be 26. But I think there&#x27;s a pretty good chance it&#x27;ll be exactly 26. Fox has been a little bit cagey about it, even internally. But nobody&#x27;s too concerned. We&#x27;re plunging ahead.&quot; Two episodes were in the process of being voice-recorded at that time, with an additional &quot;six scripts ... in the works, ranging in scale from &#x27;it&#x27;s a crazy idea that someone&#x27;s grandmother thought of&#x27; to &#x27;it&#x27;s all on paper&#x27;. ...&quot;The first episode is tentatively titled &#x27;Rebirth&#x27; — and in a surprisingly literal fashion, as things turn out&quot;. It aired June 24 on Comedy Central.

Cohen designed one of the robots in the robot strip club which he said was &quot;his one artistic contribution to the show&quot;. The robot&#x27;s waist gyrated sexily using a planetary gear. In an episode&#x27;s commentary, this artistic contribution is discussed by &quot;Futurama&quot; co-creator Matt Groening, who describes Cohen as being very particular about how the animators used his design, and that Cohen&#x27;s original drawing is still framed in his office.

He makes some brief cameo appearances in cartoon form, first in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;A Bicyclops Built for Two&quot;, along with several other people who worked on the show, and second on &quot;I Dated a Robot&quot; as a member of the eBay audience. Both appearances are pointed out during DVD commentaries.

===Name change===
When the FOX primetime animated shows unionized in 1998, Cohen was forced to use a different name for professional purposes, as there was already another member credited as David S. Cohen (who worked on &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;). The Writers Guild of America does not allow multiple members to use the same name for onscreen credits. Instead of using his full middle name, he chose to use the middle initial &quot;X&quot;—because it sounded &quot;sci-fi-ish&quot;—and has jokingly said that the &quot;X&quot; would make him &quot;the David Cohen people would remember&quot;. The &quot;X&quot; does not actually stand for anything, but Cohen included a period &quot;so people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s some mathematical formula: &#x27;David times Cohen&#x27; or something&quot;.

Cohen has also been credited with inventing the word &quot;cromulent&quot;, meaning &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa the Iconoclast&quot;. Subsequently, the word was included in Webster&#x27;s New Millennium Dictionary. The meaning of &quot;cromulent&quot; is inferred only from its usage, which indicates that it is a positive attribute. Webster&#x27;s Dictionary defines it as meaning &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot;.

<doc id="839740" wikidata="Q1568447" url="?curid=839740" title="Hagen (legend)">
<text>Hagen (German form) or Högni (&quot;Old Norse&quot; Hǫgni, often anglicized as Hogni, &quot;Old English&quot; Hagena, &quot;Latin&quot; Hagano) is a Burgundian warrior in Germanic heroic legend about the Burgundian kingdom at Worms. Hagen is often identified as a brother or half-brother of King Gunther (Old Norse &quot;Gunnarr&quot;). In the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; he is nicknamed &quot;from Tronje&quot;.

==Etymology of the epithet &quot;Tronje&quot;==

Of the main manuscripts of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, the chief representatives of versions B and C use the spelling &quot;Tronege&quot;: &quot;from Tronege Hagene&quot;, &quot;Hagen of Tronege&quot;, &quot;geborn of Tronege&quot;, &quot;helt of Tronege&quot;. The A version usually writes &quot;Trony&quot; (also &quot;Troni&quot; and &quot;Tronie&quot;). &quot;Tronje&quot; is the appropriate modern German form. In the B and C versions, the name is in the dative case, with the nominative being &quot;Troneg&quot;; &quot;Tronje&quot;, although common, is therefore a mistake.

All attempts to interpret Hagen&#x27;s name or home are highly speculative. Although the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; has a historic center, it was written down only centuries later, in 1200, and therefore incorporated the author&#x27;s Medieval knowledge and intentions. There are suggestions that the epithet refers to more or less similar-sounding place names. However, names that have only a phonetic similarity but no meaningful link with the legend are rejected by scholars, since it is very likely that such connections are random and add nothing to the interpretation of the character. It is believed that the poet of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; accepted Tronje as a real place name in the Burgundian kingdom; but it is questionable that he himself knew its exact location, since the story&#x27;s many geographical mistakes suggest that his knowledge of the area around Worms was not particularly good.

Nevertheless, a link to Hagen has been discussed regarding the following places:

* The suffix &quot;of Tronje&quot; could signify a derivation from the Greek &quot;Troy&quot;, since it was fashionable in late antiquity and early medieval Europe to ascribe such ancestors to oneself. With this ascription, people could also connect themselves to the ancient Romans.
* &quot;Tronje&quot; could also be the Colonia Ulpia Traiana, a Roman city close to modern Xanten, and the area from which Siegfried came. This would explain Hagen&#x27;s seemingly profound knowledge of incidents and deeds from Siegfried&#x27;s youth.
* The Belgian city of Drongen in Ghent was known in Latin as &quot;Truncinas&quot; and had various Romanesque spellings over the following centuries: &quot;Truncinas&quot; (820–822), &quot;Truncinis&quot; (1040) and &quot;Troncinium&quot; (1198). Today, its French name is &quot;Tronchiennes&quot;, which sounds almost like &quot;Tronje&quot;. Dutch authors place the &quot;Kudrun&quot; saga here since it contains townscape and landscape names such as &quot;Wulpe Tenenbaums&quot; (Tenemarke, Tenelant). According to this interpretation, Hagen of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; could be identical with the Hagen of the &quot;Kudrun&quot;.
* Similarly, the name of the small village of Castle Dhronecken in the Hunsrück Mountains sounds like &quot;Tronje&quot;; in the Middle Ages its name was &quot;Troneck&quot; and it lay in the historic Kingdom of the Burgundians. Not too far away, there are place names that hint at further figures from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, especially Hagen&#x27;s relative Ortwin of Metz and his colleagues Hunold and Volker von Alzey. Based on the castles around Dhronecken, Ortwin can be assigned to Metz, Hagen to Dhronecken, Hunold to Hunoldispetra (now Hunolstein in Morbach), and Volker to Alzey. These are places that travelers would pass on the way from Xanten via Metz and Worms to Passau.

==Nibelungenlied==

In the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, he is called Hagen of Tronje.

Some versions indicate that Hagen is the &quot;Oheim&quot; of the three kings, i.e. their mother Ute&#x27;s brother (or brother-in-law, following a now outdated German dual model of indicating and differing between matrilineal and patrilineal kinship). Some count him as Gunter&#x27;s, Gernot&#x27;s and Giselher&#x27;s &quot;uncle&quot; (originally a father&#x27;s brother or brother-in-law, as opposed to &quot;Oheim&quot;), so this may more likely hint to an old custom - nearly, but not yet completely outdated - where people close to a family take over the role of a fatherly / motherly friend and acquire the &quot;honorary title&quot; of an uncle or aunt (see the German expression &#x27;Nennonkel/-tante&#x27; - &#x27;termed uncle / -aunt&#x27;). In the German traditions, Hagen is especially grim, implacable, and violent, and in two accounts, one-eyed.

According to the &quot;Thidreks saga&quot;, Hagen was Gunnar&#x27;s (senior?) half-brother. Not fully human, though, as being fathered by an elf, on the king&#x27;s wife while the king was away. The &quot;Thidreks saga&quot; tells that it was Walter of Waskensten (Walter of Aquitaine) who put out Hagen&#x27;s eye in a fight.

In these forementioned accounts, it is Hagen who kills the hero Siegfried during a hunt, wounding him on the only part of his body which was not invulnerable. This version of the character is the most widely known and appears in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. In Norse tradition, Hagen&#x27;s counterpart Högni is less extreme and the actual slayer of Sigurd (the Norse counterpart to Siegfried) is Gutthorm, a younger brother of Gunnar and Högni, who does so when egged on by his elder brothers.

In German accounts, Gunther and Hagen, along with Kriemhild herself, are the final casualties of the fall of the Nibelungs. Hagen refuses to reveal the hiding place of the Nibelung treasure to Kriemhild as long as his king Gunther lives. When Gunther is slain, the mortally wounded Hagen continues his refusal with sure knowledge that Gunther cannot now weaken and betray the secret, being decapitated by Kriemhild with Balmung, Siegfried&#x27;s sword which Hagen had stolen after his death.

==Norse accounts==

In Norse accounts, however, it is Gunnar who refuses to tell the secret to Attila the Hun as long as Högni lives, and so brings about Högni&#x27;s death. Högni laughs as Attila has his heart cut out.

In &quot;Atlamál&quot;, Hniflung, a son of Hagen/Högni, avenges his father&#x27;s death and the deaths of his kin, together with his aunt Guðrún. This work also states that Hogni had a wife named Kostbera and two other sons: Solar and Snævar. The Drap Niflunga mentions a fourth son named Gjuki (named after Hogni&#x27;s father).

==Wagnerian mythology==
In the opera &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, part of &quot;The Ring Cycle&quot;, Hagen is portrayed as the half-brother of Gunther and Gutrune, illegitimately fathered by the dwarf Alberich. He is similarly depicted as evil and cunning, acting under the influence of his father and for his own interests.

The great German bass Kurt Moll pointed out that Hagen&#x27;s music is unique in the bass repertoire: it requires a shouting, blaring vocal technique which risks damaging the singer&#x27;s voice; only very large-voiced, powerful singers can sing it.
