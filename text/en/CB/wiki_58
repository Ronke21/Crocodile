<text>Leukotrienes are a family of eicosanoid inflammatory mediators produced in leukocytes by the oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) by the enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase.

Leukotrienes use lipid signaling to convey information to either the cell producing them (autocrine signaling) or neighboring cells (paracrine signaling) in order to regulate immune responses. The production of leukotrienes is usually accompanied by the production of histamine and prostaglandins, which also act as inflammatory mediators.

One of their roles (specifically, leukotriene D4) is to trigger contractions in the smooth muscles lining the bronchioles; their overproduction is a major cause of inflammation in asthma and allergic rhinitis. Leukotriene antagonists are used to treat these disorders by inhibiting the production or activity of leukotrienes.

== History and name ==
The name &quot;leukotriene&quot;, introduced by Swedish biochemist Bengt Samuelsson in 1979, comes from the words &quot;leukocyte&quot; and &quot;triene&quot; (indicating the compound&#x27;s three conjugated double bonds).
What would be later named leukotriene C, &quot;slow reaction smooth muscle-stimulating substance&quot; (SRS) was originally described between 1938 and 1940 by Feldberg and Kellaway. The researchers isolated SRS from lung tissue after a prolonged period following exposure to snake venom and histamine.

==Types==

===Cysteinyl leukotrienes===
LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and LTF4 are often called cysteinyl leukotrienes due to the presence of the amino acid cysteine in their structure. The cysteinyl leukotrienes make up the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A). LTF4, like LTD4, is a metabolite of LTC4, but, unlike LTD4, which lacks the glutamic residue of glutathione, LTF4 lacks the glycine residue of glutathione.

===LTB4===

LTB4 is synthesized &quot;in vivo&quot; from LTA4 by the enzyme LTA4 hydrolase. Its primary function is to recruit neutrophils to areas of tissue damage, though it also helps promote the production of inflammatory cytokines by various immune cells. Drugs that block the actions of LTB4 have shown some efficacy in slowing the progression of neutrophil-mediated diseases.

===LTG4===
There has also been postulated the existence of LTG4, a metabolite of LTE4 in which the cysteinyl moiety has been oxidized to an alpha-keto-acid (i.e.—the cysteine has been replaced by a pyruvate). Very little is known about this putative leukotriene.

===LTB5===
Leukotrienes originating from the omega-3 class eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) have diminished inflammatory effects. In human subjects whose diets have been supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid, leukotrine B5, along with leukotrine B4, is produced by neutrophils. LTB5 induces aggregation of rat neutrophils, chemokinesis of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), lysosomal enzyme release from human PMN and potentiation of bradykinin-induced plasma exudation, although compared to LTB4, it has at least 30 times less potency.

== Biochemistry ==
=== Synthesis === 

Leukotrienes are synthesized in the cell from arachidonic acid by arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase. The catalytic mechanism involves the insertion of an oxygen moiety at a specific position in the arachidonic acid backbone.

The lipoxygenase pathway is active in leukocytes and other immunocompetent cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils. When such cells are activated, arachidonic acid is liberated from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, and donated by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) to 5-lipoxygenase.

5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) uses FLAP to convert arachidonic acid into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which spontaneously reduces to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). The enzyme 5-LO acts again on 5-HETE to convert it into leukotriene A4 (LTA4), an unstable epoxide. 5-HETE can be further metabolized to 5-oxo-ETE and 5-oxo-15-hydroxy-ETE, all of which have pro-inflammatory actions similar but not identical to those of LTB4 and mediated not by LTB4 receptors but rather by the OXE receptor (see 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid).

In cells equipped with LTA hydrolase, such as neutrophils and monocytes, LTA4 is converted to the dihydroxy acid leukotriene LTB4, which is a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils acting at BLT1 and BLT2 receptors on the plasma membrane of these cells.

In cells that express LTC4 synthase, such as mast cells and eosinophils, LTA4 is conjugated with the tripeptide glutathione to form the first of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes, LTC4. Outside the cell, LTC4 can be converted by ubiquitous enzymes to form successively LTD4 and LTE4, which retain biological activity.

The cysteinyl-leukotrienes act at their cell-surface receptors CysLT1 and CysLT2 on target cells to contract bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, to increase permeability of small blood vessels, to enhance secretion of mucus in the airway and gut, and to recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation.

Both LTB4 and the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are partly degraded in local tissues, and ultimately become inactive metabolites in the liver.

=== Function ===
Leukotrienes act principally on a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. They may also act upon peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Leukotrienes are involved in asthmatic and allergic reactions and act to sustain inflammatory reactions. Several leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast are used to treat asthma. Recent research points to a role of 5-lipoxygenase in cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric illnesses.

Leukotrienes are very important agents in the inflammatory response. Some such as LTB4 have a chemotactic effect on migrating neutrophils, and as such help to bring the necessary cells to the tissue. Leukotrienes also have a powerful effect in bronchoconstriction and increase vascular permeability.

==Leukotrienes in asthma==
Leukotrienes contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma, especially in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and cause or potentiate the following symptoms:
*Airflow obstruction
*Increased secretion of mucus
*Mucosal accumulation
*Bronchoconstriction
*Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airway wall

===Role of cysteinyl leukotrienes===
Cysteinyl leukotriene receptors CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2 are present on mast cells, eosinophil, and endothelial cells. During cysteinyl leukotriene interaction, they can stimulate proinflammatory activities such as endothelial cell adherence and chemokine production by mast cells. As well as mediating inflammation, they induce asthma and other inflammatory disorders, thereby reducing the airflow to the alveoli. The levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes, along with 8-isoprostane, have been reported to be increased in the EBC of patients with asthma, correlating with disease severity. Cysteinyl leukotrienes may also play a role in adverse drug reactions in general and in contrast medium induced adverse reactions in particular.

In excess, the cysteinyl leukotrienes can induce anaphylactic shock.

==Leukotrienes in dementia==
Leukotrienes are found to play an important role in the later stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and related dementias in studies with animals. In tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology, &quot;zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme&quot; was found to reverse memory loss.

<text>William Mervine (14 March 1791 – 15 September 1868) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy, whose career included service in the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mervine was appointed midshipman in January 1809. Serving on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812, he later cruised off Africa and South America, in the West Indies and in the Pacific.

While in command of the during the war with Mexico, 1846 and 1847, he led a detachment of sailors and United States Marines against Monterey, California, and on 7 July 1846, took possession and hoisted the American flag over the city. On 7–9 October 1846, Mervine led 203 U.S. Marines, 147 American sailors, and volunteers in the invasion of Los Angeles where he lost the Battle of Dominguez Rancho. Fourteen Marines were killed. José Antonio Carrillo, a Californio rancher, led 50 Spanish Californio lancers in that defeat of Mervine and the American forces.

== US Civil War Service==
On 7 May 1861, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles appointed the 70-year-old Captain Mervine to command the Gulf Blockading Squadron within the Gulf of Mexico. The assignment was difficult and arduous. Ship Island, MS was deemed to be &quot;indispensable&quot; and must be taken to control the maritime traffic. However on 22 September 1861, he was removed as commander of the blockade force by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. He stated he found it &quot;difficult to understand the reasons for the apparent inactivity and indifference that have governed in this matter. You have large ships, heavy batteries, and young and willing officers, with men sufficient to dispossess the insurgents from Ship Island.&quot; Captain Mervine&#x27;s removal was seconded by the fact that he had been suffering from illness. He was reassigned and worked until late 1865.

He died at Utica, New York on 15 September 1868 at the age of 77 years. He is buried at the Forest Hill Cemetery located in Utica.

==US Navy==

The Navy has named two destroyers in his honor.
* USS Mervine (DD-322) was a Clemson-class destroyer in service with the US Navy from 1921 to 1930. She was scrapped in 1931.
* USS Mervine (DD-489) was a Greaves-class destroyer in service with the US Navy from 1942 to 1949. She remained in reserve until 1969 she was sold for scrapping.

<text>Dog [[crossbreed]]s (sometimes called designer dogs) are dogs which have been intentionally bred from two or more recognized dog breeds. They are not dogs with no purebred ancestors, but are not otherwise recognised as breeds in their own right, and do not necessarily breed true.

Dog crossbreeds are combinations of lineages of the domestic dog; they are distinguished from canid hybrids, which are interspecific crosses between &quot;Canis&quot; species (wolves, coyotes, jackals, etc.).

== Working crossbreeds ==
Several types of working dog crossbreeds date from the 14th century or earlier, such as the lurcher or the longdog.

Historically, crosses between dogs of different types were more well accepted at a time when modern purebred breeds (based on the eugenics principles) did not yet exist. These types of crosses were performed to aggregate qualities of two different types in the same dog or to perfect an already fixed type of dog, always for working purposes. An example to be cited is the famous case of Lord Orford&#x27;s Greyhounds, which were improved by adding courage through the crossing with Old English Bulldogs, achieving the desired result after six generations. With the success of Lord Orford&#x27;s dogs, the practice was adopted by other Greyhound breeders and became more common.

Crossbreeding has played a key characteristic in the development of sled dogs with various crossbreeds developing to meet the specific needs of the era and geographical region, including the Mackenzie River husky, in which European breeds were crossed with Native American dogs to produce a powerful and hardy freighting dog in the 19th century, and the Alaskan husky, bred specifically for sled dog racing. In the 1980s, a rise in Nordic-style sled racing in Scandinavia, characterized by shorter distances than typically seen in North American sled racing, led to the development of the eurohound and greyster, crosses utilizing German shorthair pointers with Alaskan huskies and greyhounds, respectively. While the Mackenzie River husky has been largely replaced by mechanized travel, Alaskan huskies continue to be the most commonly used type of dog for competitive sled dog racing today.

Other historical examples are the bull and terrier (Old English Bulldog and terrier cross) and crosses between foxhounds and Old Spanish Pointers that later resulted in the English Pointer.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; traces what was the &quot;designer dog&quot; fad to the late 20th century when breeders began to cross purebred Poodles with other purebred breeds to obtain a dog with the Poodle&#x27;s hypoallergenic coat, along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds. The resulting puppies are called by a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from the breed names of the two purebred parents, such as Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle cross), or Shepsky (German Shepherd Dog/Siberian Husky cross). Other purebred breeds are being crossed to provide designer dogs described with an endless range of created labels, such as the Puggle (Pug and Beagle cross). There are even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner, such as the German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog, Siberian Husky and Chow Chow cross).

Like children in a family, a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other, even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of purebreds. Often even pups in the same litter will look quite different.

Another defining characteristic of designer dogs is that they are usually bred as companion dogs and pets. Working and hunting dogs deliberately crossbred for a particular working purpose are not generally given portmanteau names; they are most often referred to by a type name, such as eurohounds (racing sled dogs) or lurchers (hunting dogs). These dogs could be considered only as crossbreeds, not as designer animals, since appearance is not the main reason for them to be bred. An exception to this is the Labradoodle, which although having a portmanteau name, is often used as a Guide or Assistance dog as well as being a popular family dog.

Although designer dogs are often selected by owners for their novelty, reputable breeders sometimes use crossbreeding in an attempt to reduce the incidence of certain hereditary problems found in the purebred dogs, while retaining their more appealing traits. Jon Mooallem, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented, &quot;Given the roughly 350 inherited disorders littering the dog genome, crossing two purebreds and expanding their gene pools can be &#x27;a phenomenally good idea,&#x27; according to one canine geneticist—if it is done conscientiously.&quot; Crossbreeding has not been well studied in dogs, although it has been for livestock. The heritability of the desired trait being bred for (such as a hypoallergenic coat) needs to be known; &quot;Heritability is the proportion of the measurable difference observed between animals for a given trait that is due to genetics (and can be passed to the next generation).&quot; In addition, the goals of dog crossbreeding may be harder to define than the goals of livestock crossbreeding; good temperament may be harder to define and measure than high calf weight.

Designer dog breeders are often criticized for being more interested in profitable puppy production than in dog health and welfare. Wally Conron, writing in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, comments on the popularity of crosses after his introduction of the Labradoodle: &quot;Were breeders bothering to check their sires and bitches for heredity faults, or were they simply caught up in delivering to hungry customers the next status symbol?&quot; 

&#x27;Designer dog&#x27; puppies sometimes bring higher prices than the purebreds from which they are bred. Fanciers of designer dogs say that all modern dog breeds were created from earlier breeds and types of dogs through the same kind of selective breeding that is used to create designer dogs. Most of the modern breeds have ancestries that include various older dog types and breeds; see individual breed articles for details of the origin of each breed.

==Health and genetic defects==
Crossbreeding that takes advantage of the increased chance that a recessive detrimental allele will only be inherited from one parent and therefore not expressed in the phenotype of the offspring, is one strategy breeders can use to decrease the incidences of genetic defects. Knowing the disease incidence in the breed, and the genetic history of the individual, is important.

Some crossbred dogs, created by breeding two purebred dogs of different breeds, may have the advantage of heterosis, or crossbreed vigor. This advantage can be progressively diluted when two crossbreeds are bred in the attempt to create a breed, narrowing the gene pool. The best way to continue taking advantage of crossbreed vigor is from the breeding of dogs of purebred ancestry, as this vigor is typically seen only in the first generation cross of two purebred animals of separate breeds, thus taking advantage of genetic diversity.

Health of crossbred dogs depends on their being descended from healthy parents. Breeders who select their breeding stock for cost-effectiveness and who skip health testing for the same reason will not produce puppies that are as reliably healthy as those bred by more conscientious breeders. However, studies of longevity in dogs have found some advantage for crossbreeds compared to purebred dogs. In general it is believed that crossbred dogs &quot;have a far lower chance of exhibiting the disorders that are common with the parental breeds. Their genetic health will be substantially higher.&quot;

Despite commonly believed to be substantially healthier than pedigree dogs data from clinical records of over 1,000 veterinary hospitals in the US shows the difference in life expectancy between mixed breed dogs and pedigree dogs to be minimal. A review of cemetery data in Japan found that the Shiba Inu had a life expectancy greater than crossbreeds; however crossbreeds still had a higher life expectancy than the average pedigree dog in this study. A Swedish study reviewing over 200,000 dogs registered for a veterinary insurance company in 1995 and 1996 found morbidity to be higher in most pedigrees than mongrels; however several pedigree breeds had a lower morbidity these are in order of highest risk to lowest risk: Drever, Norwegian Buhund, Schillerstövare, Jämthund, Gråhund, Siberian Husky, Karelian Bear Dog, Smålandsstövare, Finnish Spitz, and Norbottenspets. Notably all the breeds are native to the Scandinavian peninsula and are most commonly used as working dogs.

Some health issues not common in either parent breed may be more common in the crossbreed than both of the parent breeds. Prolapsed nictitating membrane gland is a condition more common in the Puggle and Jug than both of the parent breeds, which shows the complexity of genetics and provides evidence against the theory of hybrid vigour. Overall designer dog breeds had lower rates of PNMG.

==Registration and recognition==
Crossbreed dogs are not recognized by traditional breed registries, even if both parents are registered purebreds. Breed associations such as the American Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club do not recognize designer crosses as dog breeds.

If crossbred dogs are bred together for some period of time, and their breeding is well documented, they may eventually be considered a new breed of dog by major kennel clubs (an example of a recent crossbreed becoming a breed recognised by all major kennel clubs is the Cesky Terrier). New breeds of dogs must have a breed club that will document the ancestry of any individual member of that breed from the original founding dogs of the breed; when the kennel club that the breed club wishes to join is satisfied that the dogs are pedigreed, they will accept and register the dogs of that breed. Each kennel club has individual rules about how to document a new breed. Some minor registries and internet registry businesses will register dogs as any breed the owner
chooses with minimal or no documentation; some even allow the breeder or owner to make up a designer &quot;breed name&quot; for their pet.

<text>The Bakhtiari (also spelled Bakhtiyari; Persian:بختیاری) are a Lur tribe from Iran. They speak the Bakhtiari dialect of the Luri language.

Bakhtiaris primarily inhabit Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari and eastern Khuzestan, Lorestan, Bushehr, and Isfahan provinces. Bakhtiari tribes have an especially large population concentration in the cities of Masjed Soleyman, Izeh, Shahr-e Kord, and Andika, and the surrounding villages.

A small percentage of Bakhtiari are still nomadic pastoralists, migrating between summer quarters (&quot;sardsīr&quot; or &quot;yaylāq&quot;) and winter quarters (&quot;garmsīr&quot; or &quot;qishlāq&quot;).

== Population ==
Some sources estimate the population of Bakhtiari lors in the whole country to be around 3 to 6 million people.Some other sources have estimated the population of Il Bakhtiari at 4 million people..In the Bakhtiarika book, the population of monolingual Bakhtiari is estimated at 2 million, and the population of bilingual Bakhtiari plus those who have forgotten their mother tongue is estimated at nearly 2 million (total of 4 million people).

==Origins==
Although there have been several suggested theories for the origin of the Bakhtiyaris, historians and researchers generally agree that they are Lurs. According to folklore, the Lurs are descended from a group of youngsters who survived and fled from the demon Zahhak, a demonic figure who is mentioned in Zoroastrian mythology, as well as the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. They took shelter in Zardkuh and Kuhrang, where they named themselves Lur (&quot;nomadic&quot;). Due to their luck of escaping danger throughout their history, they called themselves &quot;bakhtiyar&quot; (&quot;fortunate&quot;). In scholarship, it has been suggested Bakhtiyaris are descended from the Uxian tribe, who clashed with the Macedonian king Alexander the Great () in Khuzestan 330 BC.

A second theory suggests that the Bakhtiyaris were originally from Fars, but were settled to the north of Isfahan and Khuzestan after the legendary king Kay Khosrow conquered Media. A third theory suggests that the Bakhtiyaris were descended from the Mardi, a nomadic warrior tribe that lived around the Caspian coast of northern Iran. Due to the close resemblance to the names Bakhtiyari and Bakhtari (Bactrian), some historians have suggested that the Bakhtiyaris are descended from the Greeks who ruled over Bactria. The resemblance between Bakhtiyari and Greek dance has been used as further proof. Other historians consider the Bakhtiyaris to have resided in their area for a long time, and that they named themselves after the ancient Persian word &quot;Bakhtar&quot; (&quot;the West&quot;) due to their geographical position.

Another theory supported by some historians is that the Bakhtiyaris are descended from Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar (), the Buyid ruler of Iraq. The name of the latter is first attestation of the word Bakhtiyar. The Bakhtiyaris themselves consider their name to be derived from the word Bakhtiyarwand, the name of the offspring of Bakhtiyar, a distinguished figure of Lur-i Buzurg (Greater Lur).

===Genetics===
According to research into NRY markers, the Bakhtiari, as with many other groups in Iran, show very elevated frequencies for Y-DNA haplogroup J2— a trait common for Eurasian populations, likely originating in Anatolia and the Caucasus The Southwest Eurasian haplogroups F, G, and T1a also reach substantial frequency among Bakhtiaris.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;bakhtiari&quot; can be best translated as &quot;companion of fortune&quot; or &quot;bearer of good luck&quot; The term has deep Persian roots, and is the result of two smaller words &quot;bakht&quot; and &quot;yar&quot; complied together. &quot;Bakht&quot; is the Persian word for &quot;fortune&quot; and &quot;yar&quot;, &quot;iar&quot;, &quot;iari&quot; literally means &quot;companion&quot;.

The latter designation largely relates to the nature of the tribe&#x27;s annual &quot;migration&quot;. This has to do with the harsh nature of Bakhtiari life, and overcoming of countless difficulties that Bakhtiaris have faced in the Zagros ranges. In this sense, Bakhtiaris view themselves as a hardworking tribe, facing numerous obstacles every day, and yet fortunate enough to overcome each of these challenges as a solid unit.

Nevertheless, the origins of Bakhtiaris are ancient, and it may have very well been the case that the tribe underwent a series of name changes throughout its history. However it is mostly claimed that the designation &quot;Bakhtiari&quot; came largely into use some time in antiquity.

In &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;, Jacob Bronowski states that &quot;The Bakhtiari take their name from a legendary herdsman of Mongol times, Bakhtyar,&quot; who according to a Bakhtiari origin myth is &quot;the father of [their] people&quot;. Bronowski points out similarities between Bakhtyar and the Israelite Jacob, who was also the ancestral patriarch of his nomadic people and a herdsman who had two wives.

==History==
In , Lorestan was split up into realms; Lur-i Buzurg (Greater Lur) and Lur-i Kuchak (Lesser Lur). The Bakhtiyaris are first attested in history in the early 15th-century. In 1413, the arrival of several Bakhtiyari clans such as the Astarki, Kutwand, Raki, Janaki and Zallaki are mentioned by the Timurid-era historian Mu&#x27;in al-Din Natanzi. Under the Safavids, Lur-i Kuchak became known as Luristan-i Fili, while Lur-i Buzurg (extending from Isfahan to Kohgiluyeh and from Shushtar to Behbahan) became Bakhtiyari land. In 1566, Shah Tahmasp I () selected the Astarki chieftain Tajmir as &quot;ilkhan&quot; of the Bakhtiyari. He was, however, later killed and succeeded by Jahangir Khan Bakhtiyari, who is responsible for splitting the Bakhtiyaris into two groups, the Haft Lang and Chahar Lang. By the time of the reign of Shah Abbas I (), the northern part of Lur-i Buzurg became known as Bakhtiyari.

Constitutional Revolution: In Iran&#x27;s contemporary history, the Bakhtiari have played a significant role; particularly during the advent of the country&#x27;s Constitutional Revolution (1905–1907). This event was largely secured through the Bakhtari campaign, which eventually deposed Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1907–1909). The Bakhtiari tribesmen, under the leadership of the Haft Lang khans Sardar Assad and his brother Najaf Qoli Khan Bakhtiari- Saad ad-Daula (also referred to as Samsam-os Saltane), captured Tehran and, as a result, saved the revolution. These events eventually led to the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1907–1909) in 1909, and his exile to Russia. This incident secured Saad ad-Daula the position of Prime Minister in the period that followed the abdication of the Qajar Shah. Nonetheless, with Russian backing, the Shah would soon return in 1911 by landing with a coalition of forces at Astarabad . However, his efforts to reclaim his throne would bear no fruit. In this sense, the Bakhtiaris played a critical role in saving the revolution from the Qajar forces.

World War I: During the Persian campaign of 1915, the German agent Wilhelm Wassmus traveled to Bushehr under the protection of Bakhtiara Khan. Paradoxically, it was the Bakhtiari tribe that the British entrusted with guarding the Persian oil pipeline at Karun, for which they were paid very handsomely. At the same time, the British hoped to make the tribe a reliable ally.

Pahlavi Period: With the expansion of Bakhtiari influence, urban elites (particularly in Tehran) began to worry in regards to a potential Bakhtiari takeover of Persia&#x27;s affairs. Prior to this point, the Bakhtiari had largely remained within their own territorial boundaries. The Bakhtiari influence would continue to play an important role within the early 20th century politics of Iran. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–1941) made the destruction of the Bakhtiari influence his mission. The existence of oil on Bakhtiari territory further motivated the Pahlavi monarch to undermine the autonomy of the tribe, and force its population to adhere to the commands of the central government. Reza Shah Pahlavi would eventually execute a few noteworthy tribal leaders to crush Bakhtiari autonomy and maintain control over the tribe. Amongst the executed Khans was Mohammad Reza Khan (Sardar-e-Fateh), whose son later became the Pahlavi Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar. The latter event was a turning point for Bakhtiari and their rise within Iranian politics.

== Music ==
The Bakhtiari are noted in Iran for their music which inspired Russian composer Alexander Borodin.

== Culture ==

=== Livelihood and dwellings ===
Bakhtiari nomads migrate twice a year with their herds for pasture: in spring to the mountains in their summer quarters (sardsīr or yaylāq), and in autumn to valleys and the plains in their winter quarters (garmsīr or qishlāq). The livestock the Bakhtiari mainly raise are goats, sheep, horses, and cattle. However, some Bakhtiari also engage in agricultural occupations, and mostly cultivate wheat and other cereal grains. Nomadic Baktiari rely on trading and bartering with nearby villages and populations to obtain products they don&#x27;t have or are unable to create themselves (like agricultural goods). Temporary dwellings for the Bakhtiari include rectangular tents or brush or wood shelters. These types of dwellings are used when moving their herds around. Recently, some Bakhtiari have urbanized and began to settle in large villages and even in cities.

=== Language, gender, and religion ===
Shia Islam is the main religion followed by both the nomadic and sedentary Bakhtiaris. However, according to a Shia cleric in Iran some Bakhtiari Lurs have converted to Zoroastrianism in recent years.

Despite the patriarchal nature of Bakhtiari society, women enjoy a rather high degree of freedom. This was because of their importance in the Bakhtiari economy as weavers, in which colorful and stylish designs on carpets made them very popular among buyers. However, after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Bakhtiari (along with Iranian society in general) underwent rapid changes so presently, Bakhtiari women do not have the same kind of privileges they had before the revolution.

<text>Sherman Joseph Alexie Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Native American novelist, short story writer, poet, screenwriter, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington.

His best-known book is the semi-autobiographical young adult novel, &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian&quot; (2007), which won the 2007 U.S. National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature and the Odyssey Award as best 2008 audiobook for young people (read by Alexie).

He also wrote &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot; (1993), a collection of short stories, which was adapted as the film &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; (1998), for which he also wrote the screenplay. His first novel, &quot;Reservation Blues&quot;, received a 1996 American Book Award.
His 2009 collection of short stories and poems, &quot;War Dances&quot;, won the 2010 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.

==Early life==
Alexie was born at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. He is a citizen of the Spokane Tribe of the Spokane Reservation and grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a citizen of the Coeur D&#x27;Alene Tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Spokane, Colville, Choctaw, and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent.

Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the brain&#x27;s ventricular system. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie&#x27;s surgery was successful; he did not experience mental damage but
had other side effects.

His parents were alcoholics, though his mother achieved sobriety. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie&#x27;s mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, served as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post, and worked other jobs as well.

Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging, as he was constantly teased by other kids and endured abuse he described as &quot;torture&quot; from white nuns who taught there. They called him &quot;The Globe&quot; because his head was larger than usual, due to his hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie had seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them. Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males. Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals.

==Education==
In order to better his education, Alexie decided to leave the reservation and attend high school, where he was the only Native American student, 22 miles from the reservation in Reardan, Washington. He excelled at his studies and became a star player on the basketball team, the Reardan High School Indians. He was elected class president and was a member of the debate team.

His successes in high school won him a scholarship in 1985 to Gonzaga University, a Jesuit university in Spokane. Originally, Alexie enrolled in the Pre-medical program with hopes of becoming a doctor, but found he was squeamish during dissection in his anatomy classes. Alexie switched to law, but found that was not suitable, either. He felt enormous pressure to succeed in college, and consequently, he began drinking heavily to cope with his anxiety. Unhappy with law, Alexie found comfort in literature classes.

In 1987, he dropped out of Gonzaga and enrolled in Washington State University (WSU), where he took a creative writing course taught by Alex Kuo, a respected poet of Chinese-American background. Alexie was at a low point in his life, and Kuo served as a mentor to him. Kuo gave Alexie an anthology entitled &quot;Songs of This Earth on Turtle&#x27;s Back&quot;, by Joseph Bruchac. He was inspired by reading works of poetry written by Native Americans.

==Sexual harassment allegations==
On February 28, 2018, Alexie published a statement regarding accusations of sexual harassment against him by several women, to which he responded &quot;Over the years, I have done things that have harmed other people&quot; and apologized, while also admitting to having had an affair with author Litsa Dremousis, one of the accusers, whose specific charges he repudiated. Dremousis said that &quot;she&#x27;d had an affair with Alexie, but had remained friends with him until the stories about his sexual behavior surfaced&quot;. She claimed that numerous women had spoken to her about Alexie&#x27;s behavior. Dremousis&#x27;s response initially appeared on her Facebook page and was subsequently reprinted in &quot;The Stranger&quot; on March 1, 2018. The allegations against Alexie were detailed in an NPR story five days later.

The fallout from these accusations includes the Institute of American Indian Arts renaming its Sherman Alexie Scholarship as the MFA Alumni Scholarship. The blog &quot;Native Americans in Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; has deleted or modified all references to Alexie. In February 2018 it was reported that the American Library Association, which had just awarded Alexie its Carnegie Medal for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me: A Memoir&quot;, was reconsidering, and in March it was confirmed that Alexie had declined the award and was postponing the publication of a paperback version of the memoir. The American Indian Library Association rescinded its 2008 Best Young Adult Book Award from Alexie for &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian&quot;, &quot;to send an unequivocal message that Alexie&#x27;s actions are unacceptable.&quot;

==Career==
Alexie published his first collection of poetry, &quot;The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems&quot;, in 1992 through Hanging Loose Press. With that success, Alexie stopped drinking and quit school just three credits short of a degree. However, in 1995, he was awarded an honorary bachelor&#x27;s degree from Washington State University.

In 2005, Alexie became a founding board member of Longhouse Media, a non-profit organization that is committed to teaching filmmaking skills to Native American youth and using media for cultural expression and social change. Alexie has long supported youth programs and initiatives dedicated to supporting at-risk Native youth.

===Literary works===

Alexie&#x27;s stories have been included in several short story anthologies, including &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; 2004, edited by Lorrie Moore; and &quot;Pushcart Prize&quot; XXIX of the Small Presses. Additionally, a number of his pieces have been published in various literary magazines and journals, as well as online publications.

===Themes===
Alexie&#x27;s poetry, short stories, and novels explore themes of despair, poverty, violence, and alcoholism in the lives of Native American people, both on and off the reservation. They are lightened by wit and humor. According to Sarah A. Quirk from the &quot;Dictionary of Library Biography,&quot; Alexie asks three questions across all of his works: &quot;What does it mean to live as an Indian in this time? What does it mean to be an Indian man? Finally, what does it mean to live on an Indian reservation?&quot; The protagonists in most of his literary works exhibit a constant struggle with themselves and their own sense of powerlessness in white American society.

===Poetry===
Within a year of graduating from college, Alexie received the Washington State Arts Commission Poetry Fellowship and the National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Fellowship. His career began with the publishing of his first two collections of poetry in 1992, entitled, &quot;I Would Steal Horses&quot; and &quot;The Business of Fancydancing.&quot; In these poems, Alexie uses humor to express the struggles of contemporary Indians on reservations. Common themes include alcoholism, poverty, and racism. Although he uses humor to express his feelings, the underlying message is very serious. Alexie was awarded The Chad Walsh Poetry Prize by the Beloit Poetry Journal in 1995.

&quot;The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems (1992)&quot; was well received, selling over 10,000 copies. Alexie refers to his writing as &quot;fancydancing,&quot; a flashy, colorful style of competitive powwow dancing. Whereas older forms of Indian dance may be ceremonial and kept private among tribal members, the fancy dance style was created for public entertainment. Alexie compares the mental, emotional, and spiritual outlet that he finds in his writings to the vivid self-expression of the dancers. Leslie Ullman commented on &quot;The Business of Fancydancing&quot; in the &quot;Kenyon Review,&quot; writing that Alexie &quot;weaves a curiously soft-blended tapestry of humor, humility, pride and metaphysical provocation out of the hard realities...: the tin-shack lives, the alcohol dreams, the bad luck and burlesque disasters, and the self-destructive courage of his characters.&quot;

Alexie&#x27;s other collections of poetry include:
* &quot;The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Old Shirts and New Skins&quot; (1993)
* &quot;First Indian on the Moon&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Seven Mourning Songs For the Cedar Flute I Have Yet to Learn to Play&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Water Flowing Home&quot; (1996)
* &quot;The Summer of Black Widows&quot; (1996)
* &quot;The Man Who Loves Salmon&quot; (1998)
* &quot;One Stick Song&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Face&quot; (2009), Hanging Loose Press (April 15, 2009) hardcover, 160 pages, 

===Short stories===
Alexie published his first prose work, entitled &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven,&quot; in 1993. The book consists of a series of short stories that are interconnected. Several prominent characters are explored, and they have been featured in later works by Alexie. According to Sarah A. Quirk, &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot; can be considered a bildungsroman with dual protagonists, &quot;Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire, moving from relative innocence to a mature level on experience.&quot;

&quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (2004) is a collection of &quot;nine extraordinary short stories set in and around the Seattle area, featuring Spokane Indians from all walks of urban life,&quot; according to Christine C. Menefee of the &quot;School Library Journal&quot;. In this collection, Alexie &quot;challenges stereotypes that whites have of Native Americans and at the same time shows the Native American characters coming to terms with their own identities.&quot;

&quot;War Dances&quot; is a collection of short stories, poems, and short works. It won the 2010 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. The collection, however, received mixed reviews.

Other short stories by Alexie include:
* &quot;Superman and Me&quot; (1997)
* &quot;The Toughest Indian in the World&quot; (2000) (collection of short stories)
* &quot;What You Pawn I Will Redeem&quot; (2003), published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;
* &quot;Blasphemy: New and Selected Stories&quot; (2012)
* &quot;Because My Father Always Said He Was the Only Indian Who Saw Jimi Hendrix Play &#x27;The Star−Spangled Banner&#x27; at Woodstock&quot;

===Novels===
In his first novel, &quot;Reservation Blues&quot; (1995), Alexie revisits some of the characters from &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.&quot; Thomas Builds-the-Fire, Victor Joseph, and Junior Polatkin, who have grown up together on the Spokane Indian reservation, were teenagers in the short story collection. In &quot;Reservation Blues&quot; they are now adult men in their thirties. Some of them are now musicians and in a band together. Verlyn Klinkenborg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in a 1995 review of &quot;Reservation Blues&quot;: &quot;you can feel Alexie&#x27;s purposely divided attention, his alertness to a divided audience, Native American and Anglo.&quot; Klinkenborg says that Alexie is &quot;willing to risk didacticism whenever he stops to explain the particulars of the Spokane and, more broadly, the Native American experience to his readers.&quot;

&quot;Indian Killer&quot; (1996) is a murder mystery set among Native American adults in contemporary Seattle, where the characters struggle with urban life, mental health, and the knowledge that there is a serial killer on the loose. Characters deal with the racism in the university system, as well as in the community at large, where Indians are subjected to being lectured about their own culture by white professors who are actually ignorant of Indian cultures.

Alexie&#x27;s young adult novel, &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian&quot; (2007) is a coming-of-age story that began as a memoir of his life and family on the Spokane Indian reservation. The novel focuses on a fourteen-year-old Indian named Arnold Spirit. The novel is semi-autobiographical, including many events and elements of Alexie&#x27;s life. For example, Arnold was born with hydrocephalus, and was teased a lot as a child. The story also portrays events after Arnold&#x27;s transfer to Reardan High School, which Alexie attended. The novel received great reviews and continues to be a top seller. Bruce Barcott from the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; observed, &quot;Working in the voice of a 14-year-old forces Alexie to strip everything down to action and emotion, so that reading becomes more like listening to your smart, funny best friend recount his day while waiting after school for a ride home.&quot;

&quot;Flight&quot; (2007) also features an adolescent protagonist. The narrator, who calls himself &quot;Zits,&quot; is a fifteen-year-old orphan of mixed Native and European ancestry who has bounced around the foster system in Seattle. The novel explores experiences of the past, as Zits experiences short windows into others&#x27; lives after he believes himself to be shot while committing a crime.

=== Memoir ===
Alexie&#x27;s memoir, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me,&quot; was released by Hachette in June 2017. Claudia Rowe of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote in June 2017 that the memoir &quot;pulls readers so deeply into the author&#x27;s youth on the Spokane Indian Reservation that most will forget all about facile comparisons and simply surrender to Alexie&#x27;s unmistakable patois of humor and profanity, history and pathos.&quot; Alexie cancelled his book tour in support of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot; in July 2017 due to the emotional toll that promoting the book was taking. In September 2017, he decided to resume the tour, with some significant changes. As he related to Laurie Hertzel of &quot;The Star Tribune&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m not performing the book,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m getting interviewed. That&#x27;s a whole different thing.&quot; He went on to add that he won&#x27;t be answering any questions that he doesn&#x27;t want to answer. &quot;I&#x27;ll put my armor back on,&quot; he said.

===Films===
In 1998 Alexie&#x27;s film &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; gained considerable attention. Alexie based the screenplay on his short story collection, &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot;, and characters and events from a number of Alexie&#x27;s works make appearances in the film. The film was directed by Chris Eyre, (Cheyenne-Arapaho) with a predominantly Native American production team and cast. The film is a road movie and buddy film, featuring two young Indians, Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds the Fire (Evan Adams), who leave the reservation on a road trip to retrieve the body of Victor&#x27;s dead father (Gary Farmer). During their journey the characters&#x27; childhood is explored via flashbacks. The film took top honors at the Sundance Film Festival. It received an 86% and &quot;fresh&quot; rating from the online film database Rotten Tomatoes.

&quot;The Business of Fancydancing&quot;, written and directed by Alexie in 2002, explores themes of Indian identity, gay identity, cultural involvement vs blood quantum, living on the reservation or off it, and other issues related to what makes someone a &quot;real Indian.&quot; The title refers to the protagonist&#x27;s choice to leave the reservation and make his living performing for predominantly-white audiences. Evan Adams, who plays Thomas Builds the Fire in &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;, again stars, now as an urban gay man with a white partner. The death of a peer brings the protagonist home to the reservation, where he reunites with his friends from his childhood and youth. The film is unique in that Alexie hired an almost completely female crew to produce the film. Many of the actors improvised their dialogue, based on real events in their lives. It received a 57 percent and &quot;rotten&quot; rating from the online film database Rotten Tomatoes.

==Personal life==
Alexie is married to Diane Tomhave, a citizen of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, is of Hidatsa, Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi heritage. They live in Seattle with their two sons.

==Arizona HB 2281==
In 2012, Arizona&#x27;s HB 2281 removed Alexie&#x27;s works, along with those of others, from Arizona school curriculum. Alexie&#x27;s response:

==Style==
Alexie&#x27;s influences for his literary works do not rely solely on traditional Indian forms. He &quot;blends elements of popular culture, Indian spirituality, and the drudgery of poverty-ridden reservation life to create his characters and the world they inhabit,&quot; according to Quirk. Alexie&#x27;s work often includes humor as well. According to Quirk, he does this as a &quot;means of cultural survival for American Indians—survival in the face of the larger American culture&#x27;s stereotypes of American Indians and their concomitant distillation of individual tribal characteristics into one pan-Indian consciousness.&quot;

<text>Jeffrey Outlaw Shallit (born October 17, 1957) is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He is an active number theorist and a noted critic of intelligent design. He is married to Anna Lubiw, also a computer scientist.

== Early life and education ==
Shallit was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1957. His father was journalist Joseph Shallit, the son of Jewish immigrants from Vitebsk, Russia (now in Belarus). His mother was Louise Lee Outlaw Shallit, a writer. He has one brother, Jonathan Shallit, a music professor.

Shallit earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in mathematics from Princeton University in June 1979. He received a Ph.D., also in mathematics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in June 1983. His doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Metric Theory of Pierce Expansions&quot; and his advisor was Manuel Blum.

== Advocacy ==
Since 1996, Shallit has held the position of Vice-President of Electronic Frontier Canada.

In 1997, he gained attention for the publication on the Internet of &quot;Holocaust Revised: Lies of Our Times&quot; (also called the &quot;Shallit Report&quot;), a reprint of an article he had written for a Waterloo student publication in 1993, which detailed the backgrounds and past statements of various persons whom he accused of being Holocaust deniers, notably David Irving, Fred A. Leuchter, and Eustace Mullins. This triggered a public exchange of letters between him and Irving.

Shallit has been a critic of the work of William Dembski promoting intelligent design. He has coauthored a paper with Wesley Elsberry demonstrating problems with Dembski&#x27;s mathematical work, and would have appeared as a witness opposing Dembski in the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial had Dembski not dropped out.

== Professional life ==
 Shallit is a Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Journal of Integer Sequences&quot;. His primary academic interests are combinatorics on words, formal languages, automata theory, and algorithmic number theory. He has been recognized by the Association for Computing Machinery as a Distinguished Scientist (2008).

His publications include the books &quot;Algorithmic Number Theory&quot; (with Eric Bach), a noted text on algorithms, &quot;Automatic Sequences: Theory, Applications, Generalizations&quot; (with ), and &quot;A Second Course in Formal Languages and Automata Theory&quot;.

<doc id="825210" wikidata="Q3496959" url="?curid=825210" title="Star Fox 2">
<text>Star Fox 2 is a rail shooter game developed by Nintendo and Argonaut Software and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was completed in 1995 but did not see an official release until 2017 on the Super NES Classic Edition.

Like the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993), &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; pushed the graphical capabilities of the SNES with Argonaut&#x27;s Super FX chip. Dylan Cuthbert was the lead programmer, with Shigeru Miyamoto returning as the producer and Katsuya Eguchi as the director. &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; introduces semi-real-time gameplay, new ship types, new playable characters, and a more advanced 3D game engine. The story continues the battle against Emperor Andross, who seeks to destroy the Lylat system. 

By 1995, 3D technology was advancing quickly and the 3D game market was expanding, with competition from the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. Concerned that the 16-bit graphics of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; would compare poorly against newer games, Nintendo canceled the &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; release to prioritize its upcoming Nintendo 64 console. The Nintendo 64 game &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; (1997) incorporated some concepts introduced in &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;.

In the years after the cancellation, various prototype ROM images were leaked online. In 2017, &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was officially released for the first time as one of 21 games included in the Super NES Classic Edition. In 2019, it became available for the Nintendo Switch to subscribers of the Nintendo Switch Online service. &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at its depth, design and the strategy elements in its gameplay, but was criticized for its controls, short length and technical performance.

==Gameplay==

Instead of following mostly linear paths inside predefined missions as in &quot;Star Fox&quot;, the player moves a team of two ships freely around a map screen that represents the Lylat system. When the player&#x27;s ships make contact with enemy forces, the game switches to an action perspective, piloting the Arwing ship directly with controls and gameplay similar to the first &quot;Star Fox&quot;. When the player clears the specified objectives, they are taken back to the map screen to select a new destination. The two chosen pilots have their own shield gauges and can be swapped at any moment in the map, but one of them runs out of energy, their Arwing will explode, resulting in their death. When a pilot dies, it&#x27;s possible to continue with remaining one, though the other cannot be used for the rest of the game.

The objective is to beat all enemy forces present in the map while defending planet Corneria, preventing its damage level from reaching 100%. The player must intercept fighters and incoming IPBMs (interplanetary ballistic missiles), while also dealing with battleships, which deploy more fighter squadrons, and planetary bases, which fire IPBMs. If Corneria&#x27;s damage level reaches 100% or both pilots die, the game is over. General Pepper employs a satellite that can shoot down enemies on a limited basis; the player must also defend this installation from special enemies that can take over the satellite and use its cannon to fire at Corneria. The player also encounters the Star Wolf mercenary team and various bosses.

&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; employs a semi-real-time strategy system. While selecting a destination on the map screen, the game is paused, but while the player&#x27;s ships travel to their destinations, enemies and missiles also move toward theirs. While fighting enemies in the action screen, time moves at a slower pace than on the map screen, allowing other enemies and missiles to advance and cause damage. To prevent excessive damage to Corneria, the player may need to leave a battle to intercept another enemy.

==Plot==
After his defeat in the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;, the antagonist, Andross, returns to the Lylat system and launches an all-out attack against Corneria, using his new fleet of battleships and giant missiles launched from hidden bases to destroy the planet. General Pepper again calls upon the Star Fox team for help. Armed with new custom Arwings, a Mothership, and two new recruits (Miyu and Fay), the Star Fox team sets out to defend Corneria by destroying Andross&#x27;s forces before they can inflict critical damage on the planet. Along the way, Star Fox must also combat giant bosses, bases on planets throughout the Lylat system, members of the Star Wolf team and finally Andross himself.

&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; features six playable characters, more than any game in the series until &quot;Star Fox Command&quot; (2006). These include Fox McCloud, fearless leader of the Star Fox team, Falco Lombardi, the ace pilot with a headstrong attitude and is Fox&#x27;s best friend, Peppy Hare, longtime mentor to Fox, and Slippy Toad, the team&#x27;s young tech analyst and Fox&#x27;s childhood friend. The two new playable characters are Miyu, a tomboyish lynx, and Fay, a white dog and part of an aristocratic family. &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; also introduces a team of rival mercenary pilots, Star Wolf, which includes Wolf O&#x27;Donnell, leader of Star Wolf and a despicable criminal, Leon Powalski, an inscrutable and sinister chameleon, Pigma Dengar, an arrogant and selfish pig who is a former member of the Star Fox team before betraying them, and Algy, a devious creature with incredible precision aim.

==Development==

Like its predecessor &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993), &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was co-developed by Nintendo EAD in Japan and the British company Argonaut Software. Development began shortly after work was finished on the European and competition versions of &quot;Star Fox&quot;. Argonaut had a contract with Nintendo to create three games; after &quot;Star Fox&quot;, Argonaut programmers Giles Goddard and Dylan Cuthbert worked on &quot;Stunt Race FX&quot; (1994) and Cuthbert on &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;. Cuthbert worked in Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters in Kyoto and had little contact with Argonaut during development. He served as the lead programmer and was assigned two Japanese Nintendo programmers to work under him. The team was overseen by the designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi, with Eguchi as the director. &quot;Edge&quot; reported in December 1993 that development on a sequel to &quot;Star Fox&quot; had begun.

The team decided early on to use the Super FX 2 chip in the game cartridge. It was an enhanced version of the Super FX, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) for SNES ROM cartridges developed by Argonaut. The original chip was designed to calculate 3D math quickly and was first used in &quot;Star Fox&quot;. The Super FX 2 had more memory and ran at 21 MHz, twice as fast as the original chip. Argonaut&#x27;s original proposal for the Super FX used this improved architecture, but Nintendo found it too expensive. Cuthbert also rewrote parts of the engine to run in parallel in RAM to free more Super FX 2 processing for more advanced features, such as planar clipping and advanced collision detection. These enhancements enabled the chip to manipulate more polygons and sprites and to map textures more quickly, giving the team the computing power needed for free-roaming 3D environments. Such free-roaming gameplay was planned for the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;, but it was made on-rails because of the original Super FX chip&#x27;s limited computing powers. Cuthbert also retooled the engine to increase the frame rate from 20 to 30 frames per second, but it was not steady so they locked the frame rate at 20 FPS. Freely explorable environments were the only gameplay element planned for the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; carried into &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;; all other ideas were new.
Miyamoto considered the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series a platform for experimenting with new gameplay ideas. The team experimented more with &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; than &quot;Star Fox&quot;. This led to gameplay ideas such as the platforming sequences with the robot walker. Miyamoto took great interest in Cuthbert&#x27;s platforming gameplay (before &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;&#x27;s release in 1996). At one point in development, the Walker sequences occurred in much larger space stations with energy gates that needed to be unlocked, a gameplay structure comparable to dungeon crawling. Because of the Super FX 2&#x27;s greater computing power, the team decided to have the fighters visibly transform into bipedal Walkers. The transformation was made in a realistic sense; the artists drafted the mechanisms by which the fighters transformed.

Eguchi wanted to explore a more roguelike game system and use similar game mechanics to &quot;Star Luster&quot; (1985). He played &quot;Star Luster&quot; repeatedly for inspiration and was particularly fond of its random encounters system. He also enjoyed &quot;Fortune Street&quot; and was inspired by its more strategic gameplay elements. Given this direction, the team designed the main gameplay structure: players would move across a map defending planets from the enemy, battling in randomly generated enemy encounters. It was designed to play out differently each gameplay session. For further replayability, the team added six playable characters, two of which were series newcomers: Miyu and Fay. More antagonists were added, including Wolf. A two-player mode was planned and tested, but the team could not get the frame rate high and steady enough for it to be enjoyable.

=== Promotion at Winter CES ===
&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was playable on the show floor at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (Winter CES) in Las Vegas in January 1995. The version demonstrated was significantly different from the final version. &quot;GamePro&quot; enjoyed the free-roaming gameplay, the craft morphing ability, and strategy elements. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; also liked the shift to free-roaming and felt the non-linear gameplay and ship morphing abilities were major improvements. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; dubbed it their top SNES game of the show. All three magazines thought &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was better than the original. &quot;Edge&quot; was more critical, writing that &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was Nintendo&#x27;s attempt to keep the SNES relevant. They wrote that the Super FX polygons were not particularly impressive, and the gameplay lacked &quot;the immediate appeal of its predecessor&quot;. A man was arrested and charged with felony grand larceny for attempting to steal a demo cart from the show floor.

===Cancellation===

By mid-1995, &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was nearing completion, and was planned for release in August. However, 3D technology was advancing quickly and the 3D game market was expanding, with competition from the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The consoles ran impressive 3D graphics that captured the public&#x27;s attention. Nintendo was concerned that the 16-bit &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; 3D visuals would be compared to the superior 3D capabilities of competing consoles. Cuthbert said that &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; would be &quot;compared directly against games such as &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, which felt like you finally had an arcade machine&#x27;s power in your home&quot;.

Nintendo decided to prioritize its upcoming Nintendo 64 console, including a new &quot;Star Fox&quot; game, &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;. According to Cuthbert, Miyamoto wanted a clear break between 3D games on the SNES and Nintendo 64. The Super FX 2 chip also raised the cost of production, which would have made &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; an expensive release.

&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was canceled in mid-1995, when it was about 95% complete. Nintendo still wanted the game finished after cancellation, so they took it through full localization and QA testing. Cuthbert said there may have been no official announcement of cancellation, and there was confusion about the game&#x27;s status in the media. The August issue of &quot;GamePro&quot; printed that it had been delayed to 1996, while &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote that it had been canceled in their September issue. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; wrote in their September issue that &quot;rumors of the demise of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; have been greatly exaggerated&quot;, and that the release was most likely coming in the first half of 1996.

==Release==
For many years, the completed version of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; remained in Nintendo&#x27;s archives. Super FX games were not considered for Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console content distribution service because Nintendo had difficulty emulating the chip. In 2015, Miyamoto told journalists: &quot;In my memory, I enjoyed [&quot;Star Fox 2&quot;] but I&#x27;m not sure I would release it, [...] I&#x27;d rather have people play a new game&quot;.

===Beta leaks===

In the years following cancellation, ROM images of incomplete builds of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; were leaked anonymously onto the internet. Cuthbert denied he had leaked it and suspected the ROMs had been taken from his hard drive after he left Argonaut.

The first ROMs leaked in the late 1990s were early test builds with numerous software bugs. These versions mostly consist of debug menus and sparsely populated landscapes; one version includes a two-player mode. A few years later, an anonymous person reached out to the emulation community, saying that they had a non-working copy of the final beta ROM. The community determined that an internal header was missing and were able to add the header to get it functioning. The ROM image was leaked online after. This version was in Japanese and much more complete than previous versions. The emulation community was inspired by the release to improve Super FX chip handling in their Super NES emulators. A fan translation patch was also released which took four people and over 100 hours of work. The patch developers also changed a debug modifier that was set to zero, preventing Corneria from taking damage.

All leaked ROMs are beta versions. Some gameplay features do not work correctly, are incomplete, or hampered by bugs. According to Cuthbert, all the leaked ROMs lack the final few months of QA work. They were also all set up in debug mode, so the encounter systems and randomized gameplay elements do not work correctly. Speaking about the final beta ROM, he said: &quot;The basic parts are there, but there is an adage in game development, &#x27;The last 10 percent is 90 percent of the game&#x27; and the ROM is missing that last 10 percent of iteration and refinement&quot;.

===Official release===

When compiling a list of games to include on the Super NES Classic dedicated console, the system&#x27;s producer proposed the inclusion of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;. He thought it would be a waste otherwise to never release a completed and debugged game. Nintendo had preserved the game since its completion, making it easy to bring it to the Super NES Classic. The device was announced along with &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;&#x27;s inclusion in June 2017. The announcement came as a delightful surprise to Cuthbert. No one from Argonaut or Q-Games was consulted or otherwise made aware ahead of the reveal. Some of the original developers celebrated the announcement.

The Super NES Classic was released on September 29, 2017, in North America and Europe and on October 5 in Japan. The version is the localized English ROM that was completed in the 1990s, though Cuthbert suspected Nintendo had to make minor changes, such as altering screen flashing, to get it past modern regulations. Promotional artwork for &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was created by Takaya Imamura, the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; character designer. The instruction manual was released digitally online and included concept art and design documents, an unusual move for Nintendo.

In December 2019, Nintendo released a video of upcoming games for its Nintendo Switch Online NES and Super NES services. The update includes &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; as a part of its portfolio of games, playable by those with an active Nintendo Switch Online membership as of December 12, 2019.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; received generally favorable reception from critics during its inclusion on the Super NES Classic Edition in 2017. &quot;Polygon&quot;″s Ross Miller found it to be ambitious and fun. &quot;Destructoid&quot;″s Chris Carter complimented the constant swap between viewpoints and playstyles, minimal &quot;RPG-like&quot; exposition between levels and the introduction of Star Wolf, stating that they added character into the game but noted its short length and criticized the low framerate. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Christian Donlan described it as an unusual but &quot;wonderfully surprising and inventive&quot; sequel that builds upon the first &quot;Star Fox&quot;, due to its more roguelite nature. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;″ David Houghton gave positive remarks regarding the evolution of the franchise&#x27;s core ideas and free-roaming 3D planets, but criticized its uncohesive game mechanics, overly ambitious ideas and &quot;choppy&quot; technical performance. 

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Samuel Claiborn complimented its &quot;janky-yet-plucky aesthetic&quot; but complained of severe frame-rate drops and found it difficult to control the ships. He felt it was the worst game included with the Super NES Classic Edition, and that it &quot;probably deserved&quot; to have been cancelled, but was happy to see it released. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Damien McFerran praised the depth, complexity and challenge, and called it a good reason to own a Super NES Classic Edition. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot;″s Neal Ronaghan and John Rairdin praised the distinct structure and design, challenge, strategy and roguelike elements, audiovisual presentation, replayability and depth. Rairdin wrote that it was the most important game in the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series, and one of the greatest Super Nintendo games. However, both criticized the lack of rail shooter levels, the slowdown and clipping, and its technical limitations. 

&quot;HobbyConsolas&quot;″ David Martínez commended the Arwing&#x27;s transformation mechanic, open levels and introduction of new Star Fox members and Star Wolf but criticized the game&#x27;s short length, technical shortcomings and controls, feeling that it was not well-rounded as the first entry. &quot;Digital Trends&quot;″ Mike Epstein felt that &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; took some of the biggest risks the &quot;Star Fox&quot; franchise had attempted. &quot;The Verge&quot;″s Andrew Webster called it &quot;a fascinating experience&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Michael Higham gave positive remarks to the land vehicle sequences, freedom of approach to manage an incoming threat and off-rails 3D dogfights in space, but criticized its poor technical performance, short length, and lacking sense of adventure when compared to the first &quot;Star Fox&quot;, among other aspects.

==Legacy==
After &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was canceled, Argonaut&#x27;s contract with Nintendo ended. Cuthbert left Japan and moved to the United States to work with Sony. In 2001, he returned to Japan to establish Q-Games. The company collaborated with Nintendo in 2006 to develop &quot;Star Fox Command&quot;, and again in 2011 for &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot;. Cuthbert found the experimentation with &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; personally helpful in his career.

&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; inspired the design of later &quot;Star Fox&quot; games. Free-range flying and grounded vehicle gameplay were implemented into &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, as was the Star Wolf team. Nintendo and Q-Games played &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; to gather inspiration on its strategic gameplay elements for &quot;Star Fox Command&quot;. Miyamoto asked Cuthbert to make &quot;Command&quot; more similar to &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; than the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;. The Arwing&#x27;s ability to transform into the Walker was re-introduced in &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot; (2016). The game also drove ideas for future Nintendo 64 games. Cuthbert believes a lot of the platforming experimentation they ran in &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; gave Miyamoto confidence for &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

<doc id="825213" wikidata="Q1335527" url="?curid=825213" title="Shigeru Ishiba">
<text>Shigeru Ishiba (; born 4 February 1957) is a Japanese politician serving as Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 2024. He has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1986 and has served as Minister of Defense from 2007 to 2008 and Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 2008 to 2009, as well as being the Secretary-General of the LDP from 2012 to 2014.

Ishiba was born into a political family, with his father, Jirō Ishiba, serving as governor of Tottori Prefecture from 1958 to 1974 before later becoming the Minister for Home Affairs. After graduating from Keio University, Ishiba worked at a bank before entering politics after his father&#x27;s death. Ishiba was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1986 general election as a member of the LDP at the age of 29. As a Diet member, Ishiba specialized in agricultural policy and defense policy. He served as parliamentary vice minister of agriculture under the premiership of Kiichi Miyazawa but left the LDP in 1993 to join the Japan Renewal Party. After transitioning through several parties and returning to the LDP in 1997, Ishiba held various prominent positions, including Director-General of the Defense Agency under the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi, Minister of Defense under the premiership of Yasuo Fukuda and Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries under the premiership of Tarō Asō.

Ishiba became a key figure within the LDP, running for party leadership multiple times. First in 2008 where he placed fifth, and notably against Shinzo Abe in the 2012 and 2018 elections. Despite his criticisms of LDP factionalism, he established his own faction, Suigetsukai, in 2015, aiming for leadership. After Abe&#x27;s second resignation, Ishiba ran in 2020 but placed third behind Yoshihide Suga. Ishiba declined to run and endorsed Taro Kono in the 2021 election which was won by Fumio Kishida. After Kishida announced that he would step down in 2024, Ishiba ran for the fifth and final time in the LDP presidential election where he defeated Sanae Takaichi in a second round run-off, becoming the new party leader and prime minister–designate, and was formally elected Prime Minister by the National Diet on 1 October 2024. As prime minister, Ishiba almost immediately announced a snap general election, where the ruling LDP coalition lost its majority for the first time since 2009 and suffered its second-worst result in party history.

Ishiba has developed a reputation as a political maverick due to his willingness to criticize his own party, as well as his relatively liberal stances on social issues; he supported a motion of no-confidence against the Miyazawa Cabinet in 1993 and criticized Abe throughout his second premiership, despite serving in the governments of both prime ministers.

== Early life ==
Ishiba was born on 4 February 1957, in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, while his registered domicile was his father&#x27;s hometown in the Yazu District of Tottori Prefecture. His father Jirō Ishiba was a government official then serving as Vice Minister of Construction. His mother was a teacher and a granddaughter of the Christian minister Michitomo Kanamori. Jirō Ishiba was elected Governor of Tottori Prefecture in 1958, so the family moved to Tottori; Ishiba has no memory of living in Tokyo. Jirō Ishiba would serve as governor until 1974, and was later elected to the House of Councillors and served as Minister for Home Affairs in the Zenkō Suzuki Cabinet.

Shigeru Ishiba grew up and attended school in Tottori Prefecture. After graduating from Tottori University Junior High School, he moved away to attend Keio Senior High School, going on to study law at Keio University in Tokyo. After graduating in 1979, he began working at the Mitsui Bank. His father died in 1981. Former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was a friend of his father, served as chairman of the funeral committee. Tanaka encouraged Ishiba to become a politician to carry on his father&#x27;s legacy.

== Early political career (1986–2024) ==

Ishiba left the bank in 1983 and began working in the secretariat of the Thursday Club, Kakuei Tanaka&#x27;s faction of the Liberal Democratic Party. In the July 1986 election Ishiba ran as an LDP candidate in the Tottori at-large district and was elected to the House of Representatives. At the age of 29, he was the youngest member of the House at the time.

As a junior Diet member, Ishiba specialised in agricultural policy, but the Gulf War in 1990 and a 1992 visit to North Korea spurred his interest in defense policy. He served as parliamentary vice minister of agriculture under the Miyazawa Cabinet, before defecting from the LDP in 1993, for the Japan Renewal Party. When the Japan Renewal Party merged with several other parties Ishiba became part of the New Frontier Party, but he was disillusioned by the constant struggles between Ozawa and non-Ozawa factions in the party and left in 1996. He rejoined the LDP the following year.

Ishiba was reappointed parliamentary vice minister of Agriculture under the Mori Cabinet in July 2000 but was switched to the position of deputy director general of the Defense Agency in December. He was replaced when the Koizumi Cabinet was appointed. When Koizumi reshuffled the cabinet in September 2002, Ishiba became Director General of the Defense Agency, entering the cabinet for the first time. Ishiba served as director general during the 2003 invasion of Iraq by an American-led coalition. He defended the legality of the invasion and paved the way for the first overseas deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces without UN mandate, sending troops to Iraq in January 2004 to assist with reconstruction efforts. He left cabinet in September 2004.

Ishiba was appointed as the Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on 26 September 2007, serving in that post until 1 August 2008. Ishiba was the second person in the cabinet of Fukuda to express belief in the existence of UFOs after Nobutaka Machimura. Asked on a response to a hypothetical appearance of a UFO, Ishiba said that it would be &quot;difficult&quot; to determine if such an incident amounted to an airspace violation, saying that a UFO was technically not an aircraft from a foreign country. In the same interview, he jokingly said that he would mobilize the Japan Self-Defense Forces in response to an appearance by Godzilla.

Following Fukuda&#x27;s resignation, Ishiba stood as a candidate for the LDP presidency. In the leadership election, held on 22 September 2008, Tarō Asō won with 351 of the 527 votes; Ishiba placed fifth and last with 25 votes. In Asō Cabinet, appointed on 24 September 2008, Ishiba was named as Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. He called for Asō to resign after the LDP&#x27;s defeat in the 2009 Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election. Ishiba retained his seat in the 2009 House of Representatives election, otherwise a crushing defeat for the LDP. After Sadakazu Tanigaki was elected to replace Asō as party president, Ishiba was appointed chairman of the Policy Research Council, one of the top positions in the party. Ishiba was thus one of the most prominent LDP figures when the party was in opposition. He was removed when Tanigaki reshuffled the party leadership in September 2011.

In September 2012, while the LDP was still in opposition, Ishiba again stood for the presidency of the LDP and was narrowly defeated by former prime minister Shinzo Abe. He accepted the position of secretary-general on 27 September 2012. Ishiba was re-appointed to the position under Abe&#x27;s second premiership after the December 2012 general election in which the LDP returned to government. Ishiba attracted considerable criticism for his statement in November 2013 that likened peaceful public protests against the new secrecy bill being introduced by his government to &quot;acts of terrorism&quot;. He later withdrew the comment.

In the September 2014 cabinet reshuffle, Abe moved Ishiba from his position as LDP Secretary-General and appointed him to a newly created office of Minister for Overcoming Population Decline and Vitalizing Local Economy. He was reported to have declined the offer of a cabinet post responsible for the government&#x27;s upcoming security legislation. In spite of having been a vocal critic of factionalism in the LDP, Ishiba launched his own faction, the Suigetsukai, on 28 September 2015, with the aim of succeeding sitting prime minister, Shinzo Abe. With 19 members, excluding Ishiba, it was one member short of the 20 votes required for nomination for LDP leadership.

Ishiba left cabinet in the April 2016 reshuffle, having declined the ministry of Agriculture. Ishiba challenged Abe in the 2018 LDP presidential election but was defeated again. In 2020, following Shinzo Abe&#x27;s second resignation, Ishiba ran for the leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party, losing to Yoshihide Suga, placing third overall. Ishiba declined to run in the 2021 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election, instead endorsing Taro Kono.

== Premiership (2024–present) ==
Then-LDP leader and prime minister Fumio Kishida announced on 14 August 2024, that he would not seek re-election as LDP leader in the leadership election in September, effectively resigning as prime minister, following record-low approval ratings from an ongoing slush fund scandal and previous controversies with the LDP&#x27;s affiliation with the Unification Church. Ishiba, alongside Sanae Takaichi and Shinjirō Koizumi emerged as the front runners to succeed him. In the leadership election on 27 September 2024, Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in a second-round runoff, winning a total of 215 votes (52.57%) from 189 parliamentary members and 26 prefectural chapters, making him the new LDP leader and prime minister–designate; the election was dubbed &quot;Ishibamania&quot; by the foreign media. Ishiba&#x27;s victory was described by commentators as unexpected and an upset, owing to his long history of failed leadership bids and his relative unpopularity with many LDP members of the National Diet. After his election, the Japanese stock market experienced a sudden drop in response to Ishiba&#x27;s economic policies, which was named &quot;Ishiba Shock&quot;.

Three days after the LDP presidential election, the new party officials under Ishiba were inaugurated. Ishiba appointed former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga vice president of the party, while the outgoing Vice President Tarō Asō was made chief advisor, and Hiroshi Moriyama became secretary general. Shun&#x27;ichi Suzuki was made chairman of the General Council after Takaichi declined the post. Itsunori Onodera was made chairman of the Policy Research Council and Shinjiro Koizumi chairman of the Election Strategy Committee. The appointments were seen as emphasizing stability in the party.

On 30 September, Ishiba announced his plans to dissolve the House of Representatives on 9 October and called for snap general election to be held on 27 October 2024. This decision, which was announced before he was elected Prime Minister by the Diet, drew criticism from opposition parties as it did not allow time for a debate at a budget committee meeting prior to the House&#x27;s dissolution. Despite this resistance, the Lower House voted in favor of closing the extraordinary Diet session on 9 October.

Ishiba was elected by the National Diet and appointed as Prime Minister by Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo Imperial Palace on 1 October 2024, becoming the twenty-fifth Liberal Democratic Prime Minister. Ishiba announced key appointments ahead of the snap general election on 27 October 2024. His Cabinet included rivals from the leadership race, though Sanae Takaichi&#x27;s exclusion created internal party friction. Uniting the divided ruling party became a primary focus for Ishiba after the closely contested leadership race.

In his first policy speech on 4 October, Ishiba named Japan&#x27;s low birth rate and the regional security situation as among his primary concerns, describing the former as a &quot;quiet emergency&quot; and the latter as at its &quot;most severe since the end of World War II&quot;. He also pledged to continue efforts to ensure the emergence of the Japanese economy from deflation and called for stabilization in the membership of the Imperial House of Japan amid a lack of male successors to the throne. He also expressed regret for the 2023–2024 Japanese slush fund scandal.

=== 2024 general election and Second Cabinet ===
On 9 October, Ishiba dissolved the House of Representatives in preparation for the general election on 27 October. On the same day, the LDP decided to pull its endorsement of 12 politicians implicated in the slush fund scandal, and would not allow them to be elected via proportional representation should they lose in their single seat constituencies. Ishiba indicated that the party would resume support for the politicians if they win reelection. Other politicians who have been disciplined by the party over the slush fund scandal would also not be allowed to run on the LDP&#x27;s proportional representation list. Despite these measures, LDP still faced its most serious defeat since the 2009 election, with 67 seats lost and therefore its majority in the Diet. On the next day, Ishiba expressed his intention to remain as Prime Minister despite the election results. Commentators noted that his decision for the snap election election may jeopardize his leadership, as rising inflation and a funding scandal threaten his LDP&#x27;s majority, prompting potential alliances with smaller parties amid growing economic concerns.

On 11 November, Ishiba was reelected as prime minister of a minority government during a session of the Diet, after winning a total of 221 votes from both the first and second rounds, defeating Yoshihiko Noda of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, who secured only 160 votes, following a second round runoff vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan: PM Ishiba chosen for new term, despite lost majority – DW – 11/11/2024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hours before the Diet assembled, Ishiba&#x27;s first cabinet resigned, thus resulting in him making an effort to launch a second cabinet. However, it was agreed that his cabinet would mostly remain the same. Ishiba&#x27;s re-election would also mark the first time in 30 years that any Japanese prime minister needed a runoff vote.

=== Domestic policy ===
During the opening ceremony of the 217th ordinary session of the Diet, Ishiba&#x27;s government submitted a draft budget for the new fiscal year 2025 with the general account at over 115 trillion yen, the largest ever. The unprecedentedly large budget was attributed to social security expenses related to the aging population and the strengthening of defense capabilities that began under the previous Kishida administration. On 24 January he delivered a policy speech, proclaiming his ideal for a &quot;fun Japan&quot; where everyone &quot;feels safe and secure, and people with diverse values respect each other and strive for self-realization.&quot; He also said he would prioritize regional revitalization, addressing the gender pay gap, and digitalization among other issues.

==== Social issues ====
Ishiba&#x27;s government announced in January 2025 that same-sex partners will be subject to the same regulations as common-law marriages in 24 laws, including one that stipulates benefits to be paid to the families of crime victims. Consideration for legislation allowing separate surnames for married couples also began in the LDP under Ishiba&#x27;s presidency. Ishiba&#x27;s former rival, Sanae Takaichi, urged him to approach the topic with &quot;caution&quot; during internal party deliberations. He has remained hesitant about introducing same-sex marriage legislation.

=== Foreign policy ===
 Ishiba was elected as Prime Minister during the closing months of Joe Biden&#x27;s presidency in the United States, meeting with him at the APEC summit in Peru in November 2024, alongside South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Later in January 2025 he held a virtual meeting with Biden and Philippine President Ferdniand Marcos Jr. during which the three agreed to strengthen ties and cooperation. After Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Ishiba congratulated him publicly, stating he would like to meet with him soon in his capacity as President-elect. Unlike his late former rival Shinzo Abe, Ishiba was not able to meet with Trump during his transition period. After Trump&#x27;s inauguration, he sent him a congratulatory letter, in which he emphasized the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific. By February a meeting was set up between the two; Ishiba stated that he would explain to Trump Japan&#x27;s high investment in the United States and its contributions to US job creation, mirroring a strategy implemented by Abe to negotiate with Trump when he was Prime Minister. Ishiba sought the advice of Abe&#x27;s widow, Akie Abe, along with former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida before the meeting. He said he would seek to form a “personal relationship” with Trump. Nevertheless, Ishiba and Trump were referred to as an “odd couple” by &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot;. 

Ishiba arrived in Washington D.C. on 6 February, along with translator Sunao Takao, who had previously assisted Shinzo Abe communicate with Trump during his tenure as Prime Minister. Takao was described as an “important asset” to Ishiba, given he is &quot;probably one of the few Japanese people that Trump remembers.&quot; Ishiba met with Trump the following day at the White House, where the two held a meeting followed by a press conference. During the meeting, Ishiba praised Trump, describing him as “very sincere.” He also referenced that attempted assassination of Trump that occurred in July 2024, and drew similarities between their domestic regional revitalization policies. When speaking to the press, Trump confirmed that Nippon Steel would invest in US Steel rather than own it. He also expressed his desire to “eliminate” the United States’ $68 billion trade deficit with Japan, believing there would not be “any problems” in the relationship between the two countries. Despite this, Trump did not rule out the possibility of levying tariffs on Japan, but said it was unlikely. During the press conference, Ishiba announced that Japan would be raising its investment in the United States to $1 billion, and that Toyota Motors and Isuzu Motors were planning to build new factories in the United States. On security, Trump said the US would continue to provide Japan with military security assistance, and praised its efforts to increase defense spending. The two also agreed to cooperate on deterring China&#x27;s economic power and reducing the threat of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. Trump and Ishiba agreed pursue a &quot;new golden age&quot; for U.S.-Japan relations.

In November 2024, Ishiba urged American President Joe Biden to approve Nippon-US Steel deal, which he ultimately blocked. Following the decision, Minister of Foreign Affairs Takeshi Iwaya visited China in December; the meeting was seen as signs of improving of ties. Later in January the LDP-led Japan-China Parliamentary Friendship Association made a trip to China. The meeting was the first of the Japan-China Ruling Party Exchange Council since October 2018. In January 2025, Ishiba&#x27;s government announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be easing visa requirements for Chinese tourists. The plan sparked criticism from within the LDP. Ishiba&#x27;s diplomatic stance regarding China was notably criticized by Kōichi Hagiuda, who demanded more thorough explanations for the recent shifts in policy.

In February 2025, Ishiba said that the government would consider offering medical care for sick and wounded residents of the Gaza strip, amidst Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas that has been ongoing since October 2023. He also said that educational opportunities could also be offered to people from Gaza.

Similar to his predecessor Fumio Kishida, Ishiba has maintained support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion that began in 2022. In February 2025, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani revealed that the Self-Defense Forces would provide approximately 30 additional transport vehicles to the Ukrainian military.

=== Gaffes ===
Ishiba has been criticized for several gaffes while in office. In October 2024, it emerged that government officials had edited an official photograph of Ishiba&#x27;s cabinet to hide signs of Ishiba looking unkempt. In November 2024, he appeared to have slept during a session of the Diet. At the APEC Peru 2024 summit, he was again criticized for greeting other world leaders while seated and watching a dance at the summit&#x27;s welcoming ceremony with his arms crossed. In another incident, he was seen publicly eating onigiri whole and munching on it without closing his mouth.

== Political positions ==

Ishiba has been described as a centrist, a moderate conservative, and a reformist, particularly during the 2024 Liberal Democratic Party presidential election. While he was cited as a member of the ultranationalist far-right organisation Nippon Kaigi, he has been criticized by nationalist commentators for his &quot;traitorous acts&quot;, and for being &quot;anti-Japan&quot;, and has pointed to Japan&#x27;s failure to face its war responsibilities as underlying &quot;many of its problems&quot;.

=== Social views ===
Ishiba has expressed support for introducing a selective dual surname system, which would allow married couples the option to retain their respective surnames. Ishiba has stated that this change should be subject to further discussion within the LDP to reach a consensus. Ishiba has expressed his support for same-sex marriage in Japan in his book, &quot;Conservative Politician&quot; (2024). However, after becoming prime minister, Ishiba stated he would take relevant court rulings into consideration since the country&#x27;s constitution regulated marriages. On 17 December 2024, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba made the following statement about same-sex marriage during a parliamentary session: “I have met concerned individuals, and I can see that being together is the most precious thing to them. While there is no ‘scale’ for measuring the national happiness, I believe that fulfilling these deepest wishes would have a positive and beneficial impact on the overall well-being of Japan&quot;.

In a 2004 speech to the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF), Ishiba, then Director General of the Japan Defense Agency, said that the SDF &quot;has sometimes been made fun of as the &#x27;autistic forces.&#x27; It&#x27;s the autistic forces as in autistic children.&quot; The remark was apparently intended as a pun, as the word he used for &quot;autistic forces&quot; (自閉隊, &quot;Jihei-tai&quot;) sounds similar to the word for Self-Defence Forces (自衛隊; &quot;Jiei-tai&quot;). The comment was meant to criticize the SDF for their poor communication, which resulted in a lack of public understanding about their activities. His comment was criticized as being inappropriate and showing a lack of awareness for autistic people. Ishiba later apologized for the comparison, saying &quot;I had read an article that had such a reference, but (my remarks) were truly inappropriate&quot;, and added: &quot;It is an undeniable fact that my remarks have hurt relevant parties, and I sincerely apologize. I will have to reflect (on my actions) and caution myself against repeating such an act.&quot;

=== Economic policy ===
As a representative for a rural district in Tottori Prefecture (with the smallest population among the forty-seven prefectures) and former &quot;Minister in charge of Overcoming Population Decline and Vitalizing Local Economy&quot;, Ishiba regularly emphasized the need to address socioeconomic inequality between Japan&#x27;s urban centers and rural areas, the latter of which faces population decline, aging demographics, and economic stagnation. On election night, Ishiba called on the LDP to propose a supplementary budget for the 2024 fiscal year, aimed at financing a stimulus package to help rural areas cope with rising costs.

Ishiba intends to maintain the economic policies under Kishida&#x27;s premiership to steer Japan out of years of deflation. He has called for a more &quot;fair&quot; tax system and seeks to increase taxes such as the capital gains tax. He believes the economy can only improve if consumption increases and stated his commitment to raising the minimum wage to 1,500 yen per hour by the end of the decade.

=== Foreign policy ===
During the 2013 North Korean crisis, Ishiba stated that Japan had the right to deliver a preemptive strike against North Korea. Ishiba is a vocal supporter of Taiwanese democracy. At the same time, he has called for stronger diplomacy and engagement with China, rather than antagonism.

In his memoir written during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ishiba argued that equating the Russian invasion with a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan stems more from emotional reactions rather than a pragmatic evaluation of the Chinese threat. Ishiba has criticized Kishida&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow&quot;. In 2024, he stated that the reason the US did not defend Ukraine is that Ukraine is not part of a collective self-defense system like NATO. Ishiba argued that the war transformed the global security environment and with the absence of such a collective self-defense system in Asia, wars are more likely to break out in the region as there is no obligation for mutual defense. He therefore stated that an Asian collective security alliance is necessary in order to deter China.

==== &quot;Asian NATO&quot; and US-Japan alliance ====

In September 2024, Ishiba claimed that the &quot;relative decline of U.S. might&quot; necessitates an Asian version of NATO to counter security threats from China, Russia, and North Korea. With the US-Japan alliance at its core, Ishiba proposed strengthening alliance relationships with Australia, Canada, the Philippines, India, France, the United Kingdom, and South Korea in order to form this &quot;Asian NATO&quot;. He said that one of the policy&#x27;s main goals is to protect Japan and that &quot;the security environment surrounding us is the toughest since the end of World War II.&quot; This proposed security alliance was quickly dismissed by Daniel Kritenbrink, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar also does not agree with Ishiba&#x27;s idea for an Asian NATO as it does not fit with India&#x27;s strategic goals. In response to Ishiba&#x27;s comments regarding an Asian version of NATO, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China spokesperson Lin Jian stated that &quot;China hopes that Japan will learn from history, follow a path of peaceful development, abide by the principles and common understandings established in the four political documents between the two sides [China and Japan], have an objective and right perception of China, take active and rational China policy, take concrete efforts to comprehensively advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit, and work with China to promote the sustained, sound and steady development of China-Japan relations.&quot; The Jakarta Post criticized the idea, claiming that it is aimed at &quot;unifying all available forces to band together against China, which would be considered very offensive for the 10-member ASEAN&quot;. During his first visit to Laos as prime minister, Ishiba did not mention anything related to the Asian NATO idea to reporters.
While campaigning, Ishiba stated that Japan&#x27;s alliance with the US, which he referred to as asymmetrical, should be re-balanced and called for greater Japanese oversight of American military bases in Japan. He said Japan should use the Special Relationship between the US, UK and France as a model for creating an alliance with the US as equal partners. To become an equal partner, he said Japan must have its own military strategy and a &quot;security system that can protect its own nation by itself&quot;. He also suggested that Japan Self-Defense Forces could be placed in Guam to strengthen the deterrence capabilities of the Japan-US alliance.

On his first call as prime minister with President Joe Biden, Ishiba said that he wants to further strengthen the U.S.–Japan Alliance. However, he did not mention his desire to make changes to the bilateral forces agreement that would be required in order to make the alliance more symmetrical. He said that he would find the chance to raise the issue with Biden in the future.

==== Historical awareness and Yasukuni Shrine ====
Following his victory in the 2024 LDP presidential election, some South Korean media outlets have described Ishiba as a &quot;dove&quot; in regards to his perception of Japan&#x27;s accountability in World War II. For example, in 2019 when South Korea decided to terminate the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) during the Japan–South Korea trade dispute, Ishiba stated that root of many of the problems between Japan and South Korea is Japan&#x27;s failure to face up to its wartime responsibility. However, in October 2024, Ishiba sent a ritual offering to Yasukuni Shrine, which drew criticism from South Korea.

Ishiba has criticised Japan and its government during World War II, stating that &quot;The government concluded that Japan was doomed to lose a war, yet entered it anyway. They should be held accountable for that&quot;, and similarly saying that &quot;I cannot understand why their actions that led to the defeat of the country, without giving accurate answers to Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s questions and without informing the public of the truth, are being left unquestioned as &#x27;we are all heroes once we die.&#x27;&quot; He said of the Tokyo Trials that, regardless of the issues in retroactively applying law, Japan is what it is because they &quot;accepted the trials&quot;. He further stated that the Tokyo Trials did not condemn everything in pre-war Japan as wrong, and that those who argue the Trials were invalid due to the retroactively applying law argue that there were no mistakes in pre-war Japan at all. He argued there was both wrong and right in the pre-war era. Regarding the Nanjing Massacre, Ishiba said: &quot;At the very least, the way prisoners of war were treated was incorrect, and military discipline was broken. We must also examine the civilian casualties which happened.&quot; He has refrained from using the word &quot;massacre&quot; to describe it. When it comes to comfort women, he has stated there was &quot;coercion in the narrow sense&quot;, clarifying he meant forced abduction by the government and military.

Regarding visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan&#x27;s war dead, including convicted Japanese war criminals, by state officials and statements rejecting the Japanese war crimes during World War II, he has questioned if this is in national interest, citing incidents where countries such as South Korea have become upset at the nation for rejecting responsibility for World War II and Japanese colonisation. Specifically as it comes to Yasukuni, he has argued there is no need for active politicians to visit the shrine, citing that it is the Emperor&#x27;s responsibility to visit the dead. He has said that it is particularly inappropriate for a prime minister to visit the Yasukuni Shrine due to concerns from China and South Korea. He has criticized visits by politicians as not essential to creating an environment where laws can be passed. Ishiba has not visited the shrine since he gained his first cabinet post in 2002. He instead visits his local Gokoku Shrines every 15 August. He is also an advocate of separating Class A war criminals from the shrine. He has defended the Murayama Statement, commenting after Sanae Takaichi said she felt uncomfortable with the statement in 2013 that he would like the party to &quot;refrain from making misleading statements&quot;.

=== Military affairs ===
Ishiba is known as a &quot;gunji otaku&quot; (military geek) and has a keen interest in military matters. He is known for having a lot of expertise related to weapons systems, legal issues about defense, and is also fond of building and painting models of aircraft and ships. Ishiba has repeatedly stated that he believes that Japan needs its own equivalent of the United States Marine Corps to be able to defend its many small islands. In 2010 when he was policy chief for the LDP in opposition, and as secretary-general of the party in March 2013 after the LDP regained government.

==== Nuclear weapons ====
In 2011, Ishiba backed the idea of Japan maintaining the capability of building nuclear weapons. He said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Japan needs to possess nuclear weapons, but it&#x27;s important to maintain our commercial reactors because it would allow us to produce a nuclear warhead in a short amount of time ... It&#x27;s a tacit nuclear deterrent.&quot; In 2017, Ishiba reiterated: &quot;Japan should have the technology to build a nuclear weapon if it wants to do so.&quot; In 2024, Ishiba said the region should consider introducing nuclear weapons if it wants an Asian version of NATO.

== Personal life ==
Ishiba met his wife Yoshiko Nakamura when they were both students at Keio University. They got married in 1983 and have two daughters. Ishiba is a Christian, specifically a Protestant. He was baptised at the age of 18 in the Tottori Church of the United Church of Christ in Japan. In recent years he has attended the Evangelical CBMC&#x27;s National Prayer Breakfast. He also visits the Buddhist graves of his ancestors and worships at a Shinto shrine.

Ishiba is known as an &quot;otaku&quot; with a very high interest in the military, vehicles, and trains, and keeps a large collection of military-related plastic models, some of which are displayed at his office in the Diet. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as a &quot;bookish idealist&quot; in 2024. He is also a fan of the 1970s idol group Candies, is known to ride on sleeper trains to Tottori Prefecture as part of his interest in railways, and regards novelists Soseki Natsume and Ogai Mori as two of his favorite authors. Ishiba is also known as an avid reader, wherein he is noted to read three books daily, and stated that he &quot;prefers reading more than mingle with his party collegues&quot;. He is also the head of an intraparty ramen society that was established to promote the dish.

Ishiba made headlines when he allowed a Japan Self-Defense Forces vehicle to be displayed at the Shizuoka Hobby Show, a trade fair for plastic and radio-controlled models. During the visit of former United States Ambassador to Japan Howard Baker in 2002, Ishiba presented a plastic model of the Lockheed P-3 Orion in their meeting at his office. When the Russian Defence Minister visited Japan, Ishiba was said to have stayed up all night assembling a plastic model of the aircraft carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;.

Ishiba is also known to be a heavy smoker.

<text>A keytar (a portmanteau of &quot;keyboard&quot; and &quot;guitar&quot;) is a keyboard instrument similar to a synthesizer or MIDI controller that is supported by a strap around the neck and shoulders, similar to the way a guitar is held.

== Overview ==
Though the term &quot;keytar&quot; has been used since the introduction of the instrument, it was not used by a major manufacturer until 2012, when the Alesis company referred to the &quot;Vortex&quot;, the company&#x27;s first product of this type, as a &quot;USB/MIDI Keytar Controller”.

Keytars allow players a greater range of movement onstage, compared to conventional keyboards, which are placed on stationary stands or which are part of heavy, floor-mounted structures. The instrument has a musical keyboard for triggering musical notes and sounds. Various controls are placed on the instrument&#x27;s &quot;neck&quot;, including those for pitch bends, vibrato, portamento, and sustain.

Keytars may either contain their own synthesizer engines, or be MIDI controllers. In either case, a keytar needs to be connected to a keyboard amplifier or PA system to produce a sound that the performer and audience can hear. MIDI controller keytars trigger notes and other MIDI data on an external MIDI-capable synthesizer, sound module or computer with synthesizer software. While a keytar is usually used to create musical sounds, like any other MIDI controller it could also be used to trigger such devices as MIDI-enabled lighting controllers, effects devices and audio consoles.

== History ==

===Early history (18th century–1970s) ===
The oldest forerunner of the keytar is likely the orphica, a small portable piano invented in Vienna in 1795, which was played in a similar position as the modern keytar. The piano accordion first appeared in 1852, it was essentially a Miniature version of the Reed Organ that&#x27;s worn on straps and is pumped with the player&#x27;s left hand. In 1963, the East German manufacturer &quot;Weltmeister&quot; introduced the &quot;Basset&quot;, as a Keytar shaped Electric Bass Piano.
In 1966, Swedish organ manufacturer Joh Mustad AB introduced the Tubon, a tubular electric organ. This instrument was worn with a strap around the shoulder and could be played standing or sitting. The Tubon had a half-keyboard on one end accessible to the right hand, controls to be used at the &quot;neck&quot; on the opposite end for the left hand, and a speaker at the end of the tube. It was sold in the UK as the Livingstone. It saw use by Kraftwerk and Paul McCartney in the 1960s and early 1970s.

In the early 1970s, Edgar Winter often performed with keyboards slung around his neck, but they were not technically keytars because they had no &quot;neck&quot;; he actually used an ARP 2600 keyboard and a lightweight Univox electronic piano with shoulder straps added.
===Keytar as synthesizer/controller (1970s–) ===

The earlier keytars commercially released in late 1970s–early 1980s includes:
* Hillwood &quot;RockeyBoard RB-1&quot; (synth piano with VCF) released in 1977 with influence from Edgar Winter,
* PMS &quot;Syntar&quot;, an early keytar synthesizer released by George Mattson (Performance Music Systems) and exhibited at the 1979 NAMM International Music &amp; Sound Expo in Atlanta
* Davis &quot;Clavitar&quot; (controller) used by George Duke and Herbie Hancock in early 1980
* &quot;Powell Probe&quot; (controller) designed by Roger Powell, and
* &quot;Royalex Probe&quot; (controller) helped to develop and used by Jan Hammer in early 1980s
&quot;etc&quot;. (&quot;for details, see&quot; List of keytars)

In late 1970s and early 1980s, Jan Hammer, the composer best known for his composition and sound design successes for &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, frequently used several keytars including &quot;Royalex PROBE&quot; which he helped develop. Hammer is seen for instance using his PROBE in the music video for the &quot;&quot;Miami Vice&quot; Theme&quot;. Also in the 1980s, Wayne Famous of the band the Producers strapped on a regular Oberheim OB-X synthesizer, which caused him to develop back problems.

Among them, the most widely known earlier keytar may be the &quot;Moog Liberation&quot; released in 1980. Early users included Spyro Gyra keyboardist Tom Schuman. Though Devo is associated with keytars, they never used them except in music videos and promotional ads for the Liberation. The earliest printed use of the word &quot;keytar&quot; was in 1980, when it appeared in an interview with Jeffrey Abbott (Keytarjeff) by Tom Lounges of &quot;Illianabeat&quot; magazine (now &quot;Midwest BEAT Magazine&quot;) who now hosts a weekly interview show featuring legends of the music industry on N.W. Indiana&#x27;s PBR radio station.

Although Steve Masakowski has been incorrectly credited for many years as the inventor of the keytar, in an interview with Peter Hartlaub of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on December 11, 2009, he only claimed to have invented an instrument called the Key-tar which was a string-based instrument.

The keytar was made popular in the 1980s by glam metal bands, as well as synthpop, new wave and electro musicians. Changing trends in music diminished the keytar&#x27;s popularity during the 1990s, continuing on until the late 2000s when a major revival was sparked by artists and groups such as The Black Eyed Peas, Damas Gratis, Flight of The Conchords, Motion City Soundtrack, No Doubt, and Steely Dan. Another instance is in early 2008 with Snoop Dogg&#x27;s music video for his single &quot;Sensual Seduction&quot;, in which he uses a keytar as a throwback to old school bands.

=== Current state (2010s–) ===
Notable manufacturers of keytar models have included Moog, Roland, Yamaha, Korg and Casio. As of 2013, the Roland AX-Synth, the Roland Lucina, the Alesis Vortex and Rock Band 3 Wireless Pro Keyboard, are the mass-manufactured keytars on the market.

Starr Labs manufacturers a variation on the keytar (called a Ztar) that plays to the strengths of guitarists, featuring a neck of piano-styled keys arranged on the fretboard instead of strings.

== Examples ==
===1980s–1990s===
The Moog Liberation was released in 1980 by Moog Music, and was considered the first mass-produced strap synthesizer. It included two monophonic VCOs and a polyphonic section that could play organ sounds. The neck had spring-loaded wheels for filter cutoff, modulation, and volume as well as a ribbon-controlled pitch bend. The Liberation had a single VCF and two ADS envelope generators.

The Roland SH-101 is a small, 32-key, monophonic analog synthesizer from the early 1980s. It has one oscillator with two waveforms, an &#x27;octave-divided&#x27; sub-oscillator, and a low-pass filter/VCF capable of self oscillation. When a shoulder strap is connected to it, and the small handgrip with a pitch bend wheel and a pitch modulation trigger is used, the SH-101 becomes a keytar.
The Yamaha SHS-10, released in 1987, has a small keyboard with 32 minikeys and a pitch-bend wheel, an internal Frequency modulation (usually referred to as FM) synthesizer offering 25 different voices with 6-note polyphony. Onboard voices include a range of keyboard instruments (pipe organ, piano, electric piano, etc.); strings (violin, guitar, double bass, etc.); and wind and brass (clarinet, flute, trumpet, etc.). A larger model, the Yamaha SHS-200, was released the following year, and came with 49 keys and dual stereo speakers.

===2000s–present===
The Roland AX-7, which was manufactured from 2001 to 2007, contains many more advanced features than early keytars. It has 45 velocity sensitive keys (without aftertouch), and a 3-character LED display. Several features aimed towards stage performance are present, such as a pitch bend ribbon, touchpad-like expression bar, sustain switch, and volume control knob, all on the upper neck of the instrument. There is also a proprietary &quot;D-Beam&quot; interface, made up of infrared sensors that detect nearby motion. This interface can be used to trigger and control effects.

In August 2009, Roland released the Roland AX-Synth, a model of keytar that contains its own synthesizer sounds in addition to being a MIDI/USB controller. In 2010, Roland released the Roland Lucina AX-09. This model does not have a traditional neck, but is still considered a keytar because of it is a strap-on model and is in the AX line, with many identical features to its AX predecessors. It is unique in that it includes an additional, front panel USB port to accommodate a USB flash drive, which may contain MP3, WAV or AIFF files for playback. The Lucina has 150 internal sounds and may also be used as a MIDI/USB controller.

Also in 2010, Mad Catz released the Wireless Pro Keyboard for Rock Band 3, a 25-key velocity-sensitive MIDI-compatible keytar controller. Despite its sub-$100 price, it is designed for serious use outside of the game. Synthpop band Freezepop have used it on stage.

In 2012, Alesis released its first keytar and is the first major manufacturer to actually use the term &quot;keytar&quot; in the model name and description. The Alesis Vortex USB/MIDI Keytar Controller is unique in that it includes eight velocity-sensitive drum pads/sample triggers, which enable the performer to create beats or trigger clips, built right into the body of the keytar. It also features an accelerometer, which allows the performer to control MIDI parameters by tilting the neck. Although Alesis claims to have manufactured &quot;the first USB keytar controller&quot;, the Roland AX-Synth and the Roland Lucina feature USB connections with the same function and were released three years prior to the Alesis Vortex.

<text>The Yamaha SHS-10, known in Yamaha&#x27;s native country, Japan, as the Yamaha Sholky, Sholky being derived from &quot;Shoulder Keyboard&quot;, is a keytar (a musical keyboard that can be held like a guitar) manufactured by Yamaha and released in 1987.

It has a small-sized keyboard with 32 minikeys and a pitch-bend wheel, vibrato and sustain buttons, an internal Frequency modulation (usually referred to as FM) synthesizer offering 25 different voices with 6-note polyphony, two operators, and a very basic chord sequencer. It also has a loudspeaker.

It supports MIDI, having a MIDI Out connector which allows the keyboard to control external MIDI equipment. It does not have a MIDI In connector. Although originally made for the consumer market, this keytar&#x27;s MIDI out features are very powerful. Its drum rhythms and accompaniment are transmitted on separate MIDI channels, so that an external drum machine, sampler, or other MIDI equipment can be programmed to play the backing parts. Drums are transmitted on channel 16; Bass on 15; and three chord harmonies on channels 12-14. MIDI start/stop and tempo sync are also transmitted so an external sequencer may be utilized as well.

It was manufactured in three colors: grey, red, and black.

Its demo is an arrangement of Wham!&#x27;s hit &quot;Last Christmas.&quot;

The Voices are the following:
The numbering scheme reflects the fact that the selection is done with buttons numbered 0-4.

A larger model, the Yamaha SHS-200, was released the following year, and came with 49 keys and dual stereo speakers.

<text>The Hawai`i Maritime Center is now part of the Hawaii Pacific University&#x27;s campus but was the principal maritime museum in the State of Hawai`i from 1988 until it closed in 2009. Located at Pier 7 of Honolulu Harbor east of Aloha Tower, the center was a campus of the Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. The Hawai`i Maritime Center was built on what once was the private boathouse of King David Kalakaua and was home to the only four-masted, full-rigged ship in the world called the &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot;. The &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; was built in 1878 for the oil industry and is a National Historic Landmark. Also docked at the Hawai`i Maritime Center was the voyaging canoe &quot;Hokule`a&quot;, a scientific research vessel of great importance to native Hawaiian culture.

Due to prevailing economic conditions, the Hawai&#x27;i Maritime Center was closed to the public effective May 1, 2009. In December 2017, the Bishop Museum transferred its lease between the Maritime Center and the State of Hawaii to a third party, and ceased operating the center. Plans for its future were unknown at that time. This third party would be known as the Hawaii Pacific University and in 2015, the facility was converted to be part of its campus.

<text>Falls of Clyde is the last surviving iron-hulled, four-masted full-rigged ship, and the only remaining sail-driven oil tanker. She was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1989, but deregistered in 2024 due to her condition. Hawaii is seeking proposals to scrap the ship. She is currently not open to the public.

==History==
Russell and Company built &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; in Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, Scotland. She was launched as the first of nine iron-hulled four-masted ships for Wright and Breakenridge&#x27;s Falls Line. She was named after the Falls of Clyde, a group of waterfalls on the River Clyde, and built to the highest standard for general worldwide trade, Lloyd&#x27;s Register A-1. Her maiden voyage took her to Karachi, then to British India, and her first six years were spent engaged in the India trade. She then became a tramp pursuing general cargo such as lumber, jute, cement, and wheat from ports in Australia, California, India, New Zealand, and the British Isles.
After twenty-one years as a British merchant ship, &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; was bought for US$25,000 by Captain William Matson of the Matson Navigation Company, taken to Honolulu in 1899, and registered under the Hawaiian flag. When the Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1900, it took a special act of the United States Congress to secure the foreign-built ship the right to sail as an American flag vessel.

To economize on crew, Matson rigged &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; down as a barque, replacing the five yards on her (jigger) mast with two more easily managed fore-and-aft sails. At the same time, he added a deckhouse, charthouse, and rearranged the after quarters to accommodate paying passengers. From 1899 to 1907, she made over sixty voyages between Hilo, Hawaii, and San Francisco, California, carrying general merchandise west, sugar east, and passengers both ways. She developed a reputation as a handy, fast, and commodious vessel, averaging 17 days each way on her voyages.

In 1907, the Associated Oil Company (later Tidewater Oil) bought &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; and converted her to a bulk oil tanker with a capacity of . Ten large steel tanks were built into her hull, and a pump room, boiler and generator fitted forward of an oil-tight bulkhead. In this configuration she brought kerosene to Hawaii and returned it to California with molasses for cattle feed.

In 1927, she was sold to the General Petroleum Company, her masts cut down, and converted into a floating fuel depot in Alaska. In 1959 she was bought by William Mitchell, who towed her to Seattle, Washington, intending to sell her to a preservation group. Mitchell&#x27;s plan fell through and subsequent efforts by Karl Kortum, director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum, and Fred Klebingat, who had sailed in her as chief mate in 1915, to place her in Long Beach, California, or Los Angeles, California, were similarly disappointed.

In 1963, the bank holding the mortgage on &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; decided to sell her to be sunk as part of a breakwater at Vancouver, British Columbia. Kortum and Klebingat aroused interest in the ship in Hawaii, and within days of the scheduled scuttling raised funds to buy the ship. At the end of October 1963, &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; was taken under tow bound for Honolulu.

==As a museum ship==
 
&quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; was given to the Bishop Museum and opened to the public in 1968. In 1970 shipbuilder and industrialist Sir William Lithgow, the grandson of original 19th century designer William Lithgow, was engaged to assist in her restoration as a full-rigged ship. His Port Glasgow shipyard donated new steel masts, and topgallants, jib and spanker booms of Oregon pine.

In 1973 the ship was entered into the National Register of Historic Places, and declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1989.

In 1982 the ship was seriously damaged in Hurricane Iwa. By 2008 she was in poor condition. Causes of the deterioration of the ship are multiple. The ship has not been dry docked for a long time and preventive maintenance has not been performed. The Bishop Museum, &quot;has been accused of incompetence and dishonesty&quot; for raising $600,000 to preserve the ship but then spending only about half that, and for other decisions on how the money that was spent.

In 2008, the Bishop Museum announced plans to sink her by the end of the year unless private funds were raised for an endowment for her perpetual care. In September 2008, the Bishop Museum was persuaded to transfer ownership to the non-profit group Friends of Falls of Clyde, which intended to restore her. Many artefacts and fixtures had previously been given away, taken, or otherwise disappeared on the assumption that the ship was to be scuttled. $350,000 was obtained from the Robert J. Pfeiffer Foundation, but hoped-for federal funds under the &quot;Save America&#x27;s Treasures&quot; program or other programs did not come through. Each year, the Foundation hoped to get her into drydock but did not succeed. In June 2016 Harbors Division of the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) revoked the permit for her to moor at Pier 7, citing safety and security risks to port users.

==Restoration and repatriation efforts==

In August 2016 a group based in Glasgow, Scotland launched the Save Falls of Clyde – International (FOCI) Campaign, with a view to returning the vessel to Scotland. Initially, they answered a call for help from the charity known as the &#x27;Friends of the Falls of Clyde&#x27; (FFOC) who owned and wanted to save the FOC from being scuttled. A plan was put together with an attempt to work with HDOT and building and executing a plan.

In February 2019 HDOT put the ship up for auction, however, there were no qualified bids.

In July 2021 HDOT solicited bids for removal of the ship from Honolulu Harbor, two proposals were received. The Foundation challenged the Harbors Division&#x27;s assessment of the ship, and says they never gave up ownership rights.

In November 2021 HDOT accepted a bid from FOCI to transport the ship to either Greenock or Glasgow where it would be restored. In March 2022 David O&#x27;Neill of FOCI said, &quot;There&#x27;s just a few legal and technical points to be ironed out, and then we will finalise the contract.&quot; HDOT canceled the bid in May 2022 after they said FOCI failed to meet conditions of the contract. 

The state has since begun the process of soliciting bids for scrapping the ship, and it has been delisted from the Hawaii Register of Historic Places. Delistings from the National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks programs were pending in early January 2024. The ship was delisted from the National Register on February 1, 2024, and its landmark designation was removed in December 2024.

==In popular culture==
* The ship appears as a filming location in &quot;Magnum, P.I.,&quot; Season 2, Episodes 5 and 6, &quot;Memories are Forever&quot; (5 November 1981) and Season 6, Episode 10, &quot;Blood and Honor&quot; (21 November 1985).

<doc id="825332" wikidata="Q1320143" url="?curid=825332" title="Purebred">
<text>Purebreds are like cultivars of an animal species achieved through the process of selective breeding. When the lineage of a purebred animal is recorded, that animal is said to be pedigreed. Purebreds breed true-to-type which means the progeny of like-to-like purebred parents will carry the same phenotype, or observable characteristics of the parents. A group of like purebreds is called a pure-breeding line or strain.

==True breeding==
In the world of selective animal breeding, to &quot;breed true&quot; means that specimens of an animal breed will breed true-to-type when mated like-to-like; that is, that the progeny of any two individuals of the same breed will show fairly consistent, replicable and predictable characteristics, or traits with sufficiently high heritability. A puppy from two purebred dogs of the same breed, for example, will exhibit the traits of its parents, and not the traits of all breeds in the subject breed&#x27;s ancestry.

Breeding from too small a gene pool, especially direct inbreeding, can lead to the passing on of undesirable characteristics or even a collapse of a breed population due to inbreeding depression. Therefore, there is a question, and often heated controversy, as to when or if a breed may need to allow &quot;outside&quot; stock in for the purpose of improving the overall health and vigor of the breed.

Because pure-breeding creates a limited gene pool, purebred animal breeds are also susceptible to a wide range of congenital health problems. This problem is especially prevalent in competitive dog breeding and dog show circles due to the singular emphasis on aesthetics rather than health or function. Such problems also occur within certain segments of the horse industry for similar reasons. The problem is further compounded when breeders practice inbreeding. The opposite effect to that of the restricted gene pool caused by pure-breeding is known as hybrid vigor, which generally results in healthier animals.

==Pedigrees==
A pedigreed animal is one that has its ancestry recorded. Often this is tracked by a major registry. The number of generations required varies from breed to breed, but all pedigreed animals have papers from the registering body that attest to their ancestry.

The word &quot;pedigree&quot; appeared in the English language in 1410 as &quot;pee de Grewe&quot;, &quot;pedegrewe&quot; or &quot;pedegru&quot;, each of those words being borrowed to the Middle French &quot;pié de grue&quot;, meaning &quot;crane foot&quot;. This comes from a visual analogy between the trace of the bird&#x27;s foot and the three lines used in the English official registers to show the ramifications of a genealogical tree.

Sometimes the word &quot;purebred&quot; is used synonymously with &quot;pedigreed&quot;, but purebred refers to the animal having a known ancestry, and pedigree refers to the written record of breeding. Not all purebred animals have their lineage in written form. For example, until the 20th century, the Bedouin people of the Arabian Peninsula only recorded the ancestry of their Arabian horses via an oral tradition, supported by the swearing of religiously based oaths as to the asil or &quot;pure&quot; breeding of the animal. Conversely, some animals may have a recorded pedigree or even a registry, but not be considered &quot;purebred&quot;. Today the modern Anglo-Arabian horse, a cross of Thoroughbred and Arabian bloodlines, is considered such a case.

==By type==
===Dogs===
A &quot;purebred dog&quot; is a dog of a modern breed of dog, with written documentation showing the individual purebred dog&#x27;s descent from its breeds&#x27; foundation stock. In dogs, the term breed is used two ways: loosely, to refer to dog types or landraces of dog (also called natural breeds or ancient breeds); or more precisely, to refer to modern breeds of dog, which are documented so as to be known to be descended from specific ancestors, that closely resemble others of their breed in appearance, movement, way of working and other characters; and that reproduce with offspring closely resembling each other and their parents. Purebred dogs are breeds in the second sense.

New breeds of dog are constantly being created, and there are many websites for new breed associations and breed clubs offering legitimate registrations for new or rare breeds. When dogs of a new breed are &quot;visibly similar in most characteristics&quot; and have reliable documented descent from a &quot;known and designated foundation stock&quot;, then they can then be considered members of a breed, and, if an individual dog is documented and registered, it can be called &quot;purebred&quot;.

===Cats===

A cat whose ancestry is formally registered is called a pedigreed or purebred cat. Technically, a &quot;purebred&quot; cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. A &quot;pedigreed&quot; cat is one whose ancestry is recorded with a cat registry, but may have ancestors of different breeds. &quot;Landraces&quot; are not cat breeds, but a selective group of representative cats can be used as foundation stock to create a new cat breed (examples of breeds created in this way are the Maine Coon, European Shorthair and Siberian).

Because of common crossbreeding in populated areas, most cats are simply identified as belonging to the unregistered non-pedigree cats of mixed or unknown ancestry, referred to as domestic long-haired and domestic short-haired cat, depending on their fur length. Other commonly used terms are random-bred cat, domestic cat, house(hold) cat or moggie/moggy (UK English). Out of the hundreds of millions of cats worldwide, almost none have any purebred ancestors, nor belong to a specific breed, because purebred cats are a human invention of the last 150 years and selectively bred from foundation stock by breeders in closed off lineages.

Approximately 3–4% of the cats in the US are purchased from breeders. Not all breeders sell registered pedigree cats. In France, approximately 4% of cats are pedigreed. Worldwide the number of pedigreed cats is somewhat lower, and is estimated at approximately 1–2%.

By definition all cats belonging to a specific breed are pedigreed cats with a known and formally registered ancestry with one of the cat registries, also known as the cat’s “paperwork” or pedigree. The list of cat breeds is quite large: most cat registries actually recognize between 30 and 75 breeds of cats, and several more are in development, with one or more new breeds being recognized each year on average, having distinct features (phenotype) and lineage. Nowadays, there exist over 100 cat breeds and varieties recognized by at least one of the official cat registries. The purpose of the registry of cat breeds is to develop and maintain a healthy breed by controlling inbreeding and the spread of hereditary diseases, and regulating the well-being of the cats. Owners and breeders compete in cat shows to see whose animal bears the closest resemblance (best &quot;conformance&quot;) to an idealized definition, based on breed type and the breed standard for each breed.

Modern breeders created cat breeds, which are actually feline hybrids between a wild cat species and the domestic cat species (&quot;Felis catus&quot; ). A famous example of such a hybrid cat breed is the Savannah cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot; × &quot;Leptailurus serval&quot; ), which is produced by crossing wild servals with domestic cats.

Some natural, ancient breeds of cat that have a distinct phenotype were formerly considered or speculated to be subspecies of wild cats or domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), or hybrids between them. Later genetic research shows that only one wild cat species was domesticated; the north African and southwest Asian wild cat (&quot;Felis silvestris lybica&quot;). All domestic (non-hybrid) cats and cat breeds fall under the domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), and are no longer considered separate (sub)species. The domestication of the &quot;Felis silvestris lybica&quot; started around 9.000 years ago in the Near East and Egypt region, while the selective breeding of purebred/pedigreed cat breeds only started 150 years ago.

=== Horses ===

Written and oral histories of various animals or pedigrees of certain types of horse have been kept throughout history, though breed registry stud books trace back to about the 13th century, at least in Europe, when pedigrees were tracked in writing, and the practice of declaring a type of horse to be a breed or a purebred became more widespread.

Certain horse breeds, such as the Andalusian horse and the Arabian horse, are claimed by aficionados of the respective breeds to be ancient, near-pure descendants from an ancient wild prototype, though mapping of the horse genome as well as the mtDNA and y-DNA of various breeds has largely disproved such claims.

===Livestock===

Most domesticated farm animals among others can also have true-breeding breeds and breed registries, particularly cattle, water buffaloes, sheep, goats, donkeys, guinea pigs, chickens, fancy pigeons, domestic ducks, rabbits, and pigs. While animals bred strictly for market sale are not always purebreds, or if purebred may not be registered, most livestock producers value the presence of purebred genetic stock for the consistency of traits such animals provide. It is common for a farm&#x27;s male breeding stock in particular to be of purebred, pedigreed lines.

In cattle, some breeders associations make a difference between &quot;purebred&quot; and &quot;full blood&quot;. Full blood cattle are fully pedigreed animals, where every ancestor is registered in the herdbook and shows the typical characteristics of the breed. Purebred are those animals that have been bred-up to purebred status as a result of using full blood animals to cross with an animal of another breed.

Artificial breeding via artificial insemination or embryo transfer is often used in sheep and cattle breeding to quickly expand, or improve purebred herds. Embryo transfer techniques allow top quality female livestock to have a greater influence on the genetic advancement of a herd or flock in much the same way that artificial insemination has allowed greater use of superior sires.

<doc id="825358" wikidata="Q4734201" url="?curid=825358" title="Aloha Tower Marketplace">
<text>The Aloha Tower Marketplace is a waterfront shopping center in Honolulu, Hawaii. Located at the Honolulu Harbor, the Aloha Tower Marketplace includes several national historic landmarks including the Aloha Tower, Falls of Clyde and Hawaii Maritime Center.

== History ==
Aloha Tower Marketplace was completed in 1994 as part of a Honolulu Harbor commercial revitalization project. It was acquired by Aloha Tower LP in 1998.

In 2002, the Marketplace filed for bankruptcy. It had been operating at a loss because of its distance from other tourist areas, lack of parking, and mismanagement. The bankruptcy led to the reorganization of shops in the Marketplace.

The museum at the Falls of Clyde focused on historic sailing and Polynesian sailing customs. Occasionally, outrigger canoes were displayed at the Hawaii Maritime Center as well. The museum closed May 1, 2009 due to lack of revenue.

Hawaii Pacific University partnered with a developer to own the Marketplace in 2011, and a few years later in 2013, they bought out the developer and took complete control of the facility. They renovated the shopping center into a mixed-use facility with retail, restaurant, and HPU student dormitories. The redevelopment, which began in 2012 has been complicated by disputes between development entities, permitting issues and staff-reductions. The project was completed in 2015.

==Dining and entertainment==
Prior to the renovation, major annual events occurred at Aloha Tower Marketplace, including fireworks displays on the Fourth of July and New Year&#x27;s Eve, ukulele contests, and Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The Great Aloha Run passes the Aloha Tower Marketplace.

<doc id="825382" wikidata="Q665523" url="?curid=825382" title="Leigh Light">
<text>The Leigh Light (L/L) was a British World War II era anti-submarine device used in the Battle of the Atlantic. It was a powerful (22 million candelas) carbon arc searchlight of diameter fitted to a number of the British Royal Air Force&#x27;s Coastal Command patrol bombers to help them spot surfaced German U-boats at night.

Early night operations with the new air-to-surface-vessel (ASV) radar demonstrated that the radar&#x27;s minimum range of about meant that the target was still invisible when it disappeared off the radar display. Efforts to reduce this minimum were not successful, so wing commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh hit upon the idea of using a searchlight that would be switched on just when the target was about to disappear on radar. The U-boat had insufficient time to dive and the bombardier had a clear view of the target. Introduced in June 1942, it was so successful that for a time German submarines were forced to switch to charging their batteries during the daytime, when they could at least see aircraft approaching.

Germany introduced the Metox radar warning receiver in an effort to counter the combination of ASV and Leigh Light. Metox provided the submarine crew with early warning that an aircraft using radar was approaching. Because the radar warning receiver could detect radar emissions at a greater range than the radar could detect vessels, this often gave the U-boat enough time to dive. Having expected this, the Allies introduced the centimetric ASV Mk. III radar, regaining control of the battle. Although the German Naxos countered these radars, by this time the U-boat force was already damaged beyond repair.

==Development==
Early air-to-surface radar sets, namely the ASV Mk. II, had an inconveniently long minimum detection range. Thus as the aircraft approached the target, it would disappear off the radar at a range that was too great to allow it to be seen by eye at night without some form of illumination. At first, aircraft solved this problem by dropping flares to illuminate the area, but since the flare illuminated only the area directly beneath the aircraft, a series of flares in succession would have to be dropped until the submarine was spotted. Once it was spotted, the aircraft would circle back to attack, the entire process giving the submarine time to dive.

Eventually, time-delayed flares were developed that allowed the attacking plane time to circle. The flare was fired into the air from a buoy previously dropped by the plane. The surfaced submarine could then be seen in silhouette as the plane approached.

Wing Commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh, an RAF personnel officer, devised a solution after chatting with returning aircrew. This was to mount a searchlight under the aircraft, pointed forward and allowing the submarine to be spotted as soon as the light was turned on. He then developed the Leigh Light on his own, in secret and without official sanction—even the Air Ministry were unaware of its development until shown the completed prototype. At first it was difficult to fit on aircraft due to its size. Leigh persisted in his efforts to test the idea and garnered the support of the Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, Sir Frederick Bowhill. In March 1941 a Vickers Wellington DWI that conveniently already had the necessary generator on board (it had been used for anti-magnetic mining operations using a large electromagnet) was modified with a retractable &quot;dustbin&quot; holding the lamp and proved the concept sound.

At this point the Air Ministry decided that the idea was worthwhile, but that they should instead use the Turbinlite, a less effective system which had been originally developed as an aid for night-time bomber interception. After trials they too eventually decided to use Leigh&#x27;s system, but it was not until mid-1942 that aircraft started being modified to carry it. Development assistance and production was by Savage and Parsons Ltd. of Watford led by Jack Savage.

==Operation==
Two types of Leigh Light entered operational use:

#The Turret type, fitted on Wellington aircraft, was a searchlight mounted in a retractable under-turret controlled by hydraulic motor and ram. The maximum beam intensity was 50 million candelas without the spreading lens and about 20 million candelas with the lens. Total weight was .
#The Nacelle type, fitted on Catalinas and Liberators, was a searchlight mounted in a nacelle in diameter slung from the bomb lugs on the wing. The controls were electric and the maximum beam intensity was 90 million candelas without the spreading lens and about 17 million with the lens. Total weight was .

By June 1942, aircraft equipped with ASV radar and the Leigh Light were operating over the Bay of Biscay intercepting U-boats moving to and from their home ports on the coast of France. The first submarine to be successfully sighted was the Italian submarine &quot;Torelli&quot;, on the night of 3 June 1942, and the first confirmed kill was the , sunk on 5 July 1942 by a Vickers Wellington of 172 Squadron, piloted by American Wiley B. Howell. In the previous five months not one submarine had been sunk, and six aircraft had been lost. The Leigh Light turned the tables, and by August the U-boats preferred to take their chances in daytime when they had some warning and could fight back.

At least one Fairey Swordfish I biplane torpedo bomber was trialled with a Leigh Light under the lower port wing, with a large battery pack slung under the fuselage where the torpedo would normally be carried. The armament was a rack of anti-submarine bombs carried under the other wing. With such a heavy load performance was poor with a top speed marginally above the stall speed. A Swordfish III was also fitted with a Leigh Light under the starboard wing, at some point, although it is unclear where the battery pack was stowed as the ASV radar scanner apparently filled the torpedo area.

Wing Commander Peter Cundy was also given the Air Force Cross for his part in the development of the Leigh Light.

==Training==

The observation post and concrete indicator arrow at Putsborough were built for Leigh Light training. A buoy anchored in Morte Bay was used as a target. Two other sites at Woolacombe and midway along the bay provided triangulation to assess the accuracy of the bombing attempt.

==Effectiveness==
Before the Leigh Light, not a single enemy submarine had been sunk in over five months, but in combination with radar, it was so overwhelmingly effective that many German submarine crews chose to surface during the day so that they could at least see the aircraft attacking them and have a chance to fire their anti-aircraft weaponry in defense.

<doc id="825390" wikidata="Q6696419" url="?curid=825390" title="Luce's choice axiom">
<text>In probability theory, Luce&#x27;s choice axiom, formulated by R. Duncan Luce (1959), states that the relative odds of selecting one item over another from a pool of many items is not affected by the presence or absence of other items in the pool. Selection of this kind is said to have &quot;independence from irrelevant alternatives&quot; (IIA).

==Overview==
Consider a set formula_1 of possible outcomes, and consider a selection rule formula_2, such that for any formula_3 with formula_4 a finite set, the selector selects formula_5 from formula_4 with probability formula_7.

Luce proposed two choice axioms. The second one is usually meant by &quot;Luce&#x27;s choice axiom&quot;, as the first one is usually called &quot;independence from irrelevant alternatives&quot; (IIA).

Luce&#x27;s choice axiom 1 (IIA): if formula_8, then for any formula_9, we still have formula_10.

Luce&#x27;s choice axiom 2 (&quot;path independence&quot;): formula_11for any formula_12.

Luce&#x27;s choice axiom 1 is implied by choice axiom 2.

=== Matching law formulation ===
Define the matching law selection rule formula_13, for some &quot;value&quot; function formula_14. This is sometimes called the softmax function, or the Boltzmann distribution.

Theorem: Any matching law selection rule satisfies Luce&#x27;s choice axiom. Conversely, if formula_15 for all formula_3, then Luce&#x27;s choice axiom implies that it is a matching law selection rule.

==Applications==
In economics, it can be used to model a consumer&#x27;s tendency to choose one brand of product over another.

In behavioral psychology, it is used to model response behavior in the form of matching law.

In cognitive science, it is used to model approximately rational decision processes.

<text>A crossbreed is an organism with purebred parents of two different breeds, varieties, or populations. A domestic animal of unknown ancestry, where the breed status of only one parent or grandparent is known, may also be called a crossbreed though the term &quot;mixed breed&quot; is technically more accurate. Outcrossing is a type of crossbreeding used within a purebred breed to increase the genetic diversity within the breed, particularly when there is a need to avoid inbreeding.

In animal breeding, &quot;crossbreeds&quot; are crosses within a single species, while &quot;hybrids&quot; are crosses between different species. In plant breeding terminology, the term &quot;crossbreed&quot; is uncommon, and no universal term is used to distinguish hybridization or crossing within a population from those between populations, or even those between species.

Crossbreeding is the process of breeding such an organism. It can be beneficially used to maintain health and viability of organisms. However, irresponsible crossbreeding can also produce organisms of inferior quality or dilute a purebred gene pool to the point of extinction of a given breed of organism.

== Crossbreeds in specific animals ==

Cats: The many newly developed and recognized breeds of domestic cat are crossbreeds between existing, well-established breeds (sometimes with limited hybridization with some wild species), to either combine selected traits from the foundation stock, or propagate a rare mutation without excessive inbreeding. However, some nascent breeds such as the Aegean cat are developed entirely from a local landrace population. Most experimental cat breeds are crossbreeds.

Cattle: In cattle, there are systems of crossbreeding. In many crossbreeds, one animal is larger than the other. One is used when the purebred females are particularly adapted to a specific environment, and are crossed with purebred bulls from another environment to produce a generation having traits of both parents.

Sheep: The large number of breeds of sheep, which vary greatly, creates an opportunity for crossbreeding to be used to tailor production of lambs to the goal of the individual stockman.

Llamas: Results of crossbreeding classic and woolly breeds of llama are unpredictable. The resulting offspring displays physical characteristics of either parent, or a mix of characteristics from both, periodically producing a fleeced llama. 
The results are increasingly unpredictable when both parents are crossbreeds, with possibility of the offspring displaying characteristics of a grandparent, not obvious in either parent.

Dogs:

A &quot;crossbred&quot; dog is a cross between two (sometimes more) known breeds, and is usually distinguished from a &quot;mixed-breed dog&quot;, which has ancestry from many sources, some of which may not be known. Crossbreeds are popular, due to the belief that they have increased vigor without loss of attractiveness of the dog. Certain planned crossbreeding between purebred dogs of different breeds are now widely known as &quot;designer dogs&quot; and can produce puppies worth more than their purebred parents, due to a high demand.
Horses:
Crossbreeding horses is often done with the intent of ultimately creating a new breed of horse. One type of modern crossbreeding in horses created many of the warmblood breeds used in the sport horse disciplines, usually registered in an open stud book by a studbook selection procedure that evaluates conformation, pedigree and, in some animals, a training or performance standard. Most warmblood breeds began as a cross of draft horse breeds on Thoroughbreds, but have, in some cases, developed over the past century to the point where they are considered to be a true-breeding population and have a closed stud book. Other types of recognized crossbreeding include that within the American Quarter Horse, which will register horses with one Thoroughbred parent and one registered Quarter Horse parent in the &quot;Appendix&quot; registry, and allow such animals full breed registration status as Quarter Horses if they meet a certain performance standard. Another well-known crossbred horse is the Anglo-Arabian, which may be produced by a purebred Arabian horse crossed on a Thoroughbred, or by various crosses of Anglo-Arabians with other Anglo-Arabians, as long as the ensuing animal never has more than 75% or less than 25% of each breed represented in its pedigree.

== Hybrid animals ==

A hybrid animal is one with parentage of two separate species, differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species. Hybrids are usually, but not always, sterile.

One of the most ancient types of hybrid animal is the mule, a cross between a female horse and a male donkey. The liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion and female tiger. The yattle is a cross between a cow and a yak. Other crosses include the tigon (between a male tiger and female lion) and yakalo (between a yak and an American bison). The Incas recognized that hybrids of &quot;Lama glama&quot; (llama) and &quot;Vicugna pacos&quot; (alpaca) resulted in a hybrid with none of the advantages of either parent.

At one time it was thought that dogs and wolves were separate species, and the crosses between dogs and wolves were called wolf hybrids. Today wolves and dogs are both recognized as &quot;Canis lupus&quot;, but the old term &quot;wolf hybrid&quot; is still used.

== Mixed breeds ==

A mixed-breed animal is defined as having undocumented or unknown parentage, while a crossbreed generally has known, usually purebred parents of two distinct breeds or varieties. A dog of unknown parentage is often called a mixed-breed dog, &quot;mutt&quot; or &quot;mongrel.&quot; A cat of unknown parentage is often referred to as a domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cat generically, and in some dialects is often called a &quot;moggie&quot;. A horse of unknown bloodlines is called a grade horse.

== Designer crossbreed ==

A designer crossbreed or designer breed is a crossbred animal with purebred parents, usually registered with a breed registry, but from two different breeds. These animals are the result of a deliberate decision to create a specific crossbred animal. Less often, the animal may have more than two pure breeds in its ancestry, but unlike a mutt or a mongrel, its entire pedigree is known to descend from specific known animals. While the term is best known when applied to certain dog crossbreeds, other animals such as cattle, horses, birds and cats may also be bred in this fashion. Some crossbred breeders start a freestanding breed registry to record designer crossbreds, other crossbreds may be included in an &quot;appendix&quot; to an existing purebred registry. either form of registration may be the first step in recording and tracking pedigrees in order to develop a new breed.

The purpose of creating designer crossbreds is usually one or more of the following reasons:

# to breed animals with heterosis, commonly known as &quot;hybrid vigor&quot;,
# to create animals with more predictable characteristics than mixed breed or mongrel breeding,
# to avoid certain undesirable recessive traits that lead to genetic diseases that plague many purebred animals,
# to develop an animal that combines what are viewed as the best traits of two or more breeds,
# as the preliminary steps toward developing a new animal breed.

Breeders of designer crossbreds borrow the technical language from hybrid plant breeding: A first generation, 50–50 crossbred is an F1 cross. Subsequent generations may see a purebred animal crossed back on a crossbred, creating a 75/25 cross, or a BC1 or F1b &quot;backcross.&quot; The breeding of two crossbreeds of the same combination of breeds, creating an F2 cross, an animal that is still a 50–50 cross, but it is the second filial generation of the combination. An F2 cross bred to an F2 cross creates an F3 cross. Similarly, an F2 animal bred to an F1 animal creates an F2b backcross. F3 crosses and greater are called &quot;multi-generational&quot; crosses. In dog breeding, three generations of reliable documented breeding can be considered a &quot;breed&quot; rather than a crossbreed.

There are disadvantages to creating designer crossbreeds, notably the potential that the cross will be of inferior quality or that it will not produce as consistent a result as would breeding purebred animals. For example, the Poodle is a frequent breed used in creation of designer crossbreeds, due to its non-shedding coat, but that trait does not always breed true when it is part of a designer cross. Also, because breeders of crossbred animals may be less careful about genetic testing and weeding out undesirable traits, certain deleterious dominant genes may still be passed on to a crossbreed offspring. In an F2 cross, recessive genetic traits may also return if the parent animals were both carriers of an undesired trait.

<text>The Trans-Labrador Highway (TLH) is the primary public road in Labrador, the mainland portion of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The highway&#x27;s total length is . The paving of the entire highway was completed in July 2022.

The original western/central portion of the TLH is designated as Route 500 and measures divided as follows:
* Quebec - Labrador boundary to Labrador City/Wabush (, asphalt surface)
* Labrador City/Wabush to Churchill Falls (, asphalt surface)
* Churchill Falls to Happy Valley-Goose Bay (, asphalt surface)

Heading southeast is Route 510, the north portion of the TLH that has been designated Labrador Coastal Drive and measures divided as follows:

* Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Cartwright Junction ( asphalt, gravel, the remainder was paved in 2022
* Cartwright Junction to Port Hope Simpson (, asphalt surface)
* Port Hope Simpson to Mary&#x27;s Harbour (, asphalt surface)
* Mary&#x27;s Harbour to Lodge Bay (, asphalt surface)
* Lodge Bay to Red Bay (, asphalt surface)
* Red Bay to Quebec - Labrador boundary via Blanc-Sablon (, asphalt surface)

The TLH runs through dense wilderness for most of its length with no roadside services between communities. 
Route 500 connects with Quebec Route 389, which runs through wilderness north from Baie-Comeau to the Quebec - Labrador boundary. Cell phone reception along the Trans-Labrador Highway is limited.

In the 2020 budget, the provincial government allocated $200,000 for a pre-feasibility study for a road to connect the north coast of Labrador to the Trans-Labrador Highway.

==Construction and development==
===Phase I, upgrading Labrador West to Happy Valley-Goose Bay===

The original TLH from Labrador West (Labrador City/Wabush) to Happy Valley-Goose Bay was completed in 1992. Some sections were poorly built or in need of upgrades due to increased traffic use, particularly the section between Churchill Falls and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. In the summer of 1999, $60 million was allocated to upgrade the highway as part of the &quot;Labrador Transportation Initiative&quot;.

The Phase I section of the TLH began undergoing paving operations in 2009; by October 2011, a stretch of approximately leading east from Labrador West had been paved, as well approximately heading west from Goose Bay towards Churchill Falls. The entire Phase I section of the TLH was completed in 2015.

====Route 510====

In 1997, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador committed to building an extension of the TLH, connecting Happy Valley-Goose Bay with an existing isolated road network serving coastal communities on the Strait of Belle Isle. The impetus for this project was the federal government&#x27;s desire to cut costs and remove itself from subsidizing coastal ferry service to Labrador outports which was being provided by the federal Crown corporation Marine Atlantic.

These federal cuts were completed in 1997, under the moniker Labrador Transportation Initiative, when an agreement was signed which saw the federal government transfer ownership and operation of two ferry vessels, along with C$340 million for extending Labrador&#x27;s road network. A key component to this plan was $150 million to upgrade coastal Labrador marine services, including a newer high-capacity ferry for the St. Barbe-Blanc Sablon service across the Strait of Belle Isle.
===Phase II, Red Bay to Cartwright Junction===

Phase II of new construction, costing $130 million, began in 1999 and saw Route 510 extended over four years from its terminus in Red Bay northeast to the port of Cartwright. This section was paved as far as Cartwright Junction, the unpaved remainder (to Cartwright) being designated Highway 516.

===Phase III, Cartwright Junction to Happy Valley-Goose Bay===

Phase III is a section of Route 510 built for $130 million south of Lake Melville/Hamilton Inlet to connect Cartwright Junction ( south west of Cartwright) with Happy Valley-Goose Bay, completed sufficiently to open to traffic as a gravel road on 16 December 2009. During 2010, two permanent bridges, road surface work, signage, and guardrails were completed at a cost of $15 million. The road was then paved except for from Cartwright Junction westward to Paradise Heights (the divide between the basins of the Paradise River and the Eagle River). The remainder was completed in July 2022.

==Route 516 and supplementary routes==

Phase II involved completion of highway north to Cartwright from Red Bay, and was opened in 2002. Although the entire route was initially designated as Route 510, upon completion of Phase III, the northern from Cartwright Junction (to Cartwright) was designated as Route 516.

Phase II also included other branch routes:

* Route 513 to St. Lewis
* Route 514 to Charlottetown and Pinsent Arm

A segment of Quebec Route 138 extends from Old Fort, Quebec to the Newfoundland and Labrador border connecting with Route 510 near Blanc-Sablon on the eastern end of the Côte-Nord. A gap remains between Kegashka and Old Fort, through isolated communities accessible only by coastal ferry. On August 25, 2006, the Quebec government announced a 10-year project to connect the two segments by building 425 km of highway along the Lower North Shore. As of 2022, the highway has not been completed.

<text>Patrick Leonard Sajak ( ; né , born October 26, 1946) is an American game show host, television personality, and creative consultant. He is best known as the host of the television game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, a position which he held from 1981 to 2024. Sajak currently serves as a consultant for the show. He remains as host of &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot;. For his work on &quot;Wheel&quot;, Sajak has received 19 nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host, winning thrice, and twice nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Game Show, winning in 2024. In 2019, he was recognized by Guinness World Records for having the longest-serving career as a game show host for the same show, surpassing previous record holder Bob Barker.

Beyond his game show career, Sajak has made various appearances in films, television series, and game shows, such as &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and &quot;Rugrats&quot;. He also hosted a late-night talk show on CBS from 1989 to 1990 and became a frequent guest host for CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and the syndicated &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;.

Sajak has been involved in a variety of other endeavors, including as an external director of conservative publishing house Eagle Publishing and writing for the National Review Online and Ricochet.co. He is also the author of several puzzle games, including &quot;Lucky Letters&quot;, developed in collaboration with puzzle developer David L. Hoyt.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 26, 1946, Sajak graduated from Farragut High School in 1964, then went to Columbia College Chicago while working as a desk clerk at The Palmer House Hilton hotel. His Polish-origin surname was originally spelled Sajdak, but he later changed it to Sajak to better reflect its Americanized pronunciation.

Sajak served in the U.S. Army as a disc jockey during the Vietnam War for American Forces Vietnam Network. He hosted the same &quot;Dawn Buster&quot; radio show that Adrian Cronauer did and Sajak followed Cronauer&#x27;s tradition of signing on with &quot;Good Morning Vietnam!&quot; for 14 months.

==Career==
Sajak won a contest on WLS radio&#x27;s &quot;Dick Biondi Show&quot; to be a guest teen deejay. While at Columbia College Chicago, his broadcasting instructor Al Parker told him that a local radio station (WEDC) was looking for a newsman. Sajak applied for the job and was hired to work from midnight to 6:00 a.m. In 1968, he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to Vietnam, serving as a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio. On the Military Channel&#x27;s program, &quot;An Officer and a Movie&quot;, Sajak admitted to botching President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1969 Christmas broadcast to the troops; he accidentally cut the feed off prematurely. Upon realizing the error, Sajak decided it would be best not to resume the feed. In the early 1970s, he DJed for a year at WNBS in Murray, Kentucky. Also in the early 1970s, Sajak began DJing at 50,000-watt WSM in Nashville; at the time, WSM was playing pop music during the day, and he was the 2:30–5:00 pm afternoon personality. The radio station&#x27;s television sister, WSM-TV (now WSMV), brought Sajak on screen, first as a voiceover artist making station identifications and anchoring the five-minute newscasts during NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, then as a weekend and substitute weatherman, where he became acquainted with anchor Dan Miller. In 1977, KNBC-TV in Los Angeles was looking for a weather reporter and spotted Sajak working in Nashville. He accepted KNBC&#x27;s request for him to be a full-time weather reporter for the station.

In 1981, Merv Griffin asked Sajak if he would be interested in taking over the duties as host on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; from Chuck Woolery. However, Fred Silverman, the president and CEO of NBC, rejected his hiring, claiming Sajak was too local, and Griffin responded by imposing a moratorium on new tapings until Sajak was hired. The issue became moot when Silverman was dismissed due to repeated programming failures and replaced by Brandon Tartikoff. Sajak, who had already hosted two game show pilots in 1980, &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; for Ralph Edwards (no relation to the 1983 CBS game show of the same name) and &quot;Puzzlers&quot; for Mark Goodson, accepted the position. From 1983 to 1989, Sajak hosted both the daytime (NBC) and syndicated evening versions of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;; Sajak continued to host the latter version until 2024. With Sajak returning for his 36th season in 2018–19, he became the longest-running host of any game show, surpassing Bob Barker, who hosted &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; from 1972 to 2007. Sajak was officially honored as such by the Guinness World Records with the episode taped on March 28, 2019, and aired May 8, 2019 (two days before the primetime version&#x27;s 7,000th episode).
Sajak had a small role as a Buffalo, New York newscaster in the 1982 comedy film &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel.&quot; When his late-night talk show on CBS premiered in January 1989, Sajak left the daytime version of &quot;Wheel&quot; and was replaced by former San Diego Chargers place-kicker Rolf Benirschke (who was later replaced by Bob Goen when the daytime show moved to CBS in July of that year). Sajak appeared on &quot;Super Password&quot; several times from 1984 to 1989, as well as &quot;Password Plus&quot; in 1981, shortly before taking on hosting duties on &quot;Wheel&quot;. Other game shows on which he appeared as a celebrity guest were &quot;Dream House&quot;, &quot;Just Men!&quot;, and &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;.

Sajak hosted a short-lived late-night talk show on CBS from January 9, 1989 to April 13, 1990. Dan Miller, Sajak&#x27;s old friend and former anchor at WSM-TV in Nashville, joined him as his sidekick. Sajak later became a frequent guest host for CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; when King was unable to do the show. Sajak became a regular substitute host for Regis Philbin on the syndicated &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. Sajak also hosted &quot;Pat Sajak Weekend&quot; on Fox News in 2003. From at least 2002, Sajak hosted &quot;The Pat Sajak Baseball Hour&quot;, a syndicated weekly radio sports talk show that ended in 2006 due to scheduling conflicts.

Sajak is an external director of conservative publishing house Eagle Publishing. He has been a member of the board of directors for the Claremont Institute.

In 1983, Sajak portrayed Kevin Hathaway in the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot; In 1994, Sajak appeared as himself on the children&#x27;s cartoon show &quot;Rugrats.&quot;
In 1997, Sajak pulled an April Fool&#x27;s Day prank on fans when he and Vanna White were contestants on an episode of &quot;Wheel&quot; hosted by Alex Trebek. The winnings of both Sajak and White were donated to charity (in this case, the American Cancer Society and the Boy Scouts of America). In return, Sajak hosted a regular episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in place of Trebek. Sajak also appeared at the beginning of a 2010 April Fool&#x27;s episode, along with Jeff Probst and Neil Patrick Harris.

In 2001, Sajak appeared as himself in the episode &quot;Inner Tube&quot; on the sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;.

Sajak began writing for the &quot;National Review Online&quot; in 2010. In his first post, Sajak questioned whether public employees should be allowed to vote on issues that would benefit them directly. He also has contributed to the center-right sociopolitical/social networking website Ricochet.com.

Sajak is the author of several puzzle games, the first and best-known of them being &quot;Lucky Letters&quot;, which debuted in 2007. The games, which Sajak developed with puzzle developer David L. Hoyt, are syndicated through Universal Uclick.

As of 2019, Sajak is the Hillsdale College board of trustees chair. He was previously vice-chair for 15 years. Hillsdale is a private Christian college.

Sajak has appeared on episodes of ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz&quot;, as well as Le Batard&#x27;s other show, &quot;Highly Questionable&quot;.

Since 2020, Sajak has been credited as a Consulting Producer (since the start of Season 39) of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

Since 2021, Sajak and White have hosted Primetime &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot; on ABC.

In September 2021, it was announced that both Sajak and White had signed on to continue as hosts of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; through the 2023–24 season. In 2021, Sajak voiced a singing bust in a &quot;Muppets Haunted Mansion&quot; television special. Sajak has been a frequent celebrity narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional, appearing most recently in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021.

On June 12, 2023, Sajak announced that he would retire as host of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in 2024, after the conclusion of the show&#x27;s 41st season. Shortly afterwards, media personality Ryan Seacrest was announced as Sajak&#x27;s successor. His final episode was taped in April 2024 and aired on June 7, 2024. In June 2023, Sajak agreed to continue as a show consultant for three years after hosting and said he would continue as chairman of the board of trustees for Hillsdale College. It was announced on July 11, 2024 that Sajak will remain the host of &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

==In popular culture==

While at WSMV as a meteorologist in the mid-1970s, Sajak commented about &quot;daytime highs and nighttime lows&quot;. This prompted songwriter Ben Peters to write &quot;Daytime Friends&quot;, which became a number one hit for Kenny Rogers in 1977.

Sajak was parodied in a 1980s &quot;Sesame Street&quot; sketch, with a Muppet named Pat Playjacks hosting &quot;Squeal of Fortune&quot;. The goal was for the contestants (Prairie Dawn and The Count) to guess how many times a pig in the center of the wheel would squeal before the wheel stopped.

During the 1980s, comedian Martin Short frequently portrayed a fictional character he called Ed Grimley, a hyperactive manchild who is obsessed with banal popular culture – Sajak in particular – on the sketch comedy television shows &quot;SCTV&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In 1986, Sajak and his &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; co-star Vanna White portrayed themselves on an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;227&quot;.

In the fourth-season episode of &quot;The A-Team&quot; called &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, Sajak makes a cameo along with co-star Vanna White. In the episode, Murdock wins big at &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; due to Face&#x27;s system of guessing the letters correctly.

In 1992, Sajak was a special guest star in the TV show &quot;The Commish&quot;. The episode first aired on November 7, 1992, and was called &quot;The Two Faces of Ed&quot;. He played psychologist Brian Brandon.

In the fourth episode of season three of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Brickleberry&quot;, &quot;That Brother&#x27;s My Father&quot;, Sajak gets kidnapped and becomes a hostage to the wheel of fortune. In the episode, the character of Connie, a strong and very large but typically kindhearted state park ranger, takes an unhealthy obsession with Sajak and his famous game show, ultimately tying him to a makeshift replica of the wheel itself and attempting a faux-game of Wheel of Fortune with him while behaving erratically.

In the fourth episode of season four of &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot;, Jacob Hill, a teacher at Abbott Elementary, dresses up as Pat Sajak for Halloween.

==Personal life==
Sajak is married to Lesly Brown-Sajak, a photographer, with whom he has two children: a son, Patrick Michael James Sajak (born September 22, 1990), who is a doctor, having earned his medical degree in 2021, and a daughter, Maggie Marie Sajak (born January 5, 1995), who is a social correspondent on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. They live in Severna Park, Maryland, with a second home in Los Angeles.

Sajak is featured as a narrator in a brief film shown at the visitor center at Mount Vernon, the residence of George Washington, where he explains to tourists the attractions of the site. From 1998 until the end of 2021, Sajak owned Maryland-based AM radio station WNAV in Annapolis.

===Politics===
Sajak is a Republican, and has written a number of columns for the conservative magazine &quot;Human Events&quot;. He is also a regular poster and podcast participant on the conservative blog Ricochet.com. Sajak rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He is also a financial supporter of the Young America&#x27;s Foundation, which sponsors conservative speakers on college campuses. Sajak noted in his last appearance as host of the game show that he did not include politics into his hosting duties, saying that the show included &quot;no social issues, no politics&quot; and was &quot;just a game.&quot;

===Sports===
In 2005, Sajak became an investor in the Golden Baseball League, an independent professional baseball league with teams in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Alberta, British Columbia, and Baja California. During a guest appearance in the broadcast booth at a March 2012 Baltimore Orioles – Boston Red Sox spring-training game, Sajak acknowledged that he had called some baseball games in the past.

Sajak is an avid fan of the Washington Capitals NHL team. He is a longtime season-ticket holder and made an on-ice appearance before game three of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals.

===Health===
Sajak underwent emergency intestinal surgery to remove a blockage on November 8, 2019. While Sajak recovered, co-host Vanna White hosted in his place. The first taping day in which he was incapacitated was a Disney-themed Christmas episode week. Disney characters took over White&#x27;s role at the puzzle board for that week. Sajak&#x27;s daughter, Maggie, also helped White for a week. Sajak returned to work on December 5, 2019.

<text>Raphael Louis Zengel (11 November 189427 February 1977) was an American-born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Zengel was born at Faribault, Minnesota. As a young boy, he and his mother Mary moved to a homestead near the village of Plunkett, Saskatchewan. He enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in July 1915.

==Victoria Cross==
Zengel received the Military Medal in March 1918 for taking command of his platoon when his officer and sergeant had been put out of action. He was 23 years old, and a sergeant of the 5th (Western Cavalry) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War, when on 9 August 1918 east of Warvillers, France, he performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The citation reads:
==Retirement==

After the war, Zengel lived in Calgary, Alberta, where he joined the Calgary Fire Department in 1919 and served until 1927.

Sergeant Zengel spent most of the rest of his life in the town Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, where the local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion has been named in his honour. He donated his Victoria Cross to the Rocky Mountain House Legion, where a replica of his Victoria Cross along with the rest of his medals are on display. His headstone can be found at Pine Grove Cemetery, Rocky Mountain House, Canada. 
==Legacy==
In 1936, the government of Canada chose to name a lake in northeastern Saskatchewan in Zengel&#x27;s honour. Inexplicably, the feature became Zengle Lake, and so it remains today (2007). In 1951, one of the mountains of the Victoria Cross Range, in Jasper National Park, was named in his honour. Mount Zengel is visible from Highway 16, east of Jasper, Alberta.

<text>Handball at the 2004 Summer Olympics included a men&#x27;s and a women&#x27;s team competitions with the preliminary rounds taking place in the Sports Pavilion at the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex. From the quarter final stage onwards, the women&#x27;s event moved to the Helliniko Olympic Indoor Arena, a part of the Helliniko Olympic Complex, with the men joining them there for their semi-finals and final.

The men&#x27;s Handball event first made an appearance, played outside, at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany but did not then re-appear until the Games returned to Germany for the Munich Olympics in 1972 since when it has been ever present. The women&#x27;s game debuted in Montreal, Quebec, Canada at the 1976 Summer Olympics and again has been ever present since.

<text>The 1991–92 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers primetime hours from September 1991 through August 1992. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1990–91 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New series are highlighted in bold. Series ending their original runs are highlighted in &quot;italics&quot;.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. From February 8 to 24, 1992, all of CBS&#x27; primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, and from July 25 to August 9, 1992, all of NBC&#x27;s primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

<text>Henry Mareus &quot;Harcus&quot; Strachan (; 7 November 1884 – 1 May 1982) was a Scottish born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Strachan was born in Bo&#x27;ness, Scotland and attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh before emigrating to Canada in 1905. He homesteaded a farm in the Chauvin district, near Wainwright, Alberta. Prior to winning the VC, Strachan was initiated into freemasonry in his birthplace, at the Douglas Lodge 409 Bo&#x27;ness, on 22 January 1917.

==World War I==
Strachan joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in July 1915.

Strachan was 33 years of age, and serving in the First World War with the Canadian Cavalry Brigade as a lieutenant in The Fort Garry Horse, when he performed the action for which he was awarded the VC. It has become traditional for the Garrys to hold a Regimental dinner every year on the anniversary of Strachan&#x27;s unlikely cavalry exploit.

The action occurred during the Battle of Cambrai. It occurred on 20 November 1917 at Masnières, France, after Lieutenant Strachan took command of the mounted squadron of Garrys when his commanding officer, &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron leader Captain Campbell, was killed by machine gun fire.

Believing that the 29th Division with tanks already held the village of Masnieres, Brig. Gen. Nelson of the 88th Brigade, ordered the Fort Garry Horse to advance across the St Quentin Canal. On approaching the river bridge in front of Masnieres, the Garrys could see that the town was still held by the enemy and that the bridge across the St Quentin Canal was broken. The Garrys then found the Hampshire Regiment were crossing, in single file, over the lock gates. Tearing up a wooden pier, they built a bridge suitable for horses to cross. By 4pm &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron set out through a gap in the enemy wire, and approached the German front line at a gallop. B Squadron leader Capt. Campbell was killed, and Strachan took command, leading &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron at the gallop across the countryside toward Rumilly.

Due to the state of the crossing at Masnieres and the limited available daylight Major-Gen W. H. Greenly commanding 2nd Cavalry Division, ordered any large-scale cavalry action to halt and ordered the recall of the units that had crossed the Canal. Neither Lt. Col. RW Patterson, commanding the Fort Garry Horse nor mounted orderlies, could find &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron who were south-east of Rumilly to give them the recall order.

B Squadron led by Strachan, cut its way through a line of infantry in a heavily camouflaged road and found a four-gunned German field battery in front of them. They charged, and rode down or sabred the gunners. German infantry positioned beyond the guns fired on them and again Strachan led a charge, They broke the infantry but were under fire, taking more casualties as they rode towards Rumilly. Now with less than fifty men and only five unwounded horses, they sheltered in a sunken road 1,200 yards east of the town. Strachan realised there was to be no support, so he had the horses cut loose and he led the unit in a withdrawal towards the Canal. During this fighting withdrawal, B Squadron scattered four bodies of German troops.

In short, Lieutenant Strachan led the squadron through the enemy line of machine-gun posts and then, with the surviving men, led the charge on the German battery, killing seven of the gunners with his sword. When all the gunners were killed and the battery silenced, he rallied his men and fought his way back at night on foot through the enemy&#x27;s lines, bringing all unwounded men safely in, together with 15 prisoners.

His citation reads:
Strachan, having been promoted to captain, received his VC from King George V on 6 January 1918.

==Later life==
After the war, he returned to his farm in the Chauvin district, Alberta 

He ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1921 Alberta provincial election, in the Wainwright constituency, but was not elected, a victim of the Farmers&#x27; sweep.

He went into banking. By 1930, he had moved to Calgary. In the 1930s he married Betsy Stirling and they had a daughter Jean.
Strachan later commanded the 1st Battalion, Edmonton Fusiliers during the Second World War. After the war he retired and moved to Vancouver. Strachan eventually attained the rank of lieutenant colonel.

In 1967 he voiced his disdain for the U.S. proponents of the U.S.-Vietnam War.

Strachan died on 1 May 1982, at the age of 97 years and 175 days, the record longest-lived recipient of the Victoria Cross. Strachan&#x27;s ashes were scattered near the Rose Garden Columbarium at Boal Chapel Memorial Gardens in North Vancouver, BC on 5 May.

In September 2013 a lake in Manitoba was named &quot;Harcus Strachan Lake&quot; to commemorate his award of the Victoria Cross. (Winnipeg Free Press, 15 January 2014).

On 20 November 2018, the McGregor Armoury in Winnipeg, home of the Fort Garry Horse, was renamed in honour of Harcus Strachan VC MC.

<doc id="825514" wikidata="Q1151641" url="?curid=825514" title="Halomethane">
<text>Halomethane compounds are derivatives of methane () with one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced with halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, or I). Halomethanes are both naturally occurring, especially in marine environments, and human-made, most notably as refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and fumigants. Many, including the chlorofluorocarbons, have attracted wide attention because they become active when exposed to ultraviolet light found at high altitudes and destroy the Earth&#x27;s protective ozone layer.

==Structure and properties==
Like methane itself, halomethanes are tetrahedral molecules. The halogen atoms differ greatly in size and charge from hydrogen and from each other. Consequently, most halomethanes deviate from the perfect tetrahedral symmetry of methane.

The physical properties of halomethanes depend on the number and identity of the halogen atoms in the compound. In general, halomethanes are volatile but less so than methane because of the polarizability of the halides. The polarizability of the halides and the polarity of the molecules makes them useful as solvents. The halomethanes are far less flammable than methane. Broadly speaking, reactivity of the compounds is greatest for the iodides and lowest for the fluorides.

==Production==

===Industrial routes===
The halomethanes are produced on an industrial scale from abundant precursors such as natural gas or methanol, and from halogens or halides. They are usually prepared by one of three methods.
*Free radical chlorination of methane (under ultraviolet light):
This method is useful for the production of (&quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, or 4). The main problems with this method are that it cogenerates HCl and it produces mixtures of different products. Using in large excess generates primarily and using in large excess generates primarily , but mixtures of other products will still be present.
*Halogenation of methanol. This method is used for the production of the mono-chloride, -bromide, and -iodide.
:
*Halogen exchange. The method is mainly used to produce fluorinated derivatives from the chlorides.
:
:
:
:
:
:
:
:
*Reaction of methane with hypochlorous acid, producing water.
*Reaction of methanol with hypochlorous acid, producing hydrogen peroxide.

Traces of halomethanes in the atmosphere arise through the introduction of other non-natural, industrial materials.

===In nature===
Many marine organisms biosynthesize halomethanes, especially bromine-containing compounds. Small amounts of chloromethanes arise from the interaction of chlorine sources with various carbon compounds. The biosyntheses of these halomethanes are catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase enzymes, respectively. An idealized equation is:

==Classes of compounds==
Halons are usually defined as hydrocarbons where the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by bromine, along with other halogens. They are referred to by a system of code numbers similar to (but simpler than) the system used for freons. The first digit specifies the number of carbon atoms in the molecule, the second is the number of fluorine atoms, the third is the chlorine atoms, and the fourth is the number of bromine atoms. If the number includes a fifth digit, the fifth number indicates the number of iodine atoms (though iodine in halon is rare). Any bonds not taken up by halogen atoms are then allocated to hydrogen atoms.

For example, consider Halon 1211. This halon has number 1211 in its name, which tells it has 1 carbon atom, 2 fluorine atoms, 1 chlorine atom, and 1 bromine atom. A single carbon only has four bonds, all of which are taken by the halogen atoms, so there is no hydrogen. Thus its formula is , hence its IUPAC name is bromochlorodifluoromethane.

===ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34-1992===
The refrigerant naming system is mainly used for fluorinated and chlorinated short alkanes used as refrigerants. In the United States, the standard is specified in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34–1992, with additional annual supplements. The specified ANSI/ASHRAE prefixes were FC (fluorocarbon) or R (refrigerant), but today most are prefixed by a more specific classification:
*CFC—list of chlorofluorocarbons
*HCFC—list of hydrochlorofluorocarbons
*HFC—list of hydrofluorocarbons
*FC—list of fluorocarbons
*PFC—list of perfluorocarbons (completely fluorinated)

The decoding system for CFC-01234a is:

*0 = Number of double bonds (omitted if zero)
*1 = Carbon atoms -1 (omitted if zero)
*2 = Hydrogen atoms +1
*3 = Fluorine atoms
*4 = Replaced by Bromine (&quot;B&quot; prefix added)
*a = Letter added to identify isomers, the &quot;normal&quot; isomer in any number has the smallest mass difference on each carbon, and a, b, or c are added as the masses diverge from normal.

Other coding systems are in use as well.

===Hydrofluoro compounds (HFC) ===

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) contain no chlorine. They are composed entirely of carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine. They have no known effects on the ozone layer; fluorine itself is not ozone-toxic. However, HFCs and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are greenhouse gases, which cause global warming. Two groups of haloalkanes, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons, are targets of the Kyoto Protocol. Allan Thornton, President of the Environmental Investigation Agency, a non-governmental, environmental watchdog, says that HFCs are up to 12,500 times as potent as carbon dioxide in global warming. The higher global warming potential has two causes: HFCs remain in the atmosphere for long periods of time, and they have more chemical bonds than , which means that they are able to absorb more solar energy per molecule than carbon dioxide. Wealthy countries are clamping down on these gases. Thornton says that many countries are needlessly producing these chemicals just to get the carbon credits. Thus, as a result of carbon trading rules under the Kyoto Protocol, nearly half the credits from developing countries are from HFCs, with China scoring billions of dollars from catching and destroying HFCs that would be in the atmosphere as industrial byproducts.

===Overview of principal halomethanes===
Most permutations of hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine on one carbon atom have been evaluated experimentally.
==Applications==
Because they have many applications and are easily prepared, halomethanes have been of intense commercial interest.

===Solvents===
Dichloromethane is the most important halomethane-based solvent. Its volatility, low flammability, and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes this colorless liquid a useful solvent. It is widely used as a paint stripper and a degreaser. In the food industry, it was previously used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavorings. Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams.

===Propellants===
One major use of CFCs has been as propellants of aerosols, including metered-dose inhalers for drugs used to treat asthma. The conversion of these devices and treatments from CFC to propellants that do not deplete the ozone layer is almost complete. Production and import is now banned in the United States.

===Fire extinguishing===
At high temperatures, halons decompose to release halogen atoms that combine readily with active hydrogen atoms, quenching flame propagation reactions even when adequate fuel, oxygen, and heat remain. The chemical reaction in a flame proceeds as a free radical chain reaction; by sequestering the radicals which propagate the reaction, halons are able to halt the fire at much lower concentrations than are required by fire suppressants using the more traditional methods of cooling, oxygen deprivation, or fuel dilution. , due to ozone depletion problems, halon fire extinguishers are largely banned in some countries and alternatives are being deployed by the US military.

Halon 1301 total flooding systems are typically used at concentrations no higher than 7% by volume in air, and can suppress many fires at 2.9% v/v. By contrast, carbon dioxide fire suppression flood systems operate from 34% concentration by volume (surface-only combustion of liquid fuels) up to 75% (dust traps). Carbon dioxide can cause severe distress at concentrations of 3–6%, and has caused death by respiratory paralysis in a few minutes at 10% concentration. Halon 1301 causes only slight giddiness at its effective concentration of 5%, and even at 15% those exposed remain conscious but impaired and suffer no long-term effects. (Experimental animals have also been exposed to 2% concentrations of Halon 1301 for 30 hours per week for 4 months, with no discernible health effects.) Halon 1211 also has low toxicity, although it is more toxic than Halon 1301, and thus considered unsuitable for flooding systems.

However, Halon 1301 fire suppression is not completely non-toxic; very high temperature flame, or contact with red-hot metal, can cause decomposition of Halon 1301 to toxic byproducts. The presence of such byproducts is readily detected because they include hydrobromic acid and hydrofluoric acid, which are intensely irritating. Halons are very effective on Class A (organic solids), B (flammable liquids and gases), and C (electrical) fires, but they are unsuitable for Class D (metal) fires, as they will not only produce toxic gas and fail to halt the fire, but in some cases pose a risk of explosion. Halons can be used on Class K (kitchen oils and greases) fires, but offer no advantages over specialised foams.

Halon 1301 is common in total flooding systems. In these systems, banks of halon cylinders are kept pressurised to about 4 MPa (600 psi) with compressed nitrogen, and a fixed piping network leads to the protected enclosure. On triggering, the entire measured contents of one or more cylinders are discharged into the enclosure in a few seconds, through nozzles designed to ensure uniform mixing throughout the room. The quantity dumped is pre-calculated to achieve the desired concentration, typically 3–7% v/v. This level is maintained for some time, typically with a minimum of ten minutes and sometimes up to a twenty-minute &quot;soak&quot; time, to ensure all items have cooled so reignition is unlikely to occur, then the air in the enclosure is purged, generally via a fixed purge system that is activated by the proper authorities. During this time the enclosure may be entered by persons wearing SCBA. (There exists a common myth that this is because halon is highly toxic; in fact, it is because it can cause giddiness and mildly impaired perception, and due to the risk of combustion byproducts.)
Flooding systems may be manually operated or automatically triggered by a VESDA or other automatic detection system. In the latter case, a warning siren and strobe lamp will first be activated for a few seconds to warn personnel to evacuate the area. The rapid discharge of halon and consequent rapid cooling fills the air with fog, and is accompanied by a loud, disorienting noise.

Halon 1301 is also used in the inerting system of the F-16 fighter to prevent the fuel vapors in the fuel tanks from becoming explosive; when the aircraft enters an area with the possibility of attack, Halon 1301 is injected into the fuel tanks for one-time use. Due to ozone depletion, trifluoroiodomethane () is being considered as an alternative.

Halon 1211 is typically used in hand-held extinguishers, in which a stream of liquid halon is directed at a smaller fire by a user. The stream evaporates under reduced pressure, producing strong local cooling, as well as a high concentration of halon in the immediate vicinity of the fire. In this mode, fire is extinguished by cooling and oxygen deprivation at the core of the fire, as well as radical quenching over a larger area. After fire suppression, the halon diffuses, leaving no residue.

===Chemical building blocks===
Chloromethane and bromomethane are used to introduce methyl groups in organic synthesis. Chlorodifluoromethane is the main precursor of tetrafluoroethylene, which is the monomeric precursor to Teflon.

==Safety==
Haloalkanes are diverse in their properties, making generalizations difficult. Few are acutely toxic, but many pose risks from prolonged exposure. Some problematic aspects include carcinogenicity and liver damage (e.g., carbon tetrachloride). Under certain combustion conditions, chloromethanes convert to phosgene, which is highly toxic.

<text>Lake Melville is an estuary of Hamilton Inlet (itself an extension of Groswater Bay) on the Labrador coast of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Comprising and stretching inland to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, it forms part of the largest estuary in the province, primarily draining the Churchill River and Naskaupi River watersheds. Both Lake Melville and Hamilton Inlet are encircled by mountains, with primary settlements at Happy Valley-Goose Bay, North West River, and Sheshatshiu. It is the 46th largest lake globally.

==Name==
Lake Melville was named for Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville, who served as Britain&#x27;s lord of the Admiralty in 1804 and 1805.

==Geography==
Lake Melville is situated in central Labrador. To the south are the Mealy Mountains while another inlet (Double Mer) is located to the north. The Churchill River flows into the southwest point of Lake Melville. Lake Melville extends further inland between the communities of North West River and Sheshatshiu and these extensions are known as &quot;Little Lake&quot; and &quot;Grand Lake&quot;. The Naskaupi River flows into Grand Lake.

Lake Melville is served by the Trans-Labrador Highway network. Route 500 spans from the mouth of the Churchill River at Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Labrador West while Route 510 goes from Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Blanc-Sablon where a ferry can be taken to Newfoundland. Route 520 is a paved highway on the west coast of Lake Melville connecting Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Sheshatshiu and North West River. Rigolet and Mud Lake are the only two communities in the region that cannot be reached by road.

==History==
The area around Lake Melville was historically inhabited by the Inuit and the Innu. It is believed that Labrador&#x27;s Inuit migrated to Labrador from Baffin Island in search of Europeans (the Norse are thought to have landed at Baffin Island around 1000 AD). At the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, New France (including Labrador) was ceded to Great Britain. The British decided to develop a cod fishery in Labrador. The fishermen (who mostly came from Newfoundland), often married Inuit women and thus created the &quot;Inuit-Metis&quot;. In 1824, the population around Lake Melville was 326 which consisted of 160 Inuit, 60 &#x27;half-Inuit&#x27;, 90 European settlers, and 16 Canadian settlers.

The economy around Lake Melville was historically based around the fishery and fur. Fort Smith (present-day North West River) was the seat of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company factor for the surrounding territory. After John McLean discovered convenient riverine routes into the interior, it also was the supply centre for Fort Naskaupi. Fish and fur prices plummeted with the stock market crash beginning in 1929, weakening the meager though meaningful subsistence-based economy. Construction of an air base at Goose Bay in 1941 and radar installations along the coast offered Southern Inuit their first wage employment. Today, the town of Happy Valley-Goose Bay is one of the largest communities in Labrador and the tenth-largest community in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The Lower Churchill Project is a planned hydroelectric project on the lower Churchill River.

==Transportation==
A ferry service runs on Lake Melville and Hamilton Inlet, connecting a number communities including Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Rigolet and Cartwright.

<text>Leslie Ethelbert George Ames (3 December 1905 – 27 February 1990) was a wicket-keeper and batsman for the England cricket team and Kent County Cricket Club. 

Born at Elham, Kent, Ames began his first-class career with his home county of Kent in 1926, and was a regular player until the 1950s. Ames played 45 tests for England, and was part of the England squad that won the ashes in the infamous bodyline series of 1932–33. In his obituary, &quot;Wisden&quot; described him as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman of all time. He is the only wicket-keeper-batsman to score a hundred first-class centuries, and was a Wisden cricketer of the year in 1928.

==Early career==
Born in Elham, Kent, in 1905, he was mentored by Francis MacKinnon, an ex-county player who lived in the village and then, after leaving the Harvey Grammar School, Folkestone, by Gerry Weigall, the Kent county coach, who encouraged him to learn to keep wicket so he would have a better chance of playing for the county.

He received the call to play for Kent while playing in West Malling and made his debut for the county on 7 July 1926 against Warwickshire at the Nevill Ground in Royal Tunbridge Wells. He scored 35 and took four catches, despite not playing as a wicket-keeper in the match. He played one more County Championship match that season before becoming a regular in the 1927 season.

He went on the 1928–29 England tour of Australia, but only played in state matches. He made his debut for England in the Fifth Test against South Africa at The Oval on 17 August 1929, making a duck and taking two catches. His cap number for England is 244.

==Cricket career==
In Test cricket, Ames played 47 matches, scoring 2,434 runs with a batting average of 40.56. He took 74 catches and made 23 stumpings. In first-class cricket, he scored 37,248 runs at an average of 43.51, including 102 centuries and 176 fifties, and took 704 catches and 417 stumpings. Unusually for a wicket-keeper, he also bowled over 200 overs, taking 24 first-class wickets with a bowling average of 33.37.

Ames was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1929. He holds a number of wicket-keeping and batting records: 
*the most dismissals in an English county cricket season (127 in 1929);
*the most stumpings in an English season (64 in 1932);
*1000 runs and 100 dismissals in each of three seasons (1928, 1929, 1932), a feat that has only been achieved once again in county cricket;
*the only wicket-keeper to score 100 first-class centuries;
*in 1934 he was the last Englishman to score 100 or more runs before lunch in a Test match until Ian Bell did so seventy years later. Ames scored 120 runs in the session which is a record for most runs before lunch in Test cricket;
*centuries against every English first-class county, apart from his own county, Kent;
*the record 8th wicket partnership for England in Test cricket: 246 with Gubby Allen against New Zealand at Lord&#x27;s in 1931. This record was finally broken by Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad in 2010 when they scored 332 runs;
*the first wicket-keeper to score a century batting at number seven in Test Cricket.

After his final playing season in 1951, Ames became a successful manager and administrator. He managed MCC tours to the West Indies in 1967/68 when he deemed in his post-tour report that Basil D&#x27;Oliveira was a &#x27;bad tourist&#x27; who did not adjust well to overseas conditions, spent much of his time partying, and generally detracted from team morale. This had it has been argued some role in justifying the original non-selection of D&#x27;Oliveira for the 1968/9 tour to South Africa. When that tour was cancelled he managed the subsequent replacement visit to Sri Lanka and Pakistan in 1968/69. In 1950 he had been the first professional to be appointed as a Test selector, continuing until 1956 and serving again in 1958. He was the secretary and manager of Kent County Cricket Club, including when the side won the County Championship in 1970.

In August 1957, Ames formed an invitation team to play the touring West Indies at the Hastings Festival. The match was billed as L. E. G. Ames&#x27; XI v West Indians. Ames&#x27; team included Denis Compton, Colin Cowdrey, Jack Robertson, George Tribe and John Murray. Cowdrey scored 143 on the first day but West Indies won by 4 wickets.

==Outside cricket==
Ames joined football club Clapton Orient in 1926 making his League debut against Preston North End in January 1927 and a total of 14 senior appearances in five seasons, before briefly playing for Gillingham in 1931, where he made five appearances and scored one goal. His cricketing career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which Ames served with the Royal Air Force rising to the rank of Squadron Leader. He returned to play as a batsman for Kent after the war.

<doc id="825585" wikidata="Q1499994" url="?curid=825585" title="Hamilton Inlet">
<text>Hamilton Inlet is a fjord-like inlet of Groswater Bay on the Labrador coast of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Together with Lake Melville, it forms its province&#x27;s largest estuary, extending over inland to Happy Valley-Goose Bay and primarily draining the Churchill River and Naskaupi River watersheds. Lake Melville is generally considered a part of Hamilton Inlet and extends west of the deep, narrow passage at the community of Rigolet.
==Names==
It was given its present name in honour of Charles Hamilton, commodore-governor of Newfoundland in the early 1800s and former namesake of the inlet&#x27;s affluent, the Hamilton River (now the Churchill). Inclusive of Groswater Bay, it has also been known as Ivucktoke (Inuttitut: &quot;Aivitok&quot;); Eskimo or Esquimaux Bay (, &quot;Bay of the Eskimos&quot;); and St Louis Bay ().

==History==
In 1586, it was the scene of an Inuit attack on the expedition of John Davis which killed two and wounded others.

<text>The Seattle Star was a daily newspaper that ran from February 25, 1899, to August 13, 1947. It was owned by E. W. Scripps and in 1920 was transferred to Scripps McRae League of Newspapers (later Scripps-Canfield League), after a falling-out within the Scripps family. The company, which eventually became Scripps League Newspapers, Inc., owned the paper until 1942, when it was sold to a group of local Seattle businessmen including Howard Parrish, its publisher. Soon after the sale, it reverted to its previous broadsheet format after having been a tabloid for a short time. Of the three Seattle general circulation dailies (&quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; being the other two), it was the smallest in circulation, although it had been the largest paper in the city around 1900.

For most of its life the paper was known as the &quot;working man&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;working person&#x27;s&quot; paper. It was staunchly pro-labor, reflecting the values of E.W. Scripps. In 1919, it became vehemently anti-Japanese, especially toward Japanese-Americans who lived in its vicinity.

After World War II, all of its assets minus the building and machinery were sold to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; for $360,000 in 1947. Management said the sale was needed because of the rising labor costs and the newsprint shortage.

<text>Skonto FC was a Latvian professional football club, active from 1991 until 2016. The club played at the Skonto Stadium in Riga. Skonto won the Virsliga in the first 14 seasons of the league&#x27;s resumption (15 in total), and often provided the core of the Latvia national football team. With those 14 national championships in a row, they set a European record, men and women&#x27;s football combined, until the women of Faroese club KÍ Klaksvík won their 14th championship in a row in 2013.

Following financial problems, the club was demoted to the Latvian First League in 2016 and went bankrupt in December of that year.

==History==

===Fourteen titles in a row (1991–2004)===
Skonto FC was founded in 1991, under the guise of Forums-Skonto, and immediately started to win league championships, 14 in a row, until finishing second to FK Liepājas Metalurgs in 2005. In 2006, Skonto finished third in a close contest with FK Liepājas Metalurgs and FK Ventspils. Skonto also won the Latvian Cup on eight occasions, most recently in 2012.

Skonto had to win their early titles in fierce competition with FK Olimpija from Liepāja and RAF Jelgava. An additional game was required in 1992 season to break a tie and decide the winner. In the same 1992 season, Skonto FC made its debut in the Champion&#x27;s League by beating the Faroe Islands champions Klaksvíkar Ítróttarfelag. At season&#x27;s end, Aleksandrs Starkovs took over from Marks Zahodins as coach.

For the next 10 years in the domestic league none of their rivals were able to offer significant opposition to Skonto. For two seasons running the team did not lose a single match, surpassing their closest rivals by more than 20 points in the final standings, ensuring the regular title was awarded long before the end of the season. During the 1998 season, Skonto FC thrashed FK Valmiera 15–2, scoring the highest number of goals in a single game in the club&#x27;s history.

During these years Skonto FC supplied the Latvian national team with most of its players: Māris Verpakovskis, Marians Pahars, Aleksandrs Koliņko, Vitālijs Astafjevs, Igors Stepanovs, Imants Bleidelis, Juris Laizāns, Mihails Zemļinskis, Valentīns Lobaņovs, Andrejs Rubins, and others. In 2004, a Latvian squad stocked with Skonto players managed to qualify for the UEFA Euro 2004 championship in Portugal.

Defender Mihails Zemļinskis has made the most appearances for the club in domestic competition (252), and the most in European cup ties as well (52). Mihails Miholaps is Skonto&#x27;s all-time top scorer with 155 goals in 216 domestic matches, and 18 in 38 European cup matches. In July 2000 Skonto defender Igors Stepanovs was sold to the English Premier League club Arsenal for a fee around £1 million. In January 2001 midfielder Juris Laizāns joined the Russian Premier League side CSKA Moscow for £1,57 million, the highest ever transfer fee received by a Latvian club to date.

Skonto&#x27;s first major victory in the European came in 1994, when they defeated Scotland&#x27;s Aberdeen F.C., former European Super Cup winners; and in 1999 Skonto managed a 0–0 draw at home with Chelsea in a UEFA Champions League qualifier after losing 3–0 away two weeks earlier in what was Chelsea&#x27;s first game in the Champions League. Skonto FC also played as Latvian champion against European giants Barcelona and Internazionale.

An exciting battle for the Latvian championship title occurred again in the final round of the 2001 season when Skonto trailed FK Ventspils by two points as they faced an away match against Liepājas Metalurgs, a team which also had hopes of becoming champions. Ventspils lost their match; Skonto won theirs; and Skonto were Latvian champions once more.

===End of the winners&#x27; era (2005–2009)=== 
Starting from 2005 Liepājas Metalurgs and FK Ventspils were in a close pursuit of Skonto, with their attempts proving to be successful. In 2004, the head coach Aleksandrs Starkovs – one of the essential pillars of the club – left Skonto FC by accepting a proposal to work at Spartak Moskva, that time champions of Russia. The leadership of the team was entrusted to Jurijs Andrejevs, his long-term assistant, but after the loss against FK Rabotnički, of the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje in the UEFA Champions League qualification tournament, he resigned from the post. Jurijs Andrejevs was replaced by Paul Ashworth, who had previously worked with FK Ventspils and FK Rīga in the Latvian Higher League and FC Rostov in the Russian Premier League.

===Champions again (2010)===
On 8 July 2010, Skonto lost in the Europa League first qualifying round to the Northern Irish club Portadown. In the first leg Skonto drew 1–1 away from home after an equaliser in injury time. They lost 1–0 at home and went out to a team who hadn&#x27;t won a European tie in 36 years. Consolation came later in the season, when Skonto drew 2–2 at home to win the Latvian Higher League title for the first time since 2004. It was yet again done under the management of Aleksandrs Starkovs.

===Financial crisis and bankruptcy (2011–2016)===
In 2012 founder of the club and long-term president Guntis Indriksons left the post, as it was incompatible with the president&#x27;s post of the Latvian Football Federation according to the newly established rules. Former player Vladimirs Koļesņičenko took over and, furthermore, the club&#x27;s manager Marians Pahars accepted an offer to become the head coach of Latvia national U-21 football team. In 2012 Skonto won the Latvian Cup for the first time since 2002 and guaranteed themselves a spot in the first qualifying round of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, even though this was later succeeded once again following the league achievements in 2012.

In 2013 Georgian manager Tamaz Pertia took over and under his management Skonto went on playing without a single loss for 26 matches out of the league&#x27;s 27 regular games. Run down by injuries with a short amount of reserves, they were defeated by FK Jelgava in the last round of the tournament losing the title to FK Ventspils. Skonto participated considerably well in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League matches, beating Moldovan FC Tiraspol on aggregate in the first round and being close to knock out the Czech club Slovan Liberec, which later went on to reach Round of 32 of the tournament. In-mid summer Skonto were struck by severe financial problems as their sponsors ended the sponsorship program due to their own financial difficulties. This led to a major loss of income and long-term delays of salaries and other payments.

Before the start of the 2014 season Skonto, initially, were refused the A License necessary to play in the Latvian Higher League due to their long-term debts. However, the license was later obtained after a successful appeal. Sanctions followed from UEFA, with Skonto being disqualified from the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, which they had qualified for. On 30 May 2014 the Latvian Football Federation issued a ban on Skonto registering new players during the summer transfer window until all the debts had been cleared. On 6 July, due to long-term non-payment of salaries, Skonto players refused to play the away match against FK Liepāja and the club suffered a 3–0 technical loss. On 14 July, club president Vladimirs Koļesņičenko announced his resignation and the club was taken over by Igors Zaicevs. On 2 September due to non-fulfillment of liabilities in the prescribed terms, LFF took away three points in the championship table, but on 17 September this penalty was reduced to just one point. On 14 October it was announced that Latvia&#x27;s State Revenue Service had suspended the club&#x27;s economic activity, with the possibility for an appeal to be submitted within one month. A day later, an additional four points were taken away in the tournament table, with Skonto losing even the theoretical chance to win the 2014 championship. The same day Skonto announced the resignation of its president Igors Zaicevs, but the club was still considering the option to submit an appeal to the State Revenue Service. In November 2014 it was announced that Skonto had finally cleared its debts with that time and previous players, still being indebted to the State Revenue Service.

Skonto did not obtain a license to play in the 2016 Higher League. Skonto appealed the decision, but the appeal was denied. Since 2015 Latvian First League runners-up Valmiera Glass FK/BSS rejected the opportunity to be promoted to the Higher League, 3rd placed Rīgas Futbola skola (RFS) was promoted instead. The club went bankrupt and left the first league in December 2016.

Since the club was denied a license to play in the Latvian First League, its remnants merged with RTU FC under the name of Skonto Academy before the start of the 2017 season. The team, now named RTU FC/Skonto Academy, played in the league until 2019, when it withdrew, possibly due to financial reasons.

==Stadium==
Skonto played their home matches at the Skonto Stadium, which is also the home ground for Latvia national football team. The stadium was opened in 2000 and has a capacity of 10,000 people. Besides regular football matches this stadium has also hosted concerts of worldwide superstars like Depeche Mode, Massive Attack, Aerosmith and Metallica. The attendance of the last two was 32,000 and 33,000 people respectively. The record attendance in regards to a football match was reached on 15 November 2003, when Latvia beat Turkey 1–0 in the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification play-offs match and the game was attended by 9,500 spectators. The stadium is now used as the home-ground by the Latvian Higher League club Riga FC.

<text>The 1992–93 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the primetime hours from September 1992 through August 1993. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1991–92 season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcasts times for network shows may vary.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 1993 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

&quot;Note&quot;: Fox added a Tuesday night lineup in January, giving it a schedule on all seven nights of the week for the first time.

<text>Steak tartare or tartar steak is a French dish of raw ground (minced) beef. It is usually served with onions, capers, parsley or chive, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings, often presented separately, to be added to taste. It is commonly served topped with a raw egg yolk. It is similar to the Levantine &quot;kibbeh nayyeh&quot;, the Turkish &quot;çiğ köfte&quot;, the German &quot;Mett&quot; and the Korean &quot;yukhoe&quot;.

The name tartare is sometimes generalized to other raw meat or fish dishes. In France, a less-common variant called &quot;tartare aller-retour&quot; is a mound of mostly raw ground meat lightly seared on both sides.

== History ==
===Tatars and raw meat===
A popular caricature of Turco-Mongol warriors—called Tatars or Tartars—has them tenderizing meat under their saddles, then eating it raw. This story was popularized by the French chronicler Jean de Joinville in the 13th century, although he never actually encountered Tatars himself and used the story as a way of showing that the Tartars were uncivilized. It is possible that this story was a confusion originating in the use of thin slices of meat to protect saddle sores from further rubbing. &quot;The Cambridge Medieval History&quot; of 1924 says the story was started by early chroniclers who saw Mongol horsemen putting thin slices of raw meat beneath their saddles, but that the meat was meant to help heal the horses&#x27; sores rather than fill the men&#x27;s stomachs. The book notes that the meat would have been impregnated with sweat and uneatable by the end of the day. This has also been considered as the origin of pastirma.

===Popularization of raw meat in Europe and the United States===

In the late 19th century, the Hamburg steak became popular on the menus of many restaurants in the port of New York. This kind of fillet was beef minced by hand, lightly salted, and often smoked, and usually served raw in a dish along with onions and bread crumbs. Hamburg steak gained popularity because of its ease of preparation and decreasing cost. This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular cookbooks of the day. This preparation style was used by 1887 in some U.S. restaurants and was also used for feeding patients in hospitals; the Hamburg steak was served raw or lightly cooked and was accompanied by a raw egg.

It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared. While not providing a clear name, it is possible that the dish was popularized in Paris by restaurateurs who misunderstood Jules Verne&#x27;s description of &quot;koulbat&quot; (&quot;...a patty of crushed meat and eggs...&quot;) in his 1875 novel &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;.

===Origins of the name===
In the early 20th century, what is now generally known as &quot;steak tartare&quot; was called &quot;steak à l&#x27;Americaine&quot; in Europe. One variation on that dish included serving it with tartar sauce; the 1922 edition of Escoffier&#x27;s &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot; defines &quot;&quot;Steak à la tartare&quot; as &quot;steak à l&#x27;Americaine&quot; made without egg yolk, served with tartar sauce on the side. &quot;Steak à la tartare&quot;&quot; (literally meaning &quot;served with tartar sauce&quot;) was later shortened to &quot;steak tartare&quot; Over time, the distinction between &quot;steak à l&#x27;Americaine&quot; and its tartar-sauce variant disappeared. The 1938 edition of &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; describes steak tartare as raw ground beef served with a raw egg yolk, without any mention of tartar sauce.

&quot;À la tartare&quot; or simply &quot;tartare&quot; can still mean &quot;served with tartar sauce&quot; for some dishes, mostly fried fish. At the same time, the name &quot;tartare&quot; is also sometimes applied to other dishes of raw meats or fish, such as tuna tartare, introduced in 1975 by the restaurant Le Duc in Paris.

== Health concerns ==
Health concerns have reduced the popularity of this meat dish in some parts of the world because of the danger of contamination by bacteria and parasites such as &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and &quot;Taenia saginata&quot;.

===Bacteria===
According to the World Health Organization, when basic hygienic rules are followed and fresh meat is used, the risk of bacterial infection is low. However, in the United States, ground beef is not typically sold in the expectation that it will be eaten uncooked. The process of grinding beef can introduce any surface pathogens into the interior of the meat, where they pose greater danger. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends avoiding uncooked ground beef.

===Parasites===
&quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; is a parasite that may be found in raw or undercooked meat. A multicentre case-control study found inadequately cooked or inadequately cured meat as the main risk factor for toxoplasma infection in all centres. Due to the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in the fetus, pregnant women are advised not to eat raw meat. Latent toxoplasmosis, which lasts a lifetime, has been shown to cause poorer memory in the infected elderly. Latent toxoplasmosis in adults has been thought to, but not proven to, cause psychological effects and lower IQ in some studies.

&quot;Taenia saginata&quot; (beef tapeworm) may also be acquired via ingestion of undercooked beef. The tapeworm is transmitted to humans via infectious larval cysts found in cattle. People with taeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection because the symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent.

== Regional variations ==

<text>Drekavac, (literally &quot;the screamer&quot; or &quot;the screecher&quot;), also called drekalo, krekavac, zdrekavac or zrikavac, is a mythical creature in South Slavic mythology. The name is derived from the verb &quot;drečati&quot; (&quot;to screech&quot;).

== Description ==
In South Slavic mythology and folk tales this creature has been variously described:
* In some folk tales it is depicted as an undead man who emerges from his grave by night to haunt the living.
* In others the revenant is portrayed as unbaptised child which rises from its grave at night to haunt its parents and can also sometimes be heard entreating people passing cemeteries to baptise it and thus end its misery.
* In Eastern Serbia it has been depicted in the form of a humanoid canine creature that walks on its back legs.
* In the vicinity of Maglaj it has been depicted in the form of ghosts of soldiers that wander around during night time, scaring people.
* In the vicinity of Kozarska Dubica it has been depicted as a vampire-like undead man that rises out of the grave during night time, and wanders around scaring people.
* In the vicinity of Arilje it has been depicted in form of a long-necked long-legged creature with a cat-like head.
* In Sredačka župa it has been depicted in the form of a one-legged humanoid creature with glowing eyes that wanders around during night time and scares people.
* In the vicinity of Prijepolje, Lešak and Dragačevo it has been depicted as an apparition that can be seen in form of a dappled foal, dog, cat, or bird.
* In the vicinity of Gruža it has been depicted in the form of a creature having a dappled, elongated and spindle-thin body with a disproportionately large head. This creature can&#x27;t fly and it is believed to be the soul of a dead child. 

A modern description of a supposed drekavac describes it as a canine creature similar to a dog or some kind of bird.

== Original beliefs ==
The drekavac was originally thought to have come from the souls of sinful men, or from children who died unbaptised.

It was popularly believed to be visible only at night, especially during the twelve days of Christmas (called &quot;unbaptised days&quot; in Serbo-Croatian) and in early spring, when other demons and mythical creatures were believed to be more active. When assuming the form of a child, it predicts someone&#x27;s death, while in its animal form, it predicts cattle disease. The drekavac is believed to avoid dogs and bright light. Also, it is believed that if the shadow of drekavac falls upon some person then that person will turn sick and die.

== Modern sightings ==
Although the creature is mostly used in cautionary tales for children, there are also some adults who still believe in its existence. According to the guide of a reporter of &quot;Duga&quot; magazine, numerous villagers on the mountain of Zlatibor report seeing it, and many inhabitants claim to have heard it.

Some modern sightings happened:
* In 1992, it was reported that in the Krvavica, the villagers found remains of an animal unlike any known from the area, and claimed it was a drekavac. It was described as looking like a dog, but with a &quot;snake-like&quot; head and hind legs &quot;similar&quot; to those of a kangaroo. Later, it was revealed to be just a rotten carcass of a fox;
* In 2003, in the village of Tometino Polje near Divcibare, a series of attacks on sheep occurred, with some villagers concluding that they had been perpetrated by a drekavac. Other villagers disagreed, seeing as the attacks took place in the daytime, as opposed to night, when the drekavac is supposedly more active.

== Appearances and references in fiction ==
=== In literature ===
* Drekavac is mentioned in a short story by Branko Ćopić, &quot;Brave Mita and drekavac from the pond&quot; (Cyrillic: &quot;Храбри Мита и дрекавац из рита&quot;) in which a group of superstitious fishermen stop fishing because they hear mysterious yells in the pond, where they were usually fishing, and start believing that they hear a drekavac, which leads to hunger in the village. The protagonist of the story, a courageous village boy named Mita, investigates this mystery and captures the &quot;drekavac&quot;, which turns out to be a great bittern, a bird very rare for the area.
* Drekavac is also mentioned in Ćopić&#x27;s book &quot;Eagles Fly Early&quot;.
*Drekavac is a character in Larry Correia&#x27;s novel &quot;Monster Hunter Bloodlines&quot;.

This creature is described as: &quot;Big-headed and with long thin necks, drekavac often jump out of whirlpools to attack people who are returning home from watermills.&quot;
* In &quot;&quot;, a demon named Drekavac appears as a recurrent enemy. It is not named as such until player&#x27;s final encounter with it. Rather than claws, it possesses long thin swords.

<doc id="825643" wikidata="Q234074" url="?curid=825643" title="Pattie Boyd">
<text>Patricia Anne Boyd (born 17 March 1944) is an English model and photographer. She was one of the leading international models during the 1960s and, with Jean Shrimpton, epitomised the British female look of the era. Boyd married George Harrison in 1966, experiencing the height of the Beatles&#x27; popularity and sharing in their embrace of Indian spirituality. She divorced Harrison in 1977 and married mutual friend Eric Clapton in 1979; they divorced in 1989. Boyd inspired Harrison&#x27;s songs &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot;, and Clapton&#x27;s songs &quot;Layla&quot;, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;.
In August 2007, Boyd published her autobiography &quot;Wonderful Today&quot; (titled &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; in the United States). Her photographs of Harrison and Clapton, titled &quot;Through the Eye of a Muse&quot;, have been widely exhibited.

==Early life==
Boyd was born on 17 March 1944 in Taunton, Somerset, the first child of Colin (&quot;Jock&quot;) Ian Langdon Boyd and Diana Frances Boyd (née Drysdale). The Boyds moved to West Lothian in Scotland, where her brother, Colin, was born in 1946. They then moved to Guildford, Surrey, where her sister Jenny was born in 1947. After Jock&#x27;s discharge from the Royal Air Force, the Boyds lived in Nairobi from 1948 to 1953. Boyd&#x27;s youngest sister, Paula, was born at a hospital in Nakuru, Kenya, in 1951.

From the age of eight, Boyd boarded at Nakuru School near Nairobi. During a half-term break, she returned home and was shocked to learn that her parents had divorced. In December 1953, she and her siblings moved to England with Diana and her new husband, Bobbie Gaymer-Jones. With her mother&#x27;s second marriage, Boyd gained two half-brothers, David (b. 1954) and Robert (&quot;Boo&quot;; b. 1955). Many years later, she learned that she had two half-sisters through Jock&#x27;s second marriage.

Boyd briefly attended Hazeldean School in Putney, and then the St Agnes and St Michael Convent Boarding School in East Grinstead, and St Martha&#x27;s Convent in Hadley Wood, Hertfordshire. She achieved three GCE O level passes in 1961. She moved to London the same year and through her mother found work as a trainee beautician, age 17, at Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Bond Street salon. A client who worked for &quot;Honey&quot; magazine then inspired her to join an agency and begin work as a fashion model.

==Career==
===Modeling ===
Boyd began her fashion career in 1962, modeling at first in London and Paris. Among her regular assignments at that time were jobs for the UK edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot; in France, and &quot;Honey&quot;, as well as fashion spreads in newspapers such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. She was photographed by David Bailey, Terence Donovan and Brian Duffy, among others, and appeared on the cover of British &quot;Vogue&quot;. Other popular models of the day, such as Twiggy, based their modeling appearance on Boyd. In the description of journalist Tom Hibbert, Boyd and Jean Shrimpton became &quot;international celebrities&quot; as the embodiment of the &quot;British female &#x27;look&#x27; – mini-skirt, long, straight hair and wide-eyed loveliness&quot;. This look defined Western fashion for women as a result of the international popularity of the Beatles and other British Invasion musical acts from 1964 onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert/HistoryOfRock&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In her autobiography, Boyd recalls being known as the muse to designer Ossie Clark, who used to call some of his designs &quot;Pattie&quot;.
In early 1964, Boyd appeared in a television advertising campaign for Smith&#x27;s crisps, directed by Richard Lester. Lester then cast her as a schoolgirl in the Beatles&#x27; 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, where she met and befriended the group&#x27;s lead guitarist, George Harrison. Boyd&#x27;s modelling career skyrocketed as a result of her subsequent romantic involvement with Harrison. She recalls that further assignments for &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; were the result, along with jobs for &quot;Tatler&quot; (with photographer Jeanloup Sieff), more TV commercials, for Smith&#x27;s and for L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s Dop shampoo brand, and advertisements in newspaper fashion pages.

Boyd and Harrison were among the leading couples in the Swinging London era, when, according to a 1966 article in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;actors, pop singers, hairdressers, and models&quot; were London&#x27;s new &quot;privileged class&quot;. UK underground writer Barry Miles later described her as &quot;by far the most glamorous&quot; of all the Beatles&#x27; wives and girlfriends, while author Shawn Levy writes that, even more so than Jane Asher, the London-born stage actress who was Paul McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend for much of the 1960s, Boyd epitomised what &quot;sixties stardom was meant to confer upon its chosen&quot;. Writing in 1966, British fashion designer Mary Quant commented that it had become a requisite for contemporary women to strive &quot;to look like Pattie Boyd rather than Marlene Dietrich&quot;, adding: &quot;Their aim is to look childishly young, naïvely unsophisticated, and it takes more sophistication to work out that look than those early would-be sophisticates ever dreamed of.&quot;

At the request of Gloria Stavers, Boyd began writing a column, titled &quot;Patti&#x27;s Letter from London&quot;, for the American teen magazine &quot;16&quot;. According to Hibbert: &quot;She reported on the latest trends in Carnaby Street, informed readers as to what the Beatles and Stones were wearing at the moment, and gave advice on how to turn dark and curly hair straight and blonde.&quot; However, with Boyd the target of hostility from the Beatles&#x27; female fans, Harrison insisted she abandon her career, to ensure their privacy. In July 1968, she and her sister Jenny, who was also a model, opened a boutique in London&#x27;s fashionable Chelsea Market. They named it &quot;Jennifer Juniper&quot; after Donovan&#x27;s song of the same name. Jenny managed the shop, which sold antiques and other &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;, while Boyd was the buyer.

Boyd says she had &quot;virtually given up&quot; modelling by the early 1970s. She resumed her career at that time, promoting designs by Ossie Clark. She and Twiggy then did a cover assignment in Milan for Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; with photographer Justin de Villeneuve, and, working again with Bailey, Boyd appeared on several covers for British &quot;Vogue&quot;. In another shoot for the latter magazine, Boyd and her sisters were photographed by Patrick Lichfield.

===Photography===
Boyd began taking photographs of musicians and other friends during the 1960s and was a member of the Royal Photographic Society. In a 2008 interview, she said that it was not until 2004 that she felt &quot;emotionally ready&quot; to revisit the images. She also said that her lack of professional status probably made for a more intimate and authentic mood in her work, since her subjects were relaxed in her company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balfe/Ent.ie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd first exhibited her photos of Harrison and Clapton at the San Francisco Art Exchange on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2005, in a show titled &quot;Through the Eye of a Muse&quot;. The exhibition appeared in San Francisco and London during 2006, and in La Jolla, California in 2008. &quot;Through the Eye of a Muse&quot; was also shown in Dublin; in November 2008 at Toronto&#x27;s The Great Hall Gallery; at the Blender Gallery in Sydney; and in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in 2009–2010.

Her exhibition &quot;Yesterday and Today: The Beatles and Eric Clapton&quot; was shown on Santa Catalina Island in California, and at the National Geographic Headquarters in Washington, DC, in 2011.

===Charity work===
Boyd became involved in charity work following her separation from Clapton in the late 1980s. In 1991, she co-founded SHARP (Self Help Addiction Recovery Program) with Barbara Bach, the second wife of former Beatle Ringo Starr.

==Personal life==

===Marriage to George Harrison===
Boyd was in a relationship with photographer Eric Swayne when, at 19 (2 weeks away from her 20th birthday) she met Harrison, on 2 March 1964, and therefore declined his initial date proposal. Several days later, having ended the relationship with Swayne, she accompanied Harrison to a private gentlemen&#x27;s club called the Garrick Club, chaperoned by the Beatles&#x27; manager, Brian Epstein. With the Beatles frequently away on concert tours, she and Harrison subsequently saw each other as often as their professional commitments allowed. In July 1964, Harrison bought Kinfauns, a house in Esher, Surrey, to escape the constant attention of fans in central London, and Boyd soon moved into the house.

Boyd had her first encounter with LSD in early 1965 when the couple&#x27;s dentist, John Riley, secretly laced his guests&#x27; coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she was getting ready to leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a shop window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib Club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.

The couple were engaged on 25 December 1965, and married on 21 January 1966 in a ceremony at Epsom register office. In his &quot;How a Beatle Lives&quot; profile in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in March 1966, Harrison stressed the equality of their relationship and credited Boyd with broadening his outlook. In September and October, after the Beatles&#x27; final concert tour, Boyd and Harrison spent six weeks in India, as guests of Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar. While in Bombay, as Harrison continued his sitar studies under Shankar&#x27;s tutelage, Boyd began learning to play the dilruba, a bow-played string instrument. Due to the attention of fans and the press, they left the city with Shankar and stayed on houseboats on Dal Lake in Kashmir. On their return to England, Boyd and Harrison continued to adhere to a lifestyle of yoga and vegetarianism, and Boyd received further tutoring on the dilruba from Shiv Dayal Batish.

On 25 June 1967, Boyd was among the crowd of friends who participated in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Our World&quot; broadcast of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. Boyd shared her husband&#x27;s interest in Eastern mysticism. Having become a member of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in February 1967, she was keen to meet the movement&#x27;s leader, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and so suggested that she and Harrison attend his lecture on Transcendental Meditation at the London Hilton on 24 August. Impressed with the Maharishi, Harrison and Boyd, together with the other Beatles and their partners, travelled to a seminar he hosted in Bangor, Wales, the following day. Boyd and her sister Jenny then accompanied Harrison on the Beatles&#x27; visit to the Maharishi&#x27;s ashram in Rishikesh, India, in February 1968. That same year, she told Beatles biographer Hunter Davies that the four Beatles had a bond that neither she nor any other wives could penetrate; she also said she wished that the band would use their fame and influence to publicly further a cause, as Marlon Brando had done on behalf of homeless children. Boyd provided inspiration for several of Harrison&#x27;s Beatles compositions, including &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, &quot;Love You To&quot;, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot;.

On 12 March 1969, (McCartney&#x27;s wedding day to Linda) and as part of the perceived British authorities&#x27; less than tolerant attitude towards the Beatles during the late 1960s, both Boyd and Harrison were arrested at their home for possession of cannabis. They subsequently pleaded guilty and were fined £250 each.

In March 1970, a month before the Beatles&#x27; break-up, Boyd moved with Harrison to Friar Park, a Victorian neo-Gothic mansion in Henley-on-Thames. By this point, Harrison&#x27;s devotion to Indian spirituality, particularly the Hare Krishna movement, had begun to divide the couple. They were also unsuccessful in starting a family, and Harrison would not consider adoption. Boyd resumed her modelling career in May 1971, in defiance of Harrison&#x27;s spiritual convictions. In 1973, she had an affair with Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood while Harrison romanced Wood&#x27;s wife Krissie. Boyd said her decision to leave Harrison, in July 1974, was based largely on his repeated infidelities, culminating in his affair with Starr&#x27;s wife Maureen, which Boyd called &quot;the final straw&quot;.

Author Ian Inglis, discussing Harrison&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;So Sad&quot;, describes Boyd as the musician&#x27;s &quot;closest companion&quot; and someone who shared in his &quot;triumphs and tragedies&quot;. Among these key events, Inglis lists the international Beatlemania phenomenon, the Beatles&#x27; decision to retire from live performance, the 1967 Summer of Love, Epstein&#x27;s death, the creation of Apple Corps, the Beatles&#x27; exploration of Indian spirituality, the band&#x27;s break-up, Harrison&#x27;s ascendancy as a songwriter and then as a solo artist, and his Bangladesh aid project. The couple&#x27;s divorce was finalised on 9 June 1977. Boyd&#x27;s solicitor, Paddy Grafton-Green of the London firm Theodore Goddard, later remarked on the sensitivity shown by each party towards the other, which he found particularly rare in his experience of high-stakes divorces. He said: &quot;There was no overreacting, no greed or playing with each other&#x27;s emotions – I wish all divorces were so well handled.&quot;

===Marriage to Eric Clapton===

In the late 1960s, Eric Clapton and George Harrison became close friends and began writing and recording music together. Clapton fell in love with Boyd at this time. In an effort to satisfy his infatuation, Clapton briefly dated Boyd&#x27;s sister Paula. His 1970 album with Derek and the Dominos, &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;, was written to proclaim his love for Boyd, particularly the hit song &quot;Layla&quot;. Clapton drew inspiration from &quot;The Story of Layla and Majnun&quot; by Persian writer Nizami; based on a story about the seventh-century Nejdi Bedouin poet Qays ibn Al-Mulawwah and his lover Layla bint Mahdi (or Layla al-Aamiriya), the tale concerns a man driven to madness by his unattainable love. When Boyd rebuffed his advances in late 1970, Clapton descended into heroin addiction and self-imposed exile for three years.

In 1974, Clapton again pursued Boyd. Actor John Hurt later recalled that Harrison and Clapton staged a guitar &quot;duel&quot; over Boyd at Friar Park; Hurt added that it was &quot;extraordinary ... The air was electric. Nobody dare say a word.&quot; While Boyd supports this account,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meacham/SMH-Boyd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton has dismissed its significance. Boyd finally left Harrison on 4 July that year. She and Clapton were married on 27 March 1979 in Tucson, Arizona. They remained close friends with Harrison, who took to calling Clapton his &quot;husband-in-law&quot;.

Boyd soon struggled within the marriage and began drinking heavily, but these difficulties were masked by her public image with Clapton. He later admitted to abusing her while they were married and he was a &quot;full-blown&quot; alcoholic. Clapton and Boyd tried unsuccessfully to have children, trying in vitro fertilisation in 1984 and 1987, but were faced instead with miscarriages.

Boyd left Clapton in April 1987 and divorced him in 1989. Her stated reasons were Clapton&#x27;s years of alcoholism, as well as his numerous affairs, including one with Italian actress Lory Del Santo. In 1989, her divorce was granted on the grounds of &quot;infidelity and unreasonable behaviour&quot;. She subsequently suspected that Clapton&#x27;s pursuit of her when she was married to Harrison &quot;had more to do&quot; with the competitive aspect of the two musicians&#x27; friendship, and that &quot;Eric just wanted what George had.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to Boyd as a &quot;legendary rock muse&quot; for her role in inspiring the music of Harrison and Clapton,&lt;ref name=&quot;RS/SpillsBeans&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Alan Light of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Boyd–Clapton–Harrison love triangle as &quot;one of the most mythical romantic entanglements in rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Light/NYT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Cormier of &quot;Mental Floss&quot; similarly recognises her as &quot;one of the most important muses in rock and roll history&quot;. In addition to &quot;Layla&quot;, she was the inspiration for Clapton&#x27;s love songs &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Golden Ring&quot; for Boyd, in response to her sadness at learning of Harrison&#x27;s marriage to Olivia Arias in 1978, and the 1983 track &quot;The Shape You&#x27;re In&quot;, which addressed Boyd&#x27;s drinking.

===Marriage to Rod Weston===
Boyd met property developer Rod Weston in 1991. The couple were married on 29 April 2015 in a ceremony held at the Register Office in Chelsea Old Town Hall, London. Weston was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s almost our silver anniversary so we thought we had better get on with it.&quot;

==Autobiography==
In August 2007, Headline Review published Boyd&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;Wonderful Today&quot; and co-written with journalist and broadcaster Penny Junor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meacham/SMH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Re-titled &quot;Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Me&quot; for the US market, the book contains many of Boyd&#x27;s photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maslin/NYT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd carried out interviews to promote the release. At the time, she was said to be looking forward to the idea of her book competing against Clapton&#x27;s autobiography, which was published concurrently. Clapton disagreed with some of the details in her account but said, &quot;We each have our different versions of our years together.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;Wonderful Today&quot; for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Lynn Barber described it as &quot;absolutely gripping&quot; and a memoir that &quot;gives more insight into the weirdness of rock-star life than anything I have ever read&quot;. In the United States, the book debuted at the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

<text>The Tarbuck [[knot]] was made popular around 1952 by Kenneth Tarbuck, a climber and skier, for use by climbers, and was primarily used with stranded nylon ropes, before the advent of kernmantle ropes made this use both unnecessary and unsafe.
It was used when the rope is subject to heavy or sudden loads, as it will slide to a limited extent thus reducing shock (but with kernmantle ropes it can strip the outer sheath). The knot was already employed by 1946 as &quot;the knot&quot; by American tree trimmers.

<text>Black Sunday is the second studio album by American hip hop group Cypress Hill. It was released on July 20, 1993, by Ruffhouse and Columbia Records. The album proved to be a massive success just like their debut, &quot;Cypress Hill&quot;. The album debuted at #1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 261,000 copies in its first week of sales and became the highest Soundscan recording for a hip hop group at the time. Also, with their previous album, &quot;Cypress Hill&quot;, still in the charts, they became the first hip hop group ever to have 2 albums in the Top 10 of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time. The album went quadruple platinum in the U.S. with 3.4 million units sold.

As Cypress Hill advocates for medical and recreational use of cannabis, the booklet of the album contains 19 facts about the history of hemp and the positive attributes of cannabis.

==Background==
The first single, &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot;, became a crossover hit, starting a following among rock and hip hop audiences. A clean censored version of the album was also made which removes the song &quot;A to the K&quot;. The song &quot;Hand on the Glock&quot; is a re-recorded version of the track &quot;Hand on the Pump&quot; from the debut album &quot;Cypress Hill&quot;.

On July 20, 2023, an expanded edition of the album was released to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the album, featuring five additional songs.

==Reception==

The single &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Out Like That&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award&#x27;s Best Rap Performance of the year category.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; - 4 stars - Excellent - &quot;…it&#x27;s the Cypress combo of stark grooves and cinematic gangsta fairy tales that allows them to rule the streets, a formula not messed with on Black Sunday…&quot;

&quot;The Source&quot; - 4 stars - Excellent - &quot;…a darker sequel…this album is definitely worth buying as it easily rips the frame out of all those Cypress bandwagon jumpers…&quot;

* Included in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 Best Albums of 1993.

<text>Garcilaso de la Vega, KOS (c. 1501 – 14 October 1536) was a Spanish soldier and poet. Although not the first or the only one to do so, he was the most influential poet to introduce Italian Renaissance verse forms, poetic techniques, and themes to Spain. He was well known in poetic circles during his lifetime, and his poetry has continued to be popular without interruption until the present. His poetry was published posthumously by Juan Boscán in 1543, and it has been the subject of several annotated editions, the first and most famous of which appeared in 1574.

==Biography==
Garcilaso was born in the Spanish city of Toledo between 1498 and 1503. Clavería Boscán affirms he was born between 1487 and 1492, and another sources affirms he was born in 1501. His father Garcilaso de la Vega, the third son of Pedro Suárez de Figueroa, was a nobleman and ambassador in the royal court of the Catholic Monarchs. His mother&#x27;s name was Sancha de Guzmán.

Garcilaso was the second son which meant he did not receive the &quot;mayorazgo&quot; (entitlement) to his father&#x27;s estate. However, he spent his younger years receiving an extensive education, mastered five languages (Spanish, Greek, Latin, Italian and French), and learned how to play the zither, lute and the harp. When his father died in 1509, Garcilaso received a sizeable inheritance.

After his schooling, he joined the military in hopes of joining the royal guard. He was named &quot;contino&quot; (imperial guard) of Charles V in 1520, and he was made a member of the Order of Santiago in 1523.
There were a few women in the life of this poet. His first lover was Guiomar Carrillo, with whom he had a child. He had another suspected lover named Isabel Freire, who was a lady-in-waiting of Isabel of Portugal, but this is today regarded as mythical. In 1525, Garcilaso married Elena de Zúñiga, who served as a lady-in-waiting for the King&#x27;s favorite sister, Leonor. Their marriage took place in Garcilaso&#x27;s hometown of Toledo in one of the family&#x27;s estates. He had six children: Lorenzo, an illegitimate child with Guiomar Carrillo, Garcilaso, Íñigo de Zúñiga, Pedro de Guzmán, Sancha, and Francisco.

Garcilaso&#x27;s military career meant that he took part in the numerous battles and campaigns conducted by Charles V across Europe. His duties took him to Italy, Germany, Tunisia and France. In 1532 for a short period he was exiled to a Danube island where he was the guest of the Count György Cseszneky, royal court judge of Győr. Later in France, he would fight his last battle. The King desired to take control of Marseille and eventually control of the Mediterranean Sea, but this goal was never realized. Garcilaso de la Vega died on 14 October 1536 in Nice, after suffering 25 days from an injury sustained in a battle at Le Muy. His body was first buried in the Church of St. Dominic in Nice, but two years later his wife had his body moved to the Convento de San Pedro Mártir in Toledo.

==Works==
Garcilaso de la Vega is best known for his tragic love poetry that contrasts the playful poetry of his predecessors. He seemed to progress through three distinct episodes of his life which are reflected in his works. During his Spanish period, he wrote the majority of his eight-syllable poems; during his Italian or Petrarchan period, he wrote mostly sonnets and songs; and during his Neapolitan or classicist period, he wrote his other more classical poems, including his elegies, letters, eclogues and odes. Influenced by many Italian Renaissance poets, Garcilaso adapted the eleven-syllable line to the Spanish language in his &quot;sonetos&quot; (sonnets), mostly written in the 1520s, during his Petrarchan period. Increasing the number of syllables in the verse from eight to eleven allowed for greater flexibility. In addition to the &quot;sonetos&quot;, Garcilaso helped to introduce several other types of stanzas to the Spanish language. These include the &quot;estancia&quot;, formed by eleven- and seven-syllable lines; the &quot;lira&quot;, formed by three seven-syllable and two eleven-syllable lines; and &quot;endecasílabos sueltos&quot;, formed by unrhymed eleven-syllable lines.

Throughout his life, Garcilaso de la Vega wrote various poems in each of these types. His works include: forty &quot;Sonetos&quot; (Sonnets), five &quot;Canciones&quot; (Songs), eight &quot;Coplas&quot; (Couplets), three &quot;Églogas&quot; (Eclogues), two &quot;Elegías&quot; (Elegies), and the &quot;Epístola a Boscán&quot; (Letter to Boscán). Allusions to classical myths and Greco-Latin figures, great musicality, alliteration, rhythm and an absence of religion characterize his poetry. It can be said that Spanish poetry was never the same after Garcilaso de la Vega. His works have influenced the majority of subsequent Spanish poets, including other major authors of the period like Jorge de Montemor, Luis de León, John of the Cross, Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Luis de Góngora and Francisco Quevedo.

For example: (égloga Tercera):

::::&quot;Más a las veces son mejor oídos&quot;
::::&quot;el puro ingenio y lengua casi muda,&quot;
::::&quot;testigos limpios de ánimo inocente,&quot;
::::&quot;que la curiosidad del elocuente.&quot;

He was very good at transmitting the sense of life into writing, in many poems including his «&quot;dolorido sentir&quot;»:

::::&quot;No me podrán quitar el dolorido&quot;
::::&quot;sentir, si ya del todo&quot;
::::&quot;primero no me quitan el sentido&quot;.

We see the shift in traditional belief of Heaven as influenced by the Renaissance, which is called &quot;neo-Platonism,&quot; which tried to lift love to a spiritual, idealistic plane, as compared to the traditional Catholic view of Heaven. (&quot;Égloga primera&quot;):

::::&quot;Contigo mano a mano&quot;
::::&quot;busquemos otros prados y otros ríos,&quot;
::::&quot;otros valles floridos y sombríos,&quot;
::::&quot;donde descanse, y siempre pueda verte&quot;
::::&quot;ante los ojos míos,&quot;
::::&quot;sin miedo y sobresalto de perderte.&quot; (&quot;Égloga primera&quot;)

He has enjoyed a revival of influence among 21st century pastoral poets such as Seamus Heaney, Dennis Nurkse, and Giannina Braschi.

==Literary references==

Garcilaso is mentioned in multiple works by Miguel de Cervantes. In the second volume of Don Quixote, the protagonist quotes one of the poet&#x27;s sonnets. In El licenciado Vidriera, Tomás Rodaja carries a volume of Garcilaso on his journey across Europe.

The title of Pedro Salinas&#x27;s sequence of poems &quot;La voz a ti debida&quot; is taken from Garcilaso&#x27;s third eclogue.

In the novel &quot;Of Love and Other Demons&quot; by Gabriel García Márquez, one of the main characters, Father Cayetano Delaura, is an admirer of Garcilaso de la Vega. In the novel, which takes place in 18th-century colonial Colombia, Delaura is forced to give up being a priest because of his tragic love affair.

Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi wrote both a poetic treatise on Garcilaso de la Vega&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, as well as a book of poems in homage to the Spanish master, entitled &quot;Empire of Dreams&quot;.

<text>Ellery Schempp (born Ellory Schempp, August 5, 1940) is an American physicist and the primary student involved in the landmark 1963 United States Supreme Court decision of &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; which declared that required public school sanctioned Bible readings were unconstitutional.

==Biography==

Schempp was born in Philadelphia and grew up in the Roslyn community of Abington Township. He graduated from Abington High School in 1958, and attended Tufts University where he earned bachelor degrees in physics and geology. In 1967, Schempp received his Ph.D. in physics from Brown University.

In 1977, Schempp was part of the Pittsburgh Explorer’s Group Nanga Parbat Expedition which was to be the first American group to reach the peak of Nanga Parbat in Pakistan.

Schempp, who is retired, currently resides in Boston, Massachusetts.

Stephen D. Solomon, a professor at New York University, has written a book about Schempp and the Supreme Court case entitled &quot;Ellery’s Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition and Sparked the Battle over School Prayer&quot;.

==Activism==

On November 26, 1956, Schempp staged a protest against the school requiring that each student read 10 Bible passages and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer each day during homeroom. That day he brought a copy of the Qur&#x27;an and read from it; for this he was sent to the principal&#x27;s office. With the help of his father, Edward Schempp, and the American Civil Liberties Union, they sued the Abington School district over their policy of mandatory Bible readings.

To maintain standing in the case, Schempp (and later his younger siblings Roger and Donna) continued to fight this policy in the courts over several years. The Schempps were Unitarian Universalists, a theologically liberal religious community. The case was eventually decided in Schempps&#x27;s favor by the Supreme Court in 1963, five years after he had graduated from high school. The precedent that this decision established, that the public school does not have the right to sponsor religious exercises and then pressure students to take part in them has appeared time and time again in every church-state case focusing on religion in public schools.

Schempp considers himself to be an atheist, but supports the Unitarian Universalist organizations and is a strong supporter of the ACLU and of the separation of church and state. He is a popular speaker at Unitarian Universalist and secular humanist meetings, where he speaks about his landmark protest as well as the current state of democracy, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. As of 2011, he was still active in the Bedford Unitarian Universalist church near his home.

Schempp is a member of the American Humanist Association, the Freedom from Religion Foundation, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. In 1996, he received the Religious Liberty Award from Americans United. He is on the Advisory Board of the Secular Student Alliance and the Secular Coalition for America. He has traveled throughout the country talking about his experiences.

In 2002, Schempp was elected to Abington Senior High School&#x27;s hall of fame for his accomplishments in physics. In his acceptance speech, he said that &quot;When I left Abington in 1958, it wasn’t clear that Abington ever wanted to see me again&quot;. The award did include the notation “Initiated school prayer suit against Abington which was eventually decided by U.S. Supreme Court in 1963.”

==Physics==

Schempp&#x27;s doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance in Nitrogen Heterocycles&quot;. This work was the precursor to the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on which he continued to work for a substantial portion of his career.

<text>François J. Terby (9 August 1846 – 20 March 1911) was a Belgian astronomer. He had a private observatory at Leuven, Belgium and was an early ardent advocate of the existence of Martian canals.

He collected drawings of Mars and wrote the work &quot;Aréographie&quot; in 1875. He tracked down the Mars drawings of Johann Hieronymus Schröter and deposited them at Leiden University, where they would eventually finally be published in 1881.

A crater on Mars (Terby) is named after him.

<text>Firmenich SA was a Swiss company in the fragrance and flavor business. The company has created perfumes for over 125 years and produced a number of well-known flavors. Founded in 1895, it merged in May 2023 with the Dutch company DSM to form dsm-firmenich.

It employed 10,000 people across 46 manufacturing plants and six research and development centers.

==History==
The company was founded as Chuit &amp; Naef in 1895 in Geneva by chemist Philippe Chuit and businessman Martin Naef. Fred Firmenich joined in 1900 and later became the majority partner. The company was renamed Firmenich SA.

Originally a fragrance company, Firmenich branched into the flavor business by creating a raspberry substitute in 1938, followed by creations of citrus and strawberry flavor. Other synthetic flavors followed for use in ultra-processed foods and preserved foods.

In 1939, Firmenich Director of Research and Development Lavoslav Ružička was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his work on polymethylenes and higher terpenes,&quot; &quot;including the first chemical synthesis of male sex hormones.&quot;

On May 3, 2007, Firmenich announced that it would be acquiring the flavors&#x27; division of Danisco, Noville, in a deal worth €450 million. The deal was expected to move Firmenich ahead of IFF as the second-largest flavor company in the world.

Firmenich&#x27;s board named Gilbert Ghostine as CEO to succeed Patrick Firmenich, effective October 1, 2014. Patrick Firmenich was elected as chairman of Firmenich&#x27;s Board of Directors as of October 12, 2016.

On July 11, 2017, Firmenich completed the acquisition of Agilex Fragrances, expanding its ability to serve mid-sized customers in North America.

On December 13, 2017, Firmenich announced the acquisition of Flavourome, an established privately held flavors company in South Africa, to expand its presence in Africa. On February 5, 2018, Firmenich confirmed the successful completion of the acquisition.

In August 2018, Firmenich acquired Campus, an innovator in the application of &quot;natural functional ingredients for protein application&quot;, which specializes &quot;in clean label, meat, dairy, sauces and plant-based food&quot;. The research and production facilities of Campus are located in Italy and Monterrey, Mexico.

At some point, Firmenich acquired Natural Flavors, a manufacturer of flavors for the food and beverage industry.

In September 2018, Firmenich announced its intent to acquire Senomyx.

In June 2020, Firmenich acquired Les Dérivés Résiniques et Terpéniques (&quot;DRT&quot;), a world leader in plant-based chemistry, mainly from pine trees, and one of the leading suppliers globally of high quality, renewable ingredients.

In October 2020, Firmenich announced that it had created a flavour by means of artificial intelligence. It teamed with Microsoft who helped leverage &quot;the entirety of Firmenich’s broad raw material database&quot; to dissimulate &quot;a lightly grilled beef taste&quot; into its plant-based meat alternatives. Firmenich&#x27;s &quot;unique palette of ingredients&quot; and &quot;SmartProteins expertise in plant-based protein alternatives&quot; were instrumental in the innovation process.

In 2021, Firmenich was ranked second on FoodTalks&#x27; Global Top 50 Food Flavours and Fragrances Companies list, below Givaudan and above International Flavors and Fragrances. Major competitors include Givaudan, IFF and Symrise.

In 2022, Firmenich announced its ambition to merge with Dutch conglomerate DSM; the merger became effective in May 2023 and the resulting company is named dsm-firmenich.

==Lobby groups==
Firmenich is a member of the European Flavour Association.

In March 2021, Firmenich, Givaudan, IFF and Symrise launched the Fragrance Science and Advocacy Council.

<text>is a Japanese science fiction manga created by Shotaro Ishinomori. It was serialized in many different Japanese magazines, including &quot;Monthly Shōnen King&quot;, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;, &quot;Shōnen Big Comic&quot;, &quot;COM&quot;, &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot;, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot;, and &quot;Monthly Comic Nora&quot;. In 2012, comiXology acquired the digital distribution rights to Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s catalogue, including &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;.

==Plot==

Nine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization, led by the tyrant Skull, to undergo experiments that would allow him to use them as human weapons to promote the production of cyborg warfare. While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and Black Ghost. The nine cyborgs – from which the name of the series is derived – band together in order to stop Black Ghost from achieving its goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats, such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations.

==Media==
===Manga===

The first arc was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen King&quot; (Shōnen Gahosha). It depicts Cyborg 009&#x27;s origin story, the escape from Black Ghost, and the group running from the cyborg assassins. It ended with the battle against the Mythos Cyborgs.

The second arc, called &quot;The Underground Empire Yomi Arc&quot;, appeared in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; (Kodansha) alongside the release of the film version. The story is highly influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Earth&#x27;s Core&quot; series, including an expedition to the center of the Earth with a drill tank and a reptile race who can use telepathy and grow wings. The story ends with the final battle against Black Ghost. In the final scene, 009 and 002 fall into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and are seen as a shooting star by two small children, one of whom wishes for a toy gun and the other for world peace (a scene reminiscent of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;). As such, 001 was able to use his telekinetic powers at the last minute to retrieve 002 and 009 from their plummet before death.

The third arc, serialized in &quot;Bōken Ō&quot; (Akita Shoten), contained 6 story arcs, including the Monster Island Arc, the Middle East Arc, and the Angels Arc. The series abruptly ended during the Angels Arc.

The fourth arc, called &quot;The Battle of the Gods Arc&quot;, was serialized in &quot;COM&quot; (Mushi Production). Ishinomori resumed and retold the interrupted Angels Arc with a new plot, but the series once again ended abruptly. Ishinomori would not resume the series for a few years after this.

The fifth arc was serialized in &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot; (Shogakukan), and included the &quot;Wind City Arc&quot;, the &quot;Snow Carnival Arc&quot;, and the &quot;Edda Arc&quot;. The story deals with legendary and mythical like characters challenging the 00 Number Cyborgs.

The sixth arc followed closely after the fifth arc. Arcs such as the &quot;Deinonychus Arc&quot; (appeared in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; (Shueisha)) and &quot;Green Hole Arc&quot; (appeared in &quot;Play Comic&quot; (Akita Shoten)) were depicted, then long after, the &quot;Underwater Pyramid Arc&quot; was serialized in &quot;Monthly Manga Shōnen&quot; (Asahi Sonorama).

The seventh arc was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; (Shogakukan) alongside the revival anime. A long arc consisting of many short arcs, this series dealt with the battle against Neo Black Ghost as well as the emotional trauma of the 00 Number Cyborgs. The story is set approximately 20 years after the &quot;Yomi Arc&quot;, and the personalities and conduct of the cyborgs are depicted as more adult.

The eighth arc was serialized in &quot;Monthly Comic Nora&quot; (Gakken). This longer arc was called &quot;People Drifting Through Time and Space Arc&quot;, and is a sequel to the &quot;Immigration Arc&quot;. The Count of St. Germain from the Underwater Pyramid Arc appears, but the design of his drawing is different.

====Manga publication history====
The series was written and illustrated by Shotaro Ishinomori, serialized in &quot;Monthly Shōnen King&quot;, published in Japan by Akita Shoten and other companies through its history, and published in North America by Tokyopop.

Digital comics distributor comiXology licensed the entire catalogue from Ishimori Productions in 2012, and has made the first 10 volumes of &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; available to the public.

In April 2012, Shogakukan announced that the &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; manga would conclude in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. Entitled &quot;Cyborg 009 Conclusion: God&#x27;s War&quot;, the manga is to be illustrated by Masato Hayase and to be based on Ishinomori&#x27;s original concept notes, sketches, and novel drafts, all of which had been gathered by his son, Jo Onodera. &quot;Conclusion&quot; debuted on April 13, 2012, and ran until February 2014. It was collected in 5 volumes.

==== &quot;Cyborg 009 Bgooparts Delete&quot;====
A manga series written and illustrated by Tsuguo Okazaki, titled &quot;Cyborg 009 Bgooparts Delete&quot;, began serialization in &quot;Champion Red&quot; on July 19, 2019.

==== &quot;8 Man vs. Cyborg 009&quot; ====
A crossover manga between &quot;8 Man&quot; and &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; by Kyoichi Nanatsuki (script) and Masato Hayate (art), was serialized in &quot;Champion Red&quot; from July 18, 2020, to May 19, 2023. In this work, Black Ghost, revived after the Cold War, kidnaps 8 Man&#x27;s inventor, Tani, to blackmail 8 Man to destroy the 00 cyborgs, so that Black Ghost can dominate the world using a laser satellite created by Professor Demon (one of &quot;8 Man&quot;&#x27;s original antagonists). 8 Man, Professor Demon, and the cyborgs team up to destroy Black Ghost.

===Graphic novel===
A full-color graphic novel based on the franchise was released at San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2013, to align with the anniversary of Ishinomori&#x27;s original manga. The book is a condensed retelling of the 00 Cyborgs&#x27; battle against Black Ghost, led by Sekar (Skull). The full release was on September 11, 2013. The graphic novel is written by F. J. DeSanto and Bradley Cramp, penciled and inked by Marcus To, and published by Archaia Comics.

===Video games===
Three video games based on the series were released only in Japan. One of them was an action platformer released for the Super Famicom by BEC in 1994; for each level the player selects one of the eight adult cyborgs (001 is not playable) as the leader of a strike force for a particular mission accompanied by two others. The second game (released by Telenet Japan&#x27;s subsidiary Riot) in 1993 was for the Mega CD and is also a side scroller.

In 2002, &quot;Simple Characters 2000 Series Vol. 15: Cyborg 009: The Block Kuzushi&quot; was released for the PlayStation by Bandai.

==English releases==
The 1979 series was broadcast with English subtitles on Japanese-language television in Hawaii, California, and in the New York metropolitan area. The English subtitles were produced by San Francisco-based Fuji Television, which did not broadcast the series as part of its Japanese programming on KEMO-TV.

The 1980 film was released in the United States in 1988 by Celebrity Home Entertainment as &quot;Defenders of the Vortex&quot;, with an edited version of an English dub that was commissioned through the Tokyo, Japan-based Frontier Enterprises. It later received an unedited direct-to-video English release in 1995 by Best Film and Video Corporation with the full version of the same dub.

The 2001 TV series was licensed by Avex Inc. (the North American branch of Avex Mode, the 2001 series&#x27; original distributor in Japan) and dubbed into English by Animaze and ZRO Limit Productions. The entire series was dubbed, with the first 26 episodes shown on the Toonami programming block on Cartoon Network, while episodes 27 to 47 were shown on Cartoon Network&#x27;s late Friday night &quot;Graveyard Shift&quot; block, right before the show was dropped from their line-up. The first 8 episodes were distributed on DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment in a two-disc uncut bilingual set, as well as two dub-only edited broadcast volumes of four episodes each along with Portuguese and Spanish dubs. As of 2017, none of the other episodes have become available on home video outside Japan and Hong Kong, but Madman Entertainment released the first 26 dubbed episodes to DVD in Australia; they are since out of print. Discotek Media announced during their Otakon 2017 panel that they have licensed the 2001 series, and they will release the entire series, in the uncut bilingual version, on a SDBD set. The purpose for this set is to restore the uncut version of the dub for the whole series to its best state possible, as well as the video quality. The uncut dub master tapes were damaged upon arrival, due to the age of the DA-88 tapes. The set has an 11-page essay about the restoration process by the company&#x27;s producer and Anime News Network founder Justin Sevakis, along with an 83-page art gallery. The set was also the North American and dub premiere of the three-episode God&#x27;s War finale. The set was officially released on June 25, 2019.

The 2012 movie is licensed by Funimation in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. An English dub was produced by NYAV Post, and a theatrical release was released in all three territories.

<text>The 1993–94 network television schedule for the four major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the primetime hours from September 1993 through August 1994. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1992–93 season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcasts times for network shows may vary.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 1994 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

This is the first season in which Fox commenced television broadcasts on every night of the week from the beginning of the season onward.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

Note: From February 12 to 27, 1994, all of CBS&#x27; primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.

==Legend==
: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.

<text>An eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a type of lens that is attached to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. It is named because it is usually the lens that is closest to the eye when someone looks through an optical device to observe an object or sample. The objective lens or mirror collects light from an object or sample and brings it to focus creating an image of the object. The eyepiece is placed near the focal point of the objective to magnify this image to the eyes. (The eyepiece and the eye together make an image of the image created by the objective, on the retina of the eye.) The amount of magnification depends on the focal length of the eyepiece.

An eyepiece consists of several &quot;lens elements&quot; in a housing, with a &quot;barrel&quot; on one end. The barrel is shaped to fit in a special opening of the instrument to which it is attached. The image can be focused by moving the eyepiece nearer and further from the objective. Most instruments have a focusing mechanism to allow movement of the shaft in which the eyepiece is mounted, without needing to manipulate the eyepiece directly.

The eyepieces of binoculars are usually permanently mounted in the binoculars, causing them to have a pre-determined magnification and field of view. With telescopes and microscopes, however, eyepieces are usually interchangeable. By switching the eyepiece, the user can adjust what is viewed. For instance, eyepieces will often be interchanged to increase or decrease the magnification of a telescope. Eyepieces also offer varying fields of view, and differing degrees of eye relief for the person who looks through them.

== Properties ==

Several properties of an eyepiece are likely to be of interest to a user of an optical instrument, when comparing eyepieces and deciding which eyepiece suits their needs.

=== Design distance to entrance pupil ===
Eyepieces are optical systems where the entrance pupil is invariably located outside of the system. They must be designed for optimal performance for a specific distance to this entrance pupil (i.e. with minimum aberrations for this distance). In a refracting astronomical telescope the entrance pupil is identical with the objective. This may be several feet distant from the eyepiece; whereas with a microscope eyepiece the entrance pupil is close to the back focal plane of the objective, mere inches from the eyepiece. Microscope eyepieces may be corrected differently from telescope eyepieces; however, most are also suitable for telescope use.

=== Elements and groups ===
&quot;Elements&quot; are the individual lenses, which may come as simple lenses or &quot;singlets&quot; and cemented doublets or (rarely) triplets. When lenses are cemented together in pairs or triples, the combined elements are called &quot;groups&quot; (of lenses).

The first eyepieces had only a single lens element, which delivered highly distorted images. Two and three-element designs were invented soon after, and quickly became standard due to the improved image quality. Today, engineers assisted by computer-aided drafting software have designed eyepieces with seven or eight elements that deliver exceptionally large, sharp views.

=== Internal reflection and scatter ===
Internal reflections, sometimes called &quot;scatter&quot;, cause the light passing through an eyepiece to disperse and reduce the contrast of the image projected by the eyepiece. When the effect is particularly bad, &quot;ghost images&quot; are seen, called &quot;ghosting&quot;. For many years, simple eyepiece designs with a minimum number of internal air-to-glass surfaces were preferred to avoid this problem.

One solution to scatter is to use thin film coatings over the surface of the element. These thin coatings are only one or two wavelengths deep, and work to reduce reflections and scattering by changing the refraction of the light passing through the element. Some coatings may also absorb light that is not being passed through the lens in a process called total internal reflection where the light incident on the film is at a shallow angle.

===Chromatic aberration ===

&quot;Lateral&quot; or &quot;transverse&quot; chromatic aberration is caused because the refraction at glass surfaces differs for light of different wavelengths. Blue light, seen through an eyepiece element, will not focus to the same point but along the same axis as red light. The effect can create a ring of false colour around point sources of light and results in a general blurriness to the image.

One solution is to reduce the aberration by using multiple elements of different types of glass. Achromats are lens groups that bring two different wavelengths of light to the same focus and exhibit greatly reduced false colour. Low dispersion glass may also be used to reduce chromatic aberration.

&quot;Longitudinal&quot; chromatic aberration is a pronounced effect of optical telescope objectives, because the focal lengths are so long. Microscopes, whose focal lengths are generally shorter, do not tend to suffer from this effect.

=== Focal length ===
The focal length of an eyepiece is the distance from the principal plane of the eyepiece to where parallel rays of light converge to a single point. When in use, the focal length of an eyepiece, combined with the focal length of the telescope or microscope objective, to which it is attached, determines the magnification. It is usually expressed in millimetres when referring to the eyepiece alone. When interchanging a set of eyepieces on a single instrument, however, some users prefer to identify each eyepiece by the magnification produced.

For a telescope, the approximate angular magnification formula_1 produced by the combination of a particular eyepiece and objective can be calculated with the following formula:
:formula_2
where:
* formula_3 is the focal length of the objective,
* formula_4 is the focal length of the eyepiece.

Magnification increases, therefore, when the focal length of the eyepiece is shorter or the focal length of the objective is longer. For example, a 25 mm eyepiece in a telescope with a 1200 mm focal length would magnify objects 48 times. A 4 mm eyepiece in the same telescope would magnify 300 times.

Amateur astronomers tend to refer to telescope eyepieces by their focal length in millimeters. These typically range from about 3 mm to 50 mm. Some astronomers, however, prefer to specify the resulting magnification power rather than the focal length. It is often more convenient to express magnification in observation reports, as it gives a more immediate impression of what view the observer actually saw. Due to its dependence on properties of the particular telescope in use, however, magnification power alone is meaningless for describing a telescope eyepiece.

For a compound microscope the corresponding formula is
:formula_5
where
* formula_6 is the distance of closest distinct vision (usually 250 mm).
* formula_7 is the distance between the back focal plane of the objective and the back focal plane of the eyepiece (loosely called the &quot;tube length&quot;), typically 160 mm for a modern instrument.
* formula_3 is the objective focal length and formula_4 is the eyepiece focal length.

By convention, microscope eyepieces are usually specified by &quot;power&quot; instead of focal length. Microscope eyepiece power formula_10 and objective power formula_11 are defined by
:formula_12
thus from the expression given earlier for the angular magnification of a compound microscope
:formula_13

The total angular magnification of a microscope image is then simply calculated by multiplying the eyepiece power by the objective power. For example, a 10× eyepiece with a 40× objective will magnify the image 400 times.

This definition of lens power relies upon an arbitrary decision to split the angular magnification of the instrument into separate factors for the eyepiece and the objective. Historically, Abbe described microscope eyepieces differently, in terms of angular magnification of the eyepiece and &#x27;initial magnification&#x27; of the objective. While convenient for the optical designer, this turned out to be less convenient from the viewpoint of practical microscopy and was thus subsequently abandoned.

The generally accepted visual distance of closest focus formula_6 is 250 mm, and eyepiece power is normally specified assuming this value. Common eyepiece powers are 8×, 10×, 15×, and 20×. The focal length of the eyepiece (in mm) can thus be determined if required by dividing 250 mm by the eyepiece power.

Modern instruments often use objectives optically corrected for an infinite tube length rather than 160 mm, and these require an auxiliary correction lens in the tube.

=== Location of focal plane ===
In some eyepiece types, such as Ramsden eyepieces (described in more detail below), the eyepiece behaves as a magnifier, and its focal plane is located outside of the eyepiece in front of the field lens. This plane is therefore accessible as a location for a graticule or micrometer crosswires. In the Huygenian eyepiece, the focal plane is located between the eye and field lenses, inside the eyepiece, and is hence not accessible.

=== Field of view ===

The field of view, often abbreviated FOV, describes the area of a target (measured as an angle from the location of viewing) that can be seen when looking through an eyepiece. The field of view seen through an eyepiece varies, depending on the magnification achieved when connected to a particular telescope or microscope, and also on properties of the eyepiece itself. Eyepieces are differentiated by their &quot;field stop&quot;, which is the narrowest aperture that light entering the eyepiece must pass through to reach the field lens of the eyepiece.

Due to the effects of these variables, the term &quot;field of view&quot; nearly always refers to one of two meanings:

;&quot;True&quot; or &quot;Telescope&#x27;s&quot; field of view: For a telescope or binocular, the actual angular size of the span of sky that can be seen through a particular eyepiece, used with a particular telescope, producing a specific magnification. It ranges typically between 0.1–2 degrees. For a microscope, the actual width of the visible sample on the slide or sample tray, usually given in millimeters, but sometimes given as angular measure, like a telescope. For binoculars it is expressed as the actual field width in feet or in meters at some standard distance (typically either 100 feet or 30 meters, which are very nearly the same: 30 m is only a 2% smaller than 100 feet).
;&quot;Apparent&quot; or &quot;Eye&#x27;s&quot; field of view: For telescopes, microscopes, or binoculars, the &quot;apparent&quot; field of view is a measure of the angular size of the image seen by the eye, through the eyepiece. In other words, it is how large the image appears (as distinct from the magnification). Unless there is vignetting by the telescope&#x27;s or microscope&#x27;s body tube, this is constant for any given eyepiece with a fixed focal length, and may be used to calculate what the &quot;true&quot; field of view will be when the eyepiece is used with a given telescope or microscope. For modern eyepieces, the measurement ranges from 30–110 degrees, with all current good eyepieces being &quot;at least&quot; 50°, except for a few special-purpose eyepieces, such as some equipped with reticles.

It is common for users of an eyepiece to want to calculate the actual field of view, because it indicates how much of the sky will be visible when the eyepiece is used with their telescope. The most convenient method of calculating the actual field of view depends on whether the apparent field of view is known.

&quot;If the apparent field of view is known,&quot; the actual field of view can be calculated from the following approximate formula:
:formula_15

where:
* formula_16 is the true field of view (on the sky), calculated in whichever unit of angular measurement that formula_17 is provided in;
* formula_18 is the apparent field of view (in the eye);
* formula_19 is the magnification.

The formula is accurate to 4% or better up to 40° apparent field of view, and has a 10% error for 60°.

Since formula_20 where:
* formula_21 is the focal length of the telescope;
* formula_4 is the focal length of the eyepiece, expressed in the same units of measurement as formula_23

The true field of view even without knowing the apparent field of view, given by:

:formula_24

The &quot;focal length&quot; of the telescope objective, formula_25 is the diameter of the objective times the focal ratio. It represents the distance at which the mirror or objective lens will cause light from a star to converge onto a single point (aberrations excepted).

&quot;If the apparent field of view is unknown,&quot; the actual field of view can be approximately found using:
:formula_26
where:
* formula_16 is the actual field of view, calculated in degrees.
* formula_28 is the diameter of the eyepiece field stop in mm.
* formula_21 is the focal length of the telescope, in mm.

The second formula is actually more accurate, but field stop size is not usually specified by most manufacturers. The first formula will not be accurate if the field is not flat, or is higher than 60° which is common for most ultra-wide eyepiece design.

The above formulas are approximations. The ISO 14132-1:2002 standard gives the exact calculation for apparent field of view, formula_30 from the true field of view, formula_31 as:

:formula_32

If a diagonal or Barlow lens is used before the eyepiece, the eyepiece&#x27;s field of view may be slightly restricted. This occurs when the preceding lens has a narrower field stop than the eyepiece&#x27;s, causing the obstruction in the front to act as a smaller field stop in front of the eyepiece. The exact relationship is given by

:formula_33

An occasionally used approximation is
:formula_34

This formula also indicates that, for an eyepiece design with a given apparent field of view, the barrel diameter will determine the maximum focal length possible for that eyepiece, as no field stop can be larger than the barrel itself. For example, a Plössl with 45° apparent field of view in a 1.25 inch barrel would yield a maximum focal length of 35 mm.
Anything longer requires larger barrel or the view is restricted by the edge, effectively making the field of view less than 45°.

=== Barrel diameter ===
Eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes are usually interchanged to increase or decrease the magnification, and to enable the user to select a type with certain performance characteristics. To allow this, eyepieces come in standardized &quot;Barrel diameters&quot;.

====Telescope eyepieces====

There are six standard barrel diameters for telescopes. The barrel sizes (usually expressed in inches) are:

* 0.965 inch (24.5 mm) – This is the smallest standard barrel diameter and is usually found in retail toy store and shopping mall telescopes. Many of these eyepieces that come with such telescopes are plastic, and some even have plastic lenses. High-end telescope eyepieces with this barrel size are no longer manufactured, but you can still purchase Kellner types.
* 1.25 inch (31.75 mm) – This is the most popular telescope eyepiece barrel diameter. The practical upper limit on focal lengths for eyepieces with 1.25″ barrels is about 32 mm. With longer focal lengths, the edges of the eyepiece barrel intrude into the view, limiting its size. With focal lengths longer than 32 mm, the available field of view falls below 50°, which most amateurs consider to be the minimum acceptable width. These barrel sizes are threaded for 30 mm filters.
* 2 inch (50.8 mm) – The larger barrel size in 2″ eyepieces helps alleviate the limit on focal lengths; it is the largest size commonly available. The upper limit of focal length with 2″ eyepieces is about 55 mm. The trade-off is that these eyepieces are usually more expensive, will not fit in some telescopes, and may be heavy enough to tip the telescope. These barrel sizes are threaded for 48 mm filters (or rarely 49 mm).
* 2.7 inch (68.58 mm) – 2.7″ eyepieces are only made by a few manufacturers. They allow for slightly larger fields of view. Many high-end focusers now accept these eyepieces.
* 3 inch (76.2 mm) – The even larger barrel size in 3″ eyepieces allows for extreme focal lengths and over 120° field of view eyepieces. The disadvantages are that these eyepieces are somewhat rare, extremely expensive, up to 5 lbs in weight, and that only a few telescopes have focusers large enough to accept them. Their huge weight causes balancing issues in Schmidt-Cassegrains under 10 inches, refractors under 5 inches, and reflectors under 16 inches. Also, due to their large field stops, without large-diameter secondary mirrors, most reflectors and Schmidt-Cassegrains will have severe vignetting with these eyepieces.
* 4 inch (102 mm) – Eyepieces this size are rare, and only commonly used for long refracting telescopes in older observatories. Very few manufacturers make them, and with the current popularity of short focal length / smaller focal ratio telescopes among amateurs, the demand for this size is low. They are sometimes improvised from re‑adapted lenses scavenged out of old cinema projectors.

====Microscope eyepieces====
Eyepieces for microscopes have a variety of barrel diameters, usually given in millimeters, such as 23.2 mm and 30 mm.

=== Eye relief ===
The eye needs to be held at a certain distance behind the eye lens of an eyepiece to see images properly through it. This distance is called the eye relief. A larger eye relief means that the optimum position is farther from the eyepiece, making it easier to view an image. However, if the eye relief is too large it can be uncomfortable to hold the eye in the correct position for an extended period of time, for which reason some eyepieces with long eye relief have cups behind the eye lens to aid the observer in maintaining the correct observing position. The eye pupil should coincide with the exit pupil, the image of the entrance pupil, which in the case of an astronomical telescope corresponds to the object glass.

Eye relief typically ranges from about 2 mm to 20 mm, depending on the construction of the eyepiece. Long focal-length eyepieces usually have ample eye relief, but short focal-length eyepieces are more problematic. Until recently, and still quite commonly, eyepieces of a short-focal length have had a short eye relief. Good design guidelines suggest a minimum of 5–6 mm to accommodate the eyelashes of the observer to avoid discomfort. Modern designs with many lens elements, however, can correct for this, and viewing at high power becomes more comfortable. This is especially the case for spectacle wearers, who may need up to 20 mm of eye relief to accommodate their glasses.

== Designs ==
Technology has developed over time and there are a variety of eyepiece &quot;designs&quot; for use with telescopes, microscopes, gun-sights, and other devices. Some of these designs are described in more detail below.

===Negative lens or &quot;Galilean&quot;===

The simple negative lens placed before the focus of the objective has the advantage of presenting an erect image but with limited field of view better suited to low magnification. It is suspected this type of lens was used in some of the first refracting telescopes that appeared in the Netherlands in about 1608. It was also used in Galileo Galilei&#x27;s 1609 telescope design which gave this type of eyepiece arrangement the name &quot;Galilean&quot;. This type of eyepiece is still used in very cheap telescopes, binoculars and in opera glasses.

===Convex lens===

A simple convex lens placed after the focus of the objective lens presents the viewer with a magnified inverted image. This configuration may have been used in the first refracting telescopes from the Netherlands and was proposed as a way to have a much wider field of view and higher magnification in telescopes in Johannes Kepler&#x27;s 1611 book &quot;Dioptrice&quot;. Since the lens is placed after the focal plane of the objective it also allowed for use of a micrometer at the focal plane (used for determining the angular size and/or distance between objects observed).

=== Huygens ===
Huygens eyepieces consist of two plano-convex lenses with the plane sides towards the eye separated by an air gap. The lenses are called the eye lens and the field lens. The focal plane is located between the two lenses. It was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the late 1660s and was the first compound (multi-lens) eyepiece. Huygens discovered that two air spaced lenses can be used to make an eyepiece with zero transverse chromatic aberration. If the lenses are made of glass of the same Abbe number, to be used with a relaxed eye and a telescope with an infinitely distant objective then the separation is given by:
:formula_35
where formula_36 and formula_37 are the focal lengths of the component lenses.

These eyepieces work well with the very long focal length telescopes.
This optical design is now considered obsolete since with today&#x27;s shorter focal length telescopes the eyepiece suffers from short eye relief, high image distortion, axial chromatic aberration, and a very narrow apparent field of view. Since these eyepieces are cheap to make they can often be found on inexpensive telescopes and microscopes.

Because Huygens eyepieces do not contain cement to hold the lens elements, telescope users sometimes use these eyepieces in the role of &quot;solar projection&quot;, i.e. projecting an image of the Sun onto a screen for prolonged periods of time. Cemented eyepieces are traditionally regarded as potentially vulnerable to heat damage by the intense concentrations of light involved.

===Ramsden===

The Ramsden eyepiece comprises two plano-convex lenses of the same glass and similar focal lengths, placed less than one eye-lens focal length apart, a design created by astronomical and scientific instrument maker Jesse Ramsden in 1782. The lens separation varies between different designs, but is typically somewhere between and of the focal length of the eye-lens, the choice being a trade off between residual transverse chromatic aberration (at low values) and at high values running the risk of the field lens touching the focal plane when used by an observer who works with a close virtual image such as a myopic observer, or a young person whose accommodation is able to cope with a close virtual image (this is a serious problem when used with a micrometer as it can result in damage to the instrument).

A separation of exactly 1 focal length is also inadvisable since it renders the dust on the field lens disturbingly in focus. The two curved surfaces face inwards. The focal plane is thus located outside of the eyepiece and is hence accessible as a location where a graticule, or micrometer crosshairs may be placed. Because a separation of exactly one focal length would be required to correct transverse chromatic aberration, it is not possible to correct the Ramsden design completely for transverse chromatic aberration. The design is slightly better than Huygens but still not up to today&#x27;s standards.

It remains highly suitable for use with instruments operating using near-monochromatic light sources &quot;e.g.&quot; polarimeters.

=== Kellner or &quot;Achromat&quot; ===

In a Kellner eyepiece an achromatic doublet is used in place of the simple plano-convex eye lens in the Ramsden design to correct the residual transverse chromatic aberration. Carl Kellner designed this first modern achromatic eyepiece in 1849, also called an &quot;achromatized Ramsden&quot;. Kellner eyepieces are a 3-lens design. They are inexpensive and have fairly good image from low to medium power and are far superior to Huygenian or Ramsden design. The eye relief is better than the Huygenian and worse than the Ramsden eyepieces. The biggest problem of Kellner eyepieces was internal reflections. Today&#x27;s anti-reflection coatings make these usable, economical choices for small to medium aperture telescopes with focal ratio f/6 or longer. The typical apparent field of view is 40–50°.

===Plössl or &quot;Symmetrical&quot;===

The Plössl is an eyepiece usually consisting of two sets of doublets, designed by Georg Plössl in 1860. Since the two doublets can be identical this design is sometimes called a &quot;symmetrical eyepiece&quot;. The compound Plössl lens provides a large 50° or more &quot;apparent&quot; field of view, along with the proportionally large true FOV. This makes this eyepiece ideal for a variety of observational purposes including deep-sky and planetary viewing. The chief disadvantage of the Plössl optical design is short eye relief compared to an orthoscopic, since the Plössl eye relief is restricted to about 70–80% of focal length. The short eye relief is more critical in short focal lengths below about 10 mm, when viewing can become uncomfortable – especially for people wearing glasses.

The Plössl eyepiece was an obscure design until the 1980s when astronomical equipment manufacturers started selling redesigned versions of it. Today it is a very popular design on the amateur astronomical market, where the name &quot;Plössl&quot; covers a range of eyepieces with at least four optical elements, sometimes overlapping with the Erfle design.

This eyepiece is one of the more expensive to manufacture because of the quality of glass, and the need for well matched convex and concave lenses to prevent internal reflections. Due to this fact, the quality of different Plössl eyepieces varies. There are notable differences between cheap Plössls with simplest anti-reflection coatings and well made ones.

=== Orthoscopic or &quot;Abbe&quot; ===

The 4-element orthoscopic eyepiece consists of a plano-convex singlet eye lens and a cemented convex-convex triplet field lens achromatic field lens. This gives the eyepiece a nearly perfect image quality and good eye relief, but a narrow apparent field of view — about 40°–45°. It was invented by Ernst Abbe in 1880. It is called &quot;&quot;orthoscopic&quot; or &quot;orthographic&quot;&quot; because of its low degree of distortion and is also sometimes called an &quot;ortho&quot; or &quot;Abbe&quot;.

Until the advent of multicoatings and the popularity of the Plössl, orthoscopics were the most popular design for telescope eyepieces. Even today these eyepieces are considered good eyepieces for planetary and lunar viewing. They are preferred for reticle eyepieces, since they are one of the wide-field, long eye-relief designs with an external focal plane; slowly being supplanted by the König. Due to their low degree of distortion and the corresponding globe effect, they are less suitable for applications which require an extensive panning of the instrument.

=== Monocentric ===

A Monocentric is an achromatic triplet lens with two pieces of crown glass cemented on both sides of a flint glass element. The elements are thick, strongly curved, and their surfaces have a common center giving it the name &quot;monocentric&quot;. It was invented by H.A. Steinheil around 1883. This design, like the solid eyepiece designs of Tolles, Hastings, and Taylor, is free from ghost reflections and gives a bright contrasty image, a desirable feature when it was invented (before anti-reflective coatings). It has a narrow apparent field of view around 25° but was favored by planetary observers.

=== Erfle ===

An Erfle is a 5 element eyepiece consisting of 2 achromatic doublets with an extra simple lens between them. They were invented by Heinrich Erfle during World War I for military use. The design is an elementary extension of 4 element eyepieces such as Plössls, enhanced for wider fields.

Erfle eyepieces are designed to have wide field of view (about 60°), but are unusable at high powers because they suffer from astigmatism and ghost images.
However, with lens coatings at low powers (focal lengths of 20~30 mm and up) they are acceptable, and at 40 mm they can be excellent. Erfles are very popular for wide-field views, because they have large eye lenses, and can be very comfortable to use because of their good eye relief in longer focal lengths.

===König===

The König eyepiece has a concave-convex positive doublet and a plano-convex singlet. The strongly convex surfaces of the doublet and singlet face and (nearly) touch each other. The doublet has its concave surface facing the light source and the singlet has its almost flat (slightly convex) surface facing the eye. It was designed in 1915 by German optician Albert König (1871−1946) and is effectively a simplified Abbe. The design allows for high magnification with remarkably high eye relief – the longest eye relief proportional to focal length of any design before the Nagler, in 1979. The field of view of about 55° is slightly superior to the Plössl, with the further advantages of better eye relief and requiring one less lens element.

Modern improvements typically have fields of view of 60°−70°. König design revisions use exotic glass and / or add more lens groups; the most typical adaptation is to add a simple positive, concave-convex lens before the doublet, with the concave face towards the light source and the convex surface facing the doublet.

=== RKE ===

An RKE eyepiece has an achromatic field lens and double convex eye lens, a reversed adaptation of the Kellner eyepiece, with its lens layout similar to the König. It was designed by Dr. David Rank for the Edmund Scientific Corporation, who marketed it throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. This design provides slightly wider field of view than classic Kellner design and makes its design similar to a widely spaced version of the König.

According to Edmund Scientific Corporation, &quot;RKE&quot; stands for &quot;Rank Kellner Eyepiece&#x27;&quot;. In an amendment to their trademark application on 16 January 1979 it was given as &quot;Rank-Kaspereit-Erfle&quot;, the three designs from which the eyepiece was derived. &quot;Edmund Astronomy News&quot; (March 1978) called the eyepiece the &quot;Rank-Kaspereit-Erfle&quot; (RKE) a &quot;redesign[ed] ... type II Kellner&quot;. However, the RKE deign does not resemble a Kellner, and is closer to a modified König. There is some speculation that at some point the &quot;K&quot; was mistakenly interpreted as the name of the more common Kellner, instead of the fairly rarely seen König.

=== Nagler ===
Invented by Albert Nagler and patented in 1979, the Nagler eyepiece is a design optimized for astronomical telescopes to give an ultra-wide field of view (82°) that has good correction for astigmatism and other aberrations. Introduced in 2007, the Ethos is an enhanced ultra-wide field design developed principally by Paul Dellechiaie under Albert Nagler&#x27;s guidance at Tele Vue Optics and claims a 100–110° AFOV. This is achieved using exotic high-index glass and up to eight optical elements in four or five groups; there are several similar designs called the &quot;Nagler&quot;, &quot;Nagler type 2&quot;, &quot;Nagler type 4&quot;, &quot;Nagler type 5&quot;, and &quot;Nagler type 6&quot;. The newer Delos design is a modified Ethos design with a FOV of &#x27;only&#x27; 72 degrees but with a long 20 mm eye relief.

The number of elements in a Nagler makes them seem complex, but the idea of the design is fairly simple: every Nagler has a negative doublet field lens, which increases magnification, followed by several positive groups. The positive groups, considered separate from the first negative group, combine to have long focal length, and form a positive lens. That allows the design to take advantage of the many good qualities of low power lenses. In effect, a Nagler is a superior version of a Barlow lens combined with a long focal length eyepiece. This design has been widely copied in other wide field or long eye relief eyepieces.

The main disadvantage to Naglers is in their weight; they are often ruefully referred to as ‘hand grenades’ because of their heft and large size. Long focal length versions exceed , which is enough to unbalance small to medium-sized telescopes. Another disadvantage is a high purchase cost, with large Naglers&#x27; prices comparable to the cost of a small telescope. Hence these eyepieces are regarded by many amateur astronomers as a luxury.

<doc id="825702" wikidata="Q1351048" url="?curid=825702" title="British Aerospace Harrier II">
<text>The British Aerospace Harrier II is a second-generation vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) jet aircraft used previously by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and, between 2006 and 2010, the Royal Navy (RN). The aircraft was the latest development of the Harrier family, and was derived from the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II. Initial deliveries of the Harrier II were designated in service as Harrier GR5; subsequently upgraded airframes were redesignated accordingly as GR7 and GR9.

Under the Joint Force Harrier organisation, both the RAF and RN operated the Harrier II under the RAF&#x27;s Air Command, including deployments on board the navy&#x27;s s. The Harrier II participated in numerous conflicts, making significant contributions in combat theatres such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The type&#x27;s main function was as a platform for air interdiction and close air support missions; the Harrier II was also used for power projection and reconnaissance duties. The Harrier II served alongside the Sea Harrier in Joint Force Harrier.

In December 2010, budgetary pressures led to the early retirement of all Harrier IIs from service, at which point it was the last of the Harrier derivatives remaining in British service. In March 2011, the decision to retire the Harrier was controversial as there was no immediate fixed-wing replacement in its role or fixed-wing carrier-capable aircraft left in service at the time; in the long term, the Harrier II was replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
Development of a much more powerful successor to the Harrier began in 1973 as a cooperative effort between McDonnell Douglas (MDD) in the US and Hawker Siddeley (in 1977, its aviation interests were nationalised to form part of British Aerospace) in the UK. First-generation Harriers were being introduced into Royal Air Force and United States Marine Corps; operational experience had highlighted demand for a more capable aircraft. The British government had only a minor requirement, for up to 60 Harriers at most and competing pressures on the defence budget left little room for frivolous expenditure such as the Advanced Harrier. A lack of government backing for developing the necessary engine of the new aircraft, the &quot;Pegasus 15&quot;, led Hawker to withdraw from this project in 1975.

Due to US interest, work proceeded on the development of a less ambitious successor, a Harrier fitted with a larger wing and making use of composite materials in its construction. Two prototypes were built from existing aircraft and flew in 1978. The US government was content to continue if a major foreign buyer was found and Britain had a plan to improve the Harrier with a new, larger metal wing. In 1980, the UK considered if the American program would meet their requirements – their opinion was that it required modification, thus the MDD wing design was altered to incorporate the British-designed leading-edge root extensions. In 1982, the UK opted to become fully involved in the joint US–UK programme. The US and UK agreement to proceed included a British contribution of US$280 million to cover development costs to meet their own requirements and to purchase at least 60 aircraft.

The UK agreement included the involvement of British Aerospace (BAe) as a major subcontractor, manufacturing sections such as the rear fuselage for all customers of the AV-8B. The Harrier II was an Anglicised version of the AV-8B, British Aerospace producing the aircraft as the prime contractor, with McDonnell Douglas serving as a sub-contractor; final assembly work was performed at Dunsfold, England. The first prototype flew in 1981, first BAe-built development GR5 flew for the first time on 30 April 1985 and the aircraft entered service in July 1987. The GR5 had many differences from the USMC AV-8B Harriers, such as avionics fit, armaments and equipment; the wing of the GR5 featured a stainless steel leading edge, giving it different flex characteristics from the AV-8B. In December 1989, the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier II was declared operational.

===Description and role===

The Harrier II is an extensively modified version of the first generation Harrier GR1/GR3 series. The original aluminium alloy fuselage was replaced with one made extensively of composites, providing significant weight reduction and increased payload or range. A new one-piece wing provides around 14 per cent more area and increased thickness. The wing and leading-edge root extensions allows for a 6,700-pound (3,035 kg) payload increase over a 1,000 ft (300 m) takeoff compared with the first generation Harriers. The RAF&#x27;s Harrier IIs feature an additional missile pylon in front of each wing landing gear, as well as strengthened leading edges on the wings in order to meet higher bird strike requirements. Among the major differences with the American cousin, was the new ZEUS Electronic countermeasure (ECM) system, also proposed for the USMC AV-8 (which retained, after an evaluation, the original ALQ-164). ZEUS was one of the main systems in the British design, being a modern and costly apparatus, with an estimated cost of $1.7 million per set.

The Harrier II&#x27;s cockpit has day and night operability and is equipped with head-up display (HUD), two head-down displays known as multi-purpose colour displays (MPCD), a digital moving map, an inertial navigation system (INS), and a hands-on-throttle-and-stick system (HOTAS). Like the British Aerospace Sea Harrier, the Harrier II used an elevated bubble canopy to provide a significantly improved all-round view. A combination of the new design of the control system and the greater stability of the aircraft made the Harrier II fundamentally easier to fly than the first generation Harrier GR1/GR3 models.
The RAF used Harriers in the ground attack and reconnaissance roles, so they relied on the short-range AIM-9 Sidewinder missile for air combat. The Sidewinder had proven effective for Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Harriers against Argentinian Mirages in the Falklands War; however, from 1993 the Sea Harrier FA2 could also carry the much longer-range AIM-120 AMRAAM, a radar-guided missile. The Sea Harrier had a radar since its introduction and the USMC later equipped their AV-8B Harriers with a radar as part of the AV-8B+ upgrade; however Britain&#x27;s Harrier IIs never carried a radar. When the Sea Harrier was retired, it was suggested that its Blue Vixen radar could be transferred to the Harrier IIs. However, the Ministry of Defence rejected this as risky and too expensive; the Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram estimated that the cost would be in excess of £600 million.

===Further developments===
Even prior to the Harrier GR5 entering service, it was clear that alterations were required for the aircraft to be more capable in the interdictor role. A more advanced model, designated as the Harrier GR7, was developed primarily to add a night-time operational capability and avionics improvements. The GR7 development programme operated in conjunction with a similar USMC initiative upon its AV-8B Harrier fleet. Additional avionics include a nose-mounted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and night vision goggles, a missile approach warning system (MAW), an electronic countermeasures suite, new cockpit displays and a replacement moving map system. The GR7 conducted its maiden flight in May 1990 and entered service in August 1990. Following the full delivery of 34 Harrier GR7s in 1991, all of the GR5s underwent avionics upgrades to become GR7s as well.
Some GR7s were equipped with uprated Rolls-Royce Pegasus engines, correspondingly redesignated as GR7A; these Harriers had significantly improved takeoff and landing capabilities, and could carry greater payloads. In order to guide laser-guided bombs, from 1998 onwards a number of TIALD laser designator pods were made available to the Harrier II fleet, however these proved to be extremely scarce and often unavailable for pilot training. In response to difficulties experienced while communicating with NATO aircraft during the 1999 Kosovo War, the GR7s were upgraded with encrypted communications equipment.

A further major upgrade programme from the GR7 standard was conducted; the Harrier GR9. The GR9 was developed via the Joint Update and Maintenance Programme (JUMP), which significantly upgraded the Harrier fleet&#x27;s avionics, communications systems, and weapons capabilities during scheduled periods of maintenance in an incremental manner. The upgrade also replaced the composite rear fuselage of the GR7 with one made of metal which was less vulnerable to damage from engine vibrations. The first of the incremental improvements started with software upgrades to the communications, ground proximity warning and navigation systems, followed by the integration of the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile. Capability C added the RAF&#x27;s Rangeless Airborne Instrumentation Debriefing System (RAIDS), Raytheon&#x27;s Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF) system and the Paveway guided bombs. The Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod (DJRP) was added as part of Capability D.

In February 2007, handling trials of the MBDA Brimstone (missile) began, however the Brimstone would remain uncleared for deployment on the GR9 by the type&#x27;s early retirement. The Sniper targeting pod replaced the less accurate TIALD in 2007, under an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) for Afghanistan. Capability E would have included a Link 16 communications link, an auxiliary communications system, and a Tactical Information Exchange Capability (TIEC) system that was planned to by deployed on both the Harrier II and the Tornado GR4. In July 2007, BAE Systems completed the final of seven Harrier GR9 replacement rear fuselages for the MoD. The fuselage components were designed and built as part of a three-year £20 million programme. In July 2008, Qinetiq was awarded a contract to perform upgrades and maintain the Harrier II fleet until 2018, which was the predicted out of service date for the type.

==Operational history==

===Combat duties===
The first squadrons to receive the Harrier II were based in Royal Air Force Germany, a standing force maintained to deter Soviet aggression against the West and, in the event of war, to carry out ground attacks. As the Harrier II had significantly greater range and survivability than its predecessor the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, a new emphasis was placed on interdiction operations. By the end of 1990, the Harrier II was approaching full operational status with several squadrons. During the 1991 Gulf War, the Harrier II was considered to be too immature to be deployed. However, several aircraft were dispatched to patrol no-fly zones over Iraq from 1993 onwards. In 1994, the last of the RAF&#x27;s first generation Harriers was retired, the Harrier II having taken over its duties.

In 1995, hostilities between ethnic Croatians and Serbians in the aftermath of the collapse of Yugoslavia led to the dispatch of NATO forces to the region as a deterrent to further escalations in violence. A squadron of Harrier IIs was stationed at Gioia del Colle Air Base in Italy, relieving an earlier deployment of RAF SEPECAT Jaguars. Both attack and reconnaissance missions were carried out by the Harriers, which had been quickly modified to integrate GPS navigation for operations in the theatre. More than 126 strike sorties were carried out by Harrier IIs, often assisted by Jaguar fighter-bombers acting as designators for laser-guided bombs such as the Paveway II. Bosnia was reportedly the first air campaign in which the majority of ordnance expended was precision-guided.

In June 1994, the newly introduced GR7 was deployed for trials on board the Navy&#x27;s s. Operational naval deployments began in 1997. The capability soon proved useful: in 1998, a deployment was conducted to Iraq via aircraft carriers stationed in the Persian Gulf. In 2000, &#x27;presence&#x27; and reconnaissance sorties over Sierra Leone were performed by carrier-based Harrier GR7s and Royal Navy Sea Harrier FA2s. The &quot;Invincible&quot;-class carriers also received multiple adaptations for greater compatibility with the Harrier II, including changes to the communications, lighting and flight deck.

Cooperative operations between the two services was formalised under the Joint Force Harrier (JFH) command organisation, which was brought about following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. Under JFH, RAF Harrier IIs would routinely operate alongside the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Harriers. The main JFH operating base was RAF Cottesmore, a great emphasis was placed on inter-service interaction across the organisation. The combined Joint Force Harrier served as the basis for future expeditionary warfare and naval deployments. In the long term, JFH also served as a pilot scheme for the joint operation of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

During Operation Allied Force, the NATO mission over Kosovo in 1999, the RAF contribution included 16 Panavia Tornados and 12 Harrier GR7s. On 27 April 1999, during a mission to attack a Serbian military depot, RAF Harriers came under heavy anti-aircraft fire, but did not suffer losses as a result. In April 1999, the rules of engagement were changed to allow Harriers to use GPS navigation and targeting during medium-altitude bombing missions. A total of 870 Harrier II sorties were carried out during the 78-day bombing campaign. The BBC reported the Harrier II had been achieving 80% direct hit rate during the conflict; a later Parliamentary Select Committee found that 24% of munitions expended in the theatre by all RAF aircraft had been precision weapons.

In 2003, the Harrier GR7 played a prominent role during Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the U.S.-led Iraq War. When war broke out, Harriers flew reconnaissance and strike missions inside Southern Iraq, reportedly to destroy Scud missile launchers to prevent their use against neighbouring Kuwait. Prior to the war, the Harriers had been equipped with a new armament, the AGM-65 Maverick missile, which reportedly was a noticeable contribution to the Harrier&#x27;s operations over Iraq; a total of 38 Mavericks were launched during the campaign.

During the Battle of Basra, a key Iraqi city, Harriers conducted multiple strike missions against Iraqi fuel depots to cripple enemy ground vehicles; other priority targets for the Harriers included tanks, boats, and artillery. According to Nordeen, roughly 30 per cent of all RAF Harrier operations were close air support missions, supporting advancing allied ground troops. In April 2003, the Ministry of Defence admitted that RAF Harriers had deployed controversial RBL755 cluster bombs in Iraq. Both the British and American Harrier squadrons were withdrawn from operations in Iraq during Summer 2003.
RAF Harriers would be a regular element of Britain&#x27;s contribution to the War in Afghanistan. In September 2004, six Harrier GR7s were deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan, replacing a US detachment of AV-8Bs in the region. On 14 October 2005, a Harrier GR7A was destroyed and another was damaged while parked on the tarmac at Kandahar by a Taliban rocket attack. No one was injured in the attack; the damaged Harrier was repaired, while the destroyed aircraft was replaced.

While initial operations in Afghanistan had focused on intimidation and reconnaissance, demand for interdiction missions using the Harrier II spiked dramatically during the Helmand province campaign. Between July and September 2006, the theatre total for munitions deployed by British Harriers on planned operations and close air support to ground forces rose from 179 to 539, the majority being CRV-7 rockets. The Harrier IIs had also switched to 24-hour availability, having formerly operated mostly during the day.

In January 2007, the Harrier GR9 began its first operational deployment at Kandahar, as part of the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF); Harrier GR7s would be progressively withdrawn in favour of the newer Harrier GR9. Following five years of continuous operations in Afghanistan, the last of Britain&#x27;s Harriers were withdrawn from the Afghan theatre in June 2009, having flown over 22,000 hours on 8,500 sorties, they were replaced by several RAF Tornado GR4s.

===Rundown===
In 2005, allegations emerged in Parliament that, following the transfer of servicing duties to RAF Cottesmore, the standard and quality of maintenance on the Harrier fleet had fallen dramatically; several airframes had been considerably damaged and one likely destroyed due to mistakes made, the time taken to perform the servicing had risen from 100 days to 155 days, and the cost per aircraft had also risen to more than ten times that of the prior arrangements performed by Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA).

In 2006, the Sea Harrier was retired from Fleet Air Arm service and the Harrier GR7/9 fleet was tasked with the missions that it used to share with those aircraft. The former Sea Harrier squadron 800 Naval Air Squadron reformed with ex-RAF Harrier GR7/9s in April 2006 and joined by the re-formed 801 Naval Air Squadron in 2007. These later expanded and become the Naval Strike Wing. On 31 March 2010, No. 20 Squadron RAF, the Harrier Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), was disbanded; No. 4 Squadron also disbanded and reformed as No. 4 (Reserve) Squadron at RAF Wittering. All Harrier GR7 aircraft were retired by July 2010.
The Harrier GR9 was expected to stay in service at least until 2018. However, on 19 October 2010 it was announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review that the Harrier was to be retired by April 2011. In the long term, the F-35B Lightning II, would operate from the Navy&#x27;s two new s. The decision to retire the Harrier was controversial, with some senior officers calling for the Panavia Tornado to be retired as an alternative; the decision having left Britain without any fixed-wing aircraft capable of flying from the navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers.

On 24 November 2010, the Harrier made its last ever flight from a carrier, incidentally also the last flight from the carrier prior to retirement. The fleet&#x27;s last operational flights occurred on 15 December 2010 with fly pasts over numerous military bases. In November 2011, the Ministry of Defence sold 72 Harrier IIs, along with spare parts, to the United States Marine Corps for £116 million (US$180 million); the aircraft to be used as a source of components for the AV-8B Harrier II fleet.

According to a report by &quot;Air Forces Monthly&quot;, some of the 72 Harrier IIs were to fly again, as the USMC planned to equip two squadrons with GR.9/9A models due to the well-maintained condition of the airframes when inspected at RAF Cottesmore, where the aircraft were stored and maintained by a skeleton crew of technicians following their retirement. This was contradicted by the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in June 2012, who stated that the USMC never planned to operate ex-RAF Harriers.

==Variants==

;GR.5
:The GR5 was the RAF&#x27;s first model of the second-generation Harrier. The GR5 considerably differed from the USMC AV-8B in terms of avionics, armaments and countermeasures. Forty one GR5s were built.

;GR.5A
:The GR5A was a minor variant, incorporating design changes in anticipation of the GR7 upgrade. Twenty-one GR5As were built.

;GR.7
:The GR7 is an upgraded model of the GR5. The first GR7 conducted its maiden flight in May 1990, and made its first operational deployment in August 1995 over the former Yugoslavia.

;GR.7A
:The GR7A feature an uprated Pegasus 107 engine. GR7As upgraded to GR9 standard retain the A designation as GR9As. The Mk 107 engine provides around 3,000 lbf (13 kN) extra thrust over the Mk 105&#x27;s 21,750 lbf (98 kN) thrust.

;GR.9
:The GR9 is an upgrade of the GR7, focused on the Harrier II&#x27;s avionics and weapons. Upgraded under the JUMP programme.

;GR.9A
:The Harrier GR9A is an avionics and weapons upgrade of the uprated engined GR7As. All GR9s were capable of accepting the Mk 107 Pegasus engine to become GR9As.

;T.10
:The Harrier T10 is the first two seat training variant of the Harrier II; based on the USMC Harrier trainer the TAV-8B. Unlike their American counterparts, the T10s are fully combat-capable.

;T.12
:Update of the trainers to accompany the GR9. Nine T10 aircraft received the JUMP updates under the designation T12, however these would retain the less powerful Pegasus 105 engine.

;T.12A
:Equivalent to the T.12, however differs by being equipped with the newer and more powerful Mk 107 Pegasus engine of the GR7A/9A.

<doc id="825716" wikidata="Q302391" url="?curid=825716" title="One Heart">
<text>One Heart is the nineteenth studio album and eighth English-language album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music on 24 March 2003. It was promoted by the lead single &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;. &quot;One Heart&quot; was produced mainly by Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, Peer Åström, Anders Bagge, and Kristian Lundin. It topped the charts in various countries and was certified multi-platinum, platinum, and gold around the world. &quot;One Heart&quot; has sold over five million copies worldwide.

==Background and content==
The release of this album marked the beginning of &quot;A New Day...&quot;, Dion&#x27;s five-year concert arrangement in The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

&quot;One Heart&quot; contains songs produced by Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, Peer Åström, Anders Bagge, Ric Wake, Kristian Lundin, Kara DioGuardi, John Shanks, Guy Roche, and others. It includes a cover of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, made famous by Cyndi Lauper. Another song, &quot;Reveal&quot;, was written by Cathy Dennis, who also wrote &quot;Toxic&quot; for Britney Spears and &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; for Kylie Minogue, among others. &quot;Sorry for Love (2003 version)&quot; is actually an original version of the song. The dance version was released a year earlier on &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;. Already available on the &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; 2002 special limited edition, &quot;Coulda Woulda Shoulda&quot; was included here as well. &quot;One Heart&quot; also features &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, taken from &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;. The last track on the album, &quot;Je t&#x27;aime encore&quot;, was recorded also in French and included on Dion&#x27;s next album, &quot;1 fille &amp; 4 types&quot;.

In June 2004, a bonus DVD called &quot;One Year... One Heart&quot; was included on some editions of &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot;, containing the recording of &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot; and the making of &quot;One Heart&quot; music video among other features.

==Promotion==
In the United States, &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, &quot;One Heart&quot;, and &quot;Love Is All We Need&quot; were used from 2003 to 2004 in an advertising campaign for DaimlerChrysler, and the CD&#x27;s inlay cover had the Chrysler logo and slogan.

==Singles==
&quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was chosen as the leadoff single and became a hit, reaching number one in Canada, Belgium and Sweden. Although &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot; was already featured on Dion&#x27;s previous album &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, it was released as the second single from &quot;One Heart&quot; in the United States and third in selected countries. It was successful on the Adult Contemporary charts in the US and Canada, reaching number two and three, respectively. The title track promoted the album as the second single outside the United States, and reached top forty in various countries, including number twenty-seven in the United Kingdom. There were also two radio releases at the end of 2003: &quot;Stand by Your Side&quot; in the US and &quot;Faith&quot; in Canada.

==Critical response==

The album received mainly mixed reviews from most music critics. AllMusic&#x27;s senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it two-and-a-half stars out of possible five, writing that the collaboration with Britney Spears&#x27;s producer Max Martin in three tracks was a sign of &quot;desperation that underscores every minute of &quot;One Heart&quot;, where it seems like Dion will do anything to stay on the charts&quot;. Erlewine also wrote that &quot;&quot;One Heart&quot; favors a smooth Vegas-showstopper gloss to radio-ready sheen, which only accentuates the lack of cohesiveness here&quot; and that the album &quot;reveals all her weaknesses&quot;. Chuck Arnold of &quot;People&quot; wrote a mixed review towards the album&#x27;s songs, calling it &quot;a bit jarring at times&quot; and that &quot;Dion sounds so strangely subdued on some tracks, you keep waiting for her to really let rip&quot;. Either way, he wrote positively that &quot;There is a lightness to &quot;One Heart&quot; that has been missing from much of Dion&#x27;s previous work, as she leans more toward upbeat dance numbers, easy-listening rock and even borderline country-pop&quot;.

Entertainment.ie&#x27;s Andrew Lynch was more negative, writing that &quot;The problem is, Dion&#x27;s songwriters seem to have been under strict instructions to keep the material as bland as possible. And while her glass-shattering voice is as spectacular as ever, she still doesn&#x27;t sound as if she believes a word of what she&#x27;s singing. &quot;One Heart&quot; is certainly one of her better collections - but frankly, that isn&#x27;t saying very much&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Betty Clarke wrote that &quot;Dion proves she can be more than a series of hollow - if album-shifting - sentiments&quot;. Darryl Sterdan wrote a very negative review for Jam!, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s bad enough the 14-song CD is full of unoriginal, instantly forgettable fluff -- leftover Britney bubble-pop from Max Martin, cliche chest-pounding power ballads, a title cut that&#x27;s a blatant Shania soundalike and a Cher-style Eurodisco revamp of the Roy Orbison hit &quot;I Drove All Night,&quot; which she&#x27;s already turned into a Chrysler jingle&quot;.

Instead of the mixed and negative reviews, a positive review came from Amazon&#x27;s Rebecca Wallwork, who praised Dion for &quot;an unrelenting theme of joy and believing in one&#x27;s self&quot; and highlighted the album for &quot;being both well timed and well executed&quot;. But she revealed that &quot;it contains no surprises, but then, besides her voice, that&#x27;s one of Dion&#x27;s biggest assets&quot;. In a more positive review, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Elisabeth Vincentelli questioned &quot;why Celine get so little respect?&quot; and later went to praise the album for &quot;Dion&#x27;s uncanny ability to infuse sincerity into aural Hallmark cards and sound like the only person on earth who believes in true love&quot;. In the end, she wrote: &quot;And in our age of postmodern ironists, isn&#x27;t it refreshing to encounter someone who so genuinely loves her job?&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Sal Cinquemani praised &quot;the album as a whole&quot;, saying that &quot;she continues the restrained approach of her last record, both in production and performance&quot;. He finished the review, noting that &quot;&quot;One Heart&quot; may be the smartest album Dion could make at this stage in her career&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the album by concluding: &quot;&quot;One Heart&quot; may not crackle with the noise of an &quot;event&quot; record, but it succeeds at something far more important: It is a fine piece of music&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In Canada, &quot;One Heart&quot; shot to the top of the chart, selling 97,000 copies in its first week, making it the biggest debut of the year. It spent eight weeks inside top ten of the Canadian Albums Chart and was certified three-times Platinum by the CRIA for shipment of 300,000 units. In France, &quot;One Heart&quot; also debuted at number one and remained at the top for two weeks. It was certified Platinum in July 2003 for sales of 300,000 copies. &quot;One Heart&quot; also entered the charts at the top position in Denmark and Belgium Flanders. In both countries, it stayed at number one for a second week. It was certified Platinum in Denmark and Gold in Belgium. The album also topped the chart in Switzerland, where it achieved Platinum status. &quot;One Heart&quot; topped the chart in Greece as well, and was certified Gold there. It became a top ten album in many other European countries, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number four, was certified Gold, and has sold over 204,000 copies. On the European Top 100 Albums, &quot;One Heart&quot; reached number two, and was certified Platinum by the IFPI for selling over one million copies in Europe.

In the United States, &quot;One Heart&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number two, selling 432,000 copies. The next week, it fell to number four, selling 166,000 units. In the third week, &quot;One Heart&quot; occupied the number eight position with sales of 117,000 copies. Later, it fell to number eleven, selling another 116,000 units. In April 2003, &quot;One Heart&quot; was certified two-times Platinum by the RIAA for shipment of two million copies in the US. The album also reached top ten in Australia and New Zealand, and achieved Platinum status in both countries. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, One Heart was the tenth best-selling album in the first half of 2003, selling 1.3 million in that span. According to the IFPI, &quot;One Heart&quot; became the tenth best-selling album around the world in 2003. It has sold over five million copies worldwide.

==Accolades==

<text>Ivy King was the largest pure-fission nuclear bomb ever tested by the United States. The bomb was tested during the Truman administration as part of Operation Ivy. This series of tests involved the development of very powerful nuclear weapons in response to the nuclear weapons program of the Soviet Union.

The production of Ivy King was hurried to be ready in case its sister project, Ivy Mike, failed in its attempt to achieve a thermonuclear reaction. The Ivy King test actually took place two weeks after the Mike test. Unlike the Mike bomb, the Ivy King device could theoretically have been added to United States&#x27; nuclear arsenal, because it was designed to be air-deliverable.

On November 16, 1952 at 11:30 local time (23:30 GMT) a B-36H bomber dropped the bomb over a point north of Runit Island in the Enewetak atoll, resulting in a 500 kiloton explosion at . The tropopause height at the time of the detonation was about . The top of the King cloud reached about with the mushroom base at about .

The Ivy King bomb, designated as a Mk-18 bomb and named the &quot;Super Oralloy Bomb&quot;, was a modified version of the Mk-6D bomb. Instead of using an implosion system similar to the Mk-6D, it used a 92-point implosion system initially developed for the Mk-13. Its uranium-plutonium core was replaced by 60 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fashioned into a thin-walled sphere equivalent to approximately four critical masses. The thin-walled sphere was a commonly used design, which ensured that the fissile material remained sub-critical until imploded. The HEU sphere was then enclosed in a natural-uranium tamper. To physically prevent the HEU sphere collapsing into a critical condition if the surrounding explosives were detonated accidentally, or if the sphere was crushed following an aircraft accident, the hollow center was filled with a chain made from aluminum and boron, which was pulled out to arm the bomb. The boron-coated chain also absorbed the neutrons needed to drive the nuclear reaction.

The primary designer of the Super Oralloy Bomb, physicist Ted Taylor, later became a vocal proponent of nuclear disarmament.

With an explosive yield of 500 kilotons, Ivy King is the second largest known fission-only device ever tested after the Orange Herald nuclear device, a 720-kiloton atomic bomb tested by the United Kingdom on 31 May 1957, which remains to date the largest fission device ever tested.

<doc id="825728" wikidata="Q1824576" url="?curid=825728" title="A New Day Has Come">
<text>A New Day Has Come is the eighteenth studio album and seventh English-language album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music on 25 March 2002. It was her first new studio album since her 1998 Christmas album &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;. Dion returned to the music scene after a two-year hiatus when she gave birth to her first child in 2001. She collaborated on &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; with various producers, including Anders Bagge and Peer Åström for the first time.

&quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a &quot;broader, more adventurous&quot; range of pop music and &quot;dips its toe&quot; into modern music, particularly dance-pop (&quot;Sorry for Love&quot;). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like &quot;I Surrender&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, and the title track. Critics also praised &quot;Ten Days&quot;, &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, &quot;When the Wrong One Loves You Right&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Reward&quot;, and the album&#x27;s two covers: &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and &quot;At Last&quot;.

&quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; became a commercial success throughout the world and entered number one in more than seventeen countries. It has sold 3.3 million units in the United States and was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping 600,000 copies, the album was certified six-times Platinum. The IFPI certified it three-times Platinum for selling three million units in Europe. Overall, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; has sold 12 million copies worldwide.

The first single, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, was released in March 2002 and peaked inside the top ten in Canada and Europe. In the United States, it reached number twenty-two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and broke the record for most weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, staying on top for twenty-one weeks. The next single, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, was issued in August 2002 and also peaked inside the top ten in numerous European countries. The last commercial single, &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot; was released in November 2002 and performed moderately on the charts, reaching the top forty in Europe.

==Background==
After the farewell millennium concert on 31 December 1999 in Montreal, Dion decided to take a break from the public scene for two years to focus on her family. On 25 January 2001, she gave birth to René-Charles Angelil, her first son. Since then, she had performed publicly only a handful of times, including 21 September 2001, when she sang a live rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot; at the &quot;&quot; telethon honoring victims of the September 11 attacks, and 28 September for Montreal&#x27;s companion fund-raiser, &quot;A Show for Life&quot;, singing &quot;L&#x27;amour existe encore&quot;.

According to Dion, the album&#x27;s title, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, acknowledged a new chapter in her life and career. However, she was also deeply affected by the events of 11 September and wanted the words to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. &quot;It represents my child, because I gave life,&quot; Dion said. &quot;Obviously, it also marks my return with a new album. But a new day has also come in the lives of other people because something bad has happened, because we&#x27;ve lost lives, because there&#x27;s a scar on our world now&quot;. Dion struggled over an appropriate image for the cover of the album, feeling that a portrait reflecting her good fortune was in poor taste. She suggested to Sony Music Entertainment that the album cover not include her picture. However, after much discussion, the photo shoot for &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; took place in Montreal in late December 2001 with well-renowned photographer Melvin Sokolsky. On 30 and 31 January 2002 an additional photo session for the album took place in Florida, on a beach near Dion&#x27;s home by the French photographer Patrick Demarchelier. The album cover for &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; by Demarchelier was released on 28 February 2002.

René Angélil, Dion, and the Sony family began selecting prospective songs at the beginning of 2001, and on 28 August 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal&#x27;s Piccolo Studios. Because of Dion&#x27;s unwillingness to leave her seven-month-old baby, the album&#x27;s collaborators traveled to Montreal. &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel the pressure to try and outdo anything,&quot; Dion said of her time in the studio. &quot;I proved myself before, so now I can enjoy. I was relaxed, I just let go. It was such a pleasure&quot;. The album was scheduled for release internationally on 25 March 2002 and in North America on 26 March 2002.

==Content==
Most of the producers of the album had worked with Dion before: Walter Afanasieff, Kristian Lundin, Andreas Carlsson, Christopher Neil, Guy Roche, Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, Ric Wake, Aldo Nova, Simon Franglen and Humberto Gatica. The new ones included Swedish musicians Anders Bagge, Peer Åström and Arnthor Birgisson, French singer Gérald de Palmas and the US producer Steve Morales. &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; showcases Dion&#x27;s traditional themes of love and hope. She sings ballads alongside several uptempo pop tracks and a pair of standards. The album contains sixteen tracks on the North American version and seventeen on the international editions, including &quot;Super Love&quot;.

It features &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, the title track, which for Dion represents the birth of her child but &quot;it can mean different things for anyone who has to find strength again&quot;; I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;fresh&quot; song from the team that wrote &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;; &quot;I Surrender&quot;, the album&#x27;s &quot;bombastic, heart-pounding&quot; ballad which has become a popular song choice for contestants on reality television singing competitions like &quot;American Idol&quot;; &quot;Sorry for Love&quot;, a dance number written and produced by the Swedish team, co-written by Kara DioGuardi; &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, a power ballad also written and produced by Bagge and Åström; &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, an emotional ballad about the death of one&#x27;s mother which Dion first heard three years prior but turned it down at that time; &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, a 1947 song made popular by Nat King Cole that features Dion accompanied only by piano as originally foreseen symphonic orchestration was not added; &quot;At Last&quot;, a gospel-tinged number first recorded by Glenn Miller in 1941; &quot;Ten Days&quot;, a rock-oriented adaptation of &quot;Tomber&quot; (2000) by Gérald de Palmas which was recorded at the last minute after Dion heard the original French version; &quot;The Greatest Reward&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;L&#x27;envie d&#x27;aimer&quot; (2000) from the French musical &quot;Les Dix Commandements&quot;, performed originally by Daniel Lévi; and &quot;Aun Existe Amor&quot;, a Spanish-language version of Dion&#x27;s French song &quot;L&#x27;amour existe encore&quot;.

===Special editions===
On 11 November 2002 in Europe and 19 November 2002 in North America, Sony Music Entertainment released a Limited Edition of &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, which includes the original album, as well as a bonus DVD featuring the &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; video, a preview of Dion&#x27;s Las Vegas show &quot;A New Day...&quot; as well as two previously unreleased tracks, &quot;Coulda Woulda Shoulda&quot; and &quot;All Because of You&quot;. The North American Limited Edition includes a longer version of &quot;The Greatest Reward&quot; lasting 4:04, instead of original 3:28. On 29 January 2008, Legacy Recordings released a Collector&#x27;s Edition of &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; with bonus DVD. The CD contains sixteen tracks from the North American version of the album, including an extended version of &quot;The Greatest Reward&quot;, and the DVD features four music videos, and behind the scenes footage from making of the album and the &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; video.

==Promotion==
Dion actively promoted the album, including various television show appearances and concerts. Her &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; television special was taped on 3 March 2002 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles and aired on CBS on 7 April 2002. During the show Dion performed &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, &quot;At Last&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and a movie medley with the songs &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in duet with Brian McKnight and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. She also sang &quot;Aun Existe Amor&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, but both songs were not broadcast.

The concert was broadcast live on VH1 on 23 May 2002 to benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting music and education programs in schools.

==Singles==
The first single, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; premiered on the radio on 6 February 2002. The music video was shot in mid-February 2002 in West Palm Beach, Florida and directed by Dave Meyers. It premiered on 13 March 2002 and the CD single was released outside the United States at the same time. &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; became a top ten hit in Canada and Europe, including number seven in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was released as an airplay-only track, which led to its peak position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number twenty-two. However, on the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, the song broke the record for most weeks at number one, staying on top for twenty-one weeks.

Also directed by Meyers, the music video for next single, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; was filmed in late May 2002 in Los Angeles and the song was serviced to radio stations on 7 June 2002. At the same time, two remixes of &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; premiered: Humberto Gatica Mix and The Wake Up Mix. The music video debuted on 27 June 2002. &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; was also featured in the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; and the CD single was released in early August 2002 in Europe, Australia and Canada. The song peaked inside the top ten in various European countries which led to its number two position on the European Hot 100 Singles. In the United States, it reached number six on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks.

The third and last commercial single, &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot; was released to radio on 10 October 2002. The music video was filmed in the Château d&#x27;Aunoy castle in France in mid-October 2002 and directed by Chris Applebaum. It premiered on 21 November 2002 and the CD single was released at the same time in Europe, reaching the top forty in various countries. On the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot; peaked at number twenty-seven.

Sony Music Entertainment also released two promotional singles in the United States: &quot;Aun Existe Amor&quot; and &quot;At Last&quot;. The first one was issued after Dion performed the song at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards in May 2002 where she was honoured with a special award for &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, which was the first English-language song to top &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin Tracks chart. &quot;At Last&quot; was sent to the adult contemporary radio stations in December 2002 and peaked at number sixteen on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Although not changed, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot; was also included on Dion&#x27;s next album, &quot;One Heart&quot; and released as a single in April 2003. The song spent fourteen weeks at number two on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States.

==Critical reception==
The album garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Chuck Taylor from &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a favorable review, saying that Dion explores a &quot;broader, more adventurous&quot; range of pop music. Among the highlights, he mentioned &quot;Sorry for Love&quot; where Dion &quot;dishes out her first all-out dance anthem&quot; and holds a twelve-second &quot;authentic note that puts the &quot;d&quot; in diva&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; and &quot;When the Wrong One Loves You Right&quot;, which he described as &quot;hitworthy uptempo gems&quot;, the rock-leaning &quot;Ten Days&quot;, and a Spanish track, &quot;Aun Existe Amor&quot;. According to Taylor, Dion does not disappoint with ballads like the &quot;rafter-shaking&quot; &quot;I Surrender&quot; where she sings of &quot;forbidden love amid a firestorm of utterly volcanic instrumentation&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Reward&quot;, and two standards – the &quot;diamond-dipped&quot; &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and gospel &quot;At Last&quot;. He called the album the most &quot;versatile and gratifying&quot; Dion&#x27;s recording yet. Larry Flick, also from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote about another song, &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot; that &quot;at a time when music is frightfully aggressive and the world at large is fraught with turmoil, a classic Dion power ballad is a warm source of comfort&quot;. The track &quot;builds from a gentle, piano-laced opening into a deliciously theatrical, string-framed climax&quot;. All along, Dion offers an &quot;appealing palette of vocal colors that range from delicate and breathy to full-bodied and appropriately dramatic&quot;.

Chuck Taylor also reviewed all three singles from the album. He wrote that the life-affirming &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; &quot;comes off like a gentle exhale against the world&#x27;s ills&quot;. The Ric Wake Radio Remix of &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; opens with an &quot;Enya-inspired whisper before a shuffle skips in and lifts the song upward like a dove gracefully taking flight&quot;. The Album Edit &quot;comes sans the beat, allowing Dion&#x27;s performance alone to fully color the message&quot;. According to him, on both versions Dion &quot;embraces a particularly restrained performance – dramatic enough to steer the track&#x27;s emotion, but still delicate to offer comfort&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; demonstrates a stylistic &quot;left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion&quot;. The &quot;percolating&quot; Humberto Gatica Mix &quot;adds juice&quot; to the Album Version, while the uptempo Wake Up Mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion&#x27;s most &quot;inspired and festive&quot; remix to date, with Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; woven into the beat to &quot;splendid effect&quot;. Taylor criticized the choice of the third single, &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, a ballad relegated solely to adult contemporary radio stations. He noticed that the song is &quot;devastatingly beautiful&quot;, offering a loving tribute to one&#x27;s mother at death&#x27;s door and that Dion &quot;delivers it with a heaving helping of passion, emotionally drawing one&#x27;s attention to the devotional message&quot;. Although he felt that many will connect to the loss of a parent, on a commercial level, this was a disappointing decision. According to Taylor, songs like &quot;Sorry for Love&quot; and &quot;When the Wrong One Loves You Right&quot; were primed for radio airplay and dancefloor remixes and were ideal candidates for release.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars saying that its construction is &quot;as perfect as it could be&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;deviate&quot; from Dion&#x27;s mainstream audience, yet it &quot;dips its toe&quot; into modern music, particularly dance, while &quot;keeping hip&quot; (&quot;Nature Boy&quot;). Although Erlewine described &quot;Rain, Tax (It&#x27;s Inevitable)&quot; as &quot;bizarre&quot;, he wrote that &quot;there&#x27;s really nothing to fault it on, actually,&quot; the album is &quot;more ambitious than it needs to be, covers more stylistic territory than any other Dion record, while never abandoning the middle-of-the-road; it&#x27;s a balancing act that nobody since Barbra Streisand has been able to pull off&quot;. According to Erlewine, the songs aren&#x27;t &quot;that particularly memorable&quot;, &quot;the mood shifts effortlessly, it never seems to stay in one place,&quot; but it &quot;never catches hold, either&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; three out of five stars. According to him, Dion is great at what she does and &quot;if she ever tried anything too edgy she&#x27;d probably just sound foolish&quot;. Cinquemani disliked &quot;Rain, Tax (It&#x27;s Inevitable)&quot; but praised &quot;Sorry for Love&quot; on which Dion &quot;gets the Cher treatment&quot;, an unexpected &quot;change of pace that actually works&quot;. Among other highlights he mentioned two covers, a &quot;soulful&quot; rendition of &quot;At Last&quot; and a &quot;simple and moving&quot; arrangement of &quot;Nature Boy&quot;. He also noticed that the album is &quot;packed&quot; with the usual adult contemporary songs: &quot;I Surrender&quot;, a power ballad &quot;only a singer with Dion&#x27;s voice could pull off,&quot; &quot;Ten Days&quot;, the guitar-driven &quot;catchy pop-rocker with a surprisingly edgy vocal,&quot; &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, a track featuring Shania Twain on backing vocals that &quot;will leave you nauseous or in tears&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, the &quot;uplifting&quot; midtempo number and &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, the &quot;stirring&quot; title track.

Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album B−. He felt that &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; was &quot;over-arranged&quot; by producers, which works &quot;against Dion&#x27;s enthusiasm for the wonders of babies and innocence&quot;. Nevertheless, he praised the &quot;jaunty disco&quot; of &quot;Sorry for Love&quot;, and &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot; which &quot;builds in intensity to sound like &quot;a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand&quot;. Tucker described &quot;Rain, Tax (It&#x27;s Inevitable)&quot; as the most &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; and &quot;idiomatic&quot; song that Dion has ever recorded. According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; &quot;picks up where &quot;Falling into You&quot; left off&quot;. Dion&#x27;s album is a full of &quot;bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she&#x27;s ever done&quot;. Attempts at modernity are &quot;spotty&quot;, though &quot;welcome&quot;. Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, with &quot;two soaring key changes&quot; in the same song, which is then launched into a &quot;high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy&quot;. Barnes &amp; Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;edgier&quot; Dion. They praised the &quot;uplifting&quot; title track, &quot;heartfelt, country-tinged&quot; &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;, &quot;anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad&quot; &quot;Prayer&quot;, &quot;bluesy, honky-tonk rocker&quot; &quot;Ten Days&quot;, &quot;soaring ballad&quot; &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love&quot;, and &quot;solid renditions&quot; of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and &quot;At Last&quot;.

It was certified six-times Platinum by the CRIA. &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; topped the charts in most European countries and was certified Multi-Platinum, Platinum and Gold. After selling three million copies in Europe and spending seven weeks at number-one on the European Top 100 Albums, it was certified three-times Platinum by the IFPI. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; as the 3rd Top Album of 2002 in Europe (behind Shakira&#x27;s Laundry Service &amp; Anastacia&#x27;s Freak of Nature). &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; also peaked at number-one in Australia and New Zealand and was certified two-times Platinum in both countries.

The album entered number one in more than seventeen countries, becoming the biggest debut of 2002. The commercial success of &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; led to its fifth position on the list of best selling albums of 2002, according to the IFPI. It has sold 12 million copies worldwide.

<text>Verlet integration () is a numerical method used to integrate Newton&#x27;s equations of motion. It is frequently used to calculate trajectories of particles in molecular dynamics simulations and computer graphics. The algorithm was first used in 1791 by Jean Baptiste Delambre and has been rediscovered many times since then, most recently by Loup Verlet in the 1960s for use in molecular dynamics. It was also used by P. H. Cowell and A. C. C. Crommelin in 1909 to compute the orbit of Halley&#x27;s Comet, and by Carl Størmer in 1907 to study the trajectories of electrical particles in a magnetic field (hence it is also called Størmer&#x27;s method).
The Verlet integrator provides good numerical stability, as well as other properties that are important in physical systems such as time reversibility and preservation of the symplectic form on phase space, at no significant additional computational cost over the simple Euler method.

==Basic Størmer–Verlet==

For a second-order differential equation of the type formula_1 with initial conditions formula_2 and formula_3, an approximate numerical solution formula_4 at the times formula_5 with step size formula_6 can be obtained by the following method:
# set formula_7,
# for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, ... iterate formula_8

===Equations of motion===
Newton&#x27;s equation of motion for conservative physical systems is
:formula_9
or individually
:formula_10
where
* formula_11 is the time,
* formula_12 is the ensemble of the position vector of formula_13 objects,
* formula_14 is the scalar potential function,
* formula_15 is the negative gradient of the potential, giving the ensemble of forces on the particles,
* formula_16 is the mass matrix, typically diagonal with blocks with mass formula_17 for every particle.

This equation, for various choices of the potential function formula_14, can be used to describe the evolution of diverse physical systems, from the motion of interacting molecules to the orbit of the planets.

After a transformation to bring the mass to the right side and forgetting the structure of multiple particles, the equation may be simplified to
:formula_1
with some suitable vector-valued function formula_20 representing the position-dependent acceleration. Typically, an initial position formula_21 and an initial velocity formula_22 are also given.

===Verlet integration (without velocities)===
To discretize and numerically solve this initial value problem, a time step formula_6 is chosen, and the sampling-point sequence formula_24 considered. The task is to construct a sequence of points formula_25 that closely follow the points formula_26 on the trajectory of the exact solution.

Where Euler&#x27;s method uses the forward difference approximation to the first derivative in differential equations of order one, Verlet integration can be seen as using the central difference approximation to the second derivative:
:formula_27

&quot;Verlet integration&quot; in the form used as the &quot;Størmer method&quot; uses this equation to obtain the next position vector from the previous two without using the velocity as
:formula_28

===Discretisation error===
The time symmetry inherent in the method reduces the level of local errors introduced into the integration by the discretization by removing all odd-degree terms, here the terms in formula_29 of degree three. The local error is quantified by inserting the exact values formula_30 into the iteration and computing the Taylor expansions at time formula_31 of the position vector formula_32 in different time directions:
:formula_33
where formula_34 is the position, formula_35 the velocity, formula_36 the acceleration, and formula_37 the jerk (third derivative of the position with respect to the time).

Adding these two expansions gives
:formula_38
We can see that the first- and third-order terms from the Taylor expansion cancel out, thus making the Verlet integrator an order more accurate than integration by simple Taylor expansion alone.

Caution should be applied to the fact that the acceleration here is computed from the exact solution, formula_39, whereas in the iteration it is computed at the central iteration point, formula_40. In computing the global error, that is the distance between exact solution and approximation sequence, those two terms do not cancel exactly, influencing the order of the global error.

===A simple example===

To gain insight into the relation of local and global errors, it is helpful to examine simple examples where the exact solution, as well as the approximate solution, can be expressed in explicit formulas. The standard example for this task is the exponential function.

Consider the linear differential equation formula_41 with a constant formula_42. Its exact basis solutions are formula_43 and formula_44.

The Størmer method applied to this differential equation leads to a linear recurrence relation
:formula_45
or
:formula_46
It can be solved by finding the roots of its characteristic polynomial
formula_47. These are
:formula_48
The basis solutions of the linear recurrence are formula_49 and formula_50. To compare them with the exact solutions, Taylor expansions are computed:
:formula_51
The quotient of this series with the one of the exponential formula_52 starts with formula_53, so
:formula_54
From there it follows that for the first basis solution the error can be computed as
:formula_55
That is, although the local discretization error is of order 4, due to the second order of the differential equation the global error is of order 2, with a constant that grows exponentially in time.

===Starting the iteration===
Note that at the start of the Verlet iteration at step formula_56, time formula_57, computing formula_58, one already needs the position vector formula_59 at time formula_60. At first sight, this could give problems, because the initial conditions are known only at the initial time formula_61. However, from these the acceleration formula_62 is known, and a suitable approximation for the position at the first time step can be obtained using the Taylor polynomial of degree two:
:formula_63

The error on the first time step then is of order formula_64. This is not considered a problem because on a simulation over a large number of time steps, the error on the first time step is only a negligibly small amount of the total error, which at time formula_65 is of the order formula_66, both for the distance of the position vectors formula_25 to formula_26 as for the distance of the divided differences formula_69 to formula_70. Moreover, to obtain this second-order global error, the initial error needs to be of at least third order.

===Non-constant time differences===
A disadvantage of the Størmer–Verlet method is that if the time step (formula_29) changes, the method does not approximate the solution to the differential equation. This can be corrected using the formula
:formula_72

A more exact derivation uses the Taylor series (to second order) at formula_73 for times formula_74 and formula_75 to obtain after elimination of formula_76
:formula_77
so that the iteration formula becomes
:formula_78

===Computing velocities – Størmer–Verlet method===
The velocities are not explicitly given in the basic Størmer equation, but often they are necessary for the calculation of certain physical quantities like the kinetic energy. This can create technical challenges in molecular dynamics simulations, because kinetic energy and instantaneous temperatures at time formula_11 cannot be calculated for a system until the positions are known at time formula_80. This deficiency can either be dealt with using the velocity Verlet algorithm or by estimating the velocity using the position terms and the mean value theorem:
:formula_81

Note that this velocity term is a step behind the position term, since this is for the velocity at time formula_11, not formula_80, meaning that formula_84 is a second-order approximation to formula_85. With the same argument, but halving the time step, formula_86 is a second-order approximation to formula_87, with formula_88.

One can shorten the interval to approximate the velocity at time formula_80 at the cost of accuracy:
:formula_90

== Velocity Verlet ==
A related, and more commonly used algorithm is the velocity Verlet algorithm, similar to the leapfrog method, except that the velocity and position are calculated at the same value of the time variable (leapfrog does not, as the name suggests). This uses a similar approach, but explicitly incorporates velocity, solving the problem of the first time step in the basic Verlet algorithm:

:formula_91

It can be shown that the error in the velocity Verlet is of the same order as in the basic Verlet. Note that the velocity algorithm is not necessarily more memory-consuming, because, in basic Verlet, we keep track of two vectors of position, while in velocity Verlet, we keep track of one vector of position and one vector of velocity. The standard implementation scheme of this algorithm is:
# Calculate formula_92.
# Calculate formula_93.
# Derive formula_94 from the interaction potential using formula_95.
# Calculate formula_96.
This algorithm also works with variable time steps, and is identical to the &#x27;kick-drift-kick&#x27; form of leapfrog method integration.

Eliminating the half-step velocity, this algorithm may be shortened to
# Calculate formula_97.
# Derive formula_94 from the interaction potential using formula_95.
# Calculate formula_100.

Note, however, that this algorithm assumes that acceleration formula_94 only depends on position formula_95 and does not depend on velocity formula_103.

One might note that the long-term results of velocity Verlet, and similarly of leapfrog are one order better than the semi-implicit Euler method. The algorithms are almost identical up to a shift by half a time step in the velocity. This can be proven by rotating the above loop to start at step 3 and then noticing that the acceleration term in step 1 could be eliminated by combining steps 2 and 4. The only difference is that the midpoint velocity in velocity Verlet is considered the final velocity in semi-implicit Euler method.

The global error of all Euler methods is of order one, whereas the global error of this method is, similar to the midpoint method, of order two. Additionally, if the acceleration indeed results from the forces in a conservative mechanical or Hamiltonian system, the energy of the approximation essentially oscillates around the constant energy of the exactly solved system, with a global error bound again of order one for semi-explicit Euler and order two for Verlet-leapfrog. The same goes for all other conserved quantities of the system like linear or angular momentum, that are always preserved or nearly preserved in a symplectic integrator.

The velocity Verlet method is a special case of the Newmark-beta method with formula_104 and formula_105.

=== Algorithmic representation ===
Since velocity Verlet is a generally useful algorithm in 3D applications, a solution written in C++ could look like below. This type of position integration will significantly increase accuracy in 3D simulations and games when compared with the regular Euler method.
struct Body
 Vec3d pos { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
 Vec3d vel { 2.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // 2 m/s along x-axis
 Vec3d acc { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // no acceleration at first
 double mass = 1.0; // 1kg
 * Updates pos and vel using &quot;Velocity Verlet&quot; integration
 * @param dt DeltaTime / time step [eg: 0.01]
 void update(double dt)
 Vec3d new_pos = pos + vel*dt + acc*(dt*dt*0.5);
 Vec3d new_acc = apply_forces();
 Vec3d new_vel = vel + (acc+new_acc)*(dt*0.5);
 pos = new_pos;
 vel = new_vel;
 acc = new_acc;

 * To apply velocity to your objects, calculate the required Force vector instead
 * and apply the accumulated forces here.
 Vec3d apply_forces() const
 Vec3d new_acc = Vec3d{0.0, 0.0, -9.81 }; // 9.81 m/s² down in the z-axis
 // Apply any other forces here...
 // NOTE: Avoid depending on `vel` because Velocity Verlet assumes acceleration depends on position.
 return new_acc;
};
==Error terms==
The global truncation error of the Verlet method is formula_106, both for position and velocity.
This is in contrast with the fact that the local error in position is only formula_107 as described above. The difference is due to the accumulation of the local truncation error over all of the iterations.

The global error can be derived by noting the following:

:formula_108

and

:formula_109

Therefore

:formula_110

Similarly:

:formula_111

which can be generalized to (it can be shown by induction, but it is given here without proof):

:formula_112

If we consider the global error in position between formula_113 and formula_114, where formula_115, it is clear that

:formula_116

and therefore, the global (cumulative) error over a constant interval of time is given by

:formula_117

Because the velocity is determined in a non-cumulative way from the positions in the Verlet integrator, the global error in velocity is also formula_106.

In molecular dynamics simulations, the global error is typically far more important than the local error, and the Verlet integrator is therefore known as a second-order integrator.

==Constraints==

Systems of multiple particles with constraints are simpler to solve with Verlet integration than with Euler methods. Constraints between points may be, for example, potentials constraining them to a specific distance or attractive forces. They may be modeled as springs connecting the particles. Using springs of infinite stiffness, the model may then be solved with a Verlet algorithm.

In one dimension, the relationship between the unconstrained positions formula_119 and the actual positions formula_120 of points formula_121 at time formula_11, given a desired constraint distance of formula_123, can be found with the algorithm

:formula_124

Verlet integration is useful because it directly relates the force to the position, rather than solving the problem using velocities.

Problems, however, arise when multiple constraining forces act on each particle. One way to solve this is to loop through every point in a simulation, so that at every point the constraint relaxation of the last is already used to speed up the spread of the information. In a simulation this may be implemented by using small time steps for the simulation, using a fixed number of constraint-solving steps per time step, or solving constraints until they are met by a specific deviation.

When approximating the constraints locally to first order, this is the same as the Gauss–Seidel method. For small matrices it is known that LU decomposition is faster. Large systems can be divided into clusters (for example, each ragdoll = cluster). Inside clusters the LU method is used, between clusters the Gauss–Seidel method is used. The matrix code can be reused: The dependency of the forces on the positions can be approximated locally to first order, and the Verlet integration can be made more implicit.

Sophisticated software, such as SuperLU exists to solve complex problems using sparse matrices. Specific techniques, such as using (clusters of) matrices, may be used to address the specific problem, such as that of force propagating through a sheet of cloth without forming a sound wave.

Another way to solve holonomic constraints is to use constraint algorithms.

==Collision reactions==
One way of reacting to collisions is to use a penalty-based system, which basically applies a set force to a point upon contact. The problem with this is that it is very difficult to choose the force imparted. Use too strong a force, and objects will become unstable, too weak, and the objects will penetrate each other. Another way is to use projection collision reactions, which takes the offending point and attempts to move it the shortest distance possible to move it out of the other object.

The Verlet integration would automatically handle the velocity imparted by the collision in the latter case; however, note that this is not guaranteed to do so in a way that is consistent with collision physics (that is, changes in momentum are not guaranteed to be realistic). Instead of implicitly changing the velocity term, one would need to explicitly control the final velocities of the objects colliding (by changing the recorded position from the previous time step).

The two simplest methods for deciding on a new velocity are perfectly elastic and inelastic collisions. A slightly more complicated strategy that offers more control would involve using the coefficient of restitution.

<doc id="825737" wikidata="Q1164173" url="?curid=825737" title="The Arrogant Worms">
<text>The Arrogant Worms are a Canadian musical comedy trio founded in 1991 that parodies many musical genres. They are well known for their humorous on-stage banter in addition to their music. The members since 1995 are Trevor Strong (vocals), Mike McCormick (guitar, vocals), and Chris Patterson (bass, vocals).

==History==
The Arrogant Worms formed in 1991, with its founding members being Trevor Strong, Mike McCormick, John Whytock, and Steve Wood. They began by performing musical comedy on campus radio station CFRC at Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, and quickly moved to doing the same on CBC Radio, particularly on Jack Farr&#x27;s &quot;The Radio Show&quot;. Wood left the band in 1991. Whytock left in 1995, and was replaced by Chris Patterson.

The Worms have toured Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, playing to crowds as large as 100,000. They have played at celebrations on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and at a concert in New York, United States&#x27;s Central Park.

Since 1992 the Worms have released twenty-one albums, mostly independently, with sales exceeding 175,000. Their songs pay homage, always humorously, to different genres and topics. In 2003, they released a CD and DVD that was recorded live with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. Some of their albums include contributions from prominent musicians, including Andy Thompson, Andrew Affleck, Gord Thompson, Adrian Dolan, Mike Ford, John Loughrey, Terry Tufts and Tim Readman, who is also their dialect coach.

Rock, folk, ballads, country, and children&#x27;s music all have been genres parodied by the Worms. When not spoofing a particular style of music, the Worms&#x27; material pokes fun at various aspects of daily life in Canada with songs like &quot;Canada&#x27;s Really Big&quot;, &quot;Me Like Hockey&quot;, &quot;We Are the Beaver&quot;, &quot;I Am Not American&quot;, and &quot;Proud to Be Canadian&quot;.

They have also recorded music videos for three songs: &quot;Big Fat Road Manager&quot;, &quot;Carrot Juice Is Murder&quot;, and &quot;The River (River of Snot)&quot;. The first two of these are included on the &quot;Three Worms and an Orchestra&quot; DVD, which includes appearances by Tom Cavanagh, Nathan Fillion and Kurt Browning.

The band has long supported the cause of literacy in Canada, and have twice won the Peter Gzowski Award for their efforts.

<doc id="825745" wikidata="Q1073700" url="?curid=825745" title="Big Five banks of Canada">
<text>Big Five is the name colloquially given to the five largest banks that dominate the banking industry of Canada: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Scotiabank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD).

All of the five Canadian banks maintain their respective headquarters in Toronto&#x27;s Financial District, primarily along Bay Street. All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks&#x27; shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.

According to a ranking produced by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, in 2017, the Big Five banks of Canada are among the world&#x27;s 100 largest banks, with TD Bank, RBC, Scotiabank, BMO, and CIBC at 26th, 28th, 45th, 52nd, and 63rd place, respectively. RBC and TD Bank are also on the Financial Stability Board&#x27;s list of systemically important banks as of 2020.

The term “Big Six” is sometimes used to include Canada&#x27;s next largest bank, National Bank of Canada.

==Overview==
The Big Five banks, listed in order of market capitalization on the Toronto Stock Exchange as of year-ended 2023, with their current corporate brand names and corporate profiles according to their latest annual report, all monetary amounts are in billions of Canadian dollars, are:

In modern history, Royal Bank (RBC) has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has caught up to RBC in recent years. Up to the late 1990s, CIBC was the second largest, followed by Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, and TD Bank. During the late 1990s and beyond, this ranking changed due to several reorganizations. Royal Bank acquired Royal Trust in 1993, while Scotiabank purchased National Trust in 1997. As Scotiabank found no merger partners among the other banks in the big five group, it instead expanded its international operations and passed the Bank of Montreal in size. TD Bank merged with Canada Trust, which was for a long time the largest trust in Canada, thus vaulting TD into the number two spot. While there were no major changes to Bank of Montreal, CIBC&#x27;s first unsuccessful foray into the US market led it to shed its assets there, dropping it to the number five spot.

Four of the Big Five Canadian banks have acquired independent investment banks, whose activities included corporate banking and full service brokerage. From 2000 onwards, these investment banking subsidiaries, RBC Dominion Securities, BMO Nesbitt Burns, CIBC Wood Gundy, and McLeod Young Weir, were all rebranded to RBC Capital Markets, BMO Capital Markets, CIBC World Markets, and Scotia Capital, respectively. Nonetheless, their bank holding company parent still use the old names as a brand for their full service brokerage under wealth management, plus the old name still remains the broker dealer subsidiary for their investment bank in Canada.

Desjardins Group and ATB Financial are major regional financial institutions. Desjardins, a federation of 313 autonomous credit unions (), is one of the largest financial institutions in Quebec and also operates in some regions of Ontario with substantial Franco-Ontarian populations. ATB Financial (formerly Alberta Treasury Branches) is a Crown corporation owned by the Alberta provincial government that was originally established in 1938 after the province&#x27;s attempt to impose social credit policies on federally-regulated banks failed.

==Proposed mergers==
In 1998, the Bank of Montreal proposed a merger with the Royal Bank of Canada around the same time that CIBC proposed to combine with the Toronto-Dominion Bank. The banks argued that these mergers would enable them to compete globally with other financial institutions. This would have left Canada with only three major national banks. The mergers were reviewed by the Competition Bureau of Canada, which declared that negative effects (such as higher user fees and local branch closures) from the mergers would far outweigh the benefits of allowing the mergers. Ultimately, it was then Finance Minister Paul Martin who rejected both proposed mergers. The issue since has not been revisited by succeeding Finance Ministers; it has been cited as a reason that the Canadian economy easily weathered the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis compared to other nations, and the aforementioned recognition of numerous Canadian banks on the Bloomberg 2011 list of twenty strongest large banks in the world.

===Potential foreign forays===
The weakness of the Canadian dollar and high U.S. bank stock prices were commonly cited as obstacles to purchasing assets south of the border. However the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis reversed this trend. In the aftermath of the crisis, the Canadian dollar steadily climbed against the U.S. dollar, achieving parity in early 2008 and trading as high as 30 cents above the USD in late 2008. The strength of the Canadian dollar and the relative weakness of U.S. bank prices have led commentators to suggest that the big five banks could consider an expansion into the United States.

Because of the recent recession, Royal Bank of Canada has now eclipsed Morgan Stanley in terms of market valuation. According to figures compiled by a recent Bloomberg report, investors today are willing to pay about $2.60 for every dollar of book value at a Canadian bank, compared with $1.70 in the United States. That ratio is about the reverse of where it stood in late 1999.

The last time the U.S. financial markets were weak, many Canadian bank CEOs were criticized for not making a more concerted buying effort. Some believed that these CEOs preferred to wait for Ottawa to allow domestic mergers before expanding into the US. The federal government ended up refusing to allow the mergers and is unlikely to do so now. Analysts also pointed out that Canadian banks have much stronger balance sheets today than they did 10 or 15 years ago, putting them in an even better position to be aggressive.

In October 2007, TD purchased Commerce Bancorp, a medium-sized US bank with a strong branch network in the Mid-Atlantic states and Florida. As of March 2008, their stated plan was to merge Commerce with their existing TD Banknorth subsidiary, calling the new bank TD Commerce Bank. However, &quot;Commerce Bank&quot; based in Worcester, Massachusetts challenged the new name. As a result, TD renamed its US subsidiary TD Bank at end of 2009. TD is the sixth-largest bank by branch network in North America, after JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC, and US Bank. It is also the largest foreign bank in the United States holding almost $200 billion (USD) in deposits.

===Banking regulation ===
Canada&#x27;s federal government has sole jurisdiction for banks according to the Canadian Constitution, specifically Section 91(15) of &quot;The Constitution Act 1867&quot; (30 &amp; 31 Victoria, c.3 (UK)), formerly known as the &quot;British North America Act 1867&quot;. Meanwhile, credit unions/caisses populaires, securities dealers and mutual funds are largely regulated by provincial governments.

The main federal statute for the incorporation and regulation of banks, or &quot;chartered banks&quot;, is the &quot;Bank Act&quot; (S.C. 1991, c.46), where Schedules I, II and III of this Act list all banks permitted to operate in Canada under these three distinct categories.

<doc id="825748" wikidata="Q151324" url="?curid=825748" title="Propylene">
<text>Propylene, also known as propene, is an unsaturated organic compound with the chemical formula . It has one double bond, and is the second simplest member of the alkene class of hydrocarbons. It is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor.

Propylene is a product of combustion from forest fires, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle and aircraft exhaust. It was discovered in 1850 by A. W. von Hoffmann&#x27;s student Captain (later Major General) John Williams Reynolds as the only gaseous product of thermal decomposition of amyl alcohol to react with chlorine and bromine.

==Production==
===Steam cracking===

The dominant technology for producing propylene is steam cracking, using propane as the feedstock. Cracking propane yields a mixture of ethylene, propylene, methane, hydrogen gas, and other related compounds. The yield of propylene is about 15%. The other principal feedstock is naphtha, especially in the Middle East and Asia. 
Propylene can be separated by fractional distillation from the hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from cracking and other refining processes; refinery-grade propene is about 50 to 70%. In the United States, shale gas is a major source of propane.

===Olefin conversion technology===
In the Phillips triolefin or olefin conversion technology, propylene is interconverted with ethylene and 2-butenes. Rhenium and molybdenum catalysts are used: 
:&lt;chem&gt;CH2=CH2{} + CH3CH=CHCH3 -&gt;[][\text{Re, Mo} \atop \text{catalyst}] 2 CH2=CHCH3&lt;/chem&gt;

The technology is founded on an olefin metathesis reaction discovered at Phillips Petroleum Company. Propylene yields of about 90 wt% are achieved.
Related is the Methanol-to-Olefins/Methanol-to-Propene process. It converts synthesis gas (syngas) to methanol, and then converts the methanol to ethylene and/or propene. The process produces water as a by-product. Synthesis gas is produced from the reformation of natural gas or by the steam-induced reformation of petroleum products such as naphtha, or by gasification of coal or natural gas.

===Fluid catalytic cracking===
High severity fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) uses traditional FCC technology under severe conditions (higher catalyst-to-oil ratios, higher steam injection rates, higher temperatures, etc.) in order to maximize the amount of propene and other light products. A high severity FCC unit is usually fed with gas oils (paraffins) and residues, and produces about 20–25% (by mass) of propene on feedstock together with greater volumes of motor gasoline and distillate byproducts. These high temperature processes are expensive and have a high carbon footprint. For these reasons, alternative routes to propylene continue to attract attention.

=== Other commercialized methods ===
On-purpose propylene production technologies were developed throughout the twentieth century. Of these, propane dehydrogenation technologies such as the CATOFIN and OLEFLEX processes have become common, although they still make up a minority of the market, with most of the olefin being sourced from the above mentioned cracking technologies. Platinum, chromia, and vanadium catalysts are common in propane dehydrogenation processes.

===Market===
Propene production has remained static at around 35 million tonnes (Europe and North America only) from 2000 to 2008, but it has been increasing in East Asia, most notably Singapore and China. Total world production of propene is currently about half that of ethylene.

===Research===
The use of engineered enzymes has been explored but has not been commercialized.

There is ongoing research into the use of oxygen carrier catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This poses several advantages, as this reaction mechanism can occur at lower temperatures than conventional dehydrogenation, and may not be equilibrium-limited because oxygen is used to combust the hydrogen by-product.

==Uses==
Propylene is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene. It is the raw material for a wide variety of products. Polypropylene manufacturers consume nearly two thirds of global production. Polypropylene end uses include films, fibers, containers, packaging, and caps and closures. Propene is also used for the production of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, butyraldehyde, and acrylic acid. In the year 2013 about 85 million tonnes of propylene were processed worldwide.

Propylene and benzene are converted to acetone and phenol via the cumene process. 
Propylene is also used to produce isopropyl alcohol (propan-2-ol), acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and epichlorohydrin.
The industrial production of acrylic acid involves the catalytic partial oxidation of propylene. Propylene is an intermediate in the oxidation to acrylic acid.

In industry and workshops, propylene is used as an alternative fuel to acetylene in Oxy-fuel welding and cutting, brazing and heating of metal for the purpose of bending. It has become a standard in BernzOmatic products and others in MAPP substitutes, now that true MAPP gas is no longer available.

==Reactions==
Propylene resembles other alkenes in that it undergoes electrophilic addition reactions relatively easily at room temperature. The relative weakness of its double bond explains its tendency to react with substances that can achieve this transformation. Alkene reactions include:
* Polymerization and oligomerization
* Oxidation
* Halogenation
* Hydrohalogenation
* Alkylation
* Hydration
* Hydroformylation

===Complexes of transition metals===
Foundational to hydroformylation, alkene metathesis, and polymerization are metal-propylene complexes, which are intermediates in these processes. Propylene is prochiral, meaning that binding of a reagent (such as a metal electrophile) to the C=C group yields one of two enantiomers.

=== Polymerization ===

The majority of propylene is used to form polypropylene, a very important commodity thermoplastic, through chain-growth polymerization. In the presence of a suitable catalyst (typically a Ziegler–Natta catalyst), propylene will polymerize. There are multiple ways to achieve this, such as using high pressures to suspending the catalyst in a solution of liquid propylene, or running gaseous propylene through a fluidized bed reactor.

===Oligomerizationn===
In the presence of catalysts, propylene will form various short oligomers. It can dimerizes to give 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene and/or 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. or trimerise to form tripropylene.

==Environmental safety==
Propene is a product of combustion from forest fires, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle and aircraft exhaust. It is an impurity in some heating gases. Observed concentrations have been in the range of 0.1–4.8 parts per billion (ppb) in rural air, 4–10.5 ppb in urban air, and 7–260 ppb in industrial air samples.

In the United States and some European countries a threshold limit value of 500 parts per million (ppm) was established for occupational (8-hour time-weighted average) exposure. It is considered a volatile organic compound (VOC) and emissions are regulated by many governments, but it is not listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. With a relatively short half-life, it is not expected to bioaccumulate.

Propene has low acute toxicity from inhalation and is not considered to be carcinogenic. Chronic toxicity studies in mice did not yield significant evidence suggesting adverse effects. Humans briefly exposed to 4,000 ppm did not experience any noticeable effects. Propene is dangerous from its potential to displace oxygen as an asphyxiant gas, and from its high flammability/explosion risk.

Bio-propylene is the bio-based propylene.
It has been examined, motivated by diverse interests such a carbon footprint. Production from glucose has been considered. More advanced ways of addressing such issues focus on electrification alternatives to steam cracking.

==Storage and handling==
Propene is flammable. Propene is usually stored as liquid under pressure, although it is also possible to store it safely as gas at ambient temperature in approved containers.

==Occurrence in nature==
Propene is detected in the interstellar medium through microwave spectroscopy. On September 30, 2013, NASA announced the detection of small amounts of naturally occurring propene in the atmosphere of Titan using infrared spectroscopy. The detection was made by a team led by NASA GSFC scientist Conor Nixon using data from the CIRS instrument on the Cassini orbiter spacecraft, part of the Cassini-Huygens mission. Its confirmation solved a 32-year old mystery by filling a predicted gap in Titan&#x27;s detected hydrocarbons, adding the C3H6 species (propene) to the already-detected C3H4 (propyne) and C3H8 (propane).

<text>: &quot;For the USAF unmanned Quail drone aircraft, see ADM-20 Quail.&quot;
The IMCO CallAir A-9 is an agricultural aircraft that first flew in 1962, a development of the company&#x27;s previous successful crop-dusters. It is typical of aircraft of its type - a single-seat aircraft with a low wing incorporating spraying gear.

==Design and development==
The Call Aircraft Company (CAC) had built the CallAir Model A series of light utility and agricultural aircraft. Following the purchase of CAC in 1962 by Intermountain Manufacturing Company (IMCO) the latter produced a new agricultural derivative of the Callair, the CallAir A-9. Production of the new aircraft started in 1963.

Like the earlier CallAir aircraft, the A-9 is a single-engined monoplane with a braced low wing. It is of mixed construction, with a fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage structure and a wood-and-fabric wing. The pilot sits behind the chemical hopper, and the cockpit is enclosed by two removable, bottom-hinged doors that form the left and right side windows. The aircraft is powered by a single Lycoming O-540 flat-six piston engine. Later, some A-9s have been adapted for glider towing operations.

IMCO was in turn purchased by Rockwell International in 1966, which built the plane under its Aero Commander division before shifting production to Mexico in 1971, under a joint venture there called AAMSA. Production ceased in 1984.

==Variants==
;A-9
:Original variant, powered by a 235 hp (175 kW) Lycoming O-540-B2B5. Built by CallAir, IMCO and Aero Commander (as the Sparrow Commander)
;A-9B (Super)

<text>The College English Test (), better known as CET, is a national English as a foreign language test in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It examines the English proficiency of undergraduate and postgraduate students in China. It is meant to ensure that Chinese undergraduates and postgraduates reach the required English levels specified in the National College English Teaching Syllabuses (NCETS). This test has existed in China for 26 years and now 18 million people take it annually. It includes two levels, CET4 (四级) and CET6 (六级), and prefers American English.

Another kind of national English as a foreign language test is Test for English Majors (), better known as TEM. It includes two levels—TEM4 (四级) and TEM8 (八级).

==College English Test==
Generally, all non-English-major university students are allowed to take the College English Test.

===Before 2005 reform===
Before the 2005 reform, the maximum score was 100 points. A test score higher than 85 is graded as &quot;Excellent&quot;, and a test score higher than 60 but below 85 is graded as &quot;Pass&quot; in the certificate. This test was held nationally twice a year in summer and winter. The CET consisted of the non-English-specialized &quot;Band 4&quot; (CET4), in which certificate-holders have reached the English level of non-English major undergraduate students, and &quot;Band 6&quot; (CET6), in which the certificate-holders have reached the English level of non-English major postgraduates. The test included listening, reading and writing sections. The spoken test was optional.

===2005 reform===

The CET was reformed in 2005. Several changes were made, including:

*Re-ordered and re-organized sections; more listening and spoken sections; new &quot;Skimming &amp; Scanning&quot; and &quot;Translation&quot; sections;
*New grading system: scores are graded on a curved scale, so that the highest score possible is 710, while the lowest mark is a score of 290 (finish all questions but all wrong);
*Passing grades and qualification certificate elimination; 
*A more detailed score report on each section;
*Public service elimination: only university students need to take the test.

The CET-4 is important for university students in China who are not English majors. It is not a prerequisite for a bachelor&#x27;s degree but some universities in China require students get 425 scores in CET4 to get the degree. Many postgraduate universities also require CET4 at least 425 or CET6 at least 425. In some universities, if students want to get the qualification to be enrolled as a master student without an exam(Bishi),that is to say, he or she can Baoyan, they should get CET6 certification. Many employers in China prefer applicants with CET-4 or even CET-6 certification.

Passing the CET is important for Chinese college students. Graduates may only be able to get a degree or a good job if they can pass the CET with a high score.

While the CET tests reading, writing and listening, it does have a separate test for speaking. The speaking test is held twice a year and only students with a CET Band-4 score higher than 550 or a CET Band-6 higher than 485 are eligible for the test.

==Test for English Majors==

A similar but more rigorous test, the Test for English Majors (TEM), is mandatory for English majors, and it is generally only for English majors. For these students, passing the TEM-4 is a graduation requirement. The test should be taken by the end of the second academic or sophomore year. TEM-8 (&quot;Band 8&quot;) is the highest level for English major students; it should be taken during the end of the last academic or senior year.

If an English-major student fails to pass the TEM-4 during their sophomore year, they may attempt to pass the TEM-8 during their senior year. Those failing the TEM-8 are only allowed one re-test (during the following year after they have graduated from college). A second failure results in lifelong disqualification.

Both TEM4 and TEM8 are the only two lifelong qualifications for any student.

==Vocabulary requirements==
=== CET series ===
*CET-4: 4500 words
*CET-6: 6500 words

=== TEM series ===
*TEM-4: 8000 words
*TEM-8: 13000 words

==Social consequences==
Some Chinese researchers point out the positive social consequences of the CET as it has promoted the role of English teaching and learning at the tertiary level in China over its 20-year history. At the same time, other researchers challenge the CET by pointing out that the test does not assess communicative competence as the teaching syllabus requires. Before the recent reform of the CET, the large proportion of multiple choice questions made this test an efficient one, but possible sacrifices in accurately measuring English language ability remained a concern. Since the CET certificates had been one of the graduation requirements of undergraduates in the majority of Chinese universities for almost 20 years, test-oriented teaching was another severe problem. However, changes made in the CET test content, format, and scoring systems are evidence of the endeavors to bring about positive washback of the test on English teaching and learning in China. It is the expectation of the CET committee that the test can reflect and catch up with the needs of rapid economic reform and the new open-door policy.

==Exam score distributions==
Answering all questions incorrectly will result in 330, the lowest score a test taker can get in CET4. By contrast, receiving a score higher than 600 is usually regarded as &quot;perfect&quot; and that means the test taker has not only answered most multiple choice questions correctly but also received positive feedback on their performance in the writing section.

<doc id="825761" wikidata="Q7301775" url="?curid=825761" title="Rebecca Howe">
<text>Rebecca Howe is a fictional character of the American television sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, portrayed by Kirstie Alley and created by Glen and Les Charles. Rebecca appeared in 147 episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot; between 1987 and 1993 and in one episode of &quot;Wings&quot;. She debuts in the season six episode &quot;Home Is the Sailor&quot; after Shelley Long—who played waitress Diane Chambers—left the show to pursue a movie career. Much of the show&#x27;s humor in previous seasons had been based around the interaction and sexual tension between the womanizing, working-class main character, bartender Sam Malone, and the high-class, snobbish Diane. Rebecca was intended to fill the gap as Sam&#x27;s new female foil.

After Sam sells the bar to a corporation, the audience learns Rebecca is the new manager of Cheers. She spars with Sam and frequently rejects his advances. She gradually becomes neurotic and falls in love with almost every rich man in Boston. With the exception of the late Nicholas Colasanto, Alley was the only &quot;Cheers&quot; regular cast member who never reprised her role in the spin-off series &quot;Frasier&quot;, even when her character Rebecca is briefly mentioned in the episode, &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot;.

For her performance as Rebecca, Alley won a Golden Globe Award in 1991 as the Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical Series and an Emmy Award in 1991 as an Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

==Role==
Rebecca Howe is first seen at &quot;Cheers&quot; as the manager assigned by the bar&#x27;s new corporate franchise owner, the Lillian Corporation. Elements of her back story are revealed over several years. She was born in San Diego, one of four children. Rebecca&#x27;s father (Robert Prosky) is an ex-Navy man and her mother was a concert cellist. Rebecca&#x27;s sister Susan (Marcia Cross) is an actress and former Miss San Diego who has stolen her past boyfriends. Revealed in &quot;The Last Angry Mailman&quot; (1987), Rebecca was nicknamed &quot;Backseat Becky&quot; for her behavior as a party girl while at the University of Connecticut. In her early appearances, Rebecca appears as a confident, cool and collected businesswoman. Her behavior slowly becomes neurotic as the series progresses and her competent and driven façade crumbles away entirely by the series&#x27; end.

===Storylines===
When she first meets bartender and ladies&#x27; man Sam Malone (Ted Danson), Rebecca&#x27;s reaction to him is negative. Sam often tries to seduce her; in her first couple (or few) years at Cheers she always rejects his advances. In the sixth season (her debut season), Rebecca has a crush on her boss, Evan Drake (Tom Skerritt). Throughout the season she tries unsuccessfully to make Evan notice her until, toward the end of the season, Evan departs for Japan and is found to have a lover, so Rebecca is forced to let him go. In the seventh season, after Evan&#x27;s departure, his replacement fires Rebecca and promotes Sam to manager. Rebecca does occasional waitressing and eventually gets her job back. In the eighth season, she dates millionaire Robin Colcord (Roger Rees), but Sam discovers that he intends to secretly retrieve information from Rebecca&#x27;s computer to facilitate a corporate takeover, leading to their breakup. Rebecca finally falls for Sam after he saves her from Robin&#x27;s scheme, and after three years of suppressed attraction the two have sex in the Cheers office, leaving it wrecked. Rebecca later confessed to Sam it was one of the most powerful moments in her life. However, the affair is short-lived because Sam becomes complacent about it.

In the ninth season, Robin—now a wanted white-collar criminal—surrenders himself to the police and confesses his love for Rebecca. Meanwhile, Sam recovers his ownership of the bar just after the Lillian Corporation fires Rebecca. Sam rehires her as manager. Robin proposes matrimony to Rebecca after he is released from jail, and she accepts. In &quot;The Days of Wine and Neuroses&quot; (1991), Rebecca becomes drunk and confesses that she is questioning her feelings for Robin now that he has lost much of his fortune. In the following episode &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; (1991), Rebecca jilts Robin at their wedding and tells him, &quot;I only loved you for your money!&quot; Robin leaves her, retrieving a stash of $6 million hidden in the bar office under Rebecca&#x27;s desk. Later in the season, Rebecca decides to buy Cheers for herself after John Allen Hill becomes the new owner of the restaurant upstairs. John also owns the bar&#x27;s back room. Using money from her father, Rebecca helps Sam buy the back room of Cheers, and the two co-own the bar.

During the first half of the tenth season, Sam and Rebecca try to conceive a child, but they realize they have no feelings for each other and then decide to stay friends (the arc was originally to write in Alley&#x27;s pregnancy, but was scrapped when she unfortunately miscarried). Towards the end of the show, Rebecca does little work, often mentioned by Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman). In the eleventh and final season, Rebecca&#x27;s cigarette causes an enormous fire at Cheers, and she remorsefully uses her life savings to repair the bar. In &quot;Look Before You Sleep&quot; (1993), she is revealed to be the building superintendent of her apartment complex. In the penultimate episode &quot;The Guy Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1993), Rebecca initially rejects the advances of plumber Don Santry (Tom Berenger), but Frasier orders her to give Don another chance. For weeks Rebecca and Don date each other. Sam tries to convince her that she is making a big mistake with Don. In the series finale, she marries Don and resigns from Cheers to devote more time to her husband and to start a family. At first she regrets the marriage, but when Don later works for the Boston sewer department, she becomes happier with it.

Alley appeared as Rebecca briefly in a fourth-season episode of &quot;Wings&quot; titled &quot;I Love Brian&quot;. In the episode of the &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off series &quot;Frasier&quot; called &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot;, Sam visits Frasier and tells him that Don left Rebecca after he made a fortune on a plumbing-related invention, and Rebecca was &quot;back at the bar&quot;. When Frasier asks whether Sam means she is working at Cheers again, Sam replies, &quot;No, she&#x27;s just back at the bar.&quot; Alley opted not to appear on an episode of &quot;Frasier&quot; due to the sitcom being centered on two psychiatrists, which conflicted with her Scientology beliefs.

== Creation and casting ==
When Shelley Long decided to leave the show in 1987, ending the five-year Sam and Diane storyline, the creators wanted a new female lead and decided that she would not have blonde hair, would not resemble Long, and would be unknown to television viewers. Kirstie Alley, one of the first actresses to audition for the role of Rebecca Howe, was championed by casting director Jeff Greenberg and seemed to be the ideal choice. Other actresses who auditioned for Rebecca included Sharon Stone, Marg Helgenberger, and Kim Cattrall. Although Alley met all the criteria, the producers continued auditioning actresses for the part but none improved on Alley&#x27;s portrayal of the character. The main reservation on the part of the network and producers was whether Alley would be funny enough to play the role, since she had a dramatic acting background rather than one in comedy. Greenberg continued to advocate for her, and the Charles brothers were able to watch a clip from a comedy Alley had just completed, &quot;Summer School&quot;, and consult the director Carl Reiner, to judge Alley&#x27;s comic skills. Reiner praised Alley and assured Glen and Les Charles that she was the right choice.

According to &quot;Cheers&quot;″ co-creator and executive producer James Burrows, Diane Chambers, Rebecca Howe&#x27;s predecessor, was conceived as an executive businesswoman. Eventually, Diane evolved into a pretentious, college-educated waitress. After Long&#x27;s departure, the producers created Rebecca Howe as the businesswoman.

Despite concerns about losing Long, ratings rose after Alley&#x27;s debut. Rebecca began as a martinet and a &quot;smart, tough businesswoman&quot;. However, the writers were not thrilled with the character and did not find her funny. Writer Ken Levine said, &quot;In one episode though, she had to fall apart for some reason and was hysterical. We realized that the more neurotic, insecure, and sexually frustrated she was—the funnier she was. So the character evolved in that direction.&quot;

==Reception==

===Popularity===
According to a telephone survey of 1,011 people by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now Pew Research Center) conducted on April 1–4, 1993, Sam Malone was a favorite of 26% and Rebecca was a favorite by 6%. Twenty-one percent said Sam should marry Diane Chambers, 19% said he should marry Rebecca, 48% wanted him to stay single, and 12% had &quot;no opinion&quot; on this matter. When asked which character should be spun off, 15% voted for Sam, 12% voted for Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), 10% voted for Norm Peterson (George Wendt), and 29% voted no spin-offs. 2% of those questioned said Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer)whose own spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; debuted in September 1993should have his own show.

According to a 1993 article from &quot;People&quot; magazine, newspaper columnist Mike Royko chose Diane to marry Sam, novelist Jackie Collins picked Rebecca, actress Zsa Zsa Gabor chose both as Sam&#x27;s potential partners. Tennis player Martina Navratilova found Sam too good for either of them. Novelist and archaeologist Clive Cussler said Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) was &quot;Sam&#x27;s best bet.&quot;

=== Critical reaction ===
A syndicated television columnist from Chicago in 1989 said that in her second season on the show, Rebecca was &quot;nothing more than an annoying presence on a program otherwise populated with lovable wackos&quot;. Bill Carter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 1990 said Rebecca was &quot;hard-on-the-outside-mush-on-the-inside&quot;. J.D. Reed of &quot;People&quot; magazine in October 1990 called her a &quot;neurotic overachiever&quot;. Rick Marin of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; in November 1990 praised Kirstie Alley for bringing life into Rebecca Howe and making Rebecca a sympathetic &quot;loser&quot; who is full of ideals but lacks success, and her bringing more physical comedy than Shelley Long did. Steve Craig from the University of North Texas in 1993 considered Rebecca a parody of femininity for rejecting Sam&#x27;s advances and attempting to marry a tycoon. Columnist Faye Zuckerman in 1991 praised Rebecca&#x27;s &quot;broad range of talents&quot; as a character.

Bill Simmons, who wrote for ESPN in 2002, considered her one of his two least favorite characters, along with Lilith Sternin. In 2006, Lance Mannion in his &quot;Typepad&quot; blog said Rebecca wanted to be &quot;part of a world the gang at Cheers could never join. To be part of the gang, she would have to give up her too high opinion of herself, just as Diane had to.&quot; Mannion praised Kirstie Alley for physical comedy and her comical scenes with Ted Danson in the series. Josh Robertson of &quot;Complex&quot; website in 2013 included Rebecca and Sam at number 13 on his list of &quot;The 25 Most Sexual Sitcom Couples of All&quot;, said Rebecca &quot;may not have been as good for the comedy on &quot;Cheers&quot;, but she was way more attractive than Diane&quot;. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; critic Simone Torn in 2019 wrote that Rebecca&#x27;s transformation from &quot;a smart, goal-oriented businesswoman&quot; to &quot;a poorly-written woman who only cared about frivolous matters&quot; has been one of &quot;[ten] things from &quot;Cheers&quot; that have not aged well.&quot; Torn further wrote that Rebecca &quot;became a gold-digger and an active complainer who was more cartoonish in nature[.]&quot;

This role earned Kirstie Alley a Golden Globe Award in 1991 as the Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical Series. It also earned her an Emmy Award in 1991 as an Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

<doc id="825767" wikidata="Q414101" url="?curid=825767" title="Cyclopropene">
<text>Cyclopropene is an organic compound with the formula . It is the simplest cycloalkene. Because the ring is highly strained, cyclopropene is difficult to prepare and highly reactive. This colorless gas has been the subject for many fundamental studies of bonding and reactivity. It does not occur naturally, but derivatives are known in some fatty acids. Derivatives of cyclopropene are used commercially to control ripening of some fruit.

==Structure and bonding==
The molecule has a triangular structure. The reduced length of the double bond compared to a single bond causes the angle opposite the double bond to narrow to about 51° from the 60° angle found in cyclopropane. As with cyclopropane, the carbon–carbon bonding in the ring has increased p character: the alkene carbon atoms use sp2.68 hybridization for the ring.

==Synthesis of cyclopropene and derivatives==

===Early syntheses===
The first confirmed synthesis of cyclopropene, carried out by Dem&#x27;yanov and Doyarenko, involved the thermal decomposition of trimethylcyclopropylammonium hydroxide over platinized clay at approximately 300 °C. This reaction produces mainly trimethylamine and dimethylcyclopropyl amine, together with about 5% of cyclopropene. Later Schlatter improved the pyrolytic reaction conditions using platinized asbestos as a catalyst at 320–330 °C and obtained cyclopropene in 45% yield.

Cyclopropene can also be obtained in about 1% yield by thermolysis of the adduct of cycloheptatriene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate.

===Modern syntheses from allyl chlorides===
Allyl chloride undergoes dehydrohalogenation upon treatment with the base sodium amide at 80 °C to produce cyclopropene in about 10% yield.

The major byproduct of the reaction is allylamine. Adding allyl chloride to sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in boiling toluene over a period of 45–60 minutes produces the targeted compound in about 40% yield with an improvement in purity:
1-Methylcyclopropene is synthesized similarly but at room temperature from methallylchloride using phenyllithium as the base:
: + LiCl + 

===Syntheses of derivatives===
Treatment of nitrocyclopropanes with sodium methoxide eliminates the nitrite, giving the respective cyclopropene derivative. The synthesis of purely aliphatic cyclopropenes was first illustrated by the copper-catalyzed additions of carbenes to alkynes. In the presence of a copper catalyst, ethyl diazoacetate reacts with acetylenes to give cyclopropenes. 1,2-Dimethylcyclopropene-3-carboxylate arises via this method from 2-butyne. Copper, as copper sulfate and copper dust, are among the more popular forms of copper used to promote such reactions. Rhodium acetate has also been used. 

==Reactions of cyclopropene==
Studies on cyclopropene mainly focus on the consequences of its high ring strain. At 425 °C, cyclopropene isomerizes to methylacetylene (propyne).

Attempted fractional distillation of cyclopropene at –36 °C (its predicted boiling point) results in polymerization. The mechanism is assumed to be a free-radical chain reaction, and the product, based on NMR spectra, is thought to be polycyclopropane.

Cyclopropene undergoes the Diels–Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene to give endo-tricyclo[3.2.1.02,4]oct-6-ene. This reaction is commonly used to check for the presence of cyclopropene, following its synthesis.

<doc id="825775" wikidata="Q6489103" url="?curid=825775" title="Large Value Transfer System">
<text>The Large Value Transfer System, or LVTS, was the primary system in Canada for electronic wire transfers of large sums of money, and was operated by Payments Canada. It permitted the participating institutions and their clients to send large sums of money securely in real-time with complete certainty that the payment will settle. In September 2021, Payments Canada replaced LTVS with its Lynx high-value payment system.

Established in 1999, LVTS processed the majority of payments made every day in Canada, and was designed to work with funds in Canadian dollars (CAD). On a normal business day, it cleared and settled approximately CA$398 billion. Frequently, when settling the payments made through LVTS between each other, some banks found themselves with extra funds while others found themselves short; to come up with money, the banks were able borrow it from each other for a day, or &quot;overnight&quot;. The rate at which they borrowed being called overnight rate, targets for which were set by the Bank of Canada as part of its monetary policy.

LVTS was a real-time payment system: the recipient of the payment received it irrevocably in near real-time. As it settled on a deferred net basis at the end of each day, it was not a real-time gross settlement system.

<doc id="825781" wikidata="Q413343" url="?curid=825781" title="Cycloalkene">
<text>In organic chemistry, a cycloalkene or cycloolefin is a type of alkene hydrocarbon which contains a closed ring of carbon atoms and either one or more double bonds, but has no aromatic character. Some cycloalkenes, such as cyclobutene and cyclopentene, can be used as monomers to produce polymer chains. Due to geometrical considerations, smaller cycloalkenes are almost always the &quot;cis&quot; isomers, and the term &quot;cis&quot; tends to be omitted from the names. Cycloalkenes require considerable p-orbital overlap in the form of a bridge between the carbon-carbon double bond; however, this is not feasible in smaller molecules due to the increase of strain that could break the molecule apart. In greater carbon number cycloalkenes, the addition of substituents decreases strain. trans-Cycloalkenes with 7 or fewer carbons in the ring will not occur under normal conditions because of the large amount of ring strain needed. In larger rings (8 or more atoms), &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism of the double bond may occur. This stability pattern forms part of the origin of Bredt&#x27;s rule, the observation that alkenes do not form at the bridgehead of many types of bridged ring systems because the alkene would necessarily be &quot;trans&quot; in one of the rings.

==Examples==
== Nomenclature ==
Cycloalkenes follow a similar nomenclature system to alkenes, but the carbons are numbered starting at a carbon on the double bond and then through the double bond and around the ring. This method is used to keep the index numbers small. 

== Properties ==
Cycloalkenes with a small ring have about 20° more bond angle strain than a cycloalkane of the same size. This is because the bond angle for an alkene, C-C=C, is 122°, while the bond angle for an alkane, C-C-C, is 112°. When these carbons form a small ring, the alkene which has a larger bond angle will have to compress more than the alkane causing more bond angle strain.

Cycloalkenes have a lower melting point than cycloalkanes of the same size. The lowered melting point is due to the double bond preventing the compound from compact packing.

Cycloalkenes generally reflect physical properties of their cycloalkane. In physical states, only the smaller cycloalkenes are gases while the others are mostly liquid. These molecules are also more reactive than cycloalkanes due to increased electron density shifts of the double bond. 

== Trans isomers ==
As previously mentioned, cis-isomers of cycloalkenes exhibit more stability than trans-isomers; however, on an experimental and computational level, this property is only applicable to cycloalkenes with 10 carbons or less. As the number of carbons increase, the possibility of a trans-isomer occurring also increase. The geometrical considerations as analyzed by computational analysis are as follows.

The most stable trans-isomers of 10 ring or greater cycloalkenes exhibit 4  irregularities from standard geometric norms. The first irregularity is twisted planes of substituents along the C=C. Using C=C as the stable axis, 2 substituents of 1 carbon can be visualized on the same plane, equally applied to the other carbon. These planes are not planar and instead one carbon substituent plane twists along the axis away or toward the other carbon’s plane. This twisting leads to pyramidalization forming a pyramidal alkene which is the second irregularity. A greater angle of twisting, usually results in lower carbon number rings and decreases as the carbon number increases. Pyramidalization is important in highered number rings, because it increases p-orbital overlap for stability, and reduces torsional strain. 

Bond length between the C=C and corresponding vinylic carbons also vary. In smaller cycloalkenes, it is expected for the bonds to be greater in length uniformly to account for increased strain, but for example, trans-cycloheptane has varying bond lengths. Also, the vinylic carbons on trans cyclohexanes exhibit longer bond lengths than their respective cis isomer for trans-cycloheptane through trans-cyclononene (7 carbon and 9 carbon cycloalkenes).

== Synthesis reactions ==

=== Ring-closing metathesis ===
Ring-closing metathesis switches out functional groups from one or multiple terminal alkenes to form a cycloalkene. This process can be used to form cycloalkenes of either E or Z configurations, depending on the stereochemistry of the second ring strain.
=== Birch reduction ===
Birch reduction is a possible method to reduce reduces aromatic compounds into cycloalkenes, specifically cyclohexadiene.
=== Diels-Alder reaction ===
The Diels-Alder reaction, also known as cycloaddition, combines a conjugated diene and an alkene to form cycloalkene. This is a concerted process, with bonds forming and breaking simultaneously.
=== Cyclization reactions ===
Cyclization reactions, or intramolecular addition reactions, can be used to form cycloalkenes. These reactions primarily form cyclopentenones, a cycloalkene that contains two functional groups: the cyclopentene and a ketone group. However, other cycloalkenes, such as Cyclooctatetraene, can be formed as a result of this reaction.
=== Electrocyclic reactions ===
Reactions of conjugated double-bond systems can be synthesized into cycloalkenes through electrocyclic reactions. Addition of heat or photolysis causes a reversible reaction that causes one pi bond to become a sigma bond, which closes the ring and creates a cycloalkene.
=== Intramolecular McMurry reactions ===
When two carbonyl groups are coupled and undergo a McMurry reaction, there is a possibility of the formation of cycloalkenes under specific conditions. When both carbonyls are within the same molecule and not sufficiently separated from each other, a cycloalkene can be formed through an intramolecular McMurry reaction.
