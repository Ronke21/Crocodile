<text>Sir William Heygate Edmund Colborne Butlin (29 September 189912 June 1980) was an entrepreneur whose name is synonymous with the British holiday camp. Although holiday camps such as Warner&#x27;s existed in one form or another before Butlin opened his first in 1936, it was Butlin who turned holiday camps into a multimillion-pound industry and an important aspect of British culture.

Born in Cape Town, South Africa, to William and Bertha Butlin, Butlin had a turbulent childhood. His parents separated before he was seven, and he moved to England with his mother. He spent the next five years following his grandmother&#x27;s family fair around the country where his mother sold gingerbread, exposing the young Butlin to the skills of commerce and entertainment. When he was twelve his mother emigrated to Canada, leaving him in the care of his aunt for two years. Once settled in Toronto, his mother invited him to join her there.

In Canada, Butlin struggled to fit in at school and soon left for a job in a Toronto department store Eaton&#x27;s. In World War I he enlisted as a bugler in the Canadian Army. After the war, Butlin returned to England, bringing only £5 with him, he is seen on the 1921 cencus as lodging with John and Louisa Maggs in Avonmouth, Bristol and is described as Amusement Caterer travelling on own account. Investing £4 of that money to hire a stall travelling with his uncle&#x27;s fair, Butlin discovered that giving his customers a better chance to win brought more custom in, and he quickly became successful. One stall became several, including prominent locations such as Olympia in London, and Butlin soon purchased other fairground equipment and started his own travelling fair. He proved successful in this endeavour as well, and by 1927 he opened a static fairground in Skegness.

Over the next 10 years Butlin expanded his fairground empire, while harbouring an idea to increase the number of patrons in his Skegness site by providing accommodation. Butlin&#x27;s first holiday camp opened at Skegness in 1936, followed by Clacton, two years later. Plans to open a third in Filey were cut short by the outbreak of World War II. Butlin used the war to his advantage, persuading the MoD to complete the Filey Holiday Camp and construct two more camps in Ayr and Pwllheli as training camps which he reclaimed when the war was over. In the post-war boom, Butlin opened four more camps at Mosney, Bognor Regis, Minehead and Barry Island as well as buying hotels in Blackpool, Saltdean, and Cliftonville.

Butlin&#x27;s grave is in the grounds of Blair Adam house, Jersey.

==Early life==

William Heygate Edmund Colborne Butlin was born on 29 September 1899 in the Cape Colony (part of the modern-day Republic of South Africa). His father, William Colborne Butlin, was the son of a clergyman; his mother, Bertha Cassandra Hill, was a member of a family of travelling showmen. They met at a young age when Bertha&#x27;s parents were working a country fair that William attended. Their marriage was considered not socially acceptable in Leonard Stanley, Gloucestershire, where they lived, and they emigrated to South Africa. William founded a bicycle shop to support the family, and they had two children, Butlin and his brother Harry John (known as Binkie) Butlin. When the marriage failed, Butlin&#x27;s mother returned to England with her children and rejoined her own family in Coaley, near Bristol. Within a short time, Harry contracted polio and died. 

In his autobiography, Butlin recorded that his mother remarried and emigrated to Canada circa 1910. For two years, Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. (This may not be correct as the 1911 Census of England shows that he and his mother were residing with her sister in law in Organs Yard, Regents Road, Bedminster, Somerset, England.) In December 1913, his mother returned to England and married Charles Robotham in Swindon.

Butlin&#x27;s mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto. He accepted their offer, but was unhappy at school in Canada. He was mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at age 14. Eventually, he worked as a messenger at Eaton&#x27;s, Toronto&#x27;s largest department store. One aspect of working for the company was that he was able to visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday. Later, he transferred to Eaton&#x27;s advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, whilst studying at night school.

In 1915, during World War I, Butlin volunteered for service in the Canadian Army. Knowing that the army already had a full quota of despatch riders, Butlin intended to volunteer for service in that category in the knowledge that although his application would be declined he would still receive an &quot;I volunteered&quot; badge for his actions without having to serve. While applying, Butlin forgot to tell the recruiter of this intention, and was consequently allocated to the Canadian Expeditionary Force which was involved in the fighting along the Western Front. He was subsequently posted to the 170th (Mississauga Horse) Battalion on 29 December 1915. His attestation papers give his date of birth as 1898 (rather than the actual 1899), allowing him to enlist at age 15. The papers give his occupation as a &quot;Suit Case Maker&quot;. The papers also show, as Butlin himself later stated, that he had been selected to serve as a bugler. 

Before his deployment to Europe, Butlin transferred to the 216th (Bantams) Battalion, and he was sent to England. Once in England, he was stationed at Sandgate near Folkestone before being deployed to France. In France, the 216th became part of the 3rd Canadian Division which took part in the second battle of Vimy Ridge, as well the battles at Ypres and Arras, and the second battle of Cambrai; while in France, Butlin served as a stretcher bearer.

After the war, Butlin returned to England aboard a cattle ship, arriving in England with only £5 (2011:£) capital. He travelled to Bridgwater, Somerset where his uncle, Marshall Hill, was a showman. He purchased a hoopla stall from Hill, and ran it successfully. In later interviews, Butlin claimed that he accidentally sawed the corners off his hoopla blocks, but some observers such as &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot; report that he did it intentionally, displaying &quot;logic and business sense&quot;. In either case, Butlin&#x27;s actions allowed patrons to have a much higher success rate (approximately 3 in 5 for each ring) and brought him more custom than fellow stall holders. By contrast, an average game would have odds of approximately 1 in 9 for each ring or 1 in 3 for a 3-ring game. 

Butlin&#x27;s stall gave him less profit per customer than his competitors, but the increase in business gave him a bigger overall profit than theirs. He moved to London and set up a successful stall in Olympia outside the Christmas Circus run by Bertram Mills. By the end of the season, Butlin was so successful that he brought his widowed mother to the UK from Canada.

==Start of Butlin&#x27;s empire==
===Funfair and amusement parks===
Over the next few years Butlin toured the country with the Hills Travelling Fair, leaving his mother to run the Olympia site. Soon he had his own travelling fair visiting country fairs such as Barnstaple. Butlin opened some permanently-sited stalls in 1925, in Barry Island, Wales. In 1927 he leased land from the Earl of Scarbrough in the seaside town of Skegness. Here he established an amusement park with hoopla stalls, a tower slide, a haunted house, and a scenic railway. In 1928, Butlin secured an exclusive licence to sell dodgem cars in Europe. The first dodgems in Britain were available in his park at Skegness. Other showmen bought dodgems from Butlin. His activities in Skegness continued to expand, and by 1930 included a zoo featuring lions, zebras and an African village.

Butlin opened a similar fairground in 1932, in Bognor Regis, on the corner of the Esplanade, named the Recreation Shelter. In 1933 he opened a zoo nearby, which featured polar bears, kangaroos and monkeys. Around the same time he opened an amusement park in Bognor&#x27;s neighbouring village of Littlehampton, known as Butlin&#x27;s Park.

In the 1930s Butlin had amusement parks in Mablethorpe (opened 1928), Hayling Island (1931), Felixstowe (1931), Southsea (1931) and on the Isle of Man. He continued to operate his winter fair at Olympia and soon added the winter fairs at Waverley Hall in Edinburgh and at the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow. By 1935 most of his existing parks had zoos attached to them, providing another source of revenue.

Butlin&#x27;s funfair and amusement park business expanded in the post-war period. In 1938 he gained the sole contract to supply amusements to the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow and after the war, he continued to open amusement parks such as the one at Sheerness.
===First holiday camps===

Butlin had nurtured the idea of a holiday camp. He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts would, sometimes literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather. Butlin toyed with the idea of providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday-makers to stay on the site and provided entertainment for them between meals.
He opened his first Butlin&#x27;s camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. An advertisement costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week&#x27;s holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week&#x27;s full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned. Most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlin&#x27;s atmosphere was born. After that, entertainment was the heart of Butlins, and Bradford became the first of Butlin&#x27;s Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to be successful he would need many more on the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.

In his autobiography, Butlin refers to Clacton as his second camp; In 1937, architect Harold Ridley Hooper, who had drawn the plans for the camp at Skegness, created plans on behalf of Butlin&#x27;s Ltd., for a second camp at Dovercourt, in Essex. In the winter of 1938, the camp at Dovercourt was requisitioned by the government for housing children evacuated from Germany by the Kindertransport programme. Writers and speakers discussing that programme, such as Anthony Grenville and Ela Kaczmarska, claim that the camp had been constructed by Butlin and operated as a Butlin&#x27;s camp for the 1937–1938 season, Kaczmarska also suggests that it had closed in the summer of 1938, the same time the Clacton camp opened. Recollections of the refugees suggest that by December 1938 the camp was being run by Harry Warner, whose company Butlin was on the board of. At around the same time Butlin&#x27;s advertised Dovercourt as &quot;associated with Butlin&#x27;s&quot; and into the early 1940s Butlin was putting on rail packages with the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) to the Dovercourt camp.

Butlin proposed a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both the council and the local association of hotels opposed the idea, as did boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took the members of the council to Skegness to see how people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.

On 30 January 1937, Butlin turned his business into a limited company &quot;Butlin&#x27;s Ltd.&quot;. Butlin took the decision to form the company as a means to raise finance for his new camps. On 8 February 1937 the company published its prospectus ahead of a public sale of shares. When the shares became available, they sold out entirely in five minutes.

==World War II years==

With the outbreak of WWII, the Clacton and Skegness camps were requisitioned by the War Office for use as training camps. The ministry needed further camps, and contracted Butlin to build them. Butlin agreed, on the condition that he could purchase the sites after the war for use as holiday camps. The ministry agreed, and Filey, Pwllheli and Ayr were constructed, reopening as holday camps after the war (Filey in 1946, Pwllheli &amp; Ayr in 1947). As Butlin was dealing with other sites, he asked his business competitor, Harry Warner, to complete the construction of Filey. Butlin had purchased his first hotel in 1939, the Thatched Barn in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Like his camps, it was requisitioned (this time by the Special Operations Executive (SOE)) before he could develop it.

During the war years, a number of Butlin&#x27;s camps were used as Royal Navy shore establishments. Skegness became , a training establishment for petty officers. Pwllheli became HMS &quot;Glendower&quot;, and Ayr became HMS &quot;Scotia&quot;. Filey became RAF Hunmanby Moor and Clacton, after being considered for use as a prisoner of war camp, was later used as a training site for the Pioneer Corps. 

Butlin was recruited by the Ministry of Supply and asked to look at the causes of low morale amongst the workers in Britain&#x27;s munitions factories. His first stop was at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Chorley, where he found that the camouflaged huts and barbed wire fences used to house workers gave them the feeling of being interned. Using his experience in establishing holiday camps, Butlin devised activities and systems to boost morale, which led to his appointment as Director General of Hostels. 

In this position, Butlin introduced games and entertainment similar to those used in his holiday camps. These included: whist drives, amateur dramatics, theatrical productions and cinema. In 1943, he encouraged workers to continue taking their holiday entitlement but to do so at home, arranging various travelling fairs to visit towns on their &quot;holiday week&quot;. 

Butlin&#x27;s appointment to this role gave cause for concern in some quarters, with questions being asked of the under-secretary, Harold Macmillan, about the nature of his involvement. The appointment was a voluntary one with no salary or expenses and was made after the consideration of other suitable candidates.

Late in the war, during the Allied advance through western Europe following the Normandy landings, Butlin was approached by General Bernard Montgomery, who asked him to help set up leave centres for the 21st Army Group. Starting in Brussels, the &quot;21 Club&quot; concept quickly spread through western Europe, providing entertainment and relaxation for servicemen and women.

In 1944, Butlin was awarded the MBE for his wartime service to the Ministry of Supply.

==Post war expansion==
After the war, it became apparent that most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation, and the situation was so bad that questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.

In most ways Mosney was identical to the existing successful camps, but in Ireland this was something that was seen to be feared, rather than embraced. A number of complaints appeared in the &quot;Catholic Standard&quot;, warning that holiday camps were an English idea that were undesirable in Catholic Ireland. Like the other camps, Mosney was designed to have a church and reassurances were given that it would be a Catholic chapel with a resident priest. Reassurances were also given that Irish nationals would have priority over British tourists in booking holidays. In July 1948 the camp was opened by William Norton, the Minister for Social Welfare, and it operated successfully as a Butlin&#x27;s camp until the early 1980s.

A more ambitious plan by Butlin was conceived on a trip to The Bahamas in 1946. Seeing potential for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess Hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.
Butlin did not celebrate for long; he required a further $2.25 million (2011:£) to complete the camp, and American tourists unaccustomed to the holiday camp concept had little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.

==Further camps==
In the 1960s Butlin created a series of new camps at Bognor Regis (opened 1960), Minehead (1962) and Barry Island (1966). Barry Island remained part of the Butlin&#x27;s empire until the 1980s, while Bognor and Minehead remain part of the company today.

On 2 July 1960 Butlin planned to open his holiday camp at Bognor, but because of flooding it was not ready. Butlin offered his patrons the chance to be re-sited at Clacton or to stay and help complete the camp&#x27;s construction. A number opted to stay and help, and received a free bottle of champagne as a reward. Once opened, the camp quickly became popular, accommodating around 5,000 campers and another 5,000 day visitors.

In the winter of 1961, Butlin began work on his camp in Minehead. The site opened to the public on 26 May 1962 having cost £2 million to construct. Over the next decade several attractions were added to the site. A miniature railway was added in 1964, chairlifts in 1965, and a monorail in 1967.

Butlin&#x27;s inspiration for his holiday empire had come from a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, when he had been locked out of his B&amp;B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell&#x27;s Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Construction began in the winter and it opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.

==Later life==
Growing up, Butlin had lived with his aunt Jessie in the Swan Pub in Coaley, in his later life he was able to purchase desirable property for himself, for many years living on The Bishops Avenue. His house there was Dane Court in Hampstead, which he purchased in 1947. Also in 1947 he sat on the board of directors of Belle Vue Stadium. Butlin sold Dane Court in 1951, and moved to a property in Grosvenor Square. He remained in this property through the 1950s and 1960s.

Butlin retired in 1969, handing over company operations to his son Bobby. A hostile takeover bid by Phonographic Equipment in November 1969 caused him to come out of retirement, in the capacity of &quot;consultant&quot;. With his father&#x27;s help Bobby fended off the takeover, and Butlin returned to retirement.
In 1972, the Rank Organisation launched a friendly takeover for £43 million (2018:£), which both Butlin and his son agreed to accept.

Butlin&#x27;s retirement was forced by circumstance. His accountant informed Butlin that the total rate of income tax and surtax that Butlin was due to pay for the coming year was 115% of his income. Butlin elected to move from London, becoming a permanent resident in Blair Adam House, Saint John, on the island of Jersey, in the Channel Islands. This move was financially beneficial since Jersey had a fixed 20% rate of income tax. He remained a resident of Jersey until his death on 12 June 1980, aged 80. He is buried in the parish of St John and his grave is shaped to represent a double bed.

Butlin actively engaged in charity work through the Grand Order of Water Rats and through the Variety Club of Great Britain. He was Chief Barker of the Variety Club in 1959, 1966 and 1975. In 1963, he set up the Bill Butlin charitable trust, and in 1966 donated £100,000 (2018:£) to set up a trust to help in cases where police officers were incapacitated or fatally injured while on duty. With public support the fund grew firstly to £250,000 and eventually to over £1 million. In return he received many honours, from having a hybrid tea rose name after him, to his knighthood in 1964. In being knighted, Butlin was following in the footsteps of his great uncle Sir Henry Trentham Butlin, an eminent surgeon. In 1960, Butlin was awarded the Carl Alan award for his services to dance.

==Personal life==
Butlin remained close to his mother, both in following her to Canada and in arranging for her to come home after the death of his stepfather. She died in 1934 and never saw his first holiday camp. By contrast, Butlin makes no mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada. His father remained in Cape Town for the rest of his life, dying in 1954.

In the 1920s while staying in Tiverton in Devon, and working with Marshall Hill, Butlin met Doris &quot;Dolly&quot; Mabel Cheriton, whose family owned the local fish and chip shop; the couple were married in 1927. By the early 1930s the marriage had failed and they separated. Soon after, Butlin met and fell in love with Norah Faith Cheriton, Dolly&#x27;s niece. Dolly refused to grant Butlin a divorce. It was not until Dolly&#x27;s death in 1958 that he and Norah were free to marry. Butlin was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on his wedding day in 1959. The second marriage lasted only a few months, as Butlin had already fallen in love with Sheila Edwina Devine. This time it was Norah who refused to grant him a divorce. In 1975, with divorce laws having changed, Butlin was able to divorce Norah and marry Sheila with whom he remained until his death.

Butlin had two sons and four daughters from his three marriages. Bertha Hill&#x27;s obituary records &quot;William, Dolly and baby Shirley&quot; and on Shirley&#x27;s fifth birthday the local Skegness newspaper noted that she invited many of her friends to her father&#x27;s holiday camp for her party. Little reference is made to her after this time, and her name is not listed on her father&#x27;s grave with her still-living siblings. Sandra died in 1976 at the age of 34 (the same year Butlin&#x27;s second wife Norah died.) William Jr died of cancer in 2003. Robert took over from his father, running the company from 1968 to 1984, and died of lung cancer on 31 December 2008. Jacquie lives on Jersey, where she runs a clothes shop. Jacquie&#x27;s daughter, Laura Emily, was the subject of a court case in the Cayman Islands in 1992, to establish whether she could be a beneficiary of her grandfather&#x27;s estate. Cherie is an actress.

==Media references==
Butlin is listed as a member of the eclectic (and fictional) &quot;orchestra&quot; in the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band&#x27;s recording, &quot;The Intro and the Outro&quot;, where he is credited with playing the spoons. Butlin features as himself in the book &quot;Billy Bunter at Butlins&quot; by Frank Richards (first published 1961). Bunter, Wharton and company head off to Skegness for a holiday at the camp at Butlin&#x27;s invitation.

<text>The land grid array (LGA) is a type of surface-mount packaging for integrated circuits (ICs) that is notable for having the pins on the socket (when a socket is used) — as opposed to pins on the integrated circuit, known as a &quot;pin grid array&quot; (PGA). An LGA can be electrically connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) either by the use of a socket or by soldering directly to the board.

==Description==
The &quot;land grid array&quot; is a packaging technology with a grid of contacts, &#x27;lands&#x27;, on the underside of a package. The contacts are to be connected to a grid of contacts on the PCB. Not all rows and columns of the grid need to be used. The contacts can either be made by using an LGA socket, or by using solder paste. The grid elements found in use can be e.g. circular, triangular or other polygonal shapes and might have even different sizes. Grids might sometimes appear like honey comb patterns. Designs are often optimized for factors like contact likeliness despite tolerances, electrical gap to neighboring contacts and for allowing best shapes for counterpart spring contacts including their outgoing electric connectivity to e.g. a backplane PCB.

LGA packaging is related to ball grid array (BGA) and pin grid array (PGA) packaging. Unlike pin grid arrays, land grid array packages are designed to fit either in a socket, or be soldered down using surface mount technology. PGA packages cannot be soldered down using surface mount technology. In contrast with a BGA, land grid array packages in non socketed configurations have no balls, and use flat contacts which are soldered directly to the PCB. BGA packages, however have balls as their contacts in between the IC and the PCBs. The balls are normally attached to the underside of the IC.

==Use in microprocessors==

LGA has been used for high-end microprocessors and similar applications since the 90s, primarily in Unix workstations. These early uses predate the availability of modern LGA sockets, and instead used land grid arrays on both the processor package and the motherboard. An array of slightly compressible conductive columns held in a frame is then sandwiched between the two LGA surfaces and compressed using the heatsink. This was considered field upgradable by technicians at the time. Care had to be taken to not touch the conductive columns to avoid contamination.

LGA is currently used as a physical interface for microprocessors of the Intel Pentium, Intel Xeon, Intel Core and AMD Opteron, Threadripper, Epyc, and newer Ryzen families. Unlike the pin grid array (PGA) interface found on older AMD and Intel processors, there are no pins on the chip; in place of the pins are pads of bare gold-plated copper that touch protruding pins on the microprocessor&#x27;s connector on the motherboard. Compared to PGA CPUs, LGA reduces the likelihood of the chip being damaged either before or during installation as there are no pins that can be accidentally bent. By transferring the pins to the motherboard, it is possible to design the socket to physically shield the pins from damage, and the costs of installation damage can be mitigated as motherboards tend to be significantly cheaper than CPUs.

While LGA sockets have been in use as early as 1996 by the MIPS R10000, HP PA-8000, and Sun UltraSPARC II processors, the interface did not gain mainstream use until Intel introduced their LGA platform, starting with the 5x0 and 6x0 sequence Pentium 4 (Prescott) in 2004. All Pentium D and Core 2 desktop processors use LGA 775 socket. As of Q1 2006, Intel switched the Xeon server platform to LGA, starting with the 5000-series models. AMD introduced their server LGA platform starting with the 2000-series Opteron in Q2 2006. AMD offered the Athlon 64 FX series on socket 1207FX through ASUS&#x27;s L1N64-SLI WS motherboards. It was the only desktop LGA solution offered by AMD at the time until the release of Socket AM5 in 2022.

The most recent Intel desktop LGA socket is dubbed LGA 1851 (Socket V1), which is used with Intel&#x27;s Arrow Lake series Core Ultra 5, 7, and 9 families. Their Skylake-X Core i7 and Core i9 families use the LGA 2066 socket. The LGA setup provides higher pin densities, allowing more power contacts and thus a more stable power supply to the chip.

AMD introduced its first consumer LGA socket, called Socket TR4 (LGA 4094) for its high end desktop platform Ryzen Threadripper processors. This socket is physically identical to their Socket SP3 for their Epyc server CPUs even though SP3 CPUs are not compatible with the desktop X399 chipset and vice versa.

The previous AMD server LGA socket was designated Socket G34 (LGA 1944). Like Intel, AMD decided to use LGA sockets for their higher pin densities, as a 1944-pin PGA would simply be too large for most motherboards.

===AMD===
*Socket F (LGA 1207)

<text>The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) (RHG/D) is a cavalry regiment of the British Army, part of the Household Cavalry. The Colonel of the Regiment is Anne, Princess Royal. It is the second-most senior regiment in the British Army.

==History==
===Formation and service===
The regiment was formed in 1969 from the merger of the Royal Horse Guards, which was known as &quot;the Blues&quot; or &quot;the Oxford Blues&quot;, and the Royal Dragoons, which was known as &quot;the Royals&quot;. Of these, the Blues were founded as a unit of the New Model Army, having been raised in 1650 by Sir Arthur Haselrig on orders from Oliver Cromwell; it was incorporated into the Restoration army in 1660 and gained the title &quot;Royal&quot; in the 18th century. The Royal Dragoons were formed shortly after the Restoration, in 1661, composed of cavalry veterans of the New Model Army.

Since formation in 1969, the new regiment has served in several countries. From 1969 the regiment had troops deployed to Northern Ireland as part of Operation Banner. In the 1970s and 1980s, during the Cold War, the Regiment was headquartered at Detmold in West Germany and was a unit of the British Army of the Rhine&#x27;s 20th Armoured Brigade, part of the 3rd Armored Division with an armoured and reconnaissance role.

During that time it was tasked with defending part of the North German Plain in the event of an invasion by the Warsaw Pact. During the Falklands War of 1982, the regiment provided the two armoured reconnaissance troops. The regiment also had a squadron on operational duty with the United Nations in Bosnia in 1994–95. Most recently, the regiment saw action in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.

Both Prince William and Prince Harry joined the regiment as cornets in 2006.


===Operational union===
As a result of the Options for Change Review in 1991, The Blues and Royals formed a union for operational purposes with the Life Guards as the Household Cavalry Regiment. However, they each maintain their regimental identity, with distinct uniforms and traditions, and their own colonel. The Blues and Royals currently has two reconnaissance squadrons in Windsor, which are part of the Household Cavalry Regiment, and a mounted squadron in London as part of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, performing ceremonial and public duties.

==Regimental traditions==
Instead of being known as the Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons, the regiment is known as The Blues and Royals and is therefore the only regiment in the British Army to be officially known by its nickname as opposed to its full name.

Newly commissioned officers in the Blues and Royals have the rank of Cornet, rather than Second Lieutenant as is the standard in the rest of the British Army. There is no sergeant rank in the Household Cavalry; the equivalent of a sergeant in another unit is Corporal of Horse; the equivalent of Regimental Sergeant Major is Regimental Corporal Major, etc. King Edward VII established that the rank of private should be replaced by the rank of trooper in the cavalry.

The Blues and Royals is the only regiment in the British Army that allows troopers and non-commissioned officers, when not wearing headdress, to salute an officer. The custom started after the Battle of Warburg in 1760 by John Manners, Marquess of Granby, who commanded both the Royal Horse Guards and the Royal Dragoons, which were separate units at the time. During the battle, the Marquess had driven the French forces from the field, losing both his hat and his wig during the charge. When reporting to his commander, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, in the heat of the moment he is said to have saluted without wearing his headdress, having lost it earlier. When the Marquess of Granby became the Colonel of the Blues, the regiment adopted this tradition.

When the Household Cavalry mounts an escort to the Sovereign on State occasions, a ceremonial axe with a spike is carried by a Farrier Corporal of Horse. The historical reason behind this is that when a horse was wounded or injured so seriously that it could not be treated, its suffering was ended by killing it with the spike. The axe is also a reminder of the days when the Sovereign&#x27;s escorts accompanied royal coaches and when English roads were very bad. Horses often fell, becoming entangled in their harnesses and had to be freed with the cut of an axe. It is also said that in those times, if a horse had to be killed, its rider had to bring back a hoof, cut off with the axe, to prove to the Quartermaster that the animal was dead and hence preventing fraudulent replacement. Today, the axe remains as a symbol of the Farrier&#x27;s duties.

==Uniform==
The Blues and Royals wear their chin strap under their chin, as opposed to the Life Guards, who wear it below their lower lip. On service dress, the Blues and Royals wear a blue lanyard on the left shoulder, as well as a Sam Browne belt containing a whistle. In most dress orders, the Waterloo Eagle is worn on the left arm as part of dress traditions. The Blues and Royals, as part of the Household Division, does not use the Order of the Bath Star for its officer rank &quot;pips&quot;, but rather the Order of the Garter Star.

Prince Harry wore the uniform at the wedding of his brother, Prince William, to Catherine Middleton. Both Prince Harry and Prince William also received permission from the Queen to wear the frock coat version of the uniform to Harry&#x27;s wedding to Meghan Markle.

The modern mess dress worn by officers of the regiment reflects the traditions of the Royal Dragoons and includes a scarlet jacket with dark blue facings.

<doc id="812487" wikidata="Q1158951" url="?curid=812487" title="Dan David Prize">
<text>The Dan David Prize is an international group of awards that recognize and support outstanding contributions to the study of history and other disciplines that shed light on the human past. Nine prizes of $300,000 are awarded each year to outstanding early- and mid-career scholars and practitioners in the historical disciplines. The Prize has an annual purse of $3 million, making it the largest history award in the world, including $300,000 funding an international postdoctoral fellowship program at Tel Aviv University, where the Prize is headquartered. The Prize is endowed by the Dan David Foundation.

Until 2021 the Prize comprised 3 annual prizes of $1 million for innovative and interdisciplinary research in three time dimensions: Past, Present and Future. Prize laureates donated 10 percent of their prize money to doctoral scholarships for outstanding Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholarships in their own field from around the world.

In September 2021, the Dan David Prize announced that it would shift its focus to support the work of &quot;historians, art historians, archaeologists, digital humanists, curators, documentary filmmakers and all those who deepen our knowledge and understanding of the past&quot;.

==History==

The Dan David Foundation was founded in 2000 with a $100 million endowment by Romanian-born Israeli businessman and philanthropist Dan David. The Dan David Prize was founded with the goal of rewarding and encouraging innovative and interdisciplinary research that cuts across traditional boundaries and paradigms. Each year, three prizes of $1 million were awarded in rotating fields to those who made outstanding contributions to humanity.  

In anticipation of the Prize’s 20th anniversary in 2021, the Dan David Prize refocused in a new direction, citing the decline of global investment in the humanities and the relative scarcity of major prizes in the humanities. The redesigned prize focuses on supporting outstanding research in the historical disciplines and celebrating scholars and practitioners whose work illuminates the human past and enriches public debate with a deeper understanding of history.

The Prize announced that starting in 2022 it would award up to nine prizes of $300,000 each year to early- and mid-career scholars and practitioners around the world to recognize significant achievements in the study of the past and support the winners’ future endeavours. From 2022, there will no longer be a distinction between three prize categories.

Laureates include cellist Yo-Yo Ma (2006), Israeli author Amos Oz (2008), U.S. Vice President Al Gore (2008), Canadian author Margaret Atwood (2010), French economist Esther Duflo, and immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci (2021). In 2016, Catherine Hall of University College London rejected the Dan David Prize. Her prize money was donated to fund scholarships at Tel Aviv University.

== Winners (from 2022) ==
From 2022 recipients of the Prize were called winners rather than laureates. The first cohort of Prize winners was announced on March 1, 2022.

<doc id="812521" wikidata="Q2503697" url="?curid=812521" title="Little My">
<text>Little My (original , literally: &quot;Little Mu&quot;) is a character in the Moomin series of books by Tove Jansson. The character first appeared in the fourth book, The Exploits of Moominpappa (1950). She is a small, determined and fiercely independent Mymble. Little My is brash, aggressive, mischievous and disrespectful, but can also be a good friend when she wants to. She is the Mymble&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s younger sister. She was eventually adopted by the Moomin family.

The name originated from the twelfth letter of the Greek alphabet: μ (mu) – transliterated as &quot;my&quot; and pronounced in Swedish. In the metric system, lowercase μ, meaning &quot;one-millionth&quot;, represents the prefix &quot;micro-&quot;, from the Greek (), meaning &quot;small&quot;.

==Personality==
Little My is a very abrasive person who almost always succeeds in persuading her listener or discussion partner. She is an unconventional debater who uses emotion and logic to win arguments. She typically makes a personal attack on the person she is having the discussion with or about, states her own undocumented conclusions, exaggerates her opponents&#x27; arguments to ridicule them, and uses nonverbal effects to show her opponent&#x27;s inferiority.

==Appearances==
Little My appears in the following books:

* &quot;The Exploits of Moominpappa&quot; (Book 4) – Little My is born on a Midsummer&#x27;s Day during Moominpappa&#x27;s youth, and is referred to as the smallest and youngest of all the Mymble&#x27;s children; so small, in fact that you can hardly even see her. She doesn&#x27;t play a very large part in the book, but does on occasion display her fondness for mischief and cheerfully morbid fascination for disaster and destruction.
*&quot;Moominsummer Madness&quot; (Book 5) – In the fifth book, Little My has grown enough to take a more active part in the plot, though she is still small enough that Snufkin can carry her in his pocket. She is now in the care of her older sister, The Mymble&#x27;s daughter, who tries unsuccessfully to teach her good behavior, but is separated from the others during the course of the plot and ends up being rescued by Snufkin, whom she accompanies for most of the rest of the book as he battles a rule-obsessed Park Keeper and ends up unwittingly &quot;rescuing&quot; a group of other children as well.
*&quot;Moominland Midwinter&quot; (Book 6) – Little My is the only character, apart from Moomintroll, who wakes from hibernation and gets to experience winter for the first time. Unlike him, she immediately finds this &quot;new, ice-cold world&quot; to be great fun, especially after she discovers winter sports.
*&quot;Tales from Moominvalley&quot; (Book 7) – This book consists of several short stories, three of which feature Little My: &quot;A Tale of Horror&quot;, in which she tells tall tales of terror and doom to the Next-to-youngest-Whomper; &quot;The Last Dragon on Earth&quot;, in which she basically plays the nosy, sarcastic, and insensitive younger sibling to Moomintroll (though actually being older than him); and &quot;The Invisible Child&quot;, in which she demonstrates her own ideas about how to help the invisible Ninny become visible again.
*&quot;Moominpappa at Sea&quot; (Book 8) – Little My accompanies the Moomin family to the lighthouse island and is a constant presence in the book. Again, she is the only character who instantly takes to the new life and remains cheerful throughout.

In addition, Little My plays major roles in the picture-books &quot;The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My&quot; and &quot;An Unwanted Guest&quot;, has a brief speaking role in &quot;The Dangerous Journey&quot;, and makes a silent (and unmentioned by the narrative) cameo in one of the illustrations in &quot;Who Will Comfort Toffle?&quot;. She is also mentioned a number of times in &quot;Moominvalley in November&quot;, but since this book takes place roughly at the same time as the trip to the lighthouse island in &quot;Moominpappa at Sea&quot;, she doesn&#x27;t actually appear in person.

She also shows up as a major character in most Moomin-related media, comics, movies, and TV series.

<text>Trinidad and Tobago cuisine is influenced by Indian-South Asian, West African, Creole, European, North American, Chinese, Amerindian, Latin American, and Levantine culinary styles.

==Main meals==

===Breakfast dishes===


Popular breakfast foods include doubles, made with two &quot;baras&quot; (flat fried dough) and curried &quot;channa&quot; (chickpeas). They are usually served with toppings such as pepper sauce, kuchela, tamarind, mango, pommecythere, cucumber, and bandhaniya chutneys. Doubles are one of the most popular breakfast foods eaten on the islands, but are commonly consumed throughout the day.

A traditional Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian breakfast consists of &quot;sada roti&quot;, a type of unleavened bread made with flour, baking powder and water. The dough is rolled out and cooked on flat, cast-iron skillet called a &quot;tawa&quot;. The cooked dough is cut into quarters and served with a variety of fried vegetables, tarkaris or chokhas. Sada rotis are usually eaten with &quot;baigan chokha&quot; (roasted and mashed eggplant), &quot;damadol chokha&quot; (roasted and mashed tomatoes) and &quot;pepper chokha&quot; (roasted and mashed peppers). 

Other common dishes include &quot;aloo chokha&quot; (boiled, roasted, and mashed potatoes), &quot;karaili chokha&quot; (roasted and mashed bittermelon) and &quot;murtani&quot; or &quot;upar ghar&quot; (combination of roasted and mashed eggplant, tomato, pepper, and okra); fried or curried &quot;bodi&quot; (long beans), aloo (potatoes), ochro/bhindhi (okra), &quot;seim&quot; (hyacinth beans); fried or curried &quot;karaili&quot; (bittermelon), &quot;saijan&quot; (drumstick) and &quot;lauki&quot; (bottle gourd), pumpkin or &quot;kohra&quot; &quot;tarkari&quot; (pumpkin simmered with spices and seasoning); and &quot;bhaji&quot; (made with young dasheen bush (taro) leaves, spinach leaves, saijan (drumstick) leaves, or chaurai (spiny amaranth) leaves), and/or fried plantains.

Fried bake (a fried unleavened bread) is usually served with fried shark, saltfish (dried and salted cod), &quot;buljol&quot; (saltfish with fresh sweet peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and sometimes boiled eggs), sardines, herring (smoked, salted, and dried fish), bacon, fried plantain, brown stew chicken, or corned beef with onions and tomatoes.

Coconut bake (coconut bread) is usually served with fried accra (saltfish fritters), buljol, black pudding, butter, cheese paste (a mixture of cheese, butter, mustard, grated onion, mayonnaise and green seasoning) or stewed meat, like chicken.

Bake and shark is a popular breakfast dish at local beaches, like Maracas Beach (Trinidad) and Store Bay (Tobago), especially on the weekend.

Other breakfast foods include tannia cakes (fried dasheen cake), and boiled cassava with butter.

Common hot drinks consumed for breakfast include cocoa tea (hot chocolate) made from homemade cocoa balls, cornmeal porridge and farine (an Amerindian treat).

===Lunch and dinner===

A very popular and nationally well known dish with distinctly African roots is callaloo, a side dish made of young dasheen or taro leaves, okra, crab or pigtails, pumpkin, onions, coconut milk, pimento, and green seasoning like chives, cilantro and culantro. Callaloo is often served with cornmeal coo coo, plantain, cassava, sweet potatoes, dumplings, rice, and curried crab. However Trinbagonian callaloo isn&#x27;t prepared or served the same as Jamaican callaloo.

Pelau is a very popular rice-based dish in Trinidad and Tobago. As well as dhal and rice, rice and stewed chicken, pork, ox-tail, fish or lamb. Also popular are breadfruit oil downs and the macaroni pie, a macaroni pasta bake. Which consists of eggs and cheese, and a variety of other potential ingredients that can change according to the recipe being used. 

One of the most popular Trinidadian dishes is curried duck served with either roti or rice. Local curried duck cooking competitions are often held with multiple variations being created. A simple dish to make, but difficult to master, curried Muscovy is regarded as a delicacy which can be served at all times.

An array of fish and seafood can be bought at local merchants throughout Trinidad and Tobago, such as flying fish, king fish, carite, prawns, sapatay, red fish, shrimp, bonito, lobster, conch and crab, tilapia and seasonal cascadura. 

Tobagonian food is dominated by a wide selection of seafood dishes, most notably, curried crab and dumplings. Tobago is also known for its sumptuously prepared provisions, such as dasheen (taro root), sweet potato, eddoe, cassava, yam, soups and stews, also known as &quot;blue food&quot; across the country. &quot;Fish broth&quot; a soup made in the style of Bouillabaisse is quite popular as a main dish or as a side. 

Another local dish is the rare delicacy cascadu (cascadura), which is a small, freshwater fish. The fish is curried and served with lagoon rice and cassava and yams. There is a local legend in Trinidad that s/he who eats cascadu will return to Trinidad to end their days.

===Condiments===

Trinidadians accompany their meals with various condiments; these can include pepper sauces, chutneys and pickles and are often homemade.

Pepper sauces are made by using scotch bonnet or other hot peppers, either minced or chopped and other spices. It can sometimes include lime or lemon as well as other vegetables, and come in many variations and flavours. The murtanie (mother-in-law) is another popular condiment which is a coarsely chopped spicy medley of scotch bonnet peppers, carrots, &quot;karaili&quot; (bitter melon) and other spices.

<text>Price look-up codes, commonly called PLU codes, PLU numbers, PLUs, produce codes, or produce labels, are a system of numbers that uniquely identify bulk produce sold in grocery stores and supermarkets. The codes have been in use since 1990, and over 1400 have been assigned. The codes are administered by the International Federation for Produce Standards (IFPS), a global coalition of fruit and vegetable associations that was formed in 2001 to introduce PLU numbers globally.

Produce labeled with PLU codes eliminates the need for grocery store checkers and customers to visually identify different varieties, which can make check-out and inventory control easier, faster, and more accuratesomething that is important when varieties of produce look similar but have different prices, such as organic and conventional (non-organic) varieties.

==Uses==
PLU codes are used primarily in retail grocery stores or supermarkets, where they are keyed into point of sale systems by cashiers or by customers at self checkout machines when the produce is being weighed or counted. The codes may be printed on small stickers, tags, or bands that are affixed to produce, or may be printed on signs. Since 2006, stickers with PLU codes may also have a GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional barcode.

==Numbering conventions==
Conventional produce is randomly assigned four-digit PLU codes in the 3000 and 4000 series. Organic produce may be designated by prefixing the four-digit conventional PLU with a 9.

Numbers 83000-84999 were supposed to be used for GMO productions, but they were opened for general use after GMO growers declined to use them.

===Retailer-assigned codes===
Some PLU code ranges are reserved for retailers. This allows codes to be defined by individual retailers or location, and allows the use of PLU codes in lieu of barcodes. There are retailer-assigned ranges for general and category-specific use. For example, 3170–3269 can be assigned by retailers to any goods, while 4193–4217 can only be assigned to apples.

Suppliers may coordinate with their retailers to use the same code in the retailer-assigned range for a specific product.

==Promotion via PLU stickers==
Some producers have obtained a license to place characters on stickers on PLU code labels, often as a promotion for a movie, television show or other media franchise. For example, Imagination Farms has marketed produce with collectible Disney character stickers such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo under the Disney Garden brand, and Chiquita has marketed bananas with Minions stickers on them, along with a competition.

== Collecting ==
Although the collecting of PLU labels as a hobby already existed for a while, it became widespread through social media presence and fashion designs that use fruit stickers. The popularity of the hobby was further increased by online catalogs and collector clubs.

In addition to illustrations, important factors for collectors are compositions of these stickers and the type of product they are used on. Most popular materials for creating PLU code stickers are plastic film and paper, however cardboard, metallized film, wrapping tissue, and textiles are also known to be used.

== Environmental concerns ==
Although PLU labels are recognized globally and most chain supermarkets use them, they sometimes cause rejection of the fruits and vegetables they are attached to from being accepted for composting disposal. Generally, they are not made of biodegradable material.

<text>The International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), based in London, United Kingdom, is a consortium of the world&#x27;s major news agencies, other news providers and news industry vendors and acts as the global standards body of the news media.

Currently more than 50 companies and organizations from the news industry are members of the IPTC, including global players like Associated Press (AP), Agence France-Presse (AFP), Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), BBC, Getty Images, Press Association (PA), Reuters and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

IPTC aims at simplifying the distribution of information. To achieve this technical standards are developed to improve the management and exchange of information between content providers, intermediaries and consumers.
IPTC is committed to open standards and makes all standards freely available to its members and the wider community.

The IPTC was established in 1965 by a group of news organisations including the Alliance Européenne des Agences de Presse (EANA), American Newspaper Publishers Association (then ANPA, now NAA), Fédération Internationale des Editeurs de Journaux (now WAN-IFRA) and the North American News Agencies (a joint committee of Associated Press, Canadian Press and United Press International) to safeguard the telecommunications interests of the world&#x27;s press.

== IPTC Standards ==

=== Photo metadata ===

The IPTC defined a set of metadata properties that can be applied to images, part of a broader standard developed in the early 1990s and known as the IPTC Information Interchange Model (IIM). Embedded IIM image information is often referred to as an &quot;IPTC header&quot;. This basic set of metadata fields is branded as &quot;IPTC Core&quot;, in 2008 a second set branded as &quot;IPTC Extension&quot; was developed.

The Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) has largely superseded IIM&#x27;s image file header structure, but the properties of the IPTC Core are synchronized between the technical structures of XMP and IIM by a vast majority of imaging software.

Because of its nearly universal acceptance among photographers — even amateurs — this is by far IPTC&#x27;s most widely used standard.

=== IPTC NewsML-G2-Standards Family ===
Using XML and the W3C&#x27;s model for the Semantic Web, in 2008 IPTC launched a new series of standards that feature modular construction and many opportunities for embedding metadata. This allows developers to build applications that use only the parts of the IPTC NewsML-G2-Standards that are required by the customer, and that reduce programming costs by re-using XML and metadata modules. Further the NewsML-G2-Standards extend the scope of exchange formats beyond news content, they include event data and well organised information about persons, organisations, points of interest, geopolitical areas or abstract concepts.

These members of the family of standards are available now: NewsML-G2, EventsML-G2 and SportsML-G2. Although they have different roles within the news industry they share much of the date model and the same XML coding.

====NewsML-G2====
NewsML-G2 acts as an envelope and organizer so that news providers can create single news items — text, photos, video or anything else — and bundle them into concise cohesive packages than can be automatically processed by web CMSs or newsroom systems. The content and relationships of the individual news items can be described using a rich set of metadata.

NewsML-G2 is not a text or image mark-up format. For example, it does not contain paragraph or headline tagging. Rather, it is an envelope and organizer that does not, by itself, act as a content format. For text article formatting, IPTC mentions News Industry Text Format (NITF) or XHTML as common examples.

NewsML-G2 is used by several large international news agencies, including Agence France-Presse, Associated Press, Austria Presse Agentur, Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Fourth Estate, Thomson Reuters, and others.

====EventsML-G2====
EventsML-G2 optimises the sharing of event information such as meetings, sports events, elections, and even rocket launches — virtually any announced activity that can be broadly classified as an &quot;event.&quot; Using XML and metadata, EventsML-G2 allows news providers to create rich descriptions of events plus information about planned coverage, and then share that information with web sites, databases, newsrooms or other customers.

EventsML-G2 is not a calendaring standard, but rather a way for news agencies to share event information to populate their own calendars. The events need not have fixed starting or ending dates, nor do they even need to have a fixed length.

====SportsML-G2====
SportsML-G2 is a convenient way to share sports statistics in a concise, unambiguous way. All major sports are supported, and certain sports that are known for rich or especially complex statistics (such as baseball) can use special add-on modules. SportsML-G2 has found wide usage outside the news industry; among the user communities are sports teams, fantasy sports leagues, sports betting firms and sports historians. SportsML-G2 is the newer sibling of SportsML.

Version 2.0 of SportsML-G2 was released in October 2008.

=== NewsCodes ===

NewsCodes is the brand name of the set of Controlled Vocabularies created and maintained by IPTC. One group of NewsCodes can be used to classify news content - regardless of the media type - and another set is used to support the functionality of IPTC&#x27;s news exchange format standards.

==== Media Topics ====

The Media Topics is the IPTC&#x27;s recommended controlled vocabulary for classifying media content by topic. Around 1,200 terms in a hierarchy describe the subject of news content in a generic, international way. The IPTC created Media Topics in 2010 as a successor to the IPTC&#x27;S previous subject taxonomy, SubjectCodes.

The Media Topics vocabulary is actively maintained by the IPTC NewsCodes Working Group. Updates are released every two to three months including new terms and clarifications to existing terms.

Translations of the Media Topics vocabulary are available in 12 languages and language variants: American English (en-US), Arabic (ar), Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR), British English (en-GB), Danish (dk), French (fr), German (de), Norwegian (no), Portuguese (pt-PT), Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans), Spanish (es) and Swedish (se).

===NewsML 1===
NewsML 1 is an XML standard developed by the IPTC to provide a media-independent, structural enveloping framework for multi-media news.

It has also been adopted as Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) X7201:2005.

Although superseded in 2008 by NewsML-G2, NewsML 1 (as the original NewsML is now known) remains popular outside North America (especially in Asia) and IPTC plans to support this standard as &quot;NewsML 1.x&quot; indefinitely.

===ninjs===
ninjs standardizes the representation of news in JSON - a data interchange format. The format covers the data interchange by APIs and documents in content management systems like search engines.

===NITF - News Industry Text Format===
News Industry Text Format (NITF) is an XML specification published by the IPTC that is designed to standardize the content and structure of text-based news articles.

===RightsML===
RightsML is IPTC&#x27;s Rights Expression Language for news media and is based on ODRL.

===rNews===
rNews is a standard for using semantic markup to annotate online news. It defines a data model for embedding machine-readable publishing metadata in web documents and a set of suggested implementations. Some properties of this standard have been adopted by Schema.org for its metadata schema.

===SportsML===
SportsML is an XML news exchange standard for sharing sports statistics in a concise, unambiguous way. All major sports are supported, and certain sports that are known for rich or especially complex statistics (such as baseball) can use special add-on modules. SportsML has found wide usage outside the news industry; among the user communities are sports teams, fantasy sports leagues, sports betting firms and sports historians.

In June 2008, the IPTC approved SportsML-G2 as a parallel standard to SportsML. Although SportsML-G2 is built from standardized XML modules that are used by other IPTC G2 standards, both standards effectively accomplish the same task.

===IPTC 7901===
IPTC 7901 is still a widely used format for plain text news, despite being 30 years old. It is a close relative of the Newspaper Association of America North American standard ANPA-1312, and uses similar control and other special characters to create a file that can be used to drive computerized news editing systems, photo typesetters or even teleprinter machines.

<text>The FUs are a hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts. They formed in 1981 as a three-piece band, released three records and appeared on the compilation &quot;This Is Boston, Not LA&quot; before changing their name to Straw Dogs in 1986 to market themselves as a heavy metal act. In 2010 The FUs reformed under their original moniker.

==History==

===Formation and early records===
The FUs formed as a hardcore punk band in Boston late in 1981. The band initially consisted of John Sox on bass and lead vocals, Bob Furapples on drums, and Steve Grimes on guitar. This line-up recorded a four-song demo which received airplay on the numerous college radio stations in the Boston area.

The FUs started out playing fast, thrashy hardcore punk. In 1982 Wayne Maestri was recruited to take over bass guitar, and this four-piece line-up recorded tracks for the Modern Method compilation, &quot;This Is Boston, Not LA&quot;, which also featured tracks by Gang Green, Jerry&#x27;s Kids and The Freeze. A companion 7-inch EP, &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, included another FUs&#x27; track.

Later the same year, FUs‘ debut album, &quot;Kill For Christ&quot;, was released on Xclaim Records, featuring cover artwork by Septic Death frontman Brian &#x27;Pushead&#x27; Schroeder, depicting Jesus with a machine gun. Their second album for Xclaim, &quot;My America&quot;, came out in 1983, and the band&#x27;s final album as The FUs, &quot;Do We Really Want To Hurt You?&quot; followed in 1984, on Gasatanka/Enigma.

===Political controversy===

During the heyday of political hardcore punk of the early 1980s, The FUs ran afoul of Tim Yohannan, founder and editor of &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot;. Yohannan and others found the patriotic lyrics and artwork on &quot;My America&quot; to be emblems of right wing nationalism. Drummer and songwriter Bob Furapples noted that &quot;MRR&#x27;s&quot; negative publicity had adversely impacted the band&#x27;s record sales, particularly in Europe. Satirical punk band The Dead Milkmen poked fun at the band&#x27;s supposed right-wing views on their song &quot;Tiny Town&quot; on the album &quot;Big Lizard in My Backyard&quot;.

FUs lyricist Jon Sox has said in writing &quot;My America,&quot; He &quot;wanted to get a reaction.&quot; Sox writes: &quot;On our first tour I encountered lots of young kids who had their entire lives in front of them. A lot of them had turned to hard drugs. I was looking for a shocking way to say, &#x27;Yeah, America has its problems but destroying yourself isn&#x27;t helping.&#x27; It had to be high impact because I saw a crisis looming.&quot;

===Straw Dogs===

After the release of the third FUs album, the band had begun to take a more aggressive rock direction, favoring &quot;punk&quot; without the label of &quot;hardcore.&quot; The changes were taken further when the band changed its name to Straw Dogs, with guitarist Steve Martin and drummer Chris &quot;Bones&quot; Jones added to the line-up. As Straw Dogs, the band released an EP followed by two albums. Drummer Jones died in a car crash the day after the debut Straw Dogs LP was released. The EP and first LP, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; and &quot;We Are Not Amused&quot;, respectively, were released on the Restless/Enigma label. The third album Your Own Worst Nightmare was released by Lone Wolf Records, an independent label from Toronto. European re-releases came from German label, Lost and Found Records, some of which were authorised by the band.

===Reissues and reunions===

The FUs material was re-released on Classy Records and then on Taang! Records. In 2002 Reflex/Wolfpack Records re-released both &quot;Kill For Christ&quot; and &quot;My America&quot; on one LP.

John Sox reintroduced the music of FUs and Straw Dogs by forming the band Payload! in 2006 with Richie Rich, Bobby Frankenheim (who later joined the reunited DYS), Jack Snyder currently of Wrought Iron Hex, and Mick Stunt, currently of the West Coast band, The Stuntmen. When approached by Katie Goldman of Gallery East to participate in an upcoming documentary called &quot;xxx ALL AGES xxx&quot; Sox decided to reunite all of the original members with members of Payload! to form the first hardcore supergroup for lack of a better term. Sharing the stage for a live show (as mentioned in the press release) at Club Lido in Revere were, Sox, Grimes, Furapples, Maestri, Rich, and Stunt.

The FUs performed a reunion show in the Boston area on August 29, 2010, along with fellow Boston pioneer hardcore punk bands DYS, Jerry&#x27;s Kids, and Gang Green as well as New York City&#x27;s Antidote. The show was in support of &quot;xxx ALL AGES xxx&quot;, a documentary about the original hardcore punk scene in Boston in the early 1980s, being produced in association with Stone Films NYC.

The reunited band has followed the Club Lido show with gigs in New England, and returned to the studio to record a song for a compilation called &quot;Cashing in on Christmas Vol. III&quot; for Black Hole Records.

The reborn FUs continue to play extensively in New England and have completed tours to Europe including the festivals Rebellion and Bloodstains in the UK and Ieper Hardcore Fest in Belgium, and in the US to the mid-atlantic states and the West Coast including an appearance in the Punk Rock Bowling Festival, held annually in Las Vegas.

The current line-up is John Sox, vocals, Steve Grimes, lead guitar, backup vocals, Ian King, second guitar, backup vocals, Jimmy Foul, bass, backup vocals, and Bob Furapples, drums.

<text>In number theory, a prime quadruplet (sometimes called a prime quadruple) is a set of four prime numbers of the form This represents the closest possible grouping of four primes larger than 3, and is the only prime constellation of length 4.

== Prime quadruplets ==
The first eight prime quadruplets are:

All prime quadruplets except are of the form for some integer . (This structure is necessary to ensure that none of the four primes are divisible by 2, 3 or 5). A prime quadruplet of this form is also called a prime decade.

All such prime decades have centers of form 210n + 15, 210n + 105, and 210n + 195 since the centers must be -1, 0, or +1 modulo 7. The +15 form may also give rise to a (high) prime quintuplet; the +195 form can also give rise to a (low) quintuplet; while the +105 form can yield both types of quintuplets and possibly prime sextuplets. It is no accident that each prime in a prime decade is displaced from its center by a power of 2, actually 2 or 4, since all centers are odd and divisible by both 3 and 5.

A prime quadruplet can be described as a consecutive pair of twin primes, two overlapping sets of prime triplets, or two intermixed pairs of sexy primes. These &quot;quad&quot; primes 11 or above also form the core of prime quintuplets and prime sextuplets by adding or subtracting 8 from their respective centers.

It is not known if there are infinitely many prime quadruplets. A proof that there are infinitely many would imply the twin prime conjecture, but it is consistent with current knowledge that there may be infinitely many pairs of twin primes and only finitely many prime quadruplets. The number of prime quadruplets with digits in base 10 for is 
:1, 3, 7, 27, 128, 733, 3869, 23620, 152141, 1028789, 7188960, 51672312, 381226246, 2873279651 .

 the largest known prime quadruplet has 10132 digits. It starts with , found by Peter Kaiser.

The constant representing the sum of the reciprocals of all prime quadruplets, Brun&#x27;s constant for prime quadruplets, denoted by , is the sum of the reciprocals of all prime quadruplets:

formula_1

with value:

: = 0.87058 83800 ± 0.00000 00005. 

This constant should not be confused with the Brun&#x27;s constant for cousin primes, prime pairs of the form , which is also written as .

The prime quadruplet {11, 13, 17, 19} is alleged to appear on the Ishango bone although this is disputed.

Excluding the first prime quadruplet, the shortest possible distance between two quadruplets and is  = 30. The first occurrences of this are for = 1006301, 2594951, 3919211, 9600551, 10531061, ... ().

The Skewes number for prime quadruplets is 1172531 ().

==Prime quintuplets==
If is a prime quadruplet and or is also prime, then the five primes form a prime quintuplet which is the closest admissible constellation of five primes. The first few prime quintuplets with are:

The first prime quintuplets with are:

A prime quintuplet contains two close pairs of twin primes, a prime quadruplet, and three overlapping prime triplets.

It is not known if there are infinitely many prime quintuplets. Once again, proving the twin prime conjecture might not necessarily prove that there are also infinitely many prime quintuplets. Also, proving that there are infinitely many prime quadruplets might not necessarily prove that there are infinitely many prime quintuplets.

The Skewes number for prime quintuplets is 21432401 ().

==Prime sextuplets==

If both and are prime then it becomes a prime sextuplet. The first few:

Some sources also call a prime sextuplet. Our definition, all cases of primes follows from defining a prime sextuplet as the closest admissible constellation of six primes. 

A prime sextuplet contains two close pairs of twin primes, a prime quadruplet, four overlapping prime triplets, and two overlapping prime quintuplets.

All prime sextuplets except are of the form formula_2for some integer . (This structure is necessary to ensure that none of the six primes is divisible by ).

It is not known if there are infinitely many prime sextuplets. Once again, proving the twin prime conjecture might not necessarily prove that there are also infinitely many prime sextuplets. Also, proving that there are infinitely many prime quintuplets might not necessarily prove that there are infinitely many prime sextuplets.

The Skewes number for the tuplet is 251331775687 ().

==Prime k-tuples==
Prime quadruplets, quintuplets, and sextuplets are examples of prime constellations, and prime constellations are in turn examples of prime -tuples. A prime constellation is a grouping of primes, with minimum prime and maximum prime , meeting the following two conditions:

* Not all residues modulo are represented for any prime 
* For any given , the value of is the minimum possible

More generally, a prime -tuple occurs if the first condition but not necessarily the second condition is met.

<text>Sir Ti-liang Yang, (; 30 June 1929 – 24 June 2023) was a Hong Kong judge. He was the Chief Justice of Hong Kong from 1988 to 1996, the only ethnic Chinese person to hold this office during British colonial rule.

Yang was a candidate in the 1996 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, where he lost to his opponent Tung Chee-Hwa. After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, he was appointed a non-official member of the Executive Council by Tung and retired in 2002. In retirement, he mainly focused on writing and teaching English. In September 2003, he became the host of a RTHK radio programme, &quot;Yang Ti-liang Mail Box&quot; (), teaching English grammar. Yang died on 24 June 2023, at the age of 93.

== Early life ==
Yang was born in Shanghai on 30 June 1929. He attended St. John&#x27;s Middle School (same foundation as St. John&#x27;s University) in his early years and read law in the Comparative Law School of China in Soochow University Law School in Shanghai from 1946 to 1949. Due to the Chinese Civil War, he moved very briefly to Hong Kong before graduating, where he stayed at St. John&#x27;s Hall in 1949. Then he moved to England to read law at University College London, where he graduated with an LLB with honours in 1953. In 1954, he was called to the bar with honours at Gray&#x27;s Inn. After studying in England, Yang returned to Hong Kong in 1955.

==Judicial career==
In June 1956, Yang was offered a post as magistrate, which he accepted, and, in 1963, he was promoted to senior magistrate. Yang was acting District Judge from 1964 to 1968. During that period, he was chairman of the Kowloon Disturbances Claims Assessment Board and following the 1967 Leftist Riots, he also presided over the Compensation Board. In 1968, he was appointed District Judge of the Victoria District Court and was made a member of the Chinese Language Committee and president of the Legal Sub-Committee in 1970. Yang was, for a brief period in 1971, acting Puisne Judge.

In 1972, he was appointed Commissioner of Inquiry into the Rainstorm Disasters. On 17 February 1975, he presided over the watershed corruption trial of Peter Fitzroy Godber, a former Kowloon Deputy District Commissioner of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. Yang sentenced him to four years&#x27; imprisonment after a six-day trial. That same year, Yang was promoted to Judge of the High Court of Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. In 1976, he chaired the Commission of Inquiry into the Leung Wing-sang case in which a station sergeant, Lau Cheong-wah, allegedly induced Leung with HK$10,000 to confess to wounding another person. In 1980, Yang was chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the apparent suicide of Inspector John MacLennan.

Yang was appointed a Justice of Appeal in 1981 and, six years later, Vice-President. In March 1988, Yang was appointed Chief Justice of Hong Kong (the then chief judge of the Court of Appeal) following recommendation of the Governor Sir David Wilson. This was the first time an ethnic Chinese had held this office. Prior to the appointment, he also received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in the New Year Honours List. According to customary practice, Chief Justices of Hong Kong would also become Chief Justice of Brunei Darussalam. Yang&#x27;s predecessor, however, Sir Denys Tudor Emil Roberts, continued to serve as Chief Justice of Brunei Darussalam after his retirement. Sir TL was instead appointed president of the Court of Appeal of Brunei on 24 May 1988.

==Chief Executive election==
In 1996, Yang tendered his resignation to then governor Chris Patten in order to clear the way for his candidacy in the first ever Chief Executive election. In addition, he renounced his British citizenship and wrote a letter to Queen Elizabeth II to give up his knighthood. Before the election, he organised a series of campaigns, including visiting public housing estates, and travelled on the Mass Transit Railway subway system for the first time in his life. On 11 December 1996, the small-circle Election Committee selected Tung Chee Hwa, a shipping magnate, over Yang to be Chief Executive. The vote was 320 to 42.

Yang was appointed a Non-Official Member of the Executive Council by Tung soon after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. During his tenure in the Council, he was chairman of the Exchange Fund Investment Ltd from 1998 to 2002 and was responsible to the management of the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong. From 1999 to 2004, he was also chairman of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Complaints Committee.

==Public service==
From 1981 to 1984, Yang was chairman of the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee. From 1985 to 2001, he was chairman of the University of Hong Kong Council. He was also Pro-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong from 1994 to 2001. In 2000, during his Pro-Chancellorship, he was designated by the university to investigate the Public Opinion Programme Disputes.

In 1988, he was elected an Honorary Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn. He served as President of the Bentham Club at University College London in 1991. From 1998 to 2012, he was chairman of the Hong Kong Red Cross; in June 2012, he assumed the honorary position of President.

After retiring from the Executive Council in 2002, Yang spent much of his time teaching English grammar and etiquette. In September 2003, he hosted a Radio Television Hong Kong radio programme, &quot;Yang Ti-liang Mail Box&quot; (), teaching English grammar and answering questions on his website. He was honorary professor of Chinese at the University of Hong Kong from 1998. In 2005, he was appointed honorary professor and chairman of the Executive Committee of the School of Law by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2006, he was made honorary professor of Social Sciences at the Open University of Hong Kong.


==Translated works==
Yang translated Chinese classics into English, including:
*&quot;General Yue Fei&quot;, 1995 ()
*&quot;The Peach Blossom Fan&quot;, 1998 ()
*&quot;Officialdom Unmasked&quot;, 2001 ()

==Honours==
He was knighted in 1988. He was appointed a Justice of Peace from 1 July 1998 to 2012. On 15 July 1990, he was awarded the Order of Seri Paduka Mahkota Brunei First Class by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. He was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal by the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1999 to acknowledge his contribution to justice and higher education in Hong Kong.

<text>The Brenta is an Italian river that runs from Trentino to the Adriatic Sea just south of the Venetian lagoon in the Veneto region, in the north-east of Italy.

During the Roman era, it was called Medoacus (Ancient Greek: &quot;Mediochos&quot;, &quot;Μηδειοχος&quot;) and near Padua it divided in two branches, Medoacus Maior (Greater Medoacus) and Medoacus Minor (Lesser Medoacus). The river changed its course in the early Middle Ages, and its former bed through Padua was occupied by the Bacchiglione.

It is long and was first channelled in the 16th century when a long canal was built from the village of Stra to the Adriatic Sea, bypassing the Venetian lagoon. A branch of the Brenta, named &quot;Naviglio del Brenta&quot;, was left to connect directly Venice and Padua (which was a kind of second capital of the Venice Republic). It runs through Stra, Fiesso d&#x27;Artico, Dolo, Mira, Oriago and Malcontenta to Fusina (which is part of the comune of Venice).

Starting in the 16th century, many large villas were built along the shores of the &quot;Naviglio del Brenta&quot;, and this inhabited area was subsequently named &quot;Riviera del Brenta&quot;. Three of these villas are open to the public: the massive baroque Villa Pisani in Stra, Villa Widmann-Foscari in Mira, and the Palladian building of Villa Foscari, also called &quot;La Malcontenta&quot;. Villa Ferretti-Angeli in Dolo is also on the Riviera. Northwest of Padua, near the village of Piazzola sul Brenta, not far from the river, Villa Contarini is open. The Venetian aristocracy used to cruise along the canal on a type of boat known as a &quot;burchiello&quot;, while cargo was carried on traditional barges known as &quot;burci&quot;.

In Bassano del Grappa, the river is crossed by the &quot;Ponte Vecchio&quot; (Italian, meaning Old bridge), or &quot;Ponte degli Alpini&quot; (bridge of the Alpini), a covered bridge designed by Palladio in 1569. The bridge is pontoon-style and is built completely of wood. It was destroyed several times in its history, and was last rebuilt by the Alpini in 1948.

<text>Bimbisāra (in Buddhist tradition) or Shrenika () and Seniya () in the Jain histories ( or ) was
the King of Magadha ( or ) and belonged to the Haryanka dynasty. He was the son of Bhattiya. His expansion of the kingdom, especially his annexation of the kingdom of Anga to the east, is considered to have laid the foundations for the later expansion of the Mauryan Empire.

According to Jain Tradition, he is said to be the first Tirthankara (&quot;will be named as Padmanabha / Mahapadma&quot;) out of 24th Tirthankara of the future cosmic age. He frequently visited Samavasarana of Lord Mahavira seeking answers to his queries.

According to Buddhist Tradition, he is also known for his cultural achievements and was a great friend and protector of the Buddha. According to the 7th century Chinese monk Xuanzang, Bimbisara built the city of Rajgir (Rajagriha). He was succeeded on the throne by his son Ajatashatru.

==Life==
Bimbisara was the son of Bhattiya, a chieftain. He ascended to throne at the age of 15 in 543 BCE. He established the Haryanka dynasty and laid the foundations of Magadha with the fortification of a village, which later became the city of Pataliputra. Bimbisara&#x27;s first capital was at &quot;Girivraja&quot; (identified with Rajagriha). He led a military campaign against Anga, perhaps to avenge his father&#x27;s earlier defeat at the hands of its king, &quot;Brahmadatta&quot;. The campaign was successful, Anga was annexed, and prince &quot;Kunika&quot; (Ajatashatru) was appointed governor at Champa. His conquest of Anga gave Magadha control over the routes to the Ganges Delta, which had important ports that gave access to the eastern coast of India. Pukkusati, the king of Gandhara, sent Bimbisara an embassy.

His court is said to have included Sona Kolivisa, Sumana (flower gatherer), Koliya (minister), Kumbhaghosaka (treasurer) and Jivaka (physician).

===Marriage alliances===
Bimbisara used marriage alliances to strengthen his position. His first wife was Kosala Devi, the daughter of Mahā Kosala, the king of Kosala, and a sister of Prasenajit. His bride brought him Kashi as dowry. This marriage also ended the hostility between Magadha and Kosala and gave him a free hand in dealing with the other states. His second wife, Chellana, was a Licchavi princess from Vaishali and daughter of the Jain king Chetaka. His third wife, &quot;Kshema&quot;, was a daughter of the chief of the Madra clan of Punjab. &quot;Mahavagga&quot; depicts him having 500 wives.

==== Death ====

As per Buddhism, due to influence by Devadatta (a Buddhist monk), Bimbisāra was assassinated by his son Ajatashatru in , who then succeeded him to the throne. However, as per Jainism, Bimbisāra committed suicide.

==Traditional accounts==
=== Jainism ===
Bimbisara is referred to as Shrenika of Rajgir in Jain literature who became a devotee of Jainism impressed by the calmness of Jain Muni Yamadhar. He frequently visited Samavasarana of Mahavira seeking answers to his queries. He asked about the jain Ramayana and an illuminating sage (King Prasana). He is said to be a &quot;Balabhadra&quot; in one of his previous lives. 

Per Jain Scripture, Bimbisara killed himself in a fit of passion, after his son had imprisoned him. Consequently, he was reborn in hell, where he is currently residing, until the karma which led to his birth there comes to an end. It is further written, that he will be reborn as &quot;Mahapadma&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Padmanabha&quot;), the first in the chain of future tirthankaras who are to rise at the beginning of the upward motion (&quot;Utsarpini&quot;) of the next era of time.

=== Buddhism ===

According to Buddhist scriptures, King Bimbisara met the Buddha for the first time prior to the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment, and later became an important disciple that featured prominently in certain Buddhist suttas. He is recorded to have attained sotapannahood, a degree of enlightenment in Buddhist teachings. Although Bimbisara let the women in his palace visit Buddha in his monastery in the evenings; the women wanted a hair-and-nail stupa they could use to venerate the Buddha any time. Bimbisara spoke with Buddha who complied with their request.

===Others===
According to Puranas, Bimbisara ruled Magadha for a period of 28 or 38 years. Sinhalese chronicles date his reign to be of 52 years. A fictionalised version of Bimbisara appears in the 2022 Indian film &quot;Bimbisara&quot;.

<doc id="812679" wikidata="Q3808012" url="?curid=812679" title="Jerry's Kids (band)">
<text>Jerry&#x27;s Kids is a Boston, Massachusetts, hardcore punk band, formed in 1981, from Braintree, Massachusetts, United States.

The band was named for &quot;the beneficiaries of the Jerry Lewis telethon&quot;. Their first recorded output was on the Modern Method &quot;This Is Boston, Not L.A.&quot; compilation LP in 1982. They contributed six tracks along with other early Boston hardcore band Gang Green.

Frontman Bryan Jones and rhythm guitar player Dave Aronson left the band early on. Bryan Jones had broken his leg at one of their gigs and his parents denied him permission to play in the band any further. Bassist Rick Jones (Bryan&#x27;s brother) switched to vocals and Chris Doherty of Gang Green took over on rhythm guitar. It was this line-up that recorded the classic 12 song LP &quot;Is This My World?&quot; on X-Claim in 1983, featuring songs such as &quot;Cracks In The Wall&quot;, &quot;Build Me A Bomb&quot; and &quot;Vietnam Syndrome&quot;.

&quot;Is This My World?&quot; was rewieved by Pushead in &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot;: &quot;An adventure into hyperactive, full-tilt, bulldozing quickness and thundering power. This overwhelming supply of burning rapid-fire speed destroys the mold, exploding into maniac doses of invincible strength and energy. Bolting drums, high-velocity crooning, and hysterically blistering wild guitars (featuring ex-GANG GREEN axeman Chris Doherty). JERRY’S KIDS totally shred the eardrums to mincemeat. For the fast fanatic’s cravings; the essence of what other will try to duplicate&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album &quot;a hardcore classic&quot;. In Europe, &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; gave the album 8/10.

They broke up in 1985, but reformed in 1987 with a more speed metal sound and released an LP on Taang! Records entitled &quot;Kill Kill Kill&quot;. Reflex/Wolfpack Records released a limited re-issue of the &quot;Is This My World?&quot; LP in 2002. The band reunited again in 2004 and has been playing several shows per year around Boston since then.

<text>Latorp is a village of Örebro Municipality in Sweden. It is located about 12 kilometers west of Örebro, and has a population of about 500. Recently the local inhabitants saved a local school by protesting against its permanent closure with the help of 130 liters of popcorn. Latorp was also the centre for a campaign in 2004 against the Tysslinge area becoming a city of its own. The village has a very active community council (Swedish: Byalag). Among the task of the community council is to arrange culture festivals. A minority of the inhabitants belong to the ELIM church. Latorps lies halfway between Örebro and the Ånnaboda skiing resort.

<text>Ajatasattu (Pāli: ) or Ajatashatru (Sanskrit: ) in the Buddhist tradition, or Kunika () and Kuniya () in the Jain tradition (reigned c. 492 to 460 BCE, or c. 405 to 373 BCE), was one of the most important kings of the Haryanka dynasty of Magadha in East India. He was the son of King Bimbisara and was a contemporary of both Mahavira and Gautama Buddha. He forcefully took over the kingdom of Magadha from his father and imprisoned him. He fought a war against the Vajjika League, led by the Licchavis, and conquered the republic of Vaishali. The city of Pataliputra was formed by fortification of a village by Ajatashatru.

Ajatashatru followed policies of conquest and expansion. He defeated his neighbouring rivals including the king of Kosala; his brothers, at odds with him, went to Kashi, which had been given to Bimbisara as dowry and led to a war between Magadha and Kosala.

Ajatashatru occupied Kashi and captured the smaller kingdoms. Magadha under Ajatashatru became the most powerful kingdom in North India.

==Datings==
Based on correlation with dates in the &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; and concluding that the Buddha died in 483 BC, Arthur Llewellyn Basham dated the accession of Ajatashatru to 491 BC. He estimates the first campaign of Ajatashatru to have taken place in 485 BC, and his second campaign against the Vajjika League in 481–480 BC. The &quot;Samaññaphala Sutta&quot; states that Ajatashatru visited the six teachers to hear their doctrines and at last visited the Buddha, an event Basham estimated to have taken place in 491 BC. Historian K. T. S. Sarao has estimated the dates of the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan as c. 477 to 397 BCE, and Ajatashatru&#x27;s reign as c. 405 to 373 BCE.

==Birth==

Ajatashatru, also known as &quot;Kunika&quot;, was the son of Bimbisara. The ancient inscription in Government Museum, Mathura refers to him as &quot;vaidehi putra Ajatashatru Kunika&quot; &quot;Ajatashatru Kunika, the son of Vaidehi.&quot; The story of Ajatashatru is found in the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; of Buddhism and Jain Agamas. The account of Ajatashatru&#x27;s birth is more or less similar in both the traditions. According to Jainism, Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Chellana; Buddhist tradition records Ajatashatru being born to Bimbisara and Kosala Devi. It is worthwhile to note that both the queens were called &quot;Vaidehi&quot; in both traditions.

According to the Jain &quot;Nirayavalika Sutra&quot;, during her pregnancy, Queen Chellana had a strong desire to eat the fried flesh of her husband&#x27;s heart and drink liquor. Meanwhile, the very intelligent Prince Abhayakumara, son of King Bimbisara and Queen Nanda, fried a wild fruit that resembled a heart and gave it to the queen. The queen ate it and later felt ashamed for having such a demonic desire and she feared that the child might grow up and prove fatal for the family, thus after a few months of the child being born, the queen had him thrown out of the palace. When the child was lying near the garbage dump, a cock bit his little finger. King Bimbisara, learning about the child being thrown out, ran outside and picked up the child and put its bleeding little finger in his mouth and sucked it until it stopped bleeding and continued this for days until it was healed. As the little finger of the child was sore, he was nicknamed &quot;Kunika&quot; &quot;Sore Finger&quot;. Later he was named &quot;Asokacanda&quot;.

In the Buddhist &quot;Atthakatha&quot;, the above story is almost the same, except that Kosaladevi desired to drink blood from Bimbisara&#x27;s arm; the king obliged her and, later, when the child was thrown near the garbage dump, due to an infection he got a boil on his little finger and the king sucked it and once while sucking it the boil burst inside the king&#x27;s mouth, but due to affection for his child he did not spit the pus out, rather swallowed it.

==War and victory over Vaishali==

The feud between Ajatashatru and Licchavi during 484–468 BCE led to defeat of the latter.
===The Jaina Tradition===
Once Queen Padmavati, wife of Ajatashatru, was sitting in her balcony in the evening. She saw Halla and Vihalla kumaras with their wives sitting on the elephant &quot;Sechanaka&quot; and one of the wives was wearing the 18-fold divine necklace. Then she heard one of the maidservants talking from the garden below. &quot;It&#x27;s Halla and Vihalla kumaras and not the king who enjoy the real pleasures of the kingdom&quot; and Padmavati thought &quot;What&#x27;s the use of the kingdom if I do not have both the jewels in my possession?&quot;

So, she shared this thought with Ajatashatru the same night and became excessively insistent in her demand. Ajatashatru, at last, agreed and sent a request to both his brothers to give the elephant and the necklace to him, which both his brothers denied saying that these gifts were given by their dear father so why should they part from them? Ajatashatru sent the request thrice but got the same reply all three times. This greatly annoyed him, so he sent his men to arrest them. Meanwhile, Halla and the Vihalla kumaras saw a chance and escaped to their maternal grandfather Chetaka who was the king of the great kingdom of the Vaishali republic (Vajjis/Licchavi tribe). Ajatashatru sent notice thrice to Chetaka to surrender them but was denied by Chetaka.

This was enough for Ajatashatru. He called his half brothers, Kalakumaras (10 kalakumaras, those born to King Bimbisara and 10 Kali Queens Kali, Sukali, Mahakali, etc.) to merge their army with his, since it was well known to Ajatashatru that Vaishali republic had always been invincible in the past and he alone would not be able to defeat it. Each Kalakumara brought 3000 horses, 3000 elephants, 3000 chariots and 30000 infantrymen each. On the other hand, Chetaka invited his own allies (9 Mallas, 9 Lichhvis and 18 kings of Kasi-Kosala) to fight his grandson Ajatashatru. All these kings came with 3000 horses, 3000 elephants, 3000 chariots and 30000 infantrymen each. Thus all together there were 57000 elephants, 57000 chariots, 57000 horses, and 570000 infantrymen.

The war began. King Chetaka was a devout follower of Mahavira and had a vow to not shoot more than one arrow per day in a war. It was known to all that Chetaka&#x27;s aim was perfect and his arrows were infallible. His first arrow killed one Kalakumara, commander of Ajatashatru. On the nine consecutive days, the rest of the nine Kalakumaras were killed by Chetaka. Deeply sorrowed by the death of their sons, the Kali queens were initiated as nuns in the holy order of Mahavira.

As Ajatashatru was moving towards defeat, he practised penance for three days and offered prayers to Sakrendra and Charmendra (Indra of different heavens), who then helped him in the war. They protected him from the infallible arrow of Chetaka. The war became very severe and, by the divine influence of the Indras, even the pebbles, straws, leaves hurled by Ajatashatru&#x27;s men were said to have fallen like rocks on the army of Chetaka. This weapon was thus named &quot;Mahasilakantaka&quot;, i.e. the weapon through which more than a lakh (100,000) people died. 
Next, the Indras granted a huge, automatically moving chariot with swinging spiked maces on each side, (and said to have been driven by Charmendra himself), to Ajatashatru. The chariot moved about in the battlefield crushing lakhs of soldiers. This war-chariot was named &quot;Ratha-Musala.&quot;

In this battle, Chetaka was defeated. But, Chetaka and others immediately took shelter inside the city walls of Vaishali and closed the main gate. The walls around Vaishali were so strong that Ajatashatru was unable to break through them. Many days passed, Ajatashatru became furious and again prayed to Indra, but this time Indra refused to help him. But Ajatashatru was informed by an oracle of a demi-goddess &quot;Vaishali can be conquered if &#x27;Sramana (monk) Kulvalaka&#x27; gets married to a courtesan.&quot;

Ajatashatru inquired about the monk Kulvalaka and sent for the prostitute &quot;Magadhika&quot; disguised as a devout follower. The fallen woman enticed the monk towards herself and finally, the monk gave up his monkhood and married her. Later Magadhika on Ajatashatru&#x27;s orders brainwashed Kulvalaka to enter Vaishali disguised as an astrologer. With great difficulty, he did enter Vaishali and learned that the city was saved by a &quot;Chaitya&quot; (altar) dedicated to &quot;Munisuvrata&quot;. Kulvalaka then started telling people that this altar is the reason why the city is suffering through misfortune. The people uprooted the altar from its very foundation. Kulvalaka gave a signal and Ajatashatru entered the city as per prior arrangement. This was the last attack. Vaishali was conquered by Ajatashatru.

Sechanaka the elephant died after it fell in a pit with iron rods and fire made by Ajatashatru&#x27;s soldiers. Later Halla and Vihalla kumaras were initiated as monks in the holy order of Mahavira. Chetaka practiced &quot;Sallekahna&quot; (fasting unto death). Ajatashatru not only conquered Vaishali but also Kasi-Kosala.

===The Buddhist traditions===
There was a diamond mine near a village on the river Ganges. There was an agreement between Ajatashatru and the Licchavi of Vajji that they would have an equal share of the diamonds. However, because of sheer lethargy, Ajatashatru failed to collect his own share, and most of diamonds were carried away by the Lichhavis. Over time, finally, Ajatashatru became annoyed and decided to do something about it. Since he thought that it might be almost impossible to fight against the whole confederacy of Vaishali, he decided instead to uproot the powerful Vajjis and exterminate them. He sent his chief minister Vassakara to the Buddha to ask him why the Vaishali should be so invincible; to which Buddha gave seven reasons, including: That the Vajjis are always punctual to meetings, their disciplined behavior, their respect for elders, respect for women, that they do not marry their daughters forcefully, that they give spiritual protection to the Arhats, and finally, the main reason was the Chaityas (altar), which was inside the town.

Thus, with the help of his chief minister Vassakara, Ajatashatru managed to split the Vajjis and also broke the chaityas inside. During this battle, Ajatashatru used a scythed chariot, featuring a swinging mace and blades on both sides and attacked the town with it and conquered it.

==Kingdom==

Ajatashatru moved his capital from Rajgriha to Champa due to death of his father.

==Family==
===The Jaina tradition===
According to the &quot;Nirayāvaliyā Suttā&quot; Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Chellana, who was the daughter of &quot;Chetaka&quot; the king of Vaishali, who was the brother of &quot;Queen Triśalá&quot;, mother of Mahavira. Ajatashatru had eight wives.

===The Buddhist tradition===

According to &quot;Dīgha nikāya,&quot; Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Kosala Devi, who was the daughter of &quot;Maha-Kosala&quot;, (the king of Kosala) and sister of &quot;Pasenadi&quot; who later succeeded to the throne. Ajatashatru had 500 wives but the principal consort was Princess Vajira. The City of Kasi was given to Bimbisara as dowry by Maha-Kosala. After the murder of Bimbisara, Prasenajit took the city back. This resulted in a war between Ajatashatru and Prasenajit. The war ended in a peace treaty in which Prasenajit married his daughter Vajira to him. Ajatashatru later had a son named &quot;Udayabhadda or Udayabhadra&quot;.

==Death==
The account of Ajatashatru&#x27;s death recorded by historians is . The account of his death differs widely between Jain and Buddhist traditions. Other accounts point towards as the year of his death.

==Religion==

Ajatashatru is mentioned in both Jaina and Buddhist traditions.

The &quot;Uvavai/Aupapātika sutta,&quot; which is the first &quot;Upānga&quot; (see Jain Agamas) of the Jains throws light on the relation between Mahavira and Ajatashatru. It accounts that Ajatashatru held Mahavira in the highest esteem. The same text also states that Ajatashatru had an officer to report to him about the daily routine of Mahavira. He was paid lavishly. The officer had a vast network and supporting field staff through whom he collected all the information about Mahavira and reported to the king. The &quot;Uvavai Sutta&quot; has detailed and illuminating discussion on Mahavira&#x27;s arrival at the city of Champa, the honor was shown to him by Ajatashatru, the sermon given by Mahavira in Ardhamagadhi language, etc.

According to Buddhist tradition, the &quot;Samaññaphala Sutta&quot; deals with his first meeting with the Buddha, where he realized his mistakes with his association to Devadatta and planining to killing his own father. According to the same text, during this meeting, Ajatashatru took protection of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. He was mentioned more than once in several other Sutta as an example of strong devotee to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. He erected a vast &quot;Stupa&quot; on the bones and ashes of the Buddha after the funeral, and Ajatashatru also was present in the first Buddhist council at the Sattapanni (Saptparni) caves Rajgriha.

In Mahayana Buddhism, Ajatashatru plays a significant soteriological role. He appears in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra as a being completely overtaken by evil and suffering, and as such the prototype of an ordinary, sinful person who can only be saved by the Buddha&#x27;s compassion; the Buddha even declares in this sutra that he will &quot;remain in the world for the sake of Ajatashatru&quot;. This episode, along with the broader theme of the Age of Dharma Decline, informed several Mahayana schools&#x27; emphasis on faith rather than accumulating merit.

Whether Ajatashatru was a Jain or Buddhist, both texts accounted for him as a devotee of the respective religions.

==Depictions in popular culture==
* A fictionalised account of Ajatashatru – depicted as a physically gross and tyrannical figure, who delights in committing atrocities and massacres – appears in Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Creation&quot;.
* He features as the protagonist in the film &quot;Amrapali&quot; (1966), where he is played by Sunil Dutt with Vyjayanthimala in the titular role of Amrapali.
* A book about his life was written titled Ajatashatru, by Subba Rao.

<text>The Army Staff Identification Badge is an identification badge awarded by the Chief of Staff of the Army to officers, warrant officers, and enlisted soldiers assigned to authorized positions at Headquarters, Department of the Army.

==History==
General Douglas MacArthur first proposed an Army General Staff Badge in 1931, but it was not until 1933 that the War Department authorized it. The badge has remained unchanged in appearance since it was first created, but the name was changed in 1982 from the &quot;Army General Staff Identification Badge&quot; to the &quot;Army Staff Identification Badge&quot;, and the eligibility criteria have evolved.

On a United States Army uniform, the Army Staff Identification Badge is worn centered on the right breast pocket; however, per ALARACT 203/2010 wear of the Army Staff Identification Badge is authorized on the left breast pocket when worn in conjunction with a deployment CSIB (Combat Service Identification Badge) 

A similar Army Staff Lapel Pin is authorized for civilian employees of the Department of the Army, regardless of grade, who fill an eligible position in an HQDA agency for no less than one year.

<text>The South Slavic languages are one of three branches of the Slavic languages. There are approximately 30 million speakers, mainly in the Balkans. These are separated geographically from speakers of the other two Slavic branches (West and East) by a belt of German, Hungarian and Romanian speakers.

== History ==

The first South Slavic language to be written (also the first attested Slavic language) was the variety of the Eastern South Slavic spoken in Thessaloniki, now called Old Church Slavonic, in the ninth century. It is retained as a liturgical language in Slavic Orthodox churches in the form of various local Church Slavonic traditions.

== Classification ==

The South Slavic languages constitute a dialect continuum. Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin constitute a single dialect within this continuum.
*South Slavic
** Eastern South Slavic
*** Bulgarian – (ISO 639-1 code: bg; ISO 639-2 code: bul; SIL code: bul; Linguasphere: 53-AAA-hb)
*** Macedonian – (ISO 639-1 code: mk; ISO 639-2(B) code: mac; ISO 639-2(T) code: mkd; SIL code: mkd; Linguasphere: 53-AAA-ha)
*** Old Church Slavonic (extinct) – (ISO 639-1 code: cu; ISO 639-2 code: chu; SIL code: chu; Linguasphere: 53-AAA-a)
** Transitional South Slavic
*** Torlakian
*** Slovene (ISO 639-1 code: sl; ISO 639-2 code: slv; ISO 639-3 code: slv; Linguasphere: 53-AAA-f)
*** Kajkavian (ISO 639-3 code: kjv)
*** Chakavian (ISO 639-3 code: ckm) 

***Serbo-Croatian/Shtokavian (ISO 639-1 code: sh; ISO 639-2/3 code: hbs; SIL code: scr; Linguasphere: 53-AAA-g).&lt;br&gt;There are four national standard languages based on the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect:
**** Serbian (ISO 639-1 code: sr; ISO 639-2/3 code: srp; SIL code: srp)
**** Croatian (ISO 639-1 code: hr; ISO 639-2/3 code: hrv; SIL code: hrv)
**** Bosnian (ISO 639-1 code: bs; ISO 639-2/3 code: bos; SIL code: bos)
**** Montenegrin (ISO 639-2/3 code: cnr; SIL code: cnr)
=== Linguistic prehistory ===
The Slavic languages are part of the Balto-Slavic group, which belongs to the Indo-European language family. The South Slavic languages have been considered a genetic node in Slavic studies: defined by a set of phonological, morphological and lexical innovations (isoglosses) which separate it from the Western and Eastern Slavic groups. That view, however, has been challenged in recent decades (see below).

Some innovations encompassing all South Slavic languages are shared with the Eastern Slavic group, but not the Western Slavic. These include:
# Consistent application of Slavic second palatalization before Proto-Slavic *v
# Loss of *d and *t before Proto-Slavic *l
# Merger of Proto-Slavic *ś (resulting from the second and third palatalization) with *s

This is illustrated in the following table:
Several isoglosses have been identified which are thought to represent exclusive common innovations in the South Slavic language group. They are prevalently phonological in character, whereas morphological and syntactical isoglosses are much fewer in number. list the following phonological isoglosses:

# Merger of yers into schwa-like sound, which became in Serbo-Croatian, or split according to the retained hard/soft quality of the preceding consonant into (Macedonian), or (Bulgarian)
# Proto-Slavic *ę &gt; 
# Proto-Slavic *y &gt; , merging with the reflex of Proto-Slavic *i
# Proto-Slavic syllabic liquids *r̥ and *l̥ were retained, but *l̥ was subsequently lost in all the daughter languages with different outputs (&gt; in Serbo-Croatian, &gt; vowel+ or +vowel in Slovene, Bulgarian and Macedonian), and *r̥ became in Bulgarian. This development was identical to the loss of &quot;yer&quot; after a liquid consonant.
# Hardening of palatals and dental affricates; e.g. š&#x27; &gt; š, č&#x27; &gt; č, c&#x27; &gt; c.
# South Slavic form of liquid metathesis (CoRC &gt; CRaC, CoLC &gt; CLaC etc.)

Most of these are not exclusive in character, however, and are shared with some languages of the Eastern and Western Slavic language groups (in particular, Central Slovakian dialects). On that basis, argues that South Slavic exists strictly as a geographical grouping, not forming a true genetic clade; in other words, there was never a proto-South Slavic language or a period in which all South Slavic dialects exhibited an exclusive set of extensive phonological, morphological or lexical changes (isoglosses) peculiar to them. Furthermore, Matasović argues, there was never a period of cultural or political unity in which Proto-South-Slavic could have existed during which Common South Slavic innovations could have occurred. Several South-Slavic-only lexical and morphological patterns which have been proposed have been postulated to represent common Slavic archaisms, or are shared with some Slovakian or Ukrainian dialects.

The South Slavic dialects form a dialectal continuum stretching from today&#x27;s southern Austria to southeast Bulgaria. On the level of dialectology, they are divided into Western South Slavic (Slovene and Serbo-Croatian dialects) and Eastern South Slavic (Bulgarian and Macedonian dialects); these represent separate migrations into the Balkans and were once separated by intervening Hungarian, Romanian, and Albanian populations; as these populations were assimilated, Eastern and Western South Slavic fused with Torlakian as a transitional dialect. On the other hand, the breakup of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, followed by formation of nation-states in the 19th and 20th centuries, led to the development and codification of standard languages. Standard Slovene, Bulgarian, and Macedonian are based on distinct dialects. The Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian standard variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian are based on the same dialect (Shtokavian). Thus, in most cases national and ethnic borders do not coincide with dialectal boundaries.

Note: Due to the differing political status of languages/dialects and different historical contexts, the classifications are arbitrary to some degree.

== Eastern South Slavic languages ==

The dialects that form the eastern group of South Slavic, spoken mostly in Bulgaria and Macedonia and adjacent areas in neighbouring countries (such as the Bessarabian Bulgarians in Ukraine), share a number of characteristics that set them apart from other Slavic languages:
* the existence of a definite article (e.g. &quot;книга&quot;, book – &quot;книгата, the book, &quot;време&quot;, time – &quot;времето, the time)
* a near-complete lack of noun cases
* the lack of a verb infinitive
* the formation of comparative forms of adjectives formed with the prefix &quot;по-&quot; (e.g. &quot;добър, по-добър&quot; (Bulg.)/&quot;добар, подобар&quot; (Maced.) – good, better) 
* a future tense formed by the present form of the verb preceded by &quot;ще/ќе&quot;
* the existence of a renarrative mood (e.g. &quot;Той ме видял.&quot; (Bulg.)/&quot;Тој ме видел.&quot; (Maced.) – He supposedly saw me. Compare with &quot;Той ме видя.&quot;/&quot;Тој ме виде.&quot; – He saw me.)
Bulgarian and Macedonian share some of their unusual characteristics with other languages in the Balkans, notably Greek and Albanian (see Balkan sprachbund).

=== Bulgarian dialects ===
*Eastern Bulgarian dialects
*Western Bulgarian dialects (includes Torlakian dialects)

=== Macedonian dialects ===
* Southeastern Macedonian dialects
* Northern Macedonian (including three Torlakian dialects)
* Western Macedonian dialects

=== Torlakian dialect in Serbian ===
* Torlakian dialects in southeast Serbia are only spoken and unstandardized, as Serbian literary language only recognizes the Shtokavian form (as other Serbo-Croatian languages)

== Transitional South Slavic languages ==

=== Torlakian dialects ===
Torlakian dialects are spoken in southeastern Serbia, northern North Macedonia, western Bulgaria, southeastern Kosovo, and pockets of western Romania; it is considered transitional between the Western and Eastern groups of South Slavic languages. Torlakian is thought to fit together with Bulgarian and Macedonian into the Balkan sprachbund, an area of linguistic convergence caused by long-term contact rather than genetic relation. Because of this some researchers tend to classify it as Southeast Slavic.

== Western South Slavic languages==

=== History ===
Each of these primary and secondary dialectal units breaks down into subdialects and accentological isoglosses by region. In the past (and currently, in isolated areas), it was not uncommon for individual villages to have their own words and phrases. However, during the 20th century the local dialects have been influenced by Štokavian standards through mass media and public education and much &quot;local speech&quot; has been lost (primarily in areas with larger populations). With the breakup of Yugoslavia, a rise in national awareness has caused individuals to modify their speech according to newly established standard-language guidelines. The wars have caused large migrations, changing the ethnic (and dialectal) picture of some areas—especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in central Croatia and Serbia (Vojvodina in particular). In some areas, it is unclear whether location or ethnicity is the dominant factor in the dialect of the speaker. Because of this the speech patterns of some communities and regions are in a state of flux, and it is difficult to determine which dialects will die out entirely. Further research over the next few decades will be necessary to determine the changes made in the dialectical distribution of this language group.

=== Shtokavian dialects ===
The eastern Herzegovinian dialect is the basis of the Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian standard variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian.

=== Chakavian dialects ===
Chakavian is spoken in the western, central, and southern parts of Croatia—mainly in Istria, the Kvarner Gulf, Dalmatia and inland Croatia (Gacka and Pokupje, for example). The Chakavian reflex of proto-Slavic &quot;yat&quot; is &quot;i&quot; or sometimes &quot;e&quot; (rarely as &quot;(i)je&quot;), or mixed (&quot;Ekavian–Ikavian&quot;). Many dialects of Chakavian preserved significant number of Dalmatian words, but also have many loanwords from Venetian, Italian, Greek and other Mediterranean languages.

Example: &quot;Ča je, je, tako je vavik bilo, ča će bit, će bit, a nekako će već bit!&quot;

==== Burgenland Croatian ====

This dialect is spoken primarily in the federal state of Burgenland in Austria and nearby areas in Vienna, Slovakia, and Hungary by descendants of Croats who migrated there during the 16th century. This dialect (or family of dialects) differs from standard Croatian, since it has been heavily influenced by German and Hungarian. It has properties of all three major dialectal groups in Croatia, since the migrants did not all come from the same area, but the linguistic standard is based on the Chakavian dialect.

=== Kajkavian dialects ===
Kajkavian is mostly spoken in northern and northwest Croatia near the Hungarian and Slovene borders—chiefly around the towns of Zagreb, Varaždin, Čakovec, Koprivnica, Petrinja, Delnice and so on. Its reflex of &quot;yat&quot; is primarily , rarely diphthongal &quot;ije&quot;). This differs from that of the Ekavian accent; many Kajkavian dialects distinguish a closed &quot;e&quot;—nearly &quot;ae&quot; (from &quot;yat&quot;)—and an open &quot;e&quot; (from the original &quot;e&quot;). It lacks several palatals &quot;(ć, lj, nj, dž)&quot; found in the Shtokavian dialect, and has some loanwords from the nearby Slovene dialects and German (chiefly in towns).

Example: &quot;Kak je, tak je; tak je navek bilo, kak bu tak bu, a bu vre nekak kak bu!&quot;

=== Slovene dialects ===

Slovene is mainly spoken in Slovenia. Spoken Slovene has numerous dialects, but there is no consensus on how many; estimates range from 7 to 50. The lowest estimate refers to the language&#x27;s seven commonly recognized dialect groups, without subdividing any of them. Some of the seven groups are more heterogeneous than others, and the higher estimates reflect the varying criteria that have been used to differentiate dialects and subdialects. Slovenian dialects can be so different from each other that a speaker of one dialect may have a very difficult time understanding a speaker of another, particularly if their dialects belong to different groups. Some dialects spoken in southern Slovenia transition into Chakavian or Kajkavian Serbo-Croatian, while the transition from eastern dialects to Kajkavian is general, with cases of essentially the same linguistic variety spoken on both sides of the border (this is particularly true for the upper course of the Kupa and Sutla rivers).

=== Comparison ===
The table below compares grammatical and phonological innovations. The similarity of Kajkavian and Slovene is apparent.


== Grammar ==

=== Eastern–Western division ===

In broad terms, the Eastern dialects of South Slavic (Bulgarian and Macedonian) differ most from the Western dialects in the following ways:

* The Eastern dialects have almost completely lost their noun declensions, and have become entirely analytic.
* The Eastern dialects have developed definite-article suffixes similar to the other languages in the Balkan sprachbund.
* The Eastern dialects have lost the infinitive; thus, the first-person singular (for Bulgarian) or the third-person singular (for Macedonian) are considered the main part of a verb. Sentences which would require an infinitive in other languages are constructed through a clause in Bulgarian, &quot;искам да ходя (iskam da hodya)&quot;, &quot;I want to go&quot; (literally, &quot;I want that I go&quot;).

Apart from these three main areas there are several smaller, significant differences:

* The Western dialects have three genders in both singular and plural (Slovene has dual—see below), while the Eastern dialects only have them in the singular—for example, Serbian &quot;on&quot; (he), &quot;ona&quot; (she), &quot;ono&quot; (it), &quot;oni&quot; (they, masc), &quot;one&quot; (they, fem), &quot;ona&quot; (they, neut); the Bulgarian &quot;te&quot; (they) and Macedonian тие (&quot;tie&quot;, &#x27;they&#x27;) covers the entire plural.
* Inheriting a generalization of another demonstrative as a base form for the third-person pronoun which already occurred in late Proto-Slavic, standard literary Bulgarian (like Old Church Slavonic) does not use the Slavic &quot;on-/ov-&quot; as base forms like &quot;on, ona, ono, oni&quot; (he, she, it, they), and &quot;ovaj, ovde&quot; (this, here), but uses &quot;to-/t-&quot;based pronouns like &quot;toy, tya, to, te&quot;, and &quot;tozi, tuk&quot; (it only retains &quot;onzi&quot; – &quot;that&quot; and its derivatives). Western Bulgarian dialects and Macedonian have &quot;ov-/on-&quot; pronouns, and sometimes use them interchangeably.
* All dialects of Serbo-Croatian contain the concept of &quot;any&quot; – e.g. Serbian &quot;neko&quot; &quot;someone&quot;; &quot;niko&quot; &quot;no one&quot;; &quot;iko&quot; &quot;anyone&quot;. All others lack the last, and make do with &quot;some-&quot; or &quot;no-&quot; constructions instead.

=== Divisions within Western dialects ===

* While Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian Shtokavian dialects have basically the same grammar, its usage is very diverse. While all three languages are relatively highly inflected, the further east one goes the more likely it is that analytic forms are used – if not spoken, at least in the written language. A very basic example is:
** Croatian – &quot;hoću ići&quot; – &quot;I want – to go&quot;
** Serbian – &quot;hoću da idem&quot; – &quot;I want – that – I go&quot;
* Slovene has retained the proto-Slavic dual number (which means that it has &quot;nine&quot; personal pronouns in the third person) for both nouns and verbs. For example:
** nouns: &quot;volk&quot; (wolf) → &quot;volkova&quot; (two wolves) → &quot;volkovi&quot; (some wolves)
** verbs: &quot;hodim&quot; (I walk) → &quot;hodiva&quot; (the two of us walk) → &quot;hodimo&quot; (we walk)

=== Divisions within Eastern dialects ===

* In Macedonian, the perfect is largely based on the verb &quot;to have&quot; (as in other Balkan languages like Greek and Albanian, and in English), as opposed to the verb &quot;to be&quot;, which is used as the auxiliary in all other Slavic languages (see also Macedonian verbs):
** Macedonian – &quot;imam videno&quot; – I have seen (&quot;imam&quot; – &quot;to have&quot;)
** Bulgarian – &quot;vidyal sum&quot; – I have seen (&quot;sum&quot; – &quot;to be&quot;)
*In Macedonian there are three types of definite article (base definite form, definite noun near the speaker and definite noun far from the speaker).
**дете (&quot;dete&quot;, &#x27;а child&#x27;)
**детето (&quot;deteto&quot;, &#x27;the child&#x27;)
**детево (&quot;detevo&quot;, &#x27;this child [near me]&#x27;)
**детено (&quot;deteno&quot;, &#x27;that child [over there]&#x27;)

== Writing systems ==

Languages to the west of Serbia use the Latin script, whereas those to the east and south use Cyrillic. Serbian officially uses the Cyrillic script, though commonly Latin and Cyrillic are used equally. Most newspapers are written in Cyrillic and most magazines are in Latin; books written by Serbian authors are written in Cyrillic, whereas books translated from foreign authors are usually in Latin, other than languages that already use Cyrillic, most notably Russian. On television, writing as part of a television programme is usually in Cyrillic, but advertisements are usually in Latin. The division is partly based on religion – Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Macedonia (which use Cyrillic) are Orthodox countries, whereas Croatia and Slovenia (which use Latin) are Catholic. The Bosnian language, used by the Muslim Bosniaks, also uses Latin, but in the past used Bosnian Cyrillic. The Glagolitic alphabet was also used in the Middle Ages (most notably in Bulgaria, Macedonia and Croatia), but gradually disappeared.

<text>Building design, also called architectural design, refers to the broadly based architectural, engineering and technical applications to the design of buildings. All building projects require the services of a building designer, typically a licensed architect. Smaller, less complicated projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, interior designers (for interior fit-outs or renovations), or contractors. Larger, more complex building projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.

== Occupations ==

===Architect===

An architect is a person trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of buildings. Professionally, an architect&#x27;s decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. In most of the world&#x27;s jurisdictions, the professional and commercial use of the term &quot;architect&quot; is legally protected.

===Building engineer===

Building engineering typically includes the services of electrical, mechanical and structural engineers.

===Draftsperson===
A draftsperson or documenter has attained a certificate or diploma in architectural drafting (or equivalent training), and provides services relating to preparing construction documents rather than building design. Some draftspersons are employed by architectural design firms and building contractors, while others are self-employed.

===Building designer===
In many places, building codes and legislation of professions allow persons to design single family residential buildings and, in some cases, light commercial buildings without an architectural license. As such, &quot;Building designer&quot; is a common designation in the United States, Canada, Australia and elsewhere for someone who offers building design services but is not a licensed architect or engineer.

Anyone may use the title of &quot;building designer&quot; in the broadest sense. In many places, a building designer may achieve certification demonstrating a higher level of training. In the U.S., the &quot;National Council of Building Designer Certification&quot; (NCBDC), an offshoot of the &quot;American Institute of Building Design&quot;, administers a program leading to the title of &quot;Certified Professional Building Designer&quot; (CPBD). Usually, building designers are trained as architectural technologists or draftspersons; they may also be architecture school graduates that have not completed licensing requirements.

Many building designers are known as &quot;residential&quot; or &quot;home designers&quot;, since they focus mainly on residential design and remodeling. In the U.S. state of Nevada, &quot;Residential Designer&quot; is a regulated term for those who are registered as such under Nevada State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design, and one may not legally represent oneself in a professional capacity without being currently registered.

In Australia where use of the term architect and some derivatives is highly restricted but the architectural design of buildings has very few restrictions in place, the term building designer is used extensively by people or design practices who are not registered by the relevant State Board of Architects. In Queensland the term building design is used in legislation which licenses practitioners as part of a broader building industry licensing system. In Victoria there is a registration process for building designers and in other States there is currently no regulation of the profession. A Building Designers Association operates in each state to represent the interests of building designers.

===Building surveyor===
Building surveyors are technically minded general practitioners in the United Kingdom, Australia and elsewhere, trained much like architectural technologists. In the UK, the knowledge and expertise of the building surveyor is applied to various tasks in the property and construction markets, including building design for smaller residential and light commercial projects. This aspect of the practice is similar to other European occupations, most notably the &quot;geometra&quot; in Italy, but also the &quot;géomètre&quot; in France, Belgium and Switzerland.
the building surveyors are also capable on establishment of bills of quantities for the new works and renovation or maintenance or rehabilitation works.

The profession of Building Surveyor does not exist in the US. The title &quot;Surveyor&quot; refers almost exclusively to Land surveyors. Architects, Building Designers, Residential Designers, Construction Managers, and Home Inspectors perform some or all of the work of the U.K. Building Surveyor.

<doc id="812753" wikidata="Q930165" url="?curid=812753" title="The Young and the Hopeless">
<text>The Young and the Hopeless is the second studio album by American rock band Good Charlotte, released on October 1, 2002, by Epic and Daylight Records. Following the release of their self-titled debut album (2000), the band met producer Eric Valentine and engaged him for their next album. Sessions took place at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California and lasted from February to May 2002; Josh Freese of the Vandals served as a session drummer. Almost all of the songs on it were written by brothers Benji and Joel Madden; two of the tracks were co-written with Valentine and Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann. Before the album was released, Chris Wilson joined them as a permanent drummer, having been introduced to them in mid-2002. &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; is a pop punk album that recalls the work of Blink-182, Green Day, and MxPx.

&quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; served as the lead single to &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot;, released in August 2002. The album was promoted with a support slot for No Doubt before the group embarked on their own headlining tour of the United States, with subsequent shows in Japan, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in the following months. &quot;The Anthem&quot; was released as the second single in February 2003 prior to the band co-headlining the Honda Civic Tour with New Found Glory between April and June 2003. A month after that trek concluded, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; was released as the third single. From September to November 2003, the band embarked on a headlining US arena tour; coinciding with this, &quot;Hold On&quot; was first released to alternative rock radio in September 2003, and later released as a joint single with &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot; in January 2004.

&quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who made comments about the songs&#x27; clichéd lyrics. Despite the mixed critical reception, the album was a major commercial success, being certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three of the album&#x27;s singles—&quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot;, &quot;The Anthem&quot;, and &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;—crossed over from modern rock radio to pop radio. Outside the US, the album charted within the top 20 in New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, the UK, and Austria, and reached lower positions in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), as well as two times platinum by Music Canada (MC). The album and &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; were nominated for several awards, with the latter winning the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Award for Best Single. The album appeared on best-of lists by &quot;Rock Sound&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and earned the Classic Album Award at the Alternative Press Music Awards.

==Background and recording==
After leaving their home state of Maryland, Good Charlotte were signed to Epic imprint Daylight Records and released their debut album, &quot;Good Charlotte&quot;, in September 2000. It did not sell as well as the label hoped, and the group were nearly dropped. By the end of 2000, vocalist Joel Madden said they had a lot of new material ready for their next album, and had been performing &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; by April 2001. The minor success of &quot;Little Things&quot;, coupled with appearing at Warped Tour and touring alongside Blink-182 in 2001 helped increase their popularity. Sometime afterwards, drummer Aaron Escolopio left the group to join his brother&#x27;s band Wakefield. He was replaced by Nate Foutz of Vroom, who stayed with the group for six weeks. Dusty Bill was then engaged to play drums; he remained with the group for a year. While promoting the self-titled album, the group met Eric Valentine at a show, and decided to work with him on their next record.

Valentine, who acted as producer, said he was interested in the band because of their writing, which he felt was &quot;a little deeper&quot; than that of their contemporaries. Madden said they &quot;wanted a hit record, to do something big and important ... and that’s where [Valentine] came in&quot;. Recording of &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; took place at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California, between February 1 and May 1, 2002. Valentine often mediated between the band members, who would bicker during pre-production. Josh Freese of The Vandals was brought in as a session member; Joel Madden knew Freese from touring and asked him to drum on the album.

Valentine and Ken Allardyce acted as engineers, while Jason Slater, Dave Cooley and Wes Seidman did additional editing. David Campbell conducted strings, which were arranged by Valentine and Eric Campbell and engineered by Nate Kunkel. Valentine mixed the recordings and Brian Gardner mastered them at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Los Angeles. Benji Madden said, &quot;Nothing about that record was pre-meditated, we were just having fun, and trying to do the best we could to achieve that goal&quot;. In 2016, Benji Madden said of the album: &quot;We’d gone out into the world and felt both the positive and the negative. And on &quot;The Young And The Hopeless&quot; we decided to really take a direction and stand up for ourselves, in a way.&quot;

==Composition==
Discussing the album name, Joel Madden said; &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; &quot;felt like the generation we were in ... I think it was the way a generation felt in the early 2000s. Everything started to change over.&quot; All of the songs on the album were written by the Madden brothers, except for &quot;A New Beginning&quot; and &quot;The Anthem&quot;. The former was written by Benji Madden and Valentine, and the latter was written by the Madden brothers and Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann. All of the songs were arranged by the band, except &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, which was arranged by Benji Madden and Valentine. Musically, the album has been described as pop punk, and compared with the work of Blink-182, Green Day, and MxPx.

With the opening track &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, the group wanted to make something different. According to Joel Madden, they adored the work of Danny Elfman and wanted to emulate his style, specifically in the vein of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993). &quot;The Anthem&quot; was written after producers of an unspecified movie asked for a song to include on the soundtrack. According to Benji Madden, the producers wanted a song similar to &quot;Little Things&quot;, asking; &quot;Can you write another loser anthem?&quot; The brothers wrote it with Feldmann because they loved Goldfinger and wanted to work with him before they worked with Valentine and Don Gilmore. The movie producers used &quot;Little Things&quot; instead; as a result, &quot;The Anthem&quot; features the lyric &quot;Another loser anthem&quot;. The latter&#x27;s bridge was written as a joke and was intended to be replaced later but was left on the album. &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; features the drum motif of &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1977) by Iggy Pop, and is social commentary about the freedom celebrities have. While &quot;The Story of My Old Man&quot; is predominantly about the Madden brothers&#x27; father, it references Benji Madden&#x27;s experience with alcohol. They briefly considered not releasing the track, which they found embarrassing, but they included it on the album because they felt their fans might relate to it.

&quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; was written after an evening during which the Madden brothers tried to enter a club but were twice turned away. They were allowed into a third club; according to Benji Madden, they were &quot;just kids without a lot of experience, just kind of observing what was going on&quot;. He discovered the &quot;dynamic of certain types of people with different agendas ... to be amusing&quot;. They wrote the song the following day. &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot; is about a man who kills the boyfriend of the woman he has a crush for. &quot;Hold On&quot; is an anti-suicide song that talks about coping with life; Joel Madden wrote it after receiving letters from fans, who said the band helped them through difficult periods of their lives. &quot;Riot Girl&quot; evokes the work of Rancid. &quot;Say Anything&quot; is a string-laden ballad that originated in 1999 under the name &quot;Time After Time&quot;, when it had a different set of lyrics. &quot;The Day That I Die&quot; discusses a person&#x27;s final days, while &quot;Emotionless&quot; was written about the realization the Madden brothers would not talk to their father again. Madden said of the latter; &quot;We have to come to our own kind of closure. It’s kind of a song we wrote for ourselves&quot;.

==Release==
During Good Charlotte&#x27;s appearance on 2002 Warped Tour, Autopilot Off&#x27;s Phil Robinson was filling in as Good Charlotte&#x27;s temporary drummer; the Used, who were aware Good Charlotte needed a drummer, introduced them to Chris Wilson. Shortly after this, Wilson became the group&#x27;s drummer. In July 2002, the group filmed a video for &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot;; it was directed by Bill Fishman and features appearances from &#x27;NSYNC vocalist Chris Kirkpatrick, Tenacious D guitarist Kyle Gass, and Minutemen bassist Mike Watt. In the video, the group perform inside a mansion, before police surround the building. The band are arrested and appear in a courtroom. The song was released to modern rock radio on August 12 that year and was released as a CD single on September 9. It includes the tracks &quot;Cemetery&quot;, &quot;The Click&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; as B-sides.

&quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; was released on October 1, 2002, through Epic and Daylight Records. The music video for &quot;The Anthem&quot; premiered on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on January 15, 2003; it was directed by duo Smith N&#x27; Borin and was filmed in Huntington Beach, California, in December 2002 over a 16-hour period. The clip depicts the group riding down a street on lowrider bikes with cameras fixed to the bikes&#x27; handlebars and shows the band members partying with their friends. Members of New Found Glory, Mest, and Home Grown appear during the video.

On January 13, 2003, &quot;The Anthem&quot; was released as a single. The CD single includes acoustic versions of &quot;Riot Girl&quot;, &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot;, and &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; as B-sides. &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; was released in the UK in February. The group filmed a video for &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; with Smith N&#x27; Borin during a two-day break in New Zealand later that year. The video treatment was a concept the directors had for a while but could not find an artist with whom it would fit until they worked with Good Charlotte. The video includes short vignettes that display the personalities of each band member; Benji Madden acts as a playboy and oils a woman; guitarist Billy Martin plays video games; Wilson throws drinks; bassist Paul Thomas relaxes with two women who feed him pretzels; and Joel Madden does hip-hop dancing. The ending of the video shows an elderly woman offering Benji Madden a bowl of cereal; this was influenced by the film &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996).

On April 28, 2003, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; was released as a single in Europe. The CD version also included &quot;If You Leave&quot;, a live version of &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot;, and &quot;Complicated&quot; as B-sides. To promote the group&#x27;s September–November arena tour, &quot;Hold On&quot; was released to alternative rock radio on October 13, 2003. In October, the group filmed a music video for the track with director Samuel Bayer. It premiered on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; the following month. For the music video, the group collaborated with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention; it features people with their dead relatives and people who have attempted suicide. Later, on January 13, 2004, the latter track and &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot; were released as a joint single. The music video for &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot; was directed by Sam Erickson and the Madden brothers. The video was filmed on a sound stage in Indianapolis, Indiana. The set was filled with trophies and ribbons, which the band destroy towards the end of the video. In September 2003, the album was reissued as a two-CD package with &quot;Good Charlotte&quot;.

&quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; was pressed on vinyl in 2014 and 2016 by Enjoy the Ride Records. Four tracks from it—&quot;The Anthem&quot; (by Million $ Mano and featured Hollywood Holt), &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; (by Ed Banger Allstars), &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot; (by Mr. Hahn) and &quot;Hold On&quot; (by the Academy Is...)—were remixed for inclusion on Good Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Remixes&quot; (2008) compilation. &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot;, &quot;The Anthem&quot;, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, &quot;The Young &amp; the Hopeless&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2010) compilation.

==Touring and TV appearances==
Between late June and mid-August 2002, Good Charlotte appeared on that year&#x27;s Warped Tour. The Madden brothers embarked on an Australian promotional tour, which included appearances on &quot;The Panel&quot; and &quot;whatUwant&quot;, in addition to a performance for Triple M. The band appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in early October, before supporting No Doubt on their arena tour for a few shows; Good Charlotte unsuccessfully tried to appear on the whole trek, but were eventually replaced by Garbage. In October and November, Good Charlotte embarked on a headlining US tour, and appeared at three shows of the Boom Boom Huck Jam tour. Later in November, the band appeared on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. They then went on a short UK tour, which ended with a supporting slot for Our Lady Peace. Upon returning to the US, they played a variety of radio festivals, and concluded the year with a performance at MTV&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcast in New York City. They started 2003 with Japanese and European tours, with New Found Glory in January and February 2003. On February 24, 2003, Good Charlotte appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and soon afterwards, went to Australia and New Zealand.

After a performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, they co-headlined the three-month long Honda Civic Tour with New Found Glory between April and June 2003. The first half the trek was supported by Less Than Jake and Roger Miret and the Disasters, with MxPx supporting the second half. In mid-June 2003, the Madden brothers sung at KROQ Weenie Roast acoustically because Good Charlotte&#x27;s guitarist Martin had to attend a wedding. In August, the group performed at the MTV Video Music Awards. When playing at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, the audience&#x27;s reaction was very negative and some of them bottled the band. Between September and November, the group embarked on a headlining US arena trek, the first half of which was supported by Mest and Something Corporate, while the remaining half was supported by Eve 6 and Goldfinger. The Living End were also due to support, but had to cancel, citing issues with their US visas. On November 12, 2003, Good Charlotte appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. In December, the group went toured the UK with Sugarcult and Mest. In January 2004, the group performed various shows in Japan.

==Critical reception==

Reviewers were split on the album&#x27;s pop punk sound. In his brief review, rock critic Robert Christgau summarised this aspect as: &quot;honest pop band presents its songs punk, and that makes some people so mad&quot;. Mark Beaumont of &quot;NME&quot; wrote a positive review, saying that this was the &quot;sudden extra fold of punk-pop&#x27;s cerebral cortex, the evolutionary leap into an unexpected maturity&quot;. Kristina Feliciano of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; deemed the record generic, writing; &quot;These 14 tidily produced songs not only sound a lot like each other, they also resemble ones by someone else—namely, blink-182. And that band’s tunes derive from elsewhere still.&quot; The staff at &quot;Uncut&quot; was slightly more positive, commenting that while the band came across as a lighter version of Green Day, &quot;there are enough solid rock moments to keep their youthful following happy&quot;. Buffo Schnadelbach of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; noted that the &quot;somewhat stereotypical mix of cheerfully upbeat catchy tunes, slightly melancholic anthems and almost pure pop numbers gives me a lot more amusement&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Greg Kot considered the group to be &quot;much more persuasive when they let their vulnerability crack through the surface of these slightly overbaked songs, in which elaborate production touches mask the band&#x27;s three-chord limitations&quot;. R.S. Murthi of &quot;New Straits Times&quot; said the songs &quot;from a wastrel&#x27;s life aren&#x27;t always captivatingly present, at least musically&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Adrien Begrand was harsher, deducing that the band have &quot;very little musical range. All they do is play the same three chords and pop vocal melodies&quot;.

Several critics lambasted the album&#x27;s lyrics. AllMusic reviewer Tom Semioli called it &quot;downright predictable&quot; as it rejigs &quot;worn clichés aplenty on each track&quot;. &quot;Chart Attack&quot; Steve Servos complained about the &quot;clichéd lyrics of hard knocks and spoiled celebrities&quot;, going on to say that &quot;good songwriters have a knack for writing personal, therapeutic lyrics without coming across as such. Good Charlotte haven&#x27;t learned this crucial lesson yet&quot;. Begrand went further; when citing lyrics on the album that criticize reviews, he responded, &quot;Maybe if the band dropped all the pretense of their supposed punk aesthetic, from the spiky hair to the piercings, and actually wrote and produced albums that contain good, honest, DIY substance, and not this corporate rock sodapop garbage, then perhaps they could find something a bit more pertinent to complain about&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; countered this, stating that &quot;unlike the usual dumb-ass punk pop japery peddled&quot; by their peers, the band were able to do it with &quot;substance, style, and an occasional deeper exploration of sociopolitical themes&quot;. Beaumont and Janet Foreyt of &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; backed this up, with the former adding that Good Charlotte &quot;are actually Jimmy Eat World with something interesting to say&quot;, while the latter said that after &quot;several listens [...] the surprisingly intelligent lyrics begin to shine&quot;.

===Accolades and legacy===
&quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; won the Choice Music: Album award at the 2003 Teen Choice Awards. The &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; music video was nominated for Best Group Video, Best Rock Video and Viewer&#x27;s Choice awards at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards; it lost Best Group Video to &quot;The Scientist&quot; (2002) by Coldplay and Best Rock Video to &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; (2003) by Linkin Park, ultimately winning the Viewer&#x27;s Choice award. &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; won a 2003 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Award for Best Single. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; at number 89 and &quot;The Anthem&quot; at number 38 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs.

Following the release of &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot;, Good Charlotte became one of the most prominent acts of the early 2000s pop punk movement. In 2005, it was one of the launch titles for the DualDisc format. In a retrospective piece in 2012, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; stated that the album was the beginning of the band&#x27;s &quot;world domination, and opened up a LOT of doors for people just getting into rock and pop-punk circa 2002&quot;. Luke Hemmings of 5 Seconds of Summer has expressed admiration for the album. &quot;Rock Sound&quot; ranked &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; at number 22 on the list of best albums in their lifetime, number 36 on The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time list, and number 37 in 101 Modern Classics list. In 2016, the album was given the Classic Album Award at the Alternative Press Music Awards. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 19 on their list of the 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums.

<text>Master Juba (ca. 1825 – ca. 1852 or 1853) was an African-American dancer active in the 1840s. He was one of the first black performers in the United States to play onstage for white audiences and the only one of the era to tour with a white minstrel group. His real name was believed to be William Henry Lane, and he was also known as &quot;Boz&#x27;s Juba&quot; following Dickens&#x27;s graphic description of him in &quot;American Notes&quot;.

As a teenager, he began his career in the rough saloons and dance halls of Manhattan&#x27;s Five Points neighborhood, moving on to minstrel shows in the mid-1840s. &quot;Master Juba&quot; frequently challenged and defeated the best white dancers, including the period favorite, John Diamond. At the height of his American career, Juba&#x27;s act featured a sequence in which he imitated a series of famous dancers of the day and closed by performing in his own style. Being a black man, he appeared with minstrel troupes in which he imitated white minstrel dancers caricaturing black dance, obscuring his underlying ethnic identity with blackface . Even with his success in America, his greatest success came in England.

In 1848 &quot;Boz&#x27;s Juba&quot; traveled to London with the Ethiopian Serenaders, an otherwise white minstrel troupe. Boz&#x27;s Juba became a sensation in Britain for his dance style. He was a critical favorite and the most written about performer of the 1848 season. Nevertheless, an element of exploitation followed him through the British Isles, with writers treating him as an exhibit on display. Records next place Juba in both Britain and America in the early 1850s. His American critics were less kind, and Juba faded from the limelight. He died in 1852 or 1853, likely from overwork and malnutrition. He was largely forgotten by historians until a 1947 article by Marian Hannah Winter resurrected his story.

Existing documents offer confused accounts of Juba&#x27;s dancing style, but certain themes emerge: it was percussive, varied in tempo, lightning-fast at times, expressive, and unlike anything seen before. The dance likely incorporated both European folk steps, such as the Irish jig, and African-derived steps used by plantation slaves, such as the walkaround. Prior to Juba&#x27;s career, the dance of blackface performance was more faithful to black culture than its other aspects, but as blackfaced clowns and minstrels adopted elements of his style, Juba further enhanced this authenticity. By having an effect upon blackface performance, Juba was highly influential on the development of such American dance styles as tap, jazz, and step dancing.

==Early life and career==
Little is known about Juba&#x27;s life. Scant details appear in primary sources, and secondary sources—most dating to years after his death—are of dubious validity. Dance historian Marian Hannah Winter proposed that Juba was born to free parents in 1825 or later. Showman Michael B. Leavitt wrote in 1912 that Juba came from Providence, Rhode Island, and theater historian T. Allston Brown gives his real name as William Henry Lane. According to an item in the August 11, 1895 edition of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, Juba lived in New York&#x27;s Five Points District. This was a slum where Irish immigrants and free black people lived amidst brothels, dance houses, and saloons where black people regularly danced. The Irish and black populations intermingled and borrowed elements of folk culture from each other. One area of exchange was dance, and the Irish jig blended with black folk steps. In this environment, Juba learned to dance from his peers, including &quot;Uncle&quot; Jim Lowe, a black jig and reel dancer who performed in low-brow establishments. Juba was dancing for food and tossed coins by the early 1840s. Winter speculated that by about age 15, Juba had no family.

Primary sources show that Juba performed in dance competitions, minstrel shows, and variety theaters in the Northeastern United States beginning in the mid-1840s. The stage name &quot;Juba&quot; probably derives from the juba dance, itself named for the central or west African term &quot;giouba&quot;. &quot;Jube&quot; and &quot;Juba&quot; were common names for slaves in this period, especially those rumored to have dancing or musical talent. Documentation is confusing, as there were at least two black dancers using the name Juba at this time. For example, in 1840 a man named Lewis Davis was using the name &quot;Master Juber&quot; and making his living &quot;travelling through the states, dancing negro extravaganzas, breakdowns, &amp;c&quot;. He was arrested for theft in New York City.

An anonymous letter from 1841 or early 1842 in the tabloid newspaper the &quot;Sunday Flash&quot; states that Juba was working for showman P. T. Barnum. The writer stated that Barnum had managed the dancer since 1840, when he had disguised the boy as a white minstrel performer—by making him up in blackface—and put him on at the New York Vauxhall Gardens. In 1841, the letter alleges, Barnum went so far as to present his charge as the Irish-American performer John Diamond, the most celebrated dancer of the day. The letter further accuses Barnum of entering Juba-as-Diamond in rigged dance competitions against other performers:

The boy is fifteen or sixteen years of age; his name is &quot;Juba;&quot; and to do him justice, he is a very fair dancer. He is of harmless and inoffensive disposition, and is not, I sincerely believe, aware of the meanness and audacity of the swindler to which he is presently a party. As to the wagers which the bills daily blazon forth, they are like the rest of his business—all a cheat. Not one dollar is ever bet or staked, and the pretended judges who aid in the farce, are mere &quot;blowers&quot;.

Writer Thomas Low Nichols supported parts of the story in an 1864 book of social history. He states that in 1841 Diamond quit his work as a dancer in the employ of Barnum and was replaced by &quot;a genuine negro&quot;, whom Barnum billed as &quot;the champion nigger-dancer of the world&quot;. The black dancer would have debuted in the spring of 1841. Nichols never identified the dancer as Juba, but later writers concluded that the boy was that performer. Historian Eric Lott has identified the irony of this arrangement: a black man imitating a white man imitating a black man.

Beginning in the early 1840s, Juba began a series of dance competitions known as challenge dances. He faced white rival John Diamond, who advertised that he &quot;delineate[d] the Ethiopian character superior to any other &quot;white&quot; person&quot;. Sources disagree about the date of their first contest; it may have occurred while Diamond was still working for Barnum or a year or two later. This advertisement from the July 8, 1844, &quot;New York Herald&quot; is typical of the publicity the matches generated:

GREAT PUBLIC CONTEST

Between the two most renowned dancers in the world, the Original JOHN DIAMOND and the colored boy JUBA, for a Wager of $200, on MONDAY EVENING July 8 at the BOWERY AMPHITHEATRE, which building has been expressly hired from the Proprietor, Mr. Smith, for this night only, as its accommodations will afford all a fair view of each step of these wonderful Dancers. The fame of these two Celebrated Breakdown Dancers has already spread over the Union, and the numerous friends of each claim the Championship for their favorite, and who have anxiously wished for a Public Trial between them and thus known which is to bear the Title of the Champion Dancer of the World. The time to decide that has come, as the friends of Juba have challenged the world to produce his superior in the art for $100. That Challenge has been accepted by the friends of Diamond, and on Monday Evening they meet and Dance three Jigs, Two Reels, and the Camptown Hornpipe. Five Judges have been selected for their ability and knowledge of the Art, so that a fair decision will be made.

Rule—Each Dancer will select his own Violin and the victory will be decided by the best time and the greatest number of steps.

Historian James W. Cook has suggested that Juba and Diamond may have staged their first competition as a form of mutual publicity. Claims of black superiority over an acclaimed white rival were otherwise unheard of in the climate of racial segregation and white supremacy that permeated New York City and the country at large in the mid-1840s.

Challenge dances usually employed three judges. One sat on the stage and counted time, another sat in or near the orchestra pit and judged style, and the third went under the stage and observed the dancer&#x27;s execution to listen for &quot;missing taps, defective rolls and heel work, the lagging in the breaks&quot;. After the dance, they compared notes and chose the winner. Audience members and friends of the competitors bet on the outcome and could name the victor by popular acclaim in the case the judges could not come to a decision. According to an undated reference by Leavitt, Juba lost one challenge, at the Boylston Gardens in Boston, but records show that he beat Diamond in all other competitions. An undated clipping from the Harvard Theatre Collection, written by a fan of minstrelsy, describes the single dance competition that Diamond managed to win: &quot;One of the fiddlers played a reel for him [Juba], and he shuffled, and twisted, and walked around, and danced on for one hour and fifteen minutes by the watch.&quot; Then Juba made a loud strike with his left foot as the crowd cheered and he got a drink from the bar. Diamond was next and tried to act cool but resolute. He knew that he would displease Barnum by losing and he had his race at stake: &quot;There was another thing about this match-dance that made Diamond want to win. You see it was not only a case of Barnum&#x27;s Museum against Pete Williams&#x27;s dance-house, but it was a case of white against black. So Jack Diamond went at his dancin&#x27; with double energy—first, for his place, next, for his color.&quot; He beat Juba&#x27;s time and &quot;gave a hop, skip and a jump, a yell and a bow&quot;. A black man shouted out, &quot;He&#x27;s a white man, sure ... but he&#x27;s got a nigger in his heel.&quot; The two had their most famous matchup in New York City in 1844, where Juba beat Diamond for $500. Juba then traveled to Boston, billing himself as the &quot;King of All the Dancers&quot;, and played for two weeks, with competitions versus Frank Diamond (no relation to John).

In 1842, English writer Charles Dickens toured New York&#x27;s Five Points. This was around the time of the challenge dances, and Dickens was possibly drawn by rumors of Barnum&#x27;s disguising of a black youth as a white minstrel performer. There the writer witnessed a performance by &quot;a lively young negro&quot; at the Almack&#x27;s tavern and brothel at 67 Orange Street in the infamous Mulberry Bend. The November 11, 1842, edition of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; later identified this dancer as Juba. Dickens wrote in his &quot;American Notes&quot;,

The corpulent black fiddler, and his friend who plays the tambourine, stamp upon the boarding of the small raised orchestra in which they sit, and play a lively measure. Five or six couples come upon the floor, marshalled by a lively young negro, who is the wit of the assembly, and the greatest dancer known. He never leaves off making queer faces, and is the delight of all the rest, who grin from ear to ear incessantly ...

... But the dance commences. Every gentleman sets as long as he likes to the opposite lady, and the opposite lady to him, and all are so long about it that the sport begins to languish, when suddenly the lively hero dashes in to the rescue. Instantly the fiddler grins, and goes at it tooth and nail; there is new energy in the tambourine; new laughter in the dancers; new smiles in the landlady; new confidence in the landlord; new brightness in the very candles.

Single shuffle, double shuffle, cut and cross-cut; snapping his fingers, rolling his eyes, turning in his knees, presenting the backs of his legs in front, spinning about on his toes and heels like nothing but the man&#x27;s fingers on the tambourine; dancing with two left legs, two right legs, two wooden legs, two wire legs, two spring legs—all sorts of legs and no legs—what is this to him? And in what walk of life, or dance of life, does man ever get such stimulating applause as thunders about him, when, having danced his partner off her feet, and himself too, he finishes by leaping gloriously on the bar-counter, and calling for something to drink, with the chuckle of a million of counterfeit Jim Crows, in one inimitable sound!

Juba may have capitalized on the free publicity given him by Dickens as he made the jump from the saloon to the stage. An undated excerpt from the &quot;New York Herald&quot; describes Juba&#x27;s appearance with a minstrel troupe at Pete Williams&#x27; dance hall on Orange Street:

... [T]hose who passed through the long hallway and entered the dance hall, after paying their shilling to the darky doorkeeper, whose &quot;box-office&quot; was a plain soap box, or a wooden one of that description, saw this phenomenon, &quot;Juba,&quot; imitate all the dancers of the day and their special steps. Then Bob Ellingham, the interlocutor and master of ceremonies, would say, &quot;Now, Master Juba, show your own jig.&quot; Whereupon he would go through all his own steps and specialties, with never a resemblance in any of them to those he had just imitated.

In this performance, Juba imitated the white minstrel performers Richard Pelham, Frank Brower, John Daniels, John Smith, James Sanford, Frank Diamond, and John Diamond. The idea that Juba could &quot;imitate himself&quot; after mimicking his rivals points up, according to Lott, &quot;minstrelsy&#x27;s fundamental consequence for black culture, the dispossession and control by whites of black forms that would not for a long time be recovered&quot;. Nevertheless, Juba&#x27;s imitations of his white rivals asserted his greater mastery of the styles then current in Blackface dance. They also asserted that this was an artistic medium worthy of imitation. James W. Cook writes, &quot;in a sense, the Imitation Dance served as a powerful act of defiance from someone who, more typically, would have lacked any means of broader representational control&quot;.

Dancers came to recognize Juba as the best, and his fame soared. By 1845, he was so well known that he no longer had to impersonate a white minstrel on stage. He toured through New England with the Georgia Champion Minstrels in 1844. The bill called him &quot;The Wonder of the World Juba, Acknowledged to be the Greatest Dancer in the World. Having danced with John Diamond at the Chatham Theatre for $500, and at the Bowery Theatre for the same amount, and established himself as the King of All Dancers. No conception can be formed of the variety of beautiful and intricate steps exhibited by him with ease. You must see to believe.&quot;

In 1845, Juba began touring with the Ethiopian Minstrels. The troupe gave him top billing over its four white members, unprecedented for a black performer. From 1846, Juba toured with White&#x27;s Serenaders, under the tutelage of Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; White, as a dancer and tambourine player off and on until at least 1850. He played a character named Ikey Vanjacklen, &quot;the barber&#x27;s boy&quot; in a piece called &quot;Going for the Cup, or, Old Mrs. Williams&#x27;s Dance&quot;, one of the earliest known minstrel sketches. It focused on Juba&#x27;s dancing in a milieu of competition and showing off. The plot follows two characters trying to fix a dance contest by soaping the floor in a way that will make all of the competitors fall except Ikey. They bet on Vanjacklen, but in the end, the judge steals the money.

==England tour, 1848==
In 1848, a dancer billed as &quot;Boz&#x27;s Juba&quot; performed in London, England. He was a member of the Ethiopian Serenaders, a blackface minstrel troupe under the leadership of Gilbert W. Pell (or Pelham). The company had performed in England two years prior, when they had made minstrelsy palatable to middle-class British audiences by adopting refinements such as formal wear. With Boz&#x27;s Juba as its newest member, the company toured middle-class theaters and lecture halls in the British Isles for the next 18 months.

The identity of Boz&#x27;s Juba is open to doubt. &quot;Boz&quot; was a pen name used by Dickens. The Ethiopian Serenaders quoted from Dickens&#x27;s &quot;American Notes&quot; in their press releases, and &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; considered the black dancer to be the same person Dickens had seen in New York in 1842. Dickens never refuted the claims. Nevertheless, the Serenaders&#x27; assertions were promotional, and Dickens may not have remembered the exact look or characteristics of the dancer he had seen in the Five Points. Writers from the period and later have generally identified Boz&#x27;s Juba as the same person Dickens had seen during his visit to New York and who had danced against Diamond.

Boz&#x27;s Juba seems to have been a full member of Pell&#x27;s troupe. He wore blackface makeup and played the endman, Mr. Tambo (a tambourine player) opposite Pell&#x27;s Mr. Bones (on the bone castanets). He sang standard minstrel songs, such as &quot;Juliana Johnson&quot; and &quot;Come Back, Steben&quot;, and he performed in sketches and &quot;conundrum&quot; contests. Despite this apparent level of integration into the act, advertisements for the troupe set Juba&#x27;s name apart from the other members. The Serenaders continued through Britain and played establishments such as the Vauxhall Gardens. The tour ended in 1850. Its run of 18 months was the longest uninterrupted minstrel tour in Britain at that time. Juba and Pell then joined the troupe headed by Pell&#x27;s brother, Richard Pelham. The company was renamed G. W. Pell&#x27;s Serenaders.

Juba was the most written about performer in London for the summer 1848 season, no easy feat considering the large number of competitors. He proved a critical favorite, with commentators doting on him praise normally accorded to popular ballet dancers. That August, the &quot;Theatrical Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The performances of this young man are far above the common performances of the mountebanks who give imitations of American and Negro character; there is an ideality in what he does that makes his efforts at once grotesque and poetical, without losing sight of the reality of representation.&quot; An anonymous clipping from the 1848 season says,

[T]he dancing of Juba exceeded anything ever witnessed in Europe ... The American Juba has for some years drawn immense audiences whenever he has appeared. He is quite young, being only in his seventeenth year. Mr. Dickens, in his &#x27;American Notes,&#x27; gives a graphic description of this extraordinary youth, who, we doubt not, before many weeks have elapsed, will have the honor of displaying his dancing attainments in Buckingham Palace.

One reviewer wrote, &quot;Juba is a musician, as well as a dancer. To him, the intricate management of the nigger tambourine is confined, and from it he produces marvelous harmonies . We almost question whether, upon a great emergency, he could not play a fugue upon it&quot;. His only known negative review during his British tour came from &quot;The Puppet-Show&quot; on August 12, 1848:

The principal feature in entertainments at Vauxhall is Juba: as such at least he is put forth—or rather put first—by the proprietors. Out of compliment to Dickens, this extraordinary nigger is called &#x27;Boz&#x27;s Juba,&#x27; in consequence, we believe, of the popular writer having said a good word for him in his American Notes: on this principle we could not mention the Industrious Fleas as being clever without having those talented little animals puffed all over London as being under the overwhelming patronage of the Showman. Juba&#x27;s talent consists in walking round the stage with an air of satisfaction and with his toes turned in; in jumping backwards in a less graceful manner than we should have conceived possible; and in shaking his thighs like a man afflicted with palsy. He makes a terrible clatter with his feet, not owing so much to activity on his part as to stupidity on the part of his boot-maker, who has furnished him with a pair of clumsy Wellingtons sufficiently large for the feet and legs of all the Ethiopians in London: besides this, he sometimes moves about the stage on his knees, as if he was praying to be endowed with intelligence, and had unlimited credit with his tailor. As a last resource, he falls back on the floor ...

The piece goes on to describe a drunken man the critic met after Juba&#x27;s performance:

When again we saw him he was labouring (like a horse—or, rather, an ass) under the influence of champagne. We understood that he was imitating Juba, and he behaved so ridiculously that he may actually be said to have surpassed him.

Master Juba&#x27;s stint with Pell makes him the earliest known black performer to tour with a white minstrel troupe. Scholars disagree over why he was allowed to do so. Dance historian Marian Hannah Winter argues that Juba was simply too talented to be held back. Dance historian Stephen Johnson sees Juba&#x27;s talent as less central to the matter, and emphasizes the element of exoticism and exhibition in the tour. During the same period, exhibits of Arab families, Bushmen, Kaffir Zulus, and Ojibway warriors appeared in London. A reviewer for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; gave an almost anthropological description of Juba, unheard of for other performers:

But the great feature of the entertainment, and that which we imagine attracted the large and respectable audience present, was undoubtedly &quot;Master Juba,&quot; the immortalized of Boz. This &quot;phenomenon&quot; (as the bills describe him) is a copper-coloured votary of Terpsichore,—the Monsieur Perrot of Negro life in the southern states; and possesses the additional attraction of being a &quot;real nigger,&quot; and not a &quot;sham,&quot; like his vocal associates. He is apparently about eighteen years of age; about 5 feet 3 inches in height; of slender make, yet possessing great muscular activity. His head is very small, and his countenance, when at rest, has a rather mild, sedate, and far from unpleasing expression.

Pell&#x27;s advertising repeatedly alleged that Juba&#x27;s dance was authentic, and the reviewers seem to have believed him. The same Manchester critic remarked that Juba&#x27;s dances &quot;illustrated the dances of his own simple people on festive occasions&quot;. The few reviews of Juba as a solo performer after his tour with Pell (and thus out of the exhibitionist mode) are more negative. Dance scholar Thomas DeFrantz has said that Master Juba&#x27;s stage persona &quot;buffered associations between the potent black body onstage and the preferred impotent everyday, male slave body&quot;. Scholar of African American studies Maurice O. Wallace adds that Juba was an example of how &quot;those strategies of black cultural performance ... have historically coalesced to shape black masculine subjecthood in Eurocentric contexts&quot;. However, Wallace cautions that by the time Juba had reached London, he had &quot;[transcended] the racial gaze&quot; and was seen as a dancer first and black man second.

==Later life and death, 1850-1854==
Back in the United States, Juba performed a solo act in working-class music halls, concert saloons, and &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; in nondescript theaters in New York: he had gone from obscurity to the limelight and back again. The American critics were not as kind as their English counterparts. A reviewer for the &quot;Era&quot; wrote on August 4, 1850, that &quot;[Juba is] jumping very fast at the Colosseum, but too fast is worse than too slow, and we advise [Juba] to be wise in time. It is easier to jump down than to jump up&quot;; and on August 11, 1850, &quot;Juba has jumped away—by the way of an earnest yet friendly caution, let us hope that he will not throw himself away. Be wise in time is a wholesome motto&quot;. The &quot;Huddersfield Chronicle and West Yorkshire Advertiser&quot; on November 30, 1850, wrote, &quot;The performances of Boz&#x27;s Juba have created quite a sensation in the gallery, who greeted his marvellous feats of dancing with thunders of applause and a standing encore. In all the rougher and less refined departments of his art, Juba is a perfect master.&quot;

The last known record of Juba places him at the City Tavern in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1851: &quot;Boz&#x27;s Juba appears here nightly and is well received&quot;. A performer known as Jumbo is reported as having died two weeks later in Dublin. Dance historian Marian Hannah Winter said that Juba died in 1852 in London. More than 30 years later, theater historian T. Allston Brown wrote that Juba &quot;married too late (and a white woman besides), and died early and miserably. In a note addressed to Charley White, Juba informed him that, when next he should be seen by him [White], he would be riding in his own carriage. It has been said that in 1852 his skeleton, without the carriage, was on exhibition at the Surrey Music Hall, Sheffield, England.&quot; Mahar has given the date as 1853. He would have been in his late 20s.

During January 1854 the English newspaper &quot;Northern Daily Times&quot; carried adverts for a show at the Royal Colosseum Theatre in Paradise Street, Liverpool, featuring &quot;the celebrated Boz&#x27;s Juba, immortalised by Charles Dickens in his notes on America&quot;. In 1854 a cholera epidemic broke out in Liverpool, causing heavy mortality. On 3 February 1854 the death was registered in the city of a man named &quot;Bois Juba&quot; and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography accepts &quot;Bois Juba&quot; as a probable clerical error for &quot;Boz&#x27;s Juba&quot;, the sobriquet by which Juba was best known in England. It points out that other biographical details given on the death certificate - that the deceased was an American-born musician, aged 30 - correspond to Juba&#x27;s. &quot;Bois Juba&quot; was registered as having died in the fever ward of the Brownlow Hill infirmary in Liverpool, and was buried on 6 February 1854 in the free part of the cemetery of the nearby church of St Martin&#x27;s. St Martin&#x27;s was damaged by bombing during World War II and later demolished, and although graveyard burials were re-interred at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Walton-on-the-Hill the exact location of Juba&#x27;s grave is therefore unknown.

The cause of Juba&#x27;s death is a matter of speculation. Winter cited his &quot;almost superhuman schedule&quot; and the &quot;[burning] up his energies and health&quot; as the culprits. Assuming all of the Jubas are the same person, the record suggests that Juba worked day and night for 11 years—from 1839 to 1850. Especially in his early days, Juba worked for food, and would have been served the typical tavern meal of the time, fried eels and ale. Such a demanding schedule, coupled with poor food and little sleep, likely doomed Juba to his early death.

==Performance style==
Playbills tell us, broadly, what Juba did during his performances. No known description of Juba&#x27;s dancing by a contemporary was written by anyone of his own race, class, or profession. While he was clearly a remarkable dancer, it is impossible to gain precise knowledge of his style and technique, or of the degree to which he differed from his largely forgotten black contemporaries. The sources lack precise points of comparison. The more detailed accounts come from British critics, to whom Juba must have been more of a novelty than to Americans. These writers were catering to a white, middle class, British audience. Other descriptions come from promotional material and thus cannot be trusted to be objective. Juba was described as a &quot;jig dancer&quot; at a time when the word still connoted Irish folk dancing but was in the process of changing to encompass black dance. The Irish jig was common at this time, so skillful improvisation may account for the inordinate amount of attention Juba received.

These accounts offer only ambiguous choreographic descriptions. While these descriptions often offer exacting detail, they contradict one another. Some attempt an almost scientific precision, while others emphasize the impossibility of Juba&#x27;s style. The reviews do agree that Juba&#x27;s dance was novel to the point of indescribability, frenzied, varied in tempo and tone, well-timed, percussive, and expressive.

He was an integral member of the troupes with which he toured, as evidenced by the roles he played in the minstrel show presented by Pell&#x27;s Ethiopian Serenaders. Juba did three dances in two forms. He performed &quot;festival&quot; and &quot;plantation&quot; dances in formal attire with Thomas F. Briggs on banjo, and dressed in drag to perform the role of Lucy Long in the song of that name, sung by Pell. There is little evidence to indicate whether Juba portrayed the wench role in sexual or burlesque style. However, a review from Manchester, England, implies that it was the former:

With a most bewitching bonnet and veil, a very pink dress, beflounced to the waist, lace-fringed trousers of the most spotless purity, and red leather boots,—the ensemble completed by the green parasol and white cambric pocket handkerchief,—Master Juba certainly looked the black demoiselle of the first ton to the greatest advantage. The playing and singing by the serenaders of a version of the well-known negro ditty, furnished the music to Juba&#x27;s performance, which was after this fashion:-Promenading in a circle to the left for a few bars, till again facing the audience, he then commenced a series of steps, which altogether baffle description, from their number, oddity, and the rapidity with which they were executed ... The promenade was then repeated; then more dancing; and so on, to the end of the song.

Existing images of Juba offer more hints. Two depictions, from a review of Juba at the Vauxhall Gardens, published in &quot;The Puppet-Show&quot; on August 12, 1848, show a drunken man imitating Juba&#x27;s performance; he seems to be doing a cake-walk, his leg kicked high, his hat in his extended arm. A caricature of Juba shows him with knees bent and legs spread, one leg poised to land hard on the floor; arms in close. The most common image of Juba, originally from June 18, 1848, edition of &quot;The Era&quot;, shows him in a position similar to this one; his hands rest in his pockets. One British account, in an issue of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; from August 5, 1848, is accompanied by an illustration that shows Juba performing what seems to be a jig.

===Indescribability===
Writers struggled to find words to describe what they saw Juba do. A Brighton reviewer wrote that &quot;[t]he effort baffles description. It is certainly original, and unlike anything we have ever seen before&quot;. Another wrote of &quot;a series of steps, which altogether baffle description, from their number, oddity, and the rapidity with which they were executed&quot;. Writers struggled to compare Juba&#x27;s steps to forms familiar to British audiences. Inevitably, the comparisons were to rural folk dances or to those of the exotic reaches of the British Empire:

The dances he introduced were distinguished for eccentricity, rapidity of motion, and the accuracy of the time kept. They approximated, in some respects, to those wild dances that may be witnessed sometimes in the remoter parts of the Highlands, including the sword dance, as there known; besides having the same idea of clanking the heels, as pervades the Polka. But it is not the office of the legs alone to do all this; the head, arms, and body generally take full share of duty, and assume such extraordinary positions, that only a being possessed of the power of Proteus could calculate upon taking.

Nevertheless, such comparisons cannot be taken as true indications of Juba&#x27;s personal style. As a blackface minstrel, and thus parodist, Juba may have incorporated conscious parodies of such dances into his act. He also made facial expressions as he danced. Charles Dickens wrote of the young black dancer in New York that &quot;[h]e never leaves off making queer faces&quot;.

===Eccentricity===
Juba seems to have presented varied styles at different tempos during a single performance. Confused reviewers struggled to explain how he moved each part of his body independently at its own speed and how he repeatedly changed his rhythm and tone. A critic for &quot;The Morning Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Now he languishes, now burns, now love seems to sway his motions, and anon rage seems to impel his steps.&quot; A London audience member who saw Juba at the Vauxhall Gardens wondered, &quot;How could he tie his legs into such knots, and fling them about so recklessly, or make his feet twinkle until you lose sight of them altogether in his energy.&quot; &quot;The Mirror and United Kingdom Magazine&quot; declared, &quot;Such mobility of muscles, such flexibility of joints, such boundings, such slidings, such gyrations, such toes and such heelings, such backwardings and forwardings, such posturings, such firmness of foot, such elasticity of tendon, such mutation of movement, such vigour, such variety, such natural grace, such powers of endurance, such potency of pastern.&quot; The &quot;Manchester Examiner&quot; captured something of the rhythm of Juba&#x27;s performance:

Surely he cannot be flesh and blood, but some more subtle substance, or how could he turn, and twine, and twist, and twirl, and hop, and jump, and kick, and throw his feet almost with a velocity that makes one think they are playing hide-and seek with a flash of lightning! Heels or toes, on feet or on knees, on the ground or off, it is all the same to Juba; his limbs move as if they were stuffed with electric wires ...

===Percussion===
The percussive sounds Juba made during his performances were another element that distinguished his dance from standard Irish jigs. Contemporary reviewers often alluded to these sounds. Playbills asked audiences to remain silent during Juba&#x27;s dances so they could hear the percussion of his steps. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; remarked, &quot;To us, the most interesting part of the performance was the exact time, which, even in the most complicated and difficult steps, the dancer kept to the music.&quot; An anonymous clipping from c. 1848 said, &quot;... the dancing of Juba exceeded anything ever witnessed in Europe. The style as well as the execution is unlike anything ever seen in this country. The manner in which he beats time with his feet, and the extraordinary command he possesses over them, can only be believed by those who have been present at his exhibition.&quot; A critic in Liverpool compared his steps to Pell on the bones and Briggs on the banjo. &quot;The Morning Post&quot; wrote, &quot;He trills, he shakes, he screams, he laughs, as though by the very genius of African melody.&quot; Descriptions also show elements of the hand jive in his dance.

Juba accompanied his dances with rapid-fire laughter synchronized to the tempo of the dance. An anonymous London critic wrote,

[T]here never was such a laugh as the laugh of Juba—there is in it the concentrated laugh of fifty comic pantomimes; it has no relation to the chuckle, and, least of all to the famous horse laugh; not a bit of it—it is a laugh distinct, a laugh apart, a laugh by itself—clear, ringing, echoing, resonant, harmonious, full of rejoicing and mighty mirth, and fervent fun; you may hear it like the continuous humming sound of nature, permeating everywhere; it enters your heart and you laugh sympathetically—it creeps into your ear, and clings to it, and all the subsequent sounds seemed to be endued with the cachinatory quality ... &quot;Well, though the laugh of Juba be wondrous, what may be said of Juba&#x27;s dancing?&quot;

===Authenticity===
Juba&#x27;s dance certainly incorporated elements of authentic black culture, but to what extent is uncertain. Elements of Juba&#x27;s style are part of the black dance aesthetic: percussion, variable time signature, use of the body as an instrument, changes in tone and pacing, extreme gestures and poses, and emphasis on solo dancing. Juba may very well have exuded Africa&#x27;s cool aesthetic: composure and vitality.

Historians have ascribed the inability of British critics to describe Juba&#x27;s style to his use of African-derived forms unfamiliar to the British middle class. White accounts of his performances reflect similar descriptions of slave dances from the Caribbean and the United States. Juba was heir to the traditions of free northern black people, and Johnson has pointed to evidence that he was performing &quot;a quite specific, African-infused plantation dance&quot;. Descriptions of his dance hint that Juba performed black steps such as the walk-around, the pigeon wing, a primordial Charleston, the long-bow J, trucking, the turkey trot, the backward spring, the wailing jawbone, and tracking upon the heel. However, Johnson cautions that &quot;I might see any number of dance steps here, if I look longingly enough.&quot;

Juba was in a white-dominated field playing for largely white audiences; he likely compromised his culture&#x27;s music and dance in order to survive in show business. This was true of his comedy sketches and songs, which did not stray from standard minstrel fare. One London observer in the 1840s who witnessed slave dances on a South Carolina plantation called them &quot;poor shufflings compared to the pedal inspirations of Juba&quot;. Juba&#x27;s dance may have been an amalgamation of African and European precedents. Dickens&#x27;s piece on the New York dancer, describing leg movements only, points to the Irish jig, but he also refers to Juba performing the single and double shuffle, which are black-derived steps. Historians Shane and Graham White have argued that black people of this period performed European steps in a different style from whites. Historian Robert Toll has written that Juba &quot;had learned a European dance, blended it with African tradition, and produced a new form, an Afro-American dance that had a great impact on minstrelsy&quot;. Dance historians Marshall and Jean Stearns have agreed, saying that &quot;in the person of William Henry Lane, the blend of British folk with American Negro dance in the United States had, by 1848, resulted in a striking new development. So foreign observers, who were in a position to view its emergence objectively, treated it as an original creation.&quot;

==Legacy and historiography==
The terms &quot;juba dancer&quot; and &quot;juba dancing&quot; became common in variety theaters after Master Juba popularized them. Actors, minstrels, and British clowns inspired by Juba and other minstrels adopted blackface and performed dances similar to Juba&#x27;s as a stage character called the &quot;Gay Negro Boy&quot;. The character spread to France (from 1860) and Belgium (from 1865) when British circuses toured there. Elements of these dances were still found among British whiteface clowns as late as the 1940s. Juba&#x27;s rave reception in Manchester may have presaged that city&#x27;s later status as the center of dance in the United Kingdom. Less happily, Juba reinforced the racist caricature of the naturally musical black among white audiences.

While the name &quot;Juba&quot; passed into dance history, for many decades the man himself did not. William Henry Lane is considered to be at the forefront of blackface minstrelsy entertainment. He died in 1854 in a workhouse in Liverpool, of fever. For over 90 years after his death, Juba was largely forgotten by dancers and historians, appearing only in brief passages in sources such as histories of minstrelsy. Stephen Johnson has postulated that this indicates that either white entertainers and historians consciously downplayed Juba&#x27;s significance, or that Juba was simply not that influential. Even black historians ignored Juba until the mid-20th century, preferring to focus on Juba&#x27;s older and more obviously respectable contemporary Ira Aldridge, an African American actor who became a leading light of the European stage.

In 1947, dance and popular culture historian Marian Hannah Winter began the resurrection of Juba&#x27;s reputation with her article &quot;Juba and American Minstrelsy&quot;. Juba, according to Winter, surmounted the hurdles of race and class to succeed as a professional dancer. Winter was the first to write of Juba as a man who introduced elements of African dance to the Western lexicon and thus fostered the creation of a distinct American dance idiom. In so doing, Juba, according to Winter, reclaimed for African Americans elements that had been stolen in the racist culture of 19th-century America and, in the process, invented tap dancing. In short, Winter &quot;made [Juba] significant&quot;.

When Winter wrote her article, there was little scholarship in African American studies, dance history, or minstrelsy studies. Winter based her article on, at most, six sources. Nonetheless, later writers have largely accepted and echoed her thesis. As recently as 1997, musicologist Dale Cockrell wrote that &quot;[t]he best treatment of Juba, though it is shot through with errors, is still Winter 1948&quot;. Winter&#x27;s view that Juba was the &quot;most influential single performer of nineteenth-century American dance&quot; is now the consensus. His career shows that black and white people actually did collaborate to an extent in blackface minstrelsy.

Scholars in recent decades have repeatedly pointed to Juba as the progenitor of tap dancing and, by extension, step dancing. Winter wrote that &quot;[t]he repertoire of any current tap-dancer contains elements which were established theatrically by him&quot;. Dancer Mark Knowles has echoed this assertion, calling Juba &quot;America&#x27;s first real tap dancer&quot;. Music historian Eileen Southern calls him the &quot;principal black professional minstrel of the antebellum period (and) a link between the white world and authentic black source material&quot;. Scholars point to Juba as the first African American to insert aspects of authentic black culture into American dance and theater. In so doing, Juba ensured that blackface dance was more authentically African than the other elements of the minstrel show. Wallace has gone so far as to call Juba &quot;the &quot;pater alios&quot; of black masculine dance history, and the &#x27;initiator and determinant of the form itself,&#x27; a form which lends visible expression to the difficult dialectics of black masculinity&quot;. Johnson, however, has cautioned against this interpretation. His reading of the primary sources sees more evidence of eccentricity in Juba&#x27;s dance than of a proto-tap or -jazz.

<text>The Vice Presidential Service Badge is an identification badge of the United States Armed Forces which is awarded to members of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard as well as other members of the uniformed services, such as the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps and the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, who serve as full-time uniformed service aides to the vice president. It was established under by President Richard Nixon on July 8, 1970 and was modified by President Gerald R. Ford on July 19, 1976 under .

Uniformed service personnel eligible to receive the Vice Presidential Service Badge are active-duty members of the military, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Public Health Service who are posted to the Office of the Vice President, located in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the West Wing of the White House. Such personnel include military public affairs officers, security specialists, and liaison specialists from the various branches of the U.S. military, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Public Health Service.

The Vice Presidential Service Badge is considered a permanent decoration and is authorized for continued wear throughout a uniformed service career, even when one no longer serves the vice president. The badge is very similar to the Presidential Service Badge, authorized for uniformed service personnel assigned to the staff of the president of the United States. Recipients are the only Americans authorized to wear the &quot;Vice Presidential Seal or Coat of Arms&quot; on their uniforms or civilian clothes.

<text>Juba was a writer who lived at the end of the 2nd century or in the 3rd century CE. He wrote a now-lost treatise on metric, based on Heliodorus and used by later grammarians. He was previously identified with Juba II, the king of Mauretania, but this interpretation is now rejected on chronological ground.

* 25-point programme – The Nazi Party platform and a codification of its ideology.

==A==
* &quot;Abbeförderung&quot; (&#x27;dispatching&#x27;, &#x27;removal&#x27;) – euphemism for killing.

* Adolphe Légalité – derisory nickname for Hitler in social-revolutionary SA circles following the Reichswehr Trial held before the Leipzig Supreme Court in late September 1930. In the eyes of radical National Socialists, Hitler&#x27;s Legality Oath had conceded too much to his political enemies, in the same way as had the Duke of Orléans, who adopted the name Philippe Égalité during the French Revolution.
* &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; - German Africa Corps (DAK) of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.
* &quot;agrarpolitischer Apparat&quot; (aA; &#x27;Agrarian Apparatus&#x27;) – Agricultural Affairs Bureau of the NSDAP, responsible for promoting &quot;Blut und Boden&quot; ideology.

* &quot;Akademiker&quot; (&#x27;academic&#x27;) – a member of those professions whose exercise required university study as a prerequisite. The term was avoided because it fostered caste mentality and contradicted the ideal of the Volk community. The proportion of academics from a working-class background increased during the Nazi era, but remained minuscule in actual numbers.
* &quot;Auf Kriegsdauer&quot; (a. Kr.; &#x27;for the duration of the war&#x27;) – added to titles to indicate the limited promotion prospects for bureaucrats.

Laborers – facetiously called &quot;Sonderkommando 1005&quot; (&#x27;special commando/s 1005&#x27;) – would be taken under guard to a closed death camp to clear the site of structures while a sub-unit, the &quot;Leichenkommandos&quot; (&#x27;corpse commandos&#x27;), were forced to exhume bodies from mass graves, burn the remains (usually on timber and iron-rail &quot;roasts&quot;), and sometimes to grind down larger bone pieces in portable bone-crusher mills. Some &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; mass graves were also cleared out. (Note: without the &quot;1005&quot; appended, in the camps the word &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; (lit. &#x27;special unit&#x27;) euphemistically referred to prisoner-laborers generally who stoked the crematoria, shaved newcomers&#x27; hair, processed seized belongings, etc., but were not involved in the exhuming action.)
* &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot; (&#x27;mission/action Reinhardt&#x27;) – code name given on 4 June 1942 for the assignment to exterminate all Polish Jews in honor of SS Deputy Chief Reinhard Heydrich who had been assassinated during a covert operation.
* &quot;Aktion T4&quot; – code name for the extermination of mentally ill and handicapped patients by the Nazi authorities. (Named after Tiergartenstraße 4, the address of Nazi Central Office in Berlin.)
* &quot;Aktivismus&quot; (&#x27;activism&#x27;) – political maxim of National Socialism as a &quot;fighting movement&quot;, as opposed to &quot;bourgeois passivity&quot;.

* &quot;Alles für Deutschland&quot; (&#x27;everything/anything for Germany&#x27;) – Motto applied to the blades of uniform daggers worn by the SA and National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK).
* &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; (general SS) – general overall body of the SS which included full-time, part-time, active, inactive, and honorary members.
* &quot;Alljuda&quot; – antisemitic Germanization of the term &quot;international Jewry&quot; that borrowed from the word &quot;alldeutsch&quot; (&#x27;pan-German&#x27;), as in the antisemitic slogan &quot;All-Germany against All-Jewry!&quot; The National Socialists used the word &quot;Alljuda&quot; to suggest the &quot;Allgegenwart&quot; (&#x27;omnipresence&#x27;) of the Jewish danger and the &quot;world conspiracy of Judaism&quot;; aggressive terminology that degraded Zionism
* &quot;Alpenfestung&quot; (&#x27;Alpine Fortress&#x27;) – the region on the Obersalzberg where Hitler was originally supposed to retreat when conducting the battle against the Allies. Hitler never used the &quot;Alpenfestung&quot; in this capacity and retreated instead into the bunker in Berlin.

The &quot;old fighters&quot; tended to be the most extreme anti-Semitics in the party.
* &quot;Altreich&quot; (&#x27;old country&#x27;) – after the annexation of Austria in 1938, referred to the part of Germany that was within the 1937 (pre-annexation) boundaries.

* &quot;Amtswalter&quot; (&#x27;office steward&#x27;) – Old German-sounding Nazi synonym for &quot;official&quot; or &quot;civil servant&quot; (&quot;Beamter&quot;) and therefore the preferred term for professional functionaries of the party and its branches. Those persons working in the state apparatus continued to be called &quot;Beamte&quot;.
* &quot;Amt Feierabend&quot; (&#x27;Office for After-Work Activity&#x27;) – aimed to organize workers&#x27; after-work activities as part of the Strength Through Joy policy.

* &quot;Arbeitnehmerschaft&quot; (&#x27;workforce&#x27;) – the Nazis took this word to mean both manual and mental workers.
* &quot;Arbeitertum der Faust und der Stirn&quot; (&#x27;Workers of both manual and mental labor&#x27;) – blue-collar and white-collar workers. This was the Nazi Party self-description as an &quot;all-inclusive workers&#x27; party&quot;.

In most instances, they were reported to the Gestapo and thereafter interned at the Buchenwald concentration camp for a three-month period.
* &quot;Arbeitsschlacht&quot; (&#x27;battle for work&#x27;) – propaganda term for the totality of measures involved in work creation. Because of its military and activist sound, &quot;Arbeitsschlacht&quot; was one of Hitler&#x27;s favorite terms until 1937 (the &quot;de facto&quot; end of unemployment). It was patterned after the Fascist Italian &quot;battaglia per il grano&quot; (&#x27;battle for grain&#x27;).

* &quot;Asoziale&quot; (&#x27;asocial people&#x27;) – during the Nazi era, the term was derogatory, akin to &quot;scum&quot; or the &quot;ballastexistenzen&quot; (&#x27;ballast-existences&#x27; – dead weight, waste-lives) of the socially marginalized, those considered by the Nazis to be undesirables. It included the homeless, migrant workers, beggars, vagrants, large families from the lower social strata, families from the edge of town, &quot;like gypsy&quot; migrants, the so-called &quot;work shy&quot;, alcoholics, prostitutes and pimps. Gypsies (as they were called by the Nazis) were considered to be &quot;foreign race &quot;asoziale&quot;&quot;.
* &quot;Aufbruch der Nation&quot; (&#x27;a new start for the nation&#x27;) – nationalist interpretation of the beginning of the First World War; it was adopted by the &quot;National Socialist Revolution&quot; to emphasize the overcoming of the party state and of pluralism. This was a parallel concept to the National Rising (&quot;Erhebung&quot;).
* &quot;Aufsichtsverwaltung&quot; – supervisory administration&#x27;
* Auschwitz – a town near Kraków in southern Poland that was the site of the largest Nazi concentration camps.
* &quot;ausgebombt&quot; (&#x27;bombed out&#x27;) – people rendered homeless due to the Allied bombing campaign against Germany during World War II.
* &quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot; (&#x27;Germans in foreign countries&#x27;) – people of Germanic blood who spent their formative years in a German community abroad.

* &quot;Ausrichtung&quot; (&#x27;alignment&#x27;) – a favorite NS word, borrowed from military usage, for external and internal &quot;normalization&quot; of the movement&#x27;s followers. External uniformity of dress corresponded to inner ideological alignment regarding NS goals.

* &quot;Außenpolitisches Amt&quot; (APA; &#x27;Foreign Policy Office&#x27;) – a NSDAP foreign policy office overseen by Alfred Rosenberg.
* &quot;Außenstelle&quot; – also known as &quot;Außendienststelle&quot;; outstation or outpost of the SiPo and SD.
* &quot;Autobahn&quot; – The &quot;autobahns&quot;, a freeway system planned and started by the Weimar Republic but constructed by Nazi Germany. The autobahn construction program was enthusiastically implemented by Hitler as a public works project to help fulfill his promise to reduce unemployment. The autobahn system was used as a model for the construction of the United States Interstate Highway System by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who remarked on the efficiency of the autobahn for military transportation while in Germany as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force.

* &quot;Bann, ban&quot; – Old German word meaning &quot;area of command authority&quot; (thus, ban-mile). It was revived by the Hitler Youth to designate a division of four to six &quot;Stämme&quot; (stems), or subbans, led by an HJ &quot;Bannführer&quot;. The &quot;Bann&quot; corresponded to the &quot;Untergau&quot; in the League of German Girls, and to the &quot;Jungbann&quot; in the Jungvolk.
* &quot;Bayreuther Festspiele&quot; – The &quot;Bayreuth Festival&quot;, a festival of Wagnerian opera held since 1876 (and still held today) in Bayreuth, Germany.

* &quot;Ich klage an&quot; (I accuse) – German film (1941) based on the novel, &quot;Sendung und Gewissen&quot; (Mission and Conscience) by Hellmuth Unger, which served to justify euthanasia.

Hitler decried the dangers of internationalism and its humanitarian and egalitarian nature as antithetical to the Nazi ideals and instead, fought against internationalism since for him, internationalism was a tool of Jewish bankers and Marxian Socialists, who were otherwise stateless people and for whom, their power culminated in this international abstraction.

* &quot;Volkssturm&quot; – (People&#x27;s Army), formed in October 1944, the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; was a last ditch effort of the Nazis to call all men (aged 16 to 60 years old) to fight against the invading Allied forces in the final stages of the war. Poorly armed and inadequately equipped, the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; answered not to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; leadership but instead to Himmler in his capacity as the commander of the Reserve Army. Primarily engaged against the Red Army along Germany&#x27;s eastern corridor, over 175,000 members of this ragtag military auxiliary were killed in action. Historian Martin Kitchen describes the establishment of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; as a &quot;pathetic affair.&quot; Against the advancing Russian, Canadian, American, and British forces, members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; (mainly young and old men, with little training) were expected to use handheld anti-tank weapons and small arms in the fight alongside the remaining &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers in repulsing the onslaught. Even if they were to prove unsuccessful, the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; was to set a shining example to future generations by fighting to the &#x27;last man and the last bullet&#x27; for the &quot;Fatherland&quot;; as if these efforts would somehow expunge the surrender of 1918.

<doc id="812801" wikidata="Q1252895" url="?curid=812801" title="Dover (band)">
<text>Dover was a Spanish rock band founded in Madrid in 1992. The group was composed of the sisters and group leaders Cristina Llanos (vocals) and Amparo Llanos (lead guitarist), drummer Jesús Antúnez and bassist Samuel Titos. They recorded eight albums, selling around two million copies. They are known for their second album &quot;Devil Came to Me&quot;, which led them to international fame. In 2006, their sixth album, &quot;Follow the City Lights&quot; caused controversy as the style of the group changed from alternative rock to electronic pop. The band won, among other things, the revelation group awards at the 1997 Premios Ondas and the award for best Spanish artist at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards. The band was disbanded in 2016 by Amparo Llanos, who has since begun another project without her sister.

==Band history==
=== Beginnings and &quot;Sister&quot; ===

Dover originated outside Madrid, in the town of Boadilla del Monte, in the early 90s when Cristina Llanos, then 17, decided to form a rock band encouraged by the alternative scene from Seattle, Washington. The group&#x27;s name was inspired by a brand of a clothing store that her mother owned in Majadahonda. Her sister Amparo, 10 years her senior, joined the project. In 1994, drummer Jesús Antúnez and bassist Álvaro Gómez joined the band. One of the demo tapes of the group went to the radio show Disco Grande on RNE Radio 3. The band then signed a one-year contract with the small independent label Everlasting-Caroline. Their debut album &quot;Sister&quot;, was released in 1995 and the Spanish music fanzine &quot;Mondo Sonoro&quot; included the album among their national Top 10 of the Year. Despite the limited success in terms of album sales, this helped Dover manage to gain a foothold in the music scene in Madrid; they even recorded their first music video &quot;Come With Me&quot; by Juan Bullón, but this song was not released as a single properly, though it was the most demanded for at concerts by fans.

=== Breakthrough: &quot;Devil Came to Me&quot; ===
The contract with Everlasting-Caroline only lasted a year and afterwards the band signed with the independent label Subterfuge Records. Their first involvement with the label was to include a demo version of their song &quot;Loli Jackson&quot; in the multi-band compilation album &quot;Stereoparty 2&quot;. This success motivated the label to produce their second album and so they entered the Infinity Studios in Madrid in 1997 to record the album &quot;Devil Came to Me&quot; on a tight budget of 80,000 pesetas and in just 20 days. The album was released on 21 April 1997, a fragment of the album&#x27;s title track (specifically the chorus with the phrase &quot;I lied for you, I lied for you...&quot;) was included in a popular television commercial by Radical Fruit Company which increased their notoriety and the band was launched to national fame. During the promotion of this album, Álvaro Gómez was replaced by Álvaro Díez in 1997. The album sold over 500,000 copies and gained them fans abroad in Europe and the United States. They released their official first single from the album, &quot;Serenade&quot;, a song that, thanks to its strong chorus and catchy melody, managed to become their first number one in Spain. Juan Bullón again directed their next music video. The song &quot;Loli Jackson&quot; is featured by director Daniel Calparsoro in the 1997 movie &quot;Blinded&quot;.

=== &quot;Late at Night&quot;, &quot;I Was Dead for 7 Weeks in the City of Angels&quot;, and &quot;The Flame&quot; ===
The relationship with Subterfuge Records deteriorated and they signed with Chrysalis Records label owned by EMI Music. In 1998 they created their own label, Loli Jackson Records, and had soon signed up several independent groups. The following year they released their third album &quot;Late at Night&quot;, recorded in Seattle with Barret Jones. It was released on 28 June of that year with great expectations created by its first single, &quot;DJ&quot;, a number one in Spain - something totally new for a rock band. This success led to their first international tour, taking in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Mexico and the United States among others. By February 2000, the album was already triple platinum with 300,000 copies sold in Spain alone.

In 2000, Dover received an award from MTV Europe for Best Spanish Artist. In 2001, Chrysalis reissued their first album &quot;Sister&quot; including the unreleased song &quot;Noche Tras Noche&quot;, a cover of a song by the Spanish band Solera. In May of that year they entered Grandmasters Studies Recorder to record their new album, produced by themselves with Barrett Jones. The first single, &quot;King George&quot;, was released on 3 September. The album itself, titled &quot;I Was Dead for 7 Weeks in the City of Angels&quot;, was released on 17 September 2001 and in just ten days had sold 125,000 copies.

In 2003, the musical crisis forced them to close their record company and sign with EMI Music. On 27 October their fifth album, &quot;The Flame&quot;, was released. This time the album was co-produced by Rick Will and recorded entirely in Spain. Sales were not in their favour this time and struggled to reach 60,000 copies.
In May 2005, bassist Álvaro Díez was fired from the group and replaced by Samuel Titos, former guitarist and vocalist of Sperm. In late 2005 they become the first group to support the NGO Oxfam.

=== Pop reinvention: &quot;Follow the City Lights&quot; ===

For months, the group begins to compose what would be their new album. Dover announced that it would be a change that would leave everyone pleasantly surprised. And so in October 2006 they released a new album called &quot;Follow the City Lights&quot;, produced by Daniel Alcover. Dover&#x27;s style changed radically, introducing electronic arrangements in their music.

The first single from this album, &quot;Let Me Out&quot;, received a Premio Ondas for Best Song in 2006. Also, the single reached number 1 on the Spanish charts Los 40 Principales for four weeks. Furthermore, &quot;Let Me Out&quot; soon became number one on the Spanish iTunes Music Store. The second single from the album was &quot;Do Ya&quot;, which was featured in the football video game &quot;FIFA 08&quot;. A third single, &quot;Keep On Moving&quot;, was also released from the album. Each single had an accompanying music video.

In November 2007 they released their first double disc compilation of Dover, titled &quot;2&quot;, which contained many of the successful singles and tracks released by Dover, including a new song called &quot;Soldier&quot;. The same year they toured with La Oreja de Van Gogh.

In late 2008, Dover toured throughout Germany and Europe to promote &quot;2&quot;. In March 2009 they subsequently signed a contract with Sony-BMG. In several interviews they announced that their forthcoming seventh album would come out in 2010.

===African rhythms: &quot;I Ka Kené&quot;===

On 31 July 2010, Dover released the first single from their upcoming album &quot;I Ka Kené&quot; on YouTube, &quot;Dannayá&quot;. It is sung in the African language Bambara and English. According to the band&#x27;s Facebook page, the single is inspired by a Malian immigrant they met. The album &quot;I Ka Kené&quot; was later released on 4 October 2010 and it shows the multilingual side of Dover as the entire album was sung in French, Bambara and English

===2012: &quot;What Goes Around Comes Around&quot;===
During the first quarter of 2012, Dover announced the release of a single with two songs, an unreleased track and a cover of a popular song of the eighties; the unreleased track was mixed by Veronica Ferraro in France and the cover by Jesús Antúnez in Madrid. On 8 March 2012, a fan revealed the title of the new song &quot;What Goes Around Comes Around&quot; on the internet. The b-side to &quot;What Goes Around Comes Around&quot; was a cover of &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, which was a hit for INXS in 1987.

Dover took part in the Trina promotional campaign &quot;Al natural&quot;, performing three songs: &quot;Loli Jackson&quot;, &quot;King George&quot; and &quot;Junnete&quot;, playing three acoustic versions. They were also involved in the introduction of a Givenchy perfume, giving them the opportunity to make their first online live performance, performing &quot;The Hitter&quot;, &quot;The Morning After&quot;, &quot;King George&quot;, &quot;Do Ya&quot; and a new version of &quot;DJ&quot; accompanied only by an electric guitar.

The release of &quot;What Goes Around Comes Around&quot; was delayed for fifteen days, and was only sold in digital form at the end of June 2012. The promotion was limited to a single appearance on the program &quot;El Número Uno&quot;. The single entered the list of Los 40 Principales and spent five weeks on the chart. They began their tour in 2012 reviewing their greatest hits, such as the original versions of &quot;Devil Came to Me&quot;, &quot;King George&quot; and &quot;Serenade&quot;, in addition to an acoustic version of &quot;Loli Jackson&quot;.

===2013 - 2016: The return to rock: &quot;Dover Came to Me&quot; tour, &quot;Complications&quot; and split===

In 2014, Dover announced that, to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of foundation of the band, they would tour and re-release their &quot;Devil Came to Me&quot; album (as they also were celebrating the 15th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release). The tour started on 8 March in the Sala Sol in Madrid. Tickets sold out more than three months before the concert. From that date, they began to perform in multiple venues in Spain, selling out most performances.. They also reissued their album &quot;Devil Came to Me&quot;, called &quot;Dover Came to Me&quot;, in different formats. The Deluxe format contains a CD with a remastered album version plus bonus tracks, a second CD with their live songs and a DVD with one of the concerts of this tour, plus a 1997 live performance in the Palacio de los Deportes. Also the DVD includes interviews with the band members, plus two video clips: &quot;Serenade&quot; and &quot;Loli Jackson&quot;.

After filling more than thirty-five concert halls throughout Spain during 2013, they embarked on a final tour that winter, which would come to an end in the legendary hall La Riviera on 10 January 2014. The rest of the year, they only performed on a couple occasions, one of which was holding Subterfuge in the Music Day in June, where they presented a new untitled song, later to be called &quot;Crash&quot;. Their social networks were updated with news about recording a new album, indicating that it would be closer to rock.

In September they premiered &quot;Too Late&quot; during a concert in La Rioja. In December, &quot;Complications&quot;, their eighth studio album, was announced; it was released on 9 February. Produced by drummer Jesús Antúnez and recorded in Madrid, &quot;Complications&quot; returned to the melodic rock that characterized Dover&#x27;s early albums.

In November 2016, Amparo Llanos announced on Radio 3 that the band was breaking up, with herself and bassist Samuel Titos starting another band named New Day, while drummer Jesús Antúnez would focus on his DJ career.

==Band influences==
Despite Dover being a Spanish band, most of their songs are written in English (except for &quot;Noche Tras Noche&quot;, a cover a song by the band Solera which was included as a bonus track on the reissue of their album &quot;Sister&quot; in 2001) and are composed by the Llanos sisters. Amparo composing and Cristina writing the lyrics.

According to the group, the reason that the lyrics are in English is because their rock influences have always been primarily English bands and they do not feel comfortable using Spanish lyrics for their songs.

Both sisters insist they were strongly influenced by The Beatles and grunge music, especially Nirvana. These influences are evident in the music. Thus, referring to Paul McCartney in &quot;King George&quot; (&quot;I need to McCartney&#x27;s song&quot;). In &quot;27 Years&quot;, they make reference to a famous album of his: &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, and in their album &quot;Follow the City Lights&quot;, one of the songs which is called &quot;Dear McCartney&quot;. In this album, they have said that their influences have been artists like Madonna and Peaches. Also, their song &quot;The Weak Hour of the Rooster&quot; quotes the last sentence from the suicide note of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana: &quot;It&#x27;s better to burn out than to fade away&quot;.

As for the album &quot;I Ka Kené&quot;, they were influenced by African artists like Boubacar Traore, Korchach, Coumba Sidibe, John Chivadura, Nahawa Dumbia, Oliver Mtukudzi, Habib Koite, Sekouba Traore, Bembeya Jazz Orchestra, Sekouba Bambino, etc. In addition to the incorporation of lyrics in Bambara, a national language of Mali, the album features lyrics in French, which is widely spoken in Africa.

As for the album &quot;Complications&quot;, Cristina commented that the biggest influence for the album was The Cars and Joan Jett.

<text>Titus Desticius Juba was a Roman governor of Britain between 253 and 258. Anthony Birley writes that Desticius Juba &quot;is the latest known instance of a consular governor of Upper Britain, and indeed of any consular governor with senatorial legates and legions under him.&quot;

Desticius Juba likely had his origins at Concordia in northern Italy, where numerous inscriptions have been found attesting to &quot;Desticii, with the &quot;praenomen&quot; Titus, and several with the &quot;cognomen&quot; Juba&quot;. He had served in Rome as suffect consul and some time later was posted to Britannia Superior. The barracks at Caerleon were refurbished under his governorship between the years 253 and 255.

<doc id="812818" wikidata="Q1305455" url="?curid=812818" title="In a Lonely Place">
<text>In a Lonely Place is a 1950 American film noir directed by Nicholas Ray and starring Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame, produced for Bogart&#x27;s Santana Productions. The script was written by Andrew P. Solt from Edmund H. North&#x27;s adaptation of Dorothy B. Hughes&#x27; 1947 novel of the same name.

Bogart stars as Dixon (Dix) Steele, a troubled, violence-prone screenwriter suspected of murder. Grahame co-stars as Laurel Gray, a lonely neighbor who falls under his spell. Beyond its surface plot of confused identity and tormented love, the story is a mordant comment on Hollywood mores and the pitfalls of celebrity and near-celebrity, similar to two other American films released that same year, Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

Although less famous than his other work, Bogart&#x27;s performance is considered by many critics to be among his finest and the film&#x27;s reputation has grown over time, along with Ray&#x27;s. It is now considered one of the best films noir of all time, as evidenced by its inclusion on the &quot;Time&quot; &quot;All-Time 100 Movies&quot; list and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s &quot;100 Essential Films&quot;, and it is ranked number one on &quot;Slant&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The 100 Best Film Noirs of All Time&quot;. The BBC ranked it number 89 in their list of the 100 greatest American films of all time. In 2007, &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Dixon &quot;Dix&quot; Steele is a down-on-his-luck Hollywood screenwriter who has not had a successful movie since before World War II. While driving to meet his agent, Mel Lippman, Dix&#x27;s explosive temper is revealed when, at a stoplight, he engages with another motorist in a confrontation that almost becomes violent. Meeting with Mel at a nightclub, Dix is cajoled into adapting a book for a movie. The hat-check girl, Mildred Atkinson, is engrossed in reading the copy meant for Dix; since she only has a few pages left to go, she asks to be allowed to finish it. Dix claims to be too tired to read the novel, so he asks Mildred to go home with him to explain the plot. As they enter the courtyard of his apartment, they pass a new tenant, Laurel Gray. Mildred describes the story, confirming what Dix had suspected—the book is no good. Rather than drive her home as promised, he gives her cab fare instead.

The next morning, Dix is awakened by his friend, police detective Brub Nicolai, who served under Dix during the war. Nicolai takes him downtown to be questioned by his superior, Captain Lochner, who reveals that Mildred was murdered and informs Dix that he is a suspect. Dix remembers that Laurel saw him letting Mildred out of his apartment, which Laurel confirms when brought in for questioning. Afterwards Dix strikes up conversation with Laurel and their mutual attraction is evident. When he gets home, Dix checks up on Laurel. He finds she is an aspiring actress with only a few low-budget films to her credit. They begin to fall in love and, with Laurel assisting him, Dix enthusiastically goes back to work, much to Mel&#x27;s delight.

At a dinner with Nicolai and his wife, Sylvia, Dix has them re-enact the murder as he imagines it; his odd behavior leads Sylvia to doubt his innocence. Captain Lochner meets with Laurel again and sows seeds of doubt in her mind, as he has fixated on Dix&#x27;s record of violent behavior. Laurel confides in Sylvia her growing doubts about Dix.

At a nightclub with Laurel, Dix spots Ted Barton, another detective, arriving with a female companion. Dix angrily leaves, believing that Barton is tailing him. Later, Laurel&#x27;s masseuse Martha warns her about Dix&#x27;s chequered romantic past, and Laurel grows irritated, kicking her out of the apartment. At a beach party with the Nicolais, Sylvia inadvertently reveals Laurel&#x27;s follow-up meeting with Lochner; Dix furiously storms off. Laurel follows and gets into Dix&#x27;s car; he drives erratically and at speed until they sideswipe another car. Nobody is hurt, but when the other driver accosts him, Dix beats him unconscious and is about to strike him with a large rock when Laurel stops him.

Dix goes to the police station and attempts to clear his name, inadvertently meeting Mildred&#x27;s boyfriend Henry Kesler, who works at a bank. Dix remarks to Nicolai that Kesler is a better suspect as he has a motive. At the Nicolai residence, Laurel asks Sylvia about Dix prompting the Nicolais to re-enact the murder, and tells her about Dix&#x27;s roadside assault.

Eventually, Laurel&#x27;s doubts about Dix&#x27;s innocence result in her being unable to sleep without taking pills. When he asks her to marry him, she accepts, but only because she is scared of how he might react if she refuses. Mel comes over to celebrate while Dix is away, only to find out that Laurel does not want to go through with the marriage and is making plans to escape to New York. She urges Mel to bring Dix&#x27;s completed script to a producer.

At a dinner to celebrate the engagement, Dix is annoyed to learn that Mel has submitted his script without his consent. Dix then intercepts a telephone call meant for Laurel at the table, angrily discovering it is Martha and slugging Mel when he tries to intervene.

Back at Laurel&#x27;s apartment, Dix flies into a rage when he sees that she has removed her engagement ring. After briefly calming down, Dix answers the phone, learning of Laurel&#x27;s intended flight to New York. He again becomes violent, almost strangling Laurel before regaining control of himself when the phone rings again. It is Nicolai, who informs Dix and Laurel that Kesler has confessed to Mildred&#x27;s murder, with Lochner apologizing for fixating on Dix. However, both Dix and Laurel realise that it is too late to salvage their relationship. Laurel watches in tears as Dix slowly walks away across the courtyard to his apartment.

==Background==
When Edmund H. North adapted the story, he stuck close to the original source and John Derek was considered for the role of Steele because in the novel the character was much younger. North&#x27;s treatment was not used.

Andrew Solt developed the screenplay with regular input from producer Robert Lord and director Nicholas Ray, and the result is far different from the source novel. Solt claimed that Bogart loved the script so much that he wanted to make it without revisions – Solt maintains that the final cut is very close to his script – but further research shows that Ray made regular rewrites, some added on the day of shooting. In fact, only four pages of the 140-page script had no revisions. The film was produced by Bogart&#x27;s Santana Productions company, whose first film was &quot;Knock on Any Door&quot; (1949), which was directed by Ray and starred Bogart and Derek in the leading roles.

Louise Brooks wrote in her essay &quot;Humphrey and Bogey&quot; that she felt it was the role of Dixon Steele in this movie that came closest to the real Bogart she knew.

Before inertia set in, he played one fascinatingly complex character, craftily directed by Nicholas Ray, in a film whose title perfectly defined Humphrey&#x27;s own isolation among people. &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; gave him a role that he could play with complexity because the character&#x27;s pride in his art, his selfishness, his drunkenness, his lack of energy stabbed with lightning strokes of violence, were shared equally by the real Bogart.
The original ending had Steele strangling Gray to death in the heat of their argument. Sgt. Nicolai comes to tell Steele that he has been cleared of Mildred&#x27;s murder but arrests him for killing Gray. Steele tells Brub that he is finally finished with his screenplay; the final shot was to be of a page in the typewriter which has the significant lines Steele said to Gray in the car (which he admitted to not knowing where to put) &quot;I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks while she loved me&quot;. This scene was filmed halfway through the shooting schedule, but Ray hated the ending he had helped write. Ray later said, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t believe the ending that Bundy (screenwriter Andrew Solt) and I had written. I shot it because it was my obligation to do it. Then I kicked everybody off stage except Bogart, Art Smith and Gloria. And we improvised the ending as it is now. In the original ending we had ribbons so it was all tied up into a very neat package, with Lovejoy coming in and arresting him as he was writing the last lines, having killed Gloria. Huh! And I thought, shit, I can&#x27;t do it, I just can&#x27;t do it! Romances don&#x27;t have to end that way. Marriages don&#x27;t have to end that way, they don&#x27;t have to end in violence. Let the audience make up its own mind what&#x27;s going to happen to Bogie when he goes outside the apartment.&quot;

Bacall and Ginger Rogers were considered for the role of Laurel Gray. Bacall was a natural choice given her off-screen marriage to Bogart and their box-office appeal, but Warner Bros. refused to loan her out, a move often thought to be in reaction to Bogart having set up his own independent production company, the type of which Warner Bros. were afraid would jeopardize the future of the major studios. Rogers was the producers&#x27; first choice but Ray believed that his wife Gloria Grahame was right for the part. Even though their marriage was troubled, he insisted that she be cast. Her performance today is unanimously considered to be among her finest.

Grahame and Ray&#x27;s marriage was starting to come apart during filming. Grahame was forced to sign a contract stipulating that &quot;my husband [Ray] shall be entitled to direct, control, advise, instruct and even command my actions during the hours from 9 AM to 6 PM, every day except Sunday ... I acknowledge that in every conceivable situation his will and judgment shall be considered superior to mine and shall prevail.&quot; Grahame was also forbidden to &quot;nag, cajole, tease or in any other feminine fashion seek to distract or influence him.&quot; The two did separate during filming. Afraid that one of them would be replaced, Ray took to sleeping in a dressing room, lying and saying that he needed to work on the script. Grahame played along with the charade and nobody knew that they had separated. Though there was a brief reconciliation, the couple divorced in 1952.

The film was one of two Nicholas Ray films to be scored by avant garde classical composer George Antheil (1900–1959). The production began on October 25, 1949, and ended on December 1, 1949.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
At the time of its original release, the reviews were generally positive (in particular many critics praised Bogart and Grahame&#x27;s performances), but many questioned the marketability given the bleak ending. The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in May 1950 gave the film a good review and wrote,

In &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; Humphrey Bogart has a sympathetic role though cast as one always ready to mix it with his dukes. He favors the underdog; in one instance he virtually has a veteran, brandy-soaking character actor (out of work) on his very limited payroll ... Director Nicholas Ray maintains nice suspense. Bogart is excellent. Gloria Grahame, as his romance, also rates kudos.

Bosley Crowther lauded the film, especially Bogart&#x27;s performance and the screenplay, writing, 

Everybody should be happy this morning. Humphrey Bogart is in top form in his latest independently made production, &quot;In a Lonely Place,&quot; and the picture itself is a superior cut of melodrama. Playing a violent, quick-tempered Hollywood movie writer suspected of murder, Mr. Bogart looms large on the screen of the Paramount Theatre and he moves flawlessly through a script which is almost as flinty as the actor himself. Andrew Solt, who fashioned the screenplay from a story by Dorothy B. Hughes and an adaptation by Edmund H. North, has had the good sense to resolve the story logically. Thus Dixon Steele remains as much of an enigma, an explosive, contradictory force at loose ends when the film ends as when it starts.

Not unlike Ray&#x27;s debut &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1948), it was advertised as a straight thriller although the film does not fit easily into one genre, as the marketing shows. Ray&#x27;s films had a brief revival in the 1970s and Bogart&#x27;s anti-hero stance gained a following in the 1960s, and the French &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; critics during the 1950s praised Ray&#x27;s unique film making. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which gave the film a negative review upon its initial release, called it one of the 100 best films of all time in their 2005 list.

Critic Ed Gonzalez wrote in 2001, &quot;Not unlike Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Nicholas Ray&#x27;s remarkable &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; represents the purest of existentialist primers ... Gray and Dixon may love each other but it&#x27;s evident that they&#x27;re both entirely too victimized by their own selves to sustain this kind of happiness. In the end, their love resembles a rehearsal for the next and hopefully less complicated romance. This is the existential endgame of one of Ray&#x27;s smartest and most devastating masterpieces.&quot;

Curtis Hanson is featured on the retrospective documentary of the DVD release showing his admiration for the film, notably Ray&#x27;s direction, the dark depiction of Hollywood and Bogart&#x27;s performance. This was one of the films which he showed to actors Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce in preparation for filming &quot;L.A. Confidential.&quot; He said, &quot;I wanted them to see the reality of that period and to see that emotion. This movie, and I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the greatest movie ever made, but it represents many things that I think are worth aspiring to, such as having character and emotion be the driving force, rather than the plot. ... When I first saw &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; as a teenager, it frightened me and yet attracted me with an almost hypnotic power. Later, I came to understand why. Occasionally, very rarely, a movie feels so heartfelt, so emotional, so revealing that it seems as though both the actor and the director are standing naked before the audience. When that kind of marriage happens between actor and director, it&#x27;s breathtaking.&quot;

In 2009, film critic Roger Ebert added &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; to his &quot;great movies&quot; list.

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96% of critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10, based on 49 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Led by extraordinary performances from Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame, &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; is a gripping noir of uncommon depth and maturity.&quot;

===In popular culture===
The 1986 song &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; by the Smithereens, from the album &quot;Especially For You&quot;, was inspired by the film. Its chorus, &quot;I was born the day I met you, lived a while when you loved me, died a little when we broke apart,&quot; is taken directly from the movie&#x27;s dialogue.

In Season 2, Episode 1 of the TV show &quot;Frasier&quot; (1994), an author reads from his book lines echoing the film&#x27;s: &quot;I budded when you kissed me. I withered when you left me. I bloomed a few months while you loved me.&quot;

==Comparisons to novel==
&quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; was based on the 1947 novel of the same name by Dorothy B. Hughes. Some controversy exists between admirers of the film and admirers of the novel (who view the film as a watered down adaptation), as Edmund H. North&#x27;s script takes some elements of the novel but is ultimately a different story. Hughes was not bothered by the changes made by North and praised Grahame&#x27;s performance as Gray.

The strongest difference between the two works lies in the protagonist; the film&#x27;s Dixon Steele is a screenwriter with an unconventional life and a decent person with fatally poor impulse control, prone to wild overreaction when enraged. The novel&#x27;s Steele is a limited third-person view from Steele&#x27;s perspective, reminiscent of the first-person in noir, à la &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;. Steele is a charlatan who pretends to be a novelist while sponging money from his overbearing uncle. While still receiving what he perceives as a small monthly allowance from his uncle, Steele murders a wealthy young man and assumes his identity, in a manner similar to Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s later Tom Ripley. The film follows the question of whether Steele finally went too far in his anger and committed the murder to a tragic end. Even though he is proved innocent, his rage at the cloud of suspicion has driven the woman he loves away for good. No question of Steele&#x27;s innocence exists in the novel, which follows the investigation of a murder Steele plainly committed and his interference in the investigation for his own ends.

Curtis Hanson, in the DVD featurette &#x27;In A Lonely Place Revisited&#x27;, further analyses the similarities and differences between the novel and the film. He notes that there is a parallel in the film between Steele&#x27;s adaptation of a novel for film and the adaptation of &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; for film. He also notes that a difference between Steele in the film and Steele in the novel is their respective treatment of women. In the novel Steele pursues women and the first chapter details his pursuit of a woman. In the film, Steele is pursued by women.

Hughes&#x27; novel was out of print for decades, until re-released by The Feminist Press at CUNY in 2003, which edition was still in print in 2010. Penguin Books published a paperback edition in the UK in 2010 as part of their Modern Classics imprint, and the Library of America included it in the first volume of their &quot;Women Crime Writers&quot; collection. Second-hand copies are readily available.

<text>Open Bible Churches (OBC), formerly known as Open Bible Standard Churches (OBSC), is an association of Finished Work Pentecostal churches with headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, United States. Open Bible is similar in doctrine and practice to the Assemblies of God in that the adherents believe in the modern-day gifts of the Holy Spirit, with speaking in tongues as one of the evidences of the gifts being manifested in the believer. Generally, each congregation owns its own property and calls its own pastor. The organization is affiliated with the National Association of Evangelicals and the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America. Open Bible Churches is affiliated with New Hope Christian College, an accredited Bible college in Eugene, Oregon, INSTE Bible College in Ankeny, Iowa, Harvest Bible College, located at First Church of the Open Bible in Des Moines, Iowa, and Toledo School of Ministry in Toledo, Ohio. Open Bible publishes the &quot;Message of the Open Bible&quot;. There are more than 150,000 Open Bible members worldwide. In 2006, U.S. membership was 40,000 in 330 churches. In 2010, US membership had dropped to 22,659 members in 261 churches.

==History==
The OBSC&#x27;s origins are found in two smaller Pentecostal groups which can be traced to the Azusa Street Revival: the Bible Standard Conference founded in Eugene, Oregon in 1919 and the Open Bible Evangelistic Association founded in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1932; as both were similar in doctrine and structure, the two groups amalgamated in 1935. The Bible Standard Conference was formed in 1919 after Fred Hornshuh and several other ministers withdrew from the Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) led by Florence L. Crawford. Hornshuh disagreed with the AFM&#x27;s isolationist stance from other full gospel groups, centralized and authoritarian leadership style, and its strict position on divorce and remarriage. The Open Bible Evangelistic Association began in 1932 when thirty-two ministers led by John R. and Louise H. Richey left the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. The separation grew out of the reluctance of these ministers to give ownership of local church property to the Foursquare Church denominational leadership. They were also concerned over the church&#x27;s divorced leader Aimee Semple McPherson&#x27;s remarriage. The two Pentecostal groups were similar in their resistance to authoritarian leadership and denominational ownership of church property, and they also thought that local churches should maintain some autonomy. Since 1996, the organization&#x27;s public name has been simply Open Bible Churches.

<doc id="812932" wikidata="Q1929413" url="?curid=812932" title="The Chronicles of Life and Death">
<text>The Chronicles of Life and Death is the third studio album by American rock band Good Charlotte. Following the release of &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; (2002), the group spent two years touring. By the second half of 2003, they had begun writing for the next album. With producer Eric Valentine, the band recorded at Barefoot Studios in Hollywood, California, between March and June 2004. Over half of the album&#x27;s material was written by Benji and Joel Madden, with the remainder being co-written with Valentine, Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann or guitarist Billy Martin. Preceded by the single release of &quot;Predictable&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; was released through Epic and Daylight Records on October 5, 2004. Two variations were made available: &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Death&quot; versions which came with different cover artwork (designed by Martin) and a different bonus track.

Drummer Chris Wilson was in therapy and sat out the initial promotional appearances around the album&#x27;s release; Alkaline Trio drummer Derek Grant filled in for him temporarily during the group&#x27;s co-headlining US tour with Sum 41. In early 2005, &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; was released as a single and tours of Japan, New Zealand, Australia and Europe followed. The band co-headlined the Noise to the World Tour with Simple Plan in May and June, which coincided with the single release of the album&#x27;s title-track. Wilson left the group a few shows into the trek, and was replaced by Dean Butterworth. &quot;We Believe&quot; was released as a single in August, which coincided with a series of European festival appearances.

&quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; received a generally mixed reception from music critics with some finding the lyrics lacking depth and others praising the instrumentation and darker tone. Nevertheless, the record sold 199,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest debut on the chart. It was eventually certified platinum, and as of February 2007, sales stood at 1.1 million copies. The album was also successful outside of the US. It charted at number one in Australia, reached the top 10 in Canada, Japan and the UK, as well as the top 20 in Austria, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy and Switzerland. Within these territories, the album was certified platinum in Australia, and gold in Austria, Germany and the UK. &quot;Predictable&quot; and &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; appeared on US radio charts and reached the top 40 in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the UK.

==Background and production==
Good Charlotte released their second album, &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot;, in October 2002. Three of the album&#x27;s singles—&quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot;, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, and &quot;The Anthem&quot;—shifted the group from modern rock to mainstream top 40 radio. As a result, &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; debuted in the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, having sold 117,000 copies in its first week of release. It eventually sold over three million copies in the US. Following its release, the band spent the next two years touring, which included two US arena tours. In August 2003, the group began assembling songs for their next album. They planned to write while on tour between September and November, and were expected to start recording after it ended.

In January 2004, the group embarked on a tour of Japan. Their label Epic/Daylight Records told the band they would be going into the studio to record shortly after the tour ended. On hearing this, vocalist Joel Madden was unsure what to write about saying, &quot;We were just in this whirlwind bubble.&quot; He flew back to the US and travelled from his home in San Francisco to Los Angeles. Recording for their next album took place at Barefoot Studios in Hollywood, California. Eric Valentine was the producer and engineer assisted by Trevor Whatever and Chris Roach.

The group entered the studio with 16–18 songs. Recording sessions began in March and ended in June. Matt Radosevich handled the editing, programming, additional engineering and played piano on &quot;The Truth&quot;. The strings conduction and arrangements were done by David Campbell, along with Valentine on the latter composition. Michele Ito and Chikako Horii sang on &quot;Once Upon a Time: The Battle of Life and Death&quot;. John Feldmann tracked additional guitars for &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot;. Valentine mixed and mastered the recordings, except for &quot;Meet My Maker&quot;, which was mixed by Jacquire King with assistance from Andy Hunt.

==Composition==
The group faced &quot;a lot of criticism from all sides&quot; and felt out of place in the current pop scene and the pop punk genre they had come from. The band&#x27;s members internalised this while they made the album; Joel Madden said they were &quot;ready to move on and make a statement&quot;, wanting to do &quot;something grand.&quot; Their label wanted a more marketable release, however, the band rebelled by going in a dark and moody direction with some sarcastic moments on &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot;. With a lot of pressure to come up with another hit single, the band opted to go as dark as they could. The resulting album was &quot;a cohesive record&quot; that dealt with the members&#x27; thoughts about their &quot;own mortality in the emotional, physical and musical sense.&quot; A conscious effort was made to focus on mortality, as well as life and death; hope serves as recurring theme throughout the album. Musically, the album has been classified as pop punk, with elements of British punk rock, emo, arena rock, goth rock, hip-hop, new wave and rock opera.

Michael Odell of &quot;Blender&quot; described &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; as a concept album that &quot;span[s] the outer reaches of [Good Charlotte&#x27;s] topsy-turvy philosophical world&quot;. Half of the album was written by Benji and Joel Madden, while they co-wrote the remaining tracks with Valentine, Feldmann or guitarist Billy Martin. Piano and string instruments appear throughout the album. The opening track &quot;Once Upon a Time: The Battle of Life and Death&quot; is an instrumental featuring strings and a Japanese choir. The track, along with the ending of &quot;In This World (Murder)&quot;, represents the cycle of life and death. The title track opens with the beeping sound of a heart-rate monitor before Joel Madden&#x27;s vocal begins over a power pop groove in the style of the Kinks. &quot;Walk Away (Maybe)&quot; fuses hard rock-edged verses with indie rock-esque strumming patterns. The rock track &quot;S.O.S.&quot; is a suicide note portraying drama.

The dance-rock track &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot;, the album&#x27;s biggest musical departure from the band&#x27;s usual style, combines power chords, string samples and disco beats, with Madden rapping over it in the vein of Nelly. The lyrics talk about celebrity life, refencing &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous&quot; in the process. The new wave &quot;Ghost of You&quot; features synthesizers and strings, and is reminiscent of New Order. &quot;Predictable&quot; starts off with strings before shifting into a spoken-word rant by Madden. &quot;Secrets&quot; comes across as sounding like a Morrissey and Jerry Finn collaboration. The piano ballad &quot;The Truth&quot; is followed by the keyboard and acoustic-driven &quot;The World Is Black&quot;, which was compared to the Cure&#x27;s sound. Madden said &quot;We Believe&quot; sounded like a track that could be sung by Elton John or Billy Joel. He wrote it while watching CNN and was singing about things what were happening in the world. Hidden track &quot;Wounded&quot; is an acoustic track.

==Release==
On August 9 and 10, 2004, the group filmed a video for &quot;Predictable&quot; in Toronto, Canada. Martin said it shows two sides of the group: &quot;There&#x27;s a dark, twisted room where we&#x27;re playing in, where it&#x27;s thunderstorming... [and then] Joel [Madden] goes outside and the sky is perfectly clear and it&#x27;s like a nice neighborhood&quot;. &quot;Predictable&quot; was released to radio on August 24. A behind-the-scenes making-of the song video premiered in early September. &quot;Predictable&quot; was released as a CD single in Australia on September 27 with an acoustic version of &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot;, and live versions of &quot;The Anthem&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; recorded at Abbey Road Studios as B-sides.

&quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; was made available for streaming on October 1 through MTV&#x27;s The Leak. Initially planned for release in September, the album was released on October 5 through Epic and Daylight Records in two different editions: Life (with &quot;Falling Away&quot; as a bonus track) and Death (with &quot;Meet My Maker&quot; as a bonus track), both with different artwork created by Martin. The Target Life edition included a live session version of &quot;The Anthem&quot; as a bonus track. Some independent stores were annoyed at this gimmick and pulled stock for all Epic releases for the two weeks. The Japanese edition featured both &quot;Falling Away&quot; and &quot;Meet My Maker&quot; and a Japanese version of &quot;Predictable&quot; as bonus tracks. The art for the Life version resembles a new book, while the art for the Death version resembles a 100-year-old book. The album booklet is designed in the style of a storybook with the song lyrics telling a story accompanied by illustrations.

A music video for &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; premiered on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on November 16, 2004. Directed by Brett Simon, it features the group performing in a dive bar before the band members return to their day jobs. Eventually, someone from the music industry signs the band, known as the Food Group, who are dressed as different food items. They become the center of attention due a sex tape controversy and a lip-synching disaster. A behind-the-scenes video was released on December 18. &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; was released as a CD single in Australia on January 17, 2005, with live versions of &quot;S.O.S.&quot; and &quot;The World Is Black&quot; as B-sides.

In early April 2005, a music video was filmed for &quot;We Believe&quot; with director Sam Erickson at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The video features the group in an abandoned theatre performing in front of a movie screen showing images of war and people suffering. &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; was released as a CD single in Australia on June 3 and in the UK on June 7 with live versions of &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; and &quot;Mountain&quot;, and a remix of &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; as B-sides. &quot;We Believe&quot; was released as a single on August 15. On November 13, the album was released on the DualDisc format. It included a making-of documentary and live performances. In September 2010, the album was reissued as a two-CD package with &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot;.

==Touring==
In June 2004, the group was due to perform a few shows on the Warped Tour, but these appearances were cancelled and rescheduled in August. During this time, the band headlined Edgefest. Several TV appearances across Europe followed in late September and early October, leading to a performance at AOL Music Live in New York in the same year. During this show, they debuted material from their forthcoming album with Alkaline Trio drummer Derek Grant temporarily substituting for the band&#x27;s Chris Wilson who was undergoing therapy. Grant played with the group for a few more promotional events including an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and in-store performances. In October and November, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Sum 41. They were supported by Lola Ray and Hazen Street.

In February 2005, the band toured Japan, New Zealand and Australia. Later that month, they performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and at MTV&#x27;s TRL Awards, and appeared at MTV Asia&#x27;s tsunami relief event. The group embarked on European and the UK tour in March with support from the Explosion and Millencolin. In May and June, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Simple Plan, dubbed the Noise to the World tour. They were supported by Reliant K. A few dates into the tour, Wilson left the group citing health concerns. He was replaced by Dean Butterworth, who had been introduced to the group by fellow musician John Feldmann. In between dates on this tour, the band headlined a number of shows before going on a tour of Asia in July. The Canadian leg of the Noise to the World tour followed later in July followed by a series of European festivals in August. In October, the band appeared at the Bridge School Benefit and played a few shows in South America in November and December.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; has received generally mixed reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus said Madden&#x27;s &quot;newly developed husky tenor&quot; aids him on the collection&#x27;s &quot;more introspective&quot; tracks, while he manages to &quot;still belt out the rousing punk-pop choruses&quot; on a few tracks. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Keith Caulfield felt the group &quot;takes its proven peppy rock sound to new heights.&quot; Michael Endelman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the record a &quot;giant leap forward&quot; in terms of &quot;instrumental prowess, and in emotional and melodic scope.&quot; E! Online also gave it a positive review, saying: &quot;Pulling off the tricky balancing act of aiming for mainstream success while keeping one&#x27;s street cred intact, songs like &#x27;Ghost of You&#x27; and &#x27;Predictable&#x27; abandon the band&#x27;s mall-rat roots in exchange for more mature influences like U2 and Muse.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; contributor Anthony Miccio called the lyricism &quot;near-perfect&quot; with &quot;blessedly literal expressions of emotion and identity&quot; conveyed by the &quot;unabashed and outrageously catchy songcraft.&quot;

&quot;Spin&quot; writer Joe Gross said the group stretched the feeling of &quot;Hold On&quot; (from &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot;) and applied it across the entirety of &quot;Chronicles&quot;, &quot;reducing the band&#x27;s wide-eyed sadness to overpolished moping.&quot; Elizabeth Bromstein of &quot;Now&quot; viewed the lyrics as &quot;average&quot; and Madden&#x27;s voice as &quot;still sound[ing] whiny&quot;. Jason Heller for &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; said the band &quot;dressing up its stale pop-punk with strings and reverb is like pouring Magic Shell over a dog turd.&quot; IGN&#x27;s JR bluntly called listening to the album &quot;the most painful thing in the world.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the album a negative review, saying it was &quot;full of ham-fisted ideas.&quot; Betty Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the band &quot;delve[s] deeper into their tortured psyche while striving to be taken seriously&quot; as pop punk &quot;rhythms crash into string sections, empathy clashes with loathing.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; also gave a negative review, saying: &quot;Half the time, Good Charlotte sound like Blink-182 after the snip, the other half they sound like the Backstreet Boys without the songs.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; found it &quot;nothing if not ambitious&quot;, while lacking &quot;the depth, or the authority, to pull it off.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Jenny Eliscu said the group&#x27;s &quot;usual problem&quot; was their &quot;asinine lyrics.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said that &quot;[b]eyond some rich-and-famous irony, not a single suburban detail soils an hour of good intentions. And you know the music overreaches too.&quot;

===Commercial performance and legacy===
&quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 after selling 199,000 copies in its first week of release. As of February 2007, it had sold 1.1 million copies in the US and has been certified platinum. The album reached number 171 and 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end charts in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Outside of the US, the album charted at: number one in Australia, number two in Canada, number six in Japan, number eight in the UK, number 11 in Austria and New Zealand, number 13 in Sweden, number 20 in Italy and Switzerland. It was certified gold in Austria, Germany and the UK, and platinum in Australia.

&quot;Predictable&quot; charted in the US at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, number 20 on the Mainstream Top 40, and number 28 on the Alternative Songs. Outside of the US, it charted at number 12 in the UK, number 15 in Australia, number 27 in New Zealand, and number 39 in the Netherlands. &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; charted in the US at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 18 on the Mainstream Top 40. Outside of the US, it charted at: number six in New Zealand, number nine in the UK, number 12 in Australia, number 15 in Austria, number 21 in Switzerland, and number 23 in the Netherlands. It was certified gold in the US and Australia. &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; charted at: number 27 in Sweden, number 30 in the UK, number 31 in Australia, number 47 in Switzerland, and number 50 in Austria. &quot;We Believe&quot; charted at number 39 in Austria, and number 99 in the Netherlands.

&quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; was one of the songs that Sony BMG, Epic&#x27;s parent company, paid radio stations to play in the 2005 payola scandal. Two tracks were remixed for inclusion on the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Remixes&quot; (2008) compilation: &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; (by Teddy Riley) and &quot;Predictable&quot; (by Stress the Whiteboy featuring Rahzii Hi-Power). &quot;Predictable&quot;, &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; and &quot;We Believe&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2010) compilation. In 2016, Benji Madden said of the album: &quot;We were showing our depth. We didn&#x27;t want any rules, we didn&#x27;t want any boundaries ... We wanted to do the things that we wanted to do.&quot; The following year, Joel Madden added: &quot;&#x27;Chronicles&#x27; was us putting something above the success and it cemented us as the band who will always go left when you want us to go right.&quot;

Over time, the album has been recognized for its boldness and the band&#x27;s effort to mature their sound. &quot;WhatCulture&quot; ranked it among Good Charlotte&#x27;s top albums, noting it as &quot;the first time the band stepped away from their &#x27;norm&#x27; and rebelled.&quot;

<text>India pale ale (IPA) is a hoppy beer style within the broader category of pale ale. It originated in the United Kingdom to be exported to India, which was under the control of the British East India Company until 1858. Its higher hop content acted as a natural preservative, preventing it from spoiling during the long shipping voyage. IPA has since regained significant popularity, and is associated with craft beer.

==History==

The pale ales of the early 18th century were lightly hopped and quite different from today&#x27;s pale ales. By the mid-18th century, pale ale was brewed mostly with coke-fired malt, which produced less smoking and roasting of barley in the malting process, and hence produced a paler beer. One variety was October beer, a pale well-hopped brew popular among the landed gentry, who brewed it domestically; once brewed, it was intended to cellar two years.

Among the first brewers known to export beer to India was George Hodgson&#x27;s Bow Brewery, on the Middlesex-Essex boundary. Its beers became popular among East India Company traders&#x27; provisions in the late 18th century for being two miles up the Lea from the East India Docks, and Hodgson&#x27;s liberal credit line of 18 months. Ships exported this beer to India, among them his October beer, which benefited exceptionally from conditions of the voyage and was highly regarded among its consumers in India. The brewery came into the control of Hodgson&#x27;s son early in the next century,

Burton breweries lost their export market in Continental Europe, including Scandinavia and Russia, when the Napoleonic blockade was imposed, and were seeking a new export market for their beer.

At the behest of the East India Company, Allsopp&#x27;s brewery&#x27;s chief maltser, Job Goodhead, developed a strongly-hopped pale ale in the style of Hodgson&#x27;s for export to India. Other Burton brewers, including Bass and Salt and Co, followed Allsopp&#x27;s lead, taking advantage of Burton water in brewing similar beers.

London East End brewer Charrington&#x27;s trial shipments of hogsheads of &quot;India Ale&quot; to Madras and Calcutta in 1827 proved successful and a regular trade emerged with the key British agents and retailers: Griffiths &amp; Co in Madras; Adam, Skinner and Co. in Bombay and Bruce, Allen &amp; Co. in Calcutta.

Early IPAs were only slightly higher in alcohol than other beers brewed then, but more of the wort was fermented, meaning few residual sugars, and they were heavily hopped. While IPAs were formulated to survive long voyages by sea better than other styles of the time, porter was also successfully shipped to India and California.

By the 1860s, India pale ales were widely brewed in England, and they were much more attenuated and hopped than porters and ales.

Demand for the export style of pale ale, which had become known as &quot;India pale ale&quot;, developed in England around 1840 and India pale ale became a popular product in England. In 1837, Hodgson&#x27;s IPA typically cost 6/6 (p; ) for a dozen pint bottles, the same as Guinness Double Stout, 53% more than the 4/3 (p; equivalent to £) a dozen for those of porter. Some brewers dropped the term &quot;India&quot; in the late 19th century, but records indicated that these &quot;pale ales&quot; retained the features of earlier IPAs. American, Australian, and Canadian brewers manufactured beer with the label IPA before 1900, and records suggest that these beers were similar to English IPA of the era.

IPA style beers started being exported to other colonial countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, around this time with many breweries dropping the &#x27;I&#x27; in &#x27;IPA&#x27; and simply calling them Pale Ales or Export Pales. Kirkstall Brewery and many competitors sent much export beer across the world by steam ship to auction off to wholesalers upon arrival.

==United Kingdom==

India pale ale was well known as early as 1815, but gained popularity in the British domestic market sometime before then. By World War I, IPA in Britain had diverged into two styles, the premium bottled IPAs of around 1.065 specific gravity and cask-conditioned draught IPAs which were among the weakest beers on the bar. For instance Bass was 1.065 OG and 6.4% ABV, but in 1912 Whitbread&#x27;s draught IPA was 1.049 and less than 5% ABV, at a time when the average British beer was 1.055. Like all British beers, their strength declined during World War I and by 1923 Bass was 1.055 and Whitbread IPA was a bottled beer of 1.036 and 3.7% (compared to their standard X Mild at 1.042 and their draught bitter at 1.042). Greene King IPA (3.7%) and Charles Wells Eagle IPA (3.6%) are examples of IPAs in this tradition.

Worthington&#x27;s White Shield is an example of a historic India Pale Ale, first brewed in 1829 principally for export to the British Empire. By the 1960s White Shield had become a cult drink brewed in small quantities for a dedicated following, but it found renewed popularity in the early 1970s when the demand for real ale grew in the UK.

The revival of IPA in modern times dates to a seminar on Burton pale ales organised by publican Mark Dorber at his pub, the White Horse, Parson&#x27;s Green, in 1990. That led to a pale ale festival in 1992 and an IPA festival in 1993, for which Bass brewed a 7.2% beer inspired by Bass Continental, originally brewed for the Belgian market before World War II and based on Bass recipes going back to the 1850s. Dorber and Roger Protz then organised an IPA conference in 1994 at Whitbread&#x27;s brewery in London, attended by brewers from both sides of the Atlantic. The influence of this meeting persists, for instance Brooklyn Brewery&#x27;s East India IPA is based on the beer that Garrett Oliver took there.

In the 21st century, US-influenced IPA is one of the most popular beer styles in the UK. In 2019, Brewdog&#x27;s Punk IPA was the country&#x27;s best selling craft beer in the on-trade and Swannay&#x27;s Muckle IPA won overall craft keg gold in SIBA&#x27;s Independent Beer Awards.

==United States==
In the late 20th century craft beer revolution in the United States, brewers began seeking out old beer styles that had fallen out of vogue; Ballantine IPA, which had been made in the U.S. since 1890 until the 1990s, proved inspirational. The traditional IPA style was well-suited to model the intense flavour and aroma of American hops. Bert Grant of Yakima Brewing and Malting identified that Cascade and Chinook hops, grown locally in Yakima, Washington, provided strong flavours when showcased in an IPA. The boom in popularity for IPA as a style spread down the west coast of the United States, then across the United States and eventually the world. It is estimated that over 40% of craft beer brewed in the United States can be classified as an IPA.

As the &quot;Oxford Companion to Beer&quot; notes: &quot;IPA is now the signature of craft brewers worldwide. Fittingly for an export beer, brewers from Australia to Scandinavia are creating new beers, mostly inspired by the American take on the style, but often adding a regional twist of their own.&quot;

=== American varieties ===

==== American IPA (West Coast IPA or Classic IPA) ====
With the explosion of IPA subtypes, the traditional American IPA is often differentiated by calling it a West Coast IPA or Classic IPA. American IPAs are hop-forward in character, with classic examples from the West Coast of the United States in the 2000s (first decade of millennium) being especially bitter. They often have brilliant clarity and are dry with minimal malt character, although some slight haze caused by high hopping rates is common and acceptable. Being highly hopped, West Coast / American IPAs are typically very bitter, between 40 and 70 IBUs. As such, they commonly taste of resin as well as citrus and tropical fruit from the use of American &quot;C&quot; hops, although these are not the only hops that can be used. Often breweries around the world emulating the style will use local New-World hop varieties, or may use a combination of American and local hops.

==== Black IPA ====

Black IPA (also known as Cascadian Dark Ale (CDA) or American Black Ale) is not pale in color despite the &quot;IPA&quot; in the name implying it is a &quot;pale ale&quot;. Black IPAs share the bitter hoppy flavors of other IPAs and have a strong malt backbone; however, they use dehusked roasted malts to give them a darker color, and somewhat of a coffee or roasted flavor. The origin of the style lies with Vermont Pub &amp; Brewery in Burlington, Vermont. In 1989 or 1990, owner and head brewer Greg Noonan created a strong, roasty, &quot;winter IPA&quot; called Tartan IPA, inspired by a local, hoppy, dark red ale. A few years later, Noonan&#x27;s protégé, Glenn Walter, embittered by a pending divorce, brewed an extremely bitter version of the beer, named Blackwatch IPA. Finally, in 1995, John Kimmich, Noonan protégé, found the recipe card, and having recently learned of dehusked black malt, which has , asked Noonan if he could rebrew the beer with a less roasty flavor, resulting in the first example of the Black IPA style. Black IPAs became popularized in the United States until 2009.

==== Brut IPA ====
A crisp, dry, fruity, and highly-carbonated IPA with very low body, the Brut IPA was invented by Kim Sturdavant, head brewer at San Francisco&#x27;s Social Kitchen and Brewery. A Brut IPA is intended to be reminiscent of brut sparkling wines, with the nose and flavor of grapes or berries, and an effervescent level of carbonation. To make a brut IPA, brewers add the enzyme amyloglucosidase to break down malt sugars more than typical for ales, which will be fermented by yeast, leaving less residual sugar than a typical ale and resulting in the characteristic dry and thinly-bodied beer. The hops are usually selected to lend a white wine or fruity aroma and flavor, most notably the Nelson Sauvin and Hallertau Blanc hop varietals, which lend flavors characteristic of white wines.

==== Cold IPA ====
A Cold IPA is a hoppy beer style inspired by India pale ale. The substyle is typically made partially in the style of American macrolagers, such as Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Budweiser or Miller&#x27;s High Life, with a malt bill that includes a substantial portion of maize, rice, or dextrose adjunct, and the use of lager yeast, and partially like an American IPA, with hops added to provide both substantial bitterness and hop flavors and aromas, and fermented at temperatures warmer than commonly used for lager fermentation (14-17°C).

==== Double IPA ====

Double IPAs (also referred to as Imperial IPAs) are a stronger, very hoppy variant of IPAs that typically have alcohol content above 7.5% by volume. The term &quot;double&quot; refers to the increased amount of ingredients used, particularly hops, which results in a beer that is both higher in alcohol and richer in the hop character compared to a standard IPA. The style is claimed to have originated in 1994 with Inaugural Ale at the now-defunct Blind Pig Brewery in Temecula, California, which was brewed by Vinnie Cilurzo to celebrate the brewery&#x27;s first anniversary. Cilurzo is credited as being the inventor of the style. Cilurzo, as founder and the head brewer of Russian River Brewing Company, created another Double IPA between 1999 and 2001, Pliny the Elder, which is considered a seminal example of the Double IPA style.

==== India Pale Lager ====
India pale lager (IPL) is not an IPA at all, in the sense of being an ale, but is nevertheless considered a substyle of IPA. IPL comprises a traditional American IPA wort, or pre-fermented beer, that is fermented with traditional lager yeast at colder, lager fermentation temperatures (10-13°C) rather than the warmer temperatures (17-20°C) at which IPAs are normally fermented. The use of traditional lager yeast can result in a beer that has a characteristic clean and crisp flavor typical of lager beers, as well as in some cases, slight sulfuric character, which is a common characteristic of some lager beers. IPL tend to be dry hopped after fermentation just like regular, American IPAs. 

==== Midwest IPA ====
With the extreme dryness and bitterness of West Coast IPAs, some beer connoisseurs have observed that IPAs in some parts of the United States, especially in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states, have a maltier backbone and flavor profile that is more balanced between bitterness and hop presentation and malt character. These beers tend to be more amber or copper in color as well, due to the malt. These observers point to beers such as Bell&#x27;s Brewery&#x27;s Two Hearted Ale and Surly Brewing&#x27;s Furious IPA as examples of this phenomenon. Others have observed that this is not a new phenomenon, and early American IPAs, such as Shipyard Brewing&#x27;s Shipyard IPA, were maltier because they were modeled after English IPAs regardless of where in the USA they were made. Others have argued that Midwest IPA is not a substyle at all, and Midwest IPA is not a recognized substyle of IPA by either the Beer Judge Certification Program&#x27;s in its 2021 Beer Style Guidelines or by the Brewers Association in its 2024 Beer Style Guidelines.

==== New England IPA ====
New England IPA (NEIPA, also referred to as Hazy IPA or Juicy IPA or, less frequently, Vermont IPA) is a type of Double IPA was invented by John Kimmich in 2004 at the Alchemist Brewery in Waterbury, Vermont with the beer Heady Topper. Characterized by juicy citrus and floral flavors, with an emphasis on hop aroma with lower bitterness, they also have a smooth consistency or mouthfeel, and a hazy appearance. These characteristics are achieved using a combination of brewing techniques, including the use of particular strains of yeast, the use of oats or wheat in the malt bill to promote haze, the timing of adding the hops, and adjusting the chemistry of the brewing water. New England IPAs do not necessarily need to be brewed in New England. It was officially recognized as a separate beer style, the Juicy or Hazy India Pale Ale, by the Brewers Association in 2018. A variation on the style is the milkshake IPA, which adds lactose and occasionally fruit to make a New England IPA more creamy.

==== Triple IPA ====
Triple IPAs are characterized by higher hop flavors and higher alcohol content, with alcohol content usually over 10% ABV. 

==== White IPA ====
White IPAs combine the flavors of an American IPA and a Belgian-style witbeer. One origin story suggests that the White IPA subtype was created in collaboration between Larry Sidor, the brewmaster at Oregon-based Deschutes Brewery, and Belgian-born Steven Pauwels, brewmaster at Boulevard Brewing in 2010. However, the substyle probably predated that collaboration brew, with Belgian-type IPAs with witbier-like qualities debuting before then, such as Brasserie Dunham&#x27;s IPA Belge (2009), Brouwerij Van den Bossche&#x27;s Buffalo Belgian Bitter (2009), and Flying Dog Brewery&#x27;s Raging Bitch (2009), which was made by combining their house witbier yeast their citrus-forward Snake Dog IPA recipe. Furthermore, well prior to 2010, breweries were known to pour a concoction of draft beer comprising half IPA and half American wheat beer or Belgian witbier. One such example is at Odell Brewery in Colorado, where their Elephant IPA was blended with East Street Wheat (beer) and sold as &quot;Easy Elephant&quot;.

<text>The naval Battle of Gibraltar took place on 25 April 1607, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, when a Dutch fleet surprised and engaged a Spanish fleet anchored at the Bay of Gibraltar. During the four hours of action, most of the Spanish ships were destroyed.

== Forces ==
A Dutch fleet of 26 warships was led by Admiral Jacob van Heemskerk. The Dutch flagship was &quot;Æolus&quot; (of the Zeeland Admiralty). Other Dutch ships were &quot;De Roode Leeuw&quot; (also of the Zeeland Admiralty, and flagship of Vice-Admiral Laurens Jacobszoon Alteras), &quot;De Tijger&quot; (of the Maas Admiralty, and flagship of Rear-Admiral Lambert Hendrikszoon), &quot;De Zeehond&quot;, &quot;De Griffioen&quot;, &quot;De Gouden Leeuw&quot;, &quot;De Zwarte Beer&quot;, &quot;De Witte Beer&quot;, and &quot;De Ochtendster&quot;.

A Spanish fleet of 21 ships, including 10 galleons, was led by Don Juan Álvarez de Avilés. The Spanish flagship &quot;San Augustin&quot; was commanded by Don Juan&#x27;s son. Other ships were &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Vega&quot; and &quot;Madre de Dios&quot;. The Spanish fleet was covered by a fortress, although the Dutch fleet was out of range of its guns at all times and the fortress guns were not able to affect the battle.

== Battle ==

Van Heemskerk left some of his ships at the bay entrance to prevent the escape of any Spanish ships. Twenty from the Dutch fleet were ordered to focus on the Spanish galleons while the rest attacked the smaller vessels. Van Heemskerk was killed during the first approach on the Spanish flagship as a cannonball severed his leg. The Dutch then doubled up on the galleons and a few of the galleons caught fire. One exploded due to a shot that penetrated its powder magazine. The Dutch captured the Spanish flagship but let it go adrift.

Following the destruction of the Spanish ships, the Dutch deployed boats and killed hundreds of swimming Spanish sailors. The Dutch lost 100 men including Admiral Van Heemskerk. Sixty Dutch were wounded. Depending on the sources, most or all of the Spanish ships were lost and between 350 and 4,000 Spaniards were killed or captured. Álvarez de Avilés was amongst the dead.

== Consequences ==
The battle was a leading driver of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, under which the Dutch Republic achieved &quot;de facto&quot; recognition by the Spanish Crown.

The battle had an important indirect effect on the History of Ireland, specifically the key event known as &quot;Flight of the Earls&quot;. Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O&#x27;Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, left Ulster in Ireland with the intention of getting a Spanish army to invade Ireland on their behalf. The destruction of the Spanish fleet ruled out any such option, and the Earls found themselves in irrevocable exile – with major consequences for the later history of Ireland, and especially of Ulster.

<text>Egilsstaðir () is a town in east Iceland on the banks of the Lagarfljót river.

It is part of the municipality of Múlaþing and the largest settlement of the Eastern Region with, as of 2024, a population of 2,632 inhabitants. Formerly Egilsstaðir was part of Norður-Múlasýsla.

==Overview==

Egilsstadir is located at . The town is young, even by Icelandic standards where urbanization is a fairly recent trend compared to mainland Europe. It was established in 1947 as an effort by the surrounding rural districts recognizing it had become a regional service centre. The town takes name from an individual farmstead and is in this respect relatively unique within the country where most or all of the towns take name from broader landmarks.
It is near the bridge over Lagarfljót where all the main roads of the region meet, Route 1 as well as the main routes to the Eastern Region.

Egilsstaðir has grown to become the largest town of East Iceland and its main service, transportation, and administration centre. The town has an airport, college, and a hospital. The town grew quickly during the economic boom in the region from 2004 to 2008 associated with the building of the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant and Alcoa&#x27;s aluminium smelting plant in Reyðarfjörður. The growth has slowed markedly since the banking collapse in 2008.

==History==

In written accounts, Egilsstaðir is first mentioned in the 15th century as a place for legislative assembly. Nothing is therefore known with certainty about the individual person Egil lending it its name, the only conjecture to this effect met with in books detailing the story of the town is that it may be named after Egil Síðu-Hallsson, but Hallr at Síða was a captain in the east and an uncle to Rollo in France, but this guess is of controlled probability and most likely the person left no other recort of himself. The nearby river Eyvindará is mentioned in the Saga of the Sons of Droplaug and Saga of the inhabitants of Fljótsdalur.
Urbanization in Egilsstaðir can be traced to Jón Bergsson (1855–1923), a farmer, who laid the groundwork for increased commerce and services at the Egilsstaðir farm by erecting a large residential building there at the start of the 20th century. The house is still in use as a hotel. Jón bought the farm Egilsstaðr at the close of the 19th century because of its location when he predicted &quot;Crossroads will be here&quot;, which proved prescient.
Along with others, Jón Bergsson also took the initiative to establish the co-operative Kaupfélag Héraðsbúa (KHB) with headquarters there in 1909.

In subsequent years, bridges were built over Lagarfljót river and Eyvindará river and a road made over Fagridalur to Reyðarfjörður. Later, the regional headquarters for mail and telephone services were located at Egilsstaðir.
In 1947 Egilsstaðir was incorporated as a town and a rural jurisdiction Egilsstaðahreppur, with neighbouring jurisdictions Vallahreppur and Eiðahreppur joining the new jurisdiction. The town soon grew and by 1980 the population exceeded 1000. In 1987, the status of the town was upgraded to kaupstaður and renamed Egilsstaðabær, or the town of Egilsstaðir. In early 2011, the population was 2,257 and had increased by 41 percent from 2001, when 1,600 were registered there.

On 7 June 1998 Egilsstaðabær was united with Vallahreppur, Skriðdalshreppur, Eiðahreppur and Hjaltastaðarhreppur under the name &quot;Austur-Hérað&quot;. Austur-Hérað then became Fljótsdalshérað in 2004. In 2020 it joined other municipalities to form Múlaþing.
==Climate==
Depending on isotherm Egilsstaðir has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) or a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;) bordering very closely on a Tundra climate (&quot;ET)&quot;. Winters there tend to be colder than other towns in the area, and summers tend to have daytime highs often exceeding , higher than most of Iceland, but at night it is colder than most towns with a similar climate. The town being at a relatively low elevation somewhat shielded from maritime winds enables warmer air to stay for longer than in coastal areas, although the effect of southerlies become negated by high mountains blocking such winds, and as a result Egilsstaðir still has a lot cooler summers than continental Nordic climates have on similar latitudes. Egilsstaðir being relatively close to the east coast also increased the maritime moderation both in summer and winter. With Central Iceland being at a highland tundra, the Egilsstaðir area is still the warmest for 1961–1990 summer maxima among Icelandic weather stations for populated areas.

The figures here given for precipitation days and sunshine hours belong to Grímsárvirkjun and Hallormsstaður, which are and away from Egilsstaðir respectively and get around more precipitation than Egilsstaðir, so it is possible that Egilsstaðir has fewer days with precipitation and gets more sunlight than stated below. The highest temperature recorded is on 11 August 2004, recorded at Egilsstaðir Airport.

The climate has significantly warmed in recent years, as seen in the climate averages for the 1991–2020 reference period.

<text>Arp Schnitger (2 July 164828 July 1719 (buried)) was an influential Northern German organ builder. Considered the paramount manufacturer of his time, Schnitger built or rebuilt over 150 organs. He was primarily active in Northern Europe, especially the Netherlands and Germany, where a number of his instruments still survive.

==Biography==
Schnitger was born near Schmalenfleth in Oldenburg, Germany, and was baptized on 9 July 1648 in Golzwarden. The exact date of Schnitger&#x27;s birth is unknown; the scholar Gustav Fock hypothesises it was on 2 July 1648, a week before his baptism. Schnitger was born into a family of woodworkers and wood carvers. He was apprenticed at the age of 18. Between 1666 and 1671, Schnitger studied organ building with his cousin Berendt Huss ( 1630-1676) in Glückstadt and worked as a journeyman. 
In 1682, Schnitger and his workshop moved to Hamburg. In 1708, he was appointed organ builder of the Prussian court. In 1684, Schnitger was married to Gertrude Otte (1665-1707). His sons Franz Caspar and Johann Jürgen Schnitger trained with their father and continued his work after his death. His burial was recorded in the parish of St. Pancratiuskirche at Neuenfelde-Hamburg on 28 July 1719. 
Schnitger was one of the most prolific builders of his time, having built approximately 95 new instruments, rebuilt about 30, and repaired or renovated another 30. He ran several shops and had a team in Magdeburg, in Bremen and in Groningen. His organ designs typify the essential North German organ: multiple divisions, usually with a &quot;rückpositif&quot; (division on the gallery rail, behind the player&#x27;s back); large, independent pedal divisions, often placed in towers on either side of the main case; well-developed principal choruses in each division with abundant reeds, flutes, and mutation stops; and meantone temperament. All of these features could be found on North German organs prior to Schnitger&#x27;s activity; Schnitger&#x27;s genius lay in his ability to synthesize these elements into a prototypical style of organ building, and in his prolific output. The latter was made possible by his good business sense: Schnitger was one of the first builders to use cost-cutting measures on a large scale to ensure the affordability of organs for small village churches.

One of Schnitger&#x27;s landmark instruments, the organ at St. Jacobikirche, Hamburg, was a renovation and enlargement of an instrument previously rebuilt in 1636 by Gottfried Fritzsche (1578–1638).

==Notable examples of his work still in use==

*St. Cosmae und Damianikirche, Stade (Schnitger&#x27;s first organ, completed in 1676 after the death of his teacher Berendt Huss)

*St. Peter und Paulkirche, Cappel (perhaps the most authentic of Schnitger&#x27;s organs still in existence, originally in the Johanniskirche, Hamburg, 1680)

*St. Pancratiuskirche, Neuenfelde, Hamburg (completed in 1688, his largest two-manual instrument); 

*St. Ludgerikirche, Norden (1688)

*Martinikerk, Groningen, the Netherlands (1692)

*St. Jacobikirche, Hamburg (perhaps the most famous surviving Schnitger organ, completed in 1693) 

*Grote or St. Michaëlskerk, Zwolle, the Netherlands (completed by his son Franz Caspar after Schnitger&#x27;s death)

==Legacy==
Organs like these are credited with inspiring the renaissance in organ building during the early twentieth century, with a return to tracker action and smaller, more cohesive instruments, as distinct from the late-Romantic trend of extremely large symphonic organs. In particular, the organ at the Jacobikirche, Hamburg, played a pivotal role in the organ reform movement beginning in 1925, as a series of conferences taking place at historical organ sites in Germany and Alsace was inaugurated there. 

A number of Schnitger&#x27;s organs were featured on recordings by E. Power Biggs, who is generally credited with reintroducing them to modern listeners. More recently, Schnitger&#x27;s organs can be heard on several recordings by German organist Harald Vogel. Schnitger&#x27;s instruments in Groningen, Uithuizen, Noordbroek and Nieuw Scheemda were featured in the documentary &quot;Martinikerk Rondeau&quot;, in which Jürgen Ahrend, Cor Edskes and Bernhardt H. Edskes  detail Schnitger&#x27;s life and demonstrate his working methods. Schnitger&#x27;s organs have also served as inspiration for many modern builders; GOArt, a Swedish organ building consortium, has even gone so far as to build an exact copy of a Schnitger organ for research purposes.

<text>The so-called Circus of Nero or Circus of Caligula was a circus in ancient Rome, located mostly in the present-day Vatican City. 

It was first built under Caligula.

==History==
The &quot;Ager Vaticanus&quot;, the alluvial plain outside the city walls on the west bank of the Tiber, was developed at the end of the first century BC, allowing patrician families to construct luxurious private residences (&quot;Horti&quot;). The Horti Agrippinae villa-estate belonged to Agrippina the Elder and was inherited by her son Caligula (r. 31–41 AD). He was a chariot-racing enthusiast and began construction of the circus which was completed by Claudius (r. 41-54 AD).

The privately owned &quot;circus&quot; and &quot;Horti&quot; were then inherited by Nero who made the circus public so he could invite them to cheer him on. He also used both of these to lodge Romans made homeless by the great fire of 64. The circus was used in 65 to carry out mass executions of the Christians accused as scapegoats of the fire itself. Because of this the area beyond the Tiber north of Trastevere was known as &quot;Nero&#x27;s meadows&quot; until the end of the Middle Ages. 

The circus was also the site of St. Peter’s and St. Paul’s martyrdom.

The circus was abandoned by the middle of the second century AD, when the area was partitioned and given in concession to private individuals for the construction of tombs in the necropolis.

Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was erected by Constantine over the site using some of the existing structure of the Circus of Nero. The basilica was sited so that its apse was centred on Peter&#x27;s tomb (now beneath the high altar of the current St Peter&#x27;s Basilica). Most of the ruins of the Circus survived until 1450, when they were finally destroyed by the construction of the new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Place of martyrdom==

The circus was the site of the first organized, state-sponsored martyrdoms of Christians in 65 AD. Tradition holds that two years later, Saint Peter and many other Christians shared their fate. The circumstances were described in detail by Tacitus in a well-known passage of the &quot;Annals&quot; (xv.44).

The site for crucifixions in the Circus would have been along the &quot;spina&quot; (&quot;spine&quot;), as suggested by the 2nd century Acts of Peter describing the spot of his martyrdom as &quot;inter duas metas&quot; (&quot;between the two &quot;metae&quot; or turning-posts&quot;, which would have been equidistant between the two ends of the circus). The obelisk at the centre of this circus&#x27;s &quot;spina&quot; always remained standing, until it was re-erected in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square in the 16th century by the architect Domenico Fontana. The obelisk was originally brought to Rome by Caligula.

==Nearby Roman cemetery==

The Via Cornelia ran parallel with the north side of the Circus, and its course can be traced with precision, for pagan tombs have been discovered at various times along its edges. Sante Bartoli&#x27;s memoirs record that when Alexander VII was building the left wing of Bernini&#x27;s colonnade and the lefthand fountain, a tomb was discovered with a bas-relief above the door representing a marriage-scene (&quot;vi era un bellissimo bassorilievo di un matrimonio antico&quot;). Others were soon found. The best discovery, that of pagan tombs exactly on the line of St Peter&#x27;s tomb, was made in the presence of Grimaldi, 9 November 1616:
:On that day, I entered a square sepulchral room the ceiling of which was ornamented with designs in painted stucco. There was a medallion in the centre, with a figure in high relief. The door opened on the Via Cornelia, which was on the same level. This tomb is located under the seventh step in front of the middle door of the church. I am told that the sarcophagus now used as a fountain, in the court of the Swiss Guards, was discovered at the time of Gregory XIII in the same place, and that it contained the body of a pagan.

<text>Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown, FBA (born Alfred Reginald Brown; 1881–1955) was an English social anthropologist who helped further develop the theory of structural functionalism. He conducted fieldwork in the Andaman Islands and Western Australia, which became the basis of his later books. He held academic appointments at universities in Cape Town, Sydney, Chicago, and Oxford, and sought to use model the field of anthopology after the natural sciences.

== Biography ==
Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown was born Alfred Reginald Brown in Sparkbrook, Birmingham, England, the second son of Alfred Brown (d.1886), a manufacturer&#x27;s clerk, and his wife Hannah (née Radcliffe). He later changed his last name, by deed poll, to Radcliffe-Brown, Radcliffe being his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1905; M.A., 1909), graduating with first-class honours in the moral sciences tripos. At Trinity College, he was elected Anthony Wilkin student in 1906 and 1909. While still a student, he earned the nickname &quot;Anarchy Brown&quot; for his close interest in the writings of the anarcho-communist and scientist Peter Kropotkin.

:&quot;Like other young men with blood in their veins, I wanted to do something to reform the world – to get rid of poverty and war, and so on. So I read Godwin, Proudhon, Marx and innumerable others. Kropotkin, revolutionary, but still a scientist, pointed out how important for any attempt to improve society was a scientific understanding of it.&quot;

He studied psychology under W. H. R. Rivers who, with A. C. Haddon, led him toward social anthropology. Under the latter&#x27;s influence, he travelled to the Andaman Islands (1906–1908) and Western Australia (1910–1912, with biologist and writer E. L. Grant Watson and Australian writer Daisy Bates) to conduct fieldwork into the workings of the societies there.

His time in the Andaman Islands and Western Australia were the basis of his later books &quot;The Andaman Islanders&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Social Organization of Australian Tribes&quot; (1930). At the 1914 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in Melbourne, Bates accused him of plagiarising her work, based on an unpublished manuscript she had sent him for comment.

Before departing for Western Australia, Brown married Winifred Marie Lyon in Cambridge; they had one daughter, Mary Cynthia Lyon Radcliffe. The couple became estranged by about 1926. They may have divorced in 1938 (sources disagree on whether a divorce was completed).

In 1916 Brown became a director of education in Tonga. In 1921 he moved to Cape Town to become professor of social anthropology, founding the School of African Life. Further university appointments were University of Cape Town (1921–25), University of Sydney (1925–31) and University of Chicago (1931–37). Among his most prominent students during his years at the University of Chicago were Sol Tax and Fred Eggan.

While at the University of Sydney, he was a cultivator of the arts and championed Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, as the author of the works attributed to Shakespeare. Fearing that Depression may lead to financial collapse Radcliffe-Brown departed in 1931 to fill a chair at the University of Chicago, leaving his successors to solicit Rockefeller grants and government funds to save the Sydney Department.

After these various far-flung appointments, he returned to England in 1937 to take up an appointment to the first chair in social anthropology at Oxford University in 1937. He held this post until his retirement in 1946. Survived by his daughter, he died in London in 1955 at the age of 74.

While Radcliffe-Brown founded the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at Oxford, according to Rodney Needham his absence from the institute during the war years prevented his theories and approach from having a major influence on Oxford anthropology.

== Influences ==
Radcliffe-Brown was influenced by his tutor, W. W. Rouse Ball, to study a moral science (psychology, philosophical subjects, and economics) instead of a natural science which he originally wanted to pick. During his time at Cambridge, professors Haddon and Rivers encouraged him to study anthropology and discover his interests in the field. Haddon led him towards the comparative method in specific societies in anthropology, classification and morphology, inductive generalization, and to sympathize with Durkheim&#x27;s approaches. Rivers inspired Radcliffe in psychology to approach anthropology with many different qualities of mind.

== Work ==
He has been described as &quot;the classic to Bronisław Malinowski&#x27;s romantic&quot;. Radcliffe-Brown brought French sociology (namely Émile Durkheim) to British anthropology, constructing a rigorous battery of concepts to frame ethnography.

Durkheim, inspired Radcliffe-Brown throughout the entirety of his profession in anthropology. One of Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s goals was to &quot;transform anthropology into a &#x27;real&#x27; science based on the natural sciences.&quot; He demonstrated these ideologies in his book published in 1957, &quot;A Natural Science of Society&quot;.

In 1906, one of Alfred&#x27;s primary focuses in the field [Andaman Islands] was kinship and familial relations of Western Australians. Within these communities, he uncovered distinct social organizations that proved adaptation and fusion were essential in keeping the system functioning. The term “Structural Functionalism” would later be used to describe the idea that “the life of a society may be viewed as an active system of functionally consistent, interdependent elements.”

=== Concept of function ===
Radcliffe-Brown has often been associated with functionalism, and is considered by some to be the founder of structural functionalism. Structural Functionalism, which can be traced back to sociologist Émile Durkheim, is the social theory that assumes societal institution (e.g. Government, school systems, family structures,etc.) play a role in its success. Through the two different group dynamics;  &quot;Mechanical solidarity&quot; a “sentimental attraction of social units or groups that perform the same or similar functions”  &amp; &quot;Organic solidarity&quot;, which is relies on “interdependence based on differentiated functions and specialization”, a society creates a web that allows a cohesive existence of heterogenous groups. Alfred built off of these principles believing that studying social structures like kinship ties would be evidence enough for understanding how social structures affect the maintenance of a society stating, “human beings are connected by a complex network of social relations. I use the term “social structure” to denote this network of actually existing relations”. (On Social Structure, 190)  He also clarifies that “We may define it as a condition in which all parts of the system work together with a sufficient degree of harmony or internal consistency, i.e., without producing persistent conflicts which can neither be resolved nor regulated”.  (On the Concept of Function in Social Science, 181). Nonetheless, Radcliffe-Brown vehemently denied being a functionalist, and carefully distinguished his concept of function from that of Malinowski, who openly advocated functionalism. While Malinowski&#x27;s functionalism claimed that social practices could be directly explained by their ability to satisfy basic biological needs, Radcliffe-Brown rejected this as baseless. Instead, influenced by the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, he claimed that the fundamental units of anthropology were processes of human life and interaction. Because these are by definition characterized by constant flux, what calls for explanation is the occurrence of stability. Why Radcliffe-Brown asked, would some patterns of social practices repeat themselves and even seem to become fixed? He reasoned that this would at least require that other practices must not conflict with them too much; and that in some cases, it may be that practices grow to support each other, a notion he called &#x27;coadaptation&#x27;, deriving from the biological term. Functional analysis, then, was just the attempt to explain stability by discovering how practices fit together to sustain that stability; the &#x27;function&#x27; of practice was just its role in sustaining the overall social structure, insofar as there was a stable social structure (Radcliffe-Brown 1957).

:&quot;&quot;Malinowski has explained that he is the inventor of functionalism, to which he gave its name. His definition of it is clear; it is the theory or doctrine that every feature of culture of any people past or present is to be explained by reference to seven biological needs of individual human beings. I cannot speak for the other writers to whom the label functionalist is applied by the authors, though I very much doubt if Redfield or Linton accept this doctrine. As for myself I reject it entirely, regarding it as useless and worse. As a consistent opponent of Malinowski&#x27;s functionalism I may be called an anti-functionalist.&quot;

=== Concept of social structure ===
While Lévi-Strauss (1958) claimed that social structure and the social relations that are its constituents are theoretical constructions used to model social life, Radcliffe-Brown only half-agreed

:&quot;to say we are studying social structures is not exactly the same thing as saying that we study social relations, which is how some sociologists define their subject. A particular social relation between two persons (unless they be Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden) exists only as part of a wide network of social relations, involving many other persons, and it is this network which I regard as the object of our investigations.
:&quot;&quot;I am aware, of course, that the term &quot;social structure&quot; is used in a number of different senses, some of them very vague. This is unfortunately true of many other terms commonly used by anthropologists. The choice of terms and their definitions is a matter of scientific convenience, but one of the characteristics of a science as soon as it has passed the first formative period is the existence of technical terms which are used in the same precise meaning by all the students of that science. By this test, I regret to say, social anthropology reveals itself as not yet a formed science.&quot;&quot;&quot;

In addition to identifying abstract relationships between social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued for the importance of the notion of a &#x27;total social structure&#x27;, which is the sum total of social relations in a given social unit of analysis during a given period. The identification of &#x27;functions&#x27; of social practices was supposed to be relative to this total social structure. Lévi-Strauss saw social structure as a model.

Within his research, Radcliffe-Brown focused on so-called &quot;primitive&quot; societies. He believed kinship played a large role in these societies, and that patrilineages, clans, tribes and units all relate to kinship rules in society and are essential in political organization. Radcliffe-Brown claimed that all research on social structure is based on observations, what anthropologists see and hear about individual peoples.

Radcliffe-Brown also argued that the study of social structure encompassed culture, therefore there is no need for a separate field dedicated to culture.

=== Evolutionism, diffusionism, and the role of social anthropology ===
A major view in the study of tribal societies had been that all societies follow a unilineal path (&#x27;evolutionism&#x27;), and that therefore &#x27;primitive&#x27; societies could be understood as earlier stages along that path; conversely, &#x27;modern&#x27; societies contained vestiges of older forms. Another view was that social practices tend to develop only once, and that therefore commonalities and differences between societies could be explained by a historical reconstruction of the interaction between societies (&#x27;diffusionism&#x27;). According to both of these views, the proper way to explain differences between tribal societies and modern ones was historical reconstruction.

Radcliffe-Brown rejected both of these views because of the untestable nature of historical reconstructions. Instead, he argued for the use of the comparative method to find regularities in human societies and thereby build up a genuinely scientific knowledge of social life.
:&quot;For social anthropology the task is to formulate and validate statements about the conditions of existence of social systems (laws of social statics) and the regularities that are observable in social change (laws of social dynamics). This can only be done by the systematic use of the comparative method, and the only justification of that method is the expectation that it will provide us with results of this kind, or, as Boas stated it, will provide us with knowledge of the laws of social development. It will be only in an integrated and organised study in which historical studies and sociological studies are combined that we shall be able to reach a real understanding of the development of human society&quot;

To that end, Radcliffe-Brown argued for a &#x27;natural science of society&#x27;. He claimed that there was an independent role for social anthropology here, separate from psychology, though not in conflict with it. This was because psychology was to be the study of individual mental processes, while social anthropology was to study processes of interaction between people (social relations). Thus he argued for a principled ontological distinction between psychology and social anthropology, in the same way as one might try to make a principled distinction between physics and biology. Moreover, he claimed that existing social scientific disciplines, with the possible exception of linguistics, were arbitrary; once our knowledge of society is sufficient, he argued, we will be able to form subdisciplines of anthropology centred around relatively isolated parts of the social structure. But without extensive scientific knowledge, it is impossible to know where these boundaries should be drawn.

=== Ethnography ===

Radcliffe-Brown carried out extensive fieldwork in the Andaman Islands, Australia, and elsewhere. On the basis of this research, he contributed extensively to the anthropological ideas on kinship, and criticised Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s Alliance theory. He also produced structural analyses of myths, including on the basis of the concept of binary distinctions and dialectical opposition, an idea later echoed by Lévi-Strauss.

=== Views on Religion ===
According to Radcliffe-Brown, the function of religion is to install a sense of dependence on fear and other emotional strain on the human body into a society. Therefore, a major function of religion is to affirm and strengthen sentiments necessary for a society to continue. This idea was developed in Radcliffe-Browns book, &quot;The Adaman Islanders&quot; (Free Press 1963).

=== Criticisms ===
Radcliffe-Brown was often criticised for failing to consider the effect of historical changes in the societies he studied, in particular changes brought about by colonialism. Nevertheless, he is now considered, along with Bronisław Malinowski, as one of the fathers of modern social anthropology.

Many critics also believe that in Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s theory of structural-functionalism, there is an error arising from the assumption that one&#x27;s abstraction of a social situation reflects social reality in all details. Therefore, all analysis is done on the basis of imagination.

<text>Eppa Rixey Jr. (May 3, 1891 – February 28, 1963), nicknamed &quot;Jephtha&quot;, was an American baseball player who played 21 seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds in Major League Baseball from 1912 to 1933 as a left-handed pitcher. Rixey was best known as the National League&#x27;s leader in career victories for a left-hander with 266 wins until Warren Spahn surpassed his total in 1959.

Rixey attended the University of Virginia where he was a star pitcher. He was discovered by umpire Cy Rigler, who convinced him to sign directly with the Phillies, bypassing minor league baseball entirely. His time with the Phillies was marked by inconsistency. He won 22 games in 1916, but also led the league in losses twice. In 1915, the Phillies played in the World Series, and Rixey lost in his only appearance. After being traded to the Reds prior to the 1921 season, he won 20 or more games in a season three times, including a league-leading 25 in 1922, and posted eight consecutive winning seasons. His skills were declining by the 1929 season, when his record was 10–13 with a 4.16 earned run average. He pitched another four seasons before retiring after the 1933 season.

An intellectual who taught high school Latin during the off-season, earning the nickname &quot;Jephtha&quot; for his southern drawl, Rixey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963.

==Early life==
Eppa Rixey Jr. was born on May 3, 1891, in Culpeper, Virginia, to Eppa Rixey and his wife Willie Alice (). At the age of ten, his father, a banker, moved his family to Charlottesville, Virginia. His uncles were John Franklin Rixey, a former congressman, and Presley Marion Rixey, a former Surgeon General of the United States Navy.
He attended the University of Virginia, where he played basketball and baseball; he was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. His brother Bill also played baseball for Virginia. During the off-season, umpire Cy Rigler worked as an assistant coach for the University. He recognized Rixey&#x27;s talent and tried to sign him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Rixey originally declined, saying he wanted to be a chemist, but Rigler insisted, even offering a substantial portion of the bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players. Neither Rixey nor Rigler received any signing bonus.

== Baseball career ==

=== Philadelphia Phillies ===
Rixey joined the Phillies for the 1912 season without playing a single game of minor league baseball. His time with the Phillies was marked by inconsistency. He went 10-10 in his first year, with a 2.50 earned run average (ERA) and 10 complete games in 23 games pitched. He had a three hit shutout against the Chicago Cubs on July 18. Rixey was on the losing end of a no-hitter by Jeff Tesreau on September 6. After the season, the Chicago Cubs, under new manager Johnny Evers, offered a &quot;huge sum&quot; to the Phillies for Rixey, but manager Red Dooin declined the offer. Prior to the 1913 season, Rixey notified the Phillies of his desire to finish his studies at the University of Virginia and graduate in June; however, after some negotiation, he decided to sign a contract and re-joined the team shortly after the season began. That season, he appeared in 35 games, started 19 of them, winning nine games, and had a 3.12 earned run average. In 1914, his record worsened to 2–11, and his earned run average increased to 4.37. Rixey&#x27;s record improved to 11–12 in 1915, and his earned run average was 2.39 as the Phillies won the National League pennant and played the Boston Red Sox in the 1915 World Series. During Game 5 of the series, Rixey replaced starter Erskine Mayer for the final six innings of the game. He allowed three runs in the final two innings and lost 5–4.

Rixey went 22–10 in 1916 with a 1.85 ERA and a career high of 134 strikeouts. On June 29, Rixey pitched a four-hit shutout against the New York Giants, facing the minimum 27 batters, because of three double plays, and a player caught stealing. In 1917, despite having a 2.27 earned run average, Rixey led the league in pitching losses with 21. He also handled 108 chances without a single error. Rixey hated losing and was known for destroying the team locker room, or disappearing for days at a time after a loss. He missed the 1918 season to serve in the Chemical Warfare Division of the United States army during the war effort. He struggled upon returning to baseball, going 6–12 with a 3.97 earned run average in 1919, and again leading the league in losses with 22 in 1920. Prior to the 1920 season, rumours circulated that his former manager, Pat Moran, now with the Cincinnati Reds, was interested in trading for Rixey. The relationship between Rixey and manager Gavvy Cravath was never good, and Cravath had made known his desire to trade him; however, he stayed with the Phillies that season, working on his delivery with former pitcher Jesse Tannehill, who, Rixey admitted, helped with his pitching delivery.
On November 22, 1920, Rixey was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Jimmy Ring and Greasy Neale. His record during his eight seasons with the Phillies was 87 wins and 103 losses.

=== Cincinnati Reds ===

In his first season with the Reds, Rixey won 19 games, and set a Major League record by allowing just one home run in 301 innings pitched. In three of the next four seasons, he had 20 or more victories each season, with a league-leading total of 25 in 1922. He also led the league in innings pitched and hits allowed in 1922 and shutouts with four in 1924. In 1926 he had 14 wins, followed by seasons of 12, 19 and 10 wins. Rixey&#x27;s production began to decline in 1930, when he went 9–13 with a 5.10 ERA, and pitched fewer than 200 innings for the first time since 1919. From 1931 through 1933, Rixey pitched very little, and was used almost exclusively against the Pittsburgh Pirates. For the 1933 season, he was the only Reds pitcher with a winning record, at 6–3  as the Reds finished last in the National League at 58–94. He retired prior to the 1934 season, stating &quot;the manager wasn&#x27;t giving me enough work&quot;. Rixey completed his career with 266 wins, 251 losses, and a 3.15 ERA. He appeared in 692 games and completed 290, and had 20 wins and 14 saves as a relief pitcher.

Rixey was a better than average hitting pitcher, posting a .191 batting average (291-for-1,522) with 95 runs, 33 doubles, 3 home runs, 111 RBI and 49 bases on balls. He was also better than average defensively, recording a .978 fielding percentage which was 20 points higher than the league average at his position.

Bubbles Hargrave, former Cincinnati catcher, gave this testimonial: &quot;Eppa was just great. He was great as a pitcher, fielder and competitor. I look on him as the most outstanding player I came in contact with in my entire career.&quot; For his part, Rixey described his approach to the game in 1927 as follows: &quot;How dumb can the hitters in this league get? I&#x27;ve been doing this for fifteen years. When they&#x27;re batting with the count two balls and no strikes, or three and one, they&#x27;re always looking for the fastball and they never get it.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Originally Rixey had trouble controlling his speed, but eventually, weighing in at 210 pounds, he became one of the most feared pitchers in baseball. Rixey was considered a pitcher with a &quot;peculiar motion,&quot; who rarely walked a batter. Throughout his long career, Rixey charmed teammates and fans with his dry wit and big Southern drawl. His nonsensical nickname &quot;Jephtha&quot; seemed to capture his roots and amiable personality. Some writers thought &quot;Jephtha&quot; was a part of Rixey&#x27;s real name, but it was likely invented by a Philadelphia sportswriter. Rob Neyer called Rixey the fourth best pitcher in Reds history behind Bucky Walters, Paul Derringer and teammate Dolf Luque.

His 266 career victories stood as the record for most wins by a left-handed pitcher in the National League until Warren Spahn broke it in 1959; however, his 251 losses are an all-time record for left-handed pitchers. He also held the record for most seasons pitched by a National League left-hander until Steve Carlton broke it in 1986. As time passed, support for Rixey to be inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame grew. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958. In 1960, Rixey finished third in the balloting behind former teammate Edd Roush and Sam Rice (who was later inducted the same year as Rixey). Upon his election to the Hall of Fame on January 27, 1963, he was quoted as saying &quot;They&#x27;re really scraping the bottom of the barrel, aren&#x27;t they?&quot;

In 1969, he was named by Reds fans as the greatest left-handed pitcher in Reds history. The Reds Hall of Fame declared Rixey &quot;was the best left-hander ever to pitch for the Reds with a 179–148 record, 180 complete games, 23 shutouts and a 3.33 ERA in his 13 seasons.&quot;

In 1972 he was inducted into the first class of the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum.

In 2017 he was inducted into the inaugural class of the University of Virginia Baseball Hall of Fame:

Rixey&#x27;s childhood home in Culpeper still stands, although it suffered some damage in the 2011 Virginia earthquake.

== Personal life ==
Rixey was married to Dorothy Meyers of Cincinnati and had two children, Eppa Rixey III and Ann Rixey Sikes; and five grandchildren, James Rixey, Eppa Rixey IV, Steve Sikes, Paige Sikes, and David Sikes. After his retirement from baseball, Rixey worked for his father-in-law&#x27;s successful insurance company in Cincinnati, eventually becoming president of the company. He died of a heart attack on February 28, 1963, one month after his election to the Hall of Fame, becoming the first player to die between election and induction to the Hall of Fame. He is interred at Greenlawn Cemetery in Milford, Ohio.

When Rixey started playing, he was considered an &quot;anomaly.&quot; He came from a well-off family and was college-educated, something that was rare during his era. He wrote poetry, and earned masters degrees in chemistry and Latin. During the off-season, he was a Latin teacher at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He was also considered among the best golfers among athletes during the time period. Nonetheless, he was the target of hazing in his first few years in the major leagues. Eventually he teamed up with other college graduates Joe Oeschger and Stan Baumgartner and the hazing lessened to a degree.

<text>The International HapMap Project was an organization that aimed to develop a haplotype map (HapMap) of the human genome, to describe the common patterns of human genetic variation. HapMap is used to find genetic variants affecting health, disease and responses to drugs and environmental factors. The information produced by the project is made freely available for research.

The International HapMap Project is a collaboration among researchers at academic centers, non-profit biomedical research groups and private companies in Canada, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It officially started with a meeting on October 27 to 29, 2002, and was expected to take about three years. It comprises three phases; the complete data obtained in Phase I were published on 27 October 2005. The analysis of the Phase II dataset was published in October 2007. The Phase III dataset was released in spring 2009 and the publication presenting the final results published in September 2010.

== Background ==
Unlike with the rarer Mendelian diseases, combinations of different genes and the environment play a role in the development and progression of common diseases (such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke, depression, and asthma), or in the individual response to pharmacological agents. To find the genetic factors involved in these diseases, one could in principle do a genome-wide association study: obtain the complete genetic sequence of several individuals, some with the disease and some without, and then search for differences between the two sets of genomes. At the time, this approach was not feasible because of the cost of full genome sequencing. The HapMap project proposed a shortcut.

Although any two unrelated people share about 99.5% of their DNA sequence, their genomes differ at specific nucleotide locations. Such sites are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and each of the possible resulting gene forms is called an allele. The HapMap project focuses only on common SNPs, those where each allele occurs in at least 1% of the population.

Each person has two copies of all chromosomes, except the sex chromosomes in males. For each SNP, the combination of alleles a person has is called a genotype. Genotyping refers to uncovering what genotype a person has at a particular site. The HapMap project chose a sample of 269 individuals and selected several million well-defined SNPs, genotyped the individuals for these SNPs, and published the results.

The alleles of nearby SNPs on a single chromosome are correlated. Specifically, if the allele of one SNP for a given individual is known, the alleles of nearby SNPs can often be predicted, a process known as &quot;genotype imputation&quot;. This is because each SNP arose in evolutionary history as a single point mutation, and was then passed down on the chromosome surrounded by other, earlier, point mutations. SNPs that are separated by a large distance on the chromosome are typically not very well correlated, because recombination occurs in each generation and mixes the allele sequences of the two chromosomes. A sequence of consecutive alleles on a particular chromosome is known as a haplotype.

To find the genetic factors involved in a particular disease, one can proceed as follows. First a certain region of interest in the genome is identified, possibly from earlier inheritance studies. In this region one locates a set of tag SNPs from the HapMap data; these are SNPs that are very well correlated with all the other SNPs in the region. Using these, genotype imputation can be used to determine (impute) the other SNPs and thus the entire haplotype with high confidence. Next, one determines the genotype for these tag SNPs in several individuals, some with the disease and some without. By comparing the two groups, one determines the likely locations and haplotypes that are involved in the disease.

== Samples used ==

Haplotypes are generally shared between populations, but their frequency can differ widely. Four populations were selected for inclusion in the HapMap: 30 adult-and-both-parents Yoruba trios from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), 30 trios of Utah residents of northern and western European ancestry (CEU), 44 unrelated Japanese individuals from Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and 45 unrelated Han Chinese individuals from Beijing, China (CHB). Although the haplotypes revealed from these populations should be useful for studying many other populations, parallel studies are currently examining the usefulness of including additional populations in the project.

All samples were collected through a community engagement process with appropriate informed consent. The community engagement process was designed to identify and attempt to respond to culturally specific concerns and give participating communities input into the informed consent and sample collection processes.

In phase III, 11 global ancestry groups have been assembled: ASW (African ancestry in Southwest USA); CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection); CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China); CHD (Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado); GIH (Gujarati Indians in Houston, Texas); JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan); LWK (Luhya in Webuye, Kenya); MEX (Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California); MKK (Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya); TSI (Tuscans in Italy); YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria).

Three combined panels have also been created, which allow better identification of SNPs in groups outside the nine homogenous samples: CEU+TSI (Combined panel of Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection and Tuscans in Italy); JPT+CHB (Combined panel of Japanese in Tokyo, Japan and Han Chinese in Beijing, China) and JPT+CHB+CHD (Combined panel of Japanese in Tokyo, Japan, Han Chinese in Beijing, China and Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado). CEU+TSI, for instance, is a better model of UK British individuals than is CEU alone.

== Scientific strategy ==
It was expensive in the 1990s to sequence patients’ whole genomes. So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a &quot;shortcut&quot;, which was to look just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit. The theory behind the shortcut was that, since the major diseases are common, so too would be the genetic variants that caused them. Natural selection keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown, the theory held, but fails against variants that strike later in life, allowing them to become quite common (In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $138 million project called the HapMap to catalog the common variants in European, East Asian and African genomes).

For the Phase I, one common SNP was genotyped every 5,000 bases. Overall, more than one million SNPs were genotyped. The genotyping was carried out by 10 centres using five different genotyping technologies. Genotyping quality was assessed by using duplicate or related samples and by having periodic quality checks where centres had to genotype common sets of SNPs.

The Canadian team was led by Thomas J. Hudson at McGill University in Montreal and focused on chromosomes 2 and 4p. The Chinese team was led by Huanming Yang in Beijing and Shanghai, and Lap-Chee Tsui in Hong Kong and focused on chromosomes 3, 8p and 21. The Japanese team was led by Yusuke Nakamura at the University of Tokyo and focused on chromosomes 5, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 19. The British team was led by David R. Bentley at the Sanger Institute and focused on chromosomes 1, 6, 10, 13 and 20. There were four United States&#x27; genotyping centres: a team led by Mark Chee and Arnold Oliphant at Illumina Inc. in San Diego (studying chromosomes 8q, 9, 18q, 22 and X), a team led by David Altshuler and Mark Daly at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, USA (chromosomes 4q, 7q, 18p, Y and mitochondrion), a team led by Richard Gibbs at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston (chromosome 12), and a team led by Pui-Yan Kwok at the University of California, San Francisco (chromosome 7p).

To obtain enough SNPs to create the Map, the Consortium funded a large re-sequencing project to discover millions of additional SNPs. These were submitted to the public dbSNP database. As a result, by August 2006, the database included more than ten million SNPs, and more than 40% of them were known to be polymorphic. By comparison, at the start of the project, fewer than 3 million SNPs were identified, and no more than 10% of them were known to be polymorphic.

During Phase II, more than two million additional SNPs were genotyped throughout the genome by David R. Cox, Kelly A. Frazer and others at Perlegen Sciences and 500,000 by the company Affymetrix.

== Data access ==
All of the data generated by the project, including SNP frequencies, genotypes and haplotypes, were placed in the public domain and are available for download. This website also contains a genome browser which allows to find SNPs in any region of interest, their allele frequencies and their association to nearby SNPs. A tool that can determine tag SNPs for a given region of interest is also provided. These data can also be directly accessed from the widely used Haploview program.

<text>Cananga odorata, known as ylang-ylang ( ) or cananga tree, is a tropical tree that is native to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Queensland, Australia. It is also native to parts of Thailand and Vietnam. It is valued for the essential oils extracted from its flowers (also called &quot;ylang-ylang&quot;), which has a strong floral fragrance. Ylang-ylang is one of the most extensively used natural materials in the perfume industry, earning it the name &quot;Queen of Perfumes&quot;.

The climbing ylang-ylang vine, &quot;Artabotrys hexapetalus&quot; (synonym &quot;A. odoratissimus&quot;) is a woody, evergreen climbing plant in the same family, which is also a source of perfume.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The name &quot;ylang-ylang&quot; is the Spanish spelling of the Tagalog term for the tree, - a reduplicative form of the word , meaning &quot;wilderness&quot;, alluding to the tree&#x27;s natural habitat. A common mistranslation is &quot;flower of flowers&quot;.

The tree is also called the fragrant cananga, Macassar-oil plant, or perfume tree. It is called &quot;kenanga&quot; in Malay, from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *&quot;kanaŋa&quot;. Its traditional Polynesian names include &quot;mataoi&quot; (Cook Islands), &quot;mohokoi&quot; (Tonga), &quot;mosooi&quot; (Samoa), &quot;motooi&quot; (Hawaii), and &quot;mokosoi&quot;, &quot;mokasoi&quot; or &quot;mokohoi&quot; (Fiji). Other traditional names include &quot;sampangi&quot; (Telugu).

==Description==
&quot;Cananga odorata&quot; is a fast-growing tree of the custard apple family Annonaceae. Its growth exceeds per year, and it attains an average height of in an ideal climate. The compound evergreen leaves are pinnate, smooth and glossy, and long. Leaflets are oval, pointed and with wavy margins. The flower is drooping, long-stalked, with six narrow, greenish-yellow (rarely pink) petals, rather like a sea star in appearance, and yields a highly fragrant essential oil. Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.

&quot;Cananga odorata&quot; var. &quot;fruticosa&quot;, dwarf ylang-ylang, grows as small tree or compact shrub.

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant is native to Maritime Southeast Asia and Near Oceania, from the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Queensland, Australia. It is also native to parts of Thailand, and Vietnam. It has been introduced to other tropical regions in the Pacific Islands, South Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is commonly grown in Madagascar, Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and the Comoros Islands. It grows in full or partial sun, and prefers the acidic soils of its native rainforest habitat. Ylang-ylang has been cultivated in temperate climates under conservatory conditions.

In Madagascar, it is grown in plantations with &quot;Hewittia malabarica&quot; as a groundcover plant.

==Ecology==
Its clusters of black fruit are an important food item for birds, such as the collared imperial pigeon, purple-tailed imperial pigeon, Zoe&#x27;s imperial pigeon, superb fruit dove, pink-spotted fruit dove, coroneted fruit dove, orange-bellied fruit dove, and wompoo fruit dove. The Sulawesi red-knobbed hornbill serves as an effective seed disperser for &quot;C. odorata&quot;.

==Uses==

The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. It is believed to relieve high blood pressure and normalize sebum secretion for skin problems, and is considered to be an aphrodisiac. The oil from ylang-ylang is widely used in perfumery for oriental- or floral-themed perfumes (such as Chanel No. 5). Ylang-ylang blends well with most floral, fruit, and wood scents.

In Indonesia, ylang-ylang flowers are spread on the bed of newlywed couples. In the Philippines, its flowers, together with the flowers of the sampaguita, are strung into a necklace (&quot;lei&quot;) and worn by women and used to adorn religious images.

Ylang-ylang&#x27;s essential oil makes up 29% of the Comoros&#x27; annual export (1998).

Ylang-ylang is grown in Madagascar and exported globally for its essential oils.

Ylang-ylang essential oil is one of the basic ingredients of macassar oil.

==Ylang-ylang essential oil==

===Characteristics===
The fragrance of ylang-ylang is rich and deep with notes of rubber and custard, and bright with hints of jasmine and neroli, thus it is sometimes described as heavy, sweet, and carries a slightly fruity floral scent. The essential oil of the flower is obtained through steam distillation of the flowers and separated into different grades (extra, 1, 2, or 3) according to when the distillates are obtained. The main aromatic components of ylang-ylang oil are benzyl acetate, linalool, &quot;p&quot;-cresyl methyl ether, and methyl benzoate, responsible for its characteristic odor.

===Chemical constituents===
Typical chemical compositions of the various grades of ylang-ylang essential oil are reported as:

* Linalool
* Germacrene
* Geranyl acetate
* Caryophyllene
* &quot;p&quot;-Cresyl methyl ether
* Methyl benzoate
* Sesquiterpenes

<doc id="813075" wikidata="Q833860" url="?curid=813075" title="Maid">
<text>A maid, housemaid, or maidservant is a female domestic worker. In the Victorian era, domestic service was the second-largest category of employment in England and Wales, after agricultural work. In developed Western nations, full-time maids are now typically only found in the wealthiest households. In other parts of the world (mainly within the continent of Asia), maids remain common in urban middle-class households.

 in Middle English meant an unmarried woman, especially a young one, or specifically a virgin. These meanings lived on in English until recent times (and are still familiar from literature and folk music), alongside the sense of the word as a type of servant.

==Description==
Maids perform typical domestic chores such as laundry, ironing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for household pets. They may also take care of children, although there are more specific occupations for this, such as nanny. In some poor countries, maids take care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a uniform.

In the contemporary Western world, comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help, usually relying on cleaners, employed directly or through an agency (maid service). 
Many services historically provided by maids have been substituted with home appliances.

In less developed nations, various factors ensure a labour source for domestic work: very large differences in the income of urban and rural households, widespread poverty, fewer educated women, and limited opportunities for the employment of less educated women.

Legislation in many countries makes certain living conditions, working hours, or minimum wage a requirement of domestic service. Nonetheless, the work of a maid has always been hard, involving a full day, and extensive duties. Maids would be familiar with hard work and typically worked long hours in a week.

===Europe===
Maids were once part of an elaborate hierarchy in great houses, where the retinue of servants stretched up to the housekeeper and butler, responsible for female and male employees respectively. It was the best and most common way that women could earn money, especially lower class women. The word &quot;maid&quot; itself means an unmarried young woman or virgin. Domestic workers, particularly those low in the hierarchy, such as maids and footmen, were expected to remain unmarried while in service. They had their own section of rooms in the house, though they were far away from the other rooms and weren’t anywhere near as nice as the rest of the house.

Some households employed maids-of-all-work as young as twelve in the 19th century in England and they often worked from five in the morning until late in the evening on a wage of £6 to £9 per year. They had no free time and typically only had one or two days off in a month.

In Victorian England, all middle-class families would have &quot;help&quot;, but for most small households, this would be only one employee, the maid of all work, often known colloquially as &quot;the girl&quot;.

Historically, many maids suffered from prepatellar bursitis, an inflammation of the prepatellar bursa caused by long periods spent on the knees for purposes of scrubbing and fire-lighting, leading to the condition attracting the colloquial name of &quot;housemaid&#x27;s knee&quot;.

As the end of the nineteenth century neared, the relationship between employer and servant grew more and more distant and they were less loyal. At the end of the nineteenth century, there was a decline in the want for maids and other servants entirely, which has led to today when the majority of people don’t have maids.

===Asia===
Today, foreign women are employed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and United Arab Emirates in large numbers to work as maids or other roles of domestic service, and are often vulnerable to multiple forms of abuse. An &quot;ayi&quot; (&quot;aunt&quot; in Mandarin) works as a domestic helper in China, and occasionally provides personalized childcare.

==Southern Africa==
In some areas in the region, the word &quot;maid&quot; is avoided. This is most likely due to the fact that it sounds like a racially derogatory term in Afrikaans. Maids in South Africa were referred to as domestic servants and they included men, women, and children. They were subject to low wages, lack of a social life, unfavorable working conditions, and even unaccommodating work hours. The Afrikaans word for a mite (small arachnid) has been used demeaningly to refer to women of colour. The English word for a friend, &quot;mate&quot;, is also avoided for this reason.

==Types==

Maids traditionally have a fixed position in the hierarchy of the large households, and although there is overlap between definitions (dependent on the size of the household), the positions themselves would typically be rigidly adhered to. The usual classifications of maid in a large household are:

* Lady&#x27;s maid: a senior servant who reported directly to the lady of the house, but ranked beneath the housekeeper, and accompanied her lady on travel. She took care of her mistress&#x27;s clothes and hair, and sometimes served as confidante. 
* House-maid or housemaid: a generic term for maids whose function was chiefly &quot;above stairs&quot;, and were usually a little older, and better paid. Where a household included multiple housemaids, the roles were often subdivided as below.
** Head house-maid: the senior house maid, reporting to the housekeeper. (Also called &quot;house parlour maid&quot; in an establishment with only one or two upstairs maids).
** Parlour maid: they cleaned and tidied reception rooms and living areas by morning, and often served refreshments at afternoon tea, and sometimes also dinner. They tidied studies and libraries, and (with footmen) answered bells calling for service.
** Chamber maid: they cleaned and maintained the bedrooms, ensured fires were lit in fireplaces, and supplied hot water.
** Laundry maid: they maintained bedding and towels. They also washed, dried, and ironed clothes for the whole household, including the servants.
** Under house parlour maid: the general deputy to the house parlour maid in a small establishment that had only two upstairs maids.
* Nursery maid: also an &quot;upstairs maid&quot;, but one who worked in the children&#x27;s nursery, maintaining fires, cleanliness, and good order. Reported to the nanny rather than the housekeeper. The nursemaid would often stay with one family for years or as long as their services were needed.
* Kitchen maid: a &quot;below stairs&quot; maid who reported to the cook, and assisted in running the kitchens.
** Head kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed, the &quot;head kitchen maid&quot; was effectively a deputy to the cook, engaged largely in the plainer and simpler cooking (sometimes cooking the servants&#x27; meals).
** Under kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed, these were the staff who prepared vegetables, peeled potatoes, and assisted in presentation of finished cooking for serving.
* Scullery maid: the lowest grade of &quot;below stairs&quot; maid, reporting to the cook, the scullery maids were responsible for washing cutlery, crockery, and glassware, and scrubbing kitchen floors, as well as monitoring ovens while kitchen maids ate their own supper.
* Between maid, sometimes known as a &quot;tweeny&quot;: roughly equivalent in status to scullery maids, and often paid less, between maids in a large household waited on the senior servants (butler, housekeeper, and cook) and were therefore answerable to all three department heads, often leading to friction in their employment.
* Still room maid: a junior maid employed in the still room; as the work involved the supply of alcohol, cosmetics, medicines, and cooking ingredients across all departments of the house, the still room maids were part of the &quot;between staff&quot;, jointly answerable to all three department heads.

In more modest households, a single maid-of-all-work or skivvy was often the only staff. It is possible this word originates from the Italian for slave (&quot;&quot;—&quot;owned person&quot;).

==In popular culture==
One of the most in-depth and enduring representations of the lives of several types of maid was seen in the 1970s television drama &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, set in England between 1903 and 1936. The lives of maids were well represented in the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; series, set in England between 1912 and 1926 and shown from 2010 onward.

The American television drama &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;, set in the 1880s in New York City, depicts the lives of maids living and working in the great houses of the era.

The main characters in the NAMIC Vision Award-nominated television series &quot;Devious Maids&quot; are four housemaids.

<doc id="813086" wikidata="Q1256787" url="?curid=813086" title="Rotational frequency">
<text>Rotational frequency, also known as rotational speed or rate of rotation (symbols &quot;ν&quot;, lowercase Greek nu, and also &quot;n&quot;), is the frequency of rotation of an object around an axis.
Its SI unit is the reciprocal seconds (s−1); other common units of measurement include the hertz (Hz), cycles per second (cps), and revolutions per minute (rpm).

Rotational frequency can be obtained dividing &quot;angular frequency&quot;, ω, by a full turn (2π radians): &quot;ν&quot;ω/(2πrad).
It can also be formulated as the instantaneous rate of change of the number of rotations, &quot;N&quot;, with respect to time, &quot;t&quot;: &quot;n&quot;d&quot;N&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; (as per International System of Quantities).
Similar to ordinary period, the reciprocal of rotational frequency is the rotation period or period of rotation, &quot;T&quot;&quot;ν&quot;−1&quot;n&quot;−1, with dimension of time (SI unit seconds).

Rotational velocity is the vector quantity whose magnitude equals the scalar rotational speed. In the special cases of &quot;spin&quot; (around an axis internal to the body) and &quot;revolution&quot; (external axis), the rotation speed may be called spin speed and revolution speed, respectively.

Rotational acceleration is the rate of change of rotational velocity; it has dimension of squared reciprocal time and SI units of squared reciprocal seconds (s−2); thus, it is a normalized version of &quot;angular acceleration&quot; and it is analogous to &quot;chirpyness&quot;.

==Related quantities==
Tangential speed formula_1 (Latin letter v), rotational frequency formula_2, and radial distance formula_3, are related by the following equation:
formula_4

An algebraic rearrangement of this equation allows us to solve for rotational frequency:
formula_5

Thus, the tangential speed will be directly proportional to formula_3 when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same formula_7, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand. The direct proportionality of formula_1 to formula_3 is not valid for the planets, because the planets have different rotational frequencies.

==Regression analysis==
Rotational frequency can measure, for example, how fast a motor is running. &quot;Rotational speed&quot; is sometimes used to mean angular frequency rather than the quantity defined in this article. Angular frequency gives the change in angle per time unit, which is given with the unit radian per second in the SI system. Since 2π radians or 360 degrees correspond to a cycle, we can convert angular frequency to rotational frequency by
formula_10
where
* formula_11 is rotational frequency, with unit cycles per second
* formula_12 is angular frequency, with unit radian per second or degree per second

For example, a stepper motor might turn exactly one complete revolution each second.
Its angular frequency is 360 degrees per second (360°/s), or 2π radians per second (2π rad/s), while the rotational frequency is 60 rpm.

Rotational frequency is not to be confused with tangential speed, despite some relation between the two concepts. Imagine a merry-go-round with a constant rate of rotation. No matter how close to or far from the axis of rotation you stand, your rotational frequency will remain constant. However, your tangential speed does not remain constant. If you stand two meters from the axis of rotation, your tangential speed will be double the amount if you were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation.

<doc id="813129" wikidata="Q120624" url="?curid=813129" title="Psi Factor">
<text>Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal is a Canadian science fiction drama television series which was filmed in and around Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and aired 88 episodes over four seasons from 1996 to 2000. In 1996, Christopher Chacon and Peter Aykroyd co-created the show.

==Plot==

The series was hosted by Peter Aykroyd&#x27;s brother Dan Aykroyd, who presents dramatic stories inspired by the paranormal investigations of the &quot;Office of Scientific Investigation and Research&quot; (O.S.I.R.).

=== Season one ===

The first season introduces members of the O.S.I.R. team, including case managers Conner Doyle (Paul Miller) and Curtis Rollins (Maurice Dean Wint), senior data analyst Lindsay Donner (Nancy Anne Sakovich), physicist Peter Axon (Barclay Hope), Dr. Anton Hendricks (Colin Fox) as well as various other investigators that rotate with each new case. The first season uses elements that are later dropped in subsequent seasons, most notably featuring two unlinked cases per episode. The first season features more of a documentary-style look including hand-held cameras and on-screen interviews with the &quot;experiencers&quot;. In the first-season finale, &quot;Perestroika&quot;, case manager Conner Doyle is killed in an explosion in an attempt to save the team and to kill a deadly parasite.

=== Season two ===

Starting with the second season, actors Paul Miller and Maurice Dean Wint are removed from the opening credits and Matt Frewer joins the cast as the new case manager, Matt Praeger. Michael Moriarty joins the cast in the recurring role of Michael Kelly, a conspiracy theorist who is friends with Praeger. The series now focuses on one case per episode and is structured more like a one-hour drama series. The second season features more character development as well as story arcs. After a limited role in the first season, Director of Operations Frank Elsinger (Nigel Bennett) becomes a more prominent presence and is often believed to have a hidden agenda, mostly by Matt Praeger who questions many of his decisions. Michael Kelly causes problems for Elsinger, as he often involves himself in various O.S.I.R. cases and tries to expose the truth. In the second-season finale, &quot;The Egress&quot; (part one of a three-part story arc where the team discovers &quot;The Egress&quot;, an arch in which you disappear if you step inside), Curtis Rollins returns after being absent since near the end of the first season. Dr. Anton Hendricks is lured into the arch at the sight of his missing wife and daughter, and he disappears. The team is in conflict at the end of the season, as Praeger learns Lindsay has betrayed him by leaking information, meant to expose Elsinger&#x27;s questionable ethical activity. Praeger offers his resignation, and Elsinger offers Peter Axon the case manager position.

=== Season three ===

Starting with the third season, Nigel Bennett and Peter MacNeill as Frank Elsinger and Ray Donahue respectively are added to the opening credits, after having guest roles throughout the first two seasons. Peter Axon and Curtis Rollins continue investigating the Arch and try to get Anton back. As Peter convinces Lindsay to come back to the team, Praegar also returns to the team. Anton eventually comes back from the Arch and is in the hospital in critical condition. It&#x27;s revealed that Anton&#x27;s wife, believed to be dead, comes back from the Arch as well. The return of Nicole Hendricks solves a 12-year-old case in which Anton&#x27;s wife and daughter disappeared after a car crash. In the two-part third-season finale, &quot;Forever and a Day&quot;, Michael Kelley returns and informs the team of The Chairman, a mysterious figure who is believed to be evil and immortal and control a series of interlocking companies, including Veritec, Tessler Industries and the O.S.I.R. They then begin a secret case in which they discover the identity of The Chairman and exorcise the demon. The end of the third season marks the final appearances of many original characters, including Curtis Rollins, Frank Elsinger, Ray Donahue, Lennox Q. Cooper, and Michael Kelly.

=== Season four ===

Starting with the fourth season, Nigel Bennett and Peter MacNeill are removed from the opening credits, while Soo Garay as Dr. Claire Davison is added to the opening credits, after having guest roles throughout the first three seasons. Joanne Vannicola joins the main cast as Mia Stone. With Elsinger apparently gone, Anton Hendricks has taken over the role of Director of Operations and very rarely takes part in the investigations over the course of the season. Hendricks enforces rotating case manager, leading Peter, Lindsay and Mia to take on the case manager position for different cases. In the fifth episode of the season, &quot;883&quot;, Matt Praeger is infected with a virus which will lead to his death. The team soon discovers a secret project where a doctor is planning on colonizing a new world. Praeger learns the only way he could live is if he goes to the new world. After agreeing, he shares a tearful goodbye with his daughter Dana as well as the rest of the O.S.I.R. team and leaves a goodbye tape. Beginning with the following episode, Matt Frewer is removed from the opening credits and Nancy Anne Sakovich receives first billing. In episode 18 of the season, &quot;Regeneration&quot;, presumed dead Conner Doyle returns and reveals he was pulled out of the building before it exploded and then spent three years in Siberia where he was held prisoner in a research facility in order to study an alien parasite that he had contracted during the original mission. He returns to aid the team in which they investigate &quot;Project Regeneration&quot;, where a genetically altered female has the ability to heal herself, but with alien DNA that will take over and make her violent. Lindsay finds out that her cells were used to create Lilith, and that she retains all of Lindsay&#x27;s memories. Conner suggests a plasma transfusion where Lindsay&#x27;s cells could be introduced into Lilith to enhance her human side. During the transfusion, it&#x27;s revealed Lilith is pregnant, Conner has alien DNA, and he is trying to save their alien child. Peter and Anton release a toxic gas into the secured lab, killing Conner and Lilith. In the fourth season finale, &quot;Stone Dreams&quot;, we learn Mia Stone has been subject to a secret experiment conducted by Anton Hendricks when she first arrived to the O.S.I.R. The experiment aims to determine the impact of paranormal investigation on the investigator. Anton tests the technology on Mia, which will enable them to access the images that are seen with the inner eye. During the test, Anton hypnotizes Mia and gets her to remember past events that then are reflected on the monitor. As the test gets more intense, her heart rate increases and her brainwave functions becomes erratic and all the glass in the lab explodes. The last scene of the episode shows Mia first meeting Anton and accepting to be a part of the experiment. It&#x27;s unknown if Mia died or not as a result of the experiment.

== Criticism ==
In 1997, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry presented the &quot;Snuffed Candle Award&quot; to Dan Aykroyd (in absentia) for hosting Psi Factor and being a &quot;long-time promoter ... of paranormal claims&quot;. Following the awards, CSI fellow Joe Nickell wrote to Aykroyd asking for the research behind the &quot;cases&quot; presented on Psi Factor, particularly a claim that NASA scientists were &quot;killed while investigating a meteor crash and giant eggs were found and incubated, yielding a flea the size of a hog&quot;.

<text>An AI takeover is an imagined scenario in which artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and computer programs or robots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species, which relies on human intelligence. Possible scenarios include replacement of the entire human workforce due to automation, takeover by an artificial superintelligence (ASI), and the notion of a robot uprising. Stories of AI takeovers have been popular throughout science fiction, but recent advancements have made the threat more real. Some public figures, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, have advocated research into precautionary measures to ensure future superintelligent machines remain under human control.

== Types ==
=== Automation of the economy ===
The traditional consensus among economists has been that technological progress does not cause long-term unemployment. However, recent innovation in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence has raised worries that human labor will become obsolete, leaving some people in various sectors without jobs to earn a living, leading to an economic crisis. Many small and medium size businesses may also be driven out of business if they cannot afford or licence the latest robotic and AI technology, and may need to focus on areas or services that cannot easily be replaced for continued viability in the face of such technology.

==== Technologies that may displace workers ====
AI technologies have been widely adopted in recent years. While these technologies have replaced some traditional workers, they also create new opportunities. Industries that are most susceptible to AI takeover include transportation, retail, and military. AI military technologies, for example, allow soldiers to work remotely without risk of injury. A study in 2024 highlights AI&#x27;s ability to perform routine and repetitive tasks poses significant risks of job displacement, especially in sectors like manufacturing and administrative support. Author Dave Bond argues that as AI technologies continue to develop and expand, the relationship between humans and robots will change; they will become closely integrated in several aspects of life. AI will likely displace some workers while creating opportunities for new jobs in other sectors, especially in fields where tasks are repeatable.

==== Computer-integrated manufacturing ====
Computer-integrated manufacturing uses computers to control the production process. This allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions. Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.

==== White-collar machines ====
The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research, and journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.

==== Autonomous cars ====

An autonomous car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017, automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who at a moment&#x27;s notice can take control of the vehicle. Among the obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles are concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry. On March 18, 2018, the first human was killed by an autonomous vehicle in Tempe, Arizona by an Uber self-driving car.

==== AI-generated content ====

The use of automated content has become relevant since the technological advancements in artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. In most cases, AI-generated content such as imagery, literature, and music are produced through text prompts and these AI models have been integrated into other creative programs. Artists are threatened by displacement from AI-generated content due to these models sampling from other creative works, producing results sometimes indiscernible to those of man-made content. This complication has become widespread enough to where other artists and programmers are creating software and utility programs to retaliate against these text-to-image models from giving accurate outputs. While some industries in the economy benefit from artificial intelligence through new jobs, this issue does not create new jobs and threatens replacement entirely. It has made public headlines in the media recently: In February 2024, Willy&#x27;s Chocolate Experience in Glasgow, Scotland was an infamous children&#x27;s event in which the imagery and scripts were created using artificial intelligence models to the dismay of children, parents, and actors involved. There is an ongoing lawsuit placed against OpenAI from The New York Times where it is claimed that there is copyright infringement due to the sampling methods their artificial intelligence models use for their outputs.

=== Eradication ===
Scientists such as Stephen Hawking are confident that superhuman artificial intelligence is physically possible, stating &quot;there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains&quot;. Scholars like Nick Bostrom debate how far off superhuman intelligence is, and whether it poses a risk to mankind. According to Bostrom, a superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same &quot;emotional&quot; desire to collect power that often drives human beings but might rather treat power as a means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources and help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine&#x27;s plans. As an oversimplified example, a paperclip maximizer designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world&#x27;s resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.

== In fiction ==

AI takeover is a common theme in science fiction. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers&#x27; concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing its goals. The idea is seen in Karel Čapek&#x27;s &quot;R.U.R.&quot;, which introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; in 1921, and can be glimpsed in Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants his monster&#x27;s request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.

According to Toby Ord, the idea that an AI takeover requires robots is a misconception driven by the media and Hollywood. He argues that the most damaging humans in history were not physically the strongest, but that they used words instead to convince people and gain control of large parts of the world. He writes that a &quot;sufficiently&quot; intelligent AI with an access to the internet could scatter backup copies of itself, gather financial and human resources (via cyberattacks or blackmails), persuade people on a large scale, and exploit societal vulnerabilities that are too subtle for humans to anticipate.

The word &quot;robot&quot; from &quot;R.U.R.&quot; comes from the Czech word, &quot;robota&quot;, meaning laborer or serf. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured &quot;robots&quot; with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt. HAL 9000 (1968) and the original Terminator (1984) are two iconic examples of hostile AI in pop culture.

== Contributing factors ==
=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===
Nick Bostrom and others have expressed concern that an AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence. If its self-reprogramming leads to getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive intelligence explosion in which it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind. Bostrom defines a superintelligence as &quot;any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest&quot;, and enumerates some advantages a superintelligence would have if it chose to compete against humans:

* Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology 
* Strategizing: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition
* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support, or covertly incite a war between humans
* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems
* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans

==== Sources of AI advantage ====
According to Bostrom, a computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that runs algorithms that are as powerful as the human brain&#x27;s algorithms, could still become a &quot;speed superintelligence&quot; if it can think orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200 Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000 Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120 m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.

A network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a &quot;collective superintelligence&quot;.

More broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a &quot;quality superintelligence&quot;, perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above apes. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints, while the number of processors in a supercomputer can be indefinitely expanded. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on working memory, and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies&#x27; source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.

=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===

==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====

A significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not undergo instrumental convergence in ways that may automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.

The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI&#x27;s motivations human-friendly. Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI&#x27;s utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not &quot;common sense&quot;. According to Eliezer Yudkowsky, there is little reason to suppose that an artificially designed mind would have such an adaptation.

==== Odds of conflict ====
Many scholars, including evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker, argue that a superintelligent machine is likely to coexist peacefully with humans.

The fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity&#x27;s history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being&#x27;s goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal. According to AI researcher Steve Omohundro, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity&#x27;s evolutionary context) would be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources—would that create goals of self-preservation? AI&#x27;s goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.

Many scholars dispute the likelihood of unanticipated cybernetic revolt as depicted in science fiction such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, arguing that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it. Pinker acknowledges the possibility of deliberate &quot;bad actors&quot;, but states that in the absence of bad actors, unanticipated accidents are not a significant threat; Pinker argues that a culture of engineering safety will prevent AI researchers from accidentally unleashing malign superintelligence. In contrast, Yudkowsky argues that humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their goals are unintentionally incompatible with human survival or well-being (as in the film &quot;I, Robot&quot; and in the short story &quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot;). Omohundro suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow utility functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.

==== Precautions ====

The AI control problem is the issue of how to build a superintelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. Some scholars argue that solutions to the control problem might also find applications in existing non-superintelligent AI. 

Major approaches to the control problem include &quot;alignment&quot;, which aims to align AI goal systems with human values, and &quot;capability control&quot;, which aims to reduce an AI system&#x27;s capacity to harm humans or gain control. An example of &quot;capability control&quot; is to research whether a superintelligence AI could be successfully confined in an &quot;AI box&quot;. According to Bostrom, such capability control proposals are not reliable or sufficient to solve the control problem in the long term, but may potentially act as valuable supplements to alignment efforts.

== Warnings ==
Physicist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could &quot;spell the end of the human race&quot;. Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that &quot;Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.&quot; Hawking believed that in the coming decades, AI could offer &quot;incalculable benefits and risks&quot; such as &quot;technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand.&quot; In January 2015, Nick Bostrom joined Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark, Elon Musk, Lord Martin Rees, Jaan Tallinn, and numerous AI researchers in signing the Future of Life Institute&#x27;s open letter speaking to the potential risks and benefits associated with artificial intelligence. The signatories &quot;believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today.&quot;

Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s Odyssey series and Charles Stross&#x27;s Accelerando relate to humanity&#x27;s narcissistic injuries in the face of powerful artificial intelligences threatening humanity&#x27;s self-perception.

<text>Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application developed by Adobe Inc.; it is used for animation and in the post-production process of film making, video games and television production. Among other things, After Effects can be used for keying, tracking, compositing, and animation. It also functions as a very basic non-linear editor, audio editor, and media transcoder. In 2019, the program won an Academy Award for scientific and technical achievement.

==History==
After Effects was originally created by David Herbstman, David Simons, Daniel Wilk, David M. Cotter, and Russell Belfer at the Company of Science and Art in Providence, Rhode Island. The first two versions of the software, 1.0 (January 1993) and 1.1, were released there by the company. CoSA, whose CEO was William J. O&#x27;Farrell. CoSA with After Effects was acquired by Aldus Corporation in July 1993, which in turn was acquired by Adobe in 1994. Adobe acquired PageMaker as well. Adobe&#x27;s first new release of After Effects was version 3.0.

==Third-party integrations==

After Effects functionality can be extended through a variety of third-party integrations, the most common integrations are: plug-ins, scripts, and extensions.

===Plug-ins===

Plug-ins are predominantly written in C or C++ and extend the functionality of After Effects, allowing for more advanced features such as particle systems, physics engines, 3D effects, and the ability to bridge the gap between After Effects and another application.

===Scripts===

After Effects Scripts are a series of commands written in both JavaScript and the ExtendScript language.

After Effects Scripts, unlike plug-ins, can only access the core functionality of After Effects.
Scripts are often developed to automate repetitive tasks, to simplify complex After Effects features, or to perform complex calculations that would otherwise take a long time to complete.

Scripts can also use some functionality not directly exposed through the graphical user interface.

===Extensions===

After Effects Extensions offer the ability to extend After Effects functionality through modern web development technologies like HTML5, and Node.js, without the need for C++.

After Effects Extensions make use of Adobe&#x27;s Common Extensibility Platform or CEP Panels, which means they can be built to interact with other Adobe CC apps.

<doc id="813224" wikidata="Q610057" url="?curid=813224" title="Dedan Kimathi">
<text>Dedan Kimathi Waciuri (born Kimathi wa Waciuri; 31 October 1920 – 18 February 1957) was the leader of the Kenya Land and Freedom Army during the Mau Mau Uprising (1952–1960) against the British colonial rule in Kenya in the 1950s. He was captured by the British in 1956 and executed in 1957. Kenya gained independence in 1963. Kimathi is credited with leading efforts to create formal military structures within the Mau Mau, and convening a war council in 1953. He, along with Baimungi M&#x27;marete, Musa Mwariama, Kubu Kubu, General China and Muthoni Kirima, was one of the Field Marshals.

Kenyan nationalists view him as a freedom fighter in the Kenyan struggle for independence, while the British colonial authorities saw him as a terrorist. Despite being viewed negatively by Kenya&#x27;s first two presidents, Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi, Kimathi and his fellow Mau Mau rebels were officially recognised as heroes in the struggle for Kenyan independence under the Mwai Kibaki administration, culminating in the unveiling of a Kimathi statue in 2007. This was reinforced by the passage of a new Constitution in 2010 calling for recognition of national heroes.

==Early life==
Kimathi was born in Thegenge Village, Tetu division, in today&#x27;s Nyeri County. His father died in September 1920, a month before Kimathi was born. Kimathi was raised by his mother, Waibuthi, one of his father&#x27;s three wives. He had two brothers, Wambararia and Wagura, and two sisters. At the age of fifteen, he enrolled at the local primary school, Karuna-ini, where he perfected his English. He continued his education in the secondary school Tumutumu CMS School. He was a passionate writer, and wrote extensively before and during the Mau Mau uprising. He was a Debate Club member in his school and also showed ability in poetry. Kimathi balked at any efforts to discipline or control him, and was constantly in trouble with his teachers; as a result, he drifted in and out of the educational system. Tumutumu could not contain his rebellious nature. It is alleged he even tried to paralyze learning at the institution by stealing the school bell. His associates said he took the bell and rang it loudly while atop the Tumutumu hill. The missionaries were however lenient, his name still remains in the preserved school register. In 1940, Kimathi enlisted in the British Army, but was discharged after a month, allegedly for drunkenness and persistent violence against his fellow recruits. He moved from job to job, from swineherd to primary school teacher, from which he was dismissed after accusations of violence against his pupils. His close associates however said he was dismissed for ranting about the school administration.

==Mau Mau movement==

Around 1947 or 1948, while working in Ol Kalou, Kimathi came into contact with members of the Kenya African Union (KAU). By 1950 he had become secretary to the KAU branch at Ol Kalou, which was controlled by militant supporters of the Mau Mau cause. The Mau Mau began as the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), a militant Kikuyu, Embu and Meru army which sought to reclaim land, which the British settlers had gradually stripped away from them. As the group&#x27;s influence and membership widened it became a major threat to the colonial government.

Upon taking the oath of the Mau Mau, Kimathi in 1951 joined the Forty Group, the militant wing of the defunct Kikuyu Central Association. As branch secretary, Kimathi presided over oath-taking. He believed in compelling fellow Kikuyu by way of oath to bring solidarity to the independence movement. To achieve this he administered beatings and carried a double-barrelled shotgun. His activities with the group made him a target of the colonial government, and he was briefly arrested that same year but escaped with the help of local police. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the uprising, and he formed the Kenya Defence Council to co-ordinate all forest fighters in 1953.

== Capture and execution ==
Kimathi&#x27;s fight for an independent Kenya came to an end in 1956. On 21 October of that year, Ian Henderson, a British colonial police officer who had been on an &quot;obsessive hunt&quot; for Kimathi, managed to trap him in his hide-out in the forest. Kimathi was shot in the leg and captured by a Tribal Policeman called Ndirangu Mau who found Kimathi armed with a panga (a bladed African tool like a machete). His capture marked the beginning of the end of the forest war; the image of Kimathi being carried away on a stretcher was printed in leaflets by the British (over 120,000 were distributed), to demoralise the Mau Mau and their supporters. Kimathi was charged with possession of a .38 Webley Scott revolver.

A court presided over by Chief Justice O&#x27;Connor with three African assessors sentenced him to death while he lay in a hospital bed at the General Hospital Nyeri. His appeal was dismissed, and the death sentence upheld.

The day before his execution, he wrote a letter to a Father Marino asking him to get his son an education: &quot;He is far from many of your schools, but I trust that something must be done to see that he starts earlier under your care.&quot; He also wrote about his wife, Mukami, saying &quot;She is detained at Kamiti Prison and I suggest that she will be released some time. I would like her to be comforted by sisters e.g. Sister Modester, etc. for she too feels lonely. And if by any possibility she can be near the mission as near Mathari so that she may be so close to the sisters and to the church.&quot;

He asked to see his wife, and the morning of the execution Mukami was allowed to see Kimathi. The two chatted for close to two hours. He told her that &quot;I have no doubt in my mind that the British are determined to execute me. I have committed no crime. My only crime is that I am a Kenyan revolutionary who led a liberation army... Now If I must leave you and my family I have nothing to regret about. My blood will water the tree of Independence.&quot;

In the early morning of 18 February 1957 he was executed by hanging at the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. He was buried in an unmarked grave, and his burial site remained unknown for 62 years until 25 October 2019 when the Dedan Kimathi Foundation reported that the grave-site had been identified at the Kamiti Prison grounds.

==Personal life==
Kimathi was married to Mukami Kimathi. Among their children are sons Wachiuri and Maina and daughters Nyambura, Waceke, Wangeci, Nyakinyua Nyawira, Muthoni, Wangui and Wanjugu. The government constructed a three-bedroomed house for Mukami at her farm in Kinangop, Nyandarua County in 2009 and provided her with a double cabin pickup for private use in 2012. In 2010, Kimathi&#x27;s widow requested that the search for her husband&#x27;s body be renewed so she could give him a proper burial. Mukami Kimathi died on 4 or 5 May 2023 and was buried in Njabini Kinangop.

== Legacy ==

===Official registration of the Mau Mau===
On 11 November 2003, the Kibaki government formally registered the Mau Mau movement, disregarding the colonial-era legislation that had outlawed the organisation and branded its members &quot;terrorists&quot;. In his remarks during the handing over of the certificate, Vice President Moody Awori regretted that it had taken 40 years for the group to be officially registered despite the sacrifices the Mau Mau had made for Kenya&#x27;s independence.

===The Dedan Kimathi statue===
The Kibaki government erected a 2.1 metre bronze statue titled Freedom Fighter Dedan Kimathi on a graphite plinth, in central Nairobi. The statue is at the junction of Kimathi Street and Mama Ngina Street. Kimathi, clad in military regalia, holds a rifle in the right hand and a dagger in the left, the last weapons he held in his struggle. The foundation stone for the statue was laid by Vice President Awori on 11 December 2006 and the completed statue unveiled by President Kibaki on 18 February 2007 coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the day he was executed. In his remarks, Kibaki paid homage to Kimathi as a man who not only paid the ultimate price for Kenya&#x27;s liberation but also inspired others to fight against oppression.

The statue attracted praise from Kenyans as a long overdue recognition of the Mau Mau for their part in the struggle for independence. This was in marked contrast to the post-colonial norm of the Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Arap Moi governments&#x27; regard of the Mau Mau as terrorists.

On 12 September 2015, the British government unveiled a Mau Mau memorial statue in Nairobi&#x27;s Uhuru Park that it funded &quot;as a symbol of reconciliation between the British government, the Mau Mau, and all those who suffered&quot;. This followed a June 2013 decision by Britain to compensate more than 5,000 Kenyans tortured and abused during the Mau Mau insurgency.

===Nelson Mandela===
Kimathi was held in high regard by anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. In July 1990, five months after his release from 27 years of imprisonment by South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime, Mandela visited Nairobi and requested to see Kimathi&#x27;s grave and meet his widow Mukami. Mandela&#x27;s request was an embarrassing moment for the Moi administration, which had largely ignored Kimathi, like Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s government before it. It was an awkward moment searching for her in the village where she and her family lived forgotten in poverty. Mandela&#x27;s request was not met. During a public address at the Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi before he left the country, Mandela stated his admiration for Kimathi, Musa Mwariama, Waruhiu Itote, Kubu Kubu and other Mau Mau leaders who inspired his own struggle against injustice. It was only 15 years later in 2005, during his second visit to Kenya, that Mandela finally managed to meet Mukami as well as two of Kimathi&#x27;s children.

Mandela&#x27;s respect for Kimathi by the early 1960s is also alluded to in &quot;My Moment with a Legend&quot; by Ronnie Kasrils, the former intelligence chief of the ANC&#x27;s armed wing Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) and defence minister in Mandela&#x27;s government.

<text>De/Vision is a German synth-pop musical group formed in 1988. The band started as a quartet consisting of Thomas Adam, Steffen Keth, Stefan Blender, and Markus Ganssert. Blender left the band in 1991 and Ganssert departed in 2000. The name De/Vision is a play on words. The majority of the band&#x27;s lyrics are in English, but they have had some songs in German.

In 2000, Keth started a side project as the vocalist with Green Court, called &#x27;Green Court featuring De/Vision&#x27;. The band with remaining members Keth and Adam were then signed to Drakkar Records and Sony BMG in Europe, and Dancing Ferret Discs in North America. The band is currently signed to Metropolis Records in North America. Since 1994 the band has released a new studio album of original material roughly every 1.5 years, until their 2012 album &quot;Rockets and Swords&quot;.

In 2009, the band started their own label, Popgefahr, primarily to release their own works as a response to the difficulty of garnering label support.

On 25 May 2018, the single &quot;They Won&#x27;t Silence Us&quot; was released, and on 22 June, the new studio album &quot;Citybeats&quot; was released by the band. The LP was supported by a tour that started on 21 April 2018 and ended on 2 February 2019.

<text>Meredith Ann Baxter (born June 21, 1947) is an American actress and producer. She is known for her roles on the CBS sitcom &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot; (1972–1973), ABC drama series &quot;Family&quot; (1976–1980) and the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1982–1989). A five-time Emmy Award nominee, one of her nominations was for playing the title role in the 1992 TV film &quot;A Woman Scorned: The Betty Broderick Story&quot;.

== Early life ==
Baxter was born on June 21, 1947, in South Pasadena, California, the daughter of actress, director and producer Whitney Blake and Tom Baxter, a radio announcer. After her parents were divorced in 1953, Baxter and her two brothers, Richard (born 1944) and Brian (born 1946), were raised by their mother in Pasadena. Her second stepfather was situation comedy writer Allan Manings.

Baxter was educated at James Monroe High School before transferring to Hollywood High School. During her senior year, she attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a voice major, but returned to Hollywood High, where she graduated in 1965.

== Career ==
Baxter got her first appearance in television in 1967 on Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-in, followed by The Interns, The Young Lawyers, The Doris Day Show, and Insight and in 1971 on an episode of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; in its second season. She later appeared in 1972 as one of the stars of &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;, a CBS television network situation comedy. The series was canceled after one season. Her co-star, David Birney, became her second husband in 1974. Until they were divorced in 1989, she was credited as &quot;Meredith Baxter Birney&quot;, under which name she became widely known in 1976 on &quot;Family&quot;. She played the role of Nancy Lawrence Maitland and received two Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (1977 and 1978). In 1976 she played the wife of White House staffer Hugh W. Sloan Jr. in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.
After &quot;Family&quot; ended, she starred with Annette O&#x27;Toole and Shelley Hack in &quot;Vanities&quot; (1981), a television production of the comedy-drama stage play about the lives, loves and friendship of three Texas cheerleaders starting from high school to post-college graduation; it aired as a part of &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, a series on the premium television channel HBO.

In 1982, Baxter landed the role of Elyse Keaton, the former flower child matriarch of the Keaton family on the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;. In 1986, during her time on &quot;Family Ties&quot;, Baxter earned critical acclaim for her dramatic performance as Kate Stark in the NBC television film &quot;Kate&#x27;s Secret&quot;, about a seemingly &quot;perfect&quot; suburban housewife and mother who is secretly suffering from bulimia nervosa. Following &quot;Family Ties&quot;, Baxter produced and starred in television films. She portrayed a psychopathic kidnapper in &quot;The Kissing Place&quot; (1990) and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special for her work in &quot;A Woman Scorned: The Betty Broderick Story&quot; (1992), based on the true story of Betty Broderick, a divorcée who was convicted of murder in the shooting of her ex-husband and his young wife. For her work on the television film &quot;My Breast&quot; (1994), she received a special award for public awareness from the National Breast Cancer Coalition. In 1997, Baxter once again played the mother of a character played by Michael J. Fox (who portrayed her son, Alex P. Keaton, on &quot;Family Ties&quot;), this time in two episodes of &quot;Spin City&quot;.

In 2005, she began appearing in television commercials for Garden State Life Insurance Company. In 2006, she temporarily co-hosted—with Matt Lauer—&quot;Today&quot;, the NBC morning news and talk show. In 2007, she made a guest appearance on &quot;What About Brian&quot;, an ABC drama series. That same year, she also made several appearances as the dying mother of Detective Lilly Rush in &quot;Cold Case&quot;, a CBS police procedural series. In recent years, Baxter created a skin care line called Meredith Baxter Simple Works, which raises funds for Baxter&#x27;s breast cancer research foundation.

Baxter was the guest speaker at the 2008 Southern Commencement for National University in La Jolla, California, and was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from the university.

On March 1, 2011, Baxter&#x27;s memoir, titled &quot;Untied&quot;, was published. In the book, she details her early life, her unhappy and in some cases abusive marriages, her struggles with and recovery from alcoholism, and her realization that she is a lesbian. The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

She is also a spokesperson for the senior mobile service provider Consumer Cellular. She voiced the character &quot;Elise Sr.&quot; in &quot;Dan Vs.&quot;. In April 2013, it was announced that Baxter would be in the season 4 finale episode of &quot;Glee&quot;, along with Patty Duke, as a mentor to Darren Criss&#x27;s character Blaine Anderson and Chris Colfer&#x27;s character, Kurt Hummel. She also made a guest appearance on the ABC Family/Freeform series &quot;Switched at Birth&quot; as the widowed mother of Kathryn Kennish (portrayed by Lea Thompson).

On August 4, 2014, producers announced that Baxter would be joining &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Maureen, Nikki Newman&#x27;s new drinking buddy, a &quot;charming, intelligent, middle-class woman who has always aspired to a more privileged life than she has had&quot;. Baxter started appearing on the program on September 8. She also played the mother to &quot;Stich&quot; Raybourne and Kelly Andrews.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===
Baxter has been married four times and has five children.

* Robert Lewis Bush (1966–1971, divorce); two children, born 1967 and 1969
* David Birney (1974–1989, divorce); three children, born 1974, and twins, born 1984
* Michael Blodgett (1995–2000, divorce)
* Nancy Locke (2013–present)

On December 2, 2009, she came out as a lesbian during an interview with Matt Lauer on &quot;Today&quot; and on the &quot;Frank DeCaro Show&quot; on Sirius-XM OutQ 102. She said that accepting her sexual orientation helped her understand why, in part, previous relationships with men had failed.

On March 1, 2011, while promoting a memoir, Baxter alleged that ex-husband David Birney had emotionally and physically abused her. Birney denied the allegations. ABC News reported that:

Meredith Baxter says in a new book, &quot;Untied&quot;, that she was a victim of emotional and physical abuse... [by] then-husband David Birney, who denied the allegations... Baxter alleges that Birney hit her more than once... She writes that she coped with the marital violence by drinking heavily, but has been sober since 1990 (the year after she and Birney divorced).

The day after Baxter discussed Birney on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, she traveled to Chicago to appear on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; for further discussion of the topics covered in her memoir. Winfrey&#x27;s staff had arranged for &quot;Family Ties&quot; co-star Michael Gross to surprise Baxter on camera. Gross confirmed the assumption that Baxter had made throughout their seven years of working on the sitcom, that no one connected with the series had known or suspected that Baxter&#x27;s husband was abusing her at the time. Gross was affectionate with Baxter on camera and expressed sorrow that she had endured such an ordeal for so long. Birney vehemently denied the claims that he had abused Baxter.

=== Diet ===
Baxter is a vegetarian.

=== Health issues ===
Baxter was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1999. After treatment, she made a full recovery.
