<doc id="839154" wikidata="Q1067533" url="?curid=839154" title="Major professional tennis tournaments before the Open Era">
<text>Before the advent of the Open era of tennis competitions in April 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in established tournaments, including the four majors. There was no prize money and players were compensated for travel expenses only. However many top tennis players turned professional to play legally for prize money in the years before the open era. They played in separate professional events, mostly on tours involving head-to-head competition, but also in professional tournaments as the biggest events on the pro tour. Professional tournaments, in particular the professional majors, usually only had a men&#x27;s draw.

== Professional majors ==
In addition to the head-to-head tours, there were also major pro events, where the world&#x27;s top professional male players often played. These tournaments held with a certain tradition and longevity. According to Ellsworth Vines, &quot;the Wembley tournament in London..., the U.S. professional championship, and to some extent the tournament in Paris were the major professional tournaments prior to 1968.&quot;

The oldest of these three tournaments was the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, played at a variety of different venues and on a variety of different surfaces, between 1927 and 1999. The Wembley Championship, played between 1934 and 1990 at the Wembley Arena in the United Kingdom, was played on a wood surface through 1967. The third professional major was the French Pro Championship, where between 1930 and 1968 it was played on both clay and wood courts. A player who won all three in a calendar year was considered in retrospect by later tennis writers to achieve a &quot;Professional Grand Slam&quot;, or &quot;Pro Slam&quot;.

In some years, professional tournaments other than the pro majors had stronger fields and offered more prize money. Jack Kramer designated the four major professional tournaments for the 1958/1959 seasons as follows; Forest Hills, Kooyong, L.A. Masters, Sydney.

===U.S. Pro Tennis Championships===
The U.S. Pro Tennis Championship, also known as the US Pro, and officially known as the Cleveland International Pro or Cleveland World Pro Tennis Championships between 1951 and 1962, was an annual tournament, later known as MFS Pro Championships. It was first organized by player Vincent Richards when promoter C. C. Pyle withdrew interest in the project. It was first played on the Notlek courts located at 119th Street and Riverside Drive, Manhattan. The tournament was held at various locations in several states until 1964, when it moved to the Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In both 1951 and 1954 there are two U.S. Pro tournaments listed here for each year.

===French Pro Championship===
The French Pro Championship was first held in 1930, held by the &quot;Association Française des Professeurs de Tennis (AFPT)&quot;, entitled &quot;Championnat International de France Professionnel&quot; (French Pro Championships) on June 18–22, 1930. From 1930 the French Pro Championship was always played at Paris, on outdoor clay at Roland Garros except from 1963 to 1967 where it was held at Stade Pierre de Coubertin on indoor wood.

===Wembley Championship===

The Wembley Championship, also known as the Wembley Pro, was held at the Wembley Arena, in London. This professional event ran from 1934 to 1967 and was originally played on a wood surface placed over the top of a drained pool. It was officially known as the &quot;London Indoor Professional Championships&quot; from 1951 through 1967.

==Other important tournaments==
The Championships at Wimbledon, the U.S. Championships, the French Championships, and the Australian Championships were typically the top events, where amateur players could compete for the title, albeit without prize money. Since the professional circuit was less organized and somewhat less popular than the amateur circuit, the professional events hierarchy changed each year. In 1934 the U.S. Pro was a high-class tournament with all top ranked pro players whereas in 1936 it was a meeting between pro teachers without any leading pro players. A tournament could even be canceled at any time due to poor attendance.

Consequently, for a given year a pro tournament was important when it attracted the best pro players and then another year this same tournament could be a second-rank tournament because few or no leading players came. Before the open era in addition to numerous small tournaments and head-to-head tours between the leading professionals, there were some major tournaments which stood out at different periods. Some survived sporadically because of financial collapses while others temporarily rose to the highest levels of competition when other tournaments weren&#x27;t held. These include:

===Bristol Cup: 1920–1932===

Sometimes labelled &quot;Professional Championships of France&quot; this tournament was held on the French Riviera at Menton, at Cannes.

===Professional Championship of the World: 1927–1928===

This event was held in October on clay courts, at the Queen&#x27;s Club in London. In 1928 Myers of the Daily Telegraph wrote that &quot;this was the best pro tournament ever held in England.&quot;

List of Queen&#x27;s Club Pro winners:
===World Pro Championship: 1932–1933===

The World Pro Championship were held in 1932 and 1933 in Berlin at the Rot-Weiss club, on clay. It had a very large participation (over 80 players). According to Ray Bowers, the tournament at the time was regarded as the most prestigious professional tournament in the world.

List of World Pro winners:
===Bonnardel Cup: 1935–1937===
This was a team tournament created by Bill Tilden and modeled on the Davis Cup format. In 1935, early rounds in France were hoped to be played at Roland Garros, but the French Tennis Association would not allow the event to be played at the stadium.

===International Pro Championship of Britain: 1935–1939===

The International Pro Championship of Britain (also known as the Southport Pro, as well as the Southport Dunlop Cup for sponsorship purposes) was a professional tennis tournament held at Victoria Park in Southport between 1935 and 1939. It was open to professional players only, amateurs were not allowed to compete. The tournament was held on outdoor En-tout-cas, &quot;all-weather&quot; artificial clay.

===U.S. Pro Hard Courts: 1945–1946===
In LA; the only significant pro tournament of the last year of World War II, although missing Frank Kovacs and Welby Van Horn.

===Philadelphia U.S. Pro Indoor: 1950–1952 ===
===Australian Pro: 1954===

The Australian Pro was a men&#x27;s professional tournament held in 1954 and it was billed as the Australian Professional Championships.

===Tournament of Champions: 1957–1959===

The Tournament of Champions was a prominent professional tennis tournament series between 1957 and 1959. The tournament was held on the grass-courts of Forest Hills, New York, between 1957 and 1959, and an Australian version of the Tournament of Champions was held on grass at White City, Sydney in 1957 and 1959, and at Kooyong Stadium in Melbourne in 1958. The 1957 and 1958 Forest Hills tournaments had a round robin format, while the 1959 Forest Hills was an elimination tournament with 10 players. The Sydney version was an elimination event, while the 1958 Kooyong event was a round robin format.

The 1957 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions was broadcast live nationally in the U.S.A. on the CBS television network in its entirety, the only known professional tennis tournament in the U.S.A. to achieve this status before the Open Era. (The CBS Dallas pro tennis tournament in 1965 was filmed and broadcast one match at a time in a weekly series.) The 1959 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions offered the largest winners&#x27; cheques of the year. The current designation by the West Side Tennis Club of the 1957–59 Forest Hills TOC is &quot;WCT Tournament of Champions&quot;. Kramer&#x27;s contemporary brochures described the Ampol series, of which the 1959 Forest Hills TOC was a part, with the term &quot;World Championship Tennis&quot;.

The 1958 Kooyong Tournament of Champions was the richest tournament of the series, with a prize money of 10,000 Australian pounds (US$24,000).

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-11 (; NATO reporting name: &quot;Moose&quot;) is a trainer aircraft used by the Soviet Air Force and other Soviet-influenced air forces from 1947 until 1962.

==Design and development==
The Yakovlev design bureau began work on an advanced trainer based on the Yak-3 fighter in mid-1944, although the trainer was of low priority owing to the ongoing Second World War. The first prototype of the new trainer, designated Yak-UTI or Yak-3UTI flew in late 1945. It was based on the radial-powered Yak-3U, but with the new Shvetsov ASh-21 seven-cylinder radial replacing the ASh-82 of the Yak-3U. It used the same all-metal wings as the Yak-3U, with a fuselage of mixed metal and wood construction. The pilot and observer sat in tandem under a long canopy with separate sliding hoods. A single synchronised UBS 12.7 mm machine gun and wing racks for two 100 kg (220 lb) bombs comprised the aircraft&#x27;s armament.
An improved prototype flew in 1946, with revised cockpits and a modified engine installation with the engine mounted on shock absorbing mounts. This aircraft passed state testing in October 1946, with production beginning at factories in Saratov and Leningrad in 1947.

Production Yak-11s were heavier than the prototypes, with later batches fitted with non-retractable tailwheels and revised propellers. A 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun was sometimes fitted instead of the UBS, while some were fitted with rear-view periscopes above the windscreen. Soviet production totalled 3,859 aircraft between 1947 and 1955, with a further 707 licence-built by Let in Czechoslovakia as the C-11.

=== Yak-11U ===
In 1951, Yakovlev revised the design of the Yak-11, adding a retractable tricycle landing gear, with two variants proposed, the Yak-11U basic trainer and Yak-11T proficiency trainer, which carried equipment similar to contemporary jet fighters. The new aircraft had reduced fuel capacity and was unsuitable for operations on rough or snow-covered runways, and so was rejected for Soviet service, although a few units were built in Czechoslovakia as the C-11U.

==Operational history==

The Yak-11 entered service in 1947, serving as a standard advanced trainer with the Soviet Air Forces and DOSAAF. Both the Yak-11 and C-11 were used in all Warsaw Pact countries and were exported to eighteen countries, including many African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries.

Egyptians used the aircraft extensively during their intervention in the Yemeni Civil war. Egyptian aircraft were modified with Sakr 78mm unguided rockets and two .303in guns in the wings. and were used in the ground attack role. 

North Korean Yak-11s were used in combat in the Korean War, with one Yak-11 being the first North Korean aircraft shot down by US forces when it was destroyed by a North American F-82 Twin Mustang over Kimpo Airfield on 27 June 1950. East Germany used the Yak-11 to intercept American reconnaissance balloons.
==Surviving aircraft==

Due to its Yak-3 lineage, the Yak-11 has recently seen widespread popularity among warbird enthusiasts. Highly modified versions of the Yak-11 are often seen at air races. About 120 Yak-11s remain airworthy.

<doc id="839164" wikidata="Q2298952" url="?curid=839164" title="Gainford, County Durham">
<text>Gainford or Gainford on Tees is a village on the north bank of the River Tees in County Durham, England. It is half-way between Barnard Castle and Darlington, near Winston, at OS map reference NZ 1716.

==History==
In Anglo-Saxon times, Gainford was the centre of an estate, part of the Northumbrian Congregation of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. Later, this area was occupied by Vikings. Archaeologists have found Viking sculptures at Gainford and several examples of these have been put on display in the &quot;Open Treasure&quot; exhibition at Durham Cathedral. Many sculptures found at Gainford show both Northumbrian and Viking influence. Despite the Viking settlement, Northumbrian Angles remained major landowners along the banks of the Tees in Viking times.

In the nineteenth century Gainford village had its own spa. Today its main features are an unspoilt village green, a Jacobean hall and a Georgian street called High Row. The village church of St Mary&#x27;s, Gainford, stands on the site of an Anglo-Saxon monastery built by Bishop Ecgred of Lindisfarne in the early 9th century.

In 1904 the family of a deceased Joseph Edleston owned a plot of land next to the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s in Gainford. The children asked to erect a monument in the churchyard in memory of Joseph&#x27;s 41-year tenure at the church. The church refused permission, asserting that the churchyard was full, but that the family could donate their land to the church and then build a monument on part of it. Feeling slighted, the family immediately set about building themselves a house on their land with a 40-foot column erected next to the churchyard so it towered over the trees and pointed a huge V-sign in stone towards the church authorities. The Edleston Spite House is still standing and occupied and has MCMIV (1904) over the front door. While the 40-foot column is still standing, the &#x27;V&#x27; sign is now gone.

==House styles==
The houses around the green are mostly Georgian with some rubble-built houses on the north and south sides of the green. When they were built, the rubble-built houses would have been rendered, but the present fashion is to reveal the stonework with the rendering removed. Roofs are mostly red pantiles, and tend to be finished with a line of split-stone along the eaves. Some of the larger buildings have blue slate roofs, the slate probably brought by the railway. The older cottages in the village have steep pitched roofs in a style that suggests earlier heather thatching.

==Village cross==
Torwards the western end of the village green, there is a stone cross on a square base. The base is thought to be medieval in origin, but the cross itself is Victorian. It is dated 1897 and commemorates Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The Cross was made by Isaac Charge and Son, of Gainford. The cross has a slightly battered shaft and Saxon-type head. There is an inscription on the west face of the shaft which states: &quot;In thankful commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the accession of Queen Victoria on June 20th 1897. This cross was re-erected and trees planted on the green by the inhabitants of Gainford&quot;.

==Notable residents==
The geographer Charles Bungay Fawcett (1883 – 1952), regarded as &quot;one of the founders of modern British academic geography&quot; and an early promoter of the idea of regional planning. was educated at the school in Gainford.

<text>The Kawasaki Ki-100 (キ100) is a single-seat single-engine monoplane fighter aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) during World War II. The Japanese Army designation was . It was not assigned an Allied code name.

In early 1945, 275 Ki-100s were modified from Ki-61s as an emergency measure to accept a 14-cylinder Mitsubishi Ha-112-II radial engine in place of the original Kawasaki Ha-40 inverted V-12 inline engine, resulting in one of the best interceptors used by the Army during the war. It combined excellent power and maneuverability, and from the first operational missions in March 1945 until the end of the war, it performed better than most IJAAS fighters against both United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers and P-51 Mustang fighters, as well as U.S. Navy F6F Hellcat carrier fighters.

A newly built variant, the Ki-100-Ib, was produced with a cut down rear fuselage during the last months of the war which equipped five home defence &quot;sentai&quot;. High-altitude performance was further improved with the final variant, the Ki-100-II, however only three of these were produced before the war ended and this final variant never saw operational service.

==Design and development==
The Ki-100 was a stressed-skin cantilever low-wing single-seat enclosed-cockpit radial engine monoplane fighter with retractable undercarriage. Control surfaces were fabric covered.

===Ki-61 engine problems===
In mid-1944, the Ki-61 was one of the best fighters of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS). It was also the only production Japanese fighter to have an inline powerplant, the V-12 Kawasaki Ha-40, a Japanese adaptation of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine, as well as one of the first with factory-installed armor and self-sealing fuel tanks. It also had a respectable performance, in line with contemporary American designs, with speed and rate of climb emphasized instead of manoeuvrability and range. It was an effective design, but suffered from engine shortages and reliability problems. These problems led to the development of an improved model, the Ki-61-II (later Ki-61-II-KAI), powered by the improved Kawasaki Ha-140 inverted V-12 engine, which was heavier than the Ha-40 it replaced. Maximum speed increased from and aside from the rate of climb, general performance was improved as well. However, it never performed as expected due to continued quality control problems with the engine, while far fewer engines were produced than required.

===Ha-112 radial engine===
At this point of the war, the IJAAS was in desperate need of effective interceptors to stop bombing raids over the Japanese mainland, so in October 1944 a decision was made to use the Mitsubishi Ha-112-II (&quot;Kinsei&quot; [&quot;Venus&quot;] 60 series), a 14-cylinder, two-row radial engine. The need for a new engine became urgent on 19 January 1945, when a bombing raid destroyed the Ha-140 production plant, leaving 275 otherwise complete Ki-61s engineless.
The Mitsubishi Ha-112-II was lighter than the Ha-140 and developed the same power but with much greater reliability. Three Ki-61-II-KAIs were modified to carry this engine as prototypes. Chief engineer Takeo Doi with two other engineers redesigned the Ki-61 airframe to accept the new engine. Their solution was to use a second skin to form a fairing riveted to the fuselage to smooth out the airflow behind the cooling flaps and multiple exhaust stubs of the new engine cowling. As this engine was lighter, they were able to remove the lead counterweight in the tail that balanced out the heavier Ha-140 engine.

The new model was flown for the first time on 1 February 1945. Without the need for the heavy coolant radiator and other fittings required for a liquid-cooled engine, the Ki-100 was lighter than the Ki-61-II, reducing the wing loading from 189 kg/m2 (38.8 lb/ft2) to 175 kg/m2 (35.8 lb/ft2). This had a positive effect on the flight characteristics, enhancing landing and takeoff qualities as well as improving manoeuvrability and reducing the turning radius. During March and April 1945, experienced instructors from the Akeno Army Flying School flew the Ki-100 in extensive tests against the Ki-84, which was the best IJAAS fighter then in operational service. Their conclusions were that, given pilots of equal experience, the Ki-100 would always win in combat.

The flight characteristics of the plane surpassed the &quot;Hien″s&quot; in all but maximum speed, which was reduced by by the larger cross sectional area of the radial engine, and the model was ordered into production as the &quot;Goshikisen&quot; (&quot;Go&quot;=five; &quot;shiki&quot;=type; &quot;sentoki&quot;=fighter) or &quot;Army Fighter Type 5&quot;. The company&#x27;s designation for it was Ki-100-I-Ko. All Ki-100-I-Ko were converted from existing Ki-61-II Kai and Ki-61-III airframes. The integral engine mount and cowling was cut off and a tubular steel engine mount was bolted to the firewall. Some redundant fittings from the liquid-cooled engine, such as the radiator shutter actuator, were left in place. The first 271 aircraft with the original faired rear fuselage were rolled out of the factory between March and June 1945.

In contrast to the unreliable engines used by the Kawanishi N1K-J, Kawasaki Ki-61 and Nakajima Ki-84 that were keeping many of these aircraft grounded, the new engine was much more reliable. Although its maximum speed in level flight was a bit slow for 1945, the Ki-100 could dive with North American P-51 Mustangs and maintain speed after pullout, unlike most Japanese fighters.
Two remaining problems continued to hamper Japanese fighters towards the end of the war, these being unreliable electrical systems and poor radio equipment, and while the latter was never resolved, the Ki-100&#x27;s electrical system was less of a problem than with other types.

The armament remained the same as was used on the Ki-61, which was two
cowl-mounted calibre Ho-5 cannons, with 200 rounds per gun complemented by two wing-mounted Ho-103 machine guns with 250 rounds per gun.

===Fuselage improvements===
The Ki-100-I-Otsu were newly built as such, rather than being conversions, with a cut-down rear fuselage and improved canopy, and 118 were produced from May through to the end of July 1945. This version also featured a modified oil cooler under the engine in a more streamlined fairing.
===High altitude improvements===
The Ki-100-II was fitted with a turbocharged water-methanol injected engine for improved high-altitude performance, mainly to improve interception capabilities against the Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, but only three prototypes were built; none was used operationally. Due to a lack of space, no intercooler was installed. However, performance was still enhanced above .

==Operational history==
The Ki-100 made its combat debut on the night of 9 March 1945 and suffered its first loss a month later on the night of 7 April 1945, when a single Ki-100 of the &quot;18th Sentai&quot; was downed by a B-29 Superfortress after &quot;attacking the formation again and again&quot;. Allied aircrews soon realised that they were facing a formidable new fighter. Although far fewer Ki-100s were available than Nakajima Ki-84s, it was an important fighter in the Army&#x27;s inventory. A well-handled Ki-100 was able to outmanoeuvre any American fighter, including the P-51D Mustangs and Republic P-47N Thunderbolts, which escorted the B-29s over Japan, and was comparable in speed, especially at medium altitudes. The Ki-100 was a tough opponent in the hands of an experienced pilot. The Ki-100, along with the Army&#x27;s Nakajima Ki-84 and the Navy&#x27;s Kawanishi N1K-J, were equal to the latest Allied types in the final year of the Pacific War.

Army fighter units equipped with this model included the 5th, 17th, 18th, 20th, 59th, 111th, 112th, 200th, and 244th &quot;Sentai&quot; and the 81st Independent Fighter Company. Pilots were trained at the Akeno and Hitachi (Mito) Army Flying Schools. Many Akeno and Hitachi instructors were from operational units and, between training sorties, they also flew combat missions, making the most of the few fighters that were operational, but these wings were only partially re-equipped.
During interception of high-flying B-29 Superfortresses (before the B-29s switched to low-level missions), the new fighters struggled, as the engine&#x27;s performance still dropped off at high altitudes. The most effective strategy against the B-29 Superfortress remained the exceedingly dangerous head-on attack, which left the fighter relatively stationary in the sights of the bomber&#x27;s defensive guns, making it an easy target. In this type of combat, the Navy&#x27;s Mitsubishi J2M &quot;Raiden&quot; remained superior.

111th &quot;Sentai&quot; Ki-100s intercepted B-29 Superfortresses attacking Kobe on 5 June 1945, claiming six bombers shot down and five &#x27;probables&#x27;. The Americans recorded a loss of nine B-29s, including those downed by Ki-100s over the target area. Ki-100s of the same unit joined by 244th &quot;Sentai&quot; Ki-84s in a large-scale engagement against 21st Fighter Group and 506th Fighter Group P-51 Mustangs over Nagoya Bay on 16 July 1945. The Ki-100 pilots claimed six P-51s, and, in return, five Ki-100s were lost with three pilots killed, although American records only show one loss.

On 25 July 1945, 18 244th &quot;Sentai&quot; Ki-100 fighters clashed with 10 VF-31 Grumman F6F Hellcats from the light aircraft carrier in an air battle where the Ki-100 pilots claimed twelve victories with two losses. Claims and counter-claims for this action remain contentious. The Americans claimed two Ki-100s and admitted to losing two VF-31 F6F-5 Hellcats. These include a Ki-100 and a Hellcat which collided, killing both pilots.

After the bombing of the Kagamigahara plant and the slow deliveries of components by satellite plants, the production rate of the Ki-100 declined, and, between May and July, only twelve were delivered. Bombing ended production - with only 118 of the Army Type 5 Fighter Model 1b having been delivered.

The final flights made by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service were made by two Ki-100s ferried from Komachi to Yokosuka, where they were handed over to the United States, who then shipped them back to the US for evaluation.

==Surviving aircraft==

* Kawasaki Ki-100-1b s/n 8476M was captured at Tân Sơn Nhứt Airfield, Saigon, in August 1945 in airworthy condition, having only recently been delivered. However it was damaged there on 26 Nov 1945 during a wheels-up landing, after the undercarriage failed to lower for an attempted landing at Biên Hòa airfield, 15 miles away; it was being ferried there by a Japanese pilot for flight tests. The oil cooler, propeller, and tailwheel were repaired but not returned to complete airworthy condition; it was later shipped to the United Kingdom along with three other Japanese aircraft including a Mitsubishi A6M Zero (Zeke) fuselage, a Mitsubishi Ki-46 (Dinah) and a Nippon Kokusai Ki-86 (Cyprus). After years of being in storage in various locations, and being misidentified as a Nakajima Ki-43 (Oscar), it was restored and placed on display at the Royal Air Force Museum London on the former Hendon Aerodrome in the London Borough of Barnet, UK. It was moved to RAF Museum Cosford on 30 January 2012, though it was again at the RAF Museum London as of December 2024.

<doc id="839177" wikidata="Q5432480" url="?curid=839177" title="Falls Festival">
<text>Falls Music &amp; Arts Festival (commonly known as Falls) is a multi-day music festival held annually in Byron Bay (New South Wales) and Fremantle (Western Australia), Australia over the New Year&#x27;s Eve and January period. The festival hosts contemporary music performances, dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other art forms. Camping is available and all locations have nearby beaches which are either walking distance or a short bus ride away. 
Artists playing at the festival include rock, hip-hop, indie music, electronic music, blues and roots.

The Festival was previously held in Lorne, Victoria from its inception until 2018, Marion Bay, Tasmania between 2003 and 2019 and Melbourne, Victoria in 2022.

The Falls Festival in Byron Bay features a rave party hidden behind a washing machine in a laundromat.

==History==

The festival started in 1993, with a small one-day concert, held in Lorne, Victoria, Australia, and was named Rock Above The Falls. The initial event attracted nearly 11,000 people, exceeding the organisers&#x27; expectations, and the organisers negotiated the use of neighbouring land to accommodate the crowd.

In 1995, the event adopted a two-day format, and in 1996 the name was changed to &quot;The Falls Music &amp; Arts Festival&quot;. The 1999 festival was the first to be held off the Lorne site, moved temporarily to the Torquay site of the Offshore Festival due to poor weather.

Two events were held simultaneously for the first time in 2003; one in Lorne, and an additional event at Marion Bay, Tasmania. The same acts played at both events; the 30 December acts who played at Lorne, play 31 December at Marion Bay, and vice versa. Both the Lorne and Marion Bay festivals have continued to run simultaneously and artists continue to be exchanged between the two locations over the course of the festival. Subsequent festivals retained this two-location format.

The Byron edition of the event was introduced in 2013, increasing the reach of the festival across the country. 

In 2019, the festival at the Lorne site was cancelled due to extreme bushfire risk during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season. All editions of the festivals in 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, with organisers citing interstate travel restrictions. 

In 2021, the Marion Bay edition of the festival was cancelled permanently, with organisers citing low revenue from the event. In March 2023, Secret Sounds, the organisers of the festivals, placed the 273 hectare Marion Bay property that hosted the Tasmanian festival on the market, to be sold under expressions of interest.

In 2022, the Victorian edition of the festival was held at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in inner city Melbourne, after originally being planned for the town of Murroon, located 35 km from Lorne. Organisers of the Festival pulled out of the planning process after a small local group opposed the planning permit approval.

The festival will not run in 2023 as the organisers decided to take the year off.

==Awards==
In 2008, the Falls Festival won the FasterLouder Festival Award for &#x27;Best Lineup&#x27; and the following year the Marion Bay site received the &#x27;Favourite Venue and Location&#x27; award.

The festival has a strong focus on sustainability, taking home the following awards over the past few years:
*Winner – Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2012
*Winner – Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2013
*Winner – Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2014 (inducted into the Hall of Fame)

In 2005 tickets for the Marion Bay festival sold out two and a half days after going on sale on 15 August, and Lorne tickets selling out one week after coming on sale.

Further allocations of tickets for both festivals were released during December and sold out within hours of coming on sale. An unlimited number of Falls Festival patrons were able to attend the &#x27;Falls Cinema&#x27; on Thursday 29 December (one day earlier than the official kick-off) in an effort to minimize traffic congestion. In Tasmania, the number of tickets available were capped at 9000.

===2006===

In early July, a new website for the 2006 event was launched. People were able to subscribe to the official mailing list and be entered into the draw to be offered tickets ahead of the official release date of 16 August. Subscribers that were selected were notified by 30 July.
Tickets for the 2006 festival were put on sale as of 9 am, 16 August. All tickets to the Lorne event were gone in about 2 hours. The Marion Bay event followed suit, with all tickets sold out within 3.5 hours.

The announced performers as of 28 December, include:
*Modest Mouse
*Michael Franti and Spearhead
*Wolfmother
*Basement Jaxx
*The Bees

Restrictions on ticket sales were made in 2006 (in the form of a ballot) in an attempt to curb the increasing practice of ticket resale, commonly known as &#x27;scalping&#x27;, as well as to make the access to tickets more equitable. The changes reflected similar alterations made to ticket sale procedures of other major Australian music festivals such as Splendour in the Grass and The Big Day Out. Previously, tickets had been released for sale in bulk and with no limit on the number of tickets able to be purchased by an individual, resulting in a high incidence of individuals purchasing multiple tickets, and a subsequent sell-out of tickets within 12 – 24 hours.

The restrictions included a purchasing limit of four tickets per any individual, as well as the initiation of an online ticket lottery, which randomly allocated the sale of approximately 50% of all tickets to a list of people who had registered their interest on the Festival&#x27;s website. Tickets were also released on multiple dates rather than in bulk, to make sales more manageable and to increase consumer accessibility to the sale of tickets.

*the centralisation of all ticket sales to the Falls Festival Website – intended to eliminate the need to line up outside stores overnight to purchase a ticket, as well as prevent criminal problems associated with it such as littering and drinking in public
*the inclusion of a name and date of birth printed on the Festival ticket – intended to further restrict scalping practices

Tickets went on sale to the general public on Monday 10 September at 9 am AEST, with the 14,500 tickets to the Lorne event selling out on the day they were released.

On 6 August 2009 some of the bands scheduled to play at the 2009 Falls Festival were leaked online due to a directory being left open on the official falls festival website. The organisers subsequently decided to officially release the entire first line-up announcement ahead of the scheduled 13 August release date.

On 7 October 2009 the Falls Festival announced that they would be putting on a pre-festival party, and extending the Falls Funk’n’Soul Revue to Lorne on 28 December. The extension of the revue made the Lorne festival a four-day event from 28 December to 1 January. The Funk’n’Soul Revue occurred over two days across the respective states, on the 28th in Lorne and on the 29th in Marion Bay with slightly differing lineups across the two locations.

<doc id="839178" wikidata="Q971694" url="?curid=839178" title="U.S.A. (trilogy)">
<text>The U.S.A. trilogy is a series of three novels by American writer John Dos Passos, comprising the novels &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; (1930), &quot;Nineteen Nineteen&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Big Money&quot; (1936). The books were first published together in a volume titled &quot;U.S.A.&quot; by Modern Library in 1937.

The trilogy employs an experimental technique, incorporating four narrative modes: fictional narratives telling the life stories of twelve characters, collages of newspaper clippings and song lyrics labeled &quot;Newsreel&quot;, individually labeled short biographies of public figures of the time such as Woodrow Wilson and Henry Ford and fragments of autobiographical stream of consciousness writing labeled &quot;Camera Eye&quot;. The trilogy covers the historical development of American society during the first three decades of the 20th century. In 1998, the US publisher Modern Library ranked &quot;U.S.A.&quot; 23rd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

== Structure ==

=== Narrative ===
In the fictional narrative sections, the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy relates the lives of twelve characters as they struggle to find a place in American society during the early part of the 20th century. Each character is presented to the reader from his/her childhood on and in free indirect speech. While their lives are separate, characters occasionally meet. Some minor characters whose point of view is never given crop up in the background, forming a kind of bridge between the characters.

=== The Camera Eye ===
&quot;The Camera Eye&quot; sections are written in stream of consciousness and are an autobiographical &quot;Künstlerroman&quot; of Dos Passos, tracing the author&#x27;s development from a child to a politically committed writer. Camera Eye 50 contains the arguably most famous line of the trilogy, when Dos Passos states upon the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti: &quot;all right we are two nations.&quot;

=== Newsreel ===
The &quot;Newsreel&quot; sections consist of front page headlines and article fragments from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; for &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot;, and from the &quot;New York World&quot; for &quot;Nineteen Nineteen&quot; and &quot;The Big Money&quot;, as well as lyrics from popular songs. Newsreel 66, preceding Camera Eye 50, announcing the Sacco and Vanzetti verdict, contains the lyrics of &quot;The Internationale. There are 68 newsreel sections of the whole novel, spread evenly. They rarely extend beyond one or two pages, their impact is thematic as much as it is grounding and sentimental. 

=== Biographies ===
The biographies are accounts of historical figures. The most often anthologized of these biographies is &quot;The Body of an American&quot;, the story of an unknown soldier killed in World War I, which concludes &quot;Nineteen Nineteen&quot;.

== Main characters ==
* Mac (Fainy McCreary) – A wandering printer, train-hopping newspaperman, and crusader for the working man
* Janey Williams – A young stenographer from Washington, D.C. (assistant to Moorehouse)
* Eleanor Stoddard – A cold, haughty young social climber
* J. Ward Moorehouse – A slick, influential public relations man
* Charley Anderson – A gullible, good-natured mechanic and flying ace
* Joe Williams – A rugged, slow-witted sailor, brother of Janey Williams
* Richard Ellsworth Savage – A Harvard graduate, employee of Moorehouse
* Daughter (Anne Elizabeth Trent) – A spirited Texas belle and volunteer nurse
* Eveline Hutchins – Artist and designer, Eleanor&#x27;s long-time friend and rival
* Ben Compton – A law student and labor activist/revolutionary
* Mary French – Dedicated labor activist and journalist
* Margo Dowling – Attractive, cagey and adventurous, eventually a Hollywood actress

== Analysis ==
=== Criticism ===
In his contemporary commentary on &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Nineteen&quot;, Michael Gold noted their qualities as extensions of Dos Passos&#x27; techniques in his earlier novel &quot;Manhattan Transfer&quot;, and described these novels as &quot;one of the first collective novels&quot;. Stanley Corkin  has specifically expostulated &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; in the context of readings of Hegelian Marxism with respect to the particular historical time of the novel. Arnold Goldman has commented on the &quot;progressive disenfranchisement&quot; of Dos Passos from 20th century America in the trilogy. Justin Edwards has discussed the use of cinematic techniques in &quot;The Big Money&quot;. Donald Pizer has discoursed in detail on the passage &#x27;only words against POWER SUPERPOWER&#x27; in &quot;The Big Money&quot;.

Janet Galligani Casey has analysed Dos Passos&#x27; treatment and development of the growth of his female characters in the trilogy. Stephen Lock has examined the cinematic ideas behind Dos Passos&#x27; use of the &#x27;Camera Eye&#x27; sections.

=== Style ===
The separation between these narrative modes is rather a stylistic than a thematic one. Some critics have pointed out connections between the fictional character Mary French in &quot;The Big Money&quot; and journalist Mary Heaton Vorse, calling into question the strict separation between fictional characters and biographies. Coherent quotes from newspaper articles are often woven into the biographies as well, calling into question the strict separation between them and the &quot;Newsreel&quot; sections.

The first and last newsreels in each of the three books within &quot;U.S.A.&quot; tend to mirror each other, for instance, &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; begins with declarations that the 20th century will be shaped by America and its territorial expansion, juxtaposed to British struggles in the Boer War and dead soldiers in the Philippines. &quot;Nineteen Nineteen&quot; begins with an embrace of American capitalism following European exhaustion and turmoil after the First World War, and ends with descriptions of the Red Summer and Knoxville riot. Meanwhile &quot;The Big Money&quot; presents different sides of American capitalism, beginning with &#x27;normalcy&#x27; and ending with the Wall Street Crash.

The fragmented narrative style of the trilogy later influenced the work of British science-fiction novelist John Brunner. It also influenced Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s trilogy &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;.

=== Political context ===
The trilogy was written in the period when Dos Passos placed himself unequivocally on the political Left, before the major political shift which characterized his later career. Dos Passos portrays the everyday situations of the characters before, during, and after World War I, with special attention to the social and economic forces that drive them. Those characters who pursue &quot;the big money&quot; without scruple succeed, but are dehumanized by success. Others are destroyed, crushed by capitalism, and ground underfoot. Dos Passos does not show much sympathy for upwardly mobile characters who succeed, but is always sympathetic to the down and out victims of capitalist society. He explores the difficulty faced by winners and losers alike when trying to make a stable living for themselves as well as wanting to settle down in some means. The book depicts with considerable sympathy the activists of the Industrial Workers of the World. It is more reserved with regard to the American Communist Party which took the fore in the American Radical Left after World War I; though some Communists are depicted sympathetically, they are shown as caught up in the increasing bureaucratization of the party. The book expresses an obvious animosity to President Woodrow Wilson, depicting in detail his suppression of internal dissent during and immediately after World War I.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted a number of times, for purposes such as radio and stage production. Paul Shyre created a &quot;dramatic revue&quot;, working together with Dos Passos. Howard Sackler also adapted it for a well-received 1968 audio production with Caedmon Books. Neil Peart of Rush was inspired by the trilogy to write the lyrics for the song &quot;The Camera Eye&quot; released on their &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; album in 1981, as well as the song &quot;The Big Money&quot; from their album &quot;Power Windows&quot; (1985). Margaret Bonds also collaborated with Dos Passos and wrote a musical theater work set to U.S.A. in 1959.

==Editions==
Dos Passos added a prologue with the title &quot;U.S.A.&quot; to The Modern Library edition of &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; and the same plates were used by Harcourt Brace for the trilogy. Houghton Mifflin issued two boxed three-volume sets in 1946 with color endpapers and illustrations by Reginald Marsh. The first illustrated edition was limited to 365 copies, 350 signed by both Dos Passos and Marsh in a deluxe binding with leather labels and beveled boards. The binding for the larger 1946 trade issue was tan buckram with red spine lettering and the trilogy designation &quot;U.S.A.&quot; printed in red over a blue rectangle on the spine and front cover. The illustrated edition was reprinted in various bindings until the Library of America edition appeared in 1996, 100 years after Dos Passos&#x27; birth.

<text>Via media is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;the middle road&quot; or the &quot;way between (and avoiding or reconciling) two extremes&quot;.

Its use in English is highly associated with Anglican self-characterization, or as a philosophical maxim for life akin to the golden mean which advocates moderation in all thoughts and actions.

Originating from the Delphic maxim &quot;nothing to excess&quot; and subsequent Ancient Greek philosophy where Aristotle (384–322 BCE) taught moderation, urging his students to follow the middle road between extremes, the &quot;via media&quot; was the dominant philosophical precept by which Ancient Roman civilisation and society was organised.

==Patristic period use==
Augustine&#x27;s The City of God (chapter 11) uses the phrase &quot;via media&quot; in the sense of a way connecting two opposing extremes, rather than in the sense of a golden mean or Goldilocks principle. 

Boethius has been associated with a variant of the term: &quot;Non est medium via&quot; (There is no middle way) discussing a life tending to the godly or tending to the bestial.

==Pre-Reformation==
===Jean Gerson===
French theologian and humanist Jean Gerson wrote in his &quot;On the Consolation of Theology&quot; (1418) about the &quot;via media et regia&quot;: the middle and royal way. Divine providence and human free will each have a mediating relation on the other: God saves those who humbly condemn themselves as incapacitated but seek him. The middle and royal way is of hope between despair and presumptuousness.

===Erasmus===
Erasmus of Rotterdam&#x27;s irenic but anti-fanatic approach is often classed as a &quot;via media&quot;, however this can be weighed against his repeated denial of leading a movement or setting up a new church, and may be described as extreme tolerance within Catholic borders.

==Anglicanism==

The term &quot;via media&quot; is frequently claimed by Anglican proponents, though not without debate, as a term of apologetics. 

The idea of a &quot;middle way&quot;, was proposed first, early in the Protestant Reformation, as between the Protestant traditions of Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity; subsequently by Richard Hooker as between Puritan and rump Roman Catholic practises; then by Bishop Hall as between the Calvinist and Arminianist beliefs; and finally by the Tractarians as between Roman Catholicism and the Magisterial Reformers. Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper has argued that the doctrinal history of the English Church is marked by discontinuities.

The idea of the Anglican middle way may also be associated to the teachings of theologians such as Martin Bucer, Thomas Cranmer and Heinrich Bullinger who advocated a religious solution in which secular authority would hold the ring in the religious dispute, and ensure political stability.

=== Historical Anglicanism ===
Anglicanism, which emerged out of the English Reformation, was originally seen as a &quot;via media&quot; between two forms of Protestantism—Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity. Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury who played a chief role in shaping Anglicanism, sought a middle way between Lutheranism and Calvinism, though he was closer to Calvinism. 

Historic Anglicanism is a part of the wider Reformed tradition, as &quot;the founding documents of the Anglican church—the Book of Homilies, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion—expresses a theology in keeping with the Reformed theology of the Swiss and South German Reformation.&quot; The Most Rev. Peter Robinson, presiding bishop of the United Episcopal Church of North America, writes:
===Richard Hooker===
A recent scholarly study points out that, while Richard Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Law of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot; has a reputation as &quot;the classic depiction of the English &quot;via media&quot; based upon the sound triumvirate of scripture, reason and tradition&quot;, the actual term &quot;via media&quot; nowhere appears in the work (written in English).

Hooker&#x27;s work concerned the form of Protestant church government as an argument against the extreme advocates of Puritanism, arguing that elements of Church of England practice condemned by the Puritans, in particular the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and the institution of bishops, are proper and accord with Scripture. 

===Joseph Hall===
Bishop of Norwich Joseph Hall (1574–1656) wrote a book &quot;Via Media: The Way of Peace, in the five Busy Articles, Commonly Known by the Name of Arminius&quot; (1619) in which he argued that Article 6 of the 39 Articles, &quot;Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation&quot;, precluded adopting officially any doctrine like &quot;irresistible grace&quot; that were not clear or explicit in Scripture.

===In Tractarianism===
Two centuries later, the phrase was used by John Henry Newman in setting out his influential views on Anglicanism, as part of the argument he brought forward with the Tractarian movement.
&quot;Via Media&quot; was the title of a series of the &quot;Tracts for Today&quot;, published by Newman around 1834 and expanded into published lectures. Newman, at that time, claimed that Anglican Church is, or could be, Catholic because it adopts Reformation theology without Roman accretions, but Apostolic because it kept the hierarchy, sacraments and liturgy. 

Newman&#x27;s tracts in particular used the title to pay homage to the inception of the Thirty-Nine Articles and in so doing claim that the Tractarian movement was of the same vein as early Church of England scholars and theologians. They examined the Elizabethan Settlement and reinterpreted it as a compromise between Rome and Reform.

The Tractarians promoted the idea of Anglicanism as a middle way between the extremes of Protestantism and Catholicism, which became later an idea of Anglicanism as a middle way between Rome and Protestantism itself. 

In justification of its idea of a &quot;via media&quot;, the Oxford Movement attributed this position to the works of the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker and in particular his book &quot;Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot;, which is accepted as a founding work on Anglican theology, a view of Hooker promoted by John Keble, who was one of the first to argue that English theology underwent such a &quot;decisive change&quot; in Hooker’s hands. Later theologians analysed Hooker&#x27;s approach to the particular doctrine of justification by faith as a middle way between the predestinationism of the extreme Calvinists and Lutheran and Arminian doctrines.

The Oxford Movement recast this &quot;via media&quot; as a middle way not within Protestantism but between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Its application to early Anglicanism has remained current in Anglican discourse.

==Nordic Lutheranism==
Some of the Nordic Lutheran Churches, chiefly the national churches of Sweden, Finland and Norway, likewise consider themselves as &quot;via media&quot; churches. The latter professes its faith as &quot;truly catholic, truly reformed, truly evangelical&quot;, a statement likewise echoed in the Canons of the Church of Sweden which states that the faith, confession and teachings of the Church are understood as an expression of the catholic Christian faith. It further states that this does not serve to create a new, confessionally peculiar interpretation, but concerns the apostolic faith as carried down through the traditions of the Church. These sentiment of these churches as a via media are expressed outright in the Common Statement of the Porvoo Communion, a communion of European Anglican and Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches:

<text>The Wings of the Dove is a 1902 novel by Henry James. It tells the story of Milly Theale, an American heiress stricken with a serious disease, and her effect on the people around her. Some of these people befriend Milly with honourable motives, while others are more self-interested.

== Plot summary ==

Kate Croy and Merton Densher are two betrothed Londoners who desperately want to marry but have very little money. Kate is constantly put upon by family troubles, and is now living with her domineering aunt, Maud Lowder. Into their world comes Milly Theale, an enormously rich young American woman who had previously met and fallen in love with Densher, although she has never revealed her feelings. Her travelling companion and confidante, Mrs. Stringham, is an old friend of Maud. Kate and Aunt Maud welcome Milly to London, and the American heiress enjoys great social success.

With Kate as a companion, Milly goes to see an eminent physician, Sir Luke Strett, because she worries that she is suffering from an incurable disease. The doctor is noncommittal but Milly fears the worst. Kate suspects that Milly is deathly ill. After the trip to America where he had met Milly, Densher returns to find the heiress in London. Kate wants Densher to pay as much attention as possible to Milly, though at first he doesn&#x27;t quite know why. Kate has been careful to conceal from Milly (and everybody else) that she and Densher are engaged.

With the threat of serious illness hanging over her, Milly decides to travel to Venice with Mrs. Stringham. Aunt Maud, Kate and Densher follow her. At a party Milly gives in her Venice &quot;palazzo&quot; (the older Palazzo Barbaro, called &quot;Palazzo Leporelli&quot; in the novel), Kate finally reveals her complete plan to Densher: he is to marry Milly so that, after her presumably soon-to-occur death, he will inherit the money they can marry on. Densher had suspected this was Kate&#x27;s idea, and he demands that she consummate their affair before he will go along with her plan.

Aunt Maud and Kate return to London while Densher remains with Milly. Unfortunately, the dying girl learns from a former suitor of Kate&#x27;s about the plot to get her money. She withdraws from Densher and her condition deteriorates. Densher sees her one last time before he leaves for London, where he eventually receives news of Milly&#x27;s death. Milly does leave him a large amount of money despite everything. But Densher does not accept the money, and he will not marry Kate unless she also refuses the bequest. Conversely, if Kate chooses the money instead of him, Densher offers to make the bequest over to her in full. The lovers part on the novel&#x27;s final page with a cryptic exclamation from Kate: &quot;We shall never be again as we were!&quot;

== Inspiration ==
James based the character Milly on Minny Temple (1845–1870), his beloved cousin who died from tuberculosis. In his autobiography James wrote of &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; as his attempt to wrap her dying in the &quot;beauty and dignity of art&quot;.
However, as he also said in the preface to the &quot;New York Edition&quot; text of the novel, James had to prepare the situation that was to occupy Milly for the last months of her life. He established the background of Kate and Densher&#x27;s inability to marry because of a lack of money.

Though the image of a dove has traditional associations with love and peaceful harmony, specific reference to a dove&#x27;s wings may connote wealth or money: &quot;Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her feathers with shimmering gold.&quot; (Psalm 68:13)

==Literary significance and criticism==
The &quot;Wings of the Dove&quot; has one of the most esteemed critical positions of any of James&#x27; works, although James himself sometimes expressed dissatisfaction with it. In his preface to the &quot;New York Edition&quot;, James spent much time confessing to supposed faults in the novel: defective structure, characters not as well presented as they could be, and a general failure to realise his initial plan for the book.

By and large, critics have regarded these faults as venial or nonexistent. Instead, they have concentrated on the central characters and supporting cast, and the technique that James uses in their presentation. Drawing on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick&#x27;s work, critic Rachel Haines has commented on lesbian themes in the novel—what Haines calls its &quot;queer metaphorics of influence and impressibility&quot;—incarnate in desire between Milly, Kate, and Susan (Mrs. Stringham).

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; 26th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Theatrical, television, and film adaptations==
The first television production of &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, presented in 1952 on &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; on CBS, was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and featured Charlton Heston in one of his earlier roles as Merton Densher. It was adapted for television again in 1959, when it was presented on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, also by CBS. It starred Dana Wynter as Kate Croy. Merton Densher, played by James Donald, was renamed Miles Denshaw for this version.

Playwright Guy Bolton adapted the novel for Broadway as &quot;Child of Fortune&quot; in 1956. It played a total of 23 performances, opening 13 November 1956 and closing less than three weeks later on 1 December. It starred Mildred Dunnock as Susan Shephard, Norah Howard as Mrs. Lowder, Edmund Purdom as Richard Denning (Merton Densher in the novel), Pippa Scott as Milly Temple (Theale in the novel), and Betsy von Furstenberg as Kate Croy. It played the Royale Theatre (now the Jacobs Theatre) and was directed by Jed Harris.

Composer Douglas Moore adapted the work into an opera which was given its premiere at the New York City Opera on 12 October 1961 with Regina Sarfaty as Kate Croy.

Christopher Taylor adapted the work into a play for the West End&#x27;s Lyric Theatre, London in 1963. Directed by Frith Banbury, it starred Gene Anderson as Kate Croy, Susannah York as Milly Theale, Wendy Hiller as Susan Shephard, Elspeth March as Maud Lowder, and James Donald as Merton Densher.

It was again adapted as a television play by the BBC in 1979, directed by Rudolph Cartier. Another TV adaptation occurred in 1979 starring John Castle and Suzanne Bertish.

&quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; has been made into theatrical films three times, first in 1981, again in 1997, and lastly in 1998. Iain Softley directed the 1997 adaptation starring Helena Bonham Carter as Kate Croy, Alison Elliott as Milly Theale, and Linus Roache as Merton Densher. The film received mostly favourable reviews, and fared well at the box office. Bonham Carter received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In 1998, the story was adapted into a modernized version for the film &quot;Under Heaven&quot;. In this version, the story is transplanted from London to Seattle.

<text>Gorani () also known by its main dialect; Hawrami (, &quot;Hewramî&quot;) is a Northwestern Iranian language spoken by ethnic Kurds in northeastern Iraq and western Iran and which with Zaza constitute the Zaza–Gorani languages. Gorani is considered a Kurdish dialect by many researchers. 

Gorani is spoken in Iraq and Iran and has four dialects: Bajelani, Hawrami, and Sarli, some sources also include the Shabaki as a dialect of Gorani as well. Of these, Hawrami was the traditional literary language and koiné of Kurds in the historical Ardalan region at the Zagros Mountains, but has since been supplanted by Central Kurdish and Southern Kurdish. Gorani is a literary language for many Kurds.

Gorani had an estimated 180,000 speakers in Iran in 2007 and 120,000 speakers in Iraq as well in 2007 for a total of 300,000 speakers. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; reports that the language is threatened in both countries and that speakers residing in Iraq includes all adults and some children, however it does not mention if speakers are shifting to Sorani or not. Many speakers of Gorani in Iran also speak Sorani, Persian, as well as Southern Kurdish. Most speakers in Iraq also speak Sorani, while some also speak Mesopotamian Arabic.

==Etymology==
The name Goran appears to be of Indo-Iranian origin. The name may be derived from the old Avestan word, &quot;gairi&quot;, which means mountain.

==Literature==

Under the independent rulers of Ardalan (9th–14th / 14th–19th century), with their capital latterly at Sanandaj, Gorani became the vehicle of a considerable corpus of poetry. Gorani was and remains the first language of the scriptures of the Ahl-e Haqq sect, or Yarsanism, centered on Gahvara. Prose works, in contrast, are hardly known. The structure of Gorani verse is very simple and monotonous. It consists almost entirely of stanzas of two rhyming half-verses of ten syllables each, with no regard to the quantity of syllables.

Names of forty classical poets writing in Gorani are known, but the details of the lives and dates are unknown for the most part. Perhaps the earliest writer is Mele Perîşan, author of a masnavi of 500 lines on the Shi&#x27;ite faith who is reported to have lived around 1356–1431. Other poets are known from the 17th–19th centuries and include Shaykh Mustafa Takhtayi, Khana Qubadi, Yusuf Yaska, Mistefa Bêsaranî and Khulam Rada Khan Arkawazi. One of the last great poets to complete a book of poems (divan) in Gurani is Mawlawi Tawagozi south of Halabja.

Kurdish Shahnameh is a collection of epic poems that has been passed down through speech from one generation to the next, that eventually some stories were written down by Almas Khan-e Kanoule&#x27;ei in the eighteenth century. There exist also a dozen or more long epic or romantic masnavis, mostly translated by anonymous writers from Persian literature including: Bijan and Manijeh, Khurshid-i Khawar, Khosrow and Shirin, Layla and Majnun, Shirin and Farhad, Haft Khwan-i Rostam and Sultan Jumjuma. Manuscripts of these works are currently preserved in the national libraries of Berlin, London, and Paris.

=== Example of Gorani poetry ===
&quot;Şîrîn û Xesrew &quot; written in 1740 by Khana Qubadî.

== Dialects ==
=== Bajelani ===
Bajelani is a Gorani dialect with about 59,000 speakers, predominately around Mosul, near Khanaqin and near the Khosar valley.

===Hewrami===
Hewrami () also known as Avromani, Awromani , Hawrami, or Horami, is a Gorani dialect and is regarded as the most archaic one. It is mostly spoken in the Hawraman region, a mountainous region located in western Iran (Iranian Kurdistan) and northeastern Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan). There are around 23,000 speakers, and it was classed as &quot;definitely endangered&quot; by UNESCO in 2010.

Due to concerns with the decline of Hawrami speakers, as people move away from the Hawraman region to cities like Erbil, Jamal Habibullah Faraj Bedar, a retired teacher from Tawela, decided to translate the Qur&#x27;an from Arabic into Hawrami. The translation took two and a half months and 1000 copies of the publication were printed in Tehran.

=== Sarli ===
Sarli is spoken in northern Iraq by a cluster of villages north of the Little Zab river, on the confluence of the Khazir River and the Great Zab river, just west-northwest of the city of Kirkuk. It has fewer than 20,000 speakers. Many speakers have been displaced by conflicts in the region. It is reportedly most similar to Bajelani but is also similar to Shabaki. It contains Kurdish, Turkish and Persian influences, like its neighbours Bajelani and Shabaki.

=== Shabaki ===
==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
All voiceless plosives and affricates are aspirated.

* A glottal stop [ʔ] may be heard before a word-initial vowel, but is not phonemic.
* Sounds /ʕ ʁ/ only occur in loanwords.
* /x/ can also be heard as [χ] among different dialects.
* /q/ can also be aspirated as [qʰ].
* The voiced /d/ may be lenited in post-vocal positions, and occur as a voiced dental approximant [ð̞]. In the Nawsud dialects, /d/ can be heard as an alveolar approximant sound [ɹ], and may also be devoiced when occurring in word-final positions as [ɹ̥].
* In the Nawsud and Nodša dialects, a word-initial /w/ can be heard as a [v] or a labialized [vʷ].
* /n/ when preceding velar consonants, is heard as a velar nasal [ŋ].

=== Vowels ===
* Sounds /æ ə/ both can be realized as an open-mid [ɛ].

== Hawrami Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===

* Hawrami distinguishes between two genders and two cases; Masculine &amp; Feminine, and Nominative &amp; Oblique. The two cases are otherwise referred to as the Direct and Indirect Cases.

Gender distinctions in nouns are indicated by a combination of final stress and vowel/consonant ending. Masculine nouns in the nominative form are indicated by a stressed &quot;-O&quot;, -Î”, &quot;-U&quot;, &quot;-E&quot;, &quot;-A&quot; and all consonant endings. Feminine nouns are indicated by an unstressed &quot;-E&quot;, &quot;-Î&quot;, a stressed &quot;-Ê&quot; and rarely, a stressed &quot;-A&quot;.

There are 3 declensions. The declensions of each gender will be demonstrated as an example.

First Declension (Masculine Consonant Ending; Feminine Short Unstressed Vowel Ending)

* Masculine : Kur (Boy)
* Feminine : Xatune (Queen)

Second Declension (Masculine Stressed Short Vowel Ending; Feminine Stressed &quot;-Ê” Ending)

* Masculine : Yane (House)
* Feminine : Namê (Name)

Third Declension (Stressed Long &quot;-A&quot; Ending)

* Masculine : Pîya (Man)
* Feminine : Dega (Village)

Source

Note: &quot; &#x27; &quot; indicates syllable followed will be stressed

In Hawrami, definiteness and indefiniteness is marked by two independent suffixes, &quot;-ew&quot;, and &quot;-(a)ka&quot;.
These suffixes decline for case and gender. The indefinite suffix &quot;-ew&quot; is declined by the first declension pattern while the definite suffix 
&quot;-(a)ka&quot; follows the second declension paradigm

<doc id="839210" wikidata="Q352409" url="?curid=839210" title="Warbird">
<text>A warbird is any vintage military aircraft now operated by civilian organizations and individuals, or in some instances, by historic arms of military forces, such as the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s No. 100 Squadron, or the South African Air Force Museum Historic Flight.

==Naming==
Although the term originally implied piston-driven aircraft from the World War II era, it is now often extended to include all airworthy former military aircraft, including jet-powered aircraft and helicopters.

The several different types of warbirds include the fighter, trainer, bomber, jet, transport, utility, etc. The smaller utility and trainer types are sometimes also called warbugs. Examples of aircraft types include the North American P-51 Mustang, Vought F4U Corsair, Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, North American B-25 Mitchell, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, North American T-6 Texan, Beechcraft T-34 Mentor, Messerschmitt Bf 109, Hawker Hurricane, Douglas C-47 Skytrain, Avro Lancaster, Douglas SBD Dauntless, Grumman F4F Wildcat, Douglas TBD Devastator, Grumman TBF Avenger, Grumman F6F Hellcat, Curtiss SB2C Helldiver and Supermarine Spitfire.

Sometimes, modern production aircraft such as Allison V-1710-powered Yakovlev Yak-9s from Yakovlev and replicas and reproductions of vintage aircraft are called &quot;warbirds&quot;, such as Messerschmitt Me 262s built by the Me 262 Project and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s by Flug + Werk; this can include any one of a large number of different aircraft designs from between World War I and the late 1930s, when military aircraft design was less complex. Such replicated warbirds may even be powered by vintage engines from the era of the aircraft design being flown, as Cole Palen and others associated with his institution did at Palen&#x27;s Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome aviation museum with accurate and airworthy reproductions of the Fokker Dr.I, Fokker D.VII, Fokker D.VIII, Sopwith Camel, and Sopwith Dolphin World War I aircraft.

==Restoration process==
Vintage warbird restoration, or classic aircraft restoration, is the process of taking aircraft from the previous era, and performing processes such as maintenance, repairs, and refurbishments to restore the aircraft to its original military configuration (minus any working weaponry). According to &quot;Classic Warplanes&quot;, some of the tasks performed on these vintage aircraft include:
* Structural repairs
* Standard maintenance
* Interior and exterior paint
* Decals and stamps
* Upholstery replacements
* Control heads and radios
* Parachutes, ejection seats, and ejection seat cartridges
* Rewiring
* Replacement of real weaponry with nonoperating replicas

==Airshows==
Restored warbirds are a frequent attraction at airshows. Airshows are held all over the world annually. &quot;Warbird Alley&quot; claims that some of the best-known airshows that feature warbirds are:
* Alliance Airshow – Fort Worth, Texas
* Commemorative Air Force AIRSHO – Midland, Texas
* Classic Fighters – Blenheim, Marlborough, NZ
* Dayton Airshow – Dayton, Ohio
* EAA AirVenture Oshkosh – Oshkosh, Wisconsin
* History of Flight Airshow – Geneseo, New York
* Indianapolis Airshow – Indianapolis, Indiana
* Miramar Airshow – Miramar, California
* Sun &#x27;n Fun – Lakeland, Florida
* Warbirds over the Beach – Virginia Beach, Virginia
* Warbirds over Monroe – Monroe, North Carolina
* Warbirds over Wanaka – Wānaka, Otago

In Europe, one of the best-known warbird airshows is the annual Flying Legends arranged in Imperial War Museum Duxford in UK. La Ferté-Alais air show in France collects warbirds annually, too. Warbirds fly also in most of the Shuttleworth Collection flying days in UK every summer.

In Australia a biennial event, Warbirds Downunder, is held at the Temora Aviation Museum in Temora, NSW &quot;for a two-day celebration of Australian aviation history&quot;. The event features warbirds from private and museum collections around the country (such as the HARS collection), both in flying and static displays, as well as being regularly supported by current squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force, including No. 100 Squadron and the RAAF formation aerobatic display team, the Roulettes.

In New Zealand there is an airshow over the Easter Weekend each year, this alternates between the Warbirds Over Wanaka in Wānaka, Otago and Classic Fighters in Blenheim, Marlborough. These are well supported by the large fleet of warbirds in NZ, as well as the RNZAF and RAAF. There are also smaller shows held in Masterton, Tauranga and Auckland.

== Air racing ==
Highly modified and &quot;stock&quot; warbirds can also frequently be seen at air races, since World War II-era fighters are among the fastest propeller-driven airplanes ever built. 

The premier event for warbird air racing is the Reno Air Races, held each September near Reno, Nevada. There are several classes of racing that facilitate the application of warbirds in the sport, including the:

* Jet Class
* T-6 Class
* Unlimited Class

Some of the most popular warbirds for racing are the North American P-51 Mustang, the Hawker Sea Fury, the Grumman F8F Bearcat, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, and the North American T-6 Texan.

In more recent years, straight wing, jet-powered warbirds such as the Aero L-29 Delfin, Aero L-39 Albatros, BAC Jet Provost, De Havilland Vampire, Messerschmitt Me 262, and PZL TS-11 Iskra have seen the conception of their own racing class, known simply as the Jet Class.

==Clubs and organizations==

The Australian Warbirds Association represents warbird owners in Australia and is responsible for oversight of warbird operations, a function delegated by Australia&#x27;s National Airworthiness Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Canadian groups include Warbirds Canada, Western Warbirds and the Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association. The New Zealand Warbirds Association supports warbird owners in that country.

Some organizations in the United States are:
*Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA): The primary focus of the group started with building individual airplanes, and it soon grew to include antiques, classics, warbirds, aerobatic aircraft, ultralights, helicopters, and contemporary manufactured aircraft.
*Warbirds of America is a nonprofit organization formed in 1964. A year after its start, it became a branch of the EAA.
*Classic Jet Aircraft Association
*Commemorative Air Force

<text>The National Capitol of Colombia (), often simply referred to as Capitolio Nacional &quot;(National Capitol)&quot;, is a building on Bolivar Square in central Bogotá, the construction of which began in 1848 and was finished in 1926. It houses both houses of the Congress of Colombia. It was designed by Thomas Reed.

==Murals==
In 1938, Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo painted two murals for the Capitolio Nacional in Bogotá.

In 1947 for the Inter American Conference, Santiago Martínez Delgado painted a majestic mural under commission of the then director of the OEA, Alberto Lleras Camargo and Conference organizer Laureano Gómez, two men who later became Presidents of Colombia.
This mural of the Elliptic chamber National Congress Building, made in the fresco style, represents Bolivar and Santander exiting the Cucuta congress during the creation of the Great Colombia. The mural is considered the most important fresco in the country and the artist&#x27;s main masterpiece.

<text>The Ambassadors is a 1903 novel by Henry James, originally published as a serial in the &quot;North American Review&quot; (NAR). The novel is a dark comedy which follows the trip of protagonist Lewis Lambert Strether to Europe to bring the son of his widowed fiancée back to the family business. The novel is written in the third-person, from Strether&#x27;s point of view.

== Plot summary ==
Lewis Lambert Strether, the protagonist of the novel, is a cultured man in his fifties from the fictional town of Woollett, Massachusetts, who is dispatched to Paris to find Chad, the wayward son of his fiancée Mrs Newsome. The book is entirely told from Strether&#x27;s point of view and chronicles his change from an American to a European view of things.

Strether, a middle-aged American of insignificant means, is sent to Paris by Mrs. Newsome, his wealthy fiancée. The mission he has been given is to talk her son, Chad, into returning to the family business in Woollett, Massachusetts. The Newsome family believes that Chad might be overstaying his European tour because of an inappropriate romantic liaison, perhaps with a vulgar adventuress. The reader is given to understand, in indirect ways, that if Strether fails, his engagement to Mrs. Newsome is at risk. Strether meets Maria Gostrey who delivers valuable insights about things European to him (and the reader).

Once Strether locates Chad, he is surprised to discover that Chad has improved from when he last knew him in America. Chad exhibits restrained urbanity, elegance and manners. This is not what Strether expected of someone in the grip of an inappropriate romantic entanglement. Strether wonders what has caused the transformation he sees in Chad. When Chad offers to introduce him to some of his close friends—Madame de Vionnet and her grown daughter Jeanne—Strether eagerly accepts. Miss Gostrey is also in Paris and continues as Stretcher’s advisor. She reveals she knew Madame de Vionnet at finishing school in Switzerland. When the introduction occurs, Strether finds the mother and the daughter to be refined, virtuous and thoroughly admirable. He wonders if the lovely daughter is what has brought about the improvements in Chad. He learns that Madame de Vionnet is married but has been separated from her husband for years.

Strether himself is introduced to Paris in a way that starts to open his own mind and heart to a larger vision of the world&#x27;s possibilities. He feels alive and renewed. His own interest in returning to America wanes. It is also clear that he is not exerting himself to talk Chad into returning. He develops an admiration for Madame de Vionnet. Chad has made clear he has no interest in marrying Jeanne de Vionnet, for whom he arranges a suitable marriage, while his liaison continues &quot;virtuously&quot; with Mme de Vionnet.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Newsome grows tired of Strether&#x27;s failure to act. She sends over a set of new ambassadors to accomplish the mission—including her daughter and son-in-law. The group clearly doesn&#x27;t see Paris, life&#x27;s possibilities, Chad or Madame de Vionnet in the same way that Strether does. Sarah (Newsome) Pocock demands that Strether get himself in line and insist to Chad that Chad return. The Pocock party departs on a brief tour before their departure for home.

Strether takes a day for himself to enjoy the countryside, and happens upon Chad and Madame de Vionnet in a manner that makes it evident that they are romantically and sexually involved. He feels disappointed but still acknowledges the improvements in Chad&#x27;s character.

Chad seems tempted to return to Woollett, which might mean the sundering of his relationship with Madame de Vionnet, despite his acknowledgement that this would abandon her to a condition of social and emotional desolation.

Strether will return to Woollett.

The story ends abruptly, leaving the characters&#x27; future movements an open question.

== Major themes ==
Henry James got the idea for &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; from his friend, novelist William Dean Howells, who while visiting his son in Paris was so impressed with European culture that he wondered if life hadn&#x27;t passed him by.

The theme of liberation from a cramped, almost starved, emotional life into a more generous and gracious existence plays throughout &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, yet it is noteworthy that James does not naïvely portray Paris as a faultless paradise for culturally stunted Americans. Strether learns about the reverse side of the European coin when he sees how desperately Marie fears losing Chad, after all she has done for him. As one critic proposed, Strether does not shed his American straitjacket only to be fitted with a more elegant European model, but instead learns to evaluate every situation on its merits, without prejudices, by selection. The final lesson of Strether&#x27;s European experience is to distrust preconceived notions and perceptions from anyone, anywhere, but to rely upon his own observation and judgment.

Mediation/Intermediation: a major theme of the novel involves Strether&#x27;s position as an ambassador. Strether, when giving his final account to Maria Gostrey, justifies his decisions by connecting his intermediary position to his concerns about gaining experience (and pleasure) whilst working on behalf of others. This conflict between personal desire and duty is important to consider when thinking about Strether&#x27;s psychology.

== Publishing history ==
The publishing history of &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; is complex, even for a work by James. The novel was written between October 1900 and July 1901,
before &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1902), yet he did not immediately find a publisher. To fit the eventual NAR serialization, passages were omitted, including three chapters.
For the book versions, James expected to use the serial-version proofs to provide the majority of copy to the London and New York City publishers, but the NAR supplied him only one set, instead of the requested two; thus, in August 1903, James supplied the British publisher with a carbon-copy of the unrevised, original typescript to enable them to meet their scheduled publication date. Moreover, at that time, he also lacked duplicate copies of the omitted passages, and those two circumstances resulted in significant textual variations in the Methuen edition.
One of the most serious variations was that a chapter, not published in the serial version, was inserted &quot;before&quot; &#x27;chapter 28&#x27;, not after it, as in the Harper edition (which James thoroughly proof-read). Five years later, when he prepared the revised text for the New York Edition (NYE), James worked from the Harper edition, and the two chapters (numbers 28 and 29) became chapters 1 and 2 in book 11.

In 1950, Robert E. Young, knowing neither the Methuen edition difference nor the details of James&#x27;s work on the novel, argued that the NYE order was incorrect, based upon the chronology of the story&#x27;s events.
Most critics agreed with Young, especially when Leon Edel noted the Methuen edition order,
and, since then, most published versions of &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, which usually use the NYE text, have reversed the order of the two chapters; however, the textual and bibliographical scholar Jerome McGann reopened the question in 1992.
He noted that the publishing history revealed by Birch made it unlikely that James had the order wrong in the editions he closely supervised.
Moreover, he controversially claimed that when James wrote to novelist Mrs Humphry Ward mentioning a &quot;fearful ... weakness&quot;
he was referring to the chapter order in her Methuen edition copy.
McGann explained the chronological discrepancies by noting that the start of (the Harper edition) chapter 28 tells that it will describe a conversation that will occur in the &#x27;future&#x27; (relative to the juncture reached in the story), and that the &#x27;that evening&#x27; line, at the start of chapter 29, refers not to the evening just described in chapter 28, but to the previous one.

Since 1992, few publishers of new editions of &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; have followed McGann&#x27;s research and restored James&#x27;s apparently preferred order, but, in characteristic postmodern way, it is now up to the reader to decide in which order these chapters should be read.

==Literary significance and criticism==
In the New York Edition preface Henry James proclaimed &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; as the best of his novels. Critics have generally agreed that it ranks high in the list of his achievements, though E. M. Forster and F. R. Leavis have been notable dissenters. James&#x27;s evocation of Paris has gained many plaudits, as the city becomes a well-realized symbol of the beauty and the sorrow of European culture.

Critical controversy has swirled over Strether&#x27;s refusal of Maria Gostrey, with some seeing it as a perverse rejection of his best chance for happiness. Others have said that Strether, whilst a great friend of Maria&#x27;s, is not in love with her, and that the couple could not have made a successful marriage. Critics also have speculated about whether or not Chad will heed Strether&#x27;s advice to remain with Marie, or if he will return to America for the substantial rewards of family business – their general verdict is that Chad will follow the money.

In a letter to a friend, James said that Strether bears a vague resemblance (though not facial) to his creator. It is true that Strether shows an ability to grow in understanding and good judgment, although some critics have seen him as limited and timid, despite his European experiences.

A continuing literary mystery is the nature of the &quot;little nameless object&quot; made in Woollett. Strether calls it: &quot;a little thing they make—make better, it appears, than other people can, or than other people, at any rate, do&quot;; and he calls the business: &quot;a manufacture that, if it&#x27;s only properly looked after, may well be on the way to become a monopoly&quot;. In an article in &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, Joshua Glenn proposes that the nameless object is a toothpick, while other critics have proposed matches, toilet articles, button hooks, et cetera.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; 27th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

<doc id="839227" wikidata="Q4909636" url="?curid=839227" title="Bill Jones (California politician)">
<text>William Leon Jones (born December 20, 1949) is an American politician from California who served in the California State Assembly and later served as California&#x27;s 25th Secretary of State for two terms from 1995 to 2003 under Governors Pete Wilson and later Gray Davis. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Governor of California in 2002 as well as an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate from California in 2004 against incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. As of 2024, Jones is the last Republican to be elected to California Secretary of State to date.

==Early life and education==
Born in Coalinga, California, Jones earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in agribusiness and plant sciences from California State University, Fresno in 1971.

==Member of the California State Assembly==
In 1976, Jones began his political career with an unsuccessful run for the 31st District State Assembly seat against then State Senate aide and future Congressman Richard H. Lehman. Lehman defeated Jones by just under ten points and went on to represent the Fresno-based Assembly district for six years before being elected to the U.S. House. Jones spent those six years working as a farmer.

After the redistricting of 1982, Jones again sought a seat in the state legislature. This time, Jones soundly defeated Democrat Clyde Gould for California&#x27;s 32nd Assembly District seat. Jones easily won reelection five times, carrying at least 69% of the vote in each election and twice running unopposed for the seat. Jones served in the Assembly from 1982 to 1994.

===Proposition 184===
One of Jones&#x27;s most notable contributions while in the Assembly was authoring Proposition 184, California&#x27;s three-strikes law, which passed with 72%. In 2000, 61% of California voters supported Proposition 36, which scaled the three-strikes law back by supporting drug treatment instead of life in prison for many convicted of possessing drugs. During the November 2004 elections, Proposition 66, which would have further limited California&#x27;s three-strikes law, was voted down at the polls by 53% of the voters.

===Assembly leadership===
For years, Jones was an intra-party adversary of Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson, and nearly ousted him from the party leadership. After authoring Proposition 184, Jones was elected the Assembly Republican Leader in 1991. In that capacity, Jones worked with the newly elected Republican Governor Pete Wilson, supporting Wilson&#x27;s plans to limit gerrymandering and raise taxes to cut the budget deficit. Due to more competitive districts, Republicans expected large gains in the 1992 election. However, the coattails of Democratic Presidential nominee Bill Clinton and the general strength of the Democratic Party in California led to disappointing results for Republican candidates. After the Republicans&#x27; weak showing in the November 1992 elections, Jones stepped down as Republican Leader, despite having easily won re-election in his own district.

==California Secretary of State==
Jones left the State Assembly after being elected Secretary of State, serving two terms in that office from 1995 to 2003. As the state&#x27;s chief elections officer, Jones stated his goal was &quot;100 percent participation but zero tolerance for voter fraud&quot;.

Use of the Internet was another priority of Jones&#x27;s during his tenure as Secretary of State. In 2000, his office drafted a report stating that &quot;California citizens should be online- not in line.&quot; His plan called for putting 90% of government services online by the expiration of his term while also &quot;taking important steps toward closing the Digital Divide to ensure no Californians are left behind.&quot; Through use of technology, the Secretary of State&#x27;s office registered or reregistered over 9 million voters, while purging 3 million ineligible voters from the rolls.

Jones was the first California Secretary of State to place campaign finance information on the Internet. In addition to providing instant Internet access to campaign finance reports, Jones launched the nation&#x27;s first Internet site that carried live election returns on Election Day. Following the 2000 presidential election, Jones developed a 10-point election reform plan to modernize voting systems used in California. The plan was soon adopted as a national model for other states to use. However, it was controversial for allowing for wide and open adoption of Internet and electronic vote technology with many private vendors competing and few or no technical safeguards in common.

===Role in suppressing vote pairing in October 2000===

During his tenure as California&#x27;s Secretary of State, Jones may have played a role in the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, when he charged that vote pairing Internet web sites were illegal. Many of these web sites were hosted in California, and were shut down by October 31 after Jones threatened their creators with criminal prosecution.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) got involved to protect the web sites, seeking a restraining order, followed by a permanent injunction, against Jones, alleging that he had violated the constitutional rights of the web site creators. The issue could be resolved only after the 2000 election had already occurred. Later, the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the legality of vote pairing.

==Run for California Governor==
In 2002, Jones ran in the Republican gubernatorial primary, finishing third, with 16%, behind former Mayor of Los Angeles Richard Riordan and businessman William Simon, Jr., who went on to be defeated by incumbent Gray Davis in the general election.

Jones&#x27; campaign largely addressed issues of budget deficits, electrical shortages, and perceived corruption in the Davis administration. Building on his success promoting technology as Secretary of State, Jones&#x27;s platform contained an eGovernment plank. However, much of his campaign concentrated on his past experience and support from state Republican luminaries like former Governor George Deukmejian, as opposed to specific plans for addressing the state&#x27;s budget and energy crises.

===E-mail spamming controversy===
During his unsuccessful primary campaign, Jones&#x27; campaign manager drew criticism for spamming (sending bulk emails to) potential voters and others around the world. After the spamming incidents, Jones spokesman Darrel Ng denied spamming was wrong and strongly defended the use of mass email for campaigns as an &quot;innovative way to use the Internet.&quot; The hosting provider of the Jones campaign web site terminated its services for the last few days of the campaign.

==Run for U.S. Senate==
Following his unsuccessful run for governor in 2002, Jones tried a run for the U.S. Senate. Although he won the 2004 Republican primary over former U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin, Jones lost the general election to Senator Barbara Boxer, with 38% of the vote. His campaign was so ill-funded that he did not run a single television commercial to promote his candidacy.

==Career after public office==

As Secretary of State, Jones had been responsible for regulating the voting-related services of private companies. After leaving office, he became a paid consultant to one of those companies, Sequoia Voting Systems.

<text>Andrey Yuryevich Bogolyubsky (died 28 June 1174; , lit. Andrey Yuryevich of Bogolyubovo), was Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal from 1157 until his death. During repeated internecine wars between the princely clans, Andrey accompanied his father Yuri Dolgorukiy during a brief capture of Kiev in 1149. 20 years later, his son led the Sack of Kiev (1169). He was canonized as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1702.

== Biography ==
According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL), Andrey&#x27;s parents married on 12 January 1108, as part of a peace agreement between the Rus&#x27; and the Cumans (Polovtsi). Andrey&#x27;s father was Yuri Vladimirovich (), Prince of Rostov and Suzdal commonly known as Yuri Dolgoruki (), a son of Volodimer II Monomakh, progenitor of the Monomakhovichi. Andrey&#x27;s mother was an unnamed Cuman princess, a daughter of Aepa son of Osen&#x27;. From this marriage, Andrey Bogolyubsky was born in 1111. Yuri proclaimed Andrey a prince in Vyshgorod (near Kiev).

=== Seizing power (1155–1162) ===
Andrey left Vyshgorod in 1155 and moved to Vladimir, a little town on the river Klyazma founded in 1108. In doing so, he removed the Icon of the Blessed Mother of God from Vyshgorod to Vladimir (thereafter known as the &quot;Virgin of Vladimir&quot;), an action condemned as theft by the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;, while the &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot; made no judgement on it. In 1153 he was the Prince of Murom-Ryazan. After his father&#x27;s death in 1157, Andrey ousted his younger brothers Mikhail &quot;Mikhalko&quot; Yurievich and Vsevolod &quot;the Big Nest&quot; from Rostov and Suzdal in 1162, thus uniting his father&#x27;s patrimony in Vladimir-Suzdal under his sole rule (&quot;samovlastets&quot;). He expelled his four brothers to the Byzantine Empire together with their mother, Yuri&#x27;s second wife.

Andrey established for himself the right to receive tribute from the populations of the Northern Dvina lands.

=== Construction works ===

He commenced the construction of fortifications around the town of Vladimir in 1158 (completed in 1164), as well as the Dormition Cathedral in Vladimir. In 1162 or 1164, Andrey sent an embassy to Constantinople, lobbying for a separate metropolitan see in Vladimir, but he was overruled by the patriarch of Constantinople. Fortifications around Vladimir were completed in 1164. The same year Andrey attacked the Volga Bolgars; he won a victory, but according to later traditions, a son was killed in battle, to whose memory he supposedly ordered the construction of the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl in 1165.

=== Sack of Kiev and brief overlordship (1169–1171) ===

In March 1169 Andrey&#x27;s troops sacked Kiev, devastating it as never before. Andrey did not take part in the attack; he stayed in Vladimir-Suzdal while his troops sacked the capital. After plundering the city, stealing much religious artwork, many books and valuables and devastating houses and religious buildings alike, Andrew claimed the title of Grand Prince, although he kept his residence at Vladimir, and emphasized the Byzantine religious heritage of Vladimir to assert Vladimir&#x27;s prestige and ecclesiastical independence from Kiev. Andrey had his brother Gleb appointed as prince of Kiev, in an attempt to create a position of overlordship for himself. This overlordship lasted for less than two years, ending with Gleb&#x27;s death on 20 January 1171. 

Andrey&#x27;s attempts to control other parts of Kievan Rus&#x27; were barely successful either; his Siege of Novgorod (1170) was a failure, and the Suzdalians were defeated. Although he managed to later blackmail the Novgorodians by imposing a blockade on the trade hub, securing the princehood for his son Yury Bogolyubsky in 1171, the Novgorodians immediately expelled him upon Andrey&#x27;s death in June 1174.

=== 1171–1173 Kievan succession crisis ===

Gleb&#x27;s death in 1171 caused another Kievan succession crisis, and Andrey became embroiled in a two-year war to regain control over Kiev. When the Rostislavichi of Smolensk and Iziaslavichi of Volhynia jointly secured the throne of Kiev, Andrey assembled another coalition and marched on Vyshhorod in 1173, where the Yurievichi–Olgovichi forces of Suzdalia and Chernigov were utterly defeated.

=== Death ===

The defeat of Andrey&#x27;s second coalition at Vyshgorod, the expansion of his princely authority, and his conflicts with the upper nobility, the boyars, gave rise to a conspiracy that resulted in Bogolyubsky&#x27;s death on the night of 28–29 June 1174, when twenty of them burst into his chambers and slew him in his bed.

According to the story of Andrey Bogolyubsky&#x27;s death as recorded in the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; of the &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; (Ipatiev), and the &quot;Radziwiłł Chronicle&quot;, his &quot;right hand&quot; was cut off by an assailant called &quot;Peter&quot; (Петръ):
* &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; &quot;sub anno&quot; 6683 (1175 [sic]): 
* &quot;Radziwiłł Chronicle&quot; &quot;sub anno&quot; 6683 (1175 [sic]): 

However, the &quot;Radziwiłł Chronicle&quot;″s adjoining miniature depicts his assailants cutting off his left arm. Moreover, when examined the exhumed body of Andrey Bogolyubsky in 1965, he &quot;found a lot of cut marks on the left humerus and forearm bones&quot;. A 2009 special historical study by Russian historian A.V. Artcikhovsky (2009) would later confirm Rokhlin&#x27;s observations.

Andrey&#x27;s death triggered the 1174–1177 Suzdalian war of succession.

==Descendants==
Children:
* A son, , reportedly buried in the Dormition Cathedral of Vladimir on 28 October 1164 (&quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;) or 1165 (&quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot;). According to later traditions, reported by Janet Martin (2007), Iziaslav&#x27;s death was related to the successful 1164 Suzdalian campaign against Volga Bulgaria, and Andrey supposedly commissioned the construction of the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl to commemorate this son in 1165. However, this connection is not mentioned in any chronicle until the 16th century; the Nerl church could be as old as 1158; and the &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot; reports that everyone in Andrey&#x27;s druzhina, which included Iziaslav, was in good health after the battle (а свою дружину всю сдраву, &quot;and his druzhina all healthy&quot;).
* A son, ; according to the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;, he died on 28 March 1172 (incorrectly listed under the year &quot;6681&quot;, which corresponds to 1173). According to Janet Martin (2007), Mstislav&#x27;s death was related to the ill-fated 1171–1172 Suzdalian winter campaign against Volga Bulgaria. The &quot;Kievan&quot; and &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot; agree that it was Mstislav Andreevich (Andreevič, Andrejevič) who commanded the Suzdalian-led coalition that sacked Kiev in 1169, and then installed his uncle Gleb (Andrey&#x27;s brother) as prince of Kiev.
* A son, Yury Bogolyubsky alias Iurii Andreevich, born 1160. Prince of Novgorod, 1171–1173. Briefly the husband of Queen Tamar of Georgia until she divorced him (1185–1188).

==Legacy==

* In the &quot;Suzdalian Chronicle&quot;, columns 367–369 contain the Short eulogy to Andrey Bogolyubsky.
* In the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;, columns 580–595 contain the Long eulogy to Andrey Bogolyubsky, also known as the &quot;Tale About the Slaying of Andrej Bogoljubskij&quot; (&quot;Povĕst&#x27; ob ubienii Andreja [Bogoljubskogo]&quot;).
* The ancient icon, Theotokos of Bogolyubovo, was painted in the 12th century at the request of Andrey Bogolyubsky.
* Andrey had the castle, Bogolyubovo, built near Vladimir, and it would become his favorite residence
* His victory over the Bulgars is remembered yearly during the Honey Feast of the Saviour.

<doc id="839233" wikidata="Q4200882" url="?curid=839233" title="Hinduism in Russia">
<text>Hinduism has been spread in Russia primarily due to the work of scholars from the religious organization International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and by itinerant Swamis from India and small communities of Indian immigrants. While ISKCON appears to have a relatively strong following in Russia, the other organizations in the list have a marginal presence in this country. There is an active Tantra Sangha operating in Russia. According to the 2012 official census, there are 140,010 Hindus in Russia, which accounts for 0.1% of the population of Russia.

==History==
The history of Hinduism in Russia dates back to at least the 16th century. When Astrakhan was conquered in 1556, the small Indian community became part of the Moscow state.

In the early eighteenth century, the first Russian emperor, Peter the Great, met the head of the Astrakhan Hindus and, at their request, asked the Russian Senate to issue a law protecting Hindu beliefs. This was the first law in Russia that protected a foreign creed.

In the late eighteenth century, Prussian traveller Pallas noted the presence of hundreds of Multani Vaiṣṇava Hindu merchant families at the mouth of the Volga river.

In 1971 A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), introduced it to Russia. In 1988, ISKCON was first registered as a religion. Later, it was re-registered in 1998. In the same year, there were 120 Krishna communities in Russia.

==Hindu denominations in Russia==

===Vaishnavism===
As of December 2005, the Federal Registration Service recorded 79 Hindu groups with a particular orientation on Krishnaism. These are the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, ISKCON Revival Movement, Science of Identity Foundation, Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math, , , , , among others.

===Shaivism===
The followers of Shaivism in Russia are the Naths, Lingayats (Veerashaiva), and .

===Hindu reform movements===
Hindu reform movements which have presence in Russia are the Brahma Kumaris, Ramakrishna Mission, Arya Samaj, Sri Aurobindo Ashram, International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres, Ananda Marga, Ananda Sangha, Self-Realization Fellowship, Sri Ramana Ashram, Sahaja Yoga, Sri Chinmoy Centre, Sanatan Sanstha, Sathya Sai Baba movement, Science of Identity Foundation, Shri Prakash Dham, the organizations associated with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Haidakhan Babaji (), and others. Brahma Kumaris have 20 centres, Ramakrishna Mission has one centre, Ananda Marga has a centre in Barnaul, Tantra Sangha has one registered branch in Moscow and another in Nizhniy Novgorod was officially recognized in 1993.

==Demography==
According to the 2012 official census, Hinduism is practised by 140,000 people, or 0.1% of the total population. It constitutes 12% of the population in the Altai Republic, 5% in Samara Oblast, 4% in Khakassia, Kalmykia, Bryansk Oblast, Kamchatka, Kurgan Oblast, Tyumen Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast, 3% in Sverdlovsk Oblast, 2% to 3% in Yamalia, Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai, Rostov Oblast and Sakhalin Oblast, and 0.1% to 0.2% in other federal subjects.

In 2006, the Russian capital Moscow had an estimated 10,000 Hare Krishna devotees and at least 5,000 Indians, Sri Lankans, Nepalese, and Mauritians following Hindu denominations.

The number of ISKCON followers in Russia is disputed. According to Sanjeet Jha of the Association of Indians of Russia, Russia&#x27;s Krishna devotee population is estimated to be as high as 250,000, while Filatov of the Institute of Oriental Studies estimates Russia&#x27;s Krishna population to be 15,000. According to Bhakti Vijnana Goswami, a Russian Iskcon guru, there were 50,000 active Hare Krishna devotees in Russia in 2011.

<text>Quentin Robert Duthie Skinner (born 26 November 1940) is a British intellectual historian. He is regarded as one of the founders of the Cambridge School of the history of political thought. He has won numerous prizes for his work, including the Wolfson History Prize in 1979 and the Balzan Prize in 2006. Between 1996 and 2008 he was Regius Professor of History at the University of Cambridge. He is the Emeritus Professor of the Humanities and Co-director of The Centre for the Study of the History of Political Thought at Queen Mary University of London.

==Biography==
Quentin Skinner was born near Manchester, the second son of Alexander Skinner (died 1979) and Winifred Skinner, née Duthie (died 1982). Though his family background is Scottish, and his father spent his career in the civil service in West Africa, he was raised and educated in England. He was educated at Bedford School from the age of seven. Like his elder brother, he won an entrance scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from where he graduated with a double-starred first in history in 1962. Skinner was elected to a fellowship of his college on his examination results, but moved later in 1962 to a teaching fellowship at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he remained until moving to the University of London in 2008. He is now an Honorary Fellow of both Christ&#x27;s College and Gonville and Caius College.

Skinner was appointed to a lectureship in the Faculty of History at the University of Cambridge in 1965. He spent a sabbatical year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1974–1975, where he was invited to stay, and where he remained until 1979 when he returned to Cambridge as Professor of Political Science. He was appointed to the post of Regius Professor of History in 1996, and in 1999 as pro-vice-chancellor of the university.

In 1979 he married Susan James, Professor Emerita of Philosophy at Birkbeck College London. They have a daughter and a son, and four grandchildren. He was previously married to Patricia Law Skinner, who was later married to the philosopher Bernard Williams.

Skinner has held a number of visiting appointments. He has been Visiting Fellow at the Research School of Social Science at the Australian National University (1970, 1994, 2006); visiting professor at Washington University in St. Louis (1982); Directeur d’Etudes Associé at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes (1987); Professeur Associé at Université Paris X (1991); visiting professor at the University of Leuven (1992); visiting professor at Northwestern University (1995, 2011); Professeur invité at the Collège de France (1997); Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (2003–04); Visiting Scholar at the Center for European Studies at Harvard University (2008); Laurence Rockefeller Visiting Professor at Princeton University (2013–14); Spinoza Visiting Professor at the University of Amsterdam (2014); visiting professor in the Global Fellowship programme at Peking University, Beijing (2017); and visiting professor at the University of Chicago (2017).

Skinner has delivered a number of named lecture series, including the Gauss Seminars at Princeton (1980), The Carlyle Lectures at Oxford (1980), The Messenger Lectures at Cornell (1983), The Tanner Lectures at Harvard (1984), the Ford Lectures at Oxford (2003), the Clarendon Lectures at Oxford (2011), the Clark Lectures at Cambridge (2012) and the Academia Sinica Lectures in Taiwan (2013).

Skinner has been a Fellow of the British Academy since 1981, and is also a foreign member of a number of national academies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1986), the Academia Europaea (1989), the American Philosophical Society (1997), the Royal Irish Academy (1999), the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (2007), the Österreichische Academie der Wissenschaften (2009), and the Royal Danish Academy (2015). He has been the recipient of Honorary Degrees from the University of Aberdeen, University of Athens, University of Chicago, University of Copenhagen, University of East Anglia, Harvard University, University of Helsinki, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, University of Kent, University of Oslo, University of Oxford, Adolfo Ibáñez University (Santiago), University of St Andrews and Uppsala University. He was awarded the Wolfson History Prize in 1979, the Sir Isaiah Berlin Prize of the British Political Studies Association in 2006, the Benjamin Lippincott Award (2001), the David Easton Award (2007) of the American Political Science Association, the (2008) and a Balzan Prize (2006). From 2009 until 2020, he was a member of the Balzan Prize Committee.

==Academia==

=== Methodology ===
Skinner is regarded as one of the founders of the &#x27;Cambridge School&#x27; of the history of political thought, best known for its attention to what J. G. A. Pocock has described as the &#x27;languages&#x27; in which moral and political philosophy has been written. Skinner&#x27;s contribution has been to articulate a theory of interpretation in which leading texts in the history of political theory are treated essentially as interventions in on-going political debates, and in which the main focus is on what individual writers may be said to have been doing in what they wrote.

This emphasis on political writing as a form of action derives from developments in ordinary language philosophy made by Ludwig Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin. Wittgenstein&#x27;s insight was (in Skinner’s words) &quot;that we should stop asking about the &#x27;meanings&#x27; of words and focus instead on the various functions they are capable of performing in different language games&quot;. Skinner takes Austin to have extended Wittgenstein&#x27;s argument in isolating the concept of a speech act, which is described by Skinner as the notion that &quot;whenever we use language for purposes of communication, we are always doing something as well as saying something&quot;. According to Skinner, that means that any analysis is incomplete if it restricts itself to studying what a past thinker said on a given issue. Historians must also recover what a thinker hoped to achieve in saying it. 
Skinner consequently proposes a form of linguistic contextualization that involves situating a text in relation to other texts and discourses. In that perspective, the text is a &quot;response&quot; to other thinkers, texts or cultural discourses. Skinner believes that ideas, arguments and texts should be placed in their original context. One consequence of this view is an emphasis on the necessity of studying less well-known political writers as a means of shedding light on the contemporary debates these classic texts contributed to. In that way, it becomes possible to decipher the original purpose of a text. To Skinner, texts are then seen as weapons or tools that can, for example, be used to &quot;support&quot;, &quot;discredit&quot;, or &quot;legitimize&quot; specific social and political arrangements. In its earlier versions this added up to a critique of the approach of an older generation, and particularly of Leo Strauss and his followers.

=== Empirical focus ===
Skinner&#x27;s historical work has mainly focused on political thinking in early-modern Europe. He has written a book on Niccolò Machiavelli, three books on Thomas Hobbes, and his &quot;Foundations of Modern Political Thought&quot; covers the whole period. He has specifically been concerned with the emergence of modern theories about the nature of the state, and with debates about the nature of political liberty.

==Miscellany==

When Skinner was interviewed by Alan Macfarlane, as part of his series of online conversations with academics, Skinner admitted that he had been a member of the Cambridge Apostles, a secret debating society at Cambridge University. He also revealed that Amartya Sen was a member at the same time. Sen mentioned their membership of the Apostles in his memoir &quot;Home in the World&quot;. He commented that they had both been &quot;outed&quot; in a book published about the Apostles sometime before.

On 6 October 1995, Skinner&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Modern Political Thought&quot; was included in the list published by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of &#x27;The 100 Most Influential Books since World War II&#x27;.

On 14 May 2009, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, in an article about Skinner&#x27;s move from Cambridge to the University of London, spoke of Skinner&#x27;s republicanism, reporting that this led him to refuse a knighthood he was offered when he became Regius Professor of History at Cambridge.

The Balzan-Skinner Lectureship, renamed the &quot;Quentin Skinner Fellowship in Intellectual History since 1500&quot;, was established in 2009 at the University of Cambridge. The Quentin Skinner fellow holds a visiting fellowship at the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities for one term of the academic year, which culminates in the Quentin Skinner Lecture and an associated symposium.

<text>Crevice weaver spiders (Filistatidae) comprise cribellate spiders with features that have been regarded as &quot;primitive&quot; for araneomorph spiders. They are weavers of funnel or tube webs. The family contains 18 genera and more than 120 described species worldwide.

One of the most abundant members of this family in the Americas is the southern house spider (&quot;Kukulcania hibernalis&quot;). Named after the fierce Meso-American god Kukulkan, the females are large (up to nearly 20 mm) dark-colored spiders and males are light brown, smaller (about 10 mm), but more long-legged and with palps that are held together in front of their carapaces like the horn of a unicorn. The males also have a darker streak on the center of the dorsal carapace that causes them to be often mistaken for brown recluse spiders. The tiny members of the genus &quot;Filistatinella&quot; are like miniature versions of &quot;Kukulcania&quot;. The nominate genus &quot;Filistata&quot; is Afro-Eurasian in distribution. In many older books the species from the Americas now placed in the genus &quot;Kukulcania&quot; are placed in &quot;Filistata&quot;.

A striking visual characteristic of the family, beside dimorphism, is the unusual upward bend encountered near the femur of the first pair of legs. While resembling hydraulic muscle mechanisms akin to arthropods, this modification actually allows the spider to retain the prey directly from the crevice it occupies. Also, if the larger prey ever tries to pull it from the crevice, the spider can use these legs to &quot;grab&quot; to the side walls and hence make it difficult. Many &quot;Kukulcania&quot; species also use them to dig holes in the soft ground at a 25- to 30-degree angle.

==Taxonomy==
The family Filistatidae was created in 1867 by Anton Ausserer. It was based on the species he called &quot;Filistata bicolor&quot; (now &quot;Filistata insidiatrix&quot;), a Mediterranean species also found in southern Austria.

===Phylogeny===
On the basis of the features of the male and female genitalia, the family was placed in the Haplogynae, usually as the sister taxon of the remaining members of the group. However, unlike the other haplogynes, Filistatidae are cribellate and do not show a decrease in the number of segments of the anterior lateral spinnerets. They have other features which have been regarded as &quot;primitive&quot;: an M-shaped intestine, only leg IV moving while combing silk, and posterior book lung leaves being present in early juveniles. A 2013 study based on molecular evidence placed the family as sister to a clade consisting of Hypochilidae and the remaining haplogynes. The precise phylogenetic position of the family was described in 2014 as &quot;one of the most enigmatic problems in spider phylogeny&quot;.

A 2015 study, based on genomic data, places Filistatidae with Hypochilidae in a clade outside most of the families previously placed in Haplogynae:
This placement suggests that features that were thought to be &quot;primitive&quot; to araneomorph spiders as a whole (such as an M-shaped midgut) could actually be novel derived features (synapomorphies) of the Hypochilidae-Filistatidae clade.

<doc id="839255" wikidata="Q247372" url="?curid=839255" title="Tender Is the Night">
<text>Tender Is the Night is the fourth and final novel completed by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the French Riviera during the twilight of the Jazz Age, the 1934 novel chronicles the rise and fall of Dick Diver, a promising young psychiatrist, and his wife, Nicole, who is one of his patients. The story mirrors events in the lives of the author and his wife Zelda Fitzgerald as Dick starts his descent into alcoholism and Nicole struggles with mental illness.

Fitzgerald began the novel in 1925 after the publication of his third novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. During the protracted writing process, the mental health of his wife rapidly deteriorated, and she required extended hospitalization due to her suicidal and homicidal tendencies. After her hospitalization in Baltimore, Maryland, the author rented the &quot;La Paix&quot; estate in the suburb of Towson to be close to his wife, and he continued working on the manuscript.

While working on the book, Fitzgerald was beset with financial difficulties and drank heavily. He kept afloat by borrowing money from both his editor Max Perkins and his agent Harold Ober, as well as writing short stories for commercial magazines. Fitzgerald completed the work in fall 1933, and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; serialized the novel in four installments between January and April 1934 before its publication on April 12, 1934. Although artist Edward Shenton illustrated the serialization, he did not design the book&#x27;s jacket. The jacket was by an unknown artist, and Fitzgerald disliked it. 
The title is taken from the poem &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; by John Keats.

Two versions of the novel are in print. The first version, published in 1934, uses flashbacks; the second, revised version, prepared by Fitzgerald&#x27;s friend and critic Malcolm Cowley on the basis of notes for a revision left by Fitzgerald, is ordered chronologically and was first published posthumously in 1948. Critics have suggested that Cowley&#x27;s revision was undertaken due to negative reviews of the temporal structure of the first version of the book.

Fitzgerald considered the novel to be his masterwork. Although it received a tepid response upon release, it has grown in acclaim over the years and is now regarded as among Fitzgerald&#x27;s best works. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked the novel 28th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

== Plot summary ==

Dick and Nicole Diver are a glamorous couple who rent a villa in the South of France and surround themselves with a coterie of American expatriates. Rosemary Hoyt, a 17-year-old actress, and her mother are staying at a nearby resort. Rosemary becomes infatuated with Dick and becomes close to Nicole.

Rosemary senses something is wrong with the couple, and her suspicions are confirmed when another guest at a party, Violet McKisco, reports witnessing Nicole&#x27;s nervous breakdown in a bathroom. Tommy Barban, another guest, comes to the defense of Nicole and insists that Violet is lying. Angered by this accusation, Violet&#x27;s husband Albert duels Barban on the beach, but both men miss their shots. Following these events, Dick, Nicole, Rosemary, and others depart the French Riviera.

Soon after, Rosemary is now a constant companion of both Dick and Nicole in Paris. She attempts to seduce Dick in her hotel room, but he rebuffs her advances, although he admits that he loves her. Much later, a black man named Jules Peterson is found murdered in Rosemary&#x27;s bed at the hotel, a potential scandal which could destroy Rosemary&#x27;s career. Dick moves the blood-soaked body out of the room to cover up any implied sexual relationship between Rosemary and Peterson.

A flashback occurs in the narrative. In Spring 1917, Dick Diver—a promising young doctor—visits psychopathologist Franz Gregorovius in Zurich, Switzerland. While visiting Franz, he meets a patient named Nicole Warren, a wealthy young woman whose sexual abuse by her father has led to mental neuroses. Over a period of time they exchange letters. With the permission of Franz who believes that Dick&#x27;s friendship benefits Nicole&#x27;s well-being, they start seeing each other. As Nicole&#x27;s treatment progresses, she becomes infatuated with Dick who, in turn, develops Florence Nightingale syndrome. He determines to marry Nicole in order to provide her with lasting emotional stability.

Dick is offered a partnership in a Swiss psychiatric clinic by Franz, and Nicole uses her finances to pay for the enterprise. After his father&#x27;s death, Dick travels to America for the burial and then journeys to Rome in hopes of seeing Rosemary. They start a brief affair which ends abruptly and painfully. A heartbroken Dick is involved in an altercation with the Italian police and is physically beaten. Nicole&#x27;s sister helps him to get out of jail. After this public humiliation, his incipient alcoholism increases. When his alcoholism threatens his medical practice, Dick&#x27;s ownership share of the clinic is purchased by American investors following Franz&#x27;s suggestion.

Dick and Nicole&#x27;s marriage disintegrates as he pines for Rosemary who has become a successful Hollywood star. Nicole distances herself from Dick as his self-confidence and friendliness turn into sarcasm and rudeness towards everyone. His constant unhappiness over what he could have been fuels his alcoholism, and Dick becomes embarrassing in social and familial situations. A lonely Nicole enters into an affair with Tommy Barban. She later divorces Dick and marries her lover.

== Background and composition ==

=== Sojourn in Europe ===
While abroad in Europe, F. Scott Fitzgerald began writing his fourth novel almost three weeks after the publication of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in April 1925. He planned to tell the story of Francis Melarkey, a young Hollywood technician visiting the French Riviera with his domineering mother. Francis falls in with a circle of charming American expatriates, emotionally disintegrates, and kills his mother. Fitzgerald&#x27;s tentative titles for the novel were &quot;World&#x27;s Fair,&quot; &quot;Our Type&quot; and &quot;The Boy Who Killed His Mother.&quot; The characters of the charming American expatriates were based on Fitzgerald&#x27;s acquaintances Gerald and Sara Murphy and were named Seth and Dinah Piper. Francis was intended to fall in love with Dinah, an event that would precipitate his disintegration.

Fitzgerald wrote five drafts of this earlier version of the novel in 1925 and 1926, but he was unable to finish it. Nearly all of what he wrote made it into the finished work in altered form. Francis&#x27;s arrival on the Riviera with his mother, and his introduction to the world of the Pipers, was transposed into Rosemary Hoyt&#x27;s arrival with her mother, and her introduction to the world of Dick and Nicole Diver. Characters created in this early version survived into the final novel, particularly Abe and Mary North (originally Grant) and the McKiscos.

Several incidents such as Rosemary&#x27;s arrival and early scenes on the beach, her visit to the Riviera movie studio, and the dinner party at the Divers&#x27; villa all appeared in this original version, but with Francis in the role of the wide-eyed outsider that would later be filled by Rosemary. Also, the sequence in which a drunken Dick is beaten by police in Rome was written in this first version as well and was based on a real incident that happened to Fitzgerald in Rome in 1924.

=== Return to America ===
After a certain point, Fitzgerald became stymied with the novel. He, Zelda, and their daughter Scottie returned to the United States in December 1926 after several years in Europe. Film producer John W. Considine Jr. invited Fitzgerald to Hollywood during its golden age to write a flapper comedy for United Artists. He agreed and moved into a studio-owned bungalow with Zelda in January 1927. In Hollywood, the Fitzgeralds attended parties where they danced the black bottom and mingled with film stars.

While attending a lavish party at the Pickfair estate, Fitzgerald met 17-year-old Lois Moran, a starlet who had gained widespread fame for her role in &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1925). Desperate for intellectual conversation, Moran and Fitzgerald discussed literature and philosophy for hours while sitting on a staircase. Fitzgerald was 31 years old and past his prime, but the smitten Moran regarded him as a sophisticated, handsome, and gifted writer. Consequently, she pursued a relationship with him. The starlet became a muse for the author, and he wrote her into a short story called &quot;Magnetism&quot;, in which a young Hollywood film starlet causes a married writer to waver in his sexual devotion to his wife. Fitzgerald later rewrote Rosemary Hoyt—one of the central characters in &quot;Tender is the Night&quot;—to mirror Moran.

Jealous of Fitzgerald&#x27;s relationship with Moran, an irate Zelda set fire to her expensive clothing in a bathtub as a self-destructive act. She disparaged the teenage Moran as &quot;a breakfast food that many men identified with whatever they missed from life.&quot; Fitzgerald&#x27;s relations with Moran further exacerbated the Fitzgeralds&#x27; marital difficulties and, after merely two months in Hollywood, the unhappy couple departed for Delaware in March 1927.

Fitzgerald supported himself and his family in the late 1920s with his lucrative short-story output for slick magazines such as the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, but he was haunted by his inability to progress on the novel. Around 1929 he tried a new angle on the material, starting over with a shipboard story about a Hollywood director Lew Kelly and his wife Nicole as well as a young actress named Rosemary. But Fitzgerald only completed two chapters of this version.

=== Zelda&#x27;s mental illness ===

By Spring 1929, the Fitzgeralds had returned to Europe when Zelda&#x27;s mental health deteriorated. During an automobile trip to Paris along the mountainous roads of the Grande Corniche, Zelda seized the car&#x27;s steering wheel and tried to kill herself, her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, and their 9-year-old daughter Scottie by driving over a cliff. After this homicidal incident, Zelda sought psychiatric treatment, and doctors diagnosed her with schizophrenia in June 1930. Zelda&#x27;s biographer, Nancy Milford, quotes Dr. Oscar Forel&#x27;s contemporary psychiatric diagnosis: 

Seeking a cure for her mental illness, the couple traveled to Switzerland where Zelda underwent further treatment at a clinic. Zelda&#x27;s ingravescent mental illness and the death of Fitzgerald&#x27;s father in 1931 dispirited the author. Devastated by these events, an alcoholic Fitzgerald settled in suburban Baltimore where he rented the &quot;La Paix&quot; estate from architect Bayard Turnbull. He decided the novel&#x27;s final plot would involve a young man of great potential who marries a mentally-ill woman and sinks into despair and alcoholism when their doomed marriage fails.

=== Final draft and publication ===
Fitzgerald wrote the final version of &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; in 1932 and 1933. He salvaged almost everything he had written for the earlier Melarkey draft of the novel, as well as borrowed ideas and phrases from many short stories he had written in the years since completing &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Ultimately, he poured everything he had into &quot;Tender&quot;—his feelings regarding his wasted talent and self-perceived professional failure; his animosity towards his parents; his marriage to Zelda and her mental illness; his infatuation with actress Lois Moran, and Zelda&#x27;s affair with the French aviator Edouard Jozan.

Fitzgerald finished the work in the autumn of 1933, and it was serialized in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; over four parts from January to April 1934, leading up to its release on April 12, 1934. Although Edward Shenton provided illustrations for the serialization, he wasn&#x27;t responsible for the book&#x27;s jacket design, which was done by an unknown artist and not favored by Fitzgerald. The title of the novel was inspired by John Keats&#x27; poem &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Fitzgerald deemed the novel to be his masterwork and believed it would eclipse the acclaim of his previous works. It was instead met with lukewarm sales and mixed reviews. One book review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by critic J. Donald Adams was particularly harsh:

In contrast to the negative review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Burke Van Allen hailed the novel as a masterpiece in an April 1934 review in &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;:

Three months after its publication, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; had sold only 12,000 copies compared to &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; which sold over 50,000 copies. Despite a number of positive reviews, a consensus emerged that the novel&#x27;s Jazz Age setting and subject matter were both outdated and uninteresting to readers. The unexpected failure of the novel puzzled Fitzgerald for the remainder of his life.

Various hypotheses have arisen as to why the novel did not receive a warmer reception upon release. Fitzgerald&#x27;s friend, author Ernest Hemingway, opined that critics had initially only been interested in dissecting its weaknesses, rather than giving due credit to its merits. He argued that such overly harsh criticism stemmed from superficial readings of the material and Depression-era America&#x27;s reaction to Fitzgerald&#x27;s status as a symbol of Jazz Age excess. In his later years, Hemingway re-read the work and remarked that, in retrospect, &quot;&quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; gets better and better&quot;.

== Posthumous reevaluation ==
Following Fitzgerald&#x27;s death in 1940, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;″s critical reputation has steadily grown. Later critics have described it as &quot;an exquisitely crafted piece of fiction&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest American novels&quot;. It is now widely regarded as among Fitzgerald&#x27;s most accomplished works, with some agreeing with the author&#x27;s assessment that it surpasses &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

Several critics have interpreted the novel to be a feminist work and posited that the patriarchal attitudes of the reactionary 1930s underlay the critical dismissal. They have noted the parallels between Dick Diver and Jay Gatsby, with many regarding the novel and particularly Diver&#x27;s character, as Fitzgerald&#x27;s most emotionally and psychologically complex work.

Christian Messenger argues that Fitzgerald&#x27;s book hinges on the sustaining sentimental fragments: &quot;On an aesthetic level, Fitzgerald&#x27;s working through of sentiment&#x27;s broken premises and rhetoric in &quot;Tender&quot; heralds a triumph of modernism in his attempt to sustain his sentimental fragments and allegiances in new forms.&quot; He calls it &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s richest novel, replete with vivid characters, gorgeous prose, and shocking scenes,&quot; and calls attention to Slavoj Žižek&#x27;s use of the book to illustrate the nonlinear nature of experience.

== Legacy and influence ==
In 1998, the Modern Library included the novel at #28 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Radcliffe&quot; later included it at #62 in its rival list. NPR included it at #69 on its 2009 list titled &quot;100 Years, 100 Novels&quot;. In 2012 it was listed as one of the &quot;1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In 1955, an hour long adaptation was broadcast live by CBS on the General Electric sponsored show &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, with Mercedes McCambridge as Nicole Diver. Dick Diver was played by James Daly. The telefilm was written by Whitfield Cook and directed and produced by McCambridge’s then-husband, Fletcher Markle. It featured original music by eminent composer David Raksin. New York Times reviewer John P. Shanley panned it as &quot;an inept conception&quot; and &quot;an unforgivable treatment of a gifted author&#x27;s work.&quot;

In 1962, a film adaptation was released with Jason Robards as Dick Diver and Jennifer Jones as Nicole Diver. The song &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; from the movie soundtrack was nominated for the 1962 Academy Awards for Best Song.

Two decades later, in 1985, a television mini-series of the book was co-produced by the BBC, 20th Century Fox Television, and Showtime Entertainment. The mini-series featured Peter Strauss as Dick Diver, Mary Steenburgen as Nicole Diver, and Sean Young as Rosemary Hoyt.

In 1995, a stage adaptation by Simon Levy, with permission of the Fitzgerald Estate, was produced at The Fountain Theatre, Los Angeles. It won the PEN Literary Award in Drama and several other awards.

Boris Eifman&#x27;s 2015 ballet &quot;Up and Down&quot; is based loosely on the novel.

<doc id="839259" wikidata="Q164400" url="?curid=839259" title="Active electronically scanned array">
<text>An active electronically scanned array (AESA) is a type of phased array antenna, which is a computer-controlled antenna array in which the beam of radio waves can be electronically steered to point in different directions without moving the antenna. In the AESA, each antenna element is connected to a small solid-state transmit/receive module (TRM) under the control of a computer, which performs the functions of a transmitter and/or receiver for the antenna. This contrasts with a passive electronically scanned array (PESA), in which all the antenna elements are connected to a single transmitter and/or receiver through phase shifters under the control of the computer. AESA&#x27;s main use is in radar, and these are known as active phased-array radar (APAR).

The AESA is a more advanced, sophisticated, second-generation of the original PESA phased-array technology. PESAs can only emit a single beam of radio waves at a single frequency at a time. The PESA must utilize a Butler matrix if multiple beams are required. The AESA can radiate multiple beams of radio waves at multiple frequencies simultaneously. AESA radars can spread their signal emissions across a wider range of frequencies, which makes them more difficult to detect over background noise, allowing ships and aircraft to radiate powerful radar signals while still remaining stealthy, as well as being more resistant to jamming. Hybrids of AESA and PESA can also be found, consisting of subarrays that individually resemble PESAs, where each subarray has its own RF front end. Using a hybrid approach, the benefits of AESA (e.g., multiple independent beams) can be realized at a lower cost compared to pure AESA.

==History==


Bell Labs proposed replacing the Nike Zeus radars with a phased-array system in 1960, and was given the go-ahead for development in June 1961. The result was the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar (ZMAR), an early example of an active electronically steered array radar system. ZMAR became MAR when the Zeus program ended in favor of the Nike-X system in 1963. The MAR (Multi-function Array Radar) was made of a large number of small antennas, each one connected to a separate computer-controlled transmitter or receiver. Using a variety of beamforming and signal processing steps, a single MAR was able to perform long-distance detection, track generation, discrimination of warheads from decoys, and tracking of the outbound interceptor missiles.

MAR allowed the entire battle over a wide space to be controlled from a single site. Each MAR, and its associated battle center, would process tracks for hundreds of targets. The system would then select the most appropriate battery for each one, and hand off particular targets for them to attack. One battery would normally be associated with the MAR, while others would be distributed around it. Remote batteries were equipped with a much simpler radar whose primary purpose was to track the outgoing Sprint missiles before they became visible to the potentially distant MAR. These smaller Missile Site Radars (MSR) were passively scanned, forming only a single beam instead of the MAR&#x27;s multiple beams.

While MAR was ultimately successful, the cost of the system was enormous. When the ABM problem became so complex that even a system like MAR could no longer deal with realistic attack scenarios, the Nike-X concept was abandoned in favor of much simpler concepts like the Sentinel program, which did not use MAR. A second example, MAR-II, was abandoned in-place on Kwajalein Atoll.

The first Soviet APAR, the 5N65, was developed in 1963–1965 as a part of the S-225 ABM system. After some modifications in the system concept in 1967 it was built at Sary Shagan Test Range in 1970–1971 and nicknamed Flat Twin in the West. Four years later another radar of this design was built on Kura Test Range, while the S-225 system was never commissioned.

* The first military ground-based AESA was the J/FPS-3 which became fully operational with the 45th Aircraft Control and Warning Group of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in 1995.
* The first series production ship-based AESA was the OPS-24, a fire-control radar introduced on the Japanese &quot;Asagiri&quot;-class destroyer DD-155 &quot;Hamagiri&quot; launched in 1988.
* The first airborne series production AESA was the EL/M-2075 Phalcon on a Boeing 707 of the Chilean Air Force that entered service in 1994.
* The first AESA on a combat aircraft was the J/APG-1 introduced on the Mitsubishi F-2 in 1995.
* The first AESA on a missile is the seeker head for the AAM-4B, an air-to-air missile carried by the Mitsubishi F-2 and Mitsubishi-built McDonnell-Douglas F-15J.

US based manufacturers of the AESA radars used in the F-22 and Super Hornet include Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. These companies also design, develop and manufacture the transmit/receive modules which comprise the &#x27;building blocks&#x27; of an AESA radar. The requisite electronics technology was developed in-house via Department of Defense research programs such as MMIC Program. In 2016 the Congress funded a military industry competition to produce new radars for two dozen National Guard fighter aircraft.

==Basic concept==

Radar systems generally work by connecting an antenna to a powerful radio transmitter to emit a short pulse of signal. The transmitter is then disconnected and the antenna is connected to a sensitive receiver which amplifies any echos from target objects. By measuring the time it takes for the signal to return, the radar receiver can determine the distance to the object. The receiver then sends the resulting output to a display of some sort. The transmitter elements were typically klystron tubes or magnetrons, which are suitable for amplifying or generating a narrow range of frequencies to high power levels. To scan a portion of the sky, the radar antenna must be physically moved to point in different directions.

Starting in the 1960s new solid-state devices capable of delaying the transmitter signal in a controlled way were introduced. That led to the first practical large-scale passive electronically scanned array (PESA), or simply phased-array radar. PESAs took a signal from a single source, split it into hundreds of paths, selectively delayed some of them, and sent them to individual antennas. The radio signals from the separate antennas overlapped in space, and the interference patterns between the individual signals were controlled to reinforce the signal in certain directions, and mute it in all others. The delays could be easily controlled electronically, allowing the beam to be steered very quickly without moving the antenna. A PESA can scan a volume of space much quicker than a traditional mechanical system. Additionally, thanks to progress in electronics, PESAs added the ability to produce several active beams, allowing them to continue scanning the sky while at the same time focusing smaller beams on certain targets for tracking or guiding semi-active radar homing missiles. PESAs quickly became widespread on ships and large fixed emplacements in the 1960s, followed by airborne sensors as the electronics shrank.

AESAs are the result of further developments in solid-state electronics. In earlier systems the transmitted signal was originally created in a klystron or traveling wave tube or similar device, which are relatively large. Receiver electronics were also large due to the high frequencies that they worked with. The introduction of gallium arsenide microelectronics through the 1980s served to greatly reduce the size of the receiver elements until effective ones could be built at sizes similar to those of handheld radios, only a few cubic centimeters in volume. The introduction of JFETs and MESFETs did the same to the transmitter side of the systems as well. It gave rise to amplifier-transmitters with a low-power solid-state waveform generator feeding an amplifier, allowing any radar so equipped to transmit on a much wider range of frequencies, to the point of changing operating frequency with every pulse sent out. Shrinking the entire assembly (the transmitter, receiver and antenna) into a single &quot;transmitter-receiver module&quot; (TRM) about the size of a carton of milk and arraying these elements produces an AESA.

The primary advantage of an AESA over a PESA is the capability of the different modules to operate on different frequencies. Unlike the PESA, where the signal is generated at single frequencies by a small number of transmitters, in the AESA each module generates and radiates its own independent signal. This allows the AESA to produce numerous simultaneous &quot;sub-beams&quot; that it can recognize due to different frequencies, and actively track a much larger number of targets. AESAs can also produce beams that consist of many different frequencies at once, using post-processing of the combined signal from a number of TRMs to re-create a display as if there was a single powerful beam being sent. However, this means that the noise present in each frequency is also received and added.

==Advantages==
AESAs add many capabilities of their own to those of the PESAs. Among these are: the ability to form multiple beams simultaneously, to use groups of TRMs for different roles concurrently, like radar detection, and, more importantly, their multiple simultaneous beams and scanning frequencies create difficulties for traditional, correlation-type radar detectors.

===Low probability of intercept===

Radar systems work by sending out a signal and then listening for its echo off distant objects. Each of these paths, to and from the target, is subject to the inverse square law of propagation in both the transmitted signal and the signal reflected back. That means that a radar&#x27;s received energy drops with the fourth power of the distance, which is why radar systems require high powers, often in the megawatt range, to be effective at long range.

The radar signal being sent out is a simple radio signal, and can be received with a simple radio receiver. Military aircraft and ships have defensive receivers, called &quot;radar warning receivers&quot; (RWR), which detect when an enemy radar beam is on them, thus revealing the position of the enemy. Unlike the radar unit, which must send the pulse out and then receive its reflection, the target&#x27;s receiver does not need the reflection and thus the signal drops off only as the square of distance. This means that the receiver is always at an advantage [neglecting disparity in antenna size] over the radar in terms of range – it will always be able to detect the signal long before the radar can see the target&#x27;s echo. Since the position of the radar is extremely useful information in an attack on that platform, this means that radars generally must be turned off for lengthy periods if they are subject to attack; this is common on ships, for instance.

Unlike the radar, which knows which direction it is sending its signal, the receiver simply gets a pulse of energy and has to interpret it. Since the radio spectrum is filled with noise, the receiver&#x27;s signal is integrated over a short period of time, making periodic sources like a radar add up and stand out over the random background. The rough direction can be calculated using a rotating antenna, or similar passive array using phase or amplitude comparison. Typically RWRs store the detected pulses for a short period of time, and compare their broadcast frequency and pulse repetition frequency against a database of known radars. The direction to the source is normally combined with symbology indicating the likely purpose of the radar – airborne early warning and control, surface-to-air missile, etc.

This technique is much less useful against a radar with a frequency-agile (solid state) transmitter. Since the AESA (or PESA) can change its frequency with every pulse (except when using doppler filtering), and generally does so using a random sequence, integrating over time does not help pull the signal out of the background noise. Moreover, a radar may be designed to extend the duration of the pulse and lower its peak power. An AESA or modern PESA will often have the capability to alter these parameters during operation. This makes no difference to the total energy reflected by the target but makes the detection of the pulse by an RWR system less likely. Nor does the AESA have any sort of fixed pulse repetition frequency, which can also be varied and thus hide any periodic brightening across the entire spectrum. Older generation RWRs are essentially useless against AESA radars, which is why AESAs are also known as &quot;low probability of intercept radars&quot;. Modern RWRs must be made highly sensitive (small angles and bandwidths for individual antennas, low transmission loss and noise) and add successive pulses through time-frequency processing to achieve useful detection rates.

===High jamming resistance===

Jamming is likewise much more difficult against an AESA. Traditionally, jammers have operated by determining the operating frequency of the radar and then broadcasting a signal on it to confuse the receiver as to which is the &quot;real&quot; pulse and which is the jammer&#x27;s. This technique works as long as the radar system cannot easily change its operating frequency. When the transmitters were based on klystron tubes this was generally true, and radars, especially airborne ones, had only a few frequencies to choose among. A jammer could listen to those possible frequencies and select the one to be used to jam.

Most radars using modern electronics are capable of changing their operating frequency with every pulse. This can make jamming less effective; although it is possible to send out broadband white noise to conduct barrage jamming against all the possible frequencies, this reduces the amount of jammer energy in any one frequency. An AESA has the additional capability of spreading its frequencies across a wide band even in a single pulse, a technique known as a &quot;chirp&quot;. In this case, the jamming will be the same frequency as the radar for only a short period, while the rest of the radar pulse is unjammed.

AESAs can also be switched to a receive-only mode, and use these powerful jamming signals to track its source, something that required a separate receiver in older platforms. By integrating received signals from the targets&#x27; own radar along with a lower rate of data from its own broadcasts, a detection system with a precise RWR like an AESA can generate more data with less energy. Some receive beamforming-capable systems, usually ground-based, may even discard a transmitter entirely.

However, using a single receiving antenna only gives a direction. Obtaining a range and a target vector requires at least two physically separate passive devices for triangulation to provide instantaneous determinations, unless phase interferometry is used. Target motion analysis can estimate these quantities by incorporating many directional measurements over time, along with knowledge of the position of the receiver and constraints on the possible motion of the target.

===Other advantages===
Since each element in an AESA is a powerful radio receiver, active arrays have many roles besides traditional radar. One use is to dedicate several of the elements to reception of common radar signals, eliminating the need for a separate radar warning receiver. The same basic concept can be used to provide traditional radio support, and with some elements also broadcasting, form a very high bandwidth data link. The F-35 uses this mechanism to send sensor data between aircraft in order to provide a synthetic picture of higher resolution and range than any one radar could generate. In 2007, tests by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and L-3 Communications enabled the AESA system of a Raptor to act like a WiFi access point, able to transmit data at 548 megabits per second and receive at gigabit speed; this is far faster than the Link 16 system used by US and allied aircraft, which transfers data at just over 1 Mbit/s. To achieve these high data rates requires a highly directional antenna which AESA provides but which precludes reception by other units not within the antennas beamwidth, whereas like most Wi-Fi designs, Link-16 transmits its signal omni-directionally to ensure all units within range can receive the data.

AESAs are also much more reliable than either PESAs or older designs. Since each module operates independently of the others, single failures have little effect on the operation of the system as a whole. Additionally, the modules individually operate at low powers, perhaps 40 to 60 watts, so the need for a large high-voltage power supply is eliminated.

Replacing a mechanically scanned array with a fixed AESA mount (such as on the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet) can help reduce an aircraft&#x27;s overall radar cross-section (RCS), but some designs (such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and Gripen NG) forgo this advantage in order to combine mechanical scanning with electronic scanning and provide a wider angle of total coverage. This high off-nose pointing allows the AESA equipped fighter to employ a crossing the T maneuver, often referred to as &quot;beaming&quot; in the context of air-to-air combat, against a mechanically scanned radar that would filter out the low closing speed of the perpendicular flight as ground clutter while the AESA swivels 40 degrees towards the target in order to keep it within the AESA&#x27;s 60 degree off-angle limit.

==Limitations==
With a half wavelength distance between the elements, the maximum beam angle is approximately formula_1°. With a shorter element distance, the highest field of view (FOV) for a flat phased-array antenna is currently 120° (formula_2°), although this can be combined with mechanical steering as noted above.

<text>Venus Express (VEX) was the first Venus exploration mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). Launched in November 2005, it arrived at Venus in April 2006 and began continuously sending back science data from its polar orbit around Venus. Equipped with seven scientific instruments, the main objective of the mission was the long term observation of the Venusian atmosphere. The observation over such long periods of time had never been done in previous missions to Venus, and was key to a better understanding of the atmospheric dynamics. ESA concluded the mission in December 2014.

==History==
The mission was proposed in 2001 to reuse the design of the &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission. However, some mission characteristics led to design changes: primarily in the areas of thermal control, communications and electrical power. For example, since Mars is approximately twice as far from the Sun as Venus, the radiant heating of the spacecraft is four times greater for &quot;Venus Express&quot; than &quot;Mars Express&quot;. Also, the ionizing radiation environment is harsher. On the other hand, the more intense illumination of the solar panels results in more generated photovoltaic power. The &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission also uses some spare instruments developed for the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft. The mission was proposed by a consortium led by D. Titov (Germany), E. Lellouch (France) and F. Taylor (United Kingdom).

The launch window for &quot;Venus Express&quot; was open from 26 October to 23 November 2005, with the launch initially set for 26 October 4:43 UTC. However, problems with the insulation from the Fregat upper stage led to a two-week launch delay to inspect and clear out the small insulation debris that migrated on the spacecraft. It was eventually launched by a Soyuz-FG/Fregat rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 9 November 2005 at 03:33:34 UTC into a parking Earth orbit and 1 h 36 min after launch put into its transfer orbit to Venus. A first trajectory correction maneuver was successfully performed on 11 November 2005. It arrived at Venus on 11 April 2006, after 153 days of journey, and fired its main engine between 07:10:29 and 08:00:42 UTC SCET to reduce its velocity so that it could be captured by Venusian gravity into a nine-day orbit of . The burn was monitored from ESA&#x27;s Control Centre, ESOC, in Darmstadt, Germany.

Seven further orbit control maneuvers, two with the main engine and five with the thrusters, were required for &quot;Venus Express&quot; to reach its final operational 24-hour orbit around Venus.

&quot;Venus Express&quot; entered its target orbit at apoapsis on 7 May 2006 at 13:31 UTC, when the spacecraft was from Earth. At this point the spacecraft was running on an ellipse substantially closer to the planet than during the initial orbit. The polar orbit ranged between over Venus. The periapsis was located almost above the North pole (80° North latitude), and it took 24 hours for the spacecraft to travel around the planet.

&quot;Venus Express&quot; studied the Venusian atmosphere and clouds in detail, the plasma environment and the surface characteristics of Venus from orbit. It also made global maps of the Venusian surface temperatures. Its nominal mission was originally planned to last for 500 Earth days (approximately two Venusian sidereal days), but the mission was extended five times: first on 28 February 2007 until early May 2009; then on 4 February 2009 until 31 December 2009; and then on 7 October 2009 until 31 December 2012. On 22 November 2010, the mission was extended to 2014. On 20 June 2013, the mission was extended a final time until 2015.

On 28 November 2014, mission control lost contact with &quot;Venus Express&quot;. Intermittent contact was reestablished on 3 December 2014, though there was no control over the spacecraft, likely due to exhaustion of propellant. On 16 December 2014, ESA announced that the &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission had ended. A carrier signal was still being received from the vehicle, but no data was being transmitted. Mission manager Patrick Martin expected the spacecraft would fall below in early January 2015, with destruction occurring in late January or early February. The spacecraft&#x27;s carrier signal was last detected by ESA on 18 January 2015.

==Instruments==
ASPERA-4: An acronym for &quot;Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms,&quot; ASPERA-4 investigated the interaction between the solar wind and the Venusian atmosphere, determine the impact of plasma processes on the atmosphere, determine global distribution of plasma and neutral gas, study energetic neutral atoms, ions and electrons, and analyze other aspects of the near Venus environment. ASPERA-4 is a re-use of the ASPERA-3 design used on &quot;Mars Express&quot;, but adapted for the harsher near-Venus environment.

MAG: The magnetometer was designed to measure the strength of Venus&#x27;s magnetic field and the direction of it as affected by the solar wind and Venus itself. It mapped the magnetosheath, magnetotail, ionosphere, and magnetic barrier in high resolution in three-dimensions, aid ASPERA-4 in the study of the interaction of the solar wind with the atmosphere of Venus, identify the boundaries between plasma regions, and carry planetary observations as well (such as the search for and characterization of Venus lightning). MAG was derived from the &quot;Rosetta&quot; lander&#x27;s ROMAP instrument.

One measuring device was placed on the body of the craft. The identical second of the pair was placed the necessary distance away from the body by unfolding a 1 m long boom (carbon composite tube). Two redundant pyrotechnical cutters cut one loop of thin rope to free the power of metal springs. The driven knee lever rotated the boom perpendicularly outwards and latched it in place. Only the use of a pair of sensors together with the rotation of the probe allowed the spacecraft to resolve the small natural magnetic field beneath the disturbing fields of the probe itself. The measurements to identify the fields produced by the craft took place on the route from Earth to Venus. The lack of magnetic cleanness was due to the reuse of the &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft bus, which did not carry a magnetometer. By combining the data from two-point simultaneous measurements and using software to identify and remove interference generated by &quot;Venus Express&quot; itself, it was possible to obtain results of a quality comparable to those produced by a magnetically clean craft.

VMC: The Venus Monitoring Camera is a wide-angle, multi-channel CCD. The VMC is designed for global imaging of the planet. It operated in the visible (VIS), ultraviolet (UV), and near infrared (NIR1 and NIR2) spectral ranges, and maps surface brightness distribution searching for volcanic activity, monitoring airglow, studying the distribution of unknown ultraviolet absorbing phenomenon at the cloud-tops, and making other science observations. It was derived in part from the &quot;Mars Express&quot; High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the &quot;Rosetta&quot; Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System (OSIRIS). The camera is based on a Kodak KAI-1010 Series, 1024 x 1024 pixel interline CCD, and included an FPGA to pre-process image data, reducing the amount transmitted to Earth. The consortium of institutions responsible for the VMC included the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center and the Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering at Technische Universität Braunschweig. It is not to be confused with Visual Monitoring Camera mounted on &quot;Mars Express&quot;, of which it is an evolution.
PFS: The &quot;Planetary Fourier Spectrometer&quot; (PFS) should have operated in the infrared between the 0.9 μm and 45 μm wavelength range and was designed to perform vertical optical sounding of the Venus atmosphere. It should have performed global, long-term monitoring of the three-dimensional temperature field in the lower atmosphere (cloud level up to 100 kilometers). Furthermore, it should have searched for minor atmospheric constituents that may be present, but had not yet been detected, analyzed atmospheric aerosols, and investigated surface to atmosphere exchange processes. The design was based on a spectrometer on &quot;Mars Express&quot;, but modified for optimal performance for the &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission. However PFS failed during its deployment and no useful data was transmitted. 

SPICAV: The &quot;SPectroscopy for Investigation of Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Venus&quot; (SPICAV) is an imaging spectrometer that was used for analyzing radiation in the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. It was derived from the &quot;SPICAM&quot; instrument flown on &quot;Mars Express&quot;. However, SPICAV had an additional channel known as SOIR (Solar Occultation at Infrared) that was used to observe the Sun through Venus&#x27;s atmosphere in the infrared.

VIRTIS: The &quot;Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer&quot; (VIRTIS) was an imaging spectrometer that observed in the near-ultraviolet, visible, and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It analyzed all layers of the atmosphere, surface temperature and surface/atmosphere interaction phenomena.

VeRa: Venus Radio Science was a radio sounding experiment that transmitted radio waves from the spacecraft and passed them through the atmosphere or reflected them off the surface. These radio waves were received by a ground station on Earth for analysis of the ionosphere, atmosphere and surface of Venus. It was derived from the Radio Science Investigation instrument flown on &quot;Rosetta&quot;.

===Climate of Venus===
Starting out in the early planetary system with similar sizes and chemical compositions, the histories of Venus and Earth have diverged in spectacular fashion. It is hoped that the &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission data that was obtained can contribute not only to an in-depth understanding of how the Venusian atmosphere is structured, but also to an understanding of the changes that led to the current greenhouse atmospheric conditions. Such an understanding may contribute to the study of climate change on Earth.

In 2006, its research result identified the differences between Venus and Earth and started to observe routine climate changes.

&quot;Venus Express&quot; was also used to observe signs of life on Earth from Venus orbit. In images acquired by the probe, Earth was less than one pixel in size, which mimics observations of Earth-sized planets in other planetary systems. These observations were then used to develop methods for habitability studies of exoplanets.

<text>An Alderson disk (named after Dan Alderson, its originator) is a hypothetical artificial astronomical megastructure, like Larry Niven&#x27;s Ringworld and the Dyson sphere. The disk is a giant platter with a thickness of several thousand miles. The Sun rests in the hole at the center of the disk. The outer perimeter of an Alderson disk would be roughly equivalent to the orbit of Mars or Jupiter. According to the proposal, a sufficiently large disk would have more mass than its Sun.

The hole would be surrounded by a thousand-mile-high wall to prevent the atmosphere from drifting into the Sun. The outer rim would not require a wall.

The mechanical stresses within the disc would be far beyond what any known material can stand, thus relegating such a structure to the realm of exploratory engineering until materials and construction science become sufficiently advanced. Building a megastructure of this magnitude would require an amount of material that far surpasses the amount of material found in the Solar System.

Life could exist on either side of the disk, though life in close proximity to the sun would be impossible without sufficient heat protection. Conversely, beings residing far away from the Sun would freeze without the requisite heating equipment. Therefore, for the entirety of such a structure to be made habitable, it would have to include a vast number of life support systems. Even without such systems, the habitable surface area would be an equivalent of tens to hundreds of millions of Earths.

Since the Sun remains stationary, there is no day/night cycle, only a perpetual twilight. This could be solved by forcing the Sun to bob up and down within the disk, lighting one side and then the other.

==In popular culture==
In 1974, the science fiction writer Larry Niven suggested that an Alderson disk &quot;would be a wonderful place to stage a gothic or sword and sorcery novel. The atmosphere is right, and there are real monsters.&quot; Since the zone habitable by humans is &#x27;relatively narrow&#x27; (5% closer in and further out than Earth&#x27;s current orbit would provide 50 million times the surface area of Earth), the disc (and the cost of its construction) could be shared with aliens from hotter and colder planets. Over long periods of time, lifeforms would evolve to settle the sparsely-inhabited regions in between. &quot;If civilization should fall, things could get eerie and interesting.&quot;

An Alderson disk (the &quot;Godwheel&quot;) was a prominent feature of Malibu Comics&#x27; Ultraverse. The Godwheel was split between two societies, one which used technology and one which used magic (each occupied its own side of the disk). Larry Niven designed the Godwheel and wrote stories surrounding certain events on it.

Rak Mesba is a partial ancient alien Alderson Disk in Orion&#x27;s Arm, a multi-authored online science fiction world-building project.

A disk-shaped planet similar to an Alderson disk (though far smaller) served as the homeworld of the fantasy &quot;Aysle&quot; setting (or &quot;cosm&quot;) of West End Games&#x27; &quot;Torg&quot; roleplaying game. In contrast with the Alderson disk, the Aysle &quot;diskworld&quot; works according to fantasy physics, including a &quot;gravity plane&quot; that bisects the disk laterally, so that opposite sides &quot;fall&quot; towards the plane. The diskworld of Aysle had a bobbing Sun and multiple inner layers. Both sides of the disk were inhabited, as were the internal layers.

In Charles Stross&#x27;s &quot;Missile Gap&quot;, a copy of the whole Earth (along with copies of many other planets) is placed on an Alderson disk built around a black hole by unknown forces.

Ian McDonald&#x27;s novel &quot;Empress of the Sun&quot; features a parallel-universe version of our solar system where creatures evolved from dinosaurs have converted all the mass to an Alderson disk (with a bobbing sun).

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Strata&quot; the concept of an Alderson disk is brought up by the protagonist, Kin Arad, as an explanation for the mysterious &#x27;flat earth&#x27; that is the focus of the story.

In Gigastructural Engineering &amp; More, a popular modification to the 4X game &quot;Stellaris&quot;, the Alderson Disk is featured as a buildable megastructure inhabitable by the player.

In the game &quot;&quot;, the planet of Penacony is actually a large artificial space station-like megastructure housing a hotel surrounded by two small Alderson disks orbiting it.

<doc id="839263" wikidata="Q767802" url="?curid=839263" title="The Good Soldier">
<text>The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion is a 1915 novel by the British writer Ford Madox Ford. It is set just before World War I, and chronicles the tragedy of Edward Ashburnham and his seemingly perfect marriage, along with that of his two American friends. The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique that formed part of Ford&#x27;s pioneering view of literary impressionism. Ford employs the device of the unreliable narrator to great effect, as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads the reader to believe. The novel was loosely based on two incidents of adultery and on Ford&#x27;s messy personal life, specifically “the agonies Ford went through with his wife and his mistress in the six preceding years.&quot;

The novel&#x27;s original title was &quot;The Saddest Story&quot;, but after the onset of World War I the publishers asked Ford for a new title. Ford suggested (sarcastically) &quot;The Good Soldier&quot;, and the name stuck.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; 30th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2015, the BBC ranked &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; 13th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels. It has been called &quot;the greatest French novel in English.&quot;

==Plot summary==

&quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is narrated by the character John Dowell, half of one of the couples whose dissolving relationships form the subject of the novel. Dowell tells the story of those dissolutions, plus the deaths of three characters and the madness of a fourth, in a rambling, non-chronological fashion. As an unreliable narrator the reader can consider whether they believe Dowell and his description of how the events unfolded including his own role in the &quot;saddest story ever told&quot;.

===Events as narrated===
The novel opens with the famous line: &quot;This is the saddest story I have ever heard.&quot; Dowell explains that for nine years he, his wife Florence and their friends Captain Edward Ashburnham (the &quot;good soldier&quot; of the book&#x27;s title) and his wife Leonora, had an ostensibly normal friendship while Edward and Florence sought treatment for their heart ailments at a spa in Nauheim, Germany.

As it turns out, nothing in the relationships or in the characters is as it first seems. Florence&#x27;s heart ailment is a fiction she perpetrated on John to ensure that he did not seek intimacy from her as it would seemingly be too stressful for her heart, and so to keep him out of her bedroom at night in order that she could continue her affair with an American artist named Jimmy. Edward and Leonora have an unbalanced marriage broken by his constant infidelities (both of body and heart) and by Leonora&#x27;s attempts to control Edward&#x27;s affairs (both financial and romantic). Dowell is an innocent American who is coming to realise how much he has been fooled as Florence and Edward had an affair under his nose for nine years without his knowing until Florence was dead.

Dowell tells the story of Edward and Leonora&#x27;s relationship which appears normal to others but which is a power struggle that Leonora wins. Dowell narrates several of Edward&#x27;s affairs and peccadilloes including his possibly innocent attempt to comfort a crying servant on a train, his affair with the married Maisie Maidan, the one character in the book whose heart problem was unquestionably real, and his bizarre tryst in Monte Carlo and Antibes with a kept woman known as La Dolciquita. Edward&#x27;s philandering ends up costing them a fortune in bribes, blackmail and gifts for his lovers leading Leonora to take control of Edward&#x27;s financial affairs. She gradually gets him out of debt.

Florence&#x27;s affair with Edward leads her to commit suicide when she realises both that Edward is falling in love with his and Leonora&#x27;s young ward, Nancy Rufford, and that Dowell has found out about her affair with Jimmy. Florence sees Edward and Nancy in an intimate conversation and rushes back to the resort where she sees John talking to a man she used to know (and who knows of her affair with Jimmy). Assuming that her relationship with Edward and her marriage to John are over, Florence takes prussic acid—which she has carried for years in a vial that John thought held her heart medicine—and dies.

Edward&#x27;s last affair is his most scandalous as he becomes infatuated with Nancy. Nancy came to live with the Ashburnhams after leaving a convent where her parents had sent her; her mother was a violent alcoholic and her father (it is later suggested that this man may not be Nancy&#x27;s biological father) may have abused her. Edward, tearing himself apart because he does not want to spoil Nancy&#x27;s innocence, arranges to have her sent to India to live with her father, even though this frightens her terribly. Once Leonora knows that Edward intends to keep his passion for Nancy chaste, only wanting Nancy to continue to love him from afar, she torments him by making this wish impossible. She pretends to offer to divorce him so he can marry Nancy but informs Nancy of his sordid sexual history, destroying Nancy&#x27;s innocent love for him. After Nancy&#x27;s departure, Edward receives a telegram from her that reads, &quot;Safe Brindisi. Having a rattling good time. Nancy.&quot; He asks Dowell to take the telegram to his wife, pulls out his pen knife, says that it is time he had some rest and slits his own throat. When Nancy reaches Aden and sees the obituary in the paper, she becomes catatonic.

The novel&#x27;s last section has Dowell writing from Edward&#x27;s old estate in England where he takes care of Nancy whom he cannot marry because of her mental illness. Nancy is only capable of repeating two things—a Latin phrase meaning &quot;I believe in an omnipotent God&quot; and the word &quot;shuttlecocks&quot;. Dowell states that the story is sad because no one got what they wanted. Leonora wanted Edward but lost him and ended up marrying the normal (but dull) Rodney Bayham. Edward wanted Nancy but gave her up then lost her. Dowell wanted a wife but ended up a nurse to two women.

Dowell ends up generally unsure about where to lay the blame, but expressing sympathy for Edward because he believes himself similar to Edward in nature. The fact is he has been disengaged, a voyeur. While the other characters are flawed, he has never participated in life. He is revealed as less than the foolish innocent he represents himself as, when he walks away, leaving Edward to slit his throat with a very small pen knife.

===Textual analysis===

The novel has potential narrative inconsistencies that suggest different, hidden plot elements. For example, Dowell marries an heiress who ostensibly has a bad heart. He states repeatedly that he has no need or interest in her money—one might argue that he protests his lack of interest rather too much. Florence eventually dies, stated by Dowell to be suicide. If readers suspend their trust in the narrator, some may be left with the impression that the narrator is happy his wife dies, as he does little to prevent it, just as he does little throughout the entire book. Thus, behind the more or less explicit narrative lurks a possible counter-narrative in which Dowell is something of a sociopath, caring for no one but himself, an observer of others who are living more fully while never actively engaging very intensely in life himself, and indeed, perhaps a voyeur relishing the demise of others. This would be the story of a manipulative man trying to elicit the sympathy of the audience he speaks/writes to, which must decide whether he is a deluded victim or a heartless manipulator of the reader&#x27;s emotions.

Florence supposedly poisons herself in a possibly painful manner, and Edward supposedly cuts his own throat, but as always in this novel, we only have Dowell&#x27;s word for it, and he epitomises the &quot;unreliable narrator.&quot; The reader must decide just how much of the truth Dowell reveals. Some commentators have even suggested that Dowell, who presents himself as considered by all to be passive, murders both Florence and Edward. In this view the entire story is his justification for doing so without his admitting his guilt.

Religious references are omnipresent throughout the book. Leonora is an Irish Catholic who cannot contemplate divorce. She is taunted about Catholicism by Florence when they all visit a castle near Nauheim which holds a relic of Martin Luther&#x27;s Protest. Ashburnham is an Anglican by birth who wants to build a Catholic chapel on his property for Leonora and who would have converted to Catholicism had he been spurred to it by his wife, who remains indifferent. 

==Major characters==

* John Dowell: The narrator, husband to Florence. Dowell is an American Quaker. He is either a gullible and passionless man who cannot read the emotions of the people around him or a master manipulator who plays the victim.
* Florence Dowell: John Dowell&#x27;s wife and a scheming, manipulative, unfaithful woman who uses Dowell for his money while pursuing her affairs on the side. She fakes a heart ailment to get what she wants out of her husband and has a lengthy affair with Edward Ashburnham.
* Edward Ashburnham: Friend of the Dowells and husband of Leonora. Ashburnham is a hopeless romantic who keeps falling in love with the women he meets. He is at Nauheim for the treatment of a heart problem, but the ailment is not real; he used it as an excuse to follow a female heart patient to Nauheim. He is Dowell&#x27;s opposite, a virile, physical, passionate man.
* Leonora Ashburnham: Edward&#x27;s wife by a marriage that was more or less arranged by their fathers. Leonora comes to resent Edward&#x27;s philandering as much for its effect on her life as on her marriage and asserts more and more control over Edward until he dies.
* Nancy Rufford: The young ward of the Ashburnhams. Edward falls in love with Nancy after he tires of Florence. Eventually, Edward arranges for Nancy to be sent to India to live with her father, but she goes mad en route when she learns of Edward&#x27;s death.
* La Dolciquita: A Spanish dancer (The Grand Duke&#x27;s mistress) who is Edward&#x27;s first sexual affair. Although he believes himself to be romantically attached to her, he quickly becomes disillusioned by her thirst for his money.
* Maisie Maidan: A young, pretty, married woman with whom Edward falls in love. Leonora pays for her treatment for a weak heart at Nauheim, knowing that Edward would follow her there. Maisie&#x27;s heart gives way after she hears Florence and Edward talking about her disparagingly and she dies.

== Character analysis ==
How well can we judge the characterisations in the novel when Dowell is such an unreliable narrator? A question to consider is whether he presented himself in a true light or manipulated his description of events to prevent the reader from discovering his true character. However&quot;by the end of the novel Dowell has tested the limits of rational explanation. He has interpreted character by religion, nationality, gender and the calendar. Dowell&#x27;s disillusionment follows the arc of modernism; he begins with presuppositions typical of much Victorian characterization: the individual conditioned by circumstance, composed of intelligible motives, susceptible to moral analysis-the justified self. Then, confronted with the singularity of desire, his &#x27;generalizations&#x27; totter and fall.&quot;Dowell admits that his assumptions and characterisations of the people in his life may be flawed.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted into the television film of the same title by Granada Television in 1981. It starred Jeremy Brett, Vickery Turner, Robin Ellis and Susan Fleetwood. It was directed by Kevin Billington and written by Julian Mitchell. In the US it aired as part of the &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; series.

The novel was adapted as a BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime by Lu Kemp in 2008, read by Toby Stephens and produced by Kirsty Williams.

In 2020 the novel was adapted by Sebastian Baczkiewicz as a one hour radio play as part of the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Electric Decade&quot; season of classic titles that influenced and characterised the Jazz Age of the 1920s.

<doc id="839270" wikidata="Q1248585" url="?curid=839270" title="The Golden Bowl">
<text>The Golden Bowl is a 1904 novel by Henry James. Set in England, this complex, intense study of marriage and adultery completes what some critics have called the &quot;major phase&quot; of James&#x27;s career. &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; explores the tangle of interrelationships between a father and daughter and their respective spouses. The novel focuses deeply and almost exclusively on the consciousness of the central characters, with sometimes obsessive detail but also with powerful insight.

== Plot summary ==

Prince Amerigo, an impoverished but charismatic Italian nobleman, is in London for his marriage to Maggie Verver, only child of the widower Adam Verver, the fabulously wealthy American financier and art collector. While there, he re-encounters Charlotte Stant, another young American and a former mistress from his days in Rome; they had met in Mrs. Assingham&#x27;s drawing room. Charlotte is not wealthy, which is one reason they did not marry. Although Maggie and Charlotte have been dear friends since childhood, Maggie does not know of Charlotte&#x27;s and Amerigo&#x27;s past relationship. Charlotte and Amerigo go shopping together for a wedding present for Maggie. They find a curiosity shop where the shopkeeper offers them an antique gilded crystal bowl. Charlotte lacks the money to buy the bowl and the Prince declines to purchase it, as he suspects it contains a hidden flaw.

After Maggie has married, afraid that her father has become lonely, as they had been close for years, she persuades him to propose to Charlotte, who accepts Adam&#x27;s proposal. Soon after the wedding, Charlotte and Amerigo are thrown together, because their respective spouses seem more interested in their father-daughter relationship than in their marriages. Amerigo and Charlotte kiss and later spend a day together visiting a cathedral and an inn but whether or not they have sex remains ambiguous.

Maggie begins to suspect the pair. She happens to go to the same shop and buys the golden bowl they had rejected. Regretting the high price he has charged her, the shopkeeper visits Maggie and confesses to overcharging. At her home, he sees photographs of Amerigo and Charlotte. He tells Maggie of the pair&#x27;s shopping trip on the eve of her marriage and their intimate conversation in his shop. (They had spoken Italian, but he understands the language.)

Maggie confronts Amerigo. She begins a secret campaign to separate him and Charlotte while never revealing their affair to her father. Also concealing her knowledge from Charlotte and denying any change to their friendship, she gradually persuades her father to return to America with his wife. After previously regarding Maggie as a naïve, immature American, the Prince seems impressed by his wife&#x27;s delicate diplomacy. The novel ends with Adam and Charlotte Verver about to depart for the United States. Amerigo says he can &quot;see nothing but&quot; Maggie and embraces her.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The Golden Bowl&#x27;s&quot; intense focus on its four main characters gives the novel both its tremendous power and its peculiar feeling of claustrophobia. Henry James himself had a high regard for his last work, describing it to his American publisher as &quot;distinctly the most done of my productions ― the most composed and constructed and completed...I hold the thing the solidest, as yet, of all my fictions.&quot; 

Created during what critics label James&#x27;s third phase of writing, &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; showcases the dense prose (often called James&#x27;s &quot;late style&quot;) that characterises his final novels. Although the narrative is very focused compared to his earlier works, with minimal characters, the writing is complex and elaborate. Gore Vidal attributed this verbosity in part to James&#x27;s habit at the time of dictating his novels to stenographers rather than typing the manuscript himself. Vidal thought the style of &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot;, as well as &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1902) and &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1903), mimicked James&#x27;s own rhetorical manner, which was &quot;endlessly complex, humorous, unexpected - euphemistic where most people are direct and suddenly precise where avoidance or ellipsis is usual...&quot; 

Robert McCrum included the novel in &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; list of 100 Best Novels, describing it as an &quot;amazing, labyrinthine, terrifying and often claustrophobic narrative.&quot; Author Colm Toibin called &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; Henry James&#x27;s best work, in part because James &quot;stripped down&quot; the number of characters to four. He describes James&#x27;s style of expressing consciousness as &quot;a system of clauses, sub-clauses, modifications, qualifications and in some cases ruminations&quot;, which anticipates the later styles of stream of consciousness writing by James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. John Banville also compared James&#x27;s modernist stream of consciousness technique, which characterises &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot;, to James Joyce, summarising it as &quot;a style designed to catch, with immense, with fiendish, subtlety, and in sentences of labyrinthine intricacy, the very texture of conscious life.&quot;

The author Rebecca West, on the other hand, said of it that &quot;winter had fallen on [James&#x27;] genius in &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot;.&quot; Critics have noted the overbearing symbolism of the golden bowl, which is eventually broken in a scene that may not be fully effective.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; 32nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

Some critics believe that &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; was an inspiration for Iris Murdoch, a known fan of James, and, in particular, her novel &quot;A Severed Head&quot;.

The title is taken from Ecclesiastes 12: &quot;Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
In 1972, the BBC produced a six-hour televised version that was highly praised, with a screenplay by Jack Pulman, Gayle Hunnicutt as Charlotte, Barry Morse as Adam Verver, Jill Townsend as Maggie, Daniel Massey as the Prince, and Cyril Cusack as Bob Assingham, ingeniously presented as the narrator, commenting on the development of the story very much in the style of Henry James. This version, presented on &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, was more faithful to the book than the later Merchant-Ivory film in the U.S.

In 2000, &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; was filmed by Merchant Ivory Productions, directed by James Ivory, and starred Uma Thurman, Nick Nolte, Kate Beckinsale and Jeremy Northam. In some ways Ruth Prawer Jhabvala&#x27;s adaptation differs from James&#x27;s novel. In the book, Charlotte is a calculating, amoral character who manipulates and manages those around her with a glance or a smile; however, in the movie, Charlotte appears to suffer from some mental disorder, exhibiting symptoms of paranoia and obsessive love.

<text>Guwahati () is the largest city of the Indian state of Assam, and also the largest metropolis in northeastern India. Dispur, the capital of Assam, is in the circuit city region located within Guwahati and is the seat of the Government of Assam. Its airport is the 12th busiest in India, the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. A major riverine port city along with hills, and one of the fastest growing cities in India, Guwahati is situated on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. The city is known as the &quot;gateway to North East India&quot;.

The ancient cities of Pragjyotishpura and Durjaya (North Guwahati) were the capitals of the ancient state of Kamarupa.
Many ancient Hindu temples like the Kamakhya Temple, Ugratara Temple, Basistha Temple, Doul Govinda Temple, Umananda Temple, Navagraha Temple, Sukreswar Temple, Rudreswar Temple, Manikarneswar Devalaya, Aswaklanta Temple, Dirgheshwari Temple, Lankeshwar Temple, Bhubaneswari Temple, Shree Ganesh Mandir, Shree Panchayatana Temple, Noonmati, and the like, are situated in the city, giving it the title of &quot;The City of Temples&quot;. The noted Madan Kamdev is situated from Guwahati.

Guwahati lies between the banks of the Brahmaputra River and the foothills of the Shillong plateau, with LGB International Airport to the west and the town of Narengi to the east. The North Guwahati area, to the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, is being gradually incorporated into the city limits. The Guwahati Municipal Corporation, the city&#x27;s local government, administers an area of . At the same time, the Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is the planning and development body of Greater Guwahati Metropolitan Area. Guwahati is the largest city in Northeast India.

The Guwahati region hosts diverse wildlife including rare animals such as Asian elephants, pythons, tigers, rhinoceros, gaurs, primate species, and endangered birds.

== Etymology ==
Guwahati derives its name from the Assamese word &quot;Guwa&quot; () derived from the Sanskrit word Guvaka, meaning areca nut and its plant and &quot;Hati&quot; () meaning rows, the rows of areca nut trees.

==History==

===Ancient history===
The 10th-12th century Kalika Purana mention that Kamrup was inhabited by strong, cruel Kirata people. As per the legends constructed in the Yogini Tantra, the tank Dighalipukhuri located in the heart of the city was dug by King Bhagadatta of Kamrup on the occasion of the wedding of his daughter Bhanumati with Duryodhan. Located within Guwahati is the Shakti temple of Goddess Kamakhya in Nilachal hill (an important seat of Tantric and Vajrayana Buddhism), the ancient and unique astrological temple Navagraha in Chitrachal Hill, and archaeological remains in Basistha and other archaeological locations of mythological importance.
The Ambari excavations trace the period of the city of Guwahati between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE, in the Shunga-Kushana period of Indian history. Descriptions by Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) reveal that during the reign of the Varman king Bhaskaravarman (7th century CE), the city stretched for about 30 &quot;li&quot; (). Archaeological evidence by excavations in Ambari, and excavated brick walls and houses discovered during construction of the present Cotton College&#x27;s auditorium suggest the city was of economic and strategic importance until the 9th–11th century CE.

===Medieval history===
Koch King Parikshit had his capital at Pragjyotishpur near the Aswatirtha during the conflicts with Mughals. It came under Mughal occupation between (1633–59, 1662–69, 1679–81), their vestige was completely removed after the Battle of Itakhuli.

Guwahati was the headquarters of the Borphukan, Ahom governor of Lower Assam till 1824.The Borphukan&#x27;s residence was in the present Fancy Bazaar area and his council-hall, called &quot;Dopdar&quot;, was about 300 yards (270 m) to the west of the Bharalu stream.The Majindar Baruah, the personal secretary of the Borphukan, had his residence in the present-day deputy commissioner&#x27;s residence. During Ahom period Guwahati was fortified strongly and connected with the country with a number of roads. The Dighalipukhuri was used as a boatyard during this period. During the time of splendor, since the reign of Gadadhar Singha, the Ahom rulers paid their attention to building several temples in various religious sites at Guwahati.

===Colonial history===

On the cession of Assam to the British in 1826, it was made the seat of the British administration of Assam, and so continued until 1874, when the headquarters were removed to Shillong in the Khasi hills.

===Modern history===

The Gauhati High Court (formerly known as the High Court of Assam) was promulgated on 1 March 1948 by the then Governor General of India, Lord Mountbatten, in accordance with the Government of India Act 1935. It became effective on 5 April 1948 and was initially established for the Province of Assam. R.F. Lodge was the inaugural Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court, taking office on 5 April 1948.

The Saraighat Bridge, notable for its role in connecting Northeast India with the rest of the country, was constructed between 1959 and 1962 by the Hindustan Construction Company at a cost of approximately 106 million at the time. It was completed in September 1962, and the first engine crossed it on 23 September 1962.

In 1972, due to separation of Meghalaya from Assam, the capital of Assam was moved to Dispur, a neighbourhood in Guwahati from the erstwhile capital of Shillong.

== Geography ==
The Brahmaputra river flows to the north of the metropolis. The city is bordered on the south by the foothills of the Shillong plateau and to the east by the Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary. The Bharalu River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra, flows right through the heart of the city. To the south-west of the city lies Dipor Bil, a permanent freshwater lake with no prominent inflows apart from monsoon run-off from the hills to the south of the lake. The lake drains into the Brahmaputra, to the north, and acts as a natural stormwater reservoir for the city. There are also multiple hills within the city limits.

=== Urban morphology ===
Guwahati&#x27;s &#x27;urban form&#x27; radiates from a central core with growth corridors radiating and extending towards the south, east, and west. In the past few decades, southern Guwahati areas such as Ganeshguri, Beltola, Hatigaon, Six Mile, and Panjabari began forming a southern sub-center surrounding the capital complex at Dispur. The core area consists of the old city with Pan Bazaar, Paltan Bazaar, Fancy Bazaar and Uzan Bazaar, with each area facilitating unique urban activities.

Among the city corridors, the most important is the corridor formed along the Guwahati-Shillong (GS) Road towards the south (almost from the city-center). The GS Road corridor is an important commercial area with retail, wholesale and commercial offices developed along the main road; it is also a densely built residential area in the inner parts. The capital complex of Assam at Dispur is situated in this corridor. This corridor has facilitated the growth of a southern city sub-center at Ganeshguri, along with other residential areas to the south developed during the past few decades.

The corridor extending towards the west (around from the city center) contains a rail-road linking not only Guwahati but also other parts of the northeastern region east of Guwahati to western Assam and the rest of India. The corridor links residential and historically important areas such as Nilachal Hill (Kamakhya), Pandu, and Maligaon (headquarters of Northeast Frontier Railways) before it separates into two – one towards North Guwahati via the Saraighat Bridge and the other continuing west towards LGB International Airport via Gauhati University (Jalukbari). There are also many river ports/jetties along this corridor.

The third major corridor extends towards the east (around from the city-center) linking Noonmati (Guwahati Refinery) and Narengi, and has facilitated residential growth along with it. Highway NH-37, which encircles the city&#x27;s southern parts and links the southern corridor in Noumile to the western corridor in Jalukbari is currently supporting rapid development. Similarly, the VIP Road linking Zoo Road with the eastern corridor and recently completed Hengerabari-Narengi Road are also supporting massive residential development to the east.

Guwahati is one among 98 Indian cities proposed to become Smart Cities under a project embarked on by Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India.

===Climate===
Guwahati has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwa&quot;), falling just short of a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;).

Highest recorded temperature: on 24 April 2014.

Lowest recorded temperature: on 30 January 1964.

Guwahati has been ranked 36th best “National Clean Air City” under (Category 2 3-10L Population cities) in India.

==Infrastructure==

The city has a comparatively high quality of life. A 2006 survey ranked Guwahati 17th among all the large and medium-sized Indian cities. The city provides competitive residential and working environments with beautiful landscapes, pleasant climate, modern shopping areas, modern apartments, and bungalows, and considerably developed social infrastructure. A centrally funded four-lane, ambitious East-West Corridor will pass through Guwahati and connect all the state capitals of Northeast India. Completion of the project will boost the vital upliftment of the whole region.

The city still needs attention to improve its infrastructure. Funding from the Asian Development Bank is providing assistance to improve Guwahati&#x27;s transportation infrastructure along with a substantial amount from Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) for its development.

==Administration and governance==

Dispur, the capital of Assam, lies in Guwahati. The passing of the North Eastern (Reorganization Areas) Act in 1971 by the Indian Parliament accorded Meghalaya the status of a full-fledged state. After the creation of Meghalaya as a separate state, Shillong continued to be the joint capital of both Assam and Meghalaya. However, in 1972, the Government of Assam decided to shift the capital to Dispur. Accordingly, the first sitting of the Budget Session of the Assam Legislative Assembly was held at Dispur on 16 March 1973. Dispur houses the Secretariat of Assam Government, the Assam Assembly House, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) Regional Office, the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd (NEDFi) House and the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC).

Guwahati Municipal Corporation is the local body responsible for governing, developing and managing the city. It is divided into 60 municipal wards. Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is an agency responsible for planning and development of the greater Guwahati Metropolitan Area and for revising the Guwahati Master Plan and Building Bylaws to cover an area of by 2025.

Guwahati consists of four assembly constituencies: Jalukbari, Dispur, Gauhati East and Gauhati West, all of which are part of Gauhati (Lok Sabha constituency).

===Police===
Guwahati is the headquarters of Assam Police.

The city is under the Police Commissionerate of Guwahati headed by the Commissioner of Police, Guwahati. It is divided into three districts: East Police District, Central Police District, and West Police District, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police. Each police district consists of officers, not below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police, functioning as executive magistrates within a said metropolitan area.

===Judiciary===

Guwahati is the principal seat of the Gauhati High Court. It acts as the High Court of Assam and also of Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh with their outlying benches of Kohima, Aizawl and Itanagar, respectively. Gauhati High Court came in effect from 5 April 1948. It initially had its sittings at Shillong but was shifted to Gauhati from 14 August 1948.

Guwahati also houses the Court of the District and Sessions Judge, Kamrup established in 1920. It is a lower court of the district judiciary having territorial jurisdiction over the greater Guwahati area only.

===Problems===
==== Increase in population ====
In recent years, Guwahati has experienced rapid population growth due to migration for education and employment opportunities. This population increase has led to undesirable expansion of the city and has resulted in various collateral problems, such as the rise in the number of slums. It is projected that the population of Guwahati will reach 1.5 million by 2035, up from an estimated 1.1 million in 2020.

==== Inflation ====
One of the economic problems that the citizens of Guwahati have to put up with is the hike in prices of many essentials, chiefly vegetables, poultry, and fish. The prices of these commodities keep escalating at an inordinate rate, so that consumers find it difficult to buy these items. Vegetables are transported into Assam from West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra and Meghalaya and the truckers en route have to pay substantial fees as tax at various check posts. It is one of the causes of rise in prices of vegetables in the markets of Guwahati. The prices of locally available vegetables and fruits undergo large markup because of transportation expenses grounds, besides intra-State check posts taxes. In addition to these, the wholesale dealers, as well as the retail sellers, augment the prices of the commodities according to their own desires.

The price of poultry, mainly chicken, that reaches the city markets from places like Chaygaon and Barpeta have been soaring rapidly because of similar factors. There has been steep rise in the price of fish as well, the prominent varieties of which being Rohu (&quot;Rou&quot;), Catla (&quot;Bahu&quot;), Walking catfish (&quot;Magur&quot;) and Monopterus (&quot;Kuchia&quot;) among many others.

The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated inflation, causing food prices to rise.

==== Flooding ====
According to experts, urban flooding in Guwahati in the near future is expected to worsen to the point where residents of certain areas may be forced to relocate. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the alteration of drainage channels and wetlands due to rapid urbanization has exacerbated the problem of flooding.

Professor Abani Kumar Bhagawati of Gauhati University stated that since before there were sufficient wetlands to absorb rainwater and channels to carry excess water to the Brahmaputra, the city did not experience floods. However, human interference has disrupted the natural topography, leading to the current situation where &quot;just half an hour of rain&quot; can cause flooding in the city. Encroachment and concretization, which reduce open areas for natural water absorption, are the primary causes of floods according to Bhagawati.

==== Pollution ====
Guwahati was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in a 2023 report published by IQAir, behind Begusarai and ahead of Delhi, reflecting India&#x27;s status as the country with the third highest level of pollution after Bangladesh and Pakistan.

<text>Richard Raymond Radatz (April 2, 1937 – March 16, 2005) was an American relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. Nicknamed &quot;The Monster&quot;, the , right-hander had a scorching but short-lived period of dominance for the Boston Red Sox in the early 1960s. Radatz is reported to have gotten his nickname during a game against the New York Yankees in Boston in 1963. Radatz came in to pitch with the basis loaded and no one out. Radatz consecutively struck out Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Elston Howard, and Mantle grumbled about Radatz being &quot;that monster&quot;. Over his career Radatz struck out Baseball hall of famer Mantle 12 times in 16 at-bats.

==Early years==
Born in Detroit, Radatz was the first child of Virginia (Osterman) and Norman Radatz, an automotive engineer and body design draftsman. Radatz grew up in Berkley, Michigan, in the same neighborhood that produced Detroit Tigers pitcher Hal Newhouser. Norman Radatz had known Newhouser when Newhouser was young, and Dick Radatz grew up admiring Newhouser. Radatz attended Berkley High School, where he played football, baseball, and basketball.

He was a star basketball and baseball player at Michigan State University before signing with the Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1959. Another future MLB relief pitcher, Ron Perranoski, was Radatz&#x27;s roommate at Michigan State. In 1957, Radatz and Perranoski played for the Watertown Lake Sox of the Basin League in South Dakota, where he had a 10-1 record. Radatz returned in 1958 and led the Basin League with 107 strike outs. As a Michigan State senior, he was 10–1 with a 1.12 ERA. Originally a starting pitcher when he began his professional career, Radatz compiled a 16–10 record and 3.48 earned run average in his first two seasons in the Red Sox farm system.

A sore arm led Seattle Rainiers manager Johnny Pesky to convert him into a reliever in 1961 against Radatz&#x27;s will. The experiment worked, as Radatz earned a job out of spring training the following season as a non-roster invitee.

==&quot;Sporting News&quot; &quot;Fireman of the Year&quot;==
Radatz was immediately dominant at the major league level, as he pitched 18.1 innings and recorded six saves before surrendering his first earned run on May 15, 1962, against the Yankees (a game which the Red Sox won, and Radatz earned his seventh save). He went on to lead the American League in saves (24), games (62) and relief wins (9), while posting a 2.24 ERA in 124.2 innings his rookie season, earning the AL&#x27;s Fireman of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Yankee manager Ralph Houk, who said, &quot;For two seasons, I&#x27;ve never seen a better pitcher,&quot; added Radatz to his 1963 AL All-Star squad after a 33 scoreless inning streak saw his ERA dip to 0.88 on June 14. He gave up one earned run in two innings pitched, but impressed with strikeouts of Willie Mays, Dick Groat, Duke Snider, Willie McCovey and Julián Javier. For the season, he saved 23 games and went 15–6 with a 1.97 ERA, becoming the first pitcher in history to have consecutive 20-save seasons and finishing fifth in MVP voting despite Boston&#x27;s seventh-place finish.

The Red Sox toyed with the idea of converting Radatz back into a starter for the 1964 season. Instead, he remained in the bullpen, and earned his second Fireman of the Year award in 1964 for his league-leading 29 saves with 16 wins and a 2.29 ERA in 79 games. Most notably, he fanned 181 batters in 157 innings, setting a record that still stands for most strikeouts by a relief pitcher in a single season. He was named to the AL&#x27;s All-Star Game pitching staff again in 1964, and struck out the first two batters he faced when he entered the game in the eighth inning. He was, however, unable to hold onto the AL&#x27;s 4–3 lead, as he surrendered four runs in the ninth, including a game ending three-run home run by Johnny Callison.

==Boston Red Sox==

Radatz got off to a poor start to the 1965 season, blowing three save opportunities and posting a 7.54 ERA through May 14. He settled down, bringing his ERA down to a far more respectable 3.91 and earning 22 saves by season&#x27;s end, but his 9–11 mark was the first losing record he had posted in his major league career. Radatz&#x27;s only career home run came off the Kansas City Athletics&#x27; Jesse Hickman on June 5, 1965. He was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997.

Radatz was mentioned in trade rumors with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Milwaukee Braves and Minnesota Twins during the off-season, but eventually returned to the Red Sox. He was 0–2 with a 4.74 ERA before being dealt to the Cleveland Indians on June 2 for Don McMahon and Lee Stange.

Overall with Boston, Radatz saved 104 games (a team record later broken by Bob Stanley) with a 49–34 record and 646 strikeouts in 576.1 innings pitched. With the other four teams, he went only 6–20 with 26 saves in 117.2 innings.

==Cleveland Indians==
Radatz went 0–3 with a 4.61 ERA in Cleveland. He earned a combined 14 saves between his two teams in 1966, marking the first time in his career he failed to reach 20. He also failed to win a game as he ended the season with an 0–5 record.

==Chicago Cubs==
Nine games into the 1967 season, Radatz was dealt to the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later. On June 9, Radatz pitched a scoreless ninth inning against the New York Mets at Wrigley Field to earn his first career win since September 14, 1965. But in 21.2 innings pitched with the Cubs through July 7, Radatz surrendered 12 hits, 23 walks and hit five batters. He was sent down to the minors to work on his control, but was unable to regain it. In 34 innings pitched in the minors, Radatz surrendered 25 hits and 40 walks and hit eight batters.

==Detroit Tigers==
The Cubs released Radatz during spring training of 1968. He signed with his hometown Detroit Tigers shortly afterwards, and spent the 1968 season with their Triple A affiliate Toledo Mud Hens. With Toledo, Dick was 6–7, 2.78 ERA, 24 GP, started 13 games, 5 CG, 3 SHO, 110.O IP, 103 K, 23 BB, and a WHIP of 0.973. He earned a spot on the major league roster out of spring training 1969, and was 2–2 with a 3.32 ERA in 11 appearances when his contract was sold to the Montreal Expos at the June 15 trade deadline. He went 0–4 with a 5.71 ERA for the Expos before he was released in August.

==Later life==
After leaving the game, Radatz worked at a number of jobs, had his own weekly radio show, and was a frequent guest on other sports talk radio shows. Radatz frequently suggested that contemporary relievers weren&#x27;t durable enough and that his own experience was that when he didn&#x27;t get used as much, he lost his edge. A resident of Farmington Hills, Michigan, Radatz moved back to the Greater Boston area in 1984, living in Easton, Massachusetts, where former teammate Jerry Moses had found him a job at a corrugated packaging company, Triple P Packaging. &quot;I felt I had formed a love affair with this town, that I was appreciated by the fans here.&quot; Before his death in 2005, Radatz worked as pitching coach for the North Shore Spirit, an independent league team based in Lynn, Massachusetts. The team was managed by former Red Sox infielder John Kennedy who was expecting Radatz to return for the 2005 season.

Radatz died on March 16, 2005, after falling down a flight of stairs at his home in Easton, Massachusetts. He left behind a wife and three children. The Red Sox held a moment of silence during their 2005 home opener in his honor.

<doc id="839297" wikidata="Q235565" url="?curid=839297" title="Ma Barker">
<text>Kate Barker (born 
Arizona Donnie Clark; October 8, 1873 – January 16, 1935), better known as Ma Barker (and sometimes known as Arizona Barker and Arrie Barker), was the mother of a few American criminals who ran the Barker–Karpis Gang during the &quot;public enemy era&quot; when the exploits of gangs of criminals in the Midwestern United States gripped the American people and press. She traveled with her sons during their criminal careers.

Barker gained a reputation as a ruthless crime matriarch who controlled and organized her sons&#x27; crimes. J. Edgar Hoover described her as &quot;the most vicious, dangerous, and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade&quot;. She has been presented as a monstrous mother in films, songs, and literature. Those who knew her insisted that she had no criminal role and that Hoover created the allegations to justify her shooting by the FBI in 1935. Later reports consistently conclude that Kate Barker&#x27;s role in her sons&#x27; crimes was falsely created by the media to increase newspaper and media sales.

==Family life==
Barker was born Arizona Donnie Clark in Ash Grove, Missouri, the daughter of John and Emaline (Parker) Clark; her family called her &quot;Arrie&quot;. In 1892, she married George Barker in Lawrence County, Missouri, and the couple had four sons: Herman (1893–1927), Lloyd (1897–1949), Arthur (1899–1939), and Fred (1901–1935). The 1910 to 1930 censuses and the Tulsa City Directories from 1916 to 1928 show that George Barker worked in a variety of generally low-paying jobs. From 1916 to 1919, he was at the Crystal Springs Water Co. In the 1920s, he was employed as a farmer, watchman, station engineer, and clerk. An FBI document describes him as &quot;shiftless&quot; and says the Barkers paid no attention to their sons&#x27; education, and they were all &quot;more or less illiterate&quot;.

Barker&#x27;s sons committed crimes as early as 1910, when Herman was arrested for highway robbery after running over a child in the getaway car. Over the next few years, Herman and his brothers were repeatedly involved in crimes of increasing seriousness, including robbery and murder. They were inducted into major crime by the Central Park gang. Herman died on August 29, 1927, in Wichita, Kansas, after a robbery and confrontation with police that left one officer dead. He shot the officer at point-blank range in the mouth. He killed himself to avoid prosecution when he was seriously wounded after crashing his car. In 1928, Lloyd Barker was incarcerated in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, Arthur &quot;Doc&quot; Barker was in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, and Fred was in the Kansas State Penitentiary.

George was last listed living with his wife in the 1928 Tulsa city directory. Either she threw him out, as some say, or he left when life became intolerable with his criminal family. According to writer Miriam Allen deFord, George &quot;gave up completely and quietly removed himself from the scene&quot; after Herman&#x27;s death and the imprisonment of his other sons. The FBI claimed that George left Ma because she had become &quot;loose in her moral life&quot; and was &quot;having outside dates with other men&quot;. They noted that George was not a criminal, but he was willing to profit from his sons&#x27; crimes after their deaths by claiming their assets as next of kin. However, a family friend recalled that the couple argued about their children&#x27;s &quot;dissolute life&quot;. Arrie &quot;countenanced their wrongdoings&quot; while George refused to accept them. The crunch came when George refused to support Lloyd after his arrest, insisting that he should be punished for his crime. Arrie did everything that she could to get her sons exonerated, no matter what they had done.

From 1928 to 1930, Ma lived in &quot;miserable poverty&quot; in a &quot;dirt-floor shack&quot; with no husband and no job, while all her sons were in jail. This may have been when she became &quot;loose&quot; with local men, as the FBI suggested. By 1930, she was living with a jobless man named Arthur W. Dunlop (sometimes spelled &quot;Dunlap&quot;). She is described as his wife on the 1930 census of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Things improved for her in 1931 after her son Fred was released from jail. He joined former prison-mate Alvin Karpis to form the Barker–Karpis Gang. After a series of robberies, Fred and Karpis killed Sheriff C. Roy Kelly in West Plains, Missouri on December 19, 1931, an act that forced them to flee the area. Ma and Dunlop traveled with them, using various false names during their itinerant crime career. A wanted poster issued at this time offered $100 reward for the capture of &quot;Old Lady Arrie Barker&quot; as an accomplice. After this, she was usually known to gang members as &quot;Kate&quot;.

==St. Paul and Wisconsin==
Arthur was released from prison in 1932 and joined Fred and Karpis, and the core gang was supplemented by other criminal associates. The gang moved to Chicago but decided to leave because Karpis did not want to work for Al Capone. Racketeer, Jack Peifer, suggested that they move to St. Paul, Minnesota, which had a reputation at the time as a haven for wanted criminals. The Barker–Karpis Gang&#x27;s most infamous crimes were committed after the move to St. Paul, during their residency in a string of rented houses. The gang operated under the protection of St. Paul&#x27;s police chief Thomas &quot;Big Tom&quot; Brown, and they went from being bank robbers to kidnappers under his guidance.

Ma&#x27;s common-law husband Arthur Dunlop was said to be loose-lipped when drunk, and he was not trusted by members of the gang; Karpis described him as a &quot;pain in the ass&quot;. While at one hideout, a resident identified the gang from photographs in &quot;True Detective&quot; magazine and told the police, but Chief Brown tipped them off and they escaped. The gang apparently believed that Dunlop&#x27;s loose lips had given them away, and they murdered him while traveling. His naked body was found near Webster, Wisconsin with a single bullet wound to the head. Chief Brown&#x27;s involvement in the gang&#x27;s escape could not be proven, but he was demoted to the rank of detective and was later dismissed from the police force altogether.

The gang relocated to Menomonie, Wisconsin, and Fred Barker hid Ma in a variety of hotels and hideouts during their stay there. The purpose was to keep her from learning much about the gang&#x27;s crimes, as well as to separate her from their girlfriends, with whom she did not get along. The FBI later claimed that she would try to break up any relationships, so that &quot;other women in the gang&quot; did their best to avoid her. By 1933, most of the gang were back in St. Paul where they carried out two kidnappings of wealthy businessmen. They obtained $100,000 in ransom by abducting William Hamm Jr., then arranged the kidnapping of Edward Bremer which netted them a $200,000 ransom. The FBI first connected the gang to the William Hamm kidnapping by using a new method of latent fingerprint identification. The gang decided to leave St. Paul with the FBI on the case and without Tom Brown supplying information; they moved to the Chicago area, renting apartments for Ma while they tried to launder the ransom.

==Death==

FBI agents discovered the hideout of Barker and her son Fred after Arthur was arrested in Chicago on January 8, 1935. A map found in his possession indicated that other gang members were in Ocklawaha, Florida. The FBI identified the house where the gang were staying from references to a local alligator known as &quot;Gator Joe&quot;, mentioned in a letter sent to Doc. The gang had rented the property as a vacation retreat under the pseudonym &quot;Blackburn&quot;.

Agents surrounded the house at 13250 East Highway C-25 on the morning of January 16, 1935. The FBI were not aware that Karpis and other gang members had left three days before, leaving only Fred and Ma in the house. The agents ordered them to surrender, but Fred opened fire; both he and his mother were killed by federal agents after an intense, hours-long shootout. Allegedly, many local people came to watch the events unfolding, even holding picnics during the gunfire. Gunfire from the house finally stopped, and the FBI ordered local estate handyman Willie Woodbury to enter the house wearing a bulletproof vest. Woodbury reported that there was no one inside alive.

Both bodies were found in the same front bedroom. Fred&#x27;s body was riddled with bullets, but Ma appeared to have died from a single bullet wound. According to the FBI&#x27;s account, a Tommy gun was found lying in her hands. Other sources say that it was lying between the bodies of Ma and Fred. Their bodies were put on public display, and then stored unclaimed until October 1, 1935, when relatives had them buried at Williams Timberhill Cemetery in Welch, Oklahoma, next to the body of Herman Barker.

==Controversy over her leadership of the Barker gang==
The popular image of Ma as the gang&#x27;s leader and its criminal mastermind is often portrayed in films such as &quot;Ma Barker&#x27;s Killer Brood&quot; (1960), &quot;Bloody Mama&quot; (1970), and &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (1996). However, this is widely regarded by historians as fictitious, and some have been skeptical that she participated in the shoot-out in which she died. Karpis has suggested that the story was encouraged by J. Edgar Hoover and his fledgling Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to justify his agents&#x27; killing an old woman. After her death, Hoover claimed that Ma Barker was &quot;the most vicious, dangerous, and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade&quot;. He also claimed that she enjoyed the lifestyle that was the fruit of her sons&#x27; crimes and supposedly had a string of lovers.

Ma Barker&#x27;s children were murderers and their Barker–Karpis gang committed a spree of robberies, kidnappings, and other crimes between 1931 and 1935, but there is no conclusive proof that Ma was their leader. She certainly knew of the gang&#x27;s activities and even helped them before and after they committed their crimes, and this made her an accessory, but there is no evidence that she was involved in planning them. Her role was in taking care of gang members, who often sent her to the movies while they committed crimes. According to Claire Bond Potter, &quot;Her age and apparent respectability permitted the gang to hide out &#x27;disguised&#x27; as a family. As &#x27;Mrs. Hunter&#x27; and &#x27;Mrs. Anderson&#x27;, she rented houses, paid bills, shopped, and did household errands.&quot; Alvin Karpis was probably the real leader of the gang, and he later said that Ma was just &quot;an old-fashioned homebody from the Ozarks … superstitious, gullible, simple, cantankerous and, well, generally law abiding&quot;. He concluded:The most ridiculous story in the annals of crime is that Ma Barker was the mastermind behind the Karpis–Barker gang. … She wasn&#x27;t a leader of criminals or even a criminal herself. There is not one police photograph of her or set of fingerprints taken while she was alive… she knew we were criminals but her participation in our careers was limited to one function: when we traveled together, we moved as a mother and her sons. What could look more innocent?This view of Ma Barker is corroborated by notorious bank robber Harvey Bailey, who knew the Barkers well. He observed in his autobiography that Ma Barker &quot;couldn&#x27;t plan breakfast&quot; let alone a criminal enterprise. Writer Tim Mahoney argues that the real force behind the gang was the corrupt St. Paul law-enforcement system, especially under Police Chief Tom Brown. Before they met him, the gang were nothing more than a &quot;bumbling band of hillbilly burglars&quot; who would have been captured or killed long before becoming nationally notorious. &quot;Had the Barker gang never come under Brown&#x27;s protection, Ma Barker might have died lonesome in the Ozarks, an impoverished obscure widow.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Film and television
* &quot;Ma Webster&quot;, played by Blanche Yurka in the 1940 film &quot;Queen of the Mob&quot; is based on Barker. Changes in the names and depiction of events were at the request of the FBI.
* The character of &quot;Ma Jarrett&quot; in the 1949 James Cagney film &quot;White Heat&quot; is thought to be based on Ma Barker.
*Ma was played by Jean Harvey in 2 episodes of the TV series &quot;Gang Busters&quot; (1952).
* In the 1957 docudrama &quot;Guns Don&#x27;t Argue&quot; Ma is portrayed by Jean Harvey.
* &quot;Ma Barker and Her Boys&quot;, an episode of the 1959 TV series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, pits Federal Agent Eliot Ness against the Barker clan, and depicts Ness as leading the assault on Ma Barker and her sons at their Florida hide-out. In this version, Lloyd, Fred and Doc are all present at the final shootout. Ma was played by Claire Trevor. In real life Ness worked for the Bureau of Prohibition, not the FBI, and he had nothing to do with the Barker/Karpis case. The FBI objected to the fact that Ness was depicted as the leader of the attack on the gang.
* The 1959 movie &quot;The FBI Story&quot;, starring Jimmy Stewart, portrayed a number of deaths of 1930s-era criminals, including Ma Barker. In the scene, she was shown firing at law officers before finally being shot. (She was portrayed by Jane Crowley, though the role was uncredited.)
* Lurene Tuttle portrayed Ma Barker in the low-budget feature film &quot;Ma Barker&#x27;s Killer Brood&quot; (1960). The film&#x27;s scrolling text refers to her as a &quot;sadistic ... master of crime&quot; and &quot;evil genius&quot;. It portrays her controlling a gang that includes John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson, and constantly outwitting their rival Machine Gun Kelly.
* Ma was played by Joan Blondell in an episode of the 1961 TV series &quot;The Witness&quot;, which took the form of a mock-trial of historical individuals before a &quot;committee&quot; of lawyers. Her son Lloyd and various accomplices appear as witnesses.
* In the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; series, one of the villains in series one was &quot;Ma Parker&quot; (played by Shelley Winters), a villainous mob boss who was based on Ma Barker. Ma Parker along with her three sons and one daughter almost managed to defeat the Dynamic Duo in the series.
* Barker&#x27;s story was also adapted in the low-budget film &quot;Bloody Mama&quot; (1970). The movie starred Shelley Winters as Ma Barker. In this film her criminality is the result of childhood sexual abuse by her family.
* &quot;The Ma Gantry Gang&quot;, featured in the first episode of the 1974 TV series &quot;The Manhunter&quot; was based on Barker and her sons. Ma Gantry was played by Ida Lupino.
* Eileen Heckart played Ma in the 1974 film &quot;The FBI Story: the FBI Versus Alvin Karpis, Public Enemy Number One&quot;.
* The &quot;DuckTales&quot; version of Disney&#x27;s Beagle Boys (the series lasted from 1987 to 1990), a gang of criminals, is led by their mother Ma Beagle, who is based on Ma Barker. She is absent from the original comics which were written by Carl Barks.
* In the 1978 film &quot;Stingray&quot;, Lieutenant Hershal stated to one of his colleagues that Abigail Britowski, played by Sherry Jackson, made Ma Barker look like a nun, in a reference to the notorious alleged criminal. 
*In the 1985 film &quot;The Goonies&quot; Mama Fratelli is loosely based on Ma Barker.
* Another retelling of the legend occurred in the 1996 movie &quot;Public Enemies&quot; starring Theresa Russell. As in &quot;Bloody Mama&quot;, she is depicted as a victim of sexual abuse which brutalizes her.
*In the 2007 film &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;
*In &quot;Ben 10&quot; Ma Vreedle is a recurrent antagonist, leader of a criminal gang with her children.

Literature
* Maw Famon and her thug sons who battle it out with Dick Tracy in a December 1935 comic strip are based on Ma Barker and her boys.
* While The Daltons of the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; comic book series were originally based on the real Dalton Gang, their mother, Ma Dalton, is clearly inspired by Ma Barker. Coincidentally, their gang consists of four instead of three Dalton brothers.
* Crime author James Hadley Chase based some of the characters in his first novel, &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; (1939), on Ma Barker and her sons.

Music
* John Eaton composed an opera, &quot;Ma Barker&quot;, in 1955, to a libretto by Arthur Gold.
* In 1977, disco band Boney M. released a hit single titled &quot;Ma Baker&quot; (Barker was changed into Baker because it sounded better), which was later covered by German Comedy Rock band Knorkator, and has since been covered by German heavy metal band Axxis, Milli Vanilli in 1988, and sampled by Lady Gaga in her single &quot;Poker Face&quot;. The song&#x27;s title and lyrics are clearly about Ma Barker. 
* The band Maylene and the Sons of Disaster (formed in 2004) are named after the group of criminals and their songs are based on the gang&#x27;s history. Band member Dallas Taylor has said: &quot;Maylene and the Sons of Disaster is made up of five dudes who play the role of the Barker sons, and in these songs we speak as though we were them, telling any who would listen that a life lived unjustly will meet divine justice on the other side. We also wanted to think of the most crazy backwoods theme possible for this band. Since Ma was backwoods, and we are backwoods, this is the way it had to be.&quot;
* The former wife of gangsta rap pioneer Kool G Rap is an MC who goes under the name of Ma Barker. They had at one point formed a group called 5 Family Click, releasing a collective album and surfacing on mixtapes.
* Composer Michel Wintsch and writer Gérald Chevrolet adapted the writings of Marguerite Yourcenar to create the opera &quot;Ma Barker&quot; in 1996.

Other
* The Lake Weir Chamber of Commerce stages an annual &quot;Ma Barker Shootout&quot; on &quot;Ma Barker Day&quot; in a building near the actual location of her death.
* The Barker death house in Ocklawaha, Florida, was listed for sale on August 16, 2012. The bidding began at one million dollars and included the original furnishings, but the house ultimately went unsold. In 2015, the Florida state senate proposed a bill for $500,000 to repair and preserve the house as an historic landmark, but the bill was rejected. The house was subsequently taken off the market.
* In October 2016, the Barker death house was relocated via barge across Lake Weir to Carney Island in Marion County in preparation for being opened to the public as a museum in late 2017 or 2018. The land where it had sat since 1930 was sold by its owners. Just prior to the relocation of the house, a vintage ring which bears the initials, &quot;F.B&quot; was found when a team using metal detectors gained permission to scan the location. The ring is presumed to have been owned by Fred Barker and it has been added to the collection along with several bullet casings and assorted paraphernalia.

<text>Go Tell It on the Mountain is a 1953 semi-autobiographical novel by James Baldwin. It tells the story of John Grimes, an intelligent teenager in 1930s Harlem, and his relationship with his family and his church. The novel also reveals the back stories of John&#x27;s mother, his biological father, and his violent, fanatically religious stepfather, Gabriel Grimes. The novel focuses on the role of the Pentecostal Church in the lives of African Americans, both as a negative source of repression and moral hypocrisy and a positive source of inspiration and community.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; 39th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels released from 1923 to 2005.

==Background==
James Baldwin was born in 1924 in Harlem to an unwed mother who had left Maryland for New York and never knew his biological father. Several years later, his mother married a much older laborer and Baptist preacher from Louisiana who had come north in 1919. James Baldwin took his step-father&#x27;s surname and was raised as his son along with his many half-siblings. He later described his stepfather as &quot;Brooding, silent, tyrannical ... and physically abusive, he was also a storefront preacher of morbid intensity.&quot; During his high school years, uncomfortable with the fact that, unlike many of his peers, he was becoming more sexually interested in men than in women, Baldwin sought refuge in religion. At the age of 14, he began preaching himself and continued to do so for several years.

&quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; was Baldwin&#x27;s first published novel and it draws significantly on his personal experience and the experiences of those around him during his childhood in Harlem, particularly those who came to Harlem as part of the Great Migration from the South. It was the result of work that began in at least 1938. Baldwin showed an early manuscript to novelist Richard Wright in 1944. Wright helped Baldwin secure an advance from Harper &amp; Brothers but the deal did not result in publication.

In February 1952, Baldwin sent a later version of the manuscript from Paris, France, where he was living at the time, to New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. They expressed interest, and Baldwin returned to New York to meet with Knopf. He agreed to rewrite parts of &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot; in exchange for a $250 advance ($ today) and a further $750 ($ today) paid when the final manuscript was completed. After the final draft was accepted, Baldwin published excerpts of the novel in two publications: one excerpt was published as &quot;Exodus&quot; in &quot;American Mercury&quot; and the other as &quot;Roy&#x27;s Wound&quot; in &quot;New World Writing&quot;. Baldwin set sail back to Europe on August 28 and &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot; was published in May 1953.

==Structure and synopsis==
&quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; has a nonlinear structure. The story takes place during one 24-hour period, but contains extended flashbacks which cover a period of more than 70 years. The novel is focused on John Grimes, but narrative voice shifts between characters&#x27; perspectives, allowing access to the thoughts and reminiscences of John&#x27;s father, mother, and aunt. The novel is divided into three parts : &quot;Part One: The Seventh Day&quot;, &quot;Part Two: The Prayer of the Saints&quot; (divided into parts for Florence, Gabriel, and Elizabeth), and &quot;Part Three: The Threshing-Floor&quot;. The first and final parts mainly follow John&#x27;s thoughts with glimpses of the thoughts of others, while the sections in Part Two mainly follow the thoughts of the character for whom they are named.

===Part One===
In Part One, John wakes up on his birthday. He sits down for breakfast, expecting something special from his mother. However, he is met with the regular breakfast that is served regularly in the household. His mother then sends him off to do his daily chores like any other day. As he does his chores, he thinks about his relationship with his domineering father, who does not seem to love him, and seems to have much hatred towards John. He also begins to think about his relationship with the storefront church at which his father is a sometimes preacher. The church is a major part in the life of John’s family. His family is extremely religious and spends a lot of their time at and supporting the church. All of the members of the Grimes family are very intertwined within the church. His younger half-brother Roy also resents his father&#x27;s strictness, but unlike John has begun to rebel by running with a rough crowd. The rebellion against his father leaves a lot of anger within Gabriel and builds upon the constant thought of their father not loving them. Once John has finished his chores, his mother Elizabeth gives him some money for his birthday, and he goes out. He walks through Central Park and down Fifth Avenue, before going into a movie theater to watch a film.

John returns home to find that Roy has gone with some neighborhood boys to pick a fight and has been cut with a knife. John&#x27;s stepfather Gabriel returns home. Gabriel is angry. He lashes out and looks for someone to blame besides Roy. Gabriel ultimately ends up putting the blame onto Elizabeth and Gabriel’s own sister, Florence, who was in the house with the family at the time. Gabriel&#x27;s sister Florence and Elizabeth object that no one is to blame but Roy since he went out to pick the fight. Gabriel strikes Elizabeth causing Roy to challenge and curse him. Gabriel takes immense disrespect from Roy and will not settle for it. He decides that as his father, he must do something to Roy because he believes Roy is in no place to challenge Gabriel and question his authority over him. Gabriel whips Roy with a belt until Florence intervenes. Gabriel does not appreciate Florence intervening and talks down to her. John then goes to the church to do chores before evening services. Elisha, an older boy in the church arrives to help and the two exchange playful barbs and then playfully wrestle. The two then finish cleaning the church while talking about John&#x27;s soul and salvation. Two women arrive followed shortly by John&#x27;s father, mother, and aunt Florence.

===Part Two===
====Florence&#x27;s Prayer====
Florence recalls her childhood with Gabriel and their mother, a former slave. She recalls her devout mother leading them in prayer after the rape of a girl, Deborah, by a group of white men. She resented that just because Gabriel was a boy, her mother always put his future ahead of hers even though she was much better behaved. Florence eventually left home despite her mother&#x27;s illness to go north to New York where she met Frank, whom she married. The marriage was not happy as Frank drank and was irresponsible with money, both buying her extravagant gifts and spending on binges. He eventually left her for another woman and died in France in World War I.

====Gabriel&#x27;s Prayer====
Gabriel also recalls his wild youth, which ended after Florence left when he was saved at the age of 22. He stopped drinking and debauching and became a preacher. Deborah, whom no one would marry because she had been raped, supports him and helps him after his mother dies and Gabriel asks her to marry him. Back in the church, Gabriel hears a cry of praise and worries that John is being visited by the Holy Spirit. He resents that his two natural sons have not been saved and worries that John, who is not his biological son, will be saved. These thoughts lead him to his affair with a woman named Esther, who subsequently became pregnant and died giving birth to his son, Royal. Royal was raised by Esther&#x27;s mother and Gabriel never acknowledged him and worried that Deborah would learn the truth. Later, during a period of racial tensions after a black soldier has been lynched, Gabriel encountered Royal walking home and warned him to be careful. Later, Deborah tells Gabriel that Royal left for Chicago where he was killed in a knife fight. Deborah confronts Gabriel, who admits that Royal was his son and Deborah tells him he should pray for forgiveness. Seeing John, Gabriel recalls that he had believed that meeting and marrying Elizabeth was a sign that God had forgiven him.

====Elizabeth&#x27;s Prayer====
Elizabeth recalls how after the death of her distant mother, her aunt took her away from her father, whom she loved, because he ran a brothel. Elizabeth resented her and she was never loving. Later Elizabeth fell in love with a store clerk, Richard. The two ran away to New York together. Although they were not married, Elizabeth became pregnant but did not tell Richard right away. Before she told him, he was wrongfully arrested for theft. He refused to confess and was brutally beaten by the police. After he was eventually acquitted and returned home, she decided not to tell him she was pregnant that night, but by morning he had killed himself. After thinking of Richard, she looks at John and wonders if she did the right thing to keep him rather than give him for adoption, and to marry Gabriel who has never loved John. She recalls how she met Florence at her job as a cleaning woman and Florence introduced her to her brother Gabriel, now a widower who recently came north. Although Florence discourages the romance, Elizabeth respects Gabriel&#x27;s religiosity and believes Gabriel will offer protection and stability for herself and John and agrees to marry him. Her thoughts return to the present and she sees John lying on the floor of the church overcome by a religious vision.

===Part Three===
John experiences a series of hallucinatory religious visions in which he confronts many of his sins, hopes, and doubts. He sees his father&#x27;s face and recalls that he has seen his father naked and compares himself to the story of Ham who saw his father Noah naked and was forever cursed – a story that was long used to justify slavery and oppression of black people. After further visions, John sees a glimpse of God and feels himself saved. He returns to consciousness and realizes that it is morning and he has been there all night. All are happy for him except Gabriel who seems unconvinced. The group leaves the church to walk home and Florence, who is terminally ill, confronts Gabriel with a letter from Deborah which reveals her suspicions that Gabriel had fathered a son with Esther. Florence accuses Gabriel of making John and Elizabeth suffer to expiate his own guilt for his sin with Esther and Royal and promises to reveal the truth to Elizabeth. Meanwhile, John speaks with Elisha who congratulates and encourages him until they reach John&#x27;s home.

==Setting==
The novel takes place in New York City, primarily in Harlem in 1935. The flashbacks provide extended sequences in the American South, primarily in an unnamed town in the Deep South where Gabriel and Florence were born, and in Maryland where Elizabeth was raised. The flashbacks also recall earlier periods in Harlem and to a lesser extent other locations in New York.

In the novel, New York City at once represents freedom and opportunity – especially for Florence and Elizabeth, who escape confining family lives, and for John, who contemplates the opportunities of the world outside Harlem as he walks through Midtown Manhattan – but also the vulgarity and perdition, particularly for Gabriel and through Gabriel, for John. This duality is used to enhance the other conflicts in the novel, particularly between holiness and worldliness and between John and Gabriel. For Elizabeth especially, but also for Florence and Gabriel, the promise of the city, the promise that drove the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to Northern cities including New York, turned out to be false. Elizabeth reflects that unlike the South, which promises nothing, the North promises but does not give and what is given can be taken away in an instant. Although the Great Migration led to the Harlem Renaissance and a flourishing of art and culture, the novel&#x27;s depiction of Harlem is focused on the poverty, violence, drunkenness, and sexual depravity which were also a result.

==Themes==

===Religion===
The religious theme pervades all aspects of the novel. However, critics have not agreed on whether it is &quot;an ironic indictment of Christianity&quot; or a &quot;stirring vindication&quot;. Barbara Olson summarized the dispute noting that &quot;those favoring vindication number in their ranks such notable critics as Albert Gerard, Donald Gibson, and Shirley Allen&quot; while &quot;those favoring the indictment position include Robert Bone, Michel Fabre, Nathan Scott, Howard Harper, Stanley Macebuh, David Foster and Trudier Harris.&quot;

====Holiness versus worldliness====
Many scholars have reflected on the tension between holiness and worldliness in the novel. The strict Pentecostal religion of the Temple of the Fire Baptized, enforced by John&#x27;s father, demands that believers live separately from much of the world around them. Much of Part One is taken up with John&#x27;s thoughts on how he fits in or fails to fit in both with the &quot;holy&quot; people of his father&#x27;s church and also with the &quot;worldly&quot; people he knows from the neighborhood and school. Charles Scruggs writes that the novel juxtaposes &quot;the earthly and the heavenly, and together they help focus the novel&#x27;s various themes.&quot;

====Religious allusion====
The novel is rich with biblical and religious allusions and references. The title of the novel is taken from a spiritual of the same name and &quot;each of the three parts has a title and two epigraphs referring to the Bible or Christian hymns, and each of the prayers in Part Two begins with a quotation from a hymn.&quot; The title of Part One &quot;The Seventh Day&quot; is a clear reference to the biblical sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested after he created the heavens and the earth. Allen argues this is both the day John is done being &quot;created&quot;, i.e. when he comes into his own, but God also made the Sabbath holy, and it is the day John will become holy. Similarly, Part Three &quot;The Threshing-Floor&quot; is an allusion to Matthew 3:12, in which John the Baptist states that on the threshing floor Jesus will separate the wheat (saved) from the chaff (unsaved).

Baldwin includes excerpts from many spirituals throughout the novel but especially as John is undergoing his religious vision and the &quot;saints&quot; of the church sing around him, each of which highlights a particular aspect of the narrative. In addition, many of the characters&#x27; names refer directly to biblical characters. Critics have compared John both to John the Baptist and John of Patmos who experienced a religious vision in the Book of Revelation. John the Baptist&#x27;s mother Elizabeth, the archangel Gabriel, the prophetess Deborah, and the Jewish Queen Esther also provide names of significant characters.

Baldwin frequently makes use of direct references including the story of Ham, the story of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt, and the story of Lot&#x27;s wife who looked backward and was turned into a pillar of salt. Other passages, such John&#x27;s wrestling with Elisha evoke biblical referents, like the story of Jacob wrestling with a mysterious supernatural being in Genesis.

====Language====
The rhythm and language of the story draw heavily on the language of the Bible, particularly of the King James Version. Many of the passages use the patterns of repetition identified by scholars such as Robert Alter and others as being characteristic of Biblical poetry. In addition, much of the characters&#x27; speech is laced with biblical quotations and references, which both provides a note of verisimilitude in the dialogue but also a layer of religious symbolism.

===Race===
Most critics and scholars have agreed that while race is not the core of the book, it remains an important theme. Shirley Allen wrote, &quot;obviously Baldwin weaves the black-versus-white theme into the central conflict as inextricably as it is woven into the daily consciousness of the characters; but the major conflict of this novel ... is not black against white, but the more universal problem of youth achieving maturity.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Orville Prescott said in his contemporary assessment that, although the novel is not primarily about race, &quot;Mr. Baldwin is as bitter about race discrimination in a few passing references as many authors are in whole books.&quot;

Race comes to the fore for each character in different ways. John questions his father&#x27;s visceral animosity towards white people, while at the same time feeling acutely aware of his blackness as he leaves Harlem and walks through other parts of the city. Already feeling alienated from the secular culture of Harlem (which has sucked in Roy, who at the same time has gone to pick a fight with white boys in another neighborhood), and from the religious culture represented by his father (&quot;His father said that all white people were wicked, and the God was going to bring them low&quot;). Without ever being quite comfortable, he wonders about the promise of other opportunities in these white-dominated spaces, such as the New York Public Library, which he does not enter (but not, he tells himself, because he is black) and the movie theater, which he finds, despite his momentary trepidation, admits him without comment on his race.

Deborah&#x27;s rape as an adolescent at the hands of a group of white men, and later a brutal lynching and castration of a black soldier highlight the violence of racism in the South for both Florence and Gabriel. It is noteworthy that Florence&#x27;s prayer features a rape, reinforcing the status of black women, already highlighted by their mother&#x27;s favoritism toward Gabriel as the son. Gabriel&#x27;s prayer features castration, just as he encounters his unacknowledged son and feels acutely his inability to protect him from danger and his biological son&#x27;s estrangement from him. Elizabeth&#x27;s prayer reinforces that African Americans have not escaped racism by coming north; the brutal treatment of Richard at the hands of the police and the justice system causes his suicide.

===Sexuality===
Sex and sexuality are important throughout the novel, particularly for John and Gabriel. The novel engages with traditional religious views of sexuality as something sinful that is to be avoided. The church&#x27;s stigmas surrounding sexuality impressed on him by his father, have severely impacted John&#x27;s perspective on sexuality. Several critics have viewed John&#x27;s religious rebirth in terms of him coming to terms with his sexuality, both as a gay man and as a black man.

Critics have noted the &quot;constant repetition of such phrases as &#x27;the natural man&#x27; and &#x27;the old Adam in condemnation of man&#x27;s sexual desire. This conflict is central for John, who at the start of the novel is reflecting on his own &quot;sin&quot; (masturbation) and his burgeoning sexuality. Many scholars read John&#x27;s conversion as a rejection of his father&#x27;s strict sexual mores. Angelo Robinson argues that because the novel &quot;alters the traditional Pentecostal conversion experience in that John is not &#x27;cured,&#x27; &#x27;healed,&#x27; or &#x27;delivered&#x27; from his sexual desire during his rebirth&quot; but is restored&#x27; to confront the reality of his sexual desires while at the same time claiming the promise of salvation&quot; and is ultimately &quot;freed from Gabriel&#x27;s faith with its severe sexual ethic&quot;. Furthermore, Baldwin often used sexual language and imagery in describing religious zeal. This is particularly noticeable when Elisha is called before the congregation to be chastised for his nascent relationship with a girl, Ella Mae, he is described with his &quot;head thrown back, eyes closed, sweat standing on his brow&quot;, &quot;stiffened and trembles&quot;, &quot;cried out Jesus, Jesus, oh Lord Jesus!&quot;, &quot;face congested&quot;, and &quot;his body could not contain this passion&quot;.

John&#x27;s homosexuality is also at issue in the novel, though John himself spends less time concerned directly with the &quot;kind&quot; of his sexual desire than he does with its existence at all. Nevertheless, given the autobiographical details in the novel, scholars have interrogated how John&#x27;s experience reflects Baldwin&#x27;s search for an identity as a gay man and perhaps his reflections on his own homosexuality after many years of being out. Because the issue is not addressed directly, scholars have evaluated John&#x27;s homosexuality through the lens of other themes in the book. &quot;John&#x27;s struggles with his homosexuality provide the window through which to understand the complexity of his struggles with his spirituality.&quot; John&#x27;s conversation with Elisha and Elisha&#x27;s kiss led Stanley Macebuh to argue that John&#x27;s salvation is through homosexual love though others have argued that goes too far. Yet Mason Stokes perhaps goes even further, arguing that both John&#x27;s struggle against his father and his religious conversion reflect his struggle against &quot;a heterosexuality that terrorizes&quot; him, which is reflected in the conflict between Gabriel&#x27;s obsession with descendants and his strict religious sexual code. The novel&#x27;s depictions of heterosexuality (rape, prostitution, adultery, loveless marriages) is contrasted with John&#x27;s love for Elisha, which &quot;somehow purer, more loving, than the novel&#x27;s often perverse heterosexual expressions&quot;.

Other critics have examined the ties between race and sexuality in the novel. Andrew Connolly draws a connection between Gabriel&#x27;s guilt over his sexuality and the &quot;persistent racial stereotypes surrounding black male sexuality and the thread of violence that accompanies those stereotypes&quot; and argues that John&#x27;s conversion represents &quot;the unrealized potential that black men can resist systemic pressures and embrace their sexuality without confirming racist stereotypes.&quot; This connection is highlighted as Gabriel recalls the body of a black soldier who has been castrated and lynched.

===Family===
John&#x27;s religious struggle is also parallel to his struggle with his father. At the end of the novel, in his moment of &quot;salvation&quot;, John is knocked to the ground by the Holy Ghost. He then hears a voice that says, &quot;Get up, John, Get up boy. Don&#x27;t let him keep you there. You got everything your Daddy got&quot;. In this way, his religious revelation, while representing an acceptance of his father&#x27;s religion, also reflects his rejection of his father&#x27;s authority and the burgeoning of his own individuality, rather than merely accepting the role his father has created for him within the family.

Other relationships throughout the novel also cast light on the notion of family including Gabriel&#x27;s emotionally and physically sterile marriage to Deborah, Elizabeth&#x27;s adoption by her aunt and abandonment by her father, Florence&#x27;s resentment toward her mother, Gabriel&#x27;s lack of relationship with his biological son Royal, Elizabeth&#x27;s relationship with John&#x27;s biological father Richard, Florence&#x27;s marriage to the unreliable Frank, and Florence and Gabriel&#x27;s mother&#x27;s reflections on her lovers and children while still a slave.

===Guilt===
An early reviewer noted that &quot;Guilt, guilt, guilt chimes through the book. Gabriel is guilty. His first wife Deborah is guilty though she was the victim of rape. His second wife Elizabeth is guilty, though she loved much. Guilt is visited on his children.&quot; The novel opens with John feeling guilty about his masturbation and sexual desires. This is mirrored in the young Gabriel&#x27;s guilt over his own sexual transgressions which ultimately lead to his conversion. However, Gabriel&#x27;s guilt over his later inability to live up to his own conversion ideals haunts him and is ultimately the cause of his conflict with John: &quot;John becomes a focal point for [Gabriel&#x27;s] sense of guilt, encapsulating all the other people who make Gabriel feel guilty&quot; such as Deborah, Esther, Royal, Roy, and Elizabeth; &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s hatred of John is rooted in his guilt over and his denial of his failures as a father.&quot; Meanwhile, Elizabeth accepts Gabriel&#x27;s abuse and tyranny partly as a form of divine punishment on both her and John for her guilt, guilt both for not repenting her love for Richard and for her failure to save him from his suicide.

===Women===
Though the novel is primarily focused on John and his conflict with Gabriel, female characters play an important role in the novel and explore women&#x27;s role in society. Florence&#x27;s prayer in particular articulates a nascent feminism. Although Florence is five years older than her brother Gabriel, he was given the education and respect that Florence desired. Although raised by a single mother, the patriarchal environment meant that Gabriel&#x27;s future matters more than Florence&#x27;s. Mason Stokes notes that Florence rejects &quot;the regulatory regimes of the heteropatriarchal household&quot;; not only does she reject the men who lusted after her beauty &quot;not wishing to exchange her mother&#x27;s cabin for theirs and to raise their children&quot;, her final act is to undermine Gabriel&#x27;s authority by promising to reveal his prior infidelity and abandonment of his son Royal to Elizabeth and the church community.

==Adaptations==
The Public Broadcasting Service produced a made-for-television movie based on &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; in 1984. Stan Lathan directed the film, with Paul Winfield starring as Gabriel in his adulthood and Ving Rhames playing Gabriel in his youth. Baldwin was pleased with the adaptation, saying in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I am very, very happy about it ... It did not betray the book.&quot;

The novel has been translated into numerous languages, including Swedish, French, Japanese, Finnish, German, Italian, Polish, Norwegian, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Czech, Arabic, and Dutch.

==Reception==
&quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; was widely praised at its publication and since. It received favorable reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Virginia Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;The Hudson Review&quot;, and &quot;Phylon&quot;, among others.

Writing a decade later, Wallace Graves noted in a highly critical essay, that &quot;when the book was reviewed in the summer of 1953, critics were most generous in praise, and except for Anthony West in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ... Baldwin was welcomed almost carte blanche as a brilliant young novelist of great promise.&quot;

It is generally regarded as Baldwin&#x27;s best novel and as one of the great African American novels of the 20th Century. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; 39th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels released from 1923 to 2005. Publisher Franklin Library included it in its &quot;100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature&quot; collection published from 1976-1984 for the American Bicentennial.

The novel is regularly assigned as part of curricula in high schools and colleges. However, its assignment has also aroused controversy. In 1988, a teacher in Prince William County, Virginia, offered the book as a ninth-grade summer reading option. Parents challenged the book because it is &quot;rife with profanity and explicit sex&quot;. In 1994, the book was challenged in Hudson Falls, New York, after a teacher had assigned the book as required reading. Parents challenged the book because of &quot;recurring themes of rape, masturbation, violence, and degrading treatment of women&quot;.

<doc id="839310" wikidata="Q56376804" url="?curid=839310" title="Hinduism in the Middle East">
<text>Hinduism has been present in the form of ancient Hinduism or Vedic religion in other parts of the Middle East and influenced the Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in ancient Persia. Krishna, one of the avatars of Vishnu and prominent Hindu deity, figures prominently in some of religions in the region.

While influencing ancient religions of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, the Hindu notion of reincarnation or transmigration of souls was incorporated in other smaller religions such as Yazidism as well as Druze. Many religions in the Middle East, notable among them is Yazidism, draw heavily from common Indo-Iranian traditions, closely connected to Hinduism. The Yarsani, followers of Yarsanism, believe that the Divine Essence has successive incarnations known as &quot;mazhariyyats&quot; (similar to the Hindu notion of avatars). 

At present, there is an influential and wealthy Hindu community, mostly of Indian, Nepalese and Sri Lankan heritage in Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Many came due to the migration of Indians and Nepalese expatriates and employees to the area around the Persian Gulf. 
Hindu temples have been built in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Oman.

==Demographics==


==Historical background==
Indian settlers came to live in Oman, creating settlements and practicing Hinduism. Arab sailors were using the southwest monsoon winds to trade with western Indian ports before the first century CE. An Arab army conquered Sindh in 711 and Arab traders settled in Kerala in the 6th century. In the opposite direction, medieval Gujaratis, Kutchis, and other Indians traded extensively with Arab and Somali ports, including Hormuz, Salalah, Socotra, Mogadishu, Merca, Barawa, Hobyo, Muscat and Aden. Arab merchants were the dominant carriers of Indian Ocean trade until the Portuguese forcibly supplanted them at the end of the 15th century. Indo-Arabian links were renewed under the British Empire, when many Indians serving in the army or civil service were stationed in Arab lands such as Sudan. The current wave of Indian immigration to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf dates roughly to the 1960s. Hinduism is also one of the fastest growing religions in the Middle East, mainly due to immigration from the Indian Subcontinent.

In 2001, Belgian speleologists discovered a large number of inscriptions, drawings, and archaeological objects on the Socotra island in Yemen left by sailors who visited the island from the 1st century BC to 6th century AD. Most of the texts found were written in the Indian Brahmi script.

==Egypt==
There were about 2,700 Hindus in Egypt in 2010. That number decreased to about 1535 in 2020. There are no known Hindu temples in Egypt.

==Oman==
Oman has an immigrant Hindu minority. The number of Hindus has declined in the 20th century although it is now stable. Hinduism first came to Muscat in 1507 from Kutch. The original Hindus spoke Kutchi. By the early 19th century there were at least 4,000 Hindus in Oman, all of the intermediate merchant caste. By 1900, their numbers had plummeted to 300. In 1895, the Hindu colony in Muscat came under attack by the Ibadhis. By the time of independence, only a few dozen Hindus remained in Oman. The historical Hindu Quarters of al-Waljat and al-Banyan are no longer occupied by Hindus. The most prominent immigrant Hindus, are Visoomal Damodar Gandhi (Aulad Kara), Khimji Ramdas, Dhanji Morarji, Ratansi Purushottam and Purushottam Toprani. The only Hindu crematorium is located in Sohar, northwest of Muscat.

===Temples===
Hindu temples once located in Ma&#x27;bad al Banyan and Bayt al Pir no longer exist after the area&#x27;s redevelopment in the mid-1970s. The only active Hindu temples today are the Shiva temple complex in Muscat (locally known as Motishwar Mandir), and the Krishna temple located in Darsait.

==Qatar==
Hindus make up 15.9% of Qatar. There are an estimated 422,118 Hindus in the country. Many Hindus are from South and Southeast Asia.

==Saudi Arabia==

Saudi authorities interpret Hindu icons as idols, and idol worship is strongly condemned in Sunni Islam. This is likely the foundation for the stringent position of Saudi authorities when it comes to idol-worshipping religious practice.

==United Arab Emirates==

South Asians in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) constitute the largest ethnic group in the country. Over 2 million Indian migrants (mostly from the southern Indian states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Coastal Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) are estimated to be living in the UAE, constituting 28% of the total population of the Emirates as of 2017. A majority of Indians live in the three largest cities of the UAE — Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. From the estimated 2 million migrants, 1 million are from Kerala and 450,000 from Tamil Nadu, thus constituting a majority of the Indian community in the UAE. The population of Indian migrants in the UAE had grown from 170,000 in 1975 to an estimated value of 750,000 in 1999. By 2009, this value had grown to an estimated value of 2 million. A majority of Indians in the UAE (approximately 50%—883,313 in 2011) are from the South Indian state of Kerala, followed by migrants from Tamil Nadu. The majority of Indian migrants to UAE are Muslim (50%), followed by Christian (25%) and Hindu (25%). Estimated Hindu population in UAE is between 6-10%.

===Temples===
In 1958, permission were given to build the Hindu Temple, Dubai in Bur Dubai in a complex that included Shiva Mandir, Krishna Mandir, and Gurudwara. In January 2024, a new Hindu Temple, Dubai opened in Jebel Ali and the existing Shiva Mandir and Gurudwara were moved to this new location. Krishan Mandir is still housed in the original complex in Bur Dubai.

Majority of Hindus living in UAE practice their religion within their homes. The new temple, BAPS Hindu Mandir Abu Dhabi, had its foundation stone laying ceremony in April, 2019. The inauguration ceremony of the temple took place on 14 February 2024.

==Yemen==

There are about 200,000 Hindus in Yemen. Many of them are from India and Nepal.

==Hindu temples==
*BAPS Hindu Mandir Abu Dhabi, UAE
* Sindhi Guru Darbar Temple in Dubai, UAE 
*Motishwar Mandir in Muscat, Oman
*Hindu Temple, Dubai, UAE
*Shrinathji Temple, Bahrain

<doc id="839321" wikidata="Q854506" url="?curid=839321" title="Line level">
<text>Line level is the specified strength of an audio signal used to transmit analog sound between audio components such as CD and DVD players, television sets, audio amplifiers, and mixing consoles.

Generally, line level signals sit in the middle of the hierarchy of signal levels in audio engineering. There are weaker signals such as those from microphones (Mic Level/Microphone Level) and instrument pickups (Instrument Level), and stronger signals, such as those used to drive headphones and loudspeakers (Speaker Level). The &quot;strength&quot; of these various signals does not necessarily refer to the output voltage of the source device; it also depends on its output impedance and output power capability.

Consumer electronic devices concerned with audio (for example sound cards) often have a connector labeled &quot;line in&quot; and/or &quot;line out&quot;. &quot;Line out&quot; provides an audio signal output and &quot;line in&quot; receives a signal input. The line in/out connections on consumer-oriented audio equipment are typically unbalanced, with a (0.14 inch, but commonly called &quot;eighth inch&quot;) 3-conductor TRS minijack connector providing ground, left channel, and right channel, or stereo RCA jacks. Professional equipment commonly uses balanced connections on (1/4 inch) TRS phone jacks or XLR connectors. Professional equipment may also use unbalanced connections with (1/4 inch) TS phone jacks.

== Nominal levels ==
A line level describes a line&#x27;s nominal signal level as a ratio, expressed in decibels, against a standard reference voltage. The nominal level and the reference voltage against which it is expressed depend on the line level being used. While the nominal levels themselves vary, only two reference voltages are common: for consumer applications, and for professional applications.

The decibel volt reference voltage is . The decibel unloaded reference voltage, , is the AC voltage required to produce of power across a impedance (approximately ). This awkward unit is a holdover from the early telephone standards, which used 600 Ω sources and loads, and measured dissipated power in decibel-milliwatts (dBm). Modern audio equipment does not use 600 Ω matched loads, hence &quot;dBm unloaded&quot; (&quot;dBu&quot;).

The most common nominal level for professional equipment is (by convention, decibel values are written with an explicit sign symbol). For consumer equipment it is , which is used to reduce manufacturing costs.

Expressed in absolute terms, a signal at is equivalent to a sine wave signal with a peak amplitude (VPK) of approximately , or any general signal at root mean square (VRMS). A signal at is equivalent to a sine wave signal with a peak amplitude of approximately , or any general signal at approximately 1.228 VRMS.

Peak-to-peak (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;p-p&quot;) amplitude (VPP) refers to the total voltage swing of a signal, which is double the peak amplitude of the signal. For instance, a signal with a peak amplitude of has a of .

The line level signal is an alternating current signal without a DC offset, meaning that its voltage varies with respect to signal ground from the peak amplitude (for example ) to the equivalent negative voltage ().

== Impedances ==

As cables between line output and line input are generally extremely short compared to the audio signal wavelength in the cable, 
transmission line effects can be disregarded and impedance matching need not be used. 
Instead, line level circuits use the impedance bridging principle, 
in which a low impedance output drives a high impedance input. 
A typical line out connection has an output impedance from 100 to 600 Ω, with lower values being more common in newer equipment. 
Line inputs present a much higher impedance, typically or more.

The two impedances form a voltage divider with a shunt element that is large relative to the size of the series element, which ensures that little of the signal is shunted to ground and that current requirements are minimized. 
Most of the voltage asserted by the output appears across the input impedance and almost none of the voltage is dropped across the output.
The line input acts similarly to a high impedance voltmeter or oscilloscope input, measuring the voltage asserted by the output while drawing minimal current (and hence minimal power) from the source. 
The high impedance of the line in circuit does not load down the output of the source device.

These are voltage signals (as opposed to current signals) and it is the signal information (voltage) that is desired, not power to drive a transducer, such as a speaker or antenna. The actual information that is exchanged between the devices is the variance in voltage; it is this alternating voltage signal that conveys the information, making the current irrelevant.

== Line out ==
             Line-out symbol. PC Guide color lime green.

Line outputs usually present a source impedance of from 100 to 600 ohms. The voltage can reach 2 volts peak-to-peak with levels referenced to −10 dBV (300 mV) at . The frequency response of most modern equipment is advertised as at least 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which corresponds to the range of human hearing. Line outputs are intended to drive a load impedance of 
10,000 ohms; with only a few volts, this requires only minimal current.

=== Connecting other devices ===

Connecting a low-impedance load such as a loudspeaker (usually ) to a line out will essentially short circuit the output circuit. Such loads are around 1/1000 the impedance a line out is designed to drive, so the line out is usually not designed to source the current that would be drawn by a 4 to 8 ohm load at normal line out signal voltages. The result will be very weak sound from the speaker and possibly a damaged line out circuit.

Headphone outputs and line outputs are sometimes confused. 
Different make and model headphones have widely varying impedances, from as little as to a few hundred ohms; the lowest of these will have results similar to a speaker, while the highest may work acceptably if the line out impedance is low enough and the headphones are sensitive enough.

Conversely, a headphone output generally has a source impedance of only a few ohms (to provide a bridging connection with 32 ohm headphones) and will easily drive a line input.

For similar reasons, &quot;wye&quot;-cables (or &quot;Y-splitters&quot;) should not be used to combine two line out signals into a single line in. 
Each line output would be driving the other line output as well as the intended input, 
again resulting in a much heavier load than designed for. This will result in signal loss and possibly even damage.
An active mixer, using for example op-amps, 
should be used instead. A large resistor in series with each output can be used to safely mix them together, but must be appropriately designed for the load impedance and cable length.

== Line in ==
             Line-in symbol. PC Guide color light blue.

It is intended by designers that the line out of one device be connected to the line input of another. Line inputs are designed to accept voltage levels in the range provided by line outputs. 
Impedances, on the other hand, are deliberately not matched from output to input. 
The impedance of a line input is typically around . 
When driven by a line output&#x27;s usual low impedance of 100 to 600 ohms, this forms a &quot;bridging&quot; connection in which most of the voltage generated by the source (the output) is dropped across the load (the input), and minimal current flows due to the load&#x27;s relatively high impedance.

Although line inputs have a high impedance compared to that of line outputs, 
they should not be confused with so-called &quot;Hi-Z&quot; inputs (Z being the symbol for impedance) which have an impedance of to over . These &quot;Hi-Z&quot; or &quot;instrument&quot; inputs generally have higher gain than a line input.
They are designed to be used with, for example, electric guitar pickups and &quot;direct injection&quot; boxes. 
Some of these sources can provide only minimal voltage and current and the high impedance input is designed to not load them excessively.

== Line level in traditional signal paths ==
Acoustic sounds (such as voices or musical instruments) are often recorded with transducers (microphones and pickups) that produce weak electrical signals. These signals must be amplified to line level, where they are more easily manipulated by other devices such as mixing consoles and tape recorders. Such amplification is performed by a device known as a preamplifier or &quot;preamp&quot;, 
which boosts the signal to line level. 
After manipulation at line level, signals are then typically sent to a power amplifier, where they are amplified to levels that can drive headphones or loudspeakers. These convert the signals back into sounds that can be heard through the air.

Most phonograph cartridges also have a low output level and require a preamp; typically, a home stereo integrated amplifier or receiver will have a special phono input. This input passes the signal through a phono preamp, which applies RIAA equalization to the signal as well as boosting it to line level.

<doc id="839332" wikidata="Q1364261" url="?curid=839332" title="Iori Yagami">
<text>is a character from SNK&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; video game series. The character first appeared in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; as the leader of the Rivals Team, as the initial enemy and later rival of Kyo Kusanagi. Iori is the heir of the Yagami clan, who use pyrokinetic powers and sealed the Orochi devil along with the Kusanagi and Yata clans. Iori suffers from a curse –  – under which he becomes faster, stronger and wilder, exhibiting a deadly tendency to indiscriminately attack everyone in close proximity. In this state, Iori is commonly called &quot;Wild Iori&quot; or . Aside from the main series, Iori appears in several other media series, including spin-offs, crossover video games and comic adaptations of the series.

Iori was created as Kyo&#x27;s rival; his name and abilities were designed to relate him with the legend of &quot;Yamata no Orochi&quot;. The designers ended up liking him so much they are careful of the character&#x27;s development as the series expands. 
As a result, Iori sometimes helps Kyo to have the opportunity to fight him. Finding his design appealing, new outfits presented the SNK staff with difficulties as they devised new appearances for the character that would retain his popularity.

Video game journalists have praised Iori Yagami as one of the most powerful characters in the series. Reviewers have also cited Iori as one of the best characters from the games, labeling him as a veteran character and praising his appearance as one of SNK&#x27;s best creations. &quot;Miss X&quot;, Iori&#x27;s crossdressing form from &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot; and the additional female one of &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, also received attention for its humor. A series of collectible items based on Iori&#x27;s likeness, including key chains and figurines, have been manufactured.

==Conception and creation==
Iori Yagami was created by Yuichiro Hiraki who aimed to create an ideal rival to Kyo Kusanagi&#x27;s character; Since Kyo hot-blooded in some ways, the development team just assumed Iori would be the opposite, cool and blue-blooded. Iori&#x27;s name is loosely based on the Japanese mythological creature Yamata no Orochi. In contrast to Kyo&#x27;s life, SNK decided to keep Iori&#x27;s life as private despite some related material mentioning the fact that Iori has relatives. Though Iori and Kyo first meet in &quot;KOF&quot;, writer Akihiko Ureshino decided to take freedom in his novelizations to foreshadow more their meetings in novels. After watching fan reactions at initial location testing for &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, several staff members predicted Iori would be popular. Iori was created not only to the yang to Kyo&#x27;s ying but also inherit the popularity of the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series. In order to stand out besides being Kyo&#x27;s rival, the plot of the Orochi arc would give Iori a unique Desperation Move that symbolizes his clan&#x27;s past when being corrupted by Orochi: the Forbidden Method 1211: Eight Maidens. &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; was created to explore more the Orochi lore through the new host Chizuru Kagura who wants help from the protagonist and his rival. 

Iori was originally introduced in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; as the leader of a team composed of Billy Kane, Eiji Kisaragi and himself. Each member shares a rivalry with another character in the game. Although the staff members worked hard to impress their superiors at SNK, Iori&#x27;s characterization caused them to discard the team in the next game in the series. In the rival team&#x27;s ending, Iori betrays Billy and Eiji, generating anger from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; developers for what Iori did to their character. 

Iori is a berserker due to the Orochi demon blood within him. This version of the character, officially named &quot;Orochi Iori&quot;, is hinted to have existed before his debut in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot; as one of the game&#x27;s mid-bosses. This form of Iori was designed to easily overpower other characters. Series&#x27; flagship director Toyohisa Tanabe states that the staff were initially reluctant to add this version of Iori to the series&#x27; roster; they were worried about fans&#x27; reactions but did so to add more impact to the Orochi saga&#x27;s climax. Tanabe was particularly pleased to see surprised reactions from female fans to this form during &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot;″s location testing. Another minor development of the character was his change of &quot;most valued possession/valued treasure&quot; information. A girlfriend was also listed in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot;, and &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot;. Starting with &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot; and every entry after that, however, the space is listed as &quot;None&quot;. The SNK staff commented that it is curious that he does not have a girlfriend anymore.

===Portrayal===
After working in 10 &quot;KOF&quot; novelizations, Akihiko Ureshino noted that SNK used Kyo and Iori too much and believed they should be given a rest after &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;. Kyo and Iori were supposed to disappear due to business reasons or the requests of enthusiastic fans, but in the end they have continued to appear ever since. After taking a step back in the &quot;Nests Saga&quot; they are then playing important roles in the &quot;Ash Saga&quot;. The problem is the positioning of these two within the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series. In the &quot;Ash Saga&quot; Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru&#x27;s Three Sacred Treasures play a major role in the &quot;Orochi demon Returns&quot; type story, and in the previous &quot;Nests Saga,&quot; Kyo was involved in the story to some extent, but not Iori, in terms of the connections with the new protagonist K&#x27;. However, the Miera brothers were the main focus of the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; spin-offs relegating Kyo and Iori for the first time to minor characters. Both the Ash arc and &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; games were developed at the same time which resulted in Kyo and Iori still playing a major role in the &quot;Another Day&quot; original video animation that promotes &quot;Maximum Impact 2&quot;. While Kyo and Iori are always arguing with each other, Ureshino was careful with how writing them to the point their introduction in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; added a subtext of happiness of the two rivals meeting again, believing they had died when fighting Orochi and remained as hidden characters. By &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, Ureshino aims to make the relationship between Iori and Kyo important, claiming that should something bad happen to Kyo&#x27;s life, Iori would find no reason for existing. However, he refuses to make Iori act friendlier with Kyo and not mature as it would ruin his original appeal. 

In an interview with Iori&#x27;s Japanese voice actor, Kunihiko Yasui comments that he feels responsible as a voice actor for his performances as Iori, taking care to sound different in each installment as a means of developing and protecting his character&#x27;s humanity. Yasui was replaced by Takanori Hoshino starting in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;; Hoshino said he was delighted to be the new voice actor of the character, thanking SNK. Chisa Horii voices Iori&#x27;s female incarnation in &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;.

===Design===
One of the planned objectives for &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; was to properly introduce Iori as Kyo&#x27;s rival. According to his creators, Iori&#x27;s personality and other aspects of his character such as his phrases and unique moves &quot;broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time&quot; resulting in a unique design from the point of view of the fans. Like Kyo, several aspects of Iori, including his surname and abilities, were designed to relate him to the Japanese legend Yamata no Orochi, which was the inspiration for the plot. The pixel art of Iori was made by Yuichiro Hiraki who, despite leaving SNK to work in another project a few years later, was asked by Capcom&#x27;s Kaname Fujioka to once again work on the character&#x27;s design for the crossover fighting game &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot;. During the early development stages of &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot;, SNK planned to exclude Iori and Kyo from the game because the company wanted to focus the story on the new protagonist, K&#x27;. They reversed this decision because of the characters&#x27; popularity. The repeated appearance of Iori, Kyo, and other SNK regular characters in the series is at the insistence of the marketers and main planners, making it a challenge to decide the story for each title. 
Because of his popularity among fans, some of the series&#x27; main designers have said Iori is &quot;difficult to draw for&quot;. Illustrator Shinkiro said he thought Iori was one of the series&#x27; wildest characters because of his hairstyle; similar sentiments were expressed by &quot;Last Blade&quot; illustrator Tonko. &quot;&quot; producer Falcoon stated that attempting to change an &quot;untouchable&quot; design such as Iori&#x27;s put him under severe pressure. He stated that creating Iori&#x27;s alternative design that appears in the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series almost felt &quot;unforgivable&quot; because he felt unsure of fans&#x27; reaction to the change.

For the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; spin-off games, Iori&#x27;s characteristic hairstyle was changed dramatically. Throughout the series, his normal costume consists of a short jacket and bondage pants; without changing his design and adjusting only his coloring, a diverse number of image variations can be brought about. In &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot; Iori and Kyo were meant to wear new outfit that emphasized their sexual appeal but due to time constraints, they were removed. As a result, they sport similar outfits to the ones seen in Ash arc though there was emphasis in giving Iori the same style. During the making of &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, Nobuyuki Kuroki wanted Iori, except the character&#x27;s hair, to be redesigned. Character designer Eisuke Ogura created a new outfit for Iori and asked the modeler to focus on his masculinity and to pay close attention to the way the design of the character&#x27;s eyes. This new design, alongside Kyo&#x27;s, provoked controversy when it was revealed. &quot;KOF XIV&quot; director Yasuyuki Oda said the team wanted the characters to have new looks because the game is set in another story arc. A new design was created by Tomohiro Nakata for the next game, &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;; He expressed pressure of giving him a proper appeal that makes it worth of the character&#x27;s fame. The new outfit focuses on red and black clothes and continue focusing on drawing the Yagami Crest of the moon in his back as usual.

===Fighting style===
When fighting, Iori employs the &quot;Yagami style of ancient martial arts&quot; as well as an art labelled as &quot;Pure instinct&quot; which involves the usage of purple flames. His strongest technique is known as In &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, Iori&#x27;s gameplay mechanics were modified to become a close-range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques temporarily during KOF XIV, he continued fighting by using his fingernails like claws to scratch his opponents. Iori&#x27;s strongest technique is , a new move that focuses on violent combinations and serves as a reference to the character&#x27;s ending from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;, in which he murders his teammates. Iori&#x27;s 10th color scheme in the game matches that of his classic outfit. During development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. This version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed to avoid surpassing the current Iori so players could choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, in which Iori had his moveset were adjusted for better balance by not using flaming techniques. Meanwhile, the Orochi Iori version was designed to be more overpowered than regular playable character as result of being originally set as a boss.

As downloadable content for &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, SNK added the original Iori Yagami who can wield flames for his fighting style. This version was meant to be innovative similar rather than make him look like his classic &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; persona. Despite being the same person, the playstyle of Iori&#x27;s flames is highly different from the regular Iori whose attacks involve hand-to-hand combat. Nevertheless, he was balanced by SNK in order to avoid making the character be overpowered when exploring his special moves. Some distinguishable moves were given to him in order to give the player multiple options of tactics. This Neo Max was created with the idea of impressing gamers so that they would be attracted to use this version of the character. In &quot;KOFXIV&quot;, the commands for Iori&#x27;s moves were also affected; one of his strongest attacks, the , would require high skill for regular players because SNK attempted to balance the characters. Oda wanted to keep his gameplay intact in order to avoid fan backlash.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
====In &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series====
Iori is a violent, sadistic person who suffers from trauma because of his clan&#x27;s past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan was known as the Yasakani who, With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, sealed the snake demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani clan grew tired of living in the shadow of the Kusanagi and made a blood pact with Orochi that gave them greater powers but cursed the clan and its descendants forever. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. The curse also causes each heir to die young and each mother to die in childbirth. Iori becomes obsessed with killing his heir Kyo, disregarding their clans&#x27; past. This sometimes results in Iori helping Kyo to defeat his enemies and to finish their battles. To find Kyo, Iori sometimes enters the King of Fighters tournaments and uses his teammates as tools to reach him.

Iori Yagami first appeared in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot;, in which he enters an annual tournament as the leader of the Rival Team with Billy Kane and Eiji Kisaragi. Iori learns that the heir of the Kusanagi clan, Kyo, is expected to be there. After the team fails to defeat Kyo&#x27;s team, Iori betrays his teammates. In the next video game, Iori teams up with two women, Vice and Mature, servants of the Orochi demon. During the &#x27;96 competition, Iori meets Chizuru Kagura, the heir of the Yata clan who wants to gather Kyo and Iori on her team to seal Orochi. They defeat the Orochi follower Goenitz but neither Iori nor Kyo agree with the idea. When Iori leaves with his teammates, he cannot control his surge of Orochi power, resulting in their deaths. Iori continues to suffer from multiple outbreaks; during &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot; he attacks other team members and appears as a sub-boss character in the game, depending on the characters the player uses. He later joins Chizuru and Kyo to confront and seal Orochi.

In most versions of &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot;, Iori is a secret character that can be faced as a bonus fight at the end of the game if the player scores enough points. In the story, Iori discovers the creation of Kyo clones and enters the annual tournament, where he finds those responsible, an organization named NESTS. Iori follows the battles in secret and fights against the NESTS&#x27; agents to continue his fight against Kyo. An assistant version of his character named Striker also appears for Iori in &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot; wearing an outfit based on illustrations in artbooks. In &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;, an agent named Seth invites Iori to join his team for the next &quot;King of Fighters&quot; tournament, assuming he would get his shot against Kyo. While his regular form appears in &quot;KOF 2002&quot;, his Orochi form is also featured in the PlayStation 2 port of the game and the remake of &quot;KOF &#x27;98&quot;. In &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot;, Chizuru appears to both Kyo and Iori, asking them to form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who plans to get the power from the descendants of the clans who sealed Orochi and steals the ones from Chizuru.

In the following video game, Iori and Kyo form a team with Kyo&#x27;s student Shingo Yabuki to fill Chizuru&#x27;s spot to stop Ash. At the end of the tournament, the strengthening presence of Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood state, in which he attacks his comrades.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The character Iori Yagami was mostly well received by several video game publications and other media. He is ranked in the top-ten fighting games from &quot;GameTrailers&quot; and has been called one of the series&#x27; innovative characters from his introduction in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; and during his development in the following games. Sohu commented Kyo Kusanagi is more suitable to be the heir of the blood of the Orochi, Iori Yagami overshadows him due to his origins. Kyo and Iori&#x27;s introduction was highly popular to the point Japanese gamers spread rumors they might be brother due to their connection to the myth of Orochi though Chinese comic created bizarre plots involving them. Despite the comics portraying Kyo and Iori&#x27;s deadly enemies, the video game introductions did not go that far and instead used to tease their continuous competitiveness highly lampshaded by how they stare at each other while creating different colored flames. Therefore, Iori Yagami and Kyo Kusanagi still get along very harmoniously in occasions that do not involve &quot;Orochi&quot; but still have misrelationship. According to Atomix, the berserker Iori is nicknamed &quot;Crazy Iori&quot; in Mexico where the franchise is highly popular. Meanwhile, the Japanese have a tendency to call him &quot;Buso Iori&quot;. 

Kevin S. from &quot;GameRevolution&quot; liked the interactions between Kyo and Iori in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; because it was one of the most famous parts from the series. The addition of a unique theme song to Iori&#x27;s and Kyo&#x27;s rival fight was also praised. Meristation compared Kyo&#x27;s and Iori&#x27;s antagonistic rivalry to that of Goku and Vegeta from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga by Akira Toriyama. &quot;The Daily Star&quot; noted Kyo&#x27;s and Iori&#x27;s popularity comes from the way Kyo and Iori start facing each other as enemies but still become allies for other games. The formation of the Three Sacred Treasures Team in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; had a major impact with fans because it was appealing because of the Orochi saga and because of its incorporation of Japanese mythology. In the book &quot;Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific&quot;, Iori was regarded as one of the most popular video game characters in Hong Kong from the mid 1990s onward alongside Kyo, Mai and others, to the point of overshadowing the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters, which were also well-known. The developers of &quot;KOF&quot; noted that Kyo and Iori were very popular in Korea, which led to their immediate inclusion is &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot; which was the first game in the series that was not developed by the original company. 

Across the franchise, Iori has been given new looks and techniques which have also resulted in different kind of responses. The character&#x27;s new design from &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; has been well received by &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s writer Andrew Park who found such moves interesting. On the other hand, &quot;1UP.com&quot; writer Richard Li; Li complained about the lack of Iori&#x27;s signature moves such as his fireballs, and while some of them remained, Li noted that they now require a different input from the ones they normally require. The Orochi form from Iori was listed as the sixth best altered video game character alongside Leona&#x27;s based on the impact both have on the storyline by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; same site also listed him as the fourth best &quot;King of Fighters&quot; characters based on his moves, rivalry with Kyo as well as apparent character arc based on how he retakes his lost powers in &quot;KOF XIII&quot; and used them in &quot;KOF XIV&quot; to once again seal Orochi. The writer noted that while Iori started as &quot;anti-hero&quot; due to his tendency to beat up his own teammates in his first two games, he would join forces Kyo for a greater good in upcoming titles which changed the way he was seen. However, the fact that Iori is defeated by Ash in &quot;KOF XI&quot; was noted to be the opposite due to how much it affected him to the point of creating a new fighting style that does not involve flames.

Todd Ciolek from &quot;Anime News Network&quot; found Iori&#x27;s appearance in &quot;KOF XIV&quot; dated. Meanwhile, Iori&#x27;s return to his classic techniques in &quot;KOF XIV&quot; mainly using flames were celebrated by &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; because of their popularity with fans. Atinux agreed, calling the character &quot;sadistic&quot; because of the violence of his attacks, most notably seen in his strongest moves that reference his enhanced Orochi form from previous games. &quot;Shoryuken&quot; said that while Iori and Vice showed appealing skills in their &quot;KOF XIV&quot; trailer, they were overshadowed by Mature&#x27;s techniques. In response to the negative feedback involving the design, artist Hiroaki Hashimoto said that while Kyo&#x27;s and Iori&#x27;s original designs in the Orochi arc were so appealing, it was hard for SNK to keep coming up with quality with &quot;XIV&quot;. Den of Geek praised Iori&#x27;s Orochi form for being far more violent than his already deadly persona.

Journalists have also commented on Iori&#x27;s appearances outside the &quot;KOF&quot; games. Iori&#x27;s crossdressing persona Miss X has been popular; SNK stated they received multiple requests to add him into the crossover game &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, an upcoming fighting game focused on female characters. &quot;Destructoid&quot; stated he was shocked by Miss X&#x27;s debut in &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot; because of Iori&#x27;s obvious secret identity and because she has different incarnations with a different gender and outfit. Atomix shared similar feelings but refrained from revealing the character&#x27;s true identity. &quot;Universo Nintendo&quot; originally thought the DLC character would be an alternative version of Ash Crimson and was surprised by the revelation. The website said Miss X&#x27;s second form is possibly the most humiliating version because the character is wearing a t-shirt of his rival Kyo. Nevertheless, the character&#x27;s movements were thought to be similar to those of the original Iori and thus long-time gamers would easily play as Miss X. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; found the comic &quot;SVC Chaos&quot; ridiculous because as Iori commits suicide to follow the deceased Kyo to the Underworld.

===Popularity===
Merchandising based on Iori, including figurines, key-chains and puzzles, has been released. Two scale figures based on Iori&#x27;s original form and his &quot;XIV&quot; look have also been released. A replica of his &quot;KOF XIV&quot; coat was produced for merchandising.

To choose the cover for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports of &quot;KOF XII&quot;, Ignition Entertainment started a survey on May 4, 2009, in which users of their forum could vote for one of two covers they wanted to see in the game. While both covers feature multiple characters, one uses Kyo in the center and the other Iori. When the two surveys ended, Ignition started two new ones that asked people to vote between the previous winners and the Japanese covers from the game for both consoles. In late 2018, Iori and other SNK characters appeared as part of collaborations with other companies in Harajuku, Japan, involving new merchandising. Iori&#x27;s image was made by Falcoon. Game designer Masahiro Sakurai was amazed when first seeing Iori in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; due to his attitude and moves which made him praise the designers. In November 2024, Tanita made an official collaboration with SNK which involved merchandising and studying the bodies of Iori among other characters from the series.

<text>In Greek mythology, Ichnaea (Ikhnaia) (), &quot;the tracker&quot; was an epithet that could be applied to Themis, as in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo&quot;, or to Nemesis, who was venerated at Ichnae, a Greek city in Macedon.

== Mythology ==
At the birth of Apollo on Delos according to the Homeric hymn, the goddesses who bear witness to the rightness of the birth are the great goddesses of the old order: Dione, Rhea, the Ichnaean goddess, Themis, and the sea-goddess &quot;loud-moaning&quot; Amphitrite. While, Strabo, in his &quot;Geographica&quot;, says that the &quot;Ichnaean Themis&quot; is worshipped at the town of Ichnae, and William Smith suggests that the name &quot;may have been derived&quot; from the town.

Lycophron evokes her in Alexandra: &quot;...like Guneus, a doer of justice and arbiter of the Sun&#x27;s daughter of Ichnae&quot;.

<doc id="839345" wikidata="Q3238289" url="?curid=839345" title="Lieutenant Governor of Quebec">
<text>The lieutenant governor of Quebec (; , ) is the representative in Quebec of the monarch, who operates distinctly within the province but is also shared equally with the ten other jurisdictions of Canada. The lieutenant governor of Quebec is appointed in the same manner as the other provincial viceroys in Canada and is similarly tasked with carrying out most of the monarch&#x27;s constitutional and ceremonial duties. The present and 30th lieutenant governor of Quebec is Manon Jeannotte, who has served in the role since January 25, 2024.

==Role and presence==

The lieutenant governor of Quebec is tasked with a number of governmental duties. Not among them, though, is delivering the Throne Speech, which sets the lieutenant governor of Quebec apart from the other Canadian viceroys. (Instead, new parliaments begin with the Opening Speech by the premier.) The lieutenant governor is also expected to undertake various ceremonial roles. For instance, upon installation, the lieutenant governor automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Vice-Prior in Quebec of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. The lieutenant governor will present numerous other provincial honours and decorations and various awards that are named for and presented by the lieutenant governor, which were reinstated in 2000 by Lieutenant Governor Lise Thibault. These honours are presented at official ceremonies, which count among hundreds of other engagements the lieutenant governor takes part in each year, either as host or guest of honour; in 2006, the lieutenant governor of Quebec undertook 400 engagements and 200 in 2007.


At these events, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s presence is marked by the lieutenant governor&#x27;s standard, consisting of a blue field bearing the escutcheon of the Arms of Majesty in Right of Quebec surmounted by a crown and set within a white disc; the Quebec viceregal flag is only one of two that are significantly different from all the others in Canada. Within Quebec, the lieutenant governor also follows only the sovereign in the province&#x27;s order of precedence, preceding even other members of the Canadian Royal Family and the &#x27;s federal representative.
It has been argued by Jeremy Webber and Robert Andrew Young that, as the office is the core of authority in the province, the secession of Quebec from the Confederation would first require the abolition or transformation of the post of lieutenant governor of Quebec; such an amendment to the constitution of Canada could not be done without, according to Section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982, the approval of the federal parliament and all other provincial legislatures in Canada. Others, such as J. Woehrling, however, have claimed that the legislative process towards Quebec&#x27;s independence would not require any prior change to the viceregal post. Young also felt that the lieutenant governor could refuse Royal Assent to a bill that proposed to put an unclear question on sovereignty to referendum or was based on the results of a referendum that asked such a question.

==History==

The lieutenant governor of Quebec came into being in 1867, upon the creation of Quebec at Confederation. Since that date, 28 lieutenant governors have served the province, amongst whom were notable firsts, such as Lise Thibault—the first female and first disabled lieutenant governor of the province. The shortest mandate by a lieutenant governor of Quebec was that of Sir Lomer Gouin, from January to March 1929, while the longest was Hugues Lapointe, from 1966 to 1978.
One of the few examples in Canada of a viceroy exercising the royal prerogative against or without ministerial advice came in 1887, when Lieutenant Governor Auguste-Réal Angers dismissed the Cabinet headed by Premier Honoré Mercier; a report concluded that Mercier&#x27;s government had benefited from a kickback scheme with contractors building the Baie des Chaleurs railway.

The appointment of Jean-Louis Roux as lieutenant governor of Quebec by Governor General Roméo LeBlanc, on the advice of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, stirred controversy, as Roux was well known as a strong opponent of Quebec independence and, soon after he took up the post, it was revealed that, as a university student in the 1940s, he had worn a swastika on his lab coat in protest of the proposal to invoke conscription for service in World War II and had participated in an antisemitic protest. Roux had, in an interview after his appointment as lieutenant governor, stated that he might have to use the reserve powers of the Crown should certain circumstances arise following a referendum result in favour of Quebec&#x27;s separation from Canada; a statement that displeased Roux&#x27;s premier at the time, Lucien Bouchard. The following year, Bouchard tabled in the legislature three motions, calling the Office of the lieutenant governor &quot;a heritage of the colonial past&quot;, the appointment process controversial and interfering, and demanding the post be abolished, though, until then, the federal Crown-in-Council should appoint a person &quot;democratically designated by the Quebec Assembly&quot;.

==Residences and offices==

Since 1997 there has been no official residence; the lieutenant governors must instead obtain their own home in or near the capital. However, they still retain an official office at Édifice André-Laurendeau.

Previous residences includes Maison Sewell at 87, rue Saint-Louis (still standing), Spencer Wood from 1870 to 1966 (destroyed by fire 1966) and 1010 rue St. Louis (Maison Dunn) from 1967 to 1997.

<doc id="839348" wikidata="Q36214" url="?curid=839348" title="Puerto Montt">
<text>Puerto Montt (Mapuche: Meli Pulli) is a port city and commune in southern Chile, located at the northern end of the Reloncaví Sound in the Llanquihue Province, Los Lagos Region, 1,055 km to the south of the capital, Santiago. The commune spans an area of and has a population of 245,902 in 2017. It is bounded by the communes of Puerto Varas to the north, Cochamó to the east and southeast, Calbuco to the southwest and Maullín and Los Muermos to the west.

Founded as late as 1853 during the German colonization of southern Chile, Puerto Montt soon outgrew older neighboring cities through its strategic position at the southern end of the Chilean Central Valley being a gateway city into the Chiloé Archipelago, the Llanquihue and Nahuel Huapi lakes and Western Patagonia.

Puerto Montt has gained renown and grown significantly through the rise of Chile to become the second largest salmon producer of the world during the 1990s and 2000s. However, the Chilean salmon aquaculture crisis of the late 2000s resulted in severe unemployment and exposed weaknesses in the local economy. The city&#x27;s cultural endowment mixes elements of Chilean-Spanish culture with a German heritage. The city has attracted a significant number of newcomers from all over Chile in the last 30 years in search of employment opportunities.

==History==
Originally, the site was covered by thick forest and was called &quot;Melipulli&quot; (which means &quot;four hills&quot; in Mapudungun). It was selected as an entrance to Lake Llanquihue when its proximity to the open sea was discovered. The expedition was entrusted to Bernardo Philippi, a German naturalist and cartographer, but after his death in 1851, Vicente Perez Rosales took over his duties, and by the end of September started to chop trees at Reloncaví sound using local woodsman coming from Huar, Maillen, Huelmo and Calbuco Mainly. By December, after the forest was cut down, the area was burned to clear the land in anticipation of completing the settlement plan. The city itself was founded on February 12, 1853, after government-sponsored immigration from Germany that began in 1848 populated the region and integrated it politically to the rest of the country. It was named after Manuel Montt, President of Chile between 1851 and 1861, who set in motion the German immigration.

In 1912, the city was connected by train to Santiago, making it an important point of entry into Chilean Patagonia and augmenting its commercial development. By 1950, it had a population of 27,500, and the city was rapidly urbanizing. However, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake destroyed much of Puerto Montt, collapsing the port and the train station along with many building and houses. Eventually the city recovered, becoming once again an important urban centre as well as a port of national interest.

===1969 violence===

At the start of March 1969, approximately 90 landless people received poor advice from Socialist Member of Parliament Luis Espinoza. The families were never granted land needed to build their homes. On March 4, 1969, the families settled on empty, unoccupied farmland owned by an absentee landlord. The families sought squatters&#x27; rights. Approximately four to five days after moving onto the land, the local Police Chief Rolando Rodríguez Marbán assured the squatters that they would not be disturbed, and could proceed with their home construction. Unfortunately, the Ministry of the Interior changed their orders, which led to tragic results.

On midnight on March 9, Espinoza was charged with breaking the law, arrested, and moved to the city of Valdivia, where he was held. Following direct orders from the Minister of Interior Edmundo Pérez Zujovic, 250 armed policemen launched an assault on the squatting families at dawn. Eight squatters were shot dead. Two squatters, a 9-month child and an adult later died from their wounds. The newly built homes were decimated. The massacre is poignantly memorialized by singer-songwriter Víctor Jara in his song Preguntas por Puerto Montt.

The massacre of Puerto Montt and the public outcry that followed were major factors contributing to the defeat of Eduardo Frei&#x27;s party in the Chilean presidential election of 1970 which was succeeded by Salvador Allende&#x27;s Unidad Popular.

===Late 20th century===
By 1979, Puerto Montt was nominated and later become the Capital of Los Lagos Region, thereby becoming the principal administrative, political and commercial centre of Southern Chile.

By 1982, the commune already reached 103,680 inhabitants. From the late 1980s, the city began to experience a new accelerated growth, both in population and in the economic sphere, mainly due to the installation of the industry Chilean salmon farm, of which Puerto Montt became its nerve center.

==Demographics==
According to the 2017 census, Puerto Montt has 245,902 inhabitants (121,019 men and 124,883 women), of which 25,759 live in rural areas and 220,143 live in urban areas. From 218,858 inhabitants in the 2012 census, the population grew by 12.36% (27,044 people).

Of the overall population, 52,483 belong to indigenous groups, with 50,247 being Mapuche, 314 Aymara people, 73 Rapa Nui people, 19 Lican Antai, 84 Quechua people, 27 Colla, 136 Diaguita, 114 Kawésqar, 38 Yahgan, 175 other and 1,256 declaring indigenous status but not identifying a group.

About 1.46% of the population (3,595 people) are immigrants, with 199 reporting originating from Peru, 596 from Colombia, 269 from Venezuela, 40 from Bolivia, 1,527 from Argentina, 44 from Haiti, 194 from Ecuador, 157 from South America, 153 from Central America and the Caribbean, 52 from North America, 242 from Europe, 83 from Asia, 16 from Africa, 6 from Oceania and 17 not declaring.

== Climate ==
Puerto Montt has a wet oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with heavy rainfall throughout the year but a drying trend in the summer. Although temperatures are consistently below , frosts are very rare and occur only a couple of times per month in the winter. For the 41st parallel south, closer to the equator than to the South Pole, Puerto Montt is much cooler than areas further inland in terms of summer temperatures, due to cool ocean currents nearby. This is compounded by the lack of a sizeable landmass on those parallels in the southern hemisphere. That means that Puerto Montt has much cooler summers than areas at similar distances from the equator in the northern hemisphere.

==Economy==

Puerto Montt is the capital of the Los Lagos Region and the Llanquihue Province, and the main sea port at the lower end of Chile&#x27;s western continental land. The city is the principal commercial, services, and financial hub of the Chilean Northern Patagonia—Zona Austral.

Puerto Montt is also the gateway to the Chiloé Archipelago and Chiloé Island across the Chacao Channel, and the many other smaller islands in Chile&#x27;s inland Sea of Chiloé.

The city&#x27;s economy is now based upon agriculture, cattle, and forestry on the surrounding islands, and fishing and salmon aquaculture in the fjords and nearby Pacific Ocean.

=== History ===

During the 19th century, before and after the founding of Puerto Montt, the extraction and commercialization of wood, mainly larch, was the main economic activity in the area. Other existing items since the creation of the city were, to a lesser extent, alcohol distilleries, grain oil factories, breweries and the sale of items imported from Germany or Valparaíso. Puerto Montt, as the capital, was vital in the entry and exit of merchandise to the area, since the seaway was the only way to get the products out - the train would only arrive in 1912.
;Salmon aquaculture
The city is configured as the hub of one of the largest salmon aquaculture industries in the world. Hatcheries, fisheries and packing plants are mostly located south of Puerto Montt. Fresh salmon is flown daily to world markets and frozen salmon is shipped by ocean to all destinations. The tremendous growth of the region, mainly due to the salmon industry, but also due to rapid expansion of forestry, cattle, and tourism, has proven the massive economic potential of Puerto Montt and its surrounding area.

==Transport==
El Tepual Airport is the main commercial airport serving the city. Three airlines operate regular flights to and from Santiago, Punta Arenas, Balmaceda, and Antofagasta. The airlines operating at the airport are LATAM Airlines (the country&#x27;s largest), Sky Airline and JetSmart. The flight time to Santiago is approximately two hours.

Additionally, Marcel Marchant Aerodrome (La Paloma) connects the city with remote locations within the Patagonian Fjords.

Erickson&#x27;s &quot;Morning Briefing&quot; e-mails grew from 498 subscribers when they began in February 2009 to nearly 70,000 by January 2010. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that &quot;The ability of a single e-mail to shape a message illustrates the power of the conservative network.&quot; The article described Erickson as one of the American conservative movement&#x27;s &quot;key national players&quot;.

Erickson wrote the &quot;Confessions of a Political Junkie&quot; blog and is former editor-in-chief of the &quot;Peach Pundit&quot; blog. In 2010, he co-authored a book called &quot;Red State Uprising: How to Take Back America&quot; with Lew Uhler. Later that month, Erickson said that his parents refused to serve him &quot;Asian food&quot; when he was a child on December 7, the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Erickson&#x27;s mother appeared to deny the claim to a journalist. Erickson criticized the report, citing his mother&#x27;s age.

In 2014, RedState was sold to Salem Media Group, who replaced Erickson. In December 2015, Erickson left his position at the site to focus on his radio show.

===Television and radio===
From 2010 to January 2013, Erickson was a political contributor at CNN. Erickson was a contributor to FOX News from 2013 to 2018. Erickson later alleged that Roger Ailes terminated his affiliation with the network because of his criticism of Senator Mitch McConnell.

In January 2011, Erickson began hosting a local evening radio show on WSB Radio 95.5/750, replacing Michael Savage. Erickson moved to the slot vacated by Herman Cain when he announced his 2012 presidential bid. In 2014 and 2015, Erickson guest-hosted the national broadcast of &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; numerous times. Rush Limbaugh died on February 17, 2021, and Erickson took over the late host’s three-hour midday time slot in the Atlanta radio market in March 2021. Toward the end of Erickson&#x27;s career at &quot;RedState&quot;, he began to increase his focus on his radio show, which is now syndicated by the Cox Media Group to other conservative talk radio stations around the U.S. He eventually quit the site to work on the radio program full-time.

===The Resurgent===
In January 2016, Erickson launched the conservative website &quot;The Resurgent&quot;.

==Political views and controversies==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of London put Erickson on its &quot;List of Most Influential US Conservatives&quot;, giving him a rank of 69th most influential in 2007 and 65th in 2010. According to the 2007 newspaper article: &quot;Erickson epitomises the new power of the internet. A small-government fiscal and social conservative based in the South, he taps into and influences the Republican &#x27;base&#x27; that the GOP&#x27;s 2008 candidates are courting.&quot; According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Erickson&#x27;s conservatism is more traditional (as opposed to libertarian) and &quot;deeply informed by his evangelical faith&quot;. Erickson emphasizes small government, strong national defense, and the primacy of the traditional family.

===Donald Trump===
During a CNN interview after a Republican Party debate hosted by Fox News on August 6, 2015, Donald Trump had said that Fox News anchor and debate co-moderator Megyn Kelly had &quot;blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever&quot; while questioning him during the debate. The next day, Erickson disinvited Trump from a &quot;RedState&quot; gathering held in Atlanta, calling Trump&#x27;s remark &quot;a bridge too far&quot; and that even &quot;blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross&quot; certain lines, including decency. The following day, Trump released a statement stating that Erickson had a history of making controversial statements for which he has had to apologize, and that he, Trump, was an outsider who did not fit into Erickson&#x27;s agenda.

Erickson described Trump as &quot;a racist&quot; and &quot;a fascist&quot;, and insisted, &quot;I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever.&quot; Nevertheless, in February 2019, Erickson endorsed Trump for re-election in the 2020 presidential election.

=== Gender ===
In 2013, Erickson was criticized by Elle Reeve in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; for saying in an interview on Fox Business Network that males dominate females in the &quot;natural world&quot; and it was only &quot;science&quot; for men to be the breadwinners for their families.

=== Guns ===
In December 2015, Erickson posted a picture of a bullet-ridden copy of &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he had shot at. That day&#x27;s edition contained a front-page editorial in favor of gun control.

Erickson spread a false story by RedState which claimed that 17-year old Parkland, Florida school shooting survivor David Hogg was not actually at the Parkland school when it was attacked. He later described Hogg as a &quot;bully&quot; after Hogg called for an advertiser boycott of Fox News host Laura Ingraham when she mocked him for not getting into a number of universities.

=== LGBT rights ===
In August 2017, Erickson was one of several co-authors of the so-called Nashville Statement, which affirmed &quot;that it is sinful to approve of homosexual immorality or transgenderism and that such approval constitutes an essential departure from Christian faithfulness and witness.&quot; The statement, which was described as a &quot;vicious, anti-LGBTQ manifesto&quot; by the progressive activist group Human Rights Campaign, was attacked by some Christian leaders.

=== Attacks on public figures ===
In April 2009, Erickson described retiring Supreme Court Justice David Souter on his Twitter account as &quot;the only goat fucking child molester to ever serve on the Supreme Court&quot;. In an appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, Erickson said the statement was &quot;not my finest hour.&quot; 

Erickson called Texas state senator Wendy Davis &quot;Abortion Barbie&quot;. In a blog post, Erickson considered whether President Barack Obama was &quot;shagging hookers&quot; and wondered whether Michelle Obama (whom he called a &quot;Marxist harpy&quot;) &quot;would go Lorena Bobbit [&quot;sic&quot;] on him should he even think about it.&quot; Erickson argued that President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize because of an &quot;affirmative action quota.&quot; Erickson compared the Obama administration&#x27;s health care communications director Linda Douglass to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.

=== Augusto Pinochet ===
In November 2018, Erickson tweeted that foreign aid to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico would be more effectively spent installing &quot;Pinochet types&quot; in these countries. He added that the US should &quot;support strong leaders who support free market reforms and promote economic stability, even if with a heavy hand&quot;. When challenged on this proposal, Erickson replied &quot;I&#x27;m hoping for some helicopters in this plan&quot;, a reference to the Death flights in Chile during Pinochet&#x27;s regime.

Kathryn Sikkink, a professor in International Relations at the Harvard Kennedy School, responded to Erickson&#x27;s remarks. She noted that &quot;Pinochet was a Chilean dictator who committed massive human rights abuses,&quot; and that Erickson got the &quot;facts exactly backward. Recent history and social science don&#x27;t show that authoritarian regimes stop people from fleeing across borders. They show that they make more people want to flee.&quot;

<doc id="839356" wikidata="Q1402679" url="?curid=839356" title="Mountbatten pink">
<text>Mountbatten pink, also called Plymouth Pink, is a naval camouflage colour resembling greyish mauve. It was first used by Lord Mountbatten of the British Royal Navy during World War II. After noticing a Union-Castle Line ship with a similar camouflage colour disappearing from sight, he applied the colour to his own ships, believing the colour would render his ships difficult to see during dawn and dusk. While the colour was met with anecdotal success, it was judged by experts to be equivalent to neutral greys at best and would make ships with the colour more obvious at worst.

==History==

In 1940, while escorting a convoy, Lord Mountbatten noted that one ship in the group vanished from view much earlier than the remainder. The ship, a Union-Castle liner, was painted lavender mauve grey. Mountbatten thus became convinced of the colour&#x27;s effectiveness as a camouflage during dawn and dusk, often dangerous times for ships, and had all of the destroyers of his flotilla painted with a similar pigment, which he created by mixing a medium grey with a small amount of Venetian red. By early 1941, several other ships began using the same camouflage, though no formal testing was done to determine how well it worked.

A later refinement of the basic Mountbatten pink camouflage was the use of a slightly lighter tone of the same colour for the upper structures of the ship. By the end of 1942, however, all vessels of destroyer size and larger had dispensed with Mountbatten pink, although it is believed that smaller vessels retained this colour until well into 1944. The primary problem with Mountbatten pink was that it stood out around midday, when the sky was no longer pink, and the traditional battleship grey was much less visible.

The US Navy had experimented with a similar shade of paint as well, and at least one ship, the USS &quot;Winslow&quot;, received such a paint scheme.

The Kriegsmarine likewise experimented with a light pink shade. The Royal Navy prisoner interrogation report of crew rescued from S 147, a Schnellboot sunk in the English Channel in April 1944, states they believed the boat&#x27;s overall pink shade was effective.

==Usefulness==

One of the anecdotal and possibly apocryphal tales told in support of Mountbatten pink was the story of the cruiser HMS &quot;Kenya&quot; (nicknamed &quot;The Pink Lady&quot; at the time due to her Mountbatten pink paint), which during Operation Archery covered a commando raid against installations on Vågsøy Island off the Norwegian coast. The Germans fired on the &quot;Kenya&quot; for several minutes with coastal guns but she sustained only minor damage from near misses. This was attributed to her Mountbatten pink camouflage blending in with the pink marker dye the Germans were using in their shells, preventing German spotters from distinguishing between shell splashes and the ship. Stories like this, and personal experience of ships with the colour disappearing from view, made crews of ships with the colour notable supporters.

Camouflage experts have noted that the colour may make ships more obvious as a result of the Purkinje effect. These experts also often complained about uncontrolled mixing, which could result in mixtures containing more red than intended; such a mixture could be disastrous, as ships with even the slightest red tone attracted more attention than those with an equivalent tone of blue in almost every light level. An Admiralty handbook concluded that the paint was &quot;neither more nor less effective in sea-going camouflage than neutral greys of equivalent tone; and, further, that if the red content were high enough for the particular characteristics of red to have any effect, the colour would generally hinder rather than aid concealment&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, the EFF DES cracker (nicknamed &quot;Deep Crack&quot;) is a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in 1998, to perform a brute force search of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher&#x27;s key space – that is, to decrypt an encrypted message by trying every possible key. The aim in doing this was to prove that the key size of DES was not sufficient to be secure.

Detailed technical data of this machine, including block diagrams, circuit schematics, VHDL source code of the custom chips and its emulator, have all been published in the book &quot;Cracking DES&quot;.

DES uses a 56-bit key, meaning that there are 256 possible keys under which a message can be encrypted. This is exactly 72,057,594,037,927,936, or approximately 72 quadrillion possible keys. One of the major criticisms of DES, when proposed in 1975, was that the key size was too short. Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie of Stanford University estimated that a machine fast enough to test that many keys in a day would have cost about $20 million in 1976, an affordable sum to national intelligence agencies such as the US National Security Agency. Subsequent advances in the price/performance of chips kept reducing that cost until, twenty years later, it became affordable for even a small nonprofit organization such as the EFF to mount a realistic attack.

==The DES challenges==
DES was a federal standard, and the US government encouraged the use of DES for all non-classified data. RSA Security wished to demonstrate that DES&#x27;s key length was not enough to ensure security, so they set up the DES Challenges in 1997, offering a monetary prize. The first DES Challenge was solved in 96 days by the DESCHALL Project led by Rocke Verser in Loveland, Colorado. RSA Security set up DES Challenge II-1, which was solved by distributed.net in 39 days in January and February 1998.

In 1998, the EFF built Deep Crack (named in reference to IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue chess computer) for less than $250,000. In response to DES Challenge II-2, on July 15, 1998, Deep Crack decrypted a DES-encrypted message after only 56 hours of work, winning $10,000. The brute force attack showed that cracking DES was actually a very practical proposition. Most governments and large corporations could reasonably build a machine like Deep Crack.

Six months later, in response to RSA Security&#x27;s DES Challenge III, and in collaboration with distributed.net, the EFF used Deep Crack to decrypt another DES-encrypted message, winning another $10,000. This time, the operation took less than a day – 22 hours and 15 minutes. The decryption was completed on January 19, 1999. In October of that year, DES was reaffirmed as a federal standard, but this time the standard recommended Triple DES.

The small key space of DES and relatively high computational costs of Triple DES resulted in its replacement by AES as a Federal standard, effective May 26, 2002.

==Technology==
Deep Crack was designed by Cryptography Research, Inc., Advanced Wireless Technologies, and the EFF. The principal designer was Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Research. Advanced Wireless Technologies built 1,856 custom ASIC DES chips (called &quot;Deep Crack&quot; or &quot;AWT-4500&quot;), housed on 29 circuit boards of 64 chips each. The boards were then fitted in six cabinets and mounted in a Sun-4/470 chassis.

The search was coordinated by a single PC which assigned ranges of keys to the chips. The entire machine was capable of testing over 90 billion keys per second. It would take about 9 days to test every possible key at that rate. On average, the correct key would be found in half that time.

In 2006, another custom hardware attack machine was designed based on FPGAs. COPACOBANA (COst-optimized PArallel COdeBreaker) is able to crack DES at considerably lower cost. This advantage is mainly due to progress in integrated circuit technology. 

In July 2012, security researchers David Hulton and Moxie Marlinspike unveiled a cloud computing tool for breaking the MS-CHAPv2 protocol by recovering the protocol&#x27;s DES encryption keys by brute force. This tool effectively allows members of the general public to recover a DES key from a known plaintext–ciphertext pair in about 24 hours.

<doc id="839361" wikidata="Q2943106" url="?curid=839361" title="Caulobacter crescentus">
<text>Caulobacter crescentus is a Gram-negative, oligotrophic bacterium widely distributed in fresh water lakes and streams. The taxon is more properly known as &quot;Caulobacter vibrioides&quot; (Henrici and Johnson 1935).

&quot;C. crescentus&quot; is an important model organism for studying the regulation of the cell cycle, asymmetric cell division, and cellular differentiation. &quot;Caulobacter&quot; daughter cells have two very different forms. One daughter is a mobile &quot;swarmer&quot; cell that has a single flagellum at one cell pole that provides swimming motility for chemotaxis. The other daughter, called the &quot;stalked&quot; cell, has a tubular stalk structure protruding from one pole that has an adhesive holdfast material on its end, with which the stalked cell can adhere to surfaces. Swarmer cells differentiate into stalked cells after a short period of motility. Chromosome replication and cell division only occurs in the stalked cell stage. 

&quot;C. crescentus&quot; derives its name from its crescent shape, which is caused by the protein crescentin. It is an interesting organism to study because it inhabits nutrient-poor aquatic environments. Their ability to thrive in low levels of nutrients is facilitated by its dimorphic developmental cycle. The swarmer cell has a flagellum that protrudes from a single pole and is unable to initiate DNA replication unless differentiated into a stalked cell. The differentiation process includes a morphological transition characterized by ejection of its flagellum and growth of a stalk at the same pole. Stalked cells can elongate and replicate their DNA while growing a flagellum at the opposite pole, giving rise to a pre-divisional cell. Although the precise function of stalks is still being investigated, it is likely that the stalks are involved in the uptake of nutrients in nutrient-limited conditions. Its use as a model originated with developmental biologist Lucy Shapiro.

==Strains==
In the laboratory, researchers distinguish between &quot;C. crescentus&quot; strain CB15 (the strain originally isolated from a freshwater lake) and NA1000 (the primary experimental strain). In strain NA1000, which was derived from CB15 in the 1970s, the stalked and predivisional cells can be physically separated in the laboratory from new swarmer cells, while cell types from strain CB15 cannot be physically separated. The isolated swarmer cells can then be grown as a synchronized cell culture. Detailed study of the molecular development of these cells as they progress through the cell cycle has enabled researchers to understand &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle regulation in great detail. Due to this capacity to be physically synchronized, strain NA1000 has become the predominant experimental &quot;Caulobacter&quot; strain throughout the world. Additional phenotypic differences between the two strains have subsequently accumulated due to selective pressures on the NA1000 strain in the laboratory environment. The genetic basis of the phenotypic differences between the two strains results from coding, regulatory, and insertion/deletion polymorphisms at five chromosomal loci. &quot;C. crescentus&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Caulobacter vibrioides&quot;.

==Genomics==

The &quot;Caulobacter&quot; CB15 genome has 4,016,942 base pairs in a single circular chromosome encoding 3,767 genes. The genome contains multiple clusters of genes encoding proteins essential for survival in a nutrient-poor habitat. Included are those involved in chemotaxis, outer membrane channel function, degradation of aromatic ring compounds, and the breakdown of plant-derived carbon sources, in addition to many extracytoplasmic function sigma factors, providing the organism with the ability to respond to a wide range of environmental fluctuations. In 2010, the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; NA1000 strain was sequenced and all differences with the CB15 &quot;wild type&quot; strain were identified.

==Role of the swarmer cell stage==
The &quot;Caulobacter&quot; stalked cell stage provides a fitness advantage by anchoring the cell to surfaces to form biofilms and or to exploit nutrient sources. Generally, the bacterial species that divides fastest will be most effective at exploiting resources and effectively occupying ecological niches. Yet, &quot;Caulobacter&quot; has the swarmer cell stage that results in slower population growth. The swarmer cell is thought to provide cell dispersal, so that the organism constantly seeks out new environments. This may be particularly useful in severely nutrient-limited environments when the scant resources available can be depleted very quickly. Many, perhaps most, of the swarmer daughter cells will not find a productive environment, but the obligate dispersal stage must increase the reproductive fitness of the species as a whole.

==Cell cycle==
The &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle regulatory system controls many modular subsystems that organize the progression of cell growth and reproduction. A control system constructed using biochemical and genetic logic circuitry organizes the timing of initiation of each of these subsystems. The central feature of the cell cycle regulation is a cyclical genetic circuit—a cell cycle engine—that is centered around the successive interactions of five master regulatory proteins: DnaA, GcrA, CtrA, SciP, and CcrM whose roles were worked out by the laboratories of Lucy Shapiro and Harley McAdams. These five proteins directly control the timing of expression of over 200 genes. The five master regulatory proteins are synthesized and then eliminated from the cell one after the other over the course of the cell cycle. Several additional cell signaling pathways are also essential to the proper functioning of this cell cycle engine. The principal role of these signaling pathways is to ensure reliable production and elimination of the CtrA protein from the cell at just the right times in the cell cycle.

An essential feature of the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle is that the chromosome is replicated once and only once per cell cycle. This is in contrast to the &quot;E. coli&quot; cell cycle where there can be overlapping rounds of chromosome replication simultaneously underway. The opposing roles of the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; DnaA and CtrA proteins are essential to the tight control of &quot;Caulobacter&quot; chromosome replication. The DnaA protein acts at the origin of replication to initiate the replication of the chromosome. The CtrA protein, in contrast, acts to block initiation of replication, so it must be removed from the cell before chromosome replication can begin. Multiple additional regulatory pathways integral to cell cycle regulation and involving both phospho signaling pathways and regulated control of protein proteolysis act to assure that DnaA and CtrA are present in the cell just exactly when needed.

Each process activated by the proteins of the cell cycle engine involve a cascade of many reactions. The longest subsystem cascade is DNA replication. In &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cells, replication of the chromosome involves about 2 million DNA synthesis reactions for each arm of the chromosome over 40 to 80 min depending on conditions. While the average time for each individual synthesis reaction can be estimated from the observed average total time to replicate the chromosome, the actual reaction time for each reaction varies widely around the average rate. This leads to a significant and inevitable cell-to-cell variation time to complete replication of the chromosome. There is similar random variation in the rates of progression of all the other subsystem reaction cascades. The net effect is that the time to complete the cell cycle varies widely over the cells in a population even when they all are growing in identical environmental conditions. Cell cycle regulation includes feedback signals that pace progression of the cell cycle engine to match progress of events at the regulatory subsystem level in each particular cell. This control system organization, with a controller (the cell cycle engine) driving a complex system, with modulation by feedback signals from the controlled system creates a closed loop control system.

The rate of progression of the cell cycle is further adjusted by additional signals arising from cellular sensors that monitor environmental conditions (for example, nutrient levels and the oxygen level) or the internal cell status (for example, presence of DNA damage).

==Evolutionary conservation of the cell cycle control system==
The control circuitry that directs and paces &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle progression involves the entire cell operating as an integrated system. The control circuitry monitors the environment and the internal state of the cell, including the cell topology, as it orchestrates activation of cell cycle subsystems and &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot; asymmetric cell division. The proteins of the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle control system and its internal organization are co-conserved across many alphaproteobacteria species, but there are great differences in the regulatory apparatus&#x27; functionality and peripheral connectivity to other cellular subsystems from species to species. The &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle control system has been exquisitely optimized by evolutionary selection as a total system for robust operation in the face of internal stochastic noise and environmental uncertainty.

The bacterial cell&#x27;s control system has a hierarchical organization. The signaling and the control subsystem interfaces with the environment by means of sensory modules largely located on the cell surface. The genetic network logic responds to signals received from the environment and from internal cell status sensors to adapt the cell to current conditions. A major function of the top level control is to ensure that the operations involved in the cell cycle occur in the proper temporal order. In &quot;Caulobacter&quot;, this is accomplished by the genetic regulatory circuit composed of five master regulators and an associated phospho-signaling network. The phosphosignaling network monitors the state of progression of the cell cycle and plays an essential role in accomplishing asymmetric cell division. The cell cycle control system manages the time and place of the initiation of chromosome replication and cytokinesis as well as the development of polar organelles. Underlying all these operations are the mechanisms for production of protein and structural components and energy production. The “housekeeping” metabolic and catabolic subsystems provide the energy and the molecular raw materials for protein synthesis, cell wall construction and other operations of the cell. The housekeeping functions are coupled bidirectionally to the cell cycle control system. However, they can adapt, somewhat independently of the cell cycle control logic, to changing composition and levels of the available nutrient sources.

The proteins of the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle control system are widely co-conserved across the alphaproteobacteria, but the ultimate function of this regulatory system varies widely in different species. These evolutionary changes reflect enormous differences between the individual species in fitness strategies and ecological niches. For example, &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; is a plant pathogen, &quot;Brucella abortus&quot; is an animal pathogen, and &quot;Sinorhizobium meliloti&quot; is a soil bacterium that invades, and becomes a symbiont in, plant root nodules that fix nitrogen yet most of the proteins of the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; cell cycle control are also found in these species. The specific coupling between the protein components of the cell cycle control network and the downstream readout of the circuit differ from species to species. The pattern is that the internal functionality of the network circuitry is conserved, but the coupling at the “edges” of the regulatory apparatus to the proteins controlling specific cellular functions differs widely among the different species.

==The evolution of stalk positioning in the &quot;Caulobacter&quot; clade==

&quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot; is a member of a group of bacteria that possess the stalk structure, a tubular extension from the cell body. However, the positioning of the stalk is not necessarily conserved at the pole of the cell body in different closely related species. Specifically, research has shown that not only the position of the stalk can change, but the number can vary as well in the closely related genus &quot;Asticcacaulis&quot;. SpmX, a polarly localized protein in &quot;Caulobacter crescentus,&quot; has been shown to manipulate stalk positioning in these &quot;Asticcacaulis&quot; species. Presumably, It does so by a gain of function after protein expansion from around 400 amino acids in &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot; to more than 800 amino acids in &quot;Asticcacaulis&quot; species.

==Caulobacter aging==
&quot;Caulobacter&quot; was the first asymmetric bacterium shown to age. Reproductive senescence was measured as the decline in the number of progeny produced over time. On the basis of experimental evolution studies in &quot;C. crescentus&quot;, Ackermann et al. suggested that aging is probably a fundamental property of all cellular organisms. A similar phenomenon has since been described in the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, which gives rise to morphologically similar daughter cells.

== Cell polarity regulation ==
In &quot;C. crescentus&quot;, cell polarity is readily apparent by the assembly of polar organelles and by the polarization of the division plane, which results in the generation of stalked progeny that are longer than swarmer progeny. The formation of new cell poles at division implies that cell polarity must be re-established in the stalked progeny and reversed in the swarmer progeny.

The &quot;C. crescentus&quot; life cycle is governed by regulators such as TipN, a cell cycle protein. Yale University&#x27;s data strongly suggest a model in which TipN regulates the orientation of the polarity axis by providing a positional cue from the preceding cell cycle. In this model TipN specifies the site of the most recent division by identifying the new pole. The cell uses this positional information as a source of intracellular asymmetry to establish and maintain the orientation of the polarity axis, which is crucial for polar morphogenesis and division. Recruitment of TipN to the nascent poles at the end of the division cycle redefines the identity of the poles and resets the correct polarity in both future daughter cells (with a polarity reversal in the swarmer cell). The cell cycle–regulated synthesis and removal of these polarly localized structures have provided a rich playground for the identification of landmark proteins important for their proper localization. TipN has two transmembrane regions in the N-terminal region and a large C-terminal coiled-coil domain. TipN homologues are present in other alpha-proteobacteria. TipN localizes to the new pole in both daughter cells after division and relocalizes to the cell division site in the late predivisional cell. Therefore, both daughter cells have TipN at the new pole after division.

The landmark protein TipN is essential for the proper placement of the flagellum. Mutants lacking TipN make serious mistakes in development. Instead of making a single flagellum at the correct cell pole , the cell makes multiple flagella at various locations, even on the stalk.

Cell development involves many such proteins working together. Fig#1 shows how TipN interact with two other polar proteins : the flagellar marker PodJ , and the stalk marker DivJ.

<text>is a replica castle in Iwakuni, Yamaguchi, Japan. The nearby Kintai Bridge was originally a footbridge over the Nishiki River to the main gate of the castle.

==History==
This castle was originally constructed by Kikkawa Hiroie from 1601 to 1608 as his own castle. Kikkawa was a retainer of a vassal of the Shōgun under the Mōri clan. However, this castle was dismantled as per the Ikkoku-ichijo (一国一城, literally, &quot;One Castle Per Province&quot;) order established by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1615. 

After the destruction of the castle, Kikkawa used a part of the old castle as his residential office. The Kikkawa clan held this castle and Iwakuni Han, which was assessed at 30,000 (later 60,000) koku.

A replica of the castle tower built in 1962 now stands high on a hill above the Nishiki River and the Kintai Bridge. The castle was selected to be one of the 100 Great Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.

<text>Dongcheng () is a district of the city of Beijing. It covers the eastern half of Beijing&#x27;s urban core region, including all of the eastern half of the Old City inside of the 2nd Ring Road with the northernmost extent crossing into the area within the 3rd Ring Road. Its area is further subdivided into 17 subdistricts.

Settlement in the area dates back over a millennium. It did not formally become a district of the city until the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911. The name Dongcheng was first given to it in a 1958 reorganization; it has existed in its current form since a 2010 merger with the former Chongwen to its south.

Dongcheng includes many of Beijing&#x27;s major cultural attractions, such as the Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites. More than a quarter of the city&#x27;s Major National Historical and Cultural Sites are inside its boundaries, with a similar percentage of those protected at the municipal level. Tiananmen Square is also in Dongcheng, along with other popular destinations for domestic and international tourists such as the bars and nightlife in the &quot;hutongs&quot; of Nanluoguxiang and the shopping in Wangfujing. Over three-quarters of the district&#x27;s economic activity is in the service sector.

==Geography==
Dongcheng is often described, and depicted on simplified maps, as the eastern half of the area inside the 2nd Ring Road. However, the district boundaries include some areas outside it as well, particularly on the north and east. In the former direction a small projection crosses the 3rd Ring Road. The 2010 merger with Chongwen added some land beyond the Ring Road on the south.

===Boundary===

From Tiananmen at the north end of the eponymous square the district boundary follows West Chang&#x27;an Avenue to Chang Street, where it turns north, taking in Zhongshan Park as it follows the western moat of the Forbidden City. At Wenzhin Street it turns eastward to follow Jingshan Front Street between the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park. It resumes its northward course along Jingshan East Street, turning west along Jingshan Back Street, thus leaving all of Jingshan in Xicheng to the west.

At Di&#x27;anmen Inner Street it turns north again, following the east–west line that formally divided Beijing in the mid-15th century. After a short turn to the west at the Bell and Drum Towers along Gulou West Street, it resumes its northward course along Jiugulou Street, which it follows north for several kilometers, past the 2nd Ring Road to Andeli Street North, where it turns west. At the street&#x27;s end, the edge of Rendinghu Park, it follows the park edge to the northeast.

The boundary turns east at Huangsi Street, following the rear property lines of buildings on the north side. It crosses the street again a block east of Gulou Outer Street, where it follows the northern edge of Liuyin Park. From the park&#x27;s northeastern corner it goes due east to Andingmen Outer Street, where it turns north.

It continues north across the 3rd Ring Road for a kilometer to Jian&#x27;an East Road, where it turns east, just south of Yuan Dadu City Wall Ruins Park. This is the district&#x27;s northernmost section, bordering on Chaoyang. After 500m, it zigzags south, southeast and then west again along local streets to Shenggu Middle Road. There it turns south and crosses the Ring Road again, continuing on Xiaohangzhuang North Street. Another zigzag takes it along Xiaohangzhuang, Xinghua, and Qingniangou roads to Heipingli East Street, where it turns south, to turn east again along Heiplingli North Street.

At Jiaolin Alley it turns south again, following another irregular path through the neighborhoods here to just east of Minwang Hutong. At the river paralleling the Second Ring Road on its north, it turns east briefly to follow that, cross under the Airport Expressway along Xiangheyuan Middle Street. A short section detours north to take in some of the buildings on the north side of Xiangheyuan Road, after which it returns to what is now Xiangheyuan North Street.

Turning southeast along Zuojiazhuang West Street, the boundary turns to follow the north bank of the Landmark River eastward at the Chunxiu Road intersection. The river bends to the east and then southeast, where a short tributary comes in 200 m west of Chunxiu. It follows that back to Chunxiu at its intersection with Dongzhimen Outer Street.

Rejoining Chunxiu, the boundary stays with it for another to Beijing Workers&#x27; Stadium, where it becomes Workers&#x27; Stadium West Road, with Workers Indoor Arena on the east side. At Dongyingfang Hutong, it turns west again. Following Jishikou East Road north for a block, then turning west on Panjiapao Hutong, a brief northward turn at Dongzhong Street brings it back to the Second Ring Road via Fuhua Dasha South Street.

From that point the boundary largely follows the ring road south, with a few diversions to take in all of the exit ramps at the Jianguomen Street interchange and some open land at the Tonghui River to its south. At Longtan Park in the southeast corner of the district, it curves west with the road to form the district&#x27;s southern boundary with Fengtai. Just past the Temple of Heaven Park, in the Yongdingmen area, it leaves the ring road to take in a roughly triangular area to the south that includes the Beijing South railway station at its eastern corner.

It then follows Yongdingmen, Tianqiao, and Qianmen streets due north back to the southern end of Tian&#x27;anmen Square. There it turns west briefly, then goes up the square&#x27;s west road between the China Numismatic Museum and the Great Hall of the People. At the square&#x27;s north end is West Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

===Buildings and geography===

Like most of Beijing, the district is consistently level, with an elevation of above sea level, reflecting the city&#x27;s location on the North China Plain. There are a few significant bodies of water, all lakes in parks—Liuyin Lake in that park and Youth Lake in Qingnianhu Park, both in the district&#x27;s northern portion, and Dragon Lake in Longtan Park at the district&#x27;s southeast corner. On the west central edge is the moat surrounding the Forbidden City. The Nanchang River, heavily channelized from its days as the once-walled city&#x27;s north moat, flows across the district&#x27;s north, with the South Moat paralleling the 2nd Ring Road along its southern boundary. Along the southern edge of the Forbidden City another small stream, the Changpu River, flows above ground for a kilometer.

Much of the district is densely developed, with major streets following a grid plan, while the side streets connecting them are irregular. Temple of Heaven Park is the largest, at , with the Temple of Earth Park in the Hepingli Subdistrict in second. In addition to the parks already mentioned, others of note include Dongdan Park off that street in the central area of the district and Nanguan Park near the northeast corner. Some major arteries also have wide planted median strips. The Russian embassy complex just inside the Ring Road at the northeast corner of the district also has another large planted area, although it is fenced off.

The most significant non-park urban open space in the district is the Tiananmen Square at its west central point. It is a stone-paved pedestrian area with the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes and Zhengyang Gate bracketing its one building, the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. To the square&#x27;s immediate north the Forbidden City complex also has many vast courtyards. At the east end, the Workers&#x27; Gymnasium has some large paved areas and open lawns in its vicinity. There is also a large open plaza in front of the Beijing railway station.

Architecture in the district varies greatly. It ranges in form from the small one and two-story ancient stone houses in the &quot;siheyuan&quot; plan, that line the district&#x27;s many &quot;hutongs&quot;, the narrow, winding lanes that make up many neighborhoods on the side streets, to taller modern office buildings and hotels. Styles include the traditional Chinese architecture of the 15th-century imperial buildings in the Forbidden City and the various temples, the &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; European revival styles in the Legation Quarter to the modern styles of today&#x27;s newest buildings. The district has over a quarter of Beijing&#x27;s Major National Historical and Cultural Sites, and a similar portion of its municipal-level heritage listings. Two of those, the Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven, are further inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
==History==

Dongcheng&#x27;s history dates back over a millennium, long predating the city&#x27;s current boundaries. Settlement of the area between the city&#x27;s inner and outer walls began during the Liao dynasty in the 10th century C.E., when small hamlets began to form outside the northeastern corner of what was then the city (now the Forbidden City). Growth continued through the Jin dynasty, which succeeded the Liao in the 12th century.

Under the Jin, the area first became known as the northeastern part of the capital, then known as Zhongdu. When Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty later in the century, he rebuilt the city and renamed it Dadu. As part of that project, the future Dongcheng district&#x27;s boundaries were first officially drawn, although they were different from today&#x27;s.

The Yongle emperor, Zhu Di, third of the Ming dynasty, took the throne at the beginning of the 15th century. He built the present-day Forbidden City, now part of Dongcheng, as his palace inside the walls of the original city. Outside it, Dongcheng had 15 lanes at that time, the beginnings of its many &quot;hutong&quot;s.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the area began to become a desirable residence for both government officials and the merchants who sold to them, due to its proximity to the palace. They built themselves the &quot;siheyuan&quot; courtyard-style houses that remain a valued part of the district&#x27;s cultural heritage. The Qings stationed four divisions of their army in the district, which was officially at the time part of Daxing County (now a district south of the city).

The overthrow of the Qings and the establishment of the Republic of China in the wake of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 led to the area northeast of the Forbidden City being opened to the public for the first time. Under the government of the new Republic of China, the districts of Beijing were reorganized. Today&#x27;s Dongcheng was known as the inner first and inner third districts.

Four decades later, the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the People&#x27;s Republic of China displacing the Republic as the sovereign government of mainland China. This had two effects on Dongcheng. First, the two districts in the area were renamed Dongsi and Dongdan, corresponding to streets that still exist in the northern and central portions of the district, in 1952; six years later the two were merged and renamed Dongcheng. That district was then merged with the Chongwen District to its south in 2010.

Secondly, many of the wealthy &quot;siheyuan&quot; residents fled to Taiwan or elsewhere in anticipation of the Communist victory and the likely expropriation of their property; those who remained or did not leave in time indeed suffered that fate. The new government subdivided many of the houses in order to deliver on its promise of better housing for the working class, and the neighborhood culture of the &quot;hutong&quot;s was sustained. However, the increased wealth in China created by the economic reforms of the late 20th century, following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, put pressure on Beijing&#x27;s city government to demolish &quot;hutong&quot;s in Dongcheng and elsewhere. They were perceived as architecturally undistinguished substandard slums that could not be fully modernized, to be replaced by urban renewal projects such as the Oriental Plaza mall complex that would impress visitors to the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Often many poorer residents found themselves displaced, unable to afford the luxury housing that replaced their demolished homes. In the 1990s it was estimated that 40% of Beijing&#x27;s Old City, which includes Dongcheng, had been demolished; some predictions suggest that if demolition continues at its current pace, eventually 90% of the Old City will be gone. Efforts by preservationists to protect the hutongs were only partly successful, and developers and officials often ignored them. A battle over the city&#x27;s proposed redevelopment of South Chizi Street, alongside the Forbidden City&#x27;s southeast corner, at first attracted attention due to its high-visibility location, but ultimately only nine of over 200 &quot;siheyuan&quot;s in the blocks east of the street escaped demolition. They have been replaced by architecturally sympathetic new construction that is among the most expensive housing in the city.

==Government==

Dongcheng is run by several committees. The District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is its local organization. The District People&#x27;s Congress is responsible for most major decisions, as well as implementing national and local laws and regulations. Its members, all appointed by the CCP, elect their leadership and local officials. The People&#x27;s Government, composed of several local commissions, makes local laws and enforces administrative policy. Lastly, the district committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference serves an advisory function. All four committees are headed by chairs, appointed by the CCP to five-year terms.

While most of China&#x27;s major government bodies are headquartered in the neighboring Xicheng District, there are a hundred lesser ones in offices throughout Dongcheng. Two major agencies in the district are the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which occupies a large building on Dongsi Street, and the China Maritime Safety Administration, on Jianguomen Inner Avenue. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau is also headquartered in Dongcheng, as is the China International Development Cooperation Agency (China Aid).

==Economy==

In 2017, the regional GDP of the district was 392.07 billion yuan, with GDP per capita at 321.4 thousand yuan.

Owing to its many tourist attractions, much of Dongcheng&#x27;s economy is in the service sector, which in 2001 accounted for 88% of the district&#x27;s share of China&#x27;s gross domestic product. Foreign direct investment at that time was estimated to be US$247.6 million, and rising. Dongcheng is home to some of Beijing&#x27;s most prestigious hotels, like the Beijing Hotel complex and the nearby Grand Hyatt on East Chang&#x27;an Avenue near Tiananmen Square. Near those hotels are the shopping opportunities of the Malls at Oriental Plaza, once Asia&#x27;s largest, and the Wangfujing pedestrian mall, a big draw for domestic tourists. Further to the north younger Beijingers and foreigners often visit the &quot;hutong&quot;s of Nanluogoxiang, east of the Bell and Drum Towers, for its bar and nightlife offerings.

While most of Beijing&#x27;s major corporate buildings are located in the city&#x27;s central business district in the Chaoyang District to Dongcheng&#x27;s north and east, some are within the district. China National Petroleum Corporation and subsidiary PetroChina share one headquarters facility just inside the district at the Chaoyangmen intersection along the 2nd Ring Road. Air Koryo has an office in the Swissôtel Beijing in Dongcheng District.

Beijing&#x27;s current master plan designates Dongcheng as one of the city&#x27;s four core zones. To enhance the district&#x27;s combination of commercial and cultural attractions, it calls for giving priority to service and high-tech industries within it. Three areas in particular are singled out for attention—Wangfujing, the eastern portion of the 2nd Ring Road, and the High Technology Park near the Lama Temple at Yonghegong Road and the Ring Road. The plan also calls for the &quot;preservation of the city&#x27;s historic landscape and renovation of dilapidated houses.&quot; Tax credits are available to eligible businesses that generate at least a half a million renminbi in contributions in their first years of operation in the district.

==Administrative divisions==
The district contains 17 subdistricts:

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===

Throughout Dongcheng are many of Beijing&#x27;s public schools. Some of its high schools have been added to the city&#x27;s list of beacon high schools, those that consistently maintain high standards. Among them are Beijing No. 166 High School on Tongfu Alley just off Dengshikou Street, Beijing Huiwen Middle School on Peixin Street in the former Chongwen District and Beijing No. 5 High School on Xiguan Hutong east of Nanluogoxiang. Another secondary institution of note, Beijing Jingshan School, is also located on Dengshikou Road. on Chaoyangmen Inner Street.

Beijing No. 25 Middle School has a dual Chinese-Canadian diploma program.

The Beijing Dongcheng Huimin Elementary School () serves the local Hui population.

===Post-secondary schools===
From its founding in the early 20th century to the Japanese occupation of eastern China in 1937, Peking University was housed in the Belgian-designed brick &quot;Honglou&quot; () or &quot;Red House&quot;, at Wusi and Beiheyan streets. Mao Zedong worked in the library there, where he was among the leaders of the May Fourth Movement that lent its name to Wusi Street, an experience that later led him to help found the CCP. The university moved out to a larger campus in the Haidian District when Mao established the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, and the Honglou is now a museum.
Shortly after the university moved, Mao established the Central Academy of Drama, the only institution of higher education currently in the district. Many accomplished Chinese actors have graduated from it, and it is considered one of the best drama schools in China, East Asia and Asia. It is located on Dongmianhua Hutong, a short distance west of Nanluoguxiang.

<text>The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale is an anarchist spy fiction novel by Polish-British author Joseph Conrad, first published on 12 September 1907. The story is set in Soho, London in 1886 and deals with Mr. Adolf Verloc and his work as a spy for an unnamed country (presumably Russia). &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; is one of Conrad&#x27;s later political novels in which he moved away from his former tales of seafaring. The novel is dedicated to H. G. Wells and deals broadly with anarchism, espionage, and terrorism. It also deals with exploitation of the vulnerable in Verloc&#x27;s relationship with his brother-in-law Stevie, who has an intellectual disability. Conrad’s gloomy portrait of London depicted in the novel was influenced by Charles Dickens’ &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

The novel was modified as a stage play by Conrad himself and has since been adapted for film, TV, radio and opera.

Because of its terrorism theme, it was one of the three works of literature most cited in the American media two weeks after the September 11 attacks.

==Plot summary==
Set in Soho, London in 1886, the novel follows the life of Adolf Verloc, a secret agent. Verloc is also a businessman who owns a shop which sells pornographic material, contraceptives and bric-a-brac. He lives with his wife Winnie, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie. Stevie has a mental disability, possibly autism, which causes him to be excitable; his sister, Verloc&#x27;s wife, attends to him, treating him more as a son than as a brother. Verloc&#x27;s friends are a group of anarchists of which Comrade Ossipon, Michaelis, and &quot;The Professor&quot; are the most prominent. Although largely ineffectual as terrorists, their actions are known to the police. The group produces anarchist literature in the form of pamphlets entitled &quot;F.P.&quot;, an acronym for &quot;The Future of the Proletariat&quot;.

The novel begins in Verloc&#x27;s home, as he and his wife discuss the trivialities of everyday life, which introduces the reader to Verloc&#x27;s family. Soon after, Verloc leaves to meet Mr Vladimir, the new First Secretary in the embassy of a foreign country, for whom he works as an agent provocateur. Vladimir informs Verloc that from reviewing his service history he is far from an exemplary model of a secret agent and, to redeem himself, must carry out an operation – the destruction of Greenwich Observatory by a bomb. Vladimir explains that Britain&#x27;s lax attitude to anarchism endangers his own country, and he reasons that an attack on &#x27;science&#x27;, the current vogue amongst the public, will provide the necessary outrage for suppression. Verloc later meets his friends, who discuss politics and law, and the notion of a communist revolution. Unbeknownst to the group, Stevie, Verloc&#x27;s brother-in-law, overhears the conversation, which greatly disturbs him.

The novel flashes forward to after the bombing has taken place. Comrade Ossipon meets The Professor, who discusses having given explosives to Verloc. The Professor describes the nature of the bomb he carries in his coat at all times: it allows him to press a button which will kill him and those nearest to him in twenty seconds. After The Professor leaves the meeting, he stumbles into Chief Inspector Heat, a policeman investigating a recent explosion at Greenwich, where one man was killed. Heat informs The Professor that he is not a suspect in the case, but that he is being monitored due to his terrorist inclinations and anarchist background. Heat suspects Michaelis. Knowing that Michaelis has recently moved to the countryside to write a book, the Chief Inspector informs the Assistant Commissioner that he has a contact, Verloc, who may be able to assist in the case. The Assistant Commissioner shares some of the same high society acquaintances with Michaelis and is chiefly motivated by finding the extent of Michaelis&#x27;s involvement in order to assess any possible embarrassment to his connections. He later speaks to his superior, Sir Ethelred, about his intentions to solve the case alone, rather than rely on the effort of Chief Inspector Heat.

The novel flashes back to before the explosion, taking the perspective of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Winnie&#x27;s mother informs the family that she intends to move out of the house. The move is motivated largely by a desire to avoid straining Mr. Verloc’s kindness. Winnie&#x27;s mother and Stevie use a hansom driven by a man with a hook for a hand. The driver&#x27;s tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs Verloc must calm him. On Verloc&#x27;s return from a business trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees to go for a walk with Stevie. After this walk, Winnie notes that her husband&#x27;s relationship with her brother has improved. Verloc tells his wife that he has taken Stevie to go and visit Michaelis, and that Stevie would stay with him in the countryside for a few days.

As Verloc is talking to his wife about the possibility of emigrating to the continent, he is paid a visit by the Assistant Commissioner. Shortly thereafter, Chief Inspector Heat arrives to speak with Verloc, without knowing that the Assistant Commissioner had left with Verloc earlier that evening. The Chief Inspector tells Winnie that he had recovered an overcoat at the scene of the bombing which had the shop&#x27;s address written on a label. Winnie confirms that it was Stevie&#x27;s overcoat, and that she had written the address. On Verloc&#x27;s return, he realises that his wife knows that his bomb killed her brother, and confesses what truly happened. A stunned Winnie, in her anguish, fatally stabs her husband.

After the murder, Winnie flees her home, where she chances upon Comrade Ossipon, and begs him to help her. Ossipon assists her while confessing romantic feelings but secretly with a view to possess Mr Verloc&#x27;s bank account savings. They plan to run away and he aids her in taking a boat to the continent. However, her instability and the revelation of Verloc&#x27;s murder increasingly worry him, and he abandons her, taking Mr Verloc&#x27;s savings with him. He later discovers in a newspaper that a woman matching Winnie&#x27;s description disappeared from the ferry, leaving behind her wedding ring before drowning herself in the English Channel.

==Characters==
* Adolf Verloc: a secret agent who owns a shop in Soho in London. His primary characteristic, as described by Conrad, is indolence. He has been employed by an unnamed embassy to spy on revolutionary groups, which then orders him to instigate a terrorist act against the Greenwich Observatory. Their belief is that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to act more forcibly against émigré socialist and anarchist activists. He is part of an anarchist organisation that creates pamphlets under the heading &quot;The Future of the Proletariat&quot;. He is married to Winnie, and lives with his wife, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie.
* Winifred &quot;Winnie&quot; Verloc: Verloc&#x27;s wife. She cares deeply for her brother Stevie, who has the mental age of a young child. Of working class origins, her father was the owner of a pub. She is younger than her husband and married him not for love but to provide a home for her mother and brother. A loyal wife, she is disturbed upon learning of the death of her brother due to her husband&#x27;s plotting, and kills him with a knife in the heart. She dies, presumably by drowning herself to avoid the gallows.
* Stevie: Winnie&#x27;s brother has the mental age of a young child. He is sensitive and is disturbed by notions of violence or hardship. His sister cares for him, and Stevie passes most of his time drawing numerous circles on pieces of paper. Verloc, exploiting both Stevie&#x27;s childlike simplicity and his outrage at suffering, employs him to carry out the bombing of Greenwich Observatory. Stevie stumbles and the bomb explodes prematurely, killing him.
* Winnie Verloc&#x27;s mother: old and infirm, Winnie&#x27;s mother leaves the household to live in an almshouse, believing that two disabled people (herself and Stevie) are too much for Mr Verloc&#x27;s generosity. The widow of a publican, she spent most of her life working hard in her husband&#x27;s pub and believes Mr Verloc to be a gentleman because she thinks he resembles patrons of business houses (pubs with higher prices, consequently frequented by the upper classes).
* Chief Inspector Heat: a policeman who is dealing with the explosion at Greenwich. An astute, practical man who uses a clue found at the scene of the crime to trace events back to Verloc&#x27;s home. Although he informs his superior what he is planning to do with regards to the case, he is initially not aware that the Assistant Commissioner is acting without his knowledge. Heat knew Verloc before the bombing as Verloc had supplied information to Heat through the embassy. Heat despises anarchists, whom he regards as amateurs, as opposed to burglars, whom he regards as professionals.
* The Assistant Commissioner: of a higher rank than the Chief Inspector, he uses the knowledge gained from Heat to pursue matters personally, for reasons of his own. The Assistant Commissioner is married to a lady with influential connections. He informs his superior, Sir Ethelred, of his intentions, and tracks down Verloc before Heat can.
* Sir Ethelred: a secretary of state (Home Secretary), to whom the Assistant Commissioner reports. At the time of the bombing he is busy trying to pass a bill regarding the nationalisation of fisheries through the House of Commons against strong opposition. He is briefed by the Assistant Commissioner throughout the novel and often admonishes him not to go into detail.
* Mr Vladimir: First Secretary of the embassy of an unnamed country. Though his name might suggest that this is the Russian embassy, the name of the previous first secretary, Baron Stott-Wartenheim, is Germanic, as is that of Privy Councillor Wurmt, another official of this embassy. There is also the suggestion that Vladimir is not from Europe but Central Asia. Vladimir thinks that the &#x27;English&#x27; police are far too soft on émigré socialists and anarchists, who are a real problem in his home country. He orders Verloc to instigate a terrorist act, hoping that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to adopt repressive measures.
* Michaelis: a member of Verloc&#x27;s group, and another anarchist. The most philosophical member of the group.
* Comrade Alexander Ossipon: an ex-medical student, anarchist and member of Verloc&#x27;s group. He survives on the savings of women he seduces, mostly working-class women. He is influenced by the theories on degeneracy of Cesare Lombroso. After Verloc&#x27;s murder he initially helps, but afterwards abandons Winnie, leaving her penniless on a train. He is later disturbed when he reads of her suicide and wonders if he will be able to seduce a woman again.
* Karl Yundt: a member of Verloc&#x27;s group, commonly referred to as an &quot;old terrorist&quot;.
* The Professor: another anarchist, who specializes in explosives. The Professor carries a flask of explosives in his coat, which can be detonated within twenty seconds of him squeezing an India rubber ball in his pocket. The police know this and keep their distance. The most nihilistic member of the anarchists, the Professor feels oppressed and disgusted by the rest of humanity and has particular contempt for the weak, whom he blames for all his troubles. He dreams of a world where the weak are freely exterminated so that the strong (himself) can thrive. He supplies to Verloc the bomb that kills Stevie. (The Professor also appears as a character in Conrad&#x27;s short story &quot;The Informer.&quot;)

==Background: Greenwich Bombing of 1894==

Conrad&#x27;s character Stevie is based on the French anarchist Martial Bourdin who died gruesomely when the explosives he carried detonated prematurely. Bourdin&#x27;s motives remain a mystery as does his intended target, which may have been the Greenwich Observatory. In the 1920 Author&#x27;s Note to the novel, Conrad recalls a discussion with Ford Madox Ford about the bombing:
==Major themes==
===Terrorism and anarchism===
Terrorism and anarchism are intrinsic aspects of the novel, and are central to the plot. Verloc is employed by an agency which requires him to orchestrate terrorist activities, and several of the characters deal with terrorism in some way: Verloc&#x27;s friends are all interested in an anarchistic political revolution, and the police are investigating anarchist motives behind the bombing of Greenwich.

The novel was written at a time when terrorist activity was increasing. There had been numerous dynamite attacks in both Europe and the US, as well as several assassinations of heads of state. Conrad also drew upon two persons specifically: Mikhail Bakunin and Prince Peter Kropotkin. Conrad used these two men in his &quot;portrayal of the novel&#x27;s anarchists&quot;. However, according to Conrad&#x27;s Author&#x27;s Note, only one character was a true anarchist: Winnie Verloc. In &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;, she is &quot;the only character who performs a serious act of violence against another&quot;, despite the &quot;F.P.&quot;&#x27;s intentions of radical change, and The Professor&#x27;s inclination to keep a bomb on his person.

Critics have analysed the role of terrorism in the novel. Patrick Reilly calls the novel &quot;a terrorist text as well as a text about terrorism&quot; due to Conrad&#x27;s manipulation of chronology to allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. The morality which is implicit in these acts of terrorism has also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently thinks so, the issue is not clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.

===Politics===
The role of politics is paramount in the novel, as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The role of politics is seen in several places in the novel: in the revolutionary ideas of the &quot;F.P.&quot;; in the characters&#x27; personal beliefs; and in Verloc&#x27;s own private life. Conrad&#x27;s depiction of anarchism has an &quot;enduring political relevance&quot;, although the focus is now largely concerned with the terrorist aspects that this entails. The discussions of the &quot;F.P.&quot; are expositions on the role of anarchism and its relation to contemporary life. The threat of these thoughts is evident, as Chief Inspector Heat knows &quot;F.P.&quot; members because of their anarchist views. Moreover, Michaelis&#x27; actions are monitored by the police to such an extent that he must notify the police station that he is moving to the country.

The plot to destroy Greenwich is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing &quot;must be purely destructive&quot; and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion &quot;should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation.&quot; However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency.

Some critics, such as Fredrick R Karl, think that the main political phenomenon in this novel is the modern age, as symbolised by the teeming, pullulating foggy streets of London (most notably in the cab ride taken by Winnie Verloc and Stevie). This modern age distorts everything, including politics (Verloc is motivated by the need to keep his remunerative position, the Professor to some extent by pride); the family (symbolised by the Verloc household, in which all roles are distorted, with the husband being like a father to the wife, who is like a mother to her brother); even the human body (Michaelis and Verloc are hugely obese, while the Professor and Yundt are unusually thin). This extended metaphor, using London as a centre of darkness much like Kurtz&#x27;s headquarters in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, presents &quot;a dark vision of moral and spiritual inertia&quot; and a condemnation of those who, like Mrs Verloc, think it a mistake to think too deeply.

==Literary significance and reception==
Initially, the novel fared poorly in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling only 3,076 copies between 1907 and 1914. The book fared slightly better in Britain, yet no more than 6,500 copies were printed before 1914. Although sales increased after 1914, it never sold more than modestly during Conrad&#x27;s life. It was published to favourable reviews, most agreeing with the view of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; that it &quot;increase[d] Conrad&#x27;s reputation, already of the highest&quot;. However, there were detractors who criticised the novel&#x27;s &quot;unpleasant characters and subject&quot;. &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine called the story &quot;indecent&quot; and criticised Conrad&#x27;s &quot;often dense and elliptical style&quot;.

&quot;The Secret Agent&quot; has come to be considered one of Conrad&#x27;s finest novels. &quot;The Independent&quot; calls it &quot;[o]ne of Conrad&#x27;s great city novels&quot; whilst &quot;The New York Times&quot; insists that it is &quot;the most brilliant novelistic study of terrorism&quot;. &quot;The Pequod&quot; called the book “one of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s best books,” and rated the book a 9.5 out of 10.0.” In a 2016 review, &quot;The National Review&quot; said the book “may be the first great novel of global terrorism.”

==Influence on Ted Kaczynski==
&quot;The Secret Agent&quot; influenced Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber. He was a great fan and as an adolescent kept a copy at his bedside. He identified strongly with the character of &quot;The Professor&quot; and advised his family to read &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; to understand the character with whom he felt such an affinity. Don Foster, the literary attributionist who assisted the FBI, said that Kaczynski &quot;seem[ed] to have felt that his family could not understand him without reading Conrad&quot;.

Kaczynski&#x27;s idolisation of the character was due to the personality traits that they shared: disaffection, hostility toward the world, and being an aspiring anarchist. However, it did not stop at mere idolisation. Kaczynski used &quot;The Professor&quot; as a source of inspiration, and &quot;fabricated sixteen exploding packages that detonated in various locations&quot;. After his capture, Kaczynski revealed to FBI agents that he had read the novel a dozen times, and had sometimes used &quot;Conrad&quot; as an alias. It was discovered that Kaczynski had used various formulations of Conrad&#x27;s name – Conrad, Konrad, and Korzeniowski, Conrad&#x27;s original surname – to sign himself into several hotels in Sacramento. As in his youth, Kaczynski retained a copy of &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;, and kept it with him while living as a recluse in a hut in Montana.

<doc id="839391" wikidata="Q7353497" url="?curid=839391" title="Robson Arms">
<text>Robson Arms is a Canadian television series that began airing on CTV on June 17, 2005, and ended on June 30, 2008. &quot;Robson Arms&quot; is a co-production between Vancouver-based Omni Film Productions Limited and Halifax&#x27;s Creative Atlantic Communications.

The show is a comedy-drama (dramedy) anthology organized around the Robson Arms, an apartment building in Vancouver, at the fictional address of 951 Pendrell Street. Each of the show&#x27;s episodes focuses principally on a different tenant of the building, although the core cast members interact in minor roles throughout the series. In each episode, the Troubadours comment on the storyline through song.

The show was created to fulfill a licensing requirement of CTV&#x27;s Vancouver station, CIVT, which originally promised, as an independent station, to produce 20 episodes of an anthology series entitled &quot;The Storytellers&quot;. Only ten such episodes were produced. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) did not agree that CIVT&#x27;s new network programming supplanted this commitment and asked the station to fulfill its promise. CTV believed the anthology would be more successful as a series with common characters, and &quot;Robson Arms&quot; was the result.

Two of the show&#x27;s regular cast members, Gabrielle Miller and Fred Ewanuick, appeared in this series concurrent with their continuing roles in another CTV production, &quot;Corner Gas&quot;.

The series currently airs in reruns on CTV&#x27;s secondary CTV Two system.

== Cast and characters ==
The season(s) during which each actor has been included in the main cast are marked in black. White square means the actor doesn&#x27;t appear in that season at all.

== Robson Arms, the Building ==

The structure used as the apartment building is not located in Vancouver&#x27;s West End, but rather is located at 951 Boundary Road on the east side of the City of Vancouver. It is called Taylor Manor, and is on the City of Vancouver&#x27;s historic building registry. The skyscraper skyline behind the building is superimposed to make it look like it is located in Vancouver&#x27;s West End.
