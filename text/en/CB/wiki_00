<text>Hazel is a single-panel cartoon series by Ted Key about a live-in maid who works for a middle-class family. Launched in 1943, &quot;Hazel&quot; ended September 29, 2018.

== Publication history ==
The character of Hazel came to Key in 1943 in a dream. He drew it the next morning and sent to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, where it quickly became a popular series.

&quot;Hazel&quot; ran weekly in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; until the magazine ceased publication in 1969, after which the cartoon was picked up for daily newspaper syndication by King Features Syndicate, starting on June 16, 1969. Key continued to draw &quot;Hazel&quot; until his retirement in 1993; he died in May 2008. 

In 2008, King Features was reprinting &quot;Hazel&quot; panels in more than 50 newspapers.

==Characters==
* Hazel, the live-in maid to the Baxter family, also serving as nanny to the children.
* George Baxter, ostensible head of the household.
* Dorothy Baxter, George&#x27;s wife.
* Harold Baxter, the son of George and Dorothy.
* Katie Baxter, the Baxters&#x27; adopted younger child.
* Smiley the dog.
* Mostly the cat.
* Two Ton, another cat, named for its size.

In 2008, the cartoonist&#x27;s son, Peter Key, talked about the origin of the character, &quot;Like a lot of creative people, he kept a notepad near his bedside. He had a dream about a maid who took a message, but she screwed it up completely. When he looked at the idea the next day, he thought it was good and sold it to &quot;The Post&quot;.&quot; 

Shortly afterward, the wry and bossy household maid was given the name Hazel, along with employment at the Baxter household. Peter Key recalled, &quot;He picked the name Hazel out of the air, but there was an editor at &quot;The Post&quot; who had a sister named Hazel. She thought her brother came up with the name, and she didn’t speak to him for two years.&quot;

== Books ==
Key&#x27;s cartoons were reprinted in a series of books, including &quot;Here&#x27;s Hazel&quot; and &quot;All Hazel&quot;. The first in the series, &quot;Hazel&quot;, was published by E. P. Dutton in 1946, and sold 500,000 copies. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; commented:
:Cartoons from the next to last page of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, in which Hazel, a slightly dimmed jewel of a domestic, puts her employers and their friends through their paces with no hesitation about taking the center of the stage. Joining in their games, their parties, their conversations, their arguments, court of appeal for household decisions, intimidating the unwary, demanding-and grabbing-her rights, Hazel is certainly the least inhibited person on paper today. You may start off disliking her and her omnipresence in the household, but sooner or later one of her cracks will get you—and you&#x27;ll be sold.

==Television==

Key adapted his cartoon series into the television show &quot;Hazel&quot;, starring Shirley Booth, who won two Emmy Awards portraying the titular maid. It ran from 1961 to 1965 on NBC; for its final 1965-66 season, the show switched to CBS.

==Awards==
Key won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1977 for &quot;Hazel&quot;.

<text>William Percy French (1 May 1854 – 24 January 1920) was an Irish songwriter, author, poet, entertainer and painter.

== Life ==
French was born at Clooneyquinn House, near Tulsk, County Roscommon, the son of an Anglo-Irish landlord, Christopher French, and Susan Emma French (née Percy). He was the third of nine children. His younger sister, Emily later Emily de Burgh Daly was also a writer.

He was educated in England at Kirk Langley and Windermere College before going to Foyle College in Derry and wrote his first successful song while studying at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in 1877 for a smoking concert. The song, &quot;Abdul Abulbul Amir&quot;, was published in 200 copies for £5 and French sold each copy for 2s6d, making a small fortune. However, he fatally omitted to register the copyright on the song and lost all the subsequent income from the royalties as it was re-published without his name. The royalties were restored to his widow and daughters after his death. The song later became hugely popular and was falsely claimed by other authors.

Although he lost copyright, French always claimed authorship and did so on the sleeve of his song &quot;Slattery&#x27;s Mounted Fut&quot; (1889) and in every issue of the weekly &quot;The Jarvey&quot;. Brendan O&#x27;Dowda claimed to have discovered, via the popularity of versions of the song at the American military academies in the 1980s, that French had written the lyrics while at Trinity College. He claimed responsibility for the restoration of the royalties in the 1980s. Ettie French gives a different account of how the royalties were restored in her book &quot;Willie&quot; (1995) about her father&#x27;s life. She claimed the royalties were restored in the 1940s to the family. The ballad resembles a comic opera spoof. &quot;Pot Skivers&quot; were the chambermaids at the college, thus Ivan &quot;Potschjinski&quot; Skivar would be a less than noble prince, and as Bulbul is an Arabic dialectic name of the nightingale, Abdul was thus a foppish &quot;nightingale&quot; amir (prince). When French died, not at all wealthy, he was owed a fortune in unpaid royalties. A windfall in royalties came to his family in the 1940s from &quot;Abdullah Abulbul Ameer&quot; and &quot;Phil the Fluter&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

French graduated from TCD first being conferred with a BA degree in 1885 as a civil engineer in 1880 and after a stint as an apprentice engineer on the Midlands Railway with fellow entertainer Charles Mansergh (later Charles Manners of the Moody-Manners Opera Company) French joined the Board of Works in County Cavan as an Inspector of Drains in 1883. While in Trinity French won five out of six watercolour prizes and he became a member of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1876. It is said that he wrote his best songs during his Cavan period. He also painted copiously and established a sketching club and a comic troupe The Kinnepottle Komics in Cavan. During this period, he considered art to be his true vocation. In fact, when he became well-known later in his life, his paintings from his time as a civil engineer became fashionable and sought after. The volcano Krakatoa erupted in 1883 while French was in Cavan, and the particles of volcanic ash caused dramatic sunsets all over the world. French painted some of his finest landscapes in this period as he captured the spectacular skies. French exhibited his pictures in the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) and sometimes gave them short lyrical poems for titles, such as &quot;Only the sullen seas that flow/ And ebb forever more,/ But tarry awhile sad heart and, lo!/ A light on that lonely shore&quot;.

RJ Mecredy

When the Board of Works reduced its staff around 1888, French turned to journalism as the editor of &quot;The Jarvey&quot;, a weekly comic paper which was set up by RJ Mecredy. It ran for two years and contains 1,664 pages. French was an enthusiastic cyclist, who cycled all over the country with his art materials stopping to sketch and paint. He was good friends with &quot;Arjay&quot; Mecredy, and he contributed to The Irish Cyclist for 34 years. When Mecredy went on holiday, he asked French to stand in for him as editor of &quot;The Irish Cyclist&quot; magazine. French&#x27;s fey sense of humour caused him to make facetious replies to the letters to the editor, and Mecredy returned to a storm of raging withdrawals of subscriptions. He offered to subvent French in a humorous magazine.

When &quot;The Jarvey&quot; failed, French&#x27;s long and successful career as a songwriter and entertainer began. He had lived by the canal in Dublin at 35 Mespil Road before going to London in 1890. He famously wrote to his friends when he moved there: &quot;We have come to live by the canal, do drop in&quot;. A granite seat was erected in 1988 on the canal near his home, dedicated to French. It was sponsored by the Oriel Gallery and bears another witticism of French&#x27;s: &quot;Remember me is all I ask, / And if that memory proves a task, forget&quot;.

French is mentioned twice by name in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and his death in Liverpool is recorded on page 73-74 of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as the passing of the giant Finn-Finnegan. His song &#x27;Phil the Fluter&#x27;s Ball&#x27; is referenced 26 times in the book and several other songs.

French was married twice. His first wife, Ethel Armitage-Moore contributed a regular weekly gossip and fashion column to The Jarvey as well as exceptionally beautiful drawings. She died a day after their first wedding anniversary on 29 June 1891 of complications connected to maternal sepsis and her baby daughter, also called Ethel, died some weeks later. She is buried in Mount Jerome cemetery and the baby is buried in the grounds of Elphin Cathedral. In November 1894 French&#x27;s second wife became Helen Sheldon from Warwickshire and they had three daughters. They lived from 1894 to 1900 at 35 Mespil Road and moved to St John&#x27;s Wood London in 1900.

French is renowned today for composing and singing comic songs and gained considerable distinction with such songs as &quot;Phil the Fluther&#x27;s Ball&quot;, &quot;Slattery&#x27;s Mounted Foot&quot;, and &quot;The Mountains of Mourne&quot; (this last was one of several written with his friend, stage partner and fellow composer, Houston Collisson). In his professional stage career his shows included numerous nursery rhymes and an array od comic stage sketches, the most famous of which were &quot;How Napoleon Failed to Set Fire to the Thames&quot;, &quot;Doomed to the Dustbin&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Forgot He Was Dead&quot;. &quot;The Mountains of Mourne&quot; was set to the same air as Thomas Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bendmeer&#x27;s Stream&quot; which, in turn, was adapted from the old Irish Air &quot;Carraigdhoun&quot;. French also wrote many sketches and amusing parodic recetations, the most famous of which is &quot;The Queen&#x27;s After-Dinner Speech&quot;, written on the occasion of Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit to Dublin in 1900, in which French drolly suggests &quot;There&#x27;s a slate off Willie Yeats&quot;. In addition, he wrote several poems, some he called &quot;poems of pathos&quot;. Many of his poems and songs are on the theme of emigration. He remained a regular contributor to &quot;The Irish Cyclist&quot;, a weekly journal until his death and there as in &quot;The Jarvey&quot; his many parodies are to be found not least numerous parodies of Thomas Moore and Gilbert and Sullivan.

&quot;Are Ye Right There Michael&quot;, a song ridiculing the state of the rail system in rural County Clare caused such embarrassment to the rail company that – according to a persistent local legend – it led to a libel action against French. According to the story, French arrived late at the court, and when questioned by the judge he responded &quot;Your honour, I travelled by the West Clare Railway&quot;, resulting in the case being thrown out.

In January 1920, when he was 65 years old, French became ill while performing in Glasgow. He died from pneumonia in Formby, in the dioceses of Liverpool, England at the home of his cousin, Canon Richardson of Green Lea, College Avenue, on 24 January 1920. His grave is in the churchyard of St Luke&#x27;s Church, Formby, Merseyside.

=== Memorials ===
In 1988, The Oriel Gallery sponsored a seat erected by the OPW opposite 35 Mespil Road, on the canal, Dublin. French lived there from 1894 to 1900 with his second wife and family. When he moved there, he sent out a communication to his friend: &#x27;We have come to live by the canal, Do drop in!&#x27;

A sculpture of a park bench and plaque depicting his likeness by Brid Ni Rinn was installed on the spot where French was inspired to write &quot;The Mountains of Mourne&quot; in Red Island Park, Skerries, County Dublin, in 2008.

A statue of French sitting on a park bench in the town centre of Ballyjamesduff honours him and his song &quot;Come Back, Paddy Reilly, to Ballyjamesduff&quot;.

In March 2020, a memorial to French was unveiled in Newcastle, County Down, at the site of the Slieve Donard Hotel at the foot of the Mountains of Mourne, to mark the centenary of his death.

== Watercolours by Percy French and the Oriel Gallery ==
Artworks by French have increased in value. On 20 September 2005, the Percy French watercolour landscape &quot;Where ever I go my heart turns back to the County Mayo&quot; was sold by Dublin auctioneers Whyte&#x27;s for a then-record price of €44,000. It is also known as &quot;The Iveagh Percy French&quot; as it came from the Guinness family collection. The story goes that the purchaser had &quot;buyer&#x27;s remorse&quot;, and the painting was purchased immediately by a gallerist. Some ten days after this auction, the Apollo Gallery sold this iconic painting on to an American collector for €65,000.

Oliver Nulty (d. 2005) established the Oriel Gallery in Clare Street, Dublin in 1868, which opened with a Percy French and George Russell exhibition. Nulty promoted French from the day he opened the gallery in 1968 and mounted at least 15 solo exhibitions of French and several group shows featuring French, one opened by Peter Ustinov. Nulty had been a collector for years before opening a gallery but he had a particularly fondness for French as his parents had met French in London in 1913 when they attended one of his matinees and met him afterwards. Nulty noticed that Irish visual art was neglected. He once witnessed that a George Russel had only been sold when a coal scuttle was thrown into the lot which sold for 2/6. As well as mounting several solo exhibitions of French&#x27;s paintings he published several catalogues of French&#x27;s watercolours. French&#x27;s daughters, Joan and Ettie were regular visitors to the Oriel Gallery from the early 1970s and the gallery possesses their letters to Oliver. Peter Ustinov opened the 1986 French exhibition in the Oriel to a thronged audience.

French&#x27;s archive currently resides in the North Down Museum, Bangor, County Down where researchers are welcome to view material by appointment with the museum.

<text>Annualized failure rate (AFR) gives the estimated probability that a device or component will fail during a full year of use. It is a relation between the mean time between failure (MTBF) and the hours that a number of devices are run per year. AFR is estimated from a sample of like components—AFR and MTBF as given by vendors are population statistics that can not predict the behaviour of an individual unit.

==Hard disk drives==
For example, AFR is used to characterize the reliability of hard disk drives.

The relationship between AFR and MTBF (in hours) is:
:formula_1

This equation assumes that the device or component is powered on for the full 8766 hours of a year, and gives the estimated fraction of an original sample of devices or components that will fail in one year, or, equivalently, 1 − AFR is the fraction of devices or components that will show no failures over a year. It is based on an exponential failure distribution (see failure rate for a full derivation).
Note: Some manufacturers count a year as 8760 hours.

This ratio can be approximated by, assuming a small AFR,
:formula_2

For example, a common specification for PATA and SATA drives may be an MTBF of 300,000 hours, giving an approximate theoretical 2.92% annualized failure rate i.e. a 2.92% chance that a given drive will fail during a year of use.

The AFR for a drive is derived from time-to-fail data from a reliability-demonstration test (RDT).

AFR will increase towards and beyond the end of the service life of a device or component. Google&#x27;s 2007 study found, based on a large field sample of drives, that actual AFRs for individual drives ranged from 1.7% for first year drives to over 8.6% for three-year-old drives. A CMU 2007 study showed an estimated 3% mean AFR over 1–5 years based on replacement logs for a large sample of drives.

<text>The siege of Belgrade, or siege of Nándorfehérvár ( or , &quot;Triumph of Nándorfehérvár&quot;; ) was a military blockade of Belgrade that occurred 4–22 July 1456 in the aftermath of the fall of Constantinople in 1453 marking the Ottomans&#x27; attempts to expand further into Europe. Led by Sultan Mehmed II, the Ottoman forces sought to capture the strategic city of Belgrade (), which was then under Hungarian control and was crucial for maintaining control over the Danube River and the Balkans.

The Hungarian defenders, under the leadership of John Hunyadi, who had garrisoned and strengthened the fortress city at his own expense, put up a determined resistance against the larger Ottoman army. The siege lasted for several weeks, during which both sides suffered heavy losses. The defenders used innovative tactics, including the use of heavy artillery and firearms, to repel the Ottoman assaults. Hunyadi&#x27;s relief force destroyed a Turkish flotilla on 14 July 1456 before repulsing their large scale assault to capture the city on 21 July. Wounded Mehmed II was compelled to lift the siege and retreat on 22 July 1456. This victory boosted the morale of European Christian forces and was seen as a turning point in their efforts as it provided a crucial buffer and temporarily halted Ottoman expansion in Europe.

John Hunyadi&#x27;s successful defence of Belgrade earned him widespread acclaim and respect as a military leader though he died of the plague a few weeks later. The Ottomans would continue their expansion in other directions, and the struggle between the Ottoman Empire and European powers persisted for centuries. The battle&#x27;s significance also extended beyond its immediate aftermath, as it demonstrated the importance of firearms and artillery in warfare, heralding a new era in military technology and tactics.

== Background ==
The Ottoman Empire, under the leadership of Sultan Mehmed II, had recently achieved a significant victory by capturing Constantinople in 1453, making it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire, thereby ending the Byzantine Empire. The Ottomans became more ambitious in their expansionist aims, seeking to extend their influence further into Europe. They considered Belgrade, a strategically positioned fortress city at the confluence of the Danube and Sava river, as a crucial gateway for their advance northward. The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s expansionist ambitions posed a significant challenge to the stability and security of European states, leading to a united effort to resist further Ottoman encroachment. In 1452 former &quot;gubernátor&quot; John Hunyadi surrendered the regency to King Ladislas V, who came of age, and became Count of Besztercze and captain general of Hungary.

== Prelude ==

After conducting two campaigns against the Serbian Despotate in 1454 and 1455, Sultan Mehmed decided to continue his conquests towards the northwest by capturing the strategically important city of Belgrade from the Kingdom of Hungary. Significant preparations were made by the Ottoman sultan for the conquest of the city, including the casting of 22 large cannons alongside many smaller ones and the establishment of a navy that would sail up the Danube to assist the army during the siege. At the end of 1455, after receiving reports of the imminent Ottoman attack, Hunyadi began preparations of his own for the fortification of the Danube, informing the papal legate that he was ready to contribute, at his own expenses, 7,000 men in the fight against the Ottomans and asking for military assistance. Hunyadi then armed the Belgrade fortress with 5,000 mercenaries that he placed under the command of his brother-in-law Mihály Szilágyi and his own eldest son László. Belgrade inhabitants came to help transporting the war machines. Hunyadi then proceeded to form a relief army of 12,000. In April 1456 general mobilisation was decreed following a Diet between the king and the noblemen.

An Italian Franciscan friar allied to Hunyadi, Giovanni da Capistrano, sent as an inquisitor to Hungary to eliminate or convert so-called heretics, (non-Catholics) started preaching a crusade to attract peasants and local countryside landlords to join the defence of Europe. 
The crusaders numbering about 25,000 included an inexperienced peasant force of about 18,000 some of them carrying only clubs and slings. The recruits came under Hunyadi&#x27;s banner, the core of which consisted of smaller bands of seasoned mercenaries and a few groups of minor knights. All in all, Hunyadi managed to build a force of 25–30,000 men.

As the Ottoman army neared Belgrade, it passed through Sofia and proceeded towards the Danube, traversing the valley of Moravia. On 18 of June, it encountered a Serbian Army of approximately 9,000 soldiers, dispatched to halt the Ottoman progress. The smaller Serbian forces were utterly devastated and defeated by the advancing Ottoman troops; towards the end of the month the Ottomans appeared near Belgrade.

== Siege ==

=== Preparation ===

Before Hunyadi could assemble his forces, the Ottoman troops from the army of Mehmed II (160,000 men in early accounts, 60–70,000 according to newer research) started appearing near Belgrade in the last days of June.

Szilágyi could rely on a force of only 5,000–7,000 men in the castle. Mehmed set up his siege on the neck of the headland and started heavily bombarding the city&#x27;s walls on July 4. He arrayed his men in three sections: The Rumelian corps had the majority of his 300 cannons, while his fleet of 200 river war vessels had the rest of them. The Rumelians were arrayed on the right wing and the Anatolian corps were arrayed on the left. In the middle were the personal guards of the Sultan, the Janissaries, and his command post. The Anatolian corps and the Janissaries were both heavy infantry troops. Mehmed posted his river vessels mainly to the northwest of the city to patrol the marshes and ensure that the fortress was not reinforced. They also kept an eye on the Sava river to the southwest to avoid the infantry from being outflanked by Hunyadi&#x27;s army. The zone from the Danube eastwards was guarded by the Sipahi, the Sultan&#x27;s feudal heavy cavalry corps, to avoid being outflanked on the right.When Hunyadi was informed of this, he was in the south of Hungary recruiting additional light cavalry troops for the army, with which he would intend to lift the siege. Although relatively few, his fellow nobles were willing to provide manpower, and the peasants were more than willing to do so. Capistrano, the Friar sent to Hungary by the Vatican both to find heretics and to preach a crusade against the Ottomans, managed to raise a large, albeit poorly trained and equipped, peasant army, with which he advanced towards Belgrade. Capistrano and Hunyadi travelled together though commanding the army separately. Both of them had gathered around 40,000–50,000 troops altogether. Once reports of the assembled relief army approaching reached the Ottoman camp, Mehmed held a war council with his generals to determine his army&#x27;s next actions. Karaca Pasha recommended that a part of Ottoman army should cross the Danube to counter the approaching relief force. This proposal was rejected by the council, particularly due to opposition by the Rumelian begs. Instead, the decision was made to prioritize capturing the city from its besieged defenders, a move seen as a tactical blunder by modern historians, as it allowed Hunyadi to set up camp across the river uncontested.

The outnumbered defenders relied mainly on the strength of the formidable castle of Belgrade, which was at the time one of the best engineered in the Balkans. Belgrade had been designated as the capital of the Serbian Despotate by Stefan Lazarević 53 years prior, in 1403–1404, and remained in Serbian hands until 1427, when it was returned to Hungarian king Sigismund. The fortress was located on a hill and designed in an elaborate form with three lines of defence: the inner castle with the palace, a huge upper town with the main military camps, four gates and a double wall, as well as the lower town with the cathedral in the urban centre and a port at the Danube. This building endeavour was one of the most elaborate military architecture achievements of the Middle Ages as it also benefitted from the natural obstacle of the rivers being at the junction of the Danube and the Sava. On 2 July Capistrano arrived at Belgrade.

=== Naval battle ===
Hunyadi established his camp in the vicinity of the Zemun fortress, while the Ottoman fleet encircled Belgrade along the Danube to put a stop to the provisioning of the city. Hunyadi&#x27;s primary objective was to secure the river passage to support and supply the besieged garrison. To achieve this, he commanded the assembly of all ships on the Danube and communicated with Szilágyi, instructing him to be prepared to launch an attack on the Ottoman fleet from a strategic position. Szilágyi readied around forty vessels, crewed by Serbians from the city. The Ottoman Naval Flotilla facing them, depending on the source, was made up of 21 to as much as 200 vessels.

On July 14, 1456, after 5 hours of battle on the river, Hunyadi broke the naval blockade sinking three large Ottoman galleys and capturing four large vessels and 20 smaller ones. By destroying the Sultan&#x27;s fleet, Hunyadi was able to transport his troops and much-needed food into the city. The fort&#x27;s defenders were also reinforced.

=== Ottoman assault ===
Infuriated by the failure on the Danube, Mehmed ordered his cannoneers to continuously fire upon the city walls, in preparation for a final offensive to take the city. The defenders responded with fire of their own, managing to kill Karaca Pasha with a cannonball. In the build-up to the general assault, the Ottomans launched small attacks each day, which were forcefully rejected. The continuous bombardment resulted in several breaches opening on the walls of the fortress. On July 21 Mehmed launched an all-out assault that began at sundown and continued all night. The besieging army flooded the city and then started its assault on the fort. As this was the most crucial moment of the siege, Hunyadi ordered the defenders to throw tarred wood and other flammable material, and then set it afire. Soon a wall of flames separated the Janissaries fighting in the city from their fellow soldiers trying to breach through the gaps into the upper town. The battle between the encircled Janissaries and Szilágyi&#x27;s soldiers inside the upper town was turning in favour of the Christians, and the Hungarians managed to beat off the fierce assault from outside the walls. The Janissaries remaining inside the city were thus massacred while the Ottoman troops trying to breach the upper town suffered heavy losses.

=== Final battle ===
The next day, by some accounts, the peasant crusaders started a spontaneous action, and forced Capistrano and Hunyadi to make use of the situation. Despite Hunyadi&#x27;s orders to the defenders not to try to loot the Ottoman positions, some of the units crept out from demolished ramparts, took up positions across from the Ottoman line, and began harassing enemy soldiers. Ottoman Sipahis tried without success to disperse the harassing force. At once, more defenders joined those outside the wall. What began as an isolated incident quickly escalated into a full-scale battle.

John of Capistrano at first tried to order his men back inside the walls, but soon found himself surrounded by about 2,000 peasant levymen. He then began leading them toward the Ottoman lines, crying, &quot;The Lord who made the beginning will take care of the finish!&quot; Capistrano led his crusaders to the Ottoman rear across the Sava river. At the same time, Hunyadi started a desperate charge out of the fort to capture the cannons in the Ottoman encampment.

The Christian counter offensive managed to gain significant ground against the Ottoman troops, eventually reaching as far as the Ottoman camp and capturing their artillery. At this crucial point of the battle, one of the viziers advised Mehmed to abandon the camp for his safety, which he refused to do so on the grounds that it would be a “sign of cowardice”. After this, Mehmed personally joined the fighting, accompanied by two of his begs. The Sultan managed to personally kill a number of enemy soldiers before being injured, forcing him to abandon the battlefield. The news of their Sultan fighting alongside them caused a morale boost amongst the Ottoman army, which allowed them to go on the offensive again and push the Christian forces out of the Ottoman camp. The actions of the Sultan and the arrival of reinforcements had prevented a complete rout of the Ottoman army; however, the army had been far too weakened to continue the siege, and repeated Ottoman attempts at recapturing their cannons resulted in failure. This led the Ottoman war council to decide on ending the siege. During the night of July 22 to 23, the Ottomans buried their dead according to their customs, loaded their wounded in a long row of wagons, and evacuated the camp in a hurry, heading southeast. The Christian forces weren&#x27;t able to pursue after them. The following day the crusader army entered the now abandoned Ottoman camp, finding immense loot left behind by the retreating Ottoman army.

== Aftermath ==
It is claimed that after the defeat, while he and his army were retreating into Bulgaria, the failure as well as the ensuing loss of no less than 24,000 of his best soldiers angered Mehmed in such a manner that, in an uncontrollable fit of fury, he wounded a number of his generals with his own sword, before ordering their executions.

However, the Hungarians paid dearly for this victory. Plague broke out in the camp, from which John Hunyadi himself died three weeks later in Zimony, Hungary (later Zemun, Serbia) on 11 August 1456. He was buried in the Cathedral of &quot;Gyulafehérvár&quot; (now Alba Iulia), the capital of Transylvania.

As the design of the fortress had proved its merits during the siege, some additional reinforcements were made by the Hungarians. The weaker eastern walls, where the Ottomans broke through into the upper town were reinforced by the Zindan Gate and the heavy Nebojša Tower. This was the last of the great modifications to the fortress until 1521, when Mehmed&#x27;s great-grandson Suleiman eventually captured it.

== Noon bell ==

Pope Callixtus III ordered the bells of every European church to be rung every day at noon, as a call for believers to pray for the defenders of the city. The practice of the noon bell is traditionally attributed to the international commemoration of the victory at Belgrade and to the order of Pope Callixtus III, since in many countries (like England and the Spanish kingdoms) news of the victory arrived before the order, and the ringing of the church bells at noon was thus transformed into a commemoration of the victory. The Pope did not withdraw the order, and Catholic and the older Protestant churches still ring the noon bell to this day.

As he had previously ordered all Catholic kingdoms to pray for the victory of the defenders of Belgrade, the Pope celebrated the victory by making an enactment to commemorate the day. This led to the legend that the noon bell ritual undertaken in Catholic and old Protestant churches, enacted by the Pope before the battle, was founded to commemorate the victory. The day of the victory, July 22, has been a memorial day in Hungary ever since.

This custom still exists also among Protestant and Orthodox congregations. In the history of the University of Oxford, the victory was welcomed with the ringing of bells and great celebrations in England. Hunyadi sent a special courier, Erasmus Fullar, among others to Oxford with the news of the victory.

== Legacy ==
The victory stopped the Ottoman advance towards Europe beyond the Balkans for 70 years, though they made other incursions such as the taking of Otranto between 1480 and 1481; and the raid of Croatia and Styria in 1493. Belgrade would continue to protect Hungary from Ottoman attacks until the fort fell to the Ottomans in 1521.

After the siege of Belgrade stopped the advance of Mehmed II towards Central Europe, Serbia and Bosnia were absorbed into the Empire. Wallachia, the Crimean Khanate, and eventually Moldavia were merely converted into vassal states due to the strong military resistance to Mehmed&#x27;s attempts of conquest. There were several reasons of why the Sultan did not directly attack Hungary and why he gave up the idea of advancing in that direction after his unsuccessful siege of Belgrade. The mishap at Belgrade indicated that the Empire could not expand further until Serbia and Bosnia were transformed into a secure base of operations. Furthermore, the significant political and military power of Hungary under Matthias Corvinus in the region surely influenced this hesitation too. Moreover, Mehmed was also distracted in his attempts to suppress insubordination from his Moldovan and Wallachian vassals.

With Hunyadi&#x27;s victory at Belgrade, both Vlad III the Impaler and Stephen III of Moldavia came to power in their own domains, and Hunyadi himself went to great lengths to have his son Matthias placed on the Hungarian throne. While fierce resistance and Hunyadi&#x27;s effective leadership ensured that the daring and ambitious Sultan Mehmed would only get as far into Europe as the Balkans, the Sultan had already managed to transform the Ottoman Empire into what would become one of the most feared powers in Europe (as well as in Asia) for centuries. Most of Hungary was eventually conquered in 1526 at the Battle of Mohács. Ottoman Muslim expansion into Europe continued with menacing success until the siege of Vienna in 1529, although Ottoman power in Europe remained strong and still threatening to Central Europe at times until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.

== Literature and art ==

English poet and playwright Hannah Brand wrote a five-act tragedy about the battle and siege of Belgrade, which was first performed in 1791. A fictional series about the siege from the viewpoint of a Christian mercenary is Christian Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Tom Swan and the Siege of Belgrade&quot;, published from 2014 to 2015.

<text>Windhexe (German, literally: &quot;wind witch&quot;) is a grinding and dehydrating apparatus operated with compressed air typically used in waste reduction and food processing. The Windhexe was unveiled in 2002 and operates via compressed air injected into a conical chamber which tumbles material at high speeds causing simultaneous dehydration and disintegration. The limited application of the Windhexe is in waste reduction and in animal processing with more proposed uses being explored commercially.

== History ==

The Windhexe was invented by retired Kansas farmer Frank Polifka, who began work on it following retirement. The Windhexe was unveiled to a small group of the local press in 2002, following 15 years of work by Polifka. Polifka died August 23, 2012, of natural causes in Catherine, Kansas The commercial use of the Windhexe machine is now controlled by Vortex Dehydration Technology LLC, a company co-founded by Polifka. The company now licenses and maintains Windhexe machines for industrial and commercial use for a per-tonne fee. The company now employs 12 and has an annual revenue that exceeds $3,000,000 USD annually.

== Description ==
The Windhexe operates using heated pressurized air. The pressurized air is forced into a conical chamber where it forms a high speed vortex which tumbles material against the inside wall, pulverizing it into a fine powder while simultaneously dehydrating the finished product. 
Compressed air is injected at the top through nozzles. Small deflection plates then force that air to flow in a counterclockwise direction, creating a miniature tornado in the funnel-shaped can. Using just a fraction of the energy employed by conventional crushers and dryers, the Windhexe breaks solid material down to roughly micron size, increasing its surface area so that heated air can dehydrate the material quickly. The Windhexe operates without any moving parts and can quickly and loudly disintegrate and dehydrate materials ranging from shoes, rocks, sludge, concrete and industrial waste to glass, agricultural and animal waste.

== Applications ==
The patent application for the Windhexe mentions possible uses in pasteurization, desalinization of salt water, and kitchen appliances. The Windhexe has yet to be used on a large scale industrially but it has been used in a limited capacity in an array of applications. Windhexe is currently being used to process collagen powder from eggshells, creating a plentiful supply of the expensive protein that is used in cosmetics and medical procedures such as skin grafts. The Windhexe is also being used to dry lignite coal in Australia, a process by which impurities are removed from the coal pre-burn producing a cleaner burning fuel.

=== Waste reduction ===
One of the main uses of the Windhexe is in solid waste reduction. The Windhexe processes materials to take up as little as 1/10th of the original volume. The Windhexe is currently being used for this purpose in several large industrial plants throughout the west coast. This process can be done without the use of heat in the compressed air because waste reduction does not typically need the dehydration feature of the Windhexe.

=== Animal processing ===
Animal processing was one of the first proposed uses of the Windhexe. The machine can take the remains from meat processing plants, trimmed waste and animal parts that are typically thrown away, and produce what Vortex Dehydration Technology calls highly nutritional “edible systems,” such as bouillon, powdered extracts and flavorings and dried soups. This differs from the current process which only uses non waste animal products to create edible systems because it allows parts now classified as waste to be used commercially.

<text>The Navigators is a worldwide Christian para-church organization based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 

==Overview==
On April 18 2015, Mutua Mahiaini succeeded Michael W. Treneer as the fifth International President of The Navigators. Treneer had been international president for 10 years, after Jerry White. Marvin Campbell is Navigators&#x27; US president.

==History==

The Navigators was founded in 1933 by the evangelist Dawson Trotman, who mentored United States Navy sailor Lester Spencer aboard . Due to those efforts, 135 additional sailors on Spencer&#x27;s ship became Christians before it was sunk at Pearl Harbor. By the end of World War II, thousands of men on ships and bases around the world were learning through The Navigators.

The collegiate ministry of The Navigators was founded in 1951 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This ministry was established by a group of students in the Sigma Nu fraternity house who, along with Trotman, decided to spread their outreach onto the college campus.

===Move to Glen Eyrie===

In 1953, The Navigators acquired its current headquarters location at Glen Eyrie through the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association&#x27;s sale of the then-vacant property to Trotman&#x27;s organization. The 330-acre Eagle Lake property was included in the purchase, on the condition that it be used for youth work. In 2014, over 4,700 campers participated in Eagle Lake Camps. 

The main administrative center for the Navigators is situated towards the northeast region of Glen Eyrie&#x27;s territory. It serves as the main hub for coordinating their various activities and operations.

===MRFF lawsuits===

The Navigators organization was cited in a lawsuit against the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) by Michael L. &quot;Mickey&quot; Weinstein of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) in 2005. The lawsuit alleged that Darren and Gina Lindblom, assigned to the USAFA through The Navigators, were favored by the Air Force to the exclusion of other religious groups in violation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. This lawsuit was dismissed. Additional lawsuits by the MRFF have named The Navigators in similar complaints of alleged proselytizing in the military. 

In Korea, The Navigators sued six former members of the MRFF for libel in 2011. The case was initially dismissed, and again dismissed on appeal.

==Overseas Groups==

The Navigators came to the UK through the Billy Graham crusades of the 1950s. They are now based in Southampton, England. 

Apart from the US and the UK, the Navigators have missions in 19 other countries, including Brazil, Austria and Eurasia.

<text>Komenda (; ) is a village in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Komenda. It includes the formerly independent settlement of Kaplja Vas (, ).

==Name==
Komenda was first mentioned in written sources in 1147–54 as &quot;de sancto Petro&quot; (and as &quot;hospitale Sancti Petri&quot; in 1296, &quot;in der pharren von Sand Peter&quot; in 1322, and &quot;comendator ad S. Petrum&quot; in 1446). The name of the village is identical to the Slovene common noun &quot;komenda&quot; &#x27;commandry&#x27;, referring to a property and residence owned by the Knights Hospitaller from 1223 to 1872. The noun &quot;komenda&quot; is borrowed (probably via German &quot;Kommende&quot;) from Medieval Latin &quot;commenda&quot; &#x27;entrusted property&#x27;. In the past the German name was &quot;Commenda&quot;.

==Mass grave==

Komenda is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Svešek Alder Mass Grave () is located at the edge of the Svešek Alder Woods () along a forest road northwest of Žeje pri Komendi. It contains the remains of 10 to 15 prisoners from Kamnik murdered in May and June 1945. Their nationalities and whether they were soldiers or civilians is unknown.
==Church==

Above the settlement is a complex with a castle, the parish church dedicated to Saint Peter, a parsonage, stables, and a cemetery. A church in Komenda was first referred to in documents dating to 1147. In 1726 the old church was pulled down to make way for the new building. The current one was built in the Baroque style and completed in 1729. It was based on plans by the architect Gregor Maček Jr. The interior and the surroundings were redesigned in the first half of the 20th century based on plans by the architect Jože Plečnik.

==Cultural heritage==
In addition to Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, several other structures in Komenda have protected cultural monument status:
*The commandery of the Knights Hospitaller, also known as the Šmid Manor (), is located immediately northwest of Saint Peter&#x27;s Church. It is a two-story structure with four wings and an irregular interior courtyard. Its foundations date to the 13th century, and it was renovated in 1872 and again in 1909. The Partisans burned it in 1944, setting a fire in each room, which destroyed all of the furnishings and badly damaged the frescoes and Gothic stonework.
*The Glavar House () is located at Glavar Street () no. 77. It is a two-story structure that Peter Pavel Glavar had built in 1752. Glavar&#x27;s coat of arms stands above the door casing, and the exterior has three frescoes painted by Franc Jelovšek (1700–1764).
*The Glavar Hospital () is located south of the cemetery at Glavar Street () nos. 104 and 106. It is a two-story building with nine bays, a vaulted interior, and an arcaded walkway in the rear. It was built at the bequest of Peter Pavel Glavar to serve the poor, infirm, and aged. The hospital operated from 1805 to 1947.

==Notable people==
Notable people who were born or lived in Komenda include:
* Pietro Giacomo de Testaferrata (; 1673–1763), Maltese knight
* Peter Pavel Glavar (1721–1784), priest, beekeeper, writer, and businessman
* Ivan Selan (1902–1981), counterfeiter and cartographer
* Ivan Sivec (born 1949), writer and journalist
* Agata Zupin (born 1998), hurdles runner
* Tadej Pogačar (born 1998), professional cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner

<doc id="794197" wikidata="Q2770802" url="?curid=794197" title="Ice cream van">
<text>An ice cream van (British) or ice cream truck (American) is a commercial vehicle that serves as a cold-food specialty food truck or a mobile retail outlet for pre-packaged ice cream, usually during the spring and summer. Ice cream vans are often seen parked at public events, or near parks, beaches, or other areas where people congregate. Ice cream vans often travel near where children play – outside schools, in residential areas, or in other locations. They usually stop briefly before moving on to the next street. Along the sides, a large sliding window acts as a serving hatch, and this often displays pictures of the available products and their prices. Most ice cream vans tend to sell both pre-manufactured ice pops in wrappers, and soft serve ice cream from a machine, served in a cone, and often with a chocolate flake (in Britain), a sugary syrup, or toppings such as sprinkles. While franchises or chains are rare within the ice cream truck community (most trucks are independently owned and run), some do exist.

In some locations, ice cream van operators have diversified to fill gaps in the market for soft drinks, using their capacity for refrigerated storage to sell chilled cans and bottles.

==History==

Early ice cream vans carried simple ice cream, during a time when most families did not own a freezer. As freezers became more commonplace, ice cream vans moved towards selling novelty ice cream items, such as bars and ice pops.

A distinctive feature of ice cream vans is their musical chimes, often bearing the likeness of a music box, primarily to attract children. Early ice cream vans utilize electro-mechanical music boxes, with electronic systems becoming more common in the late 20th century. 

The chimes often take the form of famous and recognizable tunes. In the United States and Canada, ice cream truck songs include &quot;The Band Played On&quot;, &quot;Camptown Races&quot;, &quot;Brahms&#x27; Lullaby&quot;, &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Popeye the Sailor Man&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;, &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;, &quot;The Mister Softee Jingle&quot;, &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;, &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot;, &quot;Picnic&quot; (a Japanese children&#x27;s song usually played with a voice saying, &quot;hello&quot; at the beginning of the song), &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, &quot;Red Wing&quot;, &quot;Sailing, Sailing&quot;, &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;, and &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;. In the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, ice cream vans traditionally play &quot;Greensleeves&quot;.

Some ice cream vans also use excerpts of classical music as their chimes. In some countries, they may play their respective national folk songs.

==In the United Kingdom==
There are mainly two types of ice cream vans in the United Kingdom: a &quot;hard van&quot;, which sells scoop ice cream and is only equipped with a freezer and a &quot;soft van&quot;, which has a freezer and also a soft serve &quot;whippy&quot; machine for serving ice cream cones and screwballs. They are usually converted from factory standard vans with the rear cut away and replaced with a fibre glass body (to reduce the weight).

Because of the British climate, running an ice cream van profitably is not only very difficult outside summer, but is also an unpredictable business. A summer heatwave can provoke a massive upturn in fortunes for a few days, but after the weather has cooled sales drop off dramatically. The need to take advantage of rare and short-lived opportunities can result in the fierce rivalry between ice cream vans in coterminous areas, with the main disputes being over who is entitled to sell ice cream in a particular &#x27;patch&#x27;. This has also led to some ice cream van vendors diversifying and selling other products such as crisps, chips, burgers or hot dogs from their vehicles at other times of the year.

In a number of Local Authority areas, particularly in London Boroughs with existing street markets, street trading regulations prohibit ice cream vans from remaining in one static location. The legislation also contains powers to ban ice-cream vans from specific streets. Proposals in the current London Local Authorities Bill would allow only 15 minutes trading per vehicle per street each day. There also exists a nationwide code of practice for the use of chimes, which limits the volume to 80 dB and the duration to twelve seconds, but these are rarely observed nor enforced. Chimes must not be played more often than every three minutes, near hospitals, schools and churches when they are in use. The traditional chimes for ice cream vans in the United Kingdom is &quot;Greensleeves&quot; or &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, although there are also variants that play popular folk and children&#x27;s songs, much like the American equivalents.

In Scotland, ice cream vans have been used to sell smuggled cigarettes and, in the 1980s Glasgow ice cream wars, as front organizations to sell illicit drugs. 

===Ice cream van manufacturer===

Whitby Morrison, based in Crewe, Cheshire, was founded by Bryan Whitby who filed a UK patent in 1965 for mobile ice cream producing equipment through which soft serve units were powered off the van&#x27;s drive mechanism. Today, the company is the UK&#x27;s biggest ice cream van manufacturer, producing around 100 vans a year; its products have been exported to over 60 countries. The company has also been developing a fully electric on-board battery system to power the soft-scoop machines it fits; the first all-electric van was expected to be delivered in the summer of 2019.

==In the United States==
In the United States, ice cream trucks are mostly built from multi-stop trucks, such as the Chevrolet Step-Van. 

Apart from ice cream, ice cream trucks may also sell snow cones, Italian ice or water ice, snacks, soft drinks, and candy. Many trucks carry a sign, in the shape of a stop sign, that warns other drivers of children crossing the street to buy food or ice cream. They also play music to attract consumers to their trucks. With the advent of social media networking, many ice cream truck operators are redefining the traditional business model. Not satisfied with the traditional approach of cruising for customers, some operators such as gourmet ice cream sandwich maker Coolhaus are developing followings on social media sites and &quot;announcing&quot; the location of their trucks.

Professionally-built ice cream trucks that sell prepackaged foods are called &quot;novelty trucks&quot;. They use commercial cold plate freezers that plug in overnight and when unplugged maintain their temperature for at least 12 hours. Historically, the chimes are mechanical, such as using an amplified music box or a tape. In the recent times, the chimes commonly use digital soundchips that have no moving parts. Such systems may be able to play multiple tunes and have adjustable volume.

==In Scandinavia==
===Norway===
Norway has two leading ice-cream van companies; Isbilen (lit. ice-car) by Fråst, and Diplom-isbilen by Diplom-Is. Diplom-Isbilen sell ice cream made by Diplom-Is, and isbilen sell ice cream made by Isbjørn-Is, they also sell fish. The ice cream vans can be heard from afar, and attract customers to the street by playing the iconic tune &quot;Norge rundt&quot;, symbolizing their presence all over the country.

===Sweden===
Hemglass is the Swedish brand of the ice cream manufacturer Hjem-IS Europa A/S and was launched in Sweden in 1968. The company distributes its products in ice cream trucks in Sweden  Hemglass and Denmark (Hjem-IS).

<text>Swansea is a former settlement and unincorporated community in Inyo County, California. It is located south of New York Butte, at an elevation of .

Swansea was a boomtown located on the eastern shore of Owens Lake. Spawned by the success of the silver mining operations in the nearby Cerro Gordo Mines in the late 1860s, Swansea became a hub for smelting the ore and transporting the resulting ingots to Los Angeles, over 200 miles away. The smelter operated from 1869 to 1874.

Swansea was named after the town Swansea in south Wales, which was known as &quot;Copperopolis&quot; due to its large smelting industry from which many experienced extractive metallurgists emigrated to the United States.

The 1872 Lone Pine earthquake damaged the smelters and uplifted the shoreline, rendering the Swansea pier inaccessible by Owens Lake steamships. As a result, most of the smelting and transportation business moved to Keeler, approximately one mile to the south.

In the summer of 1874, a thunderstorm-induced debris flow inundated Swansea under several feet of water, rock, and sand. By then the town had been almost deserted, and the debris flow marked the end of Swansea.

As of 2007, only one building and a smelter foundation remained alongside California Route 136 (about 10 miles southeast of Lone Pine). The community is now a ghost town.

<doc id="794218" wikidata="Q2079534" url="?curid=794218" title="World War II Victory Medal">
<text>The World War II Victory Medal was a service medal of the United States military which was established by an Act of Congress on 6 July 1945 (Public Law 135, 79th Congress) and promulgated by Section V, War Department Bulletin 12, 1945.

==History==
The World War II Victory Medal was established by an Act of Congress on 6 July 1945 (Public Law 135, 79th Congress) and promulgated by Section V, War Department Bulletin 12, 1945. The medal was designed by Thomas H. Jones and approved by the Secretary of War on 5 February 1946. Consequently, it did not transition from a ribbon to a full medal until after World War II had ended. The World War II Victory Medal was first issued as a service ribbon, referred to as the &quot;Victory Ribbon.&quot; 

The Congressional authorization for the medal specified that it was to be awarded to any member of the United States military, including members of the armed forces of the Government of the Philippine Islands, who served on active duty, or as a reservist, between 7 December 1941 and the ending of hostilities as declared by the president.

On 8 August 1946, the separate Merchant Marine World War II Victory Medal was established for members of the United States Merchant Marine who served during World War II.

==Criteria==
The World War II Victory Medal was awarded for service between 7 December 1941 and 31 December 1946, both dates inclusive, with no minimum time in service requirement. The National Personnel Records Center has reported some cases of service members receiving the award for only a few days of service. As hostilities during the Second World War ended on 2 September 1945, there may be cases of service members who had enlisted, entered officer candidate school, or had been a cadet or midshipman at the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy or the U.S. Coast Guard Academy between 3 September 1945 and any date in 1946, receiving the medal without having been a veteran of the period of active hostilities during the war; the reason for this late date is that President Harry S. Truman did not declare an official end to hostilities until the last day of 1946.

As every member of the United States Armed Forces who served from 7 December 1941 to 31 December 1946 was eligible for the medal, there were over twelve million eligible recipients, making the World War II Victory Medal the second most widely awarded military award of the United States, after the National Defense Service Medal.

==Appearance==
The bronze medal is 1 inches in width. The obverse is a figure of Liberation standing full length with head turned to dexter looking to the dawn of a new day, right foot resting on a war god&#x27;s helmet with the hilt of a broken sword in the right hand and the broken blade in the left hand, the inscription &quot;WORLD WAR II&quot; placed immediately below the center. On the 
reverse are inscriptions for the Four Freedoms: &quot;FREEDOM FROM FEAR AND WANT&quot; and &quot;FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RELIGION&quot; separated by a palm branch, all within a circle composed of the words &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 1941 1945&quot;.

The suspension and service ribbon of the medal is 1 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: inch double rainbow in juxtaposition (blues, greens, yellows, reds (center), yellows greens and blues); inch White 67101; center inch Old Glory Red 67156; inch White; and inch double rainbow in juxtaposition. The rainbow on each side of the ribbon is a miniature of the pattern used in the World War I Victory Medal.

Although the World War I Victory Medal included clasps, the World War II Victory Medal did not. This was because campaign medals were awarded instead.

<doc id="794226" wikidata="Q955546" url="?curid=794226" title="Coalbed methane">
<text>&quot;Coalbed methane&quot; (CBM or coal-bed methane), coalbed gas, or coal seam gas (CSG) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds. In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.

The term refers to methane absorbed into the solid matrix of the coal. It is called &#x27;sweet gas&#x27; because of its lack of hydrogen sulfide. The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining, where it presents a serious safety risk. Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir, as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called adsorption. The methane is in a near-liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix). The open fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water.

Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs, coalbed methane contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane, and no natural-gas condensate. It often contains up to a few percent carbon dioxide. Coalbed methane is generally formed due to thermal maturation of kerogen and organic matter, in contrast to coal seams with regular groundwater recharge where methane is typically generated by microbial communities living in situ.

==History==
Coalbed methane grew out of venting methane from coal seams. Some coal beds have long been known to be &quot;gassy,&quot; and as a safety measure, boreholes were drilled into the seams from the surface, and the methane allowed to vent before mining.

Coalbed methane as a natural-gas resource received a major push from the US federal government in the late 1970s. Federal price controls were discouraging natural gas drilling by keeping natural gas prices below market levels; at the same time, the government wanted to encourage more gas production. The US Department of Energy funded research into a number of unconventional gas sources, including coalbed methane. Coalbed methane was exempted from federal price controls, and was also given a federal tax credit.

In Australia, commercial extraction of coal seam gas began in 1996 in the Bowen Basin of Queensland.

==Reservoir properties==
Gas contained in coal bed methane is mainly methane and trace quantities of ethane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and few other gases. Intrinsic properties of coal as found in nature determine the amount of gas that can be recovered.

===Porosity===
Coalbed methane reservoirs are considered as a dual-porosity reservoirs. Dual porosity reservoirs are reservoirs in which porosity related to cleats (natural fractures) are responsible for flow behavior and reservoir porosity of the matrix is responsible for the storage of gas. The porosity of a coalbed methane reservoir can vary from 10%-20%; However, the cleat porosity of the reservoir is estimated to be in the range of 0.1%-1%

===Adsorption capacity===
Adsorption capacity of coal is defined as the volume of gas adsorbed per unit mass of coal usually expressed in SCF (&quot;standard cubic feet&quot;, the volume at standard pressure and temperature conditions) gas/ton of coal. The capacity to adsorb depends on the rank and quality of coal. The range is usually between 100 and 800 SCF/ton for most coal seams found in the US. Most of the gas in coal beds is in the adsorbed form. When the reservoir is put into production, water in the fracture spaces is pumped off on first. This leads to a reduction of pressure enhancing desorption of gas from the matrix.

===Fracture permeability===
Fracture permeability acts as the major channel for the gas to flow. The higher the permeability, the higher the gas production. For most coal seams found in the US, the permeability lies in the range of 0.1–50 milliDarcys. The permeability of fractured reservoirs changes with the stress applied to them. Coal displays a stress-sensitive permeability and this process plays an important role during stimulation and production operations. Fracture permeability in Coalbed methane reservoir tends to increase with depletion of gas; in contrast to conventional reservoirs. This unique behavior is because of shrinking of coal, when methane is released from its matrix, which results in opening up of fractures and increased permeability. It is also believed that due to shrinkage of coal matrix at lower reservoir pressures, there is a loss of horizontal stress in the reservoir which induces in-situ failure of coal. Such a failure has been attributed to sudden decrease in the fracture permeability of the reservoir

===Thickness of formation and initial reservoir pressure===
The thickness of the formation may not be directly proportional to the volume of gas produced in some areas.

For example, it has been observed in the Cherokee Basin in Southeast Kansas that a well with a single zone of of pay can produce excellent gas rates, whereas an alternative formation with twice the thickness can produce next to nothing. Some coal (and shale) formations may have high gas concentrations regardless of the formation&#x27;s thickness, probably due to other factors of the area&#x27;s geology.

The pressure difference between the well block and the sand face should be as high as possible as is the case with any producing reservoir in general.

===Other properties===
Other affecting parameters include coal density, initial gas-phase concentration, critical gas saturation, irreducible water saturation, relative permeability to water and gas at conditions of Sw = 1.0 and Sg = 1-Sw irreducible respectively.

==Extraction==

To extract the gas, a steel-encased hole is drilled into the coal seam below ground. As the pressure within the coal seam declines due to natural production or the pumping of water from the coalbed, both gas and &quot;produced water&quot; come to the surface through tubing. Then the gas is sent to a compressor station and into natural gas pipelines. The produced water is either reinjected into isolated formations, released into streams, used for irrigation, or sent to evaporation ponds. The water typically contains dissolved solids such as sodium bicarbonate and chloride but varies depending on the formation geology.

Coalbed methane wells often produce at lower gas rates than conventional reservoirs, typically peaking at near per day (about 0.100 m³/s), and can have large initial costs. The production profiles of CBM wells are typically characterized by a &quot;negative decline&quot; in which the gas production rate initially increases as the water is pumped off and gas begins to desorb and flow. A dry CBM well is similar to a standard gas well.

The methane desorption process follows a curve (of gas content vs. reservoir pressure) called a Langmuir isotherm. The isotherm can be analytically described by a maximum gas content (at infinite pressure), and the pressure at which half that gas exists within the coal. These parameters (called the Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure, respectively) are properties of the coal, and vary widely. A coal in Alabama and a coal in Colorado may have radically different Langmuir parameters, despite otherwise similar coal properties.

As production occurs from a coal reservoir, the changes in pressure are believed to cause changes in the porosity and permeability of the coal. This is commonly known as matrix shrinkage/swelling. As the gas is desorbed, the pressure exerted by the gas inside the pores decreases, causing them to shrink in size and restricting gas flow through the coal. As the pores shrink, the overall matrix shrinks as well, which may eventually increase the space the gas can travel through (the cleats), increasing gas flow.

The potential of a particular coalbed as a CBM source depends on the following criteria. Cleat density/intensity: cleats are joints confined within coal sheets. They impart permeability to the coal seam. A high cleat density is required for profitable exploitation of CBM. Also important is the maceral composition: maceral is a microscopic, homogeneous, petrographic entity of a corresponding sedimentary rock. A high vitrinite composition is ideal for CBM extraction, while inertinite hampers the same.

The rank of coal has also been linked to CBM content: a vitrinite reflectance of 0.8–1.5% has been found to imply higher productivity of the coalbed.

The gas composition must be considered, because natural gas appliances are designed for gas with a heating value of about 1,000 BTU (British thermal units) per cubic foot, or nearly pure methane. If the gas contains more than a few percent non-flammable gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, either these will have to be removed or it will have to be blended with higher-BTU gas to achieve &quot;pipeline quality&quot;. If the methane composition of the coalbed gas is less than 92%, it may not be commercially marketable.

==Environmental impacts==

===Methane===
As with all carbon-based fossil fuels, burning coalbed methane releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Its effect as greenhouse gas was first analyzed by chemist and physicist Svante Arrhenius. CBM production also entails leaks of fugitive methane into the atmosphere. Methane is rated as having 72 times the effect on global warming per unit of mass than CO2. over 20 years, reducing to 25 times over 100 years and 7.5 times over 500 years. Analysis of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources indicates that generating electricity from CBM, as with conventional natural gas, has less than half the greenhouse gas effect of coal.

Multiple Australian studies have indicated the long term negative environmental effects of coal seam gas extraction, both locally and globally.

In the United States, methane escaping from coal during mining amounts to seven percent of total methane emissions. Recovery of coal mine methane in advance of mining is seen as a major opportunity to reduce methane emissions. Companies like CNX Resources have methane abatement programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from active and closed mines.

===Infrastructure===
CBM wells are connected by a network of roads, pipelines, and compressor stations. Over time, wells may be spaced more closely in order to extract the remaining methane.

===Produced water===
The produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction varies greatly in quality from area to area, but may contain undesirable concentrations of dissolved substances such as salts, naturally present chemicals, heavy metals and radionuclides. In many producing regions the water is treated, such as through a Reverse Osmosis plant and used beneficially for irrigation, water for livestock, urban and industrial uses, or dust suppression.

==== Pilliga Scrub ====

In 2012 Eastern Star Gas was fined for &quot;discharging polluting water containing high levels of salt into Bohena Creek&quot; in the Pilliga Scrub. There were &quot;16 spills or leaks of contaminated water&quot; including &quot;serious spills of saline water into woodland and a creek.&quot; In 2012, a NSW Legislative Council inquiry criticised the use of open holding ponds, recommending that &quot;the NSW Government ban the open storage of produced water.&quot;

====Powder River Basin====
Not all coalbed methane produced water is saline or otherwise undesirable. Water from coalbed methane wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, US, commonly meets federal drinking water standards, and is widely used in the area to water livestock. Its use for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio.

===Groundwater===
Depending on aquifer connectivity, water withdrawal may depress aquifers over a large area and affect groundwater flows. In Australia, the CBM industry estimates extraction of to of groundwater per year; while the National Water Commission estimates extraction above a year.

=== Power generation ===
In 2012, the Aspen Skiing Company built a 3-megawatt methane-to-electricity plant in Somerset, Colorado at Oxbow Carbon&#x27;s Elk Creek Mine.

==Coalbed methane producing areas==

===Australia===

Coal Seam Gas resources are in the major coal basins in Queensland and New South Wales, with further potential resources in South Australia. Commercial recovery of coal seam gas (CSG) began in Australia in 1996. As of 2014, coal seam gas, from Queensland and New South Wales, made up about ten percent of Australia&#x27;s gas production. Demonstrated reserves were estimated to be 33 trillion cubic feet (35 905 petajoules) as of January 2014.

* Bowen Basin
* Surat Basin
* Sydney Basin

===Canada===
In Canada, British Columbia is estimated to have approximately of coalbed gas. Alberta, in 2013, was the only province with commercial coalbed methane wells and is estimated to have approximately of economically recoverable coalbed methane, with overall reserves totaling up to .

Coalbed methane is considered a non-renewable resource, although the Alberta Research Council, Alberta Geological Survey and others have argued coalbed methane is a renewable resource because the bacterial action that formed the methane is ongoing. This is subject to debate since it has also been shown that the dewatering that accompanies CBM production destroys the conditions needed for the bacteria to produce methane and the rate of formation of additional methane is undetermined. This debate is currently causing a right of ownership issue in the Canadian province of Alberta, as only non-renewable resources can legally be owned by the province.

===United Kingdom===
Although gas in place in Britain&#x27;s coal fields has been estimated to be 2,900 billion cubic meters, it may be that as little as one percent might be economically recoverable. Britain&#x27;s CBM potential is largely untested. Some methane is extracted by coal mine venting operations, and burned to generate electricity. Assessment by private industry of coalbed methane wells independent of mining began in 2008, when 55 onshore exploration licences were issued, covering 7,000 square kilometers of potential coalbed methane areas. IGas Energy became the first in the UK to commercially extract coalbed methane separate from mine venting; as of 2012, the Igas coalbed methane wells at Doe Green, extracting gas for electrical generation, were the only commercial CBM wells in the UK. The use of CBM (in GWh) for electricity generation in the UK is as shown.&lt;graph&gt;{

===United States===
United States coalbed methane production in 2017 was 1.76 trillion cubic feet (TCF), 3.6 percent of all US dry gas production that year. The 2017 production was down from the peak of 1.97 TCF in 2008. Most CBM production came from the Rocky Mountain states of Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan could witness the development of a large coalbed methane (CBM) sector over the coming decades, according to industry professionals. Preliminary research suggests there may be as much as 900 billion m3 of gas in Kazakhstan&#x27;s main coalfields – 85% of all reserves in Kazakhstan.

===India===
Great Eastern Energy (GEECL) was the first company with a field development plan approved. With the completion of the drilling of 23 vertical production wells by GEECL, coalbed methane became commercially available in India on 14 July 2007 with CNG priced at ₹30 per kg. Initially 90% of the CBM would be distributed as CNG gas to fuel vehicles.

GEECL is responsible for Southeast Asia&#x27;s first CBM station and is also locating one in the West Bengal city of Asansol.

Prashant Modi, President and Chief Operating Officer of GEECL, said, &quot;With the nation requiring higher energy sources to sustain its development pace, we are confident that CBM will play an important role as one of the prime energy sources for the future generations.&quot;

Essar Group&#x27;s Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Ltd.&#x27;s CBM portfolio includes 5 blocks. Currently, only one of them, Raniganj East, is currently operational. The others include Rajmahal in Jharkhand, Talcher and Ib Valley in Odisha and Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. The 5 blocks possess an estimated 10 trillion cubic feet (CBF) of CBM reserves.

<doc id="794229" wikidata="Q463396" url="?curid=794229" title="American Association of Petroleum Geologists">
<text>The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) is one of the world&#x27;s largest professional geological societies with about 17,000 members across 129 countries. The AAPG works to &quot;advance the science of geology, especially as it relates to petroleum, natural gas, other subsurface fluids, and mineral resources; to promote the technology of exploring for, finding, and producing these materials in an economically and environmentally sound manner; and to advance the professional well-being of its members.&quot; The AAPG was founded in 1917 and is headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma; currently almost one-third of its members live outside the United States.

Over the years, the activities of the AAPG have broadened so that they bring together not just geology but also geophysics, geochemistry, engineering, and innovative analytics to enable the more efficient and environmentally-friendly approaches to the development of all earth-based energy sources. New transformative technologies, such as the ability to better characterize reservoirs through imaging and the integration of multiple data sources, are coupled with concerns about the environment. Members and affiliated societies are very much involved in preserving the quality of groundwater, dealing responsibly with produced water, and understanding the mechanisms of induced seismicity. In addition to subsurface investigations, the society supports mapping of the surface and the use of new technologies (UAVs, drones, big data analytics), with the goals of advancing the science and understanding of geological processes.

AAPG publishes the &quot;AAPG Explorer&quot; magazine and &quot;AAPG Bulletin&quot; scientific journal, and co-publishes a scientific journal with the Society of Exploration Geophysicists called &quot;Interpretation&quot;. The organization holds an annual meeting including a technical conference and exhibition, sponsors other conferences and continuing education for members around the world such as ongoing Geosciences Technology Workshops, and provides various other services to its members. The organization also includes divisions focused on particular aspects of the profession. These include the Division of Environmental Geosciences, Division of Professional Affairs, and the Energy and Minerals Division. The association membership has included Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Schmitt, a U.S. astronaut who walked on the Moon.

==Awards==
At its annual conventions and international conferences AAPG recognizes the distinguished contributions in the field of petroleum geosciences with various awards, including the Sidney Powers Memorial Award, Michel T. Halbouty Outstanding Leadership Award, Grover E. Murray Memorial Distinguished Educator Award, Wallace Pratt Memorial Award, and Ziad Rafiq Beydoun Memorial Award. The AAPG IBA award is given immediately following the IBA competition that is held at that year&#x27;s annual convention.

===AAPG IBA (Imperial Barrel Award)===
AAPG promotes student involvement in the profession by holding an annual Imperial Barrel Award competition where geoscience graduate students are encouraged to explore a career in the energy industry. In this global competition, university teams analyze a dataset (geology, geophysics, land, production infrastructure, and other relevant materials) and deliver their results in a 25-minute presentation. The students&#x27; presentations are judged by industry experts, providing the students a real-world, career-development experience.

IBA offers students and their faculty advisor a chance to win accolades for themselves and cash prizes for their schools, and winning teams travel free to the annual AAPG convention to network with both future colleagues and future employers.

==Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America==
The Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America (COSUNA) was a project of the AAPG which resulted in the publication of sixteen correlation charts depicting modern concepts of the stratigraphy of North America.

==Pioneering positions==
The AAPG has supported the investigation of the earth, and over the years, ideas about how oil is formed have changed. In the 1960s, the AAPG supported the then-revolutionary idea of plate tectonics (vs. isostasy), and looked at plate tectonics as a key to the evolution of basins, and thus the formation of oil and gas. An example is Tanya Atwater&#x27;s work on plate tectonics. As a whole, women geoscientists have played an important role in the AAPG&#x27;s 100-year history as scientists and leaders.

Since that time, the AAPG has worked closely with scientific organizations such as the USGS to apply new scientific breakthroughs to the generation, migration, and entrapment of oil and gas. The results have brought new understanding of ultra-deepwater reservoirs (such as off the coast of Brazil). Further understanding about kerogen typing and natural fracture development led to a better understanding of shale resources, and contributed to the &quot;shale revolution.&quot; In addition, the AAPG has looked closely at the role of independent oil companies in the roll-out of new technologies used in new types of plays such as shales.

The AAPG has supported geomechanics in order to be able to predict pore pressure and avoid drilling hazards. The AAPG has also been supportive of investigations having to do with the impact of policies of disposing of produced water by injecting it into deep formations. Workshops and forums have been held since 2009 (Geosciences Technology Workshops) to analyze the problems and to discuss solutions. They have been held throughout the world, and are documented through the presentations. The presentations from the workshops have been made available for free via the AAPG&#x27;s open access online journal, Search and Discovery.

==Global warming controversy==

In 2006, the AAPG was criticized for selecting author Michael Crichton for their Journalism Award for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;for his recent science-based thriller &quot;State of Fear&quot;&quot;, in which Crichton exposed his rejection of scientific evidence for anthropogenic global warming. Daniel P. Schrag, a geochemist who directs the Harvard University Center for the Environment, called the award &quot;a total embarrassment&quot; that he said &quot;reflects the politics of the oil industry and a lack of professionalism&quot; on the association&#x27;s part. The AAPG&#x27;s award for journalism lauded &quot;notable journalistic achievement, in any medium, which contributes to public understanding of geology, energy resources or the technology of oil and gas exploration.&quot; The name of the journalism award has since been changed to the &quot;Geosciences in the Media&quot; Award.

The criticism drew attention to the AAPG&#x27;s 1999 position statement formally rejecting the likelihood of human influence on recent climate. The Council of the American Quaternary Association wrote in a criticism of the award that the &quot;AAPG stands alone among scientific societies in its denial of human-induced effects on global warming.&quot;

As recently as March 2007, articles in the newsletter of the AAPG Division of Professional Affairs stated that &quot;the data does not support human activity as the cause of global warming&quot; and characterize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports as &quot;wildly distorted and politicized.&quot;

===2007 AAPG revised position===
Acknowledging that the association&#x27;s previous policy statement on Climate Change was &quot;not supported by a significant number of our members and prospective members&quot;, AAPG&#x27;s formal stance was reviewed and changed in July 2007.

The new statement formally accepts human activity as at least one contributor to carbon dioxide increase, but does not confirm its link to climate change, saying its members are &quot;divided on the degree of influence that anthropogenic CO2 has&quot; on climate. AAPG also stated support for &quot;research to narrow probabilistic ranges on the effect of anthropogenic CO2 on global climate.&quot;

AAPG also withdrew its earlier criticism of other scientific organizations and research stating, &quot;Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through NAS, AGU, AAAS, and AMS. AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data. These data do not necessarily support the maximum case scenarios forecast in some models.&quot;

==Affiliated organizations==
Organizations may request affiliation with AAPG if they meet a set of criteria including goals compatible with those of AAPG; membership of at least 60% professional geologists with degrees; dissemination of scientific information through publications or meetings; and membership not restricted by region.

<text>Social Alternative () was a coalition of far-right political parties in Italy.

== History ==
The coalition grew from Social Action, which was founded by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini after she left the National Alliance due to their attempts to move away from the party&#x27;s fascist past. The group was committed to a strong Italian nationalism that celebrated and glorified its past, and has been particularly critical of Gianfranco Fini&#x27;s modernisation of the right. The alliance was disbanded in late 2006 and replaced by a new pact between Social Action, New Force, the Social Idea Movement, and the .

== Elections ==
Mussolini united her group with the Social Action for the 2004 European Parliament election, getting 1.23% of the vote and gaining one seat in the European Parliament.

The Tricolour Flame joined the alliance for the 2005 regional elections, only to leave it some months later.

In the 2006 Italian general elections the coalition was a member of the defeated House of Freedoms and won no seats.

<text>Public health law examines the authority of the government at various jurisdictional levels to improve public health, the health of the general population within societal limits and norms. Public health law focuses on the duties of the government to achieve these goals, limits on that power, and the population perspective.

Public health law also focuses on legal issues in public health practice and on the public health effects of legal practice.

== Police power ==
Police power can be defined as the inherent power of a government to exercise reasonable control over persons and property within its jurisdiction in the interest of the general security, health, safety, morals, and welfare except where legally prohibited. These areas perpetuate are employed by governmental agencies. Bioterrorism is a growing focus of this practice area in some jurisdictions; for example, public health lawyers in the United States have worked in the creation of the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act and the Model State Public Health Act.

== Disease and injury prevention ==
This broader area of public health law applies legal tools to public health problems associated with disease and injury. Practitioners apply legislation, regulation, litigation (private enforcement), and international law to public health problems using the law as an instrument of public health. Litigation against tobacco companies in the United States provides an excellent example.

== Public health and individual rights ==
Some research suggests a tension in public health law regarding institutions&#x27; duties to protect public health and their duties to protect individual freedom: the best predictor of support for common public health recommendations such as hand-washing, mask-wearing, and staying at home (to avoid the spread of disease) were people&#x27;s beliefs that we should prevent great harm when doing so doesn&#x27;t cause greater harm, but the best predictor of flouting these public health recommendation was people&#x27;s preferences for liberty over equality. This suggests that public health policymakers may face a dilemma between being perceived as not protecting public health or as not protecting individual liberty. So securing support for public health laws will require a careful appeal to each of these seemingly competing concerns.

<doc id="794249" wikidata="Q19999" url="?curid=794249" title="Louis Bernacchi">
<text>Louis Charles Bernacchi (8 November 1876 – 24 April 1942) was an Australian physicist and astronomer best known for his role in several Antarctic expeditions.

==Early life==

Bernacchi was born in Belgium on 8 November 1876 to Italian parents in one of the communes of Brussels known as Schaerbeek. His father, Diego Bernacchi, established a vineyard on Maria Island in 1884. He was educated in Hobart, Tasmania, at the Hutchins School from May 1889 and finishing at
the school around Easter 1891. He entered the Melbourne Observatory in 1895 where he spent about three years studying magnetism and meteorology. During this period he developed an interest in Antarctic exploration, expressed in letters to the press and by following the proceeding of Antarctic Exploration Committees.

==Polar exploration==

He joined Carstens Borchgrevink&#x27;s Southern Cross expedition (1898–1900) which wintered at Cape Adare, Antarctica, joining the expedition in Christchurch, New Zealand after the previous physicist candidate had been rejected on medical grounds. The expedition was the first to spend the winter on the Antarctic continent (the Belgian Antarctic Expedition having been first to overwinter in 1898) and the first to sledge towards the South Pole. He was awarded the Cuthbert-Peek Grant of the Royal Geographical Society that allowed him to work on the geomagnetic data. He wrote a book about the expedition &quot;To the south polar regions: expedition of 1898–1900&quot; published in 1900. His granddaughter Janet Crawford has edited a version of his diaries from the expedition under the title &quot;That First Antarctic Winter: The story of the Southern Cross Expedition of 1898–1900&quot;.
He was again a physicist on the Discovery expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott (1901–1904). Bernacchi was the only man on this expedition who had previously been to the Antarctic. During the trip, he made extensive magnetic observations. Following the trip, Bernacchi was awarded the Royal Geographical Society and Polar Medals as well as the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Scott was the best man at Bernacchi&#x27;s marriage in 1906.

==Subsequent career==
Following two short expeditions to Africa and the upper Amazon Basin in Peru, Bernacchi made two unsuccessful attempts to run for the House of Commons as a Liberal Party candidate, standing in Widnes in 1910. He also invested in rubber plantations in Malaya, Java and Borneo.

During World War I, he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, the Admiralty in the anti-submarine division, and later with the United States Navy. In 1919, he received both an Order of the British Empire and the United States Navy Cross. Following the war, he returned to his interests in rubber.

He remained active in scientific organisations, most notably the Royal Geographical Society, serving as a council member between 1928 and 1932. Bernacchi planned his own expedition to the Antarctic in 1925, but failed to raise sufficient funds. In 1930, he organised the British Polar Exhibition and helped to organise the Second International Polar Year in 1932.

Bernacchi wrote a number of books on the Antarctic including a biography of Lawrence Oates called &quot;A Very Gallant Gentleman&quot; published in 1933, and &quot;Saga of the Discovery&quot; in 1938. In World War II, he returned to the Royal Naval Reserve Volunteers before his death in 1942.

==Commemoration==
Three landmarks in Antarctica are named after him: Bernacchi Head, on Franklin Island, Cape Bernacchi and Bernacchi Bay, both on the coast of Victoria Land. A species of Antarctic fish, the Trematomus bernacchii was named in his honor.

In 2001, Australia Post issued a postal stamp in honour of the 100th anniversary of Australia&#x27;s involvement in Antarctic exploration. The Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, unveiled sculptures of Bernacchi and fellow explorers at Sullivans Cove.

<text>Jan Theuninck (born 7 June 1954) is a Belgian painter and poet. Although born in Zonnebeke, Belgium, and a native speaker of Dutch, he writes in French and occasionally English. His painting is abstract, falling somewhere between minimalism and monochrome expressionism.

As a painter, he has been influenced by Ellsworth Kelly and Joan Miró. His work in both media is guided by his social and political convictions, dealing with topics such as colonialism old and new, mass and society, and pacifism.

<text>Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink (1 December 186421 April 1934) was a Norwegian polar explorer and a pioneer of Antarctic travel. He inspired Sir Robert Falcon Scott, Sir Ernest Shackleton, Roald Amundsen, and others associated with the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.

Borchgrevink was born and raised in Christiania (now Oslo) as the son of a Norwegian lawyer and an English-born immigrant mother. He began his exploring career in 1894 by joining a Norwegian whaling expedition, during which he became one of the first people to set foot on the Antarctic mainland. This achievement helped him to obtain backing for his &quot;Southern Cross&quot; expedition, which became the first to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland, and the first to visit the Great Ice Barrier since the expedition of Sir James Clark Ross nearly sixty years earlier.

The expedition&#x27;s successes were received with only moderate interest by the publicand by the British geographical establishment, whose attention was by then focused on Scott&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition. Some of Borchgrevink&#x27;s colleagues were critical of his leadership, and his own accounts of the expedition were regarded as journalistic and unreliable.

From 1898 to 1900, Borchgrevink led the British-financed &quot;Southern Cross&quot; expedition. He was one of three scientists in 1902 to report on the aftermath of the Mount Pelée eruption on Martinique. Thereafter he returned to Kristiania, leading a life mainly away from public attention. His pioneering work was subsequently recognised and honoured by several countries, and in 1912 he received a tribute from Roald Amundsen, leader of the first expedition to reach the South Pole.

In 1930, the Royal Geographical Society acknowledged Borchgrevink&#x27;s contribution to polar exploration and awarded him its Patron&#x27;s Medal. The Society acknowledged in its citation that justice had not previously been done to the work of the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; expedition.

== Early life ==
Carsten Borchgrevink was born in Christiania on 1 December 1864, the son of a Norwegian lawyer, Henrik Christian Borchgrevink, and an English-born mother Annie, née Ridley. The Borchgrevink family has distant Dutch roots and immigrated to Denmark in the 16th century and Norway in the late 17th century. The family lived in the Uranienborg neighbourhood, where Roald Amundsen, an occasional childhood playmate, also grew up. Borchgrevink was educated at Gjertsen College, Oslo, and later (1885–1888) at the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry at Tharandt, Saxony, in Germany.

According to the historian Roland Huntford, Borchgrevink had a restless nature, with a passion for adventure which took him, after his forestry training, to Australia. For four years he worked with government surveying teams in Queensland and New South Wales before settling in the small town of Bowenfels, where he became a teacher in languages and natural sciences at Cooerwull Academy. His initial interest in polar exploration developed from reading press reports about the work of local scientists on the first Australian Antarctic Exploration Committee. This organisation, founded in 1886, was investigating the possibility of establishing permanent scientific research stations in the Antarctic regions. These plans were not realised; it was a revival of interest in commercial whaling in the early 1890s that gave Borchgrevink the opportunity, in 1894, to sign up for a Norwegian expedition to Antarctica.

== Whaling voyage ==
The expedition that Borchgrevink joined was organised by Henryk Bull, a Norwegian businessman and entrepreneur who, like Borchgrevink, had settled in Australia in the late 1880s. Bull planned to make a sealing and whaling voyage into Antarctic waters; after failing to interest Melbourne&#x27;s learned societies in a cost-sharing venture of a commercial–scientific nature, he returned to Norway to organise his expedition there. He met Svend Foyn, the 84-year-old &quot;father of modern whaling&quot; and inventor of the harpoon gun. With Foyn&#x27;s help he acquired the whaler &quot;Kap Nor&quot; (&quot;North Cape&quot;), which he renamed &quot;Antarctic&quot;. A Mr Sanne was appointed captain initially but was quickly replaced by Leonard Kristensen. The ship sailed left Norway in September 1893.
 When Borchgrevink learned that &quot;Antarctic&quot; was due to visit Melbourne in September 1894, he hurried there hoping to find a vacancy. He was fortunate; William Speirs Bruce, later an Antarctic expedition leader in his own right, had intended to join Bull&#x27;s expedition as a natural scientist but could not reach the ship before it left Norway. This created an opening for Borchgrevink, who met Bull in Melbourne and persuaded him to take him on as a deck-hand and part-time scientist.
During the following months, &quot;Antarctic&#x27;s&quot; sealing activities around the subantarctic islands were successful, but whales proved difficult to find. Bull and Kristensen decided to take the ship further south, to areas where the presence of whales had been reported by earlier expeditions. The ship penetrated a belt of pack ice and sailed into the Ross Sea, but whales were still elusive. On 17 January 1895, a landing was made at Possession Island, where Sir James Clark Ross had planted the British flag in 1841. Bull and Borchgrevink left a message in a canister to prove their presence there. On the island Borchgrevink found a lichen, the first plant life discovered south of the Antarctic Circle.

On 24 January, the ship reached the vicinity of Cape Adare, at the northern extremity of the Victoria Land coastline of the Antarctic mainland. Ross&#x27;s 1841 expedition been unable to land here, but as &quot;Antarctic&quot; neared the cape, conditions were calm enough for a boat to be lowered. A party including Bull, Kristensen, Borchgrevink and others then headed for a shingled foreshore below the cape. Exactly who went ashore first was disputed, between Kristensen, Borchgrevink, and a 17-year-old New Zealand seaman, Alexander von Tunzelmann, who said that he had &quot;leapt out to hold the boat steady&quot;. The party claimed this was the first landing on the Antarctic mainland, although they may have been preceded by the Anglo-American sealing captain John Davis, on the Antarctic Peninsula on 7 February 1821, or by other whaling expeditions.

While ashore at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink collected further specimens of rocks and lichens, the latter of which were of great interest to the scientific community, which had doubted the ability of vegetation to survive so far south. He also made a careful study of the foreshore, assessing its potential as a site where a future expedition might land and establish winter quarters. When &quot;Antarctic&quot; reached Melbourne, Bull and Borchgrevink left the ship. Each hoped to raise funds for a further Antarctic expedition, but their efforts were unsuccessful. An animosity developed between them, possibly because of their differing accounts of the voyage on the &quot;Antarctic&quot;; each emphasised his own role without fully acknowledging that of the other.

== Making plans ==
=== International Geographical Congress 1895 ===
To promote his developing ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 he addressed the conference, giving an account of the Cape Adare foreshore as a place where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter. He described the site as &quot;a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions&quot;, and said there were indications that in this place &quot;the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers&quot;. He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy routea &quot;gentle slope&quot;. He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself.

Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: &quot;His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration&quot;. The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink&#x27;s ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that &quot;the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century&quot;.

=== Seeking support ===

For the next two years Borchgrevink travelled in Europe and in Australia, seeking support and backing for his expedition ideas without success. One of those with whom he sought to join forces was William Speirs Bruce, who was planning his own Antarctic expedition. Their joint plans foundered when Borchgrevink, who had severed relations with Henryk Bull, learned that Bruce was in discussions with him; &quot;I regret therefore that we cannot collaborate,&quot; wrote Borchgrevink to Bruce. He also discovered that the Royal Geographical Society had been planning its own Antarctic expedition since 1893.

Under the influence of its president, Sir Clements Markham, this RGS project was envisaged not only as a scientific endeavour, but as an attempt to relive the former glories of Royal Naval polar exploration. This vision would eventually develop into the National Antarctic Expedition with the , under Robert Falcon Scott, and it was this that attracted the interest of the learned societies rather than Borchgrevink&#x27;s more modest proposals. Markham was fiercely opposed to private ventures that might divert financial support from his project, and Borchgrevink found himself starved of practical help: &quot;It was up a steep hill,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that I had to roll my Antarctic boulder.&quot;

=== Sir George Newnes ===
During his search for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British magazine publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;, &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;, &quot;Country Life&quot; and the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;. It was not unusual for publishers to support explorationNewnes&#x27;s great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson&#x27;s expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expeditionaround £40,000 (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed ought to have been theirs. Markham maintained an attitude of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.

Newnes stipulated that the expedition should sail under a British flag, and should be styled the &quot;British Antarctic Expedition&quot;. In the end, of the total party of 29, only two were British, with one Australian and the rest Norwegian. Despite this, Borchgrevink took steps to emphasise the expedition&#x27;s British character, flying the personal flag of the Duke of York and taking 500 bamboo poles with miniature Union Jacks for, as he put it, &quot;purpose of survey and extension of the British Empire&quot;.

== Southern Cross Expedition ==
=== Winter in Antarctica ===
With funding assured, Borchgrevink purchased the whaling ship &quot;Pollux&quot;, renamed her , and had her fitted out for Antarctic service. &quot;Southern Cross&quot; sailed from London on 22 August 1898, and after a three-week pause in Hobart, Tasmania, reached Cape Adare on 17 February 1899. Here, on the site which Borchgrevink had described to the Congress, the expedition set up the first shore base on the Antarctic continent, in the midst of a penguin colony. It was named &quot;Camp Ridley&quot; in honour of Borchgrevink&#x27;s mother.

In 1901, Borchgrevink published the book &quot;First on the Antarctic Continent&quot;. He wrote in a chapter dedicated to Adélie penguins: &quot;We all watched the life of the penguins with the utmost interest, and I believe and hope that some of us learnt something from their habits and characteristics.&quot; On 2 March, the ship departed for New Zealand to winter there, leaving a shore party of ten men with their provisions, equipment and seventy dogs. These were the first dogs brought to the Antarctic; likewise, the expedition pioneered the use of the Primus stove, invented in Sweden six years earlier.

Louis Bernacchi, the party&#x27;s Australian physicist, was later to write: &quot;In many respects, Borchgrevink was not a good leader&quot;. Borchgrevink was evidently no autocrat but, Bernacchi said, without the framework of an accepted hierarchy a state of &quot;democratic anarchy&quot; prevailed, with &quot;dirt, disorder and inactivity the order of the day&quot;. Furthermore, as winter developed, Borchgrevink&#x27;s hopes that Cape Adare would escape the worst Antarctic weather proved false; he had chosen a site which was particularly exposed to the freezing winds blown northwards from the inland ice. As time progressed, tempers wore thin; the party became irritable and boredom set in.

There were accidents: a candle left burning caused extensive fire damage, and on another occasion several members of the party were almost asphyxiated by fumes from the stove. Borchgrevink attempted to establish a routine, and scientific work was carried on throughout, but as he wrote himself, referring to the general lack of fellowship: &quot;The silence roars in one&#x27;s ears&quot;. Further lowering the group&#x27;s spirits, their Norwegian zoologist, Nicolai Hanson, fell ill, failed to respond to treatment, and died on 14 October 1899.

When the southern winter ended and sledging activity became possible, Borchgrevink&#x27;s assumptions about an easy route to the interior were shattered; the glaciated mountain ranges adjoining Cape Adare precluded any travel inland, restricting exploration to the immediate area around the cape. Borchgrevink&#x27;s basic expedition planto overwinter on the Antarctic continent and carry out scientific observations therehad been achieved. When &quot;Southern Cross&quot; returned at the end of January 1900, Borchgrevink decided to abandon the camp, although there were sufficient fuel and provisions left to last another year.

Instead of returning home directly, &quot;Southern Cross&quot; sailed south until it reached the Great Ice Barrier, discovered by Sir James Clark Ross during his 1839–1843 voyage and later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf in his honour. No one had visited the Barrier since, and Ross had been unable to land. Borchgrevink discovered an inlet in the Barrier edge; this was later named the &quot;Bay of Whales&quot; by Shackleton. Here, on 16 February 1900, Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and the Sami dog-handler, Per Savio, made the first landing on the Barrier and, with dogs and sledges, travelled south to set a new Farthest South record at 78°50′. &quot;Southern Cross&quot; visited other Ross Sea islands before turning for home, reaching New Zealand on 1 April 1900. Borchgrevink then took a steamer to England, arriving early in June.

=== Return and reception ===

The reception afforded to the expedition on its return to England was lukewarm. Public interest and attention was fixed on the forthcoming national expedition of which Robert Falcon Scott had just been appointed commander, rather than on a venture which was considered British only in name.

In spite of the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; expedition&#x27;s achievements, there was still resentment in geographical circlesharboured especially by Sir Clements Markhamabout Borchgrevink&#x27;s acceptance of Newnes&#x27;s gift. Also, Bruce complained that Borchgrevink had appropriated plans that he had developed but been forced to abandon. Borchgrevink&#x27;s credibility was not helped by the boastful tone sounded in various articles which were published in Newnes&#x27;s magazines, nor by the journalistic style of his rapidly written expedition account, &quot;First on the Antarctic Continent&quot;, the English edition of which appeared in 1901.

In hailing his expedition as a great success, Borchgrevink spoke of &quot;another Klondyke&quot;, an abundance of fish, seals and birds, and of &quot;quartz, in which metals are to be seen&quot;. In his book, he listed the expedition&#x27;s main achievements: proof that an expedition could live on Victoria Land over winter; a year&#x27;s continuous magnetic and meteorological observations; an estimate of the current position of the south magnetic pole; discoveries of new species of insects and shallow-water fauna; coastal mapping and the discovery of new islands; the first landing on Ross Island and, finally, scaling the Great Ice Barrier and sledging to &quot;the furthest south ever reached by man&quot;.

Other commentators have observed that the choice of the winter site at Cape Adare had ruled out any serious geographical exploration of the Antarctic interior. The scientific results of the expedition were less than had been anticipated, due in part to the loss of some of Nicolai Hanson&#x27;s natural history notes; Borchgrevink may have been responsible for this loss; He was later involved in a dispute with Hanson&#x27;s former employers, Natural History Museum, London, over these missing notes and other specimens collected by Hanson.

Following his return Borchgrevink was honoured by the American Geographical Society, and was made a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav by King Oscar II. He received honours from Denmark and Austria, but in England his work was for many years largely disregarded, despite Mill&#x27;s acknowledgement of &quot;a dashing piece of pioneer work, useful in training men for later service&quot;. The historian David Crane suggests that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, England would have taken his achievements more seriously.

== Post-expedition life ==
=== Mount Pelée disaster ===
In 1902, Borchgrevink was one of three geographers invited by the National Geographic Society (NGS) to report on the after-effects of the catastrophic eruptions of Mount Pelée, on the French-Caribbean island of Martinique. These eruptions, in May 1902, had destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre, with enormous loss of life. Borchgrevink visited the island in June, when the main volcanic activity had subsided, and found the mountain &quot;perfectly quiet&quot;, and the islanders recovered from their panic. He did not think that Saint-Pierre would ever be inhabited again. He reported a narrow escape when, at the foot of the mountain, a jet of steam came out of the ground over which he and his party had just passed: &quot;If it had struck any one of us we would have been scalded to death.&quot; He later presented his report to the NGS in Washington, 
although it is unclear if he did that. His account of the Mt Pelee eruption published in &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Monthly&quot; drew sharp criticism in the &quot;Science&quot; journal from expert Edmund Otis Hovey.

=== Retirement ===
On his return from Washington, Borchgrevink retired into private life. On 7 September 1896, he had married an English woman, Constance Prior Standen, with whom he settled in Slemdal, in Oslo, where two sons and two daughters were born. Borchgrevink devoted himself mainly to sporting and literary activities, producing a book entitled &quot;The Game of Norway&quot;. On two occasions he apparently considered returning to the Antarctic; in August 1902 he stated his intention to lead a new Antarctic expedition for the NGS, but nothing came of this, and a later venture, announced in Berlin in 1909, was likewise unfulfilled.

Although he remained out of the limelight, Borchgrevink retained his interest in Antarctic matters, visiting Scott shortly before the sailed on Scott&#x27;s last expedition in June 1910. When news of Scott&#x27;s death reached the outside world, Borchgrevink paid tribute: &quot;He was the first in the field with a finely organised expedition and the first who did systematic work on the great south polar continent.&quot; In a letter of condolence to John Scott Keltie, the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s secretary, Borchgrevink said of Scott: &quot;He was a man!&quot;

In Norway differing assessments of Borchgrevink were made by the country&#x27;s polar elite: Roald Amundsen was a long-time friend and supporter, whereas Fridtjof Nansen, according to Scott, spoke of him as a &quot;tremendous fraud&quot;. When Amundsen returned from his South Pole conquest in 1912, he paid full tribute to Borchgrevink&#x27;s pioneering work: &quot;We must acknowledge that in ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed.&quot;

During his later years Borchgrevink lived quietly. In 1929 the Parliament of Norway awarded him a pension of three thousand Norwegian kroner. In 1930 came belated recognition from Londonthe Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Patron&#x27;s Medal, proclaiming that the magnitude of the difficulties overcome by Borchgrevink had initially been underestimated: &quot;It was only after the work of Scott&#x27;s Northern Party... that we were able to realise the improbability that any explorer could do more in the Cape Adare district than Mr Borchgrevink had accomplished. It appeared, then, that justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition, which had been carried out under the British flag and at the expense of a British benefactor.&quot;

== Death and commemoration ==

Carsten Borchgrevink died in Oslo on 21 April 1934. Despite what one biographer describes as his obsessive desire to be first, and his limited formal scientific training, he has been acknowledged as a pioneer in Antarctic work and as a forerunner of later, more elaborate expeditions. Several geographical features in Antarctica commemorate his name, including the Borchgrevink Coast of Victoria Land, between Cape Adare and Cape Washington, the Borchgrevink Glacier in Victoria Land, and the Borchgrevinkisen glacier in Queen Maud Land. His name is also carried by the small Antarctic fish &quot;Pagothenia borchgrevinki&quot; and by the extinct arthropod &quot;Borchgrevinkium taimyrensis&quot;. His expedition&#x27;s accommodation hut remains at Cape Adare, under the care of The New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust which acts as guardian to this hut and to those of Scott and Shackleton elsewhere on the continent. The Borchgrevink hut was designated by the Trust as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 159 in 2002. In June 2005 the Trust adopted a management plan for its future maintenance and accessibility.

<doc id="794266" wikidata="Q2421018" url="?curid=794266" title="Semple Stadium">
<text>FBD Semple Stadium is the home of hurling and Gaelic football for Tipperary GAA and for the province of Munster. Located in Thurles, County Tipperary, it is the second largest GAA stadium in Ireland (after Croke Park), with a capacity of 45,690 and named after Tom Semple, the captain of the Thurles &quot;Blues&quot;. He won All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medals in 1900, 1906 and 1908.

The stadium is the leading venue for Munster hurling followers, having hosted the Munster Hurling Final on many memorable occasions.

==Facilities==

The main or &#x27;Old Stand&#x27; of the ground (also known as the &#x27;Ardán Ó Coinneáin&#x27; or &#x27;Dr Kinane Stand&#x27; named after Jeremiah Kinane) lies across from the &#x27;New Stand&#x27; (also known as the &#x27;Ardán Ó Riáin&#x27;) both of which are covered. Behind the goals are two uncovered terraces known as the &#x27;Town End&#x27; (also known as the &#x27;Davin Terrace&#x27;) and the &#x27;Killinan End&#x27; (also known as the &#x27;Maher Terrace&#x27;) respectively.

Currently the stadium has a capacity of 45,690 of which 24,000 are seated.

===The Dome===
The sports hall accommodates a full-sized basketball court suitable for national standard competition. The hall is also lined for badminton, volleyball, and indoor soccer. It is used in the evenings and weekends by the Tipperary hurling and football teams for training and on match days, the building is used to accommodate GAA and sponsor guests for corporate lunches and functions. It has also been used as a music venue.

===Proposed development===
In July 2018 Tipperary County Board prepared to submit plans to Tipperary County Council to see the Kinane stand redeveloped into a multi-purpose facility.

The proposal would see the &quot;Old Stand&quot; as it is known to many, have a second level created over the concourse at the back of the stand. The half nearest the Killinan End terrace will be dedicated to players and will include a full-sized gym, physio room, stats/analysis room plus changing rooms and toilet facilities. The other half, towards the Sarsfields Centre side, would include a function room to accommodate up to 250 people, with adjoining bar and kitchen facility for catering. The development will also include a new corridor leading to a new VIP enclosure area in the Kinnane stand. The estimated cost of the project is €5 million.

The planning application for the development was lodged with Tipperary County Council in April 2019. The planning application included reconfiguration of the seating area and modifications to the ground floor, including turnstiles, the construction of a new exit gate, and three service cores providing access to upper floor levels, which would include wheelchair-accessible turnstiles. Wilson Architecture in Cork was commissioned to help put together the planning application. Planning permission was granted in April 2020.

==History==

The grounds on which Semple Stadium is built were formerly known as Thurles Sportsfield. The site was offered for sale in 1910 at the wish of Canon M.K. Ryan and was purchased by local Gaelic games enthusiasts for £900. To meet the cost of the purchase, an issue of shares was subscribed by the townspeople. The grounds remained in the hands of the shareholders until 1956 when they were transferred to the Gaelic Athletic Association.

In 1934 in anticipation of the All-Ireland Hurling Final being held in the grounds to mark the golden jubilee of the Association, extensive improvements were made to bring the field requirements up to the demands which a crowd of up to 60,000 would make. The embankments around the field were raised and extended and the stand accommodation was also extended. However, the jubilee final was held in Croke Park and it was another 50 years before the stadium would host the All-Ireland final as a showpiece to mark the centenary.

In 1968 further developments took place when the Dr. Kinane Stand was completed and opened. In 1971 the stadium was named after Tom Semple, who was captain of the Thurles &quot;Blues&quot;. He won All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medals in 1900, 1906 and 1908. The Ardán Ó Riáin opposite the Kinane Stand and the terracing at the town end of the field were completed in 1981 at a cost of £500,000. This development and the terracing at the Killinan end of the field were part of a major improvement scheme for the celebration of the centenary All-Ireland Hurling Final between Cork and Offaly in 1984.

Dublin v Kerry in the quarter-finals of the 2001 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship was held at Semple Stadium.

In April 2006 Tipperary County Board announced an €18 million redevelopment plan for the Stadium. The three-year project aimed to boost capacity to over 55,000, as well as providing a wide range of modern facilities such as corporate space concessions, dining and changing areas within both main stands. There were also plans to upgrade the standing terraces and install a modern floodlighting facility. Phase one of the upgrade project, upgrading the Kinnane Stand side of the stadium, involved expenditure of €5.5 million.

On 14 February 2009 the new state of the art floodlights were switched on by GAA President Nickey Brennan before the National Hurling League game against Cork.

In 2016, Hawk-Eye was installed in the stadium and used for the first time during the Munster Championship quarter-final between Tipperary and Cork.

After 28 minutes of play in a 2022 Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship game for Clonoulty–Rossmore against Kilruane at Semple Stadium, Dillon Quirke collapsed and died.

An architectural consultancy has been appointed to lead a design team, tasked with preparing a master plan for the redevelopment of Semple Stadium.

===Music festival===

The Féile Festival, ran from 1990 to 1994 (and returned in 1997 for one day), was held at Semple Stadium. At the height of its success, an estimated 150,000 people attended the festival, which was also known as &quot;The Trip to Tipp&quot;. Irish and international artists participated, including The Prodigy, The Cranberries, Blur, Bryan Adams, Van Morrison, Rage Against the Machine, The Saw Doctors and Christy Moore.

The Féile Classical Concerts took place at Semple Stadium in September 2018. Line up included Irish musical acts that played in the 1990s at the Féile festivals. Named as Tipp Classical, it will return in September 2019.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Semple Stadium is a five-minute walk from Thurles railway station. The station is on the Dublin to Cork main rail line with connections to Limerick and Tralee lines. Irish Rail operates &#x27;GAA Specials&#x27; to the station on the date of certain matches at Semple stadium.

==Naming rights==
In 2022, FBD Insurance entered into a naming rights agreement which provided for the stadium to be referred to as &quot;FBD Semple Stadium&quot;.

<doc id="794270" wikidata="Q1766116" url="?curid=794270" title="Páirc Uí Chaoimh">
<text>Páirc Uí Chaoimh ( ) is a Gaelic games stadium in Cork, Ireland. Often referred to simply as &quot;The Park&quot;, it is the home of Cork GAA and is located in Ballintemple, near the site of the original Cork Athletic Grounds. In February 2024, following a naming-rights agreement with SuperValu, the venue was branded as SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. The stadium opened in 1976 and underwent a significant two-year redevelopment before reopening in 2017.

Primarily used as a venue for Gaelic games, it has been used to host Cork&#x27;s home league and championship games in both Gaelic football and hurling. The finals of both the Cork hurling and football championships have often been held at the venue. Following approval by the GAA&#x27;s Central Council, soccer and rugby games have also been hosted.

The stadium has also hosted concerts by Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Prince, U2, The Stone Roses, Oasis, Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Westlife as well as the annual Siamsa Cois Laoi festival.

Originally designed by Horgan and Lynch, the stadium had an initial capacity of 50,288. This capacity was progressively reduced because of safety regulations and, before the commencement of redevelopment works in 2015, it had a capacity of 32,550. Since the completion of the redevelopment in 2017 the capacity of the venue is 45,000, making it the third-largest Gaelic games stadium in Ireland.

==History==

===Early ground===

Sports meetings were frequently held on the area now occupied by Páirc Uí Chaoimh even before the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association. By the late 1890s the Cork County Board were allowed by the Cork Agricultural Company, the leaseholders of the land, to enclose a portion of the site for the playing of Gaelic Games. The county board built its own stadium on the land in 1898. The Cork Athletic Grounds opened in 1904 and hosted All-Ireland finals, Munster finals and National League games. These grounds were close to what is now the CAB Ford garage on the Monahan Road.

By the 1960s, the Cork Athletic Grounds did not serve the needs of the modern era, and the ground&#x27;s facilities were described as &quot;primitive&quot; by some contemporary commentators. In 1963 the county board bought some land at Model Farm Road, on the western side of the city, as the site for a new development. It was envisaged that this new stadium would hold up to 70,000 spectators and provide more modern facilities. However, problems arose and the project was abandoned.

===Development===
In 1972 it was decided to redevelop the Athletic Grounds as an alternative, and additional land was acquired from the Munster Agricultural Society, whose premises adjoined the Athletic Grounds. The new stadium area covered almost 9 acres, with works undertaken by HMC Construction Ltd. Work began in April 1974, though details of the new stadium &quot;of the most modern design and facilities&quot; weren&#x27;t unveiled until a press conference took place in the Imperial Hotel, Cork on 26 July 1974. The new stadium was estimated to cost approximately £1 million, but ultimately overran to £1.7 million.

Known as Páirc Uí Chaoimh, in commemoration of the late general-secretary of the GAA, Pádraig Ó Caoimh, the stadium was to have a capacity of 50,288. Designed by the Cork city firm of consultant engineers, Horgan and Lynch, Páirc Uí Chaoimh was designed to have seating for 19,688 spectators, half of which would be under cover on the southern side of the ground. Long-term plans envisaged the extension of the stand all around the stadium. Included underneath the stadium structure were a number of facilities, all served by the main circulation tunnel.

===Finance===
The Cork County Board were faced with a bill of £650,000 to cover the first stage of the development, which at the time was the biggest undertaken by any sports organisation in Ireland. In addition to grants from the GAA&#x27;s Central and Munster Councils, finance for the project was raised by the sale of the Board&#x27;s 45 acre property at Model Farm Road, and a sizeable part of 49 acres on the north side of the city. The Board&#x27;s offices on Cook Street were also sold, while further funds were raised through Coiste Gael and commercial and private subscriptions. Additional funds were raised through the sale of 88 advertising spaces within the stadium and the sale of 3,000 five-year stand tickets at £30 each.

===Official opening===

Páirc Uí Chaoimh was officially opened on 6 June 1976. by Con Murphy, then president of the GAA. On the opening day the Cork hurlers played Kilkenny while the Cork footballers took on Kerry.

===Concerts===
The 1970s oil shocks increased interest rates and the Cork County Board was unable to repay the loan on stadium&#x27;s building cost. Local promoter Oliver Barry instigated the , a weekend festival of country, folk, and Irish traditional music held annually in the stadium from 1977 to 1987. Opposition from GAA traditionalists was overcome by the need for the organisation to clear mounting debts. Each &quot;Siamsa &quot; programme featured international stars supported by Irish acts. Headliners included 
Glen Campbell (1979 
and 1983), 
Don McLean (1979 
and 1984), 
Joan Baez (1980),
Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle,
Leo Sayer (1984), 
Loudon Wainwright III (1985), 
Kris Kristofferson (1985), 
John Denver (1986),
Status Quo, 
and The Pogues (1987). Support included acts managed by Barry like the Wolfe Tones, Stockton&#x27;s Wing, and Bagatelle, and others including the Dubliners and Christy Moore.

U2 played the final show on the European leg of the Joshua Tree Tour at the stadium in August 1987. The U2 concert established the venue&#x27;s credibility with pop and rock acts. On 30 and 31 July 1988, Michael Jackson performed at the stadium twice as part of his Bad World Tour, with a combined attendance of in excess of 130,000. The County Board&#x27;s share of ticket sales funded the purchase of Christy Ring Park. Páirc Uí Chaoimh was also the venue for Prince&#x27;s first ever Irish concert on 7 July 1990, as part of his Nude Tour. U2 played again at the stadium on 24 August 1993 on their ZooTv Tour. 1995 saw the Féile Festival being transferred to Cork for one year, with the line-up including Ash, The Stone Roses, Paul Weller and Kylie Minogue. Oasis then performed two nights at the stadium in August 1996. Bruce Springsteen played at the stadium in July 2013 and again in May 2024.

The first concerts of the redeveloped stadium were the opening concerts of Ed Sheeran&#x27;s ÷ Tour over three nights in May 2018. Sheeran also returned for two nights in April 2023 as part of his +–=÷× Tour. Elton John hosted part of his Farewell Yellow Brick Tour at the venue on 1 July 2022.

===Improvements===
In 2005, the Cork County Board replaced all wood bench seats with plastic bucket seats in the covered and open stands. Due to the shape of the new bucket seats, overall legroom was reduced, with many complaining of being unable to sit in the seat entirely. In response, the tops were cut off the back of each seat, marginally improving legroom.

In October 2007, plans were announced which proposed to redevelop Páirc Uí Chaoimh into a 60,000-seat sports and concert venue in conjunction with the Cork Docklands redevelopment which was estimated to cost over €30m. If these plans had gone ahead, Cork would have had the second largest stadium in the country behind Croke Park. This specific plan was not progressed.

===Association football===
On 25 September 2018, the stadium hosted association football for the first time, a benefit match for Cork-born Ireland international Liam Miller, who died of cancer aged 36 that February. A Manchester United legends team defeated a Republic of Ireland/Celtic legends team 3–2 on penalties after the match had finished 2–2 after 90 minutes. The official attendance for the match was 42,878. Juvenile Gaelic football and hurling exhibition games took place at half time, involving the team that Miller himself represented as a boy, Éire Óg.

The first international football match to take place at Páirc Uí Chaoimh was a UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2025 qualifier between the Republic of Ireland and France. The Republic of Ireland won 3-1, with Cork native Denise O&#x27;Sullivan becoming the first player to score an international goal at the stadium. On 18 September 2024, after the UK Government announced it would not provide the additional funding required for the redevelopment of Casement Park for UEFA Euro 2028 the Irish Government pushed for Páirc Uí Chaoimh to be an alternative option to host games originally scheduled to be held in Belfast, the proposal was supported by the GAA.

===Rugby union===
Páirc Uí Chaoimh hosted its first rugby match on 10 November 2022, breaking the record for the most spectators at a rugby match in Munster with 41,400 in attendance. In the game, Munster beat a touring South Africa A side 28 to 14.

The stadium also hosted a game between New Zealand rugby union side Crusaders and Munster on 3 February 2024. Munster defeated Crusaders, by 21 to 19, in front of a &quot;capacity&quot; crowd of 40,885.

===Sponsorship===
In early 2024, it was reported that the Cork County Board and Musgrave Group had agreed a three-year naming rights deal, to refer to the stadium as &quot;SuperValu Páirc&quot;. With criticism from some commentators (including as the proposed name dropped the &quot;name of the man [..] after whom Páirc Uí Chaoimh was named&quot;), as of 17 January the board stated that &quot;no final decision has been taken&quot; on the proposed name. As a compromise, &quot;SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh&quot; was subsequently proposed as a sponsorship name, and ratified by county committee delegates on 1 February 2024.

==Redevelopment==
===Plans===
In June 2010, Cork City Council voted in favour of the proposal to make of land next to Páirc Uí Chaoimh available for the redevelopment of the stadium. As part of the redevelopment, a new &#x27;Centre of Excellence&#x27; was also planned, with an ancillary all-weather pitch, floodlights, 1,000 seat stand, gym and changing and medical facilities. A museum was also proposed, with dining facilities and a 400-space car park.

The stadium plans expected a small increase in capacity, with the new development accommodating 45,000 when completed. The development had been subject to local opposition as some residents complained that land used for the redevelopment had been earmarked for a public park. With Cork&#x27;s average attendance not breaking 20,000 in 2011, there were also questions about the need for such a big venue, including by the Munster Council Secretary Pat Fitzgerald.

The redevelopment plans proposed stand capacities as follows:
*New 3-tier South Stand (covered) 13,000 seats (up from its previous level of 9,435) 
*Refurbished North stand (covered) 8,000 seats (down from its previous level of 10,030)
*Refurbished East and West Terrace 12,000 capacity each (uncovered)

In summer 2013, it was announced that an application was being lodged to redevelop the stadium, but due to financial difficulties the project was put on hold.

===Demolition and construction works===

In April 2014, Cork County Board and Cork City Council announced that they had been given the green light to proceed with the redevelopment project of the stadium. 
In May 2014, the Government sanctioned a €30 million grant to help fund the regeneration of the stadium. 
The work was due to start in summer 2014, and on 6 July 2014, the stadium hosted its last provincial football final in the old stadium with rivals Kerry running out comfortable winners 0–24 to Cork 0–12.
It also hosted the 2014 Munster Senior Hurling Championship Final on 13 July 2014, with Cork beating rivals Limerick, 2–24 to 0–24, the final inter county game before demolition took place.
In November 2014 An Bord Pleanala gave the green light to redevelop the stadium with redevelopment works running from January 2015 to mid-2017.

===Reopening===
It had been planned to hold the 2017 Munster Senior Hurling and Football finals at the reopened stadium, but construction delays forced these to be relocated. The first match at the re-developed stadium was instead a Cork premier intermediate hurling championship game between Valley Rovers and Blarney on 19 July 2017, which attracted a crowd of 10,749. 
The venue then hosted two 2017 All-Ireland hurling quarter-finals on consecutive days later in July 2017, with combined attendances of more than 64,000. The first of these games, on 22 July 2017, was the first championship match at the re-developed stadium, and saw Tipperary defeat Clare by 0–28 to 3–16. Clare&#x27;s Tony Kelly scored the first point and Aaron Cunningham the first goal at the new stadium.

As of December 2017, the cost of the redevelopment was reportedly €86.4 million (approximately €23m over the planned budget), which included the cost of development of two covered stands, and two uncovered terrace ends. The updated stadium also has four 35-space dressing rooms with under-floor heating, physio, warm-up, drug-testing, referee, and first aid rooms.

By December 2018, stadium commercial director Peter McKenna declared that the final cost of rebuilding Páirc Uí Chaoimh could be as high as €110m, which is €24m higher than the €86m quoted when works were completed in 2017.

In March 2020, the Cork County Board of the GAA confirmed they had made the stadium available to the Health Service Executive for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The stadium is a trailhead for the Cork Harbour Greenway.

==Capacity and records==
Prior to the 2017 redevelopment, the capacity included 9,500 seats in the covered (Sean McCarthy) stand, 10,000 in the uncovered stand, approximately 12,000 in the &quot;Blackrock end&quot; terrace, approximately 12,000 in the &quot;City end&quot; terracing, and 50 in the wheelchair area.

Following the 2017 redevelopment, the main (covered) south stand seats 13,000, the north (covered) stand seats 8,000 and the city and &quot;Blackrock end&quot; terraces each have a capacity of 12,000. The south stand, which has three levels, includes a 2,238-seat premium level.

The record attendance at Páirc Uí Chaoimh was 49,961 for the 1985 Munster Final between Cork and Tipperary. Prior to this, in 1983, Páirc Uí Chaoimh hosted an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final replay in which Cork lost to Dublin. This was only the second time an All-Ireland semi-final had been held outside Croke Park since 1941. The stadium hosted its first rugby match in November 2022, breaking the record for the most spectators at a rugby match in Munster.

<doc id="794278" wikidata="Q1387131" url="?curid=794278" title="Joel Quenneville">
<text>Joel Norman Quenneville (born September 15, 1958) is a Canadian–American ice hockey coach and former player in the National Hockey League (NHL). Nicknamed &quot;Coach Q&quot;, he is second in NHL coaching wins at 969 behind Scotty Bowman. Quenneville achieved his greatest success as head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, a team he coached from 2008 to 2018. He led the Blackhawks to three Stanley Cup titles in 2010, 2013 and 2015. The team&#x27;s championship victory in 2010 was the Blackhawks&#x27; first since 1961, ending the then-longest Stanley Cup drought.

Quenneville also served as the head coach of the St. Louis Blues from 1996 to 2004, the Colorado Avalanche from 2005 to 2008, and the Florida Panthers from 2019 to 2021.

==Playing career==
As a player, Quenneville was drafted 21st overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft. A defenceman, he played for the OHA&#x27;s Windsor Spitfires, the New Brunswick Hawks, Baltimore Skipjacks and St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs of the American Hockey League (AHL), and the Maple Leafs, Colorado Rockies/New Jersey Devils, Hartford Whalers and Washington Capitals of the NHL. He has also been a player/assistant coach of St. John&#x27;s, head coach of the AHL&#x27;s Springfield Indians, and assistant coach of the Quebec Nordiques and Colorado Avalanche.

==Coaching career==

===Colorado Avalanche===
Quenneville won the Stanley Cup as an assistant coach with the Avalanche in 1996.

===St. Louis Blues===
Quenneville then moved to the St. Louis Blues franchise, becoming head coach midway through the next season after Mike Keenan was fired. He led St. Louis to seven straight playoff berths. His best season was in 1999–2000, when he led the Blues to a franchise-record 51 wins and their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy for the league&#x27;s best regular season record. However, they were upset in the playoffs, losing to the San Jose Sharks in the first round. He won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the regular season.

In Quenneville&#x27;s 2004 season with the Blues, the team started poorly and late in the year was in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in a quarter century. As a result, Quenneville was fired.

===Colorado Avalanche (2nd stint)===
Quenneville was hired as head coach by Avalanche in June 2004, before the 2004–05 NHL lockout resulted in the season&#x27;s cancellation. In his first year with the Avalanche, he led the team to the playoffs and a first round upset of the Dallas Stars. On March 25, 2007, Quenneville coached his 750th career game. He became one of only seven currently active coaches to reach 750 games as of the 2006–07 season. Quenneville coached his 400th win on October 26, 2007, a 3–2 overtime game against the Calgary Flames. On May 9, 2008, the Avalanche announced that Quenneville was leaving the organization.

===Chicago Blackhawks===
Quenneville was hired as a pro scout by the Chicago Blackhawks in September 2008.

On October 16, 2008, Quenneville was promoted to head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, replacing former Blackhawk Denis Savard. On December 1, 2009, he received his 500th win as a coach in an 11-round shootout battle against the Columbus Blue Jackets. In his first two seasons with Chicago, he led the team to the 2009 Western Conference Final and the 2010 Stanley Cup Final. With the Blackhawks&#x27; victory over the Philadelphia Flyers in the latter, Quenneville earned his first Stanley Cup as a head coach. On December 18, 2011, he earned his 600th career coaching win, winning 4–2 against the Calgary Flames. Quenneville earned his second championship as a head coach against the Boston Bruins during the 2013 Stanley Cup Final, cementing his status as one of a handful of Chicago head coaches with multiple championships (the others are George Halas of the Chicago Bears, Phil Jackson of the Chicago Bulls, and Frank Chance of the Chicago Cubs). On March 19, 2014, Quenneville became just the third head coach in NHL history to record 700 wins. On March 23, 2015, Quenneville reached 750 wins as a coach.
His team won the Stanley Cup for the third time on June 15, 2015, with a 2–0 shutout over the Tampa Bay Lightning. This was the first Blackhawks&#x27; championship win on home ice since 1938. With his third win, Quenneville became the third coach in Chicago sports history to win three championships, after Halas and Jackson. On January 14, 2016, Quenneville earned his 783rd win, passing Al Arbour for second all-time among NHL coaches. On April 3, 2016, Quenneville earned his 800th win, in a 6–4 victory over the Boston Bruins, and joined Scotty Bowman as the only two coaches with at least 800 wins.

On February 21, 2017, the Blackhawks defeated the Minnesota Wild 5–3, helping Quenneville become the second coach in Blackhawks history to win 400 games. On February 21, 2018, Quenneville became the third coach in NHL history to coach 1,600 games as the Blackhawks won 3–2 over the Ottawa Senators. On March 10, Quenneville coached in his 1,608th regular season game and passed Arbour for second most on NHL all-time games coached list.

On November 6, 2018, the Blackhawks fired Quenneville after a 6–6–3 start in the 2018–19 season. He concluded his tenure in Chicago with a 452–249–96 regular season record, a 76–52 record in the postseason, and as the second winningest coach in NHL history with 890 wins. His 452 wins are second in Blackhawks history behind only Billy Reay, and only Reay had a longer unbroken tenure with the team.

===Florida Panthers===
On April 8, 2019, the Florida Panthers hired Quenneville as head coach. In his first season with the Panthers, Quenneville led the Panthers to a 35–26–8 record in the pandemic-shortened 2019–20 season and the Panthers&#x27; first playoff appearance in four seasons, losing to the New York Islanders in four games in the qualifying round.

In the 2021–22 season, Quenneville led the Panthers to a 7–0–0 record through the team&#x27;s first seven games before his abrupt resignation on October 28, 2021 (see below).

==Controversies==
===2010 Brad Aldrich investigation=== 
On October 26, 2021, an independent investigation into how the Blackhawks responded to claims that former video coach Brad Aldrich sexually assaulted prospect Kyle Beach during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs revealed that Quenneville, as well as several members of the Blackhawks&#x27; senior leadership team, opted to defer any action on Aldrich until after the Stanley Cup Finals.

According to the report, Quenneville was particularly concerned about causing a distraction before the Finals. Three weeks after the allegations were raised, Aldrich was forced to resign by HR and Legal after opting not to comply with their investigation and subsequently pleaded guilty to assaulting a player at a Michigan high school where he was a volunteer coach.

Quenneville had previously claimed he had no knowledge that Aldrich sexually assaulted anyone before Beach and the high school player sued the Blackhawks, but multiple witnesses stated that he was called into a meeting to discuss the Aldrich matter shortly after the Blackhawks defeated the Sharks to advance to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. Multiple people in the meeting claimed that the matter discussed did not directly involve sexual assault and then-CEO John McDonough in the meeting committed to getting more information and handling the matter while directing Quenneville and the rest of senior management to keep their focus on the upcoming Stanley Cup Finals.

On October 27, 2021, Quenneville was summoned to a meeting the following day with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman to discuss his role in the incident. Within hours of that meeting, Quenneville announced his immediate resignation as Panthers coach. He released a statement following his resignation &quot;I want to express my sorrow for the pain this young man, Kyle Beach, has suffered. My former team - the Blackhawks -- failed Kyle and I own my share of that. I want to reflect on how all this happened and take the time to educate myself on ensuring hockey spaces are safe for everyone.&quot; According to a formal NHL statement, Bettman, the Panthers, and Quenneville mutually agreed that &quot;it was no longer appropriate&quot; for Quenneville to stay on. Bettman also announced that Quenneville will have to meet with him before he is allowed to work in the NHL again.

On July 1, 2024, nearly three years after his abrupt resignation from the Panthers due to the Blackhawks scandal, Quenneville was reinstated by the NHL (along with Stan Bowman and Al MacIsaac) to seek future employment within the league.

==Personal life==
Quenneville is of Franco-Ontarian heritage and is married to Elizabeth, a native of Connecticut whom he met during his stint with the Hartford Whalers. They reside in Hinsdale, Illinois with their three children: a son, Dylan, and two daughters, Lily and Anna. After working in the U.S. for over 30 years, Quenneville passed the USCIS naturalization test required to become a United States citizen on May 24, 2011, and now has dual citizenship.

Quenneville was hospitalized and reported as being &quot;in stable condition after &#x27;severe discomfort&#x27; of a non-cardiac nature&quot; on February 16, 2011, resulting in him missing a home game versus the Minnesota Wild that night. After a conversation with the coach, Kelly Chase reported that Quenneville had suffered from internal bleeding, the cause of which was yet to be discovered, but that he was in high spirits and intended to be behind the bench for the Blackhawks next game on February 18. It was announced on February 18, that the problem had been a small ulcer caused by aspirin, a drug known to have the potential for gastrointestinal side effects. He finally returned to take the Blackhawks practice on February 23, having been released from the hospital on February 19.

Quenneville is a first cousin, once-removed, of Peter Quenneville, who was drafted 195th overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, John Quenneville, who was drafted 30th overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft and , who was drafted 200th overall by the New York Islanders in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft.

<text>The Geological Society of America (GSA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of the geosciences.


== History ==
The society was founded in Ithaca, New York, in 1888 by Alexander Winchell, John J. Stevenson, Charles H. Hitchcock, John R. Procter and Edward Orton and has been headquartered at 3300 Penrose Place, Boulder, Colorado, US, since 1967.

GSA began with 100 members under its first president, James Hall. In 1889 Mary Emilie Holmes became its first female member. It grew slowly but steadily to 600 members until 1931, when a nearly $4 million endowment from 1930 president R. A. F. Penrose Jr. jumpstarted GSA&#x27;s growth. As of December 2017, GSA had more than 25,000 members in over 100 countries.

The society has six regional sections in North America, three interdisciplinary interest groups, and eighteen specialty divisions.

==Activities==
The stated mission of GSA is &quot;to advance geoscience research and discovery, service to society, stewardship of Earth, and the geosciences profession&quot;. Its main activities are sponsoring scientific meetings and publishing scientific literature, particularly the peer-reviewed journals &quot;Geological Society of America Bulletin&quot;, published continuously since 1889, and &quot;Geology&quot;, published since 1973. In 2005, GSA introduced its online-only journal &quot;Geosphere&quot;, and in February 2009, GSA began publishing &quot;Lithosphere&quot; (both also peer-reviewed). &quot;Geosphere&quot; and &quot;Lithosphere&quot; are open access as of 2018. GSA&#x27;s monthly news and science magazine, &quot;GSA Today&quot;, is also open access online. GSA also publishes three book series: &quot;Special Papers&quot;, &quot;Memoirs&quot;, and &quot;Field Guides&quot;. A third major activity is awarding research grants to graduate students.

==Position statements==
GSA issues Position Statements &quot;in support of and consistent with the GSA&#x27;s Vision and Mission to develop consensus on significant professional, technical, and societal issues of relevance to the geosciences community. Position Statements, developed and adopted through a well-defined process, provide the basis for statements made on behalf of the GSA before government bodies and agencies and communicated to the media and the general public.&quot;

For example, in 2006, the GSA adopted a Position Statement on &quot;Global Climate Change&quot;:
:The Geological Society of America (GSA) supports the scientific conclusions that Earth&#x27;s climate is changing; the climate changes are due in part to human activities; and the probable consequences of the climate changes will be significant and blind to geopolitical boundaries. Furthermore, the potential implications of global climate change and the time scale over which such changes will likely occur require active, effective, long-term planning.
:Current predictions of the consequences of global climate change include: (1) rising sea level, (2) significant alteration of global and regional climatic patterns with an impact on water availability, (3) fundamental changes in global temperature distribution, (4) melting of polar ice, and (5) major changes in the distribution of plant and animal species. While the precise magnitude and rate of climate change cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, significant change will affect the planet and stress its inhabitants.

<text>The Gemstone File is a conspiracy theory document attributed to Bruce Porter Roberts. In 1975, &quot;A Skeleton Key to the Gemstone File&quot; appeared and is generally attributed to Stephanie Caruana. The &quot;Key&quot; is purportedly a synopsis of Roberts&#x27; documents that presents a chronicle of interlocking conspiracies, including claims that world events since the 1950s were shaped by suppressed information, the names of supposed shooters of President John F. Kennedy, and suggested connections between a number of political assassinations which occurred within a relatively short time frame. Authors James McConnachie and Robin Tudge called it &quot;the original mega-conspiracy theory.&quot;

==History==
Originally distributed in 1975 by hand and mail in photocopy form, the Gemstone File has appeared in slightly revised form in Hustler magazine and on the Internet. Roberts, known only to Stephanie Caruana and conspiracy theorist Mae Brussell, purportedly began gathering information in the file when Howard Hughes stole his invention for processing synthetic rubies, hence the title &quot;Gemstone&quot;. According to Gerald Carroll, Roberts was born in New York State on October 27, 1919, and died of lung cancer in San Francisco on July 16, 1976.

&quot;Factsheet Five&quot; publisher Mike Gunderloy collected and distributed several versions of the Gemstone File. Gunderloy wrote that the original Gemstone File was simply a list of contributors to Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP), while the subsequent versions gradually linked various figures of the Watergate and Kennedy eras.

== Outline ==
The Gemstone File proposes that Aristotle Onassis, Joseph P. Kennedy, and other prominent figures were involved in various schemes to forward a vast global conspiracy, involving the Mafia and corrupt politicians, brutal oil and drug cartels, rogue military operations, and more. It also posits that early in 1957, Aristotle Onassis had Howard Hughes kidnapped from his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow; that Hughes suffered a massive brain injury during the forcible kidnapping, and that Hughes was subsequently a virtual prisoner of Onassis on Skorpios and injected regularly with morphine, while Onassis took over the operation of Hughes&#x27;s considerable financial affairs, including airlines and U.S. defense contracting.

The Gemstone File portrays Onassis as the main force behind the election of John F. Kennedy as president and, subsequently, Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963. According to the documents, Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy in the JFK assassination plan and was linked to the Central Intelligence Agency, and to Mafia connections in New Orleans, with Jimmy Fratianno, Johnny Roselli, and Eugene Brading as the real shooters.} The Gemstone papers claim that John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy were involved with the Mafia and Onassis, and when the Kennedy brothers attempted to break away, they were murdered.

<doc id="794311" wikidata="Q5035730" url="?curid=794311" title="Capital punishment in Canada">
<text>Capital punishment in Canada dates to Canada&#x27;s earliest history, including its period as first a French then a British colony. From 1867 to the elimination of the death penalty for murder on July 26, 1976, 1,481 people had been sentenced to death, and 710 had been executed. Of those executed, 697 were men and 13 women. The only method used in Canada for capital punishment of civilians after the end of the French regime was hanging. The last execution in Canada was the double hanging of Arthur Lucas and Ronald Turpin on December 11, 1962, at Toronto&#x27;s Don Jail. The &quot;National Defence Act&quot; prescribed the death penalty for certain military offences until 1999, although no military executions had been carried out since 1946.

The death penalty was ended in practice in Canada in January 1963 and was abolished in two stages, in 1976 and 1999. Prior to 1976, the death penalty was prescribed under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; as the punishment for murder, treason, and piracy. In addition, some service offences under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; continued to carry a mandatory death sentence if committed traitorously, although no one had been executed for those offences since 1945. In 1976, Parliament enacted Bill C-48, abolishing the death penalty for murder, treason, and piracy. In 1999, Parliament eliminated the death penalty for the military offences.

==History==

===New France===

The post of executioner in New France was briefly held by André Bernard in 1645, but was not permanently occupied until 1648, when a military drummer stationed at the French garrison in Ville-Marie, New France was sentenced to death for sodomy by the local Sulpician priests. After an intervention by the Jesuits in Quebec City, the drummer&#x27;s life was spared on the condition that he accept the position of New France&#x27;s first permanent executioner. As only the drummer was placed on trial, some historians have suggested that his sexual partner may have been a First Nations man who was not subject to French religious law. The drummer&#x27;s real name has never been confirmed in historical records, however; in his 2006 book &quot;Répression des homosexuels au Québec et en France&quot;, historian Patrice Corriveau identified the drummer as &quot;René Huguet dit Tambour&quot;, although other historians have challenged this identification as no known historical records place a person of that name in New France any earlier than 1680.

With the role of executioner being unpopular, it was common in New France that a male criminal who had been sentenced to death could have his life spared if he agreed to take the job of executing others, while a female prisoner could have her life spared if the executioner agreed to marry her. Similar cases included Jacques Daigre, who was sentenced to death for theft in 1665 but managed to avoid being executed by agreeing to testify against and execute his associate, and Jean Corolère, who took the job in 1751 and simultaneously saved the life of fellow prisoner Françoise Laurent by marrying her.

===British North America===
In 1749, Peter Cartcel, a sailor aboard a ship in the Halifax harbour, stabbed Abraham Goodsides to death and wounded two other men. He was brought before a Captain&#x27;s Court where he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two days later he was hanged from the yardarm of the vessel as a deterrent to others. This is one of the earliest records of capital punishment in English-speaking Canada. It is difficult to accurately state numbers of capital punishment since there were no systematic efforts to accurately record names, dates, and locations of executions until after 1867, and many records have been lost because of fires, floods, or decay.

In 1840, an innocent man was hanged in what is now Windsor, Ontario, and this was learned after the true perpetrator of the crime had made a deathbed confession. This contributed to the abolition of capital punishment in Michigan across the river from Windsor.

===Post-Confederation===

After Confederation, a revision of the statutes reduced the number of offences punishable by death to three: murder, rape, and treason. In 1868, Parliament also stated that the location of the execution was to be within the confines of the prison instead of public hangings. By the 1870s, the jails had begun to build the gallows from the ground with a pit underneath instead of the previous high scaffold, the platform of which was level with the prison wall.

Robert Bickerdike was a businessman, politician, and social reformer, who believed the abolition of capital punishment was an imperative and to some extent his life’s mission. Few spoke as loudly or as eloquently as he did for this reform. As a Member of Parliament, in 1914 and again in 1916 he introduced a bill to replace the death penalty with a life sentence. He opposed capital punishment on many grounds, considering it an insult to Christianity and religion in general and a blot on any civilized nation. &quot;There is nothing&quot;, he stated in the house, &quot;more degrading to society at large ... than the death penalty.&quot; He also spoke of class disparities, pointing out that the punishment was administered to the poor far more often than to the wealthy. He refuted the notion that state-sponsored killing acted as a deterrent to murder and cautioned against the possibility of mistake.

In 1950, an attempt was made to abolish capital punishment. Ross Thatcher, at that time a Cooperative Commonwealth Federation Member of Parliament, moved Bill No. 2 in order to amend the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; to abolish the death penalty. Thatcher later withdrew it for fear of Bill No. 2 not generating positive discussion and further harming the chances of abolition. In 1956, the Joint Committee of the House and Senate recommended the retention of capital punishment as the mandatory punishment for murder, which opened the door to the possibility of abolition.

In 1961, legislation was introduced to reclassify murder into capital and non-capital murder, later renamed to first degree and second degree murder. A capital murder involved a planned or deliberate murder, murder during violent crimes, or the murder of a police officer or prison guard. Non-capital murder did not carry the death sentence. The only death sentences carried out after the reform, of Turpin and Lucas, were under the police murder rule.

===Abolition===
Following the success of Lester Pearson and the Liberal Party in the 1963 federal election, and through the successive governments of Pierre Trudeau, the federal cabinet commuted all death sentences as a matter of policy. Hence, in practice the death penalty ceased to be used in Canada in 1963. On November 30, 1967, Bill C-168 was passed creating a five-year moratorium on the use of the death penalty, except for murders of police and corrections officers. On January 26, 1973, after the expiration of the five-year experiment, the Solicitor General of Canada continued the partial ban on capital punishment, which would eventually lead to the abolition of capital punishment. On July 14, 1976, Bill C-84 was passed by a narrow margin of 130:124 in a free vote, resulting in the abolition of the death penalty for murder, treason, and piracy. It was given royal assent on July 16 and came into force July 26, 1976.

Capital murder was replaced with first degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence without eligibility for parole until the person has served 25 years of the sentence.

On June 30, 1987, a bill to restore the death penalty was defeated by the House of Commons in a 148–127 vote, in which Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Minister of Justice Ray Hnatyshyn, and Minister of External Affairs Joe Clark opposed the bill, while Deputy Prime Minister Donald Mazankowski and a majority of Progressive Conservative MPs supported it.

Certain military offences under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; (committed by members of the Canadian Armed Forces) continued to carry the death penalty (cowardice, desertion, unlawful surrender, and spying for the enemy), with mandatory death penalty if committed traitorously. Bill C-25 replaced those death penalties with life imprisonment, resulting in the complete legal abolition of the death penalty in Canada, effective September 1, 1999.

=== Last executions in Canada ===

The last two people executed in Canada were Ronald Turpin, 29, and Arthur Lucas, 54, convicted of separate murders, at 12:02 am on December 11, 1962, at the Don Jail in Toronto. 

The last woman to be hanged in Canada was Marguerite Pitre on January 9, 1953, at Bordeaux Prison in Montreal, for her part in the bombing of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 108.

The last person sentenced to death was Mario Gauthier on May 14, 1976, for the murder of a prison guard in Quebec. He was reprieved when capital punishment was abolished for all &quot;Criminal Code&quot; offences on July 14 the same year.
===Military executions===
During the First World War, 25 Canadian soldiers were executed. Most were shot for service offences such as desertion and cowardice, but two executions were for murder. For details of these see &quot;List of Canadian soldiers executed during World War I&quot;.

One Canadian soldier, Pte. Harold Pringle, was executed during the Second World War for murder. Furthermore, five German prisoners-of-war (POWs) convicted of the murders of other POWs were among the six executed in Canada&#x27;s last mass execution in 1946.

=== Executioners ===
====John Radclive====
John Radclive was Canada&#x27;s first professional executioner, placed on the federal payroll as a hangman by a Dominion order-in-council in 1892, on the recommendation of the justice minister Sir John Thompson. Radclive is often described as having trained under British hangman William Marwood although there is no documentary proof for this. He can be shown to have hanged at least 69 people in Canada, although his life total was likely much higher. At his death, the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; said he had 150 executions. He died of alcohol-related illness in Toronto on February 26, 1911, at the age of 55.

====Arthur Ellis====
Arthur Ellis was the pseudonym of Arthur B. English, a British man who became Canada&#x27;s official hangman in 1913, after Radclive&#x27;s death. Ellis worked as a hangman in Canada until the botched execution of Thomasina Sarao in Montreal in 1935, in which she was decapitated. He died in poverty in Montreal in July 1938.

The Arthur Ellis Awards—named after this pseudonym—is an annual literary award presented by the Crime Writers of Canada. Ellis is featured in the 2009 documentary &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Graveyard&quot;.

====Camille Branchaud====
The executioner who worked as Camille Branchaud, a pseudonym, succeeded Ellis. Branchaud was on the Quebec government payroll as a hangman, and executed people elsewhere in the country on a piecework basis. The hangman was traditionally based in Montreal where between 1912 and 1960 the gallows at Bordeaux Prison saw more executions (85) take place than any other correctional facility in Canada.

Branchaud carried out many executions (for which he was not paid) in the postwar period in Canada, such as the double hanging of Leonard Jackson and Steven Suchan of the Boyd Gang at the Don Jail in 1952, and Robert Raymond Cook&#x27;s execution in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, in 1960.

== Methods ==
The first official method of hanging for executions in Canada was &quot;hoisting&quot; in which a rope would be thrown over a beam and the convicted person would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope. The slip knot would then tightly close around the neck until strangulation. A variation of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart and then it would be pushed from under him. This led to the development of suspension in which &quot;the drop&quot; caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution. Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly , which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to .

The majority of offenders put to death by Canadian civilian authorities were executed by long drop hanging developed in the United Kingdom by William Marwood. This method ensured that the prisoner&#x27;s neck was broken instantly at the end of the drop, resulting in the prisoner dying of asphyxia while unconscious, which was considered more humane than the slow death by strangulation which often resulted from the previous &quot;short drop&quot; method. The short drop sometimes gave a period of suffering before death finally took place.

Early in his career, John Radclive persuaded several sheriffs in Ontario and Quebec to let him use an alternative method in which the condemned person was jerked into the air. A gallows of this type was used for the execution of Robert Neil at Toronto&#x27;s Don Jail on February 29, 1888:

The old plan of a &quot;drop&quot; was discarded for a more merciful machine, by which the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of , which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution … At the words &quot;Forgive us our trespasses,&quot; the executioner drove his chisel against the light rope that held the ponderous iron at the other end of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell with a thud, and the body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.

The hanging of Reginald Birchall in Woodstock, Ontario, in November 1890, seems to be the last time a device of this kind was used. Radclive had first been exposed to executions as a Royal Navy seaman helping with shipboard hangings of pirates in the South China Sea, and it is possible he was trying to approximate something similar to hanging a man on a ship&#x27;s yardarm. After Birchall&#x27;s hanging, Radclive used the traditional long drop method, as did his successors.

While hanging was a relatively humane method of execution under ideal conditions with an expert executioner, mistakes could and did happen. Condemned prisoners were decapitated by accident at Headingley Jail in Manitoba and Bordeaux Jail in Montreal, and a prisoner at the Don Jail in Toronto hit the floor of the room below and was strangled by the hangman.

Some Canadian jails—such as those in Toronto, Whitby and Ottawa, Ontario; Headingley, Manitoba; and Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta—had permanent indoor execution facilities, but more typically offenders were hanged on a scaffold built for the occasion in the jail yard.

Military prisoners sentenced to death under Canadian military law were shot by a firing squad.

==Public opinion==
Although reintroducing the death penalty in Canada is extremely unlikely, support for capital punishment is similar to its support in the United States, where it is carried out regularly in some states and is on the books in most states and on the federal level. While opposition to the death penalty increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, in recent years, Canadians have moved closer to the American position; in 2004, only 48 percent of Canadians favoured death for murderers compared to 62 percent in 2010. According to one poll, support for the death penalty in Canada is approximately the same as its support in the United States, at 63 percent in both countries . A 2012 poll by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; found that 66 percent of Canadians favoured capital punishment, but only 41 percent would actually support its re-introduction in Canada. A 2020 poll by Research Co. found that 51 percent of Canadians are in favour of reinstating the death penalty for murder in their country. However, almost half of Canadians (47%) select life imprisonment without the possibility of parole over the death penalty (34%) as their preferred punishment in cases of murder. A 2023 poll by Research Co. found that 54 percent of Canadians are in favour of reinstating the death penalty for murder in their country. A 2024 poll found 57 percent of Canadians support reinstating the death penalty.

Since abolition, only two parties were known to have advocated to bringing it back: the Reform Party of Canada (1988–2000) and the National Advancement Party of Canada (since 2014).

Among the reasons cited for banning capital punishment in Canada were fears about wrongful convictions, concerns about the state taking people&#x27;s lives, and uncertainty about the death penalty&#x27;s role as a deterrent for crime. The 1959 conviction of 14-year-old Steven Truscott, who was sentenced to death and whose conviction was later overturned, was a significant impetus toward the abolition of capital punishment. Truscott was sentenced to death for the murder of a classmate. His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence, and in 2007, he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state that he was in fact innocent).

== Policy regarding foreign capital punishment ==

In the 1990s, Canada extradited a criminal, Charles Ng to the United States, even though he appealed to the authorities, as he did not want to potentially face execution.

The Supreme Court of Canada, in the case &quot;United States v. Burns&quot;, (2001), determined that Canada should not extradite persons to face trial in other countries for crimes punishable by death unless Canada has received an assurance that the foreign state will not apply the death penalty, essentially overruling &quot;Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)&quot;, (1991). This is similar to the extradition policies of other nations such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Israel, Mexico, Colombia and Australia, which also refuse to extradite prisoners who may be condemned to death. Extradition where the death penalty is possible was ruled a violation of the European Convention of Human Rights in the case of &quot;Soering v United Kingdom&quot; outlawing the practice in member states of the Council of Europe, of which all of the European Union member states are part.

In November 2007, Canada&#x27;s minority Conservative government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith&#x27;s case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government &quot;should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world&quot;. However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy.

In a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, &quot;I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.&quot;

<text>Bristol Motor Speedway (formerly known as the Bristol International Raceway from 1978 to 1996 and as the Bristol International Speedway from 1961 to 1978) is a oval short track in Bristol, Tennessee. The track has held a variety of events since its opening in 1961, including NASCAR races, NCAA FBS college football games, and sprint car races. The speedway has a capacity of 146,000 as of 2021. In addition to the main oval, the facility&#x27;s complex also features a two-lane, long drag strip. Bristol Motor Speedway is currently owned by Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI) with Jerry Caldwell serving as the track&#x27;s general manager.

On January 17, 1961, local Tennessean recreational conglomerate businessman Larry Carrier announced his intentions of building a racetrack in Bristol, expanding his recreational conglomerate within the Tri-Cities, Tennessee, area. The track was constructed with no major issues, and opened in July of that same year for a speed record run. Carrier ran the track until 1977, when it was sold to businessmen Gary Baker and Lanny Hester. The duo&#x27;s ownership was quickly bought out by Warner W. Hodgdon, who ran the facility until 1986 when Hodgdon suffered financial troubles. Carrier later regained control of the facility, owning it until 1996 when Bruton Smith bought control of it. Since Smith&#x27;s purchase, BMS underwent major expansion, becoming one of the largest sporting facilities in the United States.

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===
Bristol Motor Speedway (BMS) in its current form is measured at , with the track&#x27;s turns ranging from 24 degrees to 30 degrees in banking. The straightaways are banked at four degrees at the bottom and progresses up to 9 degrees at the top. When the track was initially constructed, the track had 27 degrees of banking. Before 2007, the track marketed that the track&#x27;s banking was 36 degrees; this was eventually later found to be incorrect, with the true banking being 30 degrees. When the track is temporarily covered with dirt, the track uses a progressing banking system from 16 to 19 degrees. The track is also the only track left on the NASCAR schedule that utilizes two pit road lanes instead of one, combined pit road lane.

=== Amenities ===
At the time of the track&#x27;s initial construction, the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; reported the track had a capacity of 21,000, a press box, around 10,000 parking spaces, and shower rooms upon a 120-acre facility. The track has since seen mass expansion during the ownerships of Larry Carrier and Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI). As of 2024, the facility features a capacity of 146,000, down from its peak of 162,000. The facility also features a 30-by-63 foot television screen that hangs over the middle of the track that is named Colossus TV.

==== Adjacent drag strip ====
In 1964, plans for a drag strip were announced by then-track owner Larry Carrier and National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) officials. After a hasty construction process, the dragstrip was completed by May 1965. The dragstrip has gone under renovations since the 1990s, including an $18 million renovation in 1997.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===
In 1960, businessman Larry Carrier, continuing plans to expand a local recreation conglomerate within the Tri-Cities, Tennessee, area, wanted to build a race track. He drew up initial plans to build a track in Piney Flats, Tennessee, using land his real-estate agent father had bought. However, the plan was rejected by local ministers in the area. Carrier instead opted to build the track five miles south on land formerly used as a dairy farm. Carrier, with later assistance from R. G. Pope and Carl R. Moore, drew up ideas for the track on paper bags. On January 17, 1961, the three announced plans to build a 20,000-seat, 100-acre, track adjacent to U.S. Route 11E at a budget from $750,000 to $1,000,000. Along with the announcement, two annual NASCAR-sanctioned races were announced, with further intentions to use the track for other entertainment purposes.

Although groundbreaking on the facility was scheduled on January 23, it was delayed by poor weather for two days to the 25th. The next month, new local modified races were announced at the track. By March, the track was selling tickets, with Tennessee Ernie Ford buying the first ticket. Within same month, Carrier was able to negotiate with Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall to hold a National Football League (NFL) exhibition game between the Redskins and the Philadelphia Eagles after a failed attempt by Marshall to hold the game at the Charlotte Motor Speedway.

The track was met with optimism throughout Tennessee and with sports personalities. The track was praised for its layout and amenities by team owner Bud Moore, driver Cotton Owens, and Redskins public relations director Dave Slattery. The Governor of Tennessee at the time, Buford Ellington, declared a &quot;Volunteer 500&quot; week in the state of Tennessee. Jimmy Smyth, a writer for the &quot;Johnson City Press&quot;, praised that local residents in the Tri-Cities area now had a track nearby instead of driving hundreds of miles to another track.

=== Early years ===
The track officially opened to the public on July 23, 1961, for a paved half-mile speed record attempt by driver Tommy Morgan. Two days later, the track opened for NASCAR-sanctioned activities, with a practice session for the 1961 Volunteer 500. The next year, Carrier announced in the &quot;Bristol Virginia–Tennessean&quot; of a new recreational building near the track along with highway renovations. The track was favored in the local media by this point; the &quot;Virginia–Tennessean&quot; declared the track to be the &quot;best&quot; and &quot;fastest&quot; half-mile track in the world. The track did face difficulties; according to Carrier, the 1961 NFL game lost them $36,000. As a result of the loss, Pope left the track soon after, leaving the track to be run by Carrier and Moore.

In October 1964, the &quot;Bristol Herald Courier&quot; reported that the track was negotiating with National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) officials on building a proposed dragstrip. Two months later, the dragstrip project was officially announced by Carrier, with the facility announced to be a 27,000-seat, long facility built on a 500-acre plot of land at a budget of $700,000. A month after the announcement, Russ DeVault, writer for the &quot;Herald Courier&quot;, predicted that Carrier was planning to build a bigger facility that was at least long; Carrier neither denied or admitted the predicted project. In March 1965, the track announced plans to build a long road course that would utilize parts of the dragstrip. By May, the dragstrip was finished in time for its opening in early June. By the beginning of 1966, the track was beginning to construct the road course.

In 1969, Carrier announced a repave and reconfiguration of the track. The banking in the turns was changed to a progressive banking system from 31 to 35 degrees and the straightaways would be changed to 20 degrees, which Carrier promised would produce speeds nearing . The repave was completed by July of that year, and in the next major race, drivers saw average lap speeds of over 100 mph. The next year, when Carrier created the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA), he set up the association&#x27;s headquarters at the track.

=== Lanny Hester and Gary Baker era ===
By the mid-1970s, Carrier wanted to focus more on his drag racing endeavors with the IHRA. On November 2, 1977, Carrier announced the sale of the track to Nashville businessmen Lanny Hester and Gary Baker for $1 million. At the time of the duo&#x27;s purchase, the track had seen stagnating attendance, which the duo attributed to shortening its NASCAR races to 400 laps. Upon the track&#x27;s purchase, the duo announced $200,000 worth of renovations, a rebranding to &quot;Bristol International Raceway&quot;, an increase of purse money, and a revert to the traditional 500 lap distance for its NASCAR races. In addition, the track planned to run its first ever night race at the 1978 Volunteer 500, with temporary lights being installed during for the night race. The renovations did see success, with increased attendance according to Kingsport Times writer Denny Darnell.

=== Short-lived Warner W. Hodgdon era ===
In January 1981, Baker bought out Hester&#x27;s share of the track. However, just 10 months later, then-public relations manager of the track, Eddie Gossage announced that California businessman Warner W. Hodgdon bought out half of Baker&#x27;s share of the track&#x27;s ownership. According to Baker, while he did not initially intend on selling some of his interest, his opinion changed when Hodgdon displayed interest of buying out some of Baker&#x27;s interest. With Hodgdon&#x27;s investment, Hodgdon stated plans to increase the capacity of the track to 50,000. In May 1982, Baker and Hodgdon also purchased the dragstrip from Carrier. By October, according to Gossage in a letter to the editor of the &quot;Herald Courier&quot;, he claimed that Hodgdon increased capacity by 3,000, added new sewer and water lines, and expanded parking.

In July 1983, Hodgdon purchased the rest of Baker&#x27;s interest in the track for $2 million, completely buying out the track. As a result of Hodgdon&#x27;s purchase, Carrier was appointed to become the general manager. The next month, Carrier announced a new renovation plan over several years. However, by the late fall, staff were disgruntled; according to staff who worked with Hodgdon, he was heavily disliked. Then-public relations manager of the Hodgdon-owned Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway, Tom Roberts, had a grudge with Hodgdon, and immediately realized &quot;I needed to be looking for another job... I looked at him as one of the biggest charlatans I had ever encountered&quot;, sharing sentiments with Gossage, who both left soon after Hodgdon bought the track.

By the end of 1984, Hodgdon faced a litany of legal issues. In November, &quot;The Tennessean&quot;&#x27;s Larry Woody reported that Hodgdon was facing accusations of bid rigging in his home state of California along with his company, the National Engineering Company, facing bankruptcy. By the end of December, he was facing additional lawsuits from the North Carolina Motor Speedway and overdue payments to the Tennessee State Fair and Exposition Commission. He later failed to meet deadlines for a $102,000 payment for the Bristol track. By January 1985, the Bank of Virginia planned to put the track and the dragstrip up for auction on February 8. However, the auction was eventually scrapped when Hodgdon filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, requesting for protection and reorganization. Despite this, Carrier declared that the track&#x27;s events for the year would still occur. NASCAR eventually confirmed Carrier&#x27;s declaration in February, with Carrier being proclaimed by the &quot;Johnson City Press&quot; as the one who was able to maintain events at the track. The track also struck a five-year deal to broadcast its NASCAR races nationally on ESPN.

=== Larry Carrier&#x27;s return ===
In November 1985, rumors of Kentucky businessman and drag racer Jim Ruth buying out a portion of the complex were denied by Carrier, with Carrier claiming that he was planning to buy out National Raceways, Hodgdon&#x27;s company that owned the Bristol track. At the end of January 1986, Carrier&#x27;s purchase was officially confirmed, paying $4.5–5 million for the company. Carrier also announced the sale of the dragstrip to Ruth to finance Carrier&#x27;s purchase. With his purchase, Carrier announced further renovations, including a new 5,000-seat grandstand and new concrete walls.

The track throughout the 1980s saw increases in popularity and continued sellouts for the track, with the success of the track being remarked as &quot;unprecedented in NASCAR racing&quot; by &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; writer Tom Higgins. By the end of the decade, sellouts were guaranteed for the track months before the track&#x27;s races occurred, along with the striking of a five-year renewal with ESPN. The track by this point had expanded to 50,000 seats and generated more than $138 million annually in economic revenue, with stated future intentions to build $400,000 worth of improvements. In 1989, the track also sought to expand to hold major concerts according to then-general manager Ron Scalf.

During the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the track oversaw numerous repaves. In September 1988, a $500,000 repave of the track was announced that was completed the next month. To Carrier&#x27;s ire, the new surface saw increased tire wear, which Carrier blamed on how the track was resurfaced. In lieu of Carrier&#x27;s anger of the new surface, he announced another repave in May 1989. The surface received complaints by drivers for the surface being too rough and bumpy. By the fall of 1991, Carrier announced a third repave. The surface still oversaw more complaints for being too bumpy, and after the 1992 Food City 500, Carrier announced another complete repave of the track. This time, Carrier opted to pave the surface in concrete instead of asphalt, which was what the track had been using since its inception. The repave was completed in July of that year.

=== Bruton Smith&#x27;s purchase, expansion ===
Despite Carrier stating at the start of the 1990s that he had no intention of selling the track, sometime in the early 1990s, motorsports mogul Bruton Smith displayed interest of buying Bristol International Raceway. According to Scalf, although Carrier refused, Smith insisted on purchasing the track, stating, &quot;everything is for sale&quot;. Within the next three weeks, Carrier, Scalf, and Smith negotiated the potential sale of the track, with the situation being described by Scalf as &quot;where one family-owned track was basically competing with corporate America&quot;. Although Carrier stated fears to Scalf about losing NASCAR race weekends, he eventually agreed to sell off the complex with the exception of a 78-acre campground. On January 23, 1996, the sale of the track was confirmed at the cost of $26 million, with an executive for the sports marketing division of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Jeff Byrd, replacing Scalf as general manager.

Upon the track&#x27;s purchase, Smith&#x27;s ownership was met with suspicion. Many local businesses and fans feared that the track could lose a NASCAR race weekend as a result of NASCAR experiencing a surge in popularity in the 1990s, with Smith having a previous record of buying or building bigger tracks and taking away race weekends from smaller tracks. The loss of a race weekend spurred fears of crippling the local Tri-Cities economy. In February 1996, Smith denied rumors of moving the track&#x27;s spring race weekend to the new Texas Motor Speedway, along with announcing intentions of increasing capacity to 120,000, an increase from 81,000 from when Smith bought it. Initial renovations started in March, with further plans for expansion and events being announced by Byrd. The track was also renamed &quot;Bristol Motor Speedway&quot; within the month. By the end of the year, Byrd estimated the track had spent $20 million in renovations, with more renovations being announced in November. By April 1997, the track surpassed Neyland Stadium as the largest sports arena in Tennessee by capacity. The track continued to oversee further expansion in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 1999, the track constructed the Kulwicki Tower, which was completed by 2000 and increased capacity by 12,000 seats to 147,000. In 2000 and 2001, the track held its first dirt races on a temporary dirt surface; however, the races were scrapped after 2001 due to issues with lengthy cleanups.

==== Track changes, short-lived dirt racing ====
In 2002, the track expanded further; the track built a new pedestrian tunnel that connected the grandstands to the infield, along with stated plans to expand seating. In August, the seating expansion was officially confirmed, with an intent to expand to 160,000. In 2006, the track officially announced a repave of its track surface; however, the repave was later rescheduled to occur in 2007. By the time the new variable-banking system was complete in August, the turns varied from 24 to 30 degrees, with the racing surface being widened from 40 to 43 feet.

The track repave saw criticism for removing the one-lane and rough style racing Bristol became reputable for; criticism became so prevalent that an ashamed Byrd was stated to have repeated &quot;y&#x27;all, we&#x27;re sorry&quot; to fans leaving the track after the 2008 Sharpie 500. In 2010, the track saw its streak of 55 consecutive sellouts for its NASCAR races end. In October of that year, after Byrd died in October, the track promoted its vice president of corporate sales, Jerry Caldwell, to become the track&#x27;s general manager. Two years later, in response to both fan criticism along with Smith&#x27;s stated displeasure with the progressive banking system, the track announced the elimination of the progressive banking system. In October 2015, the track announced the construction of Colossus TV, a 30-by-63 foot television screen that was touted as the world&#x27;s largest &quot;outdoor, permanent, center-hung digital display&quot;. Construction on the screen started in November and was completed in April 2016. In that same year, the track began applying PJ1 TrackBite, a traction compound, on the track&#x27;s lower groove in an attempt to artificially create multi-groove racing.

==== NASCAR ====
Bristol Motor Speedway hosts two annual NASCAR weekends: The NASCAR Cup Series with the Food City 500 and the Bass Pro Shops Night Race. The Food City 500 was first held on October 22, 1961. In 2020, to address declining attendance, track officials announced the race would be run on a temporary dirt surface, with the truck Series also competing on dirt. After three years, the event returned to its original concrete surface. The Bass Pro Shops Night Race, first held on July 30, 1961, was the track&#x27;s first major event. In 1978, the race transitioned to a nighttime format.

In addition to its Cup Series events, the track also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series races as support races for the Cup Series. In 2020, BMS held a one-off edition of the NASCAR All-Star Race, which moved to Texas Motor Speedway the following season.

==== American football games ====
On various occasions, the track has held American gridiron football games at varying levels. In 1961, the track hosted an exhibition National Football League (NFL) game between the Washington Redskins and the Philadelphia Eagles after an initial failed attempt to host an event at Charlotte Motor Speedway. In 2013, an NCAA Division I FBS game was officially announced for the track between the Tennessee Volunteers and the Virginia Tech Hokies, to take place in 2016. The game took place on September 10, with the Volunteers winning. A week after the Battle at Bristol, the track played host to another football game, this time a for NCAA Division I FCS game between the East Tennessee State Buccaneers and the Western Carolina Catamounts.

==== Baseball games ====

Bristol Motor Speedway will host a Major League Baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds on August 2, 2025, which will be the first regular-season MLB game played in the state of Tennessee.

=== Other events and uses ===
The track on numerous occasions has served as a facility to assist the general public in a variety of situations. In 2002, the track acted as a temporary high school for students at Sullivan East High School when their school was closed due to a black mold infection. In the early 2010s, Remote Area Medical held a medical clinic at the track. The track has been used as an evacuee center for several hurricanes, including Hurricane Irma in 2017, Hurricane Florence in 2018, and Hurricane Dorian in 2019. The track has also been used as a COVID-19 vaccine distribution center.

In 1968, the track served as a campaign rally for longtime Alabama Governor George Wallace for his campaign in the 1968 United States presidential election. In 2021, YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, known by his alias MrBeast, held a game of tag between 10 people at the track with a purse of $500,000 given to the winner.

<text>A yoke is a wooden beam used between a pair of oxen or other animals to enable them to pull together on a load when working in pairs, as oxen usually do; some yokes are fitted to individual animals. There are several types of yoke, used in different cultures, and for different types of oxen. A pair of oxen may be called a &quot;yoke of oxen&quot;, and yoke is also a verb, as in &quot;to &quot;yoke&quot; a pair of oxen&quot;. Other animals that may be yoked include horses, mules, donkeys, and water buffalo.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;yoke&quot; is believed to derive from Proto-Indo-European *yugóm (yoke), from root *&quot;yewg&quot;- (join, unite), and is thus cognate with &quot;yoga&quot;. This root has descendants in almost all known Indo-European languages including German &quot;Joch&quot;, Latin &quot;iugum&quot;, Ancient Greek ζυγόν (&quot;zygon&quot;), Persian یوغ (&quot;yuğ&quot;), Sanskrit युग (&quot;yugá&quot;), Hittite 𒄿𒌑𒃷 (iúkan), Old Church Slavonic иго (&quot;igo&quot;), Lithuanian &quot;jungas&quot;, Old Irish &quot;cuing&quot;, and Armenian լուծ (&quot;luts&quot;), all meaning &quot;yoke&quot;.

==Neck or bow yoke==

A &quot;bow yoke&quot; is a shaped wooden crosspiece bound to the necks of a pair of oxen (or occasionally to horses). It is held on the animals&#x27; necks by an oxbow, from which it gets its name. The oxbow is usually U-shaped and also transmits force from the animals&#x27; shoulders. A swivel between the animals, beneath the centre of the yoke, attaches to the pole of a vehicle or to chains (traces) used to drag a load.

Bow yokes are traditional in Europe, and in the United States, Australia, and Africa.
==Head yoke==

A &quot;head yoke&quot; fits onto the head of the oxen. It usually fits behind the horns, and has carved-out sections into which the horns fit; it may be a single beam attached to both oxen, or each ox may have a separate short beam. The yoke is then strapped to the horns of the oxen with yoke straps. Some types fit instead onto the front of the head, again strapped to the horns, and ox pads are then used for cushioning the forehead of the ox (see picture). A tug pole is held to the bottom of the yoke using yoke irons and chains. The tug pole can either be a short pole with a chain attached for hauling, or a long pole with a hook on the end that has no chain at all. Sometimes the pole is attached to a wagon and the oxen are simply backed over this pole, the pole is then raised between them and a backing bolt is dropped into the chains on the yoke irons in order to haul the wagon.

Head yokes are used in southern Europe, much of South America and in Canada.

==Withers yoke==

A &quot;withers yoke&quot; is a yoke that fits just in front of the withers, or the shoulder blades, of the oxen. The yoke is held in position by straps, either alone or with a pair of wooden staves on either side of the ox&#x27;s withers; the pull is however from the yoke itself, not from the staves. Withers yokes particularly suit zebu cattle, which have high humps on their withers.

Withers yokes are widely used in Africa and India, where zebu cattle are common.
==Comparison==
Although all three yoke types are effective, each has its advantages and disadvantages. As noted above, withers yokes suit zebu cattle, and head yokes can of course only be used for animals with suitable horns. Head yokes need to be re-shaped frequently to fit the animals&#x27; horns as they grow; unlike other types, a single-beam head yoke fixes the heads of the oxen apart, helping them to stand quietly without fighting. A single-beam head yoke may offer better braking ability on downhill grades and appears to be preferred in rugged mountainous areas such as Switzerland, Spain and parts of Italy. Bow yokes need to be the correct size for the animal, and new ones are often made as an animal grows, but they need no adjustment in use. Whichever type is used, various lengths of yoke may be required for different agricultural implements or to adjust to different crop-row spacings.

==Single yoke==

A yoke may be used with a single animal. Oxen are normally worked in pairs, but water buffalo in Asian countries are commonly used singly, with the aid of a bow-shaped withers yoke. Use of single bow or withers yokes on oxen is documented from North America, China, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Switzerland, and several designs of single head or forehead yoke are recorded in Germany.

==Symbolism==

The yoke has connotations of subservience and toiling; in some ancient cultures it was traditional to force a vanquished enemy to pass beneath a symbolic yoke of spears or swords. The yoke may be a metaphor for something oppressive or burdensome, such as feudalism, imperialism, corvée, tribute, or conscription, as in the expressions the &quot;Norman Yoke&quot; (in England), the &quot;Tatar Yoke&quot; (in Russia), or the &quot;Turkish Yoke&quot; (in the Balkans).

The metaphor can also refer to the state of being linked or chained together by contract or marriage, similar to a pair of oxen. This sense is also the source of the word yoga, as linking with the divine.

The yoke is frequently used metaphorically in the Bible, first in Genesis regarding Esau. In the Ancient Greek play &quot;The Persians&quot; by Aeschylus (5th century BC) it also makes an appearance. The 1st century BC Roman poets Catullus and Horace also used the metaphor but in the context of romance.

In the 20th century, the yoke and arrows became a political symbol of the Falange political movement in Spain.

<text>The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization of Earth, atmospheric, ocean, hydrologic, space, and planetary scientists and enthusiasts that according to their website includes 130,000 people (not members). AGU&#x27;s activities are focused on the organization and dissemination of scientific information in the interdisciplinary and international fields within the Earth and space sciences. The geophysical sciences involve four fundamental areas: atmospheric and ocean sciences; solid-Earth sciences; hydrologic sciences; and space sciences. The organization&#x27;s headquarters is located on Florida Avenue in Washington, D.C.

== History ==
The AGU was established in December 1919 by the National Research Council (NRC) to represent the United States in the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), and its first chairman was William Bowie of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS). For more than 50 years, it operated as an unincorporated affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences. On June 29, 1972, AGU was incorporated in the District of Columbia and membership was opened to scientists and students worldwide.

The AGU was intended to promote &quot;pure&quot; geophysics; exploration geophysics has its own society, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. In a March 1919 report by a committee chaired by Robert S. Woodward of the Carnegie Institution, geophysics was defined as a collection of &quot;borderlands&quot; (closely related, mutually dependent subjects): astronomy, geodesy, geology, meteorology, oceanography, seismology, terrestrial magnetism, terrestrial electricity, tides, and volcanology. The AGU was organized under seven sections: Geodesy, Seismology, Meteorology, Terrestrial magnetism and electricity, Oceanography, Volcanology, and Geophysical chemistry. Hydrology was added in 1930 and Tectonophysics in 1940. In suggesting the latter name, Norman Bowen evoked a familiar theme: to &quot;designate this new borderline field between geophysics, physics and geology for the solution of problems of tectonics.&quot;

The first meeting of the AGU took place on April 23, 1920. In attendance were 25 members. Up to 1930, the number of members was restricted and members were elected. In 1932 the first annual dues of were imposed. The membership grew to 4,600 in 1950; 13,000 in 1980; and 26,000 in 1990. As of 2018, it had 62,000 members from 137 countries.

== Publications ==

AGU publishes the online magazine &quot;Eos&quot; and more than twenty peer-reviewed scientific journals:

*&quot;AGU Advances&quot;
*&quot;Earth and Space Science&quot;
*&quot;Earth&#x27;s Future&quot;
*&quot;Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems&quot;
*&quot;GeoHealth&quot;
*&quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot;
*&quot;Global Biogeochemical Cycles&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Geophysical Research&quot; – sections A (Space Physics), B (Solid Earth), C (Oceans), D (Atmospheres), E (Planets), F (Earth Surface), and G (Biogeosciences)
*&quot;Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology&quot;
*&quot;Radio Science&quot;
*&quot;Reviews of Geophysics&quot;
*&quot;Space Weather&quot;
*&quot;Tectonics&quot;
*&quot;Water Resources Research&quot;
The journal &quot;Radio Science&quot; is co-sponsored by the International Union of Radio Science.
The journal &quot;Earth Interactions&quot; is published in partnership with the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Association of American Geographers (AAG).
In addition, &quot;International Journal of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy&quot; is no longer published and AGU distributes &quot;Chinese Journal of Geophysics&quot; and &quot;Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics&quot;. Many of the journals have high impact factors, with &quot;Paleoceanography&quot; having the highest within paleontology and &quot;Reviews of Geophysics&quot; the second highest within geochemistry and geophysics as of 2010. AGU has also been publishing books for more than 85 years.

AGU has also partnered with societies to publish:

*&quot;Chinese Journal of Geophysics&quot;, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences
*&quot;Earth and Planetary Physics&quot;, with the Chinese Geophysical Society
*&quot;Earth Interactions&quot;, with the American Meteorological Society
*&quot;Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics&quot;, with the European Geosciences Union
*&quot;Interpretation&quot;, with the Society of Exploration Geophysicists
*&quot;The Leading Edge&quot;, with the Society of Exploration Geophysicists

AGU co-published (along with the AMS and the AAG) its first electronic journal, &quot;Earth Interactions&quot;, in 1997. It started its own electronic journal, &quot;Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems&quot;, in December 1999. It made a full transition to electronic publishing in 2001. For all its journals, the electronic version became the publication of record. This was accompanied by a new identification scheme for articles that entirely did away with sequential page numbers. Instead, each article had a digital object identifier (DOI). As an example, 10.1029/2001GL014304 consists of the publisher identifier (10.1029), the year (2001), the journal code (GL), and an article number (014304). This new system was met with complaints from libraries and scientists. The article numbers provided no clue for libraries to find an article in printed versions, and even scientific databases were not set up to handle DOIs. AGU officials claimed that the problems were a temporary cost of being a frontrunner, but did retroactively assign each article a four-digit article number.

In 2012 the journals and books, including over one and a half million pages of legacy content, were transferred to the Wiley Online Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons were recognized for this work with the IT Project Team of the Year Award at the UK IT Industry Awards for 2013.

Five AGU journals are open access only: &quot;AGU Advances&quot;, &quot;Earth’s Future&quot;, &quot;Earth and Space Science&quot;, &quot;GeoHealth&quot;, &quot;JAMES&quot;, and &quot;Space Weather&quot;. The remainder are delayed open access journals, having free access after a two-year rolling period.

The AGU hosts a number of blogs, collectively known as the AGU Blogosphere, informally publishing frequent updates on the Earth and space sciences.

=== Texaco copyright case ===

AGU publications are copyrighted, but in the United States many exceptions to the exclusive rights of copyright are allowed under the fair use provision, part of the Copyright Act of 1976. Making copies of publications are allowed for such uses as teaching and research as long as a set of four criteria are met. However, when Texaco&#x27;s corporate library made systematic copies of journal articles for its collection, AGU and five other publishers took Texaco to court. The judges found for AGU. Texaco was fined and agreed to retroactively purchase a license from the Copyright Clearance Center.

===Executive directors===
While more than 40 presidents have provided scientific leadership for the AGU since 1919, operational leadership has been provided by a larger team. The first senior team member was John Adam Fleming, who was elected Secretary in 1925 and changed the name of his position to General Secretary. He served as a volunteer while working at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution. By 1943, with the membership nearing 2,000, AGU recognized the need for a full-time professional administrator. The post was renamed Executive Secretary and Waldo E. Smith was hired. He served until 1970 and then Athelstan Spilhaus, Jr. was hired as executive director. Christine McEntee replaced him in 2010. Medals have been named after Fleming and Smith. The AGU leadership in 2021 included, in addition to the president, a CEO, 4 executive vice presidents, 6 vice presidents, 7 directors, and a chief digital officer.

== Sections ==
The AGU is divided into 25 sections that provide the main structure for managing volunteers, developing leaders and honoring scientists. These sections also reflect the breadth of science within Earth and space science: atmospheric and space electricity; atmospheric sciences; biogeosciences; cryosphere sciences; Earth and planetary surface processes; Earth and space science informatics; education; geodesy; geohealth; geomagnetism; paleomagnetism and electromagnetism; hydrology; mineral and rock physics; natural hazards; near surface geophysics; nonlinear geophysics; ocean sciences; paleoceanography; planetary sciences; seismology; societal impacts and policy sciences; space physics and aeronomy; study of the Earth&#x27;s deep interior; tectonophysics; volcanology, geochemistry, and petrology.

== Meetings ==

AGU holds an annual meeting every December (known as the Fall Meeting). Until 2017, the meeting was held yearly in San Francisco. Because of renovations at the San Francisco venue, the 2017 meeting took place in New Orleans and the 2018 meeting in Washington, DC. It returned to San Francisco in 2019 and its location will rotate among San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Previously, a second meeting was held every Spring (April through May) in locations around the world. The latter grew out of AGU&#x27;s annual Spring meeting, which had been held for many years in Baltimore, until declining interest caused AGU to move the meeting to different locations, starting with Boston in 1998. With the 2003 meeting in Nice, France, it became known as the Joint Assembly because AGU co-sponsors it with other societies such as the Geochemical Society, the Mineralogical Society of America (MSA), the Canadian Geophysical Union (CGU), and the European Geosciences Union (EGU). The Fall Meeting had more than 25,000 attendees in 2018.

In addition to the Fall meeting that covers all areas of the geophysical sciences, AGU sponsors many specialized meetings that are intended to serve the needs of particular scientific disciplines or geographical areas, including the Ocean Sciences Meeting, which is held in even numbered years. Small, highly focused meetings are offered through the Chapman Conferences.

The large numbers and international participation in the Fall Meeting results in a large contribution to greenhouse gases. The 9500 participants in the 2002 meeting traveled an average of to attend, producing 1.3 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or one-sixteenth of the average yearly emissions for Americans. The AGU has made some adjustments such as asking shuttle bus drivers to turn off their engines when they are not moving, but 95% of the emissions come from jet fuel. In an unpublished study, David Scott and Lawrence Plug of Dalhousie University estimated that the AGU could reduce emissions by 7.7% if it moved the Fall Meeting to Denver, Colorado.

In 2017, the first joint JpGU-AGU meeting was held in Chiba, Japan. The meeting was a joint effort between AGU and the Japan Geoscience Union.

== Science and society ==
On occasion the AGU Council issues position statements on matters affecting public policy that are related to geophysics. These include biological evolution, natural hazards, science education and funding, and climate change. The AGU adopted its first position statement on climate change in December 1998. That statement began

The statement continued,

After a discussion of scientific uncertainties the statement concluded

The adopted position statement was backed up by a detailed supporting document. The AGU position statement has undergone several revisions, most recently revised and reaffirmed in 2012.

In 2014, AGU developed the Sharing Science program to provide scientists with the skills and tools that they need to communicate science with any audience. The program offers resources, workshops, hands-on support, and opportunities to help scientists more effectively communicate with broader audiences about Earth and space science. Audiences range from journalists, educators and students, policy makers, and the broader public.

Members of the AGU who work in politically-controversial fields have come under legal attack. For example, Michael Mann, a Fellow of the AGU and lead author of the original &quot;hockey stick graph&quot; study, faced a legal demand to turn over his private emails from Kenneth Cuccinelli II, at the time the attorney general of the state of Virginia, a conservative Republican who argues that there is no persuasive evidence that human activity is warming the planet. The court rejected Cuccinelli&#x27;s demand. However, such legal challenges continue, so in 2012 AGU entered in a partnership with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund to offer legal counseling at the Fall Meeting.

== Scientific ethics ==
In 2011, AGU created a Task Force on Scientific Ethics, &quot;to review and update existing policies and procedures for dealing with scientific misconduct.&quot; This effort received a setback when its chairman, Peter Gleick, announced that he had lied to obtain internal documents from the Heartland Institute and then leaked them to the public. Gleick, a climate scientist and recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, said he was motivated by frustration with the efforts of groups such as the Heartland Institute to attack climate science and scientists, but admitted that it was a serious lapse of judgement. He resigned from the task force on February 16, 2012, and was replaced by Linda Gundersen, director of the Office of Science Quality and Integrity at the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

In 2017, AGU adopted and updated ethics policy, called the AGU Scientific Integrity and Professional Ethics. Among other updates, the policy updated its definitions of what counts as scientific misconduct to include harassment, bullying, and discrimination. The change came, in part, as a result of a 2016 workshop AGU convened to address the challenge of sexual and gender-based harassment, with co-sponsorship by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society (ACS), the American Geosciences Institute (AGI), the Association for Women Geoscientists (AWG), and the Earth Science Women&#x27;s Network (ESWN). Additionally, AGU staff are trained in how to address incidents of harassment at their annual meeting and wear &quot;Safe AGU&quot; buttons to signify themselves as resources.

On February 27, 2018, AGU CEO Chris McEntee testified before the House Committee on Science, Space, &amp; Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing – A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science. His testimony was alongside those of Rhonda Davis, head of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s (NSF) Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Kathryn Clancy, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and attorney Kristina Larsen.

In July 2019, the AGU was awarded a three-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to launch the AGU Ethics and Equity Initiative, a collaboration among the AGU and the National Center for Professional and Research Ethics at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The initiative will tackle issues around sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination by developing new educational resources and tracking tools to measure impact.

In December 2022, AGU punished climate scientists Rose Abramoff and Peter Kalmus for misconduct, who interrupted a plenary session of the annual Fall Meeting with a call for scientists to engage in protest against climate change. AGU removed their research presentations from the meeting, banned them from participation, launched a misconduct inquiry, and complained to Abramoff&#x27;s employer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Kalmus and Abramoff further claimed that AGU threatened to have them arrested if they returned to the meeting. Abramoff was fired by Oak Ridge in January 2023.

==Corporate sponsorship==
In 2014, the AGU accepted 5469 gifts, grants and pledges from individuals and corporations. Of these, the 1919 Society (gifts of over $100,000) included ExxonMobil, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Management International, and Nature&#x27;s Own. AGU also was found to have many annual events sponsored by corporations, including an annual Student Breakfast (supported by ExxonMobil) and Amazon Web Services supported research grants and that offer access to its cloud computing resources. In 2015, the AGU Board approved a new Organizational Support Policy. The policy covers subjects such as advertorials and member surveys. It requires that partnerships contribute to AGU&#x27;s mission, vision and goals and that the AGU &quot;apply vetting to ascertain that partners are not engaged in false misinterpretations of science.&quot;

The sponsorship of AGU by ExxonMobil became a source of concern for many members after evidence surfaced that ExxonMobil had known about climate change for decades but had actively worked to undermine climate science. On February 22, 2016, a letter signed by 100 scientists was delivered to the AGU, requesting that they cut all ties with ExxonMobil and other companies that foster climate misinformation. The AGU Board of Directors met on April 22, 2016, and voted to continue accepting sponsorship from ExxonMobil, arguing that there was not unequivocal evidence that ExxonMobil continues to participate in climate misinformation. Instead of making a short-term political statement, the Board wished to engage with the energy industry over the long term. In response, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Ted Lieu sent a critical letter saying that ExxonMobil continues to fund climate denial and is misleading the AGU. The Union of Concerned Scientists also sent a letter urging them to reconsider. However, in a meeting on September 23, 2016, the Board upheld its previous decision.

== Fossil fuel divestment ==
In November 2021, AGU announced in a video presentation that, as a consequence of its Environmental, social, and corporate governance policies, it no longer had any direct investments in fossil-fuel companies and it was beginning to divest its investment portfolio from mutual fund holdings in fossil-fuel companies.

<text>Data profiling is the process of examining the data available from an existing information source (e.g. a database or a file) and collecting statistics or informative summaries about that data. The purpose of these statistics may be to:
# Find out whether existing data can be easily used for other purposes
# Improve the ability to search data by tagging it with keywords, descriptions, or assigning it to a category
# Assess data quality, including whether the data conforms to particular standards or patterns
# Assess the risk involved in integrating data in new applications, including the challenges of joins
# Discover metadata of the source database, including value patterns and distributions, key candidates, foreign-key candidates, and functional dependencies
# Assess whether known metadata accurately describes the actual values in the source database
# Understanding data challenges early in any data intensive project, so that late project surprises are avoided. Finding data problems late in the project can lead to delays and cost overruns.
# Have an enterprise view of all data, for uses such as master data management, where key data is needed, or data governance for improving data quality.

==Introduction==

Data profiling refers to the analysis of information for use in a data warehouse in order to clarify the structure, content, relationships, and derivation rules of the data. Profiling helps to not only understand anomalies and assess data quality, but also to discover, register, and assess enterprise metadata. The result of the analysis is used to determine the suitability of the candidate source systems, usually giving the basis for an early go/no-go decision, and also to identify problems for later solution design.

==How data profiling is conducted==

Data profiling utilizes methods of descriptive statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, mode, percentile, standard deviation, frequency, variation, aggregates such as count and sum, and additional metadata information obtained during data profiling such as data type, length, discrete values, uniqueness, occurrence of null values, typical string patterns, and abstract type recognition. The metadata can then be used to discover problems such as illegal values, misspellings, missing values, varying value representation, and duplicates.

Different analyses are performed for different structural levels. E.g. single columns could be profiled individually to get an understanding of frequency distribution of different values, type, and use of each column. Embedded value dependencies can be exposed in a cross-columns analysis. Finally, overlapping value sets possibly representing foreign key relationships between entities can be explored in an inter-table analysis.

Normally, purpose-built tools are used for data profiling to ease the process. The computation complexity increases when going from single column, to single table, to cross-table structural profiling. Therefore, performance is an evaluation criterion for profiling tools.

==When is data profiling conducted?==

According to Kimball, data profiling is performed several times and with varying intensity throughout the data warehouse developing process. A light profiling assessment should be undertaken immediately after candidate source systems have been identified and DW/BI business requirements have been satisfied. The purpose of this initial analysis is to clarify at an early stage if the correct data is available at the appropriate detail level and that anomalies can be handled subsequently. If this is not the case the project may be terminated.

Additionally, more in-depth profiling is done prior to the dimensional modeling process in order assess what is required to convert data into a dimensional model. Detailed profiling extends into the ETL system design process in order to determine the appropriate data to extract and which filters to apply to the data set.

Additionally, data profiling may be conducted in the data warehouse development process after data has been loaded into staging, the data marts, etc. Conducting data at these stages helps ensure that data cleaning and transformations have been done correctly and in compliance of requirements.

==Benefits and examples==

The benefits of data profiling are to improve data quality, shorten the implementation cycle of major projects, and improve users&#x27; understanding of data. Discovering business knowledge embedded in data itself is one of the significant benefits derived from data profiling. Data profiling is one of the most effective technologies for improving data accuracy in corporate databases.

<text>Construct validity concerns how well a set of indicators represent or reflect a concept that is not directly measurable. &quot;Construct validation&quot; is the accumulation of evidence to support the interpretation of what a measure reflects. Modern validity theory defines construct validity as the overarching concern of validity research, subsuming all other types of validity evidence such as content validity and criterion validity.

Construct validity is the appropriateness of inferences made on the basis of observations or measurements (often test scores), specifically whether a test can reasonably be considered to reflect the intended construct. Constructs are abstractions that are deliberately created by researchers in order to conceptualize the latent variable, which is correlated with scores on a given measure (although it is not directly observable). Construct validity examines the question: Does the measure behave like the theory says a measure of that construct should behave?

Construct validity is essential to the perceived overall validity of the test. Construct validity is particularly important in the social sciences, psychology, psychometrics and language studies.

Psychologists such as Samuel Messick (1998) have pushed for a unified view of construct validity &quot;...as an integrated evaluative judgment of the degree to which empirical evidence and theoretical rationales support the adequacy and appropriateness of inferences and actions based on test scores...&quot; While Messick&#x27;s views are popularized in educational measurement and originated in a career around explaining validity in the context of the testing industry, a definition more in line with foundational psychological research, supported by data-driven empirical studies that emphasize statistical and causal reasoning was given by (Borsboom et al., 2004).

Key to construct validity are the theoretical ideas behind the trait under consideration, i.e. the concepts that organize how aspects of personality, intelligence, etc. are viewed. Paul Meehl states that, &quot;The best construct is the one around which we can build the greatest number of inferences, in the most direct fashion.&quot;

Scale purification, i.e. &quot;the process of eliminating items from multi-item scales&quot; (Wieland et al., 2017) can influence construct validity. A framework presented by Wieland et al. (2017) highlights that both statistical and judgmental criteria need to be taken under consideration when making scale purification decisions.

== History ==
Throughout the 1940s scientists had been trying to come up with ways to validate experiments prior to publishing them. The result of this was a plethora of different validities (intrinsic validity, face validity, logical validity, empirical validity, etc.). This made it difficult to tell which ones were actually the same and which ones were not useful at all. Until the middle of the 1950s, there were very few universally accepted methods to validate psychological experiments. The main reason for this was because no one had figured out exactly which qualities of the experiments should be looked at before publishing. Between 1950 and 1954 the APA Committee on Psychological Tests met and discussed the issues surrounding the validation of psychological experiments.

Around this time the term construct validity was first coined by Paul Meehl and Lee Cronbach in their seminal article &quot;Construct Validity In Psychological Tests&quot;. They noted the idea that construct validity was not new at that point; rather, it was a combination of many different types of validity dealing with theoretical concepts. They proposed the following three steps to evaluate construct validity:
# articulating a set of theoretical concepts and their interrelations
# developing ways to measure the hypothetical constructs proposed by the theory
# empirically testing the hypothesized relations

Many psychologists noted that an important role of construct validation in psychometrics was that it placed more emphasis on theory as opposed to validation. This emphasis was designed to address a core requirement that validation include some demonstration that the test measures the theoretical construct it purported to measure. Construct validity has three aspects or components: the substantive component, structural component, and external component. They are closely related to three stages in the test construction process: constitution of the pool of items, analysis and selection of the internal structure of the pool of items, and correlation of test scores with criteria and other variables.

In the 1970s there was growing debate between theorists who began to see construct validity as the dominant model pushing towards a more unified theory of validity, and those who continued to work from multiple validity frameworks. Many psychologists and education researchers saw &quot;predictive, concurrent, and content validities as essentially &quot;ad hoc&quot;, construct validity was the whole of validity from a scientific point of view&quot; In the 1974 version of &quot;The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing&quot; the inter-relatedness of the three different aspects of validity was recognized: &quot;These aspects of validity can be discussed independently, but only for convenience. They are interrelated operationally and logically; only rarely is one of them alone important in a particular situation&quot;.

In 1989 Messick presented a new conceptualization of construct validity as a unified and multi-faceted concept. Under this framework, all forms of validity are connected to and are dependent on the quality of the construct. He noted that a unified theory was not his own idea, but rather the culmination of debate and discussion within the scientific community over the preceding decades. There are six aspects of construct validity in Messick&#x27;s unified theory of construct validity: 
#Consequential – What are the potential risks if the scores are invalid or inappropriately interpreted? Is the test still worthwhile given the risks?
#Content – Do test items appear to be measuring the construct of interest?
#Substantive – Is the theoretical foundation underlying the construct of interest sound?
#Structural – Do the interrelationships of dimensions measured by the test correlate with the construct of interest and test scores?
#External – Does the test have convergent, discriminant, and predictive qualities?
#Generalizability – Does the test generalize across different groups, settings and tasks?

How construct validity should properly be viewed is still a subject of debate for validity theorists. The core of the difference lies in an epistemological difference between positivist and postpositivist theorists.

== Evaluation ==
Evaluation of construct validity requires that the correlations of the measure be examined in regard to variables that are known to be related to the construct (purportedly measured by the instrument being evaluated or for which there are theoretical grounds for expecting it to be related). This is consistent with the multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM) of examining construct validity described in Campbell and Fiske&#x27;s landmark paper (1959). There are other methods to evaluate construct validity besides MTMM. It can be evaluated through different forms of factor analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM), and other statistical evaluations. It is important to note that a single study does not prove construct validity. Rather it is a continuous process of evaluation, reevaluation, refinement, and development. Correlations that fit the expected pattern contribute evidence of construct validity. Construct validity is a judgment based on the accumulation of correlations from numerous studies using the instrument being evaluated.

Most researchers attempt to test the construct validity before the main research. To do this pilot studies may be utilized. Pilot studies are small scale preliminary studies aimed at testing the feasibility of a full-scale test. These pilot studies establish the strength of their research and allow them to make any necessary adjustments. Another method is the known-groups technique, which involves administering the measurement instrument to groups expected to differ due to known characteristics. Hypothesized relationship testing involves logical analysis based on theory or prior research. Intervention studies are yet another method of evaluating construct validity. Intervention studies where a group with low scores in the construct is tested, taught the construct, and then re-measured can demonstrate a test&#x27;s construct validity. If there is a significant difference pre-test and post-test, which are analyzed by statistical tests, then this may demonstrate good construct validity.

===Convergent and discriminant validity===

Convergent and discriminant validity are the two subtypes of validity that make up construct validity. Convergent validity refers to the degree to which two measures of constructs that theoretically should be related, are in fact related. In contrast, discriminant validity tests whether concepts or measurements that are supposed to be unrelated are, in fact, unrelated. Take, for example, a construct of general happiness. If a measure of general happiness had convergent validity, then constructs similar to happiness (satisfaction, contentment, cheerfulness, etc.) should relate positively to the measure of general happiness. If this measure has discriminant validity, then constructs that are not supposed to be related positively to general happiness (sadness, depression, despair, etc.) should not relate to the measure of general happiness. Measures can have one of the subtypes of construct validity and not the other. Using the example of general happiness, a researcher could create an inventory where there is a very high positive correlation between general happiness and contentment, but if there is also a significant positive correlation between happiness and depression, then the measure&#x27;s construct validity is called into question. The test has convergent validity but not discriminant validity.

=== Nomological network ===

Lee Cronbach and Paul Meehl (1955) proposed that the development of a nomological net was essential to the measurement of a test&#x27;s construct validity. A nomological network defines a construct by illustrating its relation to other constructs and behaviors. It is a representation of the concepts (constructs) of interest in a study, their observable manifestations, and the interrelationship among them. It examines whether the relationships between similar construct are considered with relationships between the observed measures of the constructs. A thorough observation of constructs relationships to each other it can generate new constructs. For example, intelligence and working memory are considered highly related constructs. Through the observation of their underlying components psychologists developed new theoretical constructs such as: controlled attention and short term loading. Creating a nomological net can also make the observation and measurement of existing constructs more efficient by pinpointing errors. Researchers have found that studying the bumps on the human skull (phrenology) are not indicators of intelligence, but volume of the brain is. Removing the theory of phrenology from the nomological net of intelligence and adding the theory of brain mass evolution, constructs of intelligence are made more efficient and more powerful. The weaving of all of these interrelated concepts and their observable traits creates a &quot;net&quot; that supports their theoretical concept. For example, in the nomological network for academic achievement, we would expect observable traits of academic achievement (i.e. GPA, SAT, and ACT scores) to relate to the observable traits for studiousness (hours spent studying, attentiveness in class, detail of notes). If they do not then there is a problem with measurement (of academic achievement or studiousness), or with the purported theory of achievement. If they are indicators of one another then the nomological network, and therefore the constructed theory, of academic achievement is strengthened. Although the nomological network proposed a theory of how to strengthen constructs, it doesn&#x27;t tell us how we can assess the construct validity in a study.

=== Multitrait-multimethod matrix ===

The multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM) is an approach to examining construct validity developed by Campbell and Fiske (1959). This model examines convergence (evidence that different measurement methods of a construct give similar results) and discriminability (ability to differentiate the construct from other related constructs). It measures six traits: the evaluation of convergent validity, the evaluation of discriminant (divergent) validity, trait-method units, multitrait-multimethods, truly different methodologies, and trait characteristics. This design allows investigators to test for: &quot;convergence across different measures...of the same &#x27;thing&#x27;...and for divergence between measures...of related but conceptually distinct &#x27;things&#x27;.

==Threats to construct validity==
Apparent construct validity can be misleading due to a range of problems in hypothesis formulation and experimental design.
* Hypothesis guessing: If the participant knows, or guesses, the desired end-result, the participant&#x27;s actions may change. An example is the Hawthorne effect: in a 1925 industrial ergonomics study conducted at the Hawthorne Works factory outside Chicago, experimenters observed that both lowering &quot;and&quot; brightening the ambient light levels improved worker productivity. They eventually determined the basis for this paradoxical result: workers who were aware of being observed worked harder no matter what the change in the environment.
* Bias in experimental design (intentional or unintentional). An example of this is provided in Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;. Among the questions used around the time of World War I in the battery used to measure intelligence was &quot;In which city do the Dodgers play?&quot; (they were then based in Brooklyn). Recent immigrants to the US from Eastern Europe unfamiliar with the sport of baseball got the answer wrong, and this was used to infer that Eastern Europeans had lower intelligence. The question did not measure intelligence: it only measured how long one had lived in the US and become accultured to a popular pastime.
* Researcher expectations may be communicated unintentionally to the participants non-verbally, eliciting the desired effect. To control for this possibility, double-blind experimental designs should be used where possible. That is, the evaluator of a particular participant should be unaware of what intervention has been performed on that particular participant or should be independent of the experimenter.
* Defining predicted outcome too narrowly. For instance, using only job satisfaction to measure happiness will exclude relevant information from outside the workplace. 
* Confounding variables (covariates): The root cause for the observed effects may be due to variables that have not been considered or measured.

An in-depth exploration of the threats to construct validity is presented in Trochim.

<doc id="794346" wikidata="Q284678" url="?curid=794346" title="Iconv">
<text>In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, iconv (an abbreviation of internationalization conversion) is a command-line program and a standardized application programming interface (API) used to convert between different character encodings. &quot;It can convert from any of these encodings to any other, through Unicode conversion.&quot;

== History ==
Initially appearing on the HP-UX operating system,codice_1 as well as the utility was standardized within XPG4 and is part of the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).

== Implementations ==
Most Linux distributions provide an implementation, either from the GNU Standard C Library (included since version 2.1, February 1999), or the more traditional GNU codice_2, for systems based on other Standard C Libraries.

The codice_3 function on both is licensed as LGPL, so it is linkable with closed source applications.

Unlike the libraries, the codice_3 utility is licensed under GPL in both implementations.
The GNU libiconv implementation is portable, and can be used on various UNIX-like and non-UNIX systems. Version 0.3 dates from December 1999.

The uconv utility from International Components for Unicode provides an iconv-compatible command-line syntax for transcoding.

Most BSD systems use NetBSD&#x27;s implementation, which first appeared in December 2004.

The musl C library implements the codice_3 function with support for all encodings specified by the WHATWG Encoding Standard.

=== Support ===
Currently, over a hundred different character encodings are supported in the GNU variant.

=== Ports ===
Under Microsoft Windows, the iconv library and the utility is provided by GNU&#x27;s libiconv found in Cygwin and GnuWin32 environments; there is also a &quot;purely Win32&quot; implementation called &quot;win-iconv&quot; that uses Windows&#x27; built-in routines for conversion. The iconv function is also available for many programming languages.

The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

== Usage ==
codice_6 can be converted from ISO-8859-1 to current locale and output to codice_7 using:
iconv -f iso-8859-1
An input file codice_8 can be converted from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 and output to output file codice_9 using:
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 &lt;infile&gt; -o &lt;outfile&gt;

<doc id="794350" wikidata="Q7239678" url="?curid=794350" title="Predictive validity">
<text>In psychometrics, predictive validity is the extent to which a score on a scale or test predicts scores on some criterion measure.

For example, the validity of a cognitive test for job performance is the correlation between test scores and, for example, supervisor performance ratings. Such a cognitive test would have &quot;predictive validity&quot; if the observed correlation were statistically significant.

Predictive validity shares similarities with concurrent validity in that both are generally measured as correlations between a test and some criterion measure. In a study of concurrent validity the test is administered at the same time as the criterion is collected. This is a common method of developing validity evidence for employment tests: A test is administered to incumbent employees, then a rating of those employees&#x27; job performance is, or has already been, obtained independently of the test (often, as noted above, in the form of a supervisor rating). Note the possibility for restriction of range both in test scores and performance scores: The incumbent employees are likely to be a more homogeneous and higher performing group than the applicant pool at large.

In a strict study of predictive validity, the test scores are collected first. Then, at some later time the criterion measure is collected. Thus, for predictive validity, the employment test example is slightly different: Tests are administered, perhaps to job applicants, and then after those individuals work in the job for a year, their test scores are correlated with their first year job performance scores. Another relevant example is SAT scores: These are validated by collecting the scores during the examinee&#x27;s senior year and high school and then waiting a year (or more) to correlate the scores with their first year college grade point average. Thus predictive validity provides somewhat more useful data about test validity because it has greater fidelity to the real situation in which the test will be used. After all, most tests are administered to find out something about future behavior.

As with many aspects of social science, the magnitude of the correlations obtained from predictive validity studies is usually not high. A typical predictive validity for an employment test might obtain a correlation in the neighborhood of &quot;r&quot; = .35. Higher values are occasionally seen and lower values are very common. Nonetheless, the utility (that is the benefit obtained by making decisions using the test) provided by a test with a correlation of .35 can be quite substantial. More information, and an explanation of the relationship between variance and predictive validity, can be found here.

==Predictive validity in modern validity theory==

The latest &quot;Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing&quot; reflect Samuel Messick&#x27;s model of validity and do not use the term &quot;predictive validity.&quot; Rather, the &quot;Standards&quot; describe validity-supporting &quot;Evidence Based on Relationships [between the test scores and] Other Variables.&quot;

Predictive validity involves testing a group of subjects for a certain construct, and then comparing them with results obtained at some point in the future.

<text>Order and Justice (, TT), formerly the Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberalų Demokratų Partija&quot;, LDP) was a right-wing national-conservative political party in Lithuania that self-identified as &quot;left-of-centre&quot;, at least on economic matters. It had eight members in the Seimas, the unicameral Lithuanian parliament, as of the last election it participated in (2016).

Formed as the &#x27;Liberal Democratic Party&#x27; in 2002, the party achieved almost immediate success with the election of leader Rolandas Paksas as President of Lithuania within its first year. Paksas&#x27;s impeachment led to the party reorganising itself as &#x27;Order and Justice&#x27; to compete in the 2004 parliamentary election. Since then, it was the fourth-largest party in the Seimas, and finished third in the elections to the European Parliament and to the presidency.

The party sat on the right, possessed a radical and anti-establishment identity, and has been described as both socially conservative and &#x27;liberal&#x27; or &#x27;right-liberal&#x27;, in line with its original identity. Its support was strongest in the north-west Samogitia region. The party&#x27;s two MEPs sat in the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament, with the party having previously belonged to the now-defunct Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) and Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) groups.

In 2020, the party chairman Remigijus Žemaitaitis signed an agreement with the chairman of the Lithuanian Freedom Union (Liberals), Artūras Zuokas, and former MP Arturas Paulauskas to unite their political movements to form the Freedom and Justice party. Žemaitaitis was later expelled from said party and founded a new party called Dawn of Nemunas.

==History==

===Early years (2002–2004)===
After being defeated in the leadership election for the Liberal Union, Rolandas Paksas founded the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 2002, taking with him 13 of his supporters from Liberal parliamentary group in the Seimas, making the party the fourth-largest party. Nationally, founders of the new party were not only Liberal Union&#x27;s members. It attracted members of Lithuanian Centre Union (e. g. Kęstutis Trečiokas) and New Union (Social Liberals).

Paksas finished second in the first round of the presidential election on 22 December, with 19.7%: qualifying him for a run-off against incumbent President Valdas Adamkus. For the run-off, Paksas represented a youthful alternative to the ageing candidate, adopting the slogan &#x27;Vote for Change&#x27;; despite all the parties except the LDP backing Adamkus, he won across almost all of the country, with 54.7%. The campaign was likened to the previous spring&#x27;s French presidential election and Paksas to Jean-Marie Le Pen for his populism. However, unlike Le Pen, the Paksas immediately announced his support for Lithuania&#x27;s ongoing process of accession to the European Union and NATO.

In June, 2003, Paksas set about fighting political corruption that saw 700 public officials under the old administration acquire land illegally. However, this was soon overshadowed by revelations in October that Paksas gave citizenship to, and heard requests for political favours from, Yury Borisov, a Russian businessman that had donated $400,000 to Paksas&#x27;s campaign, and that high-ranking members of Paksas&#x27;s staff had connections to Russian criminal groups. Although Paksas was found not to have been influenced by the criminals, his staff had been; Paksas offered that his six close advisers named in the report resign, but calls for Paksas himself to resign mounted.

Paksas alleged that the parliamentary commission set up to investigate the claims was set up for political reasons, and refused to cooperate. In response, the four other parties (Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, New Union (Social Liberals), Liberal and Centre Union and Homeland Union) initiated impeachment proceedings. In December, the Constitutional Court ruled that granting citizenship to Borisovas was illegal and impeachable. Despite this, Paksas remained popular with the public. On 6 April 2004, the Seimas voted to impeach him and remove him from office on three counts with 86, 86, and 89 MPs voting to impeach, with 85 required. Nonetheless, after his impeachment, he was tried in the criminal courts, and acquitted on all charges. The Constitutional Court found that Paksas shall be precluded for life from being elected as president, as a member of the Seimas and some other high-ranking official positions. Paksas complained against the lifetime duration of the impeachment and filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg). In January 2011 the Court rendered his judgement in favor of Paksas. In spite of the Conventual obligation to fulfill Judgements of the Court and in spite of enforcement proceedings by the Council of Europe the Judgement of the European Court of Human Rights has not been fulfilled. In 2012 Paksas complained to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In March 2014 the Committee found that the lifelong disqualification from political office violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As of 2018 the violations of Human Rights as found by the European Court of Human Rights and the UN Committee on Human Rights still persist.

===Recovery (2004–2006)===
Another presidential election was scheduled to elect a replacement for Paksas. The LDP nominated Paksas, giving the people a referendum on his impeachment. Whilst his nomination was initially accepted, it was then thrown out by the Constitutional Court, leaving the LDP without a nominee in the election. In the first election to the European Parliament, the LDP won 6.8% of the vote, and one seat. The member of the European Parliament from the Lithuanian Liberal Democratic party was Rolandas Pavilionis, a former rector of Vilnius University. He joined the Union for Europe of the Nations.

Throughout Paksas&#x27;s scandal and impeachment, the Liberal Democrats presented soft opposition to the governing centre-left coalition, alongside the united Liberal and Centre Union and Homeland Union. In the parliamentary election in October, the LDP formed a coalition called &quot;Coalition for Rolandas Paksas &#x27;For Order and Justice&#x27; &quot;, which was successful in winning 11 seats. However, the centre-left coalition managed to hold on to power, thanks to a failure of the centre-right parties to agree to cooperate.

===Renaming and joining the government (2006–2016)===
The congress of the party, held on 13 May 2006, declared, that the party had passed a difficult stage of its establishment successively, encouraging people of Lithuania to constantly oppose corruption and power misapplication in the country and changing the name of the party to &#x27;Order and Justice&#x27;. The formal reason for changing the name was the fact that four different political groups used the word &#x27;liberal&#x27; in their names. According to unofficial views of some party members, the new name mirrors the party&#x27;s more conservative position than when it was founded in 2002.

In the 2007 municipal elections, although the party was disappointed with the general results, it won a plurality in Vilnius, and formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (LSDP) under mayor Juozas Imbrasas. This was despite Law and Order members of the Seimas then supporting motions of no confidence in several LSDP cabinet members for handling of the privatisation of Alita.

The Order and Justice Party ran in the 2008 election to the Seimas with a tactic of decontaminating Paksas, despite Paksas&#x27;s inability to hold political office after his impeachment, and released a film that was shown in cinemas nationwide. Aiming to greatly increase its number of seats and form the new government, the party saw its share of the vote increase only slightly, to 12.7%, and its number of seats increase by 4, to 15. This minor increase was attributed to the rise of the National Resurrection Party, which shared the same electorate as the Order and Justice. The dramatic doubling of the centre-right&#x27;s share of seats allowed them to form a government: including three parties, but not the Order and Justice.

At the 2009 European elections, the Order and Justice won two seats, up from one in 2004, coming third. After the election, they left the disbanding Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN), and joined the more eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD).

In May 2012, ahead of the October 2012 election, Order and Justice signed a pact with the Labour and the Social Democrats to cooperate in any post-election negotiations. The Order and Justice joined government with these parties, which lasted up until 2016.

Following the 2014 European election, the Order and Justice MEPs rejoined the EFD group in the European Parliament, which was renamed Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) for the new parliamentary term. In October 2016 election, the party fared poorly by getting 8 seats in Seimas. After this result, Rolandas Paksas resigned as party&#x27;s chairman.

===Decline and dissolution (2016–2020)===
By the summer of 2018, negotiations started between Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania and the Order and Justice considering possible cooperation between them. On September 11, 2018, those parties signed a confidence and supply agreement. On May 29, 2019, Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania and Order and Justice chairmen Gediminas Kirkilas and Remigijus Žemaitaitis announced to public that talks about expanded coalition between these parties and Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union has started. On June 7, 2019, Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance council agreed that party should join these talks, which were concluded on July 5, 2019.

New coalition lasted just for two months as the Order and Justice parliamentary group dissolved itself on September 10, 2019, when majority of the Order and Justice parliamentary group&#x27;s members founded new parliamentary group called &quot;For the Welfare of Lithuania&quot; (which by itself existed up until mid-January 2020). On September 19, 2019, this parliamentary group signed a confidence and supply agreement with coalition&#x27;s parties. On October 23, 2019, the Order and Justice had been expelled from coalition.

By the end of 2018, Rolandas Paksas left the party. By this Order and Justice lost its representative in the European Parliament. In 2019 and 2020 the party lost many notorious members (e. g. Petras Gražulis, Kęstas Komskis) by expulsions or resignations. On September 25, 2019, Remigijus Žemaitaitis proposed formation of new party called &quot;Sovereign Lithuania&quot; or &quot;United Lithuania – Sovereign Lithuania&quot;.

Prior the 2020 parliamentary election, former party members joined ranks not only in the Freedom and Justice, but also in the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (e. g. Algimantas Dumbrava) and in the Liberal Movement (e. g. most of Pagėgiai Municipality members along with the mayor, Vaidas Bendaravičius).

<doc id="794358" wikidata="Q7337601" url="?curid=794358" title="River Loxley">
<text>The River Loxley is a river in the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. Its source is a series of streams which rise some to the north-west of Sheffield on Bradfield Moors, flowing through Bradfield Dale to converge at Low Bradfield. It flows easterly through Damflask Reservoir and is joined by Storrs Brook at Storrs, near Stannington, and the River Rivelin at Malin Bridge, before flowing into the River Don at Owlerton, in Hillsborough. The Loxley valley provided the initial course of the Great Sheffield Flood, which happened after the Dale Dyke Dam collapsed shortly before its completion in March 1864.

==Water supply==
The upper river is marked by the presence of four large reservoirs, used for the impounding of drinking water. Drinking water for the people of Sheffield was provided by five small reservoirs on a site close to Langsett Road. Others were added as the population grew, but by 1830, they could not keep up with the demand. Sheffield Water Company became responsible for water supply after an Act of Parliament was passed in 1830, and their first major reservoir was completed in 1836, when Wyming Brook was dammed to form the Redmires Middle Reservoir.

Reservoir building continued as the population expanded further, and the Dale Dyke reservoir was nearly complete in 1864 when the dam failed, with catastrophic consequences for the communities below it. 250 people died in the flood, and many businesses were washed away or severely damaged. As a result of the compensation payments they had to make, the Sheffield Water Company obtained parliamentary powers to raise their water rates by 25 per cent. The company soon started other major projects, and Strines Reservoir was completed in 1869, covering and impounding 453 million gallons (2,059 Megalitres (Ml)) of water. Agden Reservoir was completed in the same year, which covered and held 559 million gallons (2541 Ml). The replacement Dale Dyke reservoir was completed in 1875. It covered the same area at Agden reservoir, and held 466 million gallons (2,118 Ml).

When powers to raise the extra levy on water rates ceased in 1887, the Sheffield Water Company applied to parliament to make the charge permanent, and to make further increases to its charges. The Corporation of Sheffield decided that water supply should be in public ownership, and submitted a bill to buy the Water Company by compulsory purchase. Both sides fought for their cause vigorously, but the committee of the House of Lords which heard the cases ruled in favour of the Corporation, who paid the Water Company £2,092,014 for all of their assets, and took over responsibility for water supply. 
Under the new regime, Damflask Reservoir was completed in 1896. This was built as a compensation reservoir, rather than for drinking water, and was there to maintain a flow in the river, which protected the interests of those who abstracted water from the river, or used its flow to drive machinery. It covers and holds 1,108 million gallons (5,037 Ml).

==Water power==
The river has played an important part in the industrial history of Sheffield, as it descends through in the between Low Bradfield and the Don, and this has enabled many mills, forges and cutlers wheels to be powered by its waters. A total of 24 are known to have existed at various times. Each mill, including outbuildings, stables and housing for the owner, was known locally as a wheel. A weir was constructed across the river, creating a pond known as a &quot;dam&quot;. A leat called a &quot;head goit&quot; fed water to a water wheel, and a &quot;tail goit&quot; returned the water to the river, below the weir. In some cases, multiple water wheels were fed from the same dam, and in others, a wheel might drive several &quot;ends&quot;, which were connected to grinding wheels, and might be leased to several tenants.

Low Bradfield Corn Mill is the earliest known installation, being recorded in documents from 1219, when it was transferred to Worksop Priory. It was destroyed by the flood in 1864, but was rebuilt, despite the fact that only £3,505 was received in compensation against the claim for £5,000. It was owned by Sheffield Corporation by 1905, and continued to use water power for some considerable time afterwards. It was destroyed by a fire during the Second World War.

There were medieval corn mills at Bradfield, Damflask and Owlerton, and cutlers wheels were in use at Wisewood in 1521, at Ashton Carr in 1549, and at Slack Wheel, near the confluence with the Don, in 1581. Development after 1720 was rapid, and a shift to heavier industry occurred from the early 19th century, with forges replacing cutlers wheels, or in some cases being built alongside them. Many of 24 known mills, wheels and forges were swept away or damaged in 1864 by the flood, but although steam power was gradually replacing water power elsewhere, most of those rebuilt continued to use water power, at least in part. Although the mill buildings have mostly gone, several of the weirs and dams remain, and there are still water wheels at Malin Bridge corn mill and Low Matlock rolling mill.

Low Matlock Wheel is first mentioned in 1732, when James Balguy leased some land to build a cutlers wheel. The size of the wheel and the number of grinding troughs were left to his discretion, and so were not mentioned in the deeds. By 1825, the site was described as having three works, the first containing two tilt hammers, the second, two forges, and the third, two more tilt hammers and a plating hammer. The site was extensively damaged by the 1864 flood, and the owners put in a claim for over £5,000 to repair the damage. The present buildings carry the date 1882, and the rolling mill is a grade II* listed structure. Water power continued to be used until 1956, after which much of the internal machinery was retained but adapted to allow electric power to drive it. Following the sale in 1999 of most of the site for development, the rolling mill was bought by Pro-Roll Ltd, who were using teams of four men to roll high-value bar by hand in 2006. An archaeological excavation of part of the site took place in 2001, prior to redevelopment.

The upper river valley is now the site of Damflask reservoir, built in the 1870s, but not completed until 1896, due to problems with leakage. It covered the sites of Dam Flask Corn Mill, which was probably part of the complex mentioned in 1219, and Dam Flask Wheel, which was variously a cutlers&#x27; wheel, a paper mill, and a scythe and sickle manufactory, between 1750 and 1861. By 1864, it was probably a wire mill, as four wire-drawers were drowned there in the flood.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Loxley was as follows in 2019.

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

The Environment Agency are hoping to achieve good overall status by 2027. The river channel is heavily modified, and this contributes to its biological status. The reservoirs at the upper end trap sediments, and prevent the recharge of gravel beds further downstream. Additionally, there are no major tributaries on the upper and middle section, to provide alternative sources of sediment. The controlling of the flow by releases from Damflask Reservoir and some high flow or spill events have further removed finer gravels, leaving larger rocks and boulders, which are not ideal for fish propagation. The remaining weirs have a detrimental effect both on the movement of gravel and the migration of fish and other species. Some sections of the river have also been protected by hard banking, and near Hillsborough, by channelisation.

There is an ongoing project to improve the river for fish migration, with the focus on allowing salmon to return to the river to breed by 2020, but any work carried out will also benefit populations of brown trout, grayling, eels and lamprey. In 2012, most of the fish in the river were brown trout, with no established coarse fish. In order to achieve regeneration, an archaeological survey was carried out in 2012, examining the eight weirs from Stacey Wheel to Owlerton Wheels. The reason for the survey was that any modification to the weirs, which are historic structures, would require both planning consent and ancient monument consent. Modification would be necessary to provide fish passes at each of the sites.

Subsequently, the Don Catchment Rivers Trust commissioned the engineers Arup Group to assess how fish migration could be encouraged. They only considered the weirs from Old Wheel to Owlerton Wheel, as the weir at Stacey Wheel is very close to the reservoir dam, and would not increase the length of river accessible to fish by very much. The two weirs below Hillsborough, at Birley Wheel and Black Wheels, are the subject of a separate study being carried out by the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency also assessed the impact on the river of removing the weir at Limbrick Wheel entirely. Arup&#x27;s report considered two options at each site, from complete removal of the weir, partial removal, provision of a technical fish pass, construction of a bypass channel, easement, and the installation of a low-cost baffle system. Removal of the weir was only considered at Limbrick Wheel, and was ruled out for Low Matlock Wheel, as that is a scheduled ancient monument, and for Olive Wheel, as there is a flow measurement gauging station immediately above it. Partial removal of the weir was not thought to be appropriate in any of the cases, and only the option of easement was considered for Loxley Old Wheel. Various easement options are available, including notches and gaps, baulks, baffle systems, preliminary weirs, and rock ramps, and at any one site, several of the options may be required. Easements are generally not subject to the same rigorous technical assessment as the other options, and the process of deciding what needs to be done is somewhat subjective.

== Flood defence scheme ==
In September 2014 Sheffield Council announced plans to create a flood alleviation programme in the Upper Don Catchment area, including the River Loxley. The first phase of the Upper Don Flood Alleviation Scheme was completed in October 2023 with the removal of a weir on the River Loxley and the construction of a series of walls. The new flood defences protect 152 businesses and 63 homes.

<text>Andrew Stevenson (January 21, 1784 – January 25, 1857) was an American politician, lawyer and diplomat. He represented Richmond, Virginia in the Virginia House of Delegates and eventually became its speaker before being elected to the United States House of Representatives; its members subsequently elected him their Speaker. Stevenson also served in the Jackson administration for four years as the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom before retiring to his slave plantation in Albemarle County. He also served on the board of visitors of the University of Virginia and briefly as its rector before his death.

==Early life==
Andrew Stevenson was born in Culpeper County, Virginia on January 21, 1784. He was the son of James Stevenson (1739–1809) and Frances Arnette (née Littlepage) Stevenson (1750–1808).

He received a private education appropriate to this class, then attended the College of William &amp; Mary where he studied law.

==Career==
Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1809, Stevenson practiced in Richmond.

===Legislator===
Richmond voters elected Stevenson as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and he served in that part-time position from 1809 to 1816 and 1818 to 1821. Fellow members elected him as Speaker of the House of Delegates during the War of 1812 and he served from 1812 to 1815. In both 1814 and 1816, Stevenson unsuccessfully sought a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.

===U.S. Congress===
In 1820, Stevenson won election to the 17th U.S. Congress as a Democratic-Republican. When the party fragmented during the contentious 1824 presidential election, he first aligned himself with the Crawford faction during the 18th Congress, and then, for the remainder of his time in Congress, identified with the Jacksonians. He was elected Speaker of the House on December 3, 1827, the opening day of the 20th Congress. Reelected three times (1829, 1831 and 1833) he served until his resignation on June 2, 1834.

===Minister to the United Kingdom===

In June 1834, Stevenson resigned from Congress to accept appointment from Andrew Jackson as Minister to the United Kingdom. In June of that year, the United States Senate denied him confirmation by a vote of 23 to 22. Jackson&#x27;s opponents in Congress argued that Jackson had offered Stevenson the appointment in 1833, and that when Congress convened later that year, Stevenson had organized the House, including committee assignments and chairmanships, in accordance with Jackson&#x27;s preferences. In the Anti-Jacksonian view, this amounted to a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; that allowed executive branch interference with the prerogatives of the legislative branch. Following his denial by the Senate, he returned to Virginia and resumed the practice of law and in addition, he presided over the 1835 Democratic National Convention.

In February 1836, President Andrew Jackson renominated Stevenson for Minister to the United Kingdom. The second time around, he was confirmed 26 votes to 19, and served from 1836 to 1841.

His term as Minister to the United Kingdom was marked by controversy: the abolitionist cause was growing in strength, and some sections of public opinion resented the choice of Stevenson, who was a slaveowner, for this role. The Irish statesman Daniel O&#x27;Connell was reported to have denounced Stevenson in public as a &quot;slave breeder&quot;, generally thought to be a more serious matter than simply being a slaveowner. Stevenson, outraged, challenged O&#x27;Connell to a duel, but O&#x27;Connell, who had a lifelong aversion to dueling, refused, and suggested that he had been misquoted. The controversy became public and the repeated references to slave breeding caused Stevenson a good deal of embarrassment; there was a widespread view that if O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s charges were false Stevenson would have done better to simply ignore them rather than engaging in a public squabble.

===Later life===
In 1846, Stevenson purchased the Blenheim estate in Albemarle County, Virginia. In the 1850 U.S. Federal Census, the last of his lifetime, Stevenson owned 63 enslaved people in Albemarle County. He had owned eight enslaved people in Richmond during the 1820 federal census, and 1830 federal census.

Stevenson presided over the 1848 Democratic National Convention. In 1845 he was elected to the board of visitors of the University of Virginia, and from 1856 to 1857, he served as the university&#x27;s rector.

==Personal life==
Stevenson married three times. In 1809, he married Mary Page White, a granddaughter of Carter Braxton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. She died during childbirth in 1812, giving birth to:

* John White Stevenson (1812–1886), a Congressman, U.S. Senator, and who also served as Governor of Kentucky after the American Civil War. During his father&#x27;s lifetime, e married Sibella Winston (1823–1904) in 1843. The marriage produced five children (this man&#x27;s grandchildren): Sally C. (Stevenson) Colston, Mary W. (Stevenson) Colston, Judith W. (Stevenson) Winslow, Samuel W. Stevenson, and John W. Stevenson.

In 1816, Stevenson married his second wife, Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Coles (1789–1848), who was a cousin of Dolley Madison and a sister of Edward Coles, who served as Governor of Illinois. She died in 1848. In 1849, he married for the third and final time to Mary Schaff.

==Death and legacy==
Stevenson died at his Blenheim estate on January 25, 1857. He was buried at Enniscorthy Cemetery in Keene, Virginia. His firstborn son, John White Stevenson, followed his father&#x27;s career path into law and politics, serving as Congressman during his father&#x27;s lifetime, then as Governor of Kentucky following the American Civil War and later as U.S. Senator.

Stevenson&#x27;s manor house, Blenheim, remains today, having been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

<doc id="794364" wikidata="Q257385" url="?curid=794364" title="Specific performance">
<text>Specific performance is an equitable remedy in the law of contract, in which a court issues an order requiring a party to perform a specific act, such as to complete performance of a contract. It is typically available in the sale of land law, but otherwise is not generally available if damages are an appropriate alternative. Specific performance is almost never available for contracts of personal service, although performance may also be ensured through the threat of proceedings for contempt of court.

An injunction, often concerning confidential information or real property, is a type or subset of specific performance and is one of the more commonly-used forms of specific performance. While specific performance can be in the form of any type of forced action, it is usually to complete a previously established transaction, thus being the most effective remedy in protecting the expectation interest of the innocent party to a contract. It is usually the opposite of a prohibitory injunction, but there are mandatory injunctions that have a similar effect to specific performance and these kinds of distinctions are often difficult to apply in practice or even illusory.

At common law, a claimant&#x27;s rights were limited to an award of damages. Later, the court of equity developed the remedy of specific performance instead, should damages prove inadequate. Specific performance is often guaranteed through the remedy of a right of possession, giving the plaintiff the right to take possession of the property in dispute.

As with all equitable remedies, orders of specific performance are discretionary, so their availability depends on their appropriateness in the circumstances. Such orders are granted when damages are not an adequate remedy and in some specific cases such as land (which is regarded as unique).

==Exceptional circumstances==

An order of specific performance is generally not granted if any of the following is true:

* Specific performance would cause severe hardship to the defendant.
* The contract was unconscionable.
* Money damages are an adequate remedy.
* The claimant has misbehaved (unclean hands).
* Specific performance is impossible.
* Performance consists of a personal service 
* The contract is too vague to be enforced.
* The contract was terminable at will (meaning either party can renege without notice).
** Note that consumer protection laws may disallow terms that allow a company to terminate a consumer contract at will (e.g. Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999)
* The contract required constant supervision.
* Mutuality was lacking in the initial agreement of the contract.
* The contract was made for no consideration.
* The contract at issue was void or unenforceable. The exception to this (in equity) is in relation to estoppel or part performance.
* Where an injunction to restrain an employee from working for a rival employer will be granted even though specific performance cannot be obtained. The leading case is &quot;Lumley v Wagner&quot;, which is an English decision.

Additionally, in England and Wales, under s. 50 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, the High Court has discretion to award a claimant damages &quot;in lieu&quot; of specific performance (or an injunction). Such damages will normally be assessed on the same basis as damages for breach of contract, namely to place the claimant in the position he would have been had the contract been carried out.

== Summary of the Law in Australia ==
In summary of the law of specific performance in Australia:

When a Court Will Order Specific Performance:

# Valid and Enforceable Contract: There must be a legally binding agreement between the parties.
# Breach or Threatened Breach: There must be a breach or threatened breach of the agreement by the defendant.
# Uniqueness of the Property: The subject of the contract, especially in real estate transactions, must be unique to such an extent that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy.
# Irreparable Harm: The aggrieved party would suffer irreparable harm if specific performance were not granted, such as in cases where real property’s unique value cannot be compensated with money alone.
# Inadequacy of Common Law Damages: Common law damages must be an inadequate remedy for the breach.
# Party is Ready, Willing, and Able to Perform: The party seeking specific performance must demonstrate their willingness and ability to fulfill their own obligations under the contract.

When a Court Will Not Order Specific Performance:

# Monetary Damages are Adequate: If the harm caused by the breach can be adequately compensated with money, specific performance is unlikely to be ordered.
# Contract is Not Clear or Enforceable: If the contract terms are ambiguous, not agreed upon by all parties, or the contract is otherwise unenforceable, specific performance will not be granted.
# Speculative Purposes: If the purpose of enforcing the contract is speculative in nature, such as for anticipated profits from development or resale, courts may be hesitant to order specific performance.
# Requires Continuous Supervision: If fulfilling the contract would require ongoing supervision by the court, specific performance may be deemed inappropriate.
# Lack of Uniqueness: In cases not involving unique assets like real estate, where substitute performance or goods are readily available, specific performance may not be ordered.

==Examples==
In practice, &quot;specific performance&quot; is most often used as a remedy in transactions regarding land, such as in the sale of land where the vendor refuses to convey title. One traditional justification for this position is that land is unique and that there is not another legal remedy available to put the non-breaching party in the same position had the contract been performed. However, modern decisions in at least one common law jurisdiction (Ontario) have argued that &quot;uniqueness&quot; is only a proxy for the real conceptual justification of specific performance, which is that it is fundamentally an open-ended rule of justice and will be awarded wherever the plaintiff shows that the land in question, rather than damages, better serves justice between the parties in all the circumstances. 

However, the limits of &quot;specific performance&quot; in other contexts are narrow. Moreover, performance based on the personal judgment or abilities of the party on which the demand is made is rarely ordered by the court. The reason behind it is that the forced party will often perform below the party&#x27;s regular standard, when it is in the party&#x27;s ability to do so. Monetary damages are usually given instead.

Traditionally, equity would only grant specific performance with respect to contracts involving chattels where the goods were unique in character, such as art, heirlooms, and the like. The rationale behind this was that with goods being fungible, the aggrieved party had an adequate remedy in damages for the other party&#x27;s non-performance.

In the United States, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code displaces the traditional rule in an attempt to adjust the law of sales of goods to the realities of the modern commercial marketplace. If the goods are identified to the contract for sale and in the possession of the seller, a court may order that the goods be delivered over to the buyer upon payment of the price. This is termed &quot;replevin&quot;. In addition, the Code allows a court to order specific performance where &quot;the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances&quot;, leaving the question of what circumstances are proper to be developed by case law.
The relief of Specific Performance is an equitable relief which is usually remedial or protective in nature. 
In civil law (the law of continental Europe and much of the non English speaking world), specific performance is considered to be the basic right. Money damages are a kind of &quot;substitute specific performance.&quot; Indeed, it has been proposed that substitute specific performance better explains the common law rules of contract as well, see (Steven Smith, &quot;Contract Law&quot;, Clarenden Law ).

In English law, in principle reparation must be done &quot;&quot; unless another remedy is more appropriate.

== Legal debate ==
There is an ongoing debate in the legal literature regarding the desirability of specific performance. Economists, generally, take the view that specific performance should be reserved to exceptional settings, because it is costly to administer and may deter promisors from engaging in efficient breach. Professor Steven Shavell, for example, famously argued that specific performance should only be reserved to contracts to convey property and that in all other cases, money damages would be superior. In contrast, many lawyers from other philosophical traditions take the view that specific performance should be preferred as it is closest to what was promised in the contract. There is also uncertainty arising from empirical research whether specific performance provides greater value to promisees than money damages, given the difficulties of enforcement.

== Law and economics ==
In contract theory, economists have compared specific performance to at-will contracts. Suppose that a seller and a buyer have agreed to trade a good in the future. In the case of specific performance, delivery of the good can be mandated by the court, while in the case of at-will contracting, the seller always has the right to walk away from the contract. Hart and Moore (1988) have shown that if only at-will contracts are enforceable, then the parties have insufficient incentives to make relationship-specific investments. Subsequently, several authors such as Aghion et al. (1994) have shown that the underinvestment problem (sometimes called the hold-up problem) can be solved if specific performance contracts are feasible. However, these conclusions rely on the assumption that there are no information asymmetries. Schmitz (2022) has pointed out that if the seller may gain an informational advantage over the buyer after the contract has been signed, then at-will contracts may sometimes be preferable from an economic efficiency point-of-view.

<text>Men Behind the Sun (, literally Black Sun: 731, also sometimes called Man Behind the Sun) is a 1988 Hong Kong historical exploitation horror film directed by T. F. Mou, and written by Mei Liu, Wen Yuan Mou and Dun Jing Teng. The film is a graphic depiction of the war atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army at Unit 731, the secret biological weapons experimentation unit of the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It details the various cruel medical experiments Unit 731 conducted on Chinese and ethnic Russian prisoners towards the end of the war.

It is the first film to be classified &quot;level III&quot; (equivalent to the US rating NC-17) in Hong Kong.

==Plot==
The film opens with the passage &quot;Friendship is friendship; history is history.&quot;

A group of Japanese boys are conscripted into the Youth Corps. They are assigned to the Kwantung Army, and are brought to one of the facilities serving Unit 731, which is headed by Shiro Ishii. Soon, they are introduced to the experiments going on at the facility, for which they feel revulsion. The purpose of the experiments is to find a highly contagious strain of bubonic plague, to be used as a last-ditch weapon against the Chinese population.

Meanwhile, the young soldiers befriend a local mute Chinese boy with whom they play games of catch. One day, the commanding officers ask the boys to bring the Chinese child to the facility. Naively, they follow orders believing that no real harm will come to the boy; however, the senior medical staff vivisects the boy and keeps his organs for research. When the young soldiers realize what has happened, they stage a minor uprising by ganging up and physically beating their commanding officer.

After a revelation, Dr. Ishii develops a prototype ceramic bomb that does not kill the infectious fleas inside upon being launched. To test its efficacy, he orders several Chinese prisoners to be tied to crosses. However, the experiment is botched since the Japanese aerial forces are retreating. Chinese prisoners break free from the crosses, and attempt to escape; however, Japanese troops hunt them down, and nearly all of them are run over or shot, including several Japanese.

Unit 731 overhears the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Russia&#x27;s declaration of war. Dr. Ishii initially orders his subordinates and their families to commit suicide, but is persuaded instead to evacuate them and only commit suicide if captured. Afterwards, Unit 731 destroys evidence of their research, including gassing the surviving test subjects to death and blowing up the facilities.

That night, the Japanese troops and their families wait at the train station to arrive home to Japan. One lone survivor of Unit 731, having disguised himself as a Japanese soldier, attacks one of them but is impaled by a Japanese flag. The Youth Corps clutch onto the blood-stained flag in horror as they depart the station.

The closing passages reveal that Dr. Ishii cooperates with the Americans, giving them his research and agreeing to work for them. Years later, he is moved to the Korean War, and biological weapons appear on the battlefield shortly thereafter. The Youth Corps involved with 731 are revealed to have led hard lives after the war, with their educational background being stigmatized.

==Cast==
==Controversies==
Though Mou claims he was trying to depict historical accuracy with the film, he has been criticized by Hong Kong critics that the film&#x27;s appearance as an exploitation film negates any educational value involving a historical atrocity, and Japanese critics deemed the film as anti-Japanese propaganda. American horror critics have deemed the film as genuinely horrifying, but lacking in writing or narrative structure while agreeing with Hong Kong critics regarding its lack of educational value, and as such the film has had no official US release, even after an English dub was created for International release.

Because of its graphic content, international release proved to be difficult as the film suffered mass controversy with censors all over the world. It was originally banned in Australia and caused public outcry in Japan to such an extent that director Mou even received threats on his life. The film was given several minutes of mandated cuts to be allowed a release in the United Kingdom.

The film garnered further controversy for its use of what Mou claims to be actual autopsy footage of a young boy and also for a scene in which a live cat appears to be thrown into a room to be eaten alive by hundreds of frenzied rats. In the 2010 documentary &quot;Black Sunshine: Conversations With T.F. Mou&quot;, Mou confessed that the cat was tired after participation in the film and got two fish as a reward, that the cat was made wet with honey and theater blood (as opposed to real blood like other scenes as the rat would attack otherwise), and that the rats were licking and eating the honey only.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, &quot;Lor.&quot; of &quot;Variety&quot; declared the film to be a &quot;lowbrow exploitationer treating a serious subject, Japanese war atrocities.&quot; noting that &quot;Explosive material is dramatically potent and could have been handled tastefully, as with Kon Ichikawa&#x27;s classic films like &quot;Fires on the Plain&quot;&quot; but &quot;resorts to nauseating sensationalism, with butcher-shop depiction of autopsies on live subjects, a disgusting &quot;decompression&quot; experiment spewing intestines out of a victim and a horrendously realistic scene of a pussycat bloodily mauled by a room full of rats.&quot;

==Sequels==
The film spawned three standalone sequels:
* &quot; (黑太陽731續集之殺人工廠, 1992)
* &quot; (黑太陽731完結篇, 1994)
* &quot;Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre&quot; (黑太陽─南京大屠殺, 1995)

<text>Coke Robert Stevenson (March 20, 1888 – June 28, 1975) was an American politician who served as the 35th governor of Texas from 1941 to 1947. He was the first Texan politician to hold the state&#x27;s three highest offices (Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, lieutenant governor, and governor). In 1966, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark marker number 5118, honoring Stevenson, was placed on the Kimble County Courthouse grounds in Junction, Texas.

==Early life==
Stevenson was born in a log cabin in Mason County, the son of Robert Milton Stevenson and Virginia (Hurley) Stevenson. Although some works indicate that Stevenson was named after former Texas Governor Richard Coke, contemporary news accounts indicate he was named after Methodist Bishop Thomas Coke. Stevenson had three brothers – Bascom, Pierce, and Asbury – and their parents named each of the Stevenson sons after a prominent Methodist bishop. Stevenson&#x27;s father was a surveyor and school teacher who later opened a store in Junction.

As a teenager, Stevenson went into business hauling freight with a six-horse wagon on a seventy-five mile trip between Junction and Brady, a trip that took a week to complete. On these trips he studied bookkeeping correspondence courses, history and government by the light of his nighttime campfires as part of a plan to begin a business or banking career. When Stevenson learned about the opening of the First State Bank in Junction, he applied for a bookkeeping job but was offered a position as a janitor. Hoping for an opportunity to prove himself and move up in the bank, Stevenson accepted and sold his freight and hauling business. Stevenson worked as the bank&#x27;s janitor until he had the opportunity to fill in for the bookkeeper during an illness, and his capable performance resulted in promotion to the bookkeeper&#x27;s position. Stevenson was promoted to cashier at age twenty; he was still a minor, so he had to be legally declared an adult in order to accept.

While cashier, Stevenson began courting Fay Wright, the youngest daughter of Junction&#x27;s town physician. They were married on Christmas Eve, 1912. Because Stevenson could not afford to construct a home for the newlywed couple, he bought two abandoned houses and demolished them, using the materials from the houses to build a new one during evenings after his work at the bank. The Stevensons had their first child, son Coke Jr., in 1913 and on the same day purchased the first tract of what would become the Stevenson Ranch on the South Llano River.

Stevenson&#x27;s interests were not limited to banking. He began studying law in his spare time as a cashier and at night in the office of attorney and judge Marvin Ellis Blackburn, with specific focus on the history of law. He attained admission to the bar in 1913 and began to practice in Junction.

==Early career==
In 1913, Stevenson organized and became president of the First National Bank in Junction. As bank president, Stevenson developed a habit of sitting next to the front door of the bank so that he would be the first person his customers would see. He also became active in several other business ventures, including a warehouse, movie theater, hardware store, automobile dealership, newspaper, drug store, and hotel.

==Public service==

=== Local government (1914–1920) ===
In 1914, the Kimble County commissioners&#x27; court appointed Stevenson to the office of County Attorney for the purpose of finding and prosecuting sheep and goat thieves that were tormenting county residents. Stevenson served as County Attorney for two terms, and during his tenure sheep and goat thefts in Kimble County declined sharply.

In 1918, a group of community leaders whose priority was the construction of adequate roads in Kimble County drafted Stevenson to run for Kimble County Judge, the chief executive position in Texas counties. Stevenson was reluctant to run, but eventually assented on the condition that the group would do all the campaigning for him and that he would not be asked to run for a second term. All but one candidate against Stevenson dropped out prior to election day and he was elected by a five to one margin, with the exact count being 757 to 155 votes. As County Judge one of Stevenson&#x27;s most significant achievements was the completion of a road connecting Kimble County with Kerrville, and by extension, the railroad and San Antonio. Prior to the completion of this road there were no paved roads connecting Kimble County to the rest of the state. Stevenson retired from the county judgeship in December 1920 and returned to private life, with no intention of future public service.

=== Texas Legislature (1929–1939) ===
In 1928 after a search to find a candidate for the state legislature in their district to advocate for ranchers&#x27; interests proved unsuccessful, Stevenson allowed his name to be offered in nomination. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a conservative Democrat, and served there from 1929 until 1939. As a freshman lawmaker Stevenson introduced and saw passed a bill establishing the office of State Auditor to keep track of State expenditures, marking the beginning of a long state political career focused on economy in government spending. In Stevenson&#x27;s second term in the state Legislature he led a successful fight against governor Ross S. Sterling&#x27;s proposal to issue $100,000,000 in road bonds to complete the state highway system. In 1933, he was elected Speaker of the House; he was re-elected in 1935, becoming the first person in Texas history to serve two consecutive terms as Speaker.

In 1938, after five terms in the House, Stevenson ran for lieutenant governor. In his race for the Democratic nomination, the decisive race in the Democratic-controlled state, Stevenson offered no formal platform and eschewed the political fanfare that other candidates embraced. For this reason many questioned his ability to win the election. Stevenson would come in second place out of six candidates, forcing a runoff with Pierce Brooks of Dallas. Stevenson continued his original strategy that he described as running on &quot;principles not promises&quot; and, when the final results were in, he had won the election 446,441 votes to 400,444 votes. As Lieutenant Governor Stevenson served under Governor W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel.

=== 35th Governor of Texas (1941–1947) ===
Stevenson succeeded to the governorship on August 4, 1941, when Governor O&#x27;Daniel resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, which he won in a special election against Lyndon B. Johnson. In dramatic contrast to the flamboyant and unpredictable O&#x27;Daniel, Stevenson&#x27;s approach was so conservative and taciturn that his critics accused him of doing nothing.

In 1942, Stevenson ran for a full term as governor. Stevenson faced only one serious challenger in the Democratic primary, Hal H. Collins. Although Collins received the tacit endorsement of the extremely popular former Governor O&#x27;Daniel, Stevenson won the primary with 68% of the vote. In the 1944 election, Stevenson won the Democratic primary with over 84% of the vote, and won the general election against the Republican candidate with 90% of the vote. In both the 1942 and 1944 gubernatorial elections Stevenson won a higher percentage in the Democratic primaries than any other candidate in Texan history. Although Stevenson was pressured to run for a third term, he declined, citing the tradition of previous governors to limit their tenure to two terms.

When Stevenson left the governorship in January 1947, he was the longest-serving governor in the history of Texas and had presided over a broad and deep economic recovery during the years of World War II. His tenure was primarily marked by his return of fiscal solvency to the Texas state government. In 1941, Stevenson inherited a General Fund deficit of over $30 million. By the time he left office in 1947 Stevenson had not only eliminated this debt, but had built a cash balance in the General Fund of over $35 million.

=== 1948 Senate election ===
In 1948, Stevenson was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in the regular election. He led the Democratic primary with 39.7% to 33.7% against Representative Lyndon B. Johnson of Austin. A third candidate was George Peddy of Houston, originally from Shelby County in East Texas, who had been a write-in candidate for the Senate in 1922 but was defeated by Democratic nominee Earle Bradford Mayfield. With the top two finishers advancing to a runoff election, Peddy and several minor candidates were eliminated from contention.

In the hotly contested runoff between Stevenson and Johnson, Johnson won by only 87 votes out of 988,295 cast – one of the closest results in a senatorial election in U.S. history. (As there was only a weak Republican Party in Texas at the time, winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to election.)

Stevenson challenged the result on the grounds of ballot stuffing alleged to have occurred in a single precinct, which involved 202 disputed votes from Jim Wells County (200 for Johnson, 2 for Stevenson). The Democratic State Central Committee sustained Johnson&#x27;s apparent victory by a 29–28 vote. Stevenson was granted an injunction by the federal district court, which barred Johnson from the general election ballot. However, Supreme Court Associate Justice Hugo Black, sitting as a circuit justice, ruled that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction, and that the question was for the Central Committee to decide. He ordered the injunction stayed, and his ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court.

=== Retirement from politics ===
After the loss to Johnson, Stevenson retired to Junction. Disenchanted with the Democratic Party, he supported Republican Jack Porter against Johnson in the general election and continued to support Republicans for the rest of his life, including John G. Tower for the Senate and Richard M. Nixon and Barry Goldwater for the presidency.

==Personal life and death==
On December 24, 1912, Stevenson married Fay Wright. The couple had one son, Coke Stevenson Jr. who was born in 1913. His wife Fay died on January 3, 1942, shortly after he became governor.

On January 16, 1954, Stevenson married Marguerite King Heap. Marguerite had been married to Gordon Marshall Heap, who died in action during World War II. Gordon and Marguerite Heap were the parents of a son, Dennis. Marguerite and Stevenson were the parents of a daughter, Jane Stevenson Murr Chandler. Marguerite died March 24, 2010, in Ozona, Texas. Murr Chandler&#x27;s son, Andrew Murr, would later serve in the Texas House.

Stevenson died on June 28, 1975, at Shannon Memorial Hospital in San Angelo, Texas. He was buried at the Stevenson Family Ranch in Telegraph.

==Historiography==
Stevenson&#x27;s character became a subject of historical discussion after the publication of &quot;Means of Ascent&quot;, the second volume of Robert Caro&#x27;s best-selling biography of Lyndon Johnson, which covers the disputed 1948 election. Caro portrayed Stevenson as an honorable statesman and reluctant office-seeker, in contrast to the venal and intensely ambitious Johnson.

According to Johnson biographer Robert Dallek, &quot;Coke Stevenson was a terribly reactionary man. First of all, on civil rights, in 1942, a black Texan was lynched in Texarkana and Stevenson gave very little public response against this. And when he was asked privately about it, his comment was -- &#x27;You know,&#x27; he said, &#x27;these Negroes sometimes do things which provoke whites to such violence.&#x27;&quot;

In the April 26, 1990, issue of the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills criticized Caro&#x27;s characterization of the former Texas governor as anti-corrupt and claimed that in his gubernatorial campaigns, Stevenson had also likely forged a significant number of votes in the very same corrupt counties which aided Johnson in 1948. In one Texas gubernatorial primary, Stevenson obtained 3,310 votes in the notorious Duval County while five of his rivals split the remaining 17 votes that were tallied. In another such primary, an opponent of Stevenson won a south Texas county by a vote of 3,000 to five, and then lost to Stevenson by exactly the same margin in the ensuing runoff because of a dispute with the county&#x27;s political boss.

Caro responded to these criticisms in an essay in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; of February 2, 1991. The author asserted that rumors of vote stealing on Stevenson&#x27;s part were believed primarily by younger members of Johnson&#x27;s circle who had hardly served during Stevenson&#x27;s tenure, and that &quot;most of the politicians outside that circle who were old enough to be Stevenson&#x27;s contemporaries said he had &quot;never&quot; stolen votes.&quot; This essay also appeared as an afterword to the paperback edition of &quot;Means of Ascent&quot;.

<text>Johann Rudolf Glauber (10 March 1604 – 16 March 1670) was a German-Dutch alchemist and chemist. Some historians of science have described him as one of the first chemical engineers. His discovery of sodium sulfate in 1625 led to the compound being named after him: &quot;Glauber&#x27;s salt&quot;.

==Life==
Born in 1604 in Karlstadt am Main, the son of a barber, he was one of a large family and did not finish school, but is thought to have studied pharmacy and visited laboratories. He said that he was glad that he had not suffered the grind of high school but had instead learned by experience. He lived in Vienna (1625), Salzburg, Giessen, Wertheim (1649–1651), Kitzingen (1651–1655), Basel, Paris, Frankfurt am Main, Cologne and Amsterdam (1640–1644, 1646–1649, 1656–death). He worked first manufacturing mirrors and later for two periods as Apothecary to the court in Giessen, the second time as the Chief Apothecary, leaving because of the Thirty Years War. In Amsterdam he built up a business manufacturing pharmaceuticals (including chemicals such as Glauber&#x27;s salt). This led to both great financial success and, in 1649, bankruptcy, which is the reason for his move from Amsterdam to Wertheim.

He married twice and, with his second wife Helena Cornelius (married 1641), had eight children. His son Johannes Glauber probably helped him with his engraved illustrations.

In 1660 he became seriously ill, which has been attributed to poisoning from the various heavy metals used in his work, and in 1666 was crippled by a fall from a wagon and was confined to bed for the rest of his life. As a result, he had to sell off books and equipment to provide for his family. He died on 16 March 1670 in Amsterdam.

==Work==
Glauber conducted studies on the chemistry of wine production and had commercial success through licensing improvements. He was also an apothecary, supplying medicines and known for providing free medical treatment to the poor. He is known for his contributions to inorganic chemistry and the fact that he was able to live from the proceeds of chemical production based upon his discoveries and was thus an industrial chemist. His improvements to chemical processes and equipment (notably furnaces and distillation devices) make him an early chemical engineer.

He was the first to produce concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1625 by combining sulfuric acid and table salt. He also made an improved process for the manufacture of nitric acid in 1648 by heating potassium nitrate with concentrated sulfuric acid. His production of sodium sulfate, which he called &quot;sal mirabilis&quot; or &quot;wonderful salt&quot;, brought him fame and the honor of being named &quot;Glauber&#x27;s salt&quot;. It was an effective but relatively safe laxative at a time when purging (emptying the digestive tract) was a popular treatment for many diseases.

The chemical garden (or silica garden) was first observed by Glauber and described by him in 1646. In its original form, the chemical garden involved the introduction of ferrous chloride (FeCl2) crystals into a solution of potassium silicate (K2SiO3, water glass).

He was the first to synthesize and isolate antimony trichloride, arsenic trichloride, tin tetrachloride and zinc chloride.

In addition, he wrote about 40 books. A visionary one is &quot;Dess Teutschlands Wohlfahrt&quot; (&quot;Germany&#x27;s Prosperity&quot;), in which he proposed the chemical industries as a means for Germany&#x27;s economic recovery after the Thirty Years War.

<doc id="794390" wikidata="Q7337755" url="?curid=794390" title="River Rivelin">
<text>The River Rivelin is a river in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.

It rises on the Hallam moors, in north west Sheffield, and joins the River Loxley (at Malin Bridge). The Rivelin Valley, through which the river flows, is a -mile-long woodland valley which includes the popular Rivelin Valley Nature Trail that was created in 1967. The valley has farmland on its gentler upper slopes. Tributaries include the Wyming Brook, Allen Sike and the Black Brook. The Rivelin Dams are to be found at the head of the valley.

A relatively fast-flowing river (it drops 80 metres between Rivelin Mill Bridge and Malin Bridge), the Rivelin is fed by a constant release of water from the nearby moorland peat. Its flow was exploited for centuries as a power source, driving the water wheels of up to twenty industries (forges, metal-working and flour mills) along its course.

==History==

===Roman times===
There is evidence of Roman occupation of the area which comes from tablets found in April 1761 on the Stannington side of the Rivelin Valley which record the granting of land to retiring Roman auxiliaries of the Sunuci tribe. Other evidence of Roman occupation comes from finds on Walkley Bank Road, which leads onto the ridge facing Stannington.

===Medieval times===
In medieval times the Rivelin valley was part of a large tract of land set aside by the Lords of Hallamshire for deer hunting. It was known as Rivelin Chase or Firth and covered thousands of acres on the western upland outskirts of the parish of Sheffield. In 1637 John Harrison after surveying the area declared that the firth had an area of . of this was within Sheffield Parish with the rest in the Parish of Bradfield. Until the 20th century the River Rivelin formed the north-western boundary of Sheffield.

===Industrial past===
The Valley possesses 21 artificially created ponds, testament to the twenty mills which were once present on the river. Though most of the mills and forges no longer exist, the ponds which used to feed them do, thanks to the support of the Rivelin Valley Conservation Group (RVCG) and Yorkshire Water. Some of the more famous mills (from west to east) are as follows:

====Rivelin Corn Mill====
The mostly westerly site, stands at the foot of Rails Road. This mill dates from 1600 when it was owned by Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. By 1830 there were two waterwheels powering three grinding stones, however problems with the water supply in the summer meant that the mill was often not working at full capacity. The mill continued operating until the 1930s after which the buildings quickly fell into disrepair and were demolished in the early 1950s with a small car parking area now occupying the site. The dam wall was damaged in 1967 by dredging work and eventually collapsed in March 2001. The RVCG and Sheffield Council filled in the pond and created a new one nearby with a pond dipping platform. The official opening was on 17 May 2007.
====Wolf Wheel====
Was built around 1722 and had one of the largest wheels in the valley with a diameter of . It was owned by the Windle brothers between 1818 and 1852 who used it for grinding knives and razors, after which it was sold to the Water Company. The mill was in regular use until 1918, but a survey in 1934 revealed that the internal machinery had been dismantled. The pond that served the Wolf Wheel is still in fine condition and has received much attention from the RVCG. It is one of four dams that are used by fishermen in the valley and surrounding wildlife includes dragonflies such as the common darter &quot;Sympetrum striolatum&quot; and the common hawker, &quot;Aeshna juncea&quot;. Other wildlife includes kingfishers, great diving beetles and amphibians such as the common frog and palmate newt.

====Hind Wheel Mill====
This is oldest mill in the valley with a recorded date of 1581 when Thomas Hind, Robert Webster and John Swynden were the owners paying £1 per year rent. It was completely rebuilt around 1820 with production ceasing around 1930. In October 1936 &quot;The Sheffield Daily Independent&quot; reported that the building had completely disappeared. The present day Round Pond which served the mill is one of the most popular in the area being stocked with trout for anglers; the surrounding area has a large variety of wildlife and there is a picnic area.

====Nether Cut Wheel====
Situated near the &quot;S&quot; bend on the A6101, the Nether Cut was the last mill to work in the valley; it was still grinding scythes until 1939 and was not demolished until 1956. The mill suffered some unrest and damage during the Sheffield Outrages in 1874 for using non-union labour.
====Walkley Bank Tilt====
This began as a mill making cutlery around 1750. From 1762 it was a tilt forge making farming tools before becoming a wire mill in 1901. In the 1920s it was converted to electrical power. It was one of the last mills in the valley to close as it was still working in the 1950s. The area around the dam has been upgraded for recreational use with a small car park and bench seating. The dam is popular with anglers and has a large colony of waterfowl.

====Mousehole Forge====
Located close to Malin Bridge, the forge dates back to 1628 when it was known for iron smelting and bar production. However the forge became world-famous for producing anvils which were greatly commended and won a gold medal at The Great Exhibition of 1851. It is said that the anvil at Gretna Green was made by the Mousehole Forge. Production ceased in 1933 and part of the forge is now a private house.

====Grogham Wheel====
This was the last mill in the valley before the Rivelin&#x27;s confluence with the River Loxley. It had two waterwheels, with the largest known as &quot;Groggy&quot; being the biggest in the valley. The mill ground files and cutlery and was the only one in the valley to be damaged by the Great Sheffield Flood due to the water backing up the valley. The mill stopped production in 1933 with the buildings being demolished in August 1935 for public safety.

==Wildlife==
The river valley is home to wildlife including mallard, the dipper, the kingfisher, the long-tailed tit, grey heron and the wren. At Fox Hagg nature reserve on the south side of the river it is possible to see meadow and tree pipits, common redstarts and linnets and a number of warblers.

==Rivelin Valley Road==

Rivelin Valley Road was built in 1907 between Malin Bridge and Rivelin Mill Bridge to connect with the main Sheffield to Manchester road, now the A57. Prior to this the valley had no road, just a series of cart tracks connecting the various industrial mills. The building of the road was proposed in 1905 by the local water board, which owned the land; the Duke of Norfolk also donated 4.5 hectares of his land in the area for the project. Work started in November 1905 and provided employment for 176 unemployed men. The unemployment rate was particularly high at the time and the opportunity to provide work was a contributing factor in making the decision to build the road. Raw materials for the construction of the road were provided by Clough Field quarry on the southern slopes of the valley below Crosspool. Over 700 lime trees were purchased from Dixon&#x27;s of Chester in 1906 at a cost of £147. The limes were planted to line the road for a distance of , making it the second longest lime tree avenue in Britain. The road was opened on 1 September 1907, although work was not completed until June 1908. The final cost of construction was £30,000. Local people quickly christened the road &quot;The New Road&quot;, a name which was still being used many years later. The success of the project in providing work for the unemployed prompted Sheffield Corporation to press ahead with plans to connect the new road with the Sheffield suburbs of Crookes and Walkley. Rivelin Valley Road is now designated as the A6101.

The valley was especially loved by the &quot;corn law rhymer&quot; Ebenezer Elliott. There is a rock by the side of Black Brook with his name carved on it where he was renowned to sit and appreciate nature. Elliott wrote the lyrical poem &quot;Farewell To Rivelin&quot; in honour of the valley, with the lines:
:&quot;Beautiful river! goldenly shining,&quot;
:&quot;Where, with the cistus, woodbines are twining,&quot;
:&quot;Birklands around thee, mountains above thee,&quot;
:&quot;Rivelin wildest! Do I not love thee.&quot;

==Landmarks==
As well as industrial heritage, the valley is home to much wildlife, now protected by the Rivelin Valley Conservation Group. The upper part of the valley is flanked to the north by Rivelin Rocks. The rocks re-emerge three kilometres (2 miles) further down the valley above the &quot;Rivelin Hotel&quot; or &quot;The Rivelin&quot; on Tofts Lane. Behind the hotel is the &quot;Man&#x27;s Head Rock&quot;, a once well known rock formation shown on many postcards, now hidden by mature trees. This is the only public house in the rural part of the valley; the premises were formerly farm buildings before being converted into a pub. Another public house, the Holly Bush, is situated further down the valley, closer to Malin Bridge. One of the most distinguished buildings in the valley is the former King Edward VII Hospital, a Grade II listed building, the hospital closed in 1992 and has now been converted into apartments. St Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, a Catholic burial ground is situated at the Malin Bridge end of the valley. Across the road from St. Michael&#x27;s is the Rivelin Valley Park a small public recreation area which includes a cafe, playground and the Rivelin splash pools which were opened in July 2013 to replace the old outdated paddling pools.

== Proposed flood defence scheme ==
In September 2014 Sheffield City Council announced plans to construct a dam wall in the valley at one of two possible locations, the Swallow/Wolf flood storage area or the Roscoe/New Dam flood storage area. After public consultation plans for the Swallow/Wolf flood storage area have since been dropped but the Roscoe/New Dam flood storage area remains as an option. The dam will be over high with a wide crest. If the scheme goes ahead, it will reduce the depth of water downstream by during heavy rain such as those that occurred in 2007 United Kingdom floods when parts of the city were flooded.
This proposal is likely to be highly controversial if goes ahead:
the water retaining area would cover and potentially destroy or damage ancient and unique structures that are part of Sheffield&#x27;s industrial heritage. It would also flood allotment gardens and would require the river course to change as well as to have the span of the valley that includes the nature trail covered by the dam embankment. The culvert (a concrete tunnel - maybe barred) to take the river may have to be as long as 70 metres.
There is further debate about the contribution the Rivelin played in the floods of 2007 so the maths related to this scheme will be closely scrutinised by the very concerned public. (In the council consultation 60% of people expressing an opinion opposed this scheme - indeed it was the least popular area the council nominated).

== Artistic representations ==
In the 1920s a group of artists founded a creative colony in the Rivelin Valley. They included Ben Baines, W R E Goodrich, Robert Scott-Temple and Vernon Edmonds. A number of other artists are known to have worked in the Rivelin area.

* W. J. Stevenson (1835–1905) depicted the interior of Spooner&#x27;s Wheel in 1877.
* W. E. Smith depicted the valley from a vantage point at Bell Hagg circa1966 .
* Joseph Hallam Hawkesworth (1827–1908) depicted the river.
* G. Hattersley Pearson (1858–1937) painted Roscoe Wheel circa1890.
* Christopher Thomson (1799–1871) depicted the Rivelin, near the confluence of the Black Brook circa 1860.
* Joseph Wrightson MacIntyre (1842–1897) painted the interior of Holme Head Wheel in 1879.

<doc id="794399" wikidata="Q203445" url="?curid=794399" title="Porphyry (philosopher)">
<text>Porphyry of Tyre (; ; – ) was a Neoplatonic philosopher born in Tyre, Roman Phoenicia during Roman rule. He edited and published the &quot;Enneads&quot;, the only collection of the work of Plotinus, his teacher.

He wrote original works in the Greek language on a wide variety of topics, ranging from music theory to Homer to vegetarianism. His &quot;Isagoge&quot; or &quot;Introduction&quot;, an introduction to logic and philosophy, was the standard textbook on logic throughout the Middle Ages in its Latin and Arabic translations. Porphyry was, and still is, also well-known for his anti-Christian polemics. Through works such as &quot;Philosophy from Oracles&quot; and &quot;Against the Christians&quot; (which was banned by Constantine the Great), he was involved in a controversy with early Christians.

== Life ==
The &quot;Suda&quot; (a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia based on many sources now lost) reports that Porphyry was born in Tyre, however, other sources report that he was born in Batanaea, present-day Syria . His parents named him &quot;Malkos&quot; or &quot;Malchus&quot; (cf. Aramaic &#x27;king&#x27;). However, he changed it to &quot;Basileus&quot; &quot;King&quot;, and into his nickname &quot;Porphyrius&quot; &quot;[clad] in purple&quot; later in his life. In his work &quot;The Life of Plotinus,&quot; he refers to Aramaic as his &quot;native tongue.&quot; Under Cassius Longinus, in Athens, he studied grammar and rhetoric, and became acquainted with Middle Platonism.

In 262 he went to Rome, attracted by the reputation of Plotinus, and for six years devoted himself to the practice of Neoplatonism, during which time he severely modified his diet, at one point becoming suicidal. On the advice of Plotinus he went to live in Sicily for five years to recover his mental health. On returning to Rome, he lectured on philosophy and completed an edition of the writings of Plotinus (who had died in the meantime) together with a biography of his teacher. Iamblichus is mentioned in ancient Neoplatonic writings as his disciple, but this is most likely only meant to indicate that he was the dominant figure in the next generation of philosophers succeeding him. The two men differed publicly on the issue of theurgy.

In his later years, he married Marcella, a widow with seven children and a student of philosophy. There are around sixty works connected to Porphyry&#x27;s name, some in fragments or lost. Some pieces of his work are still being reconstructed today. Little more is known of his life, and the date of his death is uncertain.

==Works==
=== &quot;Introduction&quot; (&quot;Isagoge&quot;) ===

Porphyry is best known for his contributions to philosophy. Apart from writing the &quot;Aids to the Study of the Intelligibles&quot; (Ἀφορμαὶ πρὸς τὰ νοητά; &quot;Sententiae ad Intelligibilia Ducentes&quot;), a basic summary of Neoplatonism, he is especially appreciated for his &quot;Introduction to Categories&quot; (&quot;Introductio in Praedicamenta&quot; or &quot;Isagoge et in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium&quot;), a very short work often considered to be a commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categories&quot;, hence the title. According to , however, the correct title is simply &quot;Introduction&quot; (Εἰσαγωγή &quot;Isagoge&quot;), and the book is an introduction not to the &quot;Categories&quot; in particular, but to logic in general, comprising as it does the theories of predication, definition, and proof. The &quot;Introduction&quot; describes how qualities attributed to things may be classified, famously breaking down the philosophical concept of substance into the five components &quot;genus&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;difference&quot;, &quot;property&quot;, and &quot;accident&quot;. Porphyry&#x27;s discussion of &quot;accident&quot; sparked a long-running debate on the application of &quot;accident&quot; and &quot;essence&quot;.

As Porphyry&#x27;s most influential contribution to philosophy, the &quot;Introduction to Categories&quot; incorporated Aristotle&#x27;s logic into Neoplatonism, in particular the doctrine of the categories of being interpreted in terms of entities (in later philosophy, &quot;universal&quot;). Boethius&#x27; &quot;Isagoge&quot;, a Latin translation of Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot;, became a standard medieval textbook in European schools and universities, which set the stage for medieval philosophical-theological developments of logic and the problem of universals. In medieval textbooks, the all-important &quot;Arbor porphyriana&quot; (&quot;Porphyrian Tree&quot;) illustrates his logical classification of substance. To this day, taxonomy benefits from concepts in Porphyry&#x27;s Tree, in classifying living organisms (see cladistics). Porphyry&#x27;s invention of the &quot;Porphyrian Tree&quot; is noted as the first proper commentary made on Aristotle&#x27;s work.
The &quot;Introduction&quot; was translated into Arabic by Abd-Allāh ibn al-Muqaffaʿ from a Syriac version. With the Arabicized name &quot;Isāghūjī&quot; (إيساغوجي) it long remained the standard introductory logic text in the Muslim world and influenced the study of theology, philosophy, grammar, and jurisprudence. Besides the adaptations and epitomes of this work, many independent works on logic by Muslim philosophers have been entitled Isāghūjī.

=== &quot;Philosophy from Oracles&quot; (&quot;De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda&quot;) ===
Porphyry is also known as an opponent of Christianity and defender of Paganism; his precise contribution to the philosophical approach to traditional religion may be discovered in the fragments of &quot;Philosophy from Oracles&quot; (Περὶ τῆς ἐκ λογίων φιλοσοφίας; &quot;De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda&quot;), which was originally three books in length. There is debate as to whether it was written in his youth (as Eunapius reports) or closer in time to the persecutions of Christians under Diocletian and Galerius.

Whether or not Porphyry was the pagan philosopher&#x27;s opponent in Lactantius&#x27; &quot;Divine Institutes&quot;, written at the time of the persecutions, has long been discussed. The fragments of the &quot;Philosophy from Oracles&quot; are only quoted by Christians, especially Eusebius, Theodoret, Augustine, and John Philoponus. The fragments contain oracles identifying proper sacrificial procedure, the nature of astrological fate, and other topics relevant to Greek and Roman religion in the third century. Whether this work contradicts his treatise defending vegetarianism, which also warned the philosopher to avoid animal sacrifice, is disputed among scholars. Due to Porphyry’s work being incomplete or lost, the understanding of the piece could be misconstrued.

=== &quot;Against the Christians&quot; (&quot;Adversus Christianos&quot;) ===
During his retirement in Sicily, Porphyry wrote &quot;Against the Christians&quot; (Κατὰ Χριστιανῶν; &quot;Adversus Christianos&quot;) which consisted of fifteen books. Some thirty Christian apologists, such as Methodius, Eusebius, Apollinaris, Augustine, Jerome, etc., responded to his challenge. In fact, everything known about Porphyry&#x27;s arguments is found in these refutations, largely because Theodosius II ordered every copy burned in AD 435 and again in 448.

Augustine and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian Socrates of Constantinople assert that Porphyry was once a Christian. It is said, however, that while Porphyry did engage with Christianity, he did not believe it. Augustine made comments to Porphyry as he said he was the &quot;most learned of the philosophers, as the most bitter enemy of the Christians&quot;.

=== Other works ===
Porphyry was opposed to the theurgy of his disciple Iamblichus. Much of Iamblichus&#x27; mysteries is dedicated to the defense of mystic theurgic divine possession against the critiques of Porphyry. French philosopher Pierre Hadot maintains that for Porphyry, spiritual exercises are an essential part of spiritual development.

Porphyry was, like Pythagoras, an advocate of vegetarianism on spiritual and ethical grounds. These two philosophers are perhaps the most famous vegetarians of classical antiquity. He wrote the &quot;On Abstinence from Animal Food&quot; (Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων; &quot;De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium&quot;), advocating against the consumption of animals, and he is cited with approval in vegetarian literature up to the present day. He believed that everything was created for mutual advantage, and vegetarianism was a way to preserve universal harmony of nature.

Porphyry also wrote widely on music theory, astrology, religion, and philosophy. He produced a &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; (&quot;Philosophos Historia&quot;) with &quot;vitae&quot; of philosophers that included a life of his teacher, Plotinus. His life of Plato from book iv exists only in quotes by Cyril of Alexandria. His book &quot;Vita Pythagorae&quot; on the life of Pythagoras is not to be confused with the book of the same name by Iamblichus. His commentary on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Harmonics&quot; (&quot;Eis ta Harmonika Ptolemaiou hypomnēma&quot;) is an important source for the history of ancient harmonic theory.

Porphyry also wrote about Homer. Apart from several lost texts known only from quotations by other authors, two texts survive at least in large parts: the &quot;Homeric Questions&quot; (&quot;Homēriká zētḗmata&quot;, largely a philological comment on the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;) and &quot;On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey&quot; (&quot;Peri tou en Odysseia tōn nymphōn antrou&quot;).

Porphyry&#x27;s commentary on Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; was used as a source by Pappus of Alexandria.

Since 2006, Myschievia has been held in East Texas near Hughes Springs, Texas.

Activities range from water balloon flights, to morning yoga classes, to themed dinners, to the annual Miss Myschievia pageant. The theme for the first year was &quot;Trial By Fire,&quot; an old west courtroom-styled theme. The effigy was a tall model of the Scales of Justice. In 2006 the effigy was of the Roman Coliseum and featured several nights of spontaneous wrestling, both staged and real. In 2007 a giant head was constructed with a movable mouth. Its wild &quot;hair,&quot; made of individual lengths of 2x6 lumber, was decorated and donated by the participants, who called the effigy &quot;Unruly Man.&quot; For 2008, the theme was &quot;Burning Bridges,&quot; and the effigy for 2008 was a bridge.

=====Washington=====
* Critical Northwest (official site)
**Critical Northwest (or CNW), formerly Critical Massive, is an annual alternative arts and performance festival staged in the greater Puget Sound region of Washington. Critical Northwest was started in 2003 by Burning Man participants from the Seattle area. The Massive organization became the Massive LLC in 2004 with a board of six members. In 2006, Ignition Northwest assumed producer responsibilities for the event, their board appoints a producer each year.The original board produced the event at a local clothing-optional resort, Lake Bronson, in Monroe, Washington before moving the event to Lake Recreation Associates Campground (or LARC) in Mount Vernon, Washington in 2006, and the privately held campground of River outside of Maple Valley, Washington in 2007, returning to LARC 2008–2015 with the exception of 2013, when the event was held at the Shelton Fair Grounds. Ignition Northwest signed a 10-year contract with Masonic Family Park in Granite Falls early January 2016, establishing a permanent home for the event.The event is attended primarily by participants of the Seattle, Oregon, and British Columbia Burning Man community, with some participants coming from as far away as the United Kingdom. Much like Burning Man, Critical Northwest relies heavily on large theme camps, art, and individual participants to build the temporary village. Art grants are distributed through the local Burner-based nonprofit organization, Ignition Northwest. In 2007, approximately $7,500 was distributed to multiple art projects, over $12,000 was awarded in 2015.Many of the core values of Critical Northwest are borrowed from Burning Man, and the same short, memorable terms are used for them. Due to the fact that the event is held in the highest population density center of the Pacific Northwest region, including Idaho, Oregon, and portions of British Columbia, the event&#x27;s environment is significantly different than the Black Rock Desert. The event has been held on the west side of the Cascade mountain range in the Pacific Northwest rain forest. Consequently, the size of the event with the number of participants has been limited significantly simply for the fact that there are few venues capable of holding several individuals for a week-long event in the Northwest. Attendance has been variable over the years, with almost 1100 people in 2013, and an average of 700 participants when hosted at LARC. Capacity at the new permanent venue is set at 800 for 2016, with ability to grow well beyond 1,000.Additionally, unlike Burning Man where the central effigy of a glowing neon man stays essentially unaltered from year to year (with alteration to its base and other design elements), the Critical Massive event may not have a central effigy, or indeed a last-night event. Usually, fire performances and other exhibitions occur on the last night of the event, but are limited in scope and size due to fire restrictions, especially in the forest-fire prone mountains.

In 2017, more than 10,000 people attended, making it the 2nd biggest regional event outside the US, after AfrikaBurn.

Contraburn is an event organized by the Midburn community that takes place every year on the weekend of the Burning Man event. In 2019, 2,000 participants are expected.

==Virtual World Cyber Space==
Burn2 (official site)&lt;br&gt;
Burn2 is the original officially recognized Burning Man regional in the virtual world (cyber space). Burn2 occupies a virtual playa year-round called Deep Hole, a region (simulator or &quot;sim&quot;) in Second Life®, with extra regions added to their virtual space during its annual event nicknamed &quot;Octoburn&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
Burn2 is run by a group of volunteers that include people directly involved with Burning Man, digital artists with a genuine interest in Burning Man, along with seasoned Second Life® programmers. The Burn2 regional is open year-round to WELCOME HOME BURNERS. This digital playa is unique in that it provides a home to Burners who may not be able to travel to their local regional. Participation is from Burners from all over the world! Burn2 offers classes for those interested in building in a digital world, offers mentors for newbies, and throws some fantastic parties! &lt;br&gt;
The core 10 Principles of Burning Man are celebrated, demonstrated and encouraged. Burn2 has many of the elements of the Burning Man Event, including being set in a desert playa virtual environment. At Burn2, you will experience many of the same organized groups as Burning Man; such as Greeters- who are the first people you meet at the entrance to events; Lamplighters- guardians of the Ten Principles and bringers of the flame to the virtual playa and the Temple; Fire Dancers- the Lamplighters who give special performances at selected events; Rangers- specially trained mediators always ready to help Burners to do their best to practice the Ten Principles of Burning Man, a Department of Mutant Vehicles- those crazy art cars you see rolling around in the dust, and Fashionistas- who loudly celebrate their Radical Self Expression in wild costumes as they strut their stuff in fashion shows on the playa! Not to be forgotten, the Placement department provides layouts and placements while the DPW department teams handle infrastructural elements and builder help for the events.&lt;br&gt;
Many talented artists generously build and gift their art to this community which is open year-round with several events through the year.&lt;br&gt;

<text>Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev (, ; – 8 January 1934), better known by the pen name Andrei Bely or Biely, was a Russian novelist, Symbolist poet, theorist and literary critic. He was a committed anthroposophist and follower of Rudolf Steiner. His novel &quot;Petersburg&quot; (1913/1922) was regarded by Vladimir Nabokov as the third-greatest masterpiece of modernist literature. The Andrei Bely Prize (), one of the most important prizes in Russian literature, was named after him. His poems were set to music and performed by Russian singer-songwriters.

== Life ==
Boris Bugaev was born in Moscow, into a prominent intellectual family. His father, Nikolai Bugaev, was a noted mathematician who is regarded as a founder of the Moscow school of mathematics. His mother, Aleksandra Dmitrievna (née Egorova), was not only highly intelligent but a famous society beauty, and the focus of considerable gossip. She was also a pianist, providing Bugaev his musical education at a young age.

Young Boris grew up at the Arbat, a historical area in Moscow. He was a polymath whose interests included mathematics, biology, chemistry, music, philosophy, and literature. Bugaev attended university at the University of Moscow. He would go on to take part in both the Symbolist movement and the Russian school of neo-Kantianism. Bugaev became friendly with Alexander Blok and his wife; he fell in love with her, which caused tensions between the two poets. Bugaev was invited but was unable to attend their wedding due to his father&#x27;s death.

Nikolai Bugaev was well known for his influential philosophical essays, in which he decried geometry and probability and trumpeted the virtues of hard analysis. Despite—or because of—his father&#x27;s mathematical tastes, Boris Bugaev was fascinated by probability and particularly by entropy, a notion to which he frequently refers in works such as &quot;Kotik Letaev&quot;.

As a young man, Bely was strongly influenced by his acquaintance with the family of philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, especially Vladimir&#x27;s younger brother Mikhail, described in his long autobiographical poem &quot;The First Encounter&quot; (1921); the title is a reflection of Vladimir Solovyov&#x27;s &quot;Three Encounters&quot;. It was Mikhail Solovyov who gave Bugaev his pseudonym Andrei Bely.

In his later years Bely was influenced by Rudolf Steiner’s anthroposophy and became a personal friend of Steiner&#x27;s. His ideas covering this philosophy included his attempts to connect Vladimir Solovyov&#x27;s philosophical ideas with Steiner&#x27;s Spiritual Science. One of his notions was the &quot;Eternal Feminine&quot;, which he equated it with the &quot;world soul&quot; and the &quot;supra-individual ego&quot;, the ego shared by all individuals. He spent time between Switzerland, Germany, and Russia, during its revolution. He supported the Bolshevik rise to power and later dedicated his efforts to Soviet culture, serving on the Organizational Committee of the Union of Soviet Writers. He died, aged 53, in Moscow. Several of the numerous poems written in Moscow in January 1934 were inspired by Bely&#x27;s death.

== Legacy and literary career ==
Bely started his literary career as the author of &quot;The Symphonies&quot;, a cycle experimental prose works, written from 1900 to 1908. In 1909 he published his first novel &quot;The Silver Dove&quot;. As critics note, it is notable for its &quot;skaz&quot; techniques and its unique &quot;ornamental prose&quot;, for its &quot;ability to capture haunting, mesmerizing sense of apocalyptic doom&quot;. The novel is the first part of Bely&#x27;s unfinished trilogy &quot;East or West&quot;.

Bely&#x27;s novel &quot;Petersburg&quot; (1913/1922), the second part of the unfinished trilogy, is generally considered to be his masterpiece. The book employs a striking prose method in which sounds often evoke colors. The novel is set in the somewhat hysterical atmosphere of turn-of-the-century Petersburg and the Russian Revolution of 1905. To the extent that the book can be said to possess a plot, this can be summarized as the story of the hapless Nikolai Apollonovich, a ne&#x27;er-do-well who is caught up in revolutionary politics and assigned the task of assassinating a certain government official — his own father. At one point, Nikolai is pursued through the Petersburg mists by the ringing hooves of the horse in the famous bronze statue of Peter the Great. There are scholars who have suggested that &quot;Petersburg&quot; included ideas from Sigmund Freud&#x27;s therapeutic method. An example is the way in which psychoanalysis was used as Bely&#x27;s interpretive tool for literary criticism, and as a source of creativity.

After the Revolution, Bely wrote two psychological autobiographical novels, highly influenced by Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s anthroposophy, &quot;Kotik Letaev&quot; (1918) and &quot;The Christened Chinaman&quot; (1921). D. S. Mirsky called &quot;Kotik Letaev&quot; &quot;Bely&#x27;s most unique and original work&quot;, while &quot;The Christened Chinaman&quot; was called by Mirsky &quot;the most realistic and the most amusing of Bely&#x27;s works&quot;. He also wrote poems &quot;Christ is Risen&quot; (1918), in which he glorifies the Revolution, &quot;Glossolalia&quot; (1917), and &quot;The First Encounter&quot; (1921).

Bely&#x27;s last novel is &quot;Moscow&quot; (1926—1932), an attempt to give an image of Russian &quot;intelligentsia&quot; during World War I and the Russian Revolution. It differs from &quot;The Silver Dove&quot; and &quot;Petersburg&quot; with complex, multi-faceted characters who experience a transformation of personality. It also continues Bely&#x27;s linguistic experiments. The first part of &quot;Moscow&quot;, &quot;The Moscow Eccentric&quot;, was published in English in 2016, the other two are not translated yet.

Bely&#x27;s essay &quot;Rhythm as Dialectic in The Bronze Horseman&quot; is cited in Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Gift&quot;, where it is mentioned as &quot;monumental research on rhythm&quot;. Fyodor, poet and main character, praises the system Bely created for graphically marking off and calculating the &#x27;half-stresses&#x27; in the iambs. Bely found that the diagrams plotted over the compositions of the great poets frequently had the shapes of rectangles and trapeziums. Fyodor, after discovering Bely&#x27;s work, re-read all his old iambic tetrameters from the new point of view, and was terribly pained to find out that the diagrams for his poems were instead plain and gappy. Nabokov&#x27;s essay &quot;Notes on Prosody&quot; follows for the large part Bely&#x27;s essay &quot;Description of the Russian Iambic Tetrameter&quot; (published in the collection of essays &quot;Symbolism&quot;).

<text>LIBF is a for-profit provider of apprenticeships, degrees and professional qualifications, with students being members of the LIBF professional body. It is one of five bodies in the UK accredited by the Financial Conduct Authority to maintain professional standards for financial advisors that use its services.

The LIBF was spun off from the London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance in 2023 (which continued its other charitable activities, including the award of Chartered Banker status, under the name of the London Foundation for Banking &amp; Finance) and became a subsidiary of IU Group.

==History==
The Institute of Bankers was established in 1879. It was established by bank workers who saw a need for professional standards and education in the industry. This idea received relative popularity, gaining 2,000 members by the end of its first year. The first exams took place in 1880 and were opened to women in 1917 – a year before women were given the vote in the UK but after the degrees of all British universities except Oxford and Cambridge.

The institute gained a royal charter in 1987 becoming the Chartered Institute of Bankers and in 1993 merged with the Chartered Building Societies Institute.

In 1996, the institute offered its first degree – the BSc (Hons) in Financial Services – offered as a dual award with the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. It was the first professional award to be linked to a university degree.

The name changed in 1997 to the Institute of Financial Services. In the same year, the Certificate in Mortgage Advice and Practice (CeMAP) was introduced – this was the first qualification for UK mortgage professionals.

In 2001 the institute launched the first personal finance qualifications for young people in the UK, equivalent to an AS-level. In the same year, the Institute became the first educational body in the sector to provide electronic assessment for its regulatory qualifications.

After becoming the IFS School of Finance in 2006, the institute was granted taught degree awarding powers (TDAP) by the privy council in 2010. It was then able to award both undergraduate and taught postgraduate degrees in its own right without validation from a third-party university. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) granted the title ‘University College’ in 2013, and in 2016 the Institute became The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance.

On 31 March 2023, the institute changed its name to the London Foundation for Banking &amp; Finance, retaining its status as an educational charity, and a new limited company, LIBF Limited was created. The institute&#x27;s operations and Ofqual-recognised awarding powers were transferred to the new company on 31 March 2023. On the same date, the new company became a wholly owned subsidiary of IU Group, owners of IU International University of Applied Sciences based in Erfurt, Germany. The institute&#x27;s activities remain unchanged but, as a result of the constitutional change, LIBF Limited lost the right to use the title &#x27;University&#x27; or &#x27;University College&#x27;.

The ongoing educational charity, now known as the London Foundation for Banking &amp; Finance (LFBF) continues to award Chartered Banker status and to carry out the institute&#x27;s various charitable activities.

==Academic profile==
===Degree awarding powers===
LIBF Limited, trading as LIBF, holds UK taught degree awarding powers, allowing it to grant degrees up to taught master&#x27;s degree level. The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance&#x27;s Ofqual recognition was transferred to LIBF Limited in 2023.

===Professional qualifications===
LIBF is the provider of the CeMAP qualification, and has trained over 100,000 qualified mortgage advisers. It is an FCA Accredited Body and also offers qualifications at Level 4 and Level 6 for regulated financial advisers (DipFA and Adv DipFA). As part of its role as an FCA Accredited Body it issues Statements of Professional Standing (SPS) which are required for those practising as a professional retail investment adviser, and has a publicly searchable Professional Services Register. It also provides international qualifications in trade finance (CDCS, CSCF, CSDG and CTFC) and international banking qualifications. Members and students of LIBF undertake continuing professional development (CPD) and professional programmes in finance which can lead to chartered status.

===International centres and partnerships===
LIBF works in partnership with institutes and banks around the world. It is an academic partner of the International Chamber of Commerce, with senior members of staff contributing to several ICC taskforces.

====LIBF MENA====
LIBF&#x27;s Abu Dhabi office provides education and training to the banking and finance sector in the Gulf Council Countries, and the Middle East and North Africa region.

Since 2017, LIBF MENA has been working in partnership with Abu Dhabi Global Markets Academy (ADGMA). ADGMA and LIBF have set up a learning centre to provide education in banking and financial services to young Emirati professionals. The learning centre also publishes research, contributes to debates and forums and provides peer-to-peer engagement opportunities.

====LIBF APAC====
LIBF APAC is based in Singapore where it works in partnership with the International Chamber of Commerce Academy  and the Institute of Banking and Finance.

====LIBF India====
LIBF India was established in 2023 to provide professional and executive qualifications, certificates and customised training solutions to banking and finance professionals in the Indian subcontinent.

===Financial education in schools===
Up until 2024, LIBF offered Financial Capability qualifications specifically designed for 14 to 19 year olds in the UK, but it has announced that no new students will be enrolled for these qualifications after November 2023, and they will be phased-out by 2026.

==Initiatives and programmes==
===Research centres and thought leadership===
In 2019, The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance set up two research centres – the Centre for Digital Finance and Banking, and the centre for Sustainable finance. The scope of the centre&#x27;s work is global and addresses the interests and concerns of market participants including commercial and development banks, investors, governments, corporations or regulators.

===Young Persons&#x27; Money Index===
The London Foundation of Banking &amp; Finance (the continuing charity) carries out the Young Persons&#x27; Money Index every year – a survey that tracks the delivery of finance education in schools in the UK. It also examines the attitudes, behaviour and experience of UK students in relation to money and personal finance.

===Henry Grunfeld Foundation===
The Henry Grunfeld Foundation was established in 1994 to further the careers of those working in the City of London. The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance (now renamed The London Foundation for Banking &amp; Finance) was invited to assume control of the Grunfeld Foundation in the mid-1990s with the Board of Governors acting as trustees. The Foundation has funded scholarships for the full-time undergraduate programme, as well as learning resource provision, including the Henry Grunfeld Library at the campus in Lovat Lane. The Foundation also funds research fellowships and supports a longstanding commitment to INSEAD.

===Financial World===
&quot;Financial World&quot; is LIBF&#x27;s journal, published quarterly in association with the Centre for The Study of Financial Innovation (CSFI).

<text>Sigeberht (meaning roughly &quot;Magnificent Victory&quot;) was the King of Wessex from 754 or 755, to around 756.

Sigeberht succeeded his distant relative Cuthred, but was then accused of acting unjustly. After ruling a year he was accused of unlawful acts and removed from power by the witan or council of nobles. This council was led by Cynewulf who succeeded Sigeberht. Sigeberht was given control of Hampshire. There, he was accused of murder, driven out and ultimately killed. It is possible that this happened under the influence of Æthelbald of Mercia. His brother, Cyneheard the Ætheling, was also driven out but returned in 786 to kill Sigeberht&#x27;s successor Cynewulf.

<doc id="794436" wikidata="Q44364" url="?curid=794436" title="Cut fastball">
<text>In baseball, a cut fastball or cutter is a type of fastball that breaks toward the pitcher&#x27;s glove-hand side, as it reaches home plate. This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a four-seam fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more movement than a typical fastball. Some pitchers use a cutter to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs. A common technique for throwing a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand. A batter hitting a cutter pitch often achieves only soft contact and an easy out due to the pitch&#x27;s movement keeping the ball away from the bat&#x27;s sweet spot. The cutter is typically 2–5 mph slower than a pitcher&#x27;s four-seam fastball. In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph; the average two-seamer was 90.97 mph.

==Professional practitioners==

The New York Yankees&#x27; former closer Mariano Rivera, one of the foremost practitioners of the cutter, made the pitch famous after the mid-1990s, though the pitch itself has been around since at least the 1950s.

When the cut fastball is pitched skillfully at speed, particularly against the opposite hand batter (that is, a right-handed pitcher facing a left-handed hitter), the pitch can crack and split a hitter&#x27;s bat, hence the pitch&#x27;s occasional nickname of &quot;the buzzsaw&quot;. Batter Ryan Klesko, then of the Atlanta Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World Series while facing Rivera. To deal with this problem a few switch hitters batted right-handed against the right-handed Rivera—that is, on the &quot;wrong&quot; side, as switch hitters generally bat from the same side of the plate as the pitcher&#x27;s glove hand.

In , Dan Haren led all major league starting pitchers with nearly 48% of his pitches classified by PITCHf/x as cutters. Roy Halladay was close behind at 45%. Other pitchers who rely (or relied) heavily on a cut fastball include Jon Lester, James Shields, Josh Tomlin, Will Harris, Mark Melancon, Jaime Garcia, Wade Miley, David Robertson, Jerry Reuss, Andy Pettitte, Emmanuel Clase, and Corbin Burnes. Over the course of Kenley Jansen&#x27;s career from (2010–present) he has thrown his cutter 85.1% of the time, second only to Rivera at 87.2% among pitchers with at least 30 innings during that time period.

==Popularity and limitations==
The cutter grew in popularity as certain pitchers, including Dan Haren, looked to compensate for loss of speed in their four-seam fastball. Braves third baseman Chipper Jones attributed the increased dominance of pitchers from 2010–2011 to a more prolific use of the cutter, as did Cleveland Indians pitcher Chris Perez. By 2011, it was commonly being called the &quot;pitch du jour&quot; in the baseball press.

Some pushback has developed against (overuse of) the pitch, due to concerns that a pitcher overusing the cutter could develop arm fatigue. Baltimore Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette instructed prized prospect Dylan Bundy not to throw the pitch in the minor leagues, believing its use could make Bundy&#x27;s fastball and curve less effective.

<text>Richard Stevenson Parker Jr. (born June 4, 1952), known professionally as Parker Stevenson, is an American actor best known for playing Frank Hardy in the 1970s series &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; and Craig Pomeroy on the 1990s series &quot;Baywatch&quot;.

==Early life==
Stevenson was born on the Main Line of Philadelphia, on June 4, 1952, as Richard Stevenson Parker Jr., one of two sons of Richard Stevenson Parker Sr., an investment advisor, and Sarah Meade, an actress who worked on Broadway and in television commercials. His mother took him to a filming session when he was five years old, which resulted in him making two small television appearances. The elder Parker moved his family to Rye, New York and disapproved of the whole business. Richard Jr. appeared in a few plays at Brooks Preparatory School, but initially had no intention of becoming an actor and wanted to be an architect.

==Career==
Stevenson&#x27;s first notable screen appearance was a starring role in the 1972 movie &quot;A Separate Peace&quot;, credited as Parker Stevenson. After graduating from Brooks School and Princeton University, where he studied architecture, he moved to Hollywood and landed a role opposite Sam Elliott in the 1976 film &quot;Lifeguard.&quot;

Stevenson became well known from starring with teen heartthrob Shaun Cassidy in &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; series, produced by Glen A. Larson&#x27;s production company through MCA-Universal Television (now NBCUniversal) under license from the Stratemeyer Publication Syndicate, from 1977 to 1979 on ABC. In 1983, he co-starred in the movie &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; as Burt Reynolds&#x27;s brash race-car driving nemesis, Aubrey James. The film was a critical and financial failure.

In 1986, Stevenson starred as Billy Hazard in the television miniseries &quot;North and South.&quot; He co-starred with then-wife Kirstie Alley, who portrayed his sister Virgilia Hazard. He starred on the short-lived 1988 series &quot;Probe&quot; in the lead role of Austin James. He was part of the original cast of &quot;Baywatch&quot; in the 1989 season, returning for the syndicated 1997 and 1998 seasons. He had a recurring role as a computer tycoon on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; during the second season. He starred in &quot;Legion.&quot; In 2014, he had a guest role on the Western/mystery series &quot;Longmire&quot;.

Stevenson has been a photographer since he was young; his work can be found at his photography website.

From 2017 to 2020 he starred on &quot;Greenhouse Academy&quot; as Louis Osmond, Academy Director.

==Personal life==
Stevenson was married to his first wife, actress Kirstie Alley, on December 22, 1983, and they divorced in 1997. They adopted two children: a son in 1992 and a daughter in 1995.

Stevenson married celebrity chef Lisa Schoen on September 29, 2018, at Demetria Vineyards in Los Olivos, California.

<text>Sodium sulfate (also known as sodium sulphate or sulfate of soda) is the inorganic compound with formula Na2SO4 as well as several related hydrates. All forms are white solids that are highly soluble in water. With an annual production of 6 million tonnes, the decahydrate is a major commodity chemical product. It is mainly used as a filler in the manufacture of powdered home laundry detergents and in the Kraft process of paper pulping for making highly alkaline sulfides.

==Forms==
*Anhydrous sodium sulfate, known as the rare mineral thénardite, used as a drying agent in organic synthesis.
*Heptahydrate sodium sulfate, a very rare form.
*Decahydrate sodium sulfate, known as the mineral mirabilite, widely used by chemical industry. It is also known as Glauber&#x27;s salt.

==History==
The decahydrate of sodium sulfate is known as Glauber&#x27;s salt after the Dutch–German chemist and apothecary Johann Rudolf Glauber (1604–1670), who discovered it in Austrian spring water in 1625. He named it (miraculous salt), because of its medicinal properties: the crystals were used as a general-purpose laxative, until more sophisticated alternatives came about in the 1900s. However, J. Kunckel later alleged that it was known as a secret medicine in Saxony already in the mid-16th century.

In the 18th century, Glauber&#x27;s salt began to be used as a raw material for the industrial production of soda ash (sodium carbonate), by reaction with potash (potassium carbonate). Demand for soda ash increased, and the supply of sodium sulfate had to increase in line. Therefore, in the 19th century, the large-scale Leblanc process, producing synthetic sodium sulfate as a key intermediate, became the principal method of soda-ash production.

==Chemical properties==
Sodium sulfate is a typical electrostatically bonded ionic sulfate. The existence of free sulfate ions in solution is indicated by the easy formation of insoluble sulfates when these solutions are treated with Ba2+ or Pb2+ salts:

Sodium sulfate is unreactive toward most oxidizing or reducing agents. At high temperatures, it can be converted to sodium sulfide by carbothermal reduction (aka thermo-chemical sulfate reduction (TSR), high temperature heating with charcoal, etc.):
This reaction was employed in the Leblanc process, a defunct industrial route to sodium carbonate.

Sodium sulfate reacts with sulfuric acid to give the acid salt sodium bisulfate:

Sodium sulfate displays a moderate tendency to form double salts. The only alums formed with common trivalent metals are NaAl(SO4)2 (unstable above 39 °C) and NaCr(SO4)2, in contrast to potassium sulfate and ammonium sulfate which form many stable alums. Double salts with some other alkali metal sulfates are known, including Na2SO4·3K2SO4 which occurs naturally as the mineral aphthitalite. Formation of glaserite by reaction of sodium sulfate with potassium chloride has been used as the basis of a method for producing potassium sulfate, a fertiliser. Other double salts include 3Na2SO4·CaSO4, 3Na2SO4·MgSO4 (vanthoffite) and NaF·Na2SO4.

==Physical properties==
Sodium sulfate has unusual solubility characteristics in water. Its solubility in water rises more than tenfold between 0 °C and 32.384 °C, where it reaches a maximum of 49.7 g/100 mL. At this point the solubility curve changes slope, and the solubility becomes almost independent of temperature. This temperature of 32.384 °C, corresponding to the release of crystal water and melting of the hydrated salt, serves as an accurate temperature reference for thermometer calibration.

==Structure==
Crystals of the decahydrate consist of [Na(OH2)6]+ ions with octahedral molecular geometry. These octahedra share edges such that 8 of the 10 water molecules are bound to sodium and 2 others are interstitial, being hydrogen-bonded to sulfate. These cations are linked to the sulfate anions by hydrogen bonds. The Na–O distances are about 240 pm. Crystalline sodium sulfate decahydrate is also unusual among hydrated salts in having a measurable residual entropy (entropy at absolute zero) of 6.32 J/(K·mol). This is ascribed to its ability to distribute water much more rapidly compared to most hydrates.

==Production==
The world production of sodium sulfate, almost exclusively in the form of the decahydrate, amounts to approximately 5.5 to 6 million tonnes annually (Mt/a). In 1985, production was 4.5 Mt/a, half from natural sources, and half from chemical production. After 2000, at a stable level until 2006, natural production had increased to 4 Mt/a, and chemical production decreased to 1.5 to 2 Mt/a, with a total of 5.5 to 6 Mt/a. For all applications, naturally produced and chemically produced sodium sulfate are practically interchangeable.

===Natural sources===
Two thirds of the world&#x27;s production of the decahydrate (Glauber&#x27;s salt) is from the natural mineral form mirabilite, for example as found in lake beds in southern Saskatchewan. In 1990, Mexico and Spain were the world&#x27;s main producers of natural sodium sulfate (each around 500,000 tonnes), with Russia, United States, and Canada around 350,000 tonnes each. Natural resources are estimated at over 1 billion tonnes.

Major producers of 200,000 to 1,500,000 tonnes/year in 2006 included Searles Valley Minerals (California, US), Airborne Industrial Minerals (Saskatchewan, Canada), Química del Rey (Coahuila, Mexico), Minera de Santa Marta and Criaderos Minerales Y Derivados, also known as Grupo Crimidesa (Burgos, Spain), Minera de Santa Marta (Toledo, Spain), Sulquisa (Madrid, Spain), Chengdu Sanlian Tianquan Chemical (Tianquan County, Sichuan, China), Hongze Yinzhu Chemical Group (Hongze District, Jiangsu, China), (Shanxi, China), Sichuan Province Chuanmei Mirabilite (, Dongpo District, Meishan, Sichuan, China), and Kuchuksulphat JSC (Altai Krai, Siberia, Russia).

Anhydrous sodium sulfate occurs in arid environments as the mineral thénardite. It slowly turns to mirabilite in damp air. Sodium sulfate is also found as glauberite, a calcium sodium sulfate mineral. Both minerals are less common than mirabilite.

===Chemical industry===
About one third of the world&#x27;s sodium sulfate is produced as by-product of other processes in chemical industry. Most of this production is chemically inherent to the primary process, and only marginally economical. By effort of the industry, therefore, sodium sulfate production as by-product is declining.

The most important chemical sodium sulfate production is during hydrochloric acid production, either from sodium chloride (salt) and sulfuric acid, in the Mannheim process, or from sulfur dioxide in the Hargreaves process. The resulting sodium sulfate from these processes is known as salt cake.
:Mannheim: 
:Hargreaves: 

The second major production of sodium sulfate are the processes where surplus sodium hydroxide is neutralised by sulfuric acid to obtain sulfate () by using copper sulfate (CuSO4) (as historically applied on a large scale in the production of rayon by using copper(II) hydroxide). This method is also a regularly applied and convenient laboratory preparation.
:    ΔH = -112.5 kJ (highly exothermic)

In the laboratory it can also be synthesized from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate, by precipitating magnesium carbonate.

However, as commercial sources are readily available, laboratory synthesis is not practised often.
Formerly, sodium sulfate was also a by-product of the manufacture of sodium dichromate, where sulfuric acid is added to sodium chromate solution forming sodium dichromate, or subsequently chromic acid. Alternatively, sodium sulfate is or was formed in the production of lithium carbonate, chelating agents, resorcinol, ascorbic acid, silica pigments, nitric acid, and phenol.

Bulk sodium sulfate is usually purified via the decahydrate form, since the anhydrous form tends to attract iron compounds and organic compounds. The anhydrous form is easily produced from the hydrated form by gentle warming.

Major sodium sulfate by-product producers of 50–80 Mt/a in 2006 include Elementis Chromium (chromium industry, Castle Hayne, NC, US), Lenzing AG (200 Mt/a, rayon industry, Lenzing, Austria), Addiseo (formerly Rhodia, methionine industry, Les Roches-Roussillon, France), Elementis (chromium industry, Stockton-on-Tees, UK), Shikoku Chemicals (Tokushima, Japan) and Visko-R (rayon industry, Russia).

==Applications==

===Commodity industries===

With US pricing at $30 per tonne in 1970, up to $90 per tonne for salt cake quality, and $130 for better grades, sodium sulphate is a very cheap material. The largest use is as filler in powdered home laundry detergents, consuming approximately 50% of world production. This use is waning as domestic consumers are increasingly switching to compact or liquid detergents that do not include sodium sulfate.

===Papermaking===
Another formerly major use for sodium sulfate, notably in the US and Canada, is in the Kraft process for the manufacture of wood pulp. Organics present in the &quot;black liquor&quot; from this process are burnt to produce heat, needed to drive the reduction of sodium sulfate to sodium sulfide. However, due to advances in the thermal efficiency of the Kraft recovery process in the early 1960s, more efficient sulfur recovery was achieved and the need for sodium sulfate makeup was drastically reduced. Hence, the use of sodium sulfate in the US and Canadian pulp industry declined from 1,400,000 tonnes per year in 1970 to only approx. 150,000 tonnes in 2006.

===Glassmaking===
The glass industry provides another significant application for sodium sulfate, as second largest application in Europe. Sodium sulfate is used as a fining agent, to help remove small air bubbles from molten glass. It fluxes the glass, and prevents scum formation of the glass melt during refining. The glass industry in Europe has been consuming from 1970 to 2006 a stable 110,000 tonnes annually.

===Textiles===
Sodium sulfate is important in the manufacture of textiles, particularly in Japan, where this is the largest application. Sodium sulfate is added to increase the ionic strength of the solution and so helps in &quot;levelling&quot;, i.e. reducing negative electrical charges on textile fibres, so that dyes can penetrate evenly (see the theory of the diffuse double layer (DDL) elaborated by Gouy and Chapman). Unlike the alternative sodium chloride, it does not corrode the stainless steel vessels used in dyeing. This application in Japan and US consumed in 2006 approximately 100,000 tonnes.

===Food industry===
Sodium sulfate is used as a diluent for food colours. It is known as E number additive E514.

===Heat storage===

The high heat-storage capacity in the phase change from solid to liquid, and the advantageous phase change temperature of makes this material especially appropriate for storing low-grade solar heat for later release in space heating applications. In some applications the material is incorporated into thermal tiles that are placed in an attic space, while in other applications, the salt is incorporated into cells surrounded by solar–heated water. The phase change allows a substantial reduction in the mass of the material required for effective heat storage (the heat of fusion of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 82 kJ/mol or 252 kJ/kg), with the further advantage of a consistency of temperature as long as sufficient material in the appropriate phase is available.

For cooling applications, a mixture with common sodium chloride salt (NaCl) lowers the melting point to . The heat of fusion of NaCl·Na2SO4·10H2O, is actually &quot;increased&quot; slightly to 286 kJ/kg.

===Small-scale applications===

In the laboratory, anhydrous sodium sulfate is widely used as an inert drying agent, for removing traces of water from organic solutions. It is more efficient, but slower-acting, than the similar agent magnesium sulfate. It is only effective below about , but it can be used with a variety of materials since it is chemically fairly inert. Sodium sulfate is added to the solution until the crystals no longer clump together; the two video clips (see above) demonstrate how the crystals clump when still wet, but some crystals flow freely once a sample is dry.

Glauber&#x27;s salt, the decahydrate, is used as a laxative. It is effective for the removal of certain drugs, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) from the body; thus it can be used after an overdose.

In 1953, sodium sulfate was proposed for heat storage in passive solar heating systems. This takes advantage of its unusual solubility properties, and the high heat of crystallisation (78.2 kJ/mol).

Other uses for sodium sulfate include de-frosting windows, starch manufacture, as an additive in carpet fresheners, and as an additive to cattle feed.

At least one company, Thermaltake, makes a laptop computer chill mat (iXoft Notebook Cooler) using sodium sulfate decahydrate inside a quilted plastic pad. The material slowly turns to liquid and recirculates, equalizing laptop temperature and acting as an insulation.

==Safety==
Although sodium sulfate is generally regarded as non-toxic, it should be handled with care. The dust can cause temporary asthma or eye irritation; this risk can be prevented by using eye protection and a paper mask. Transport is not limited, and no Risk Phrase or Safety Phrase applies.

<doc id="794458" wikidata="Q13528124" url="?curid=794458" title="Malin Bridge">
<text>Malin Bridge is a suburb of the city of Sheffield, England. It is located at grid reference and stands miles north-west of the city centre where the rivers Loxley and Rivelin meet. Malin Bridge is only a small district centred on the road bridge over the River Loxley which carries the B6076 road to Stannington (in whose ward the suburb lies); it is surrounded by the suburbs of Hillsborough, Wisewood, Walkley and Stannington.

==History==
The origin of the name Malin Bridge is obscure and several possible meanings have been put forward. The most probable is that the name derived from Malin Stacie, who was Lord of the Manor of Owlerton (which lies three-quarters of a mile to the north-east) between 1607 and 1652. It is possible that Stacie built the bridge or was responsible for its upkeep and it was therefore named after him. Another possibility is that the name derives from Milne Bridge, a common occurrence where a bridge is built near a mill. A third option is that it was named after &quot;mellum&quot; an old word that relates to stones in the bed of a river.

===Origins===
Malin Bridge came into existence because of the strategic importance of the bridge over the Loxley with a small population consisting of publican, wheelwright, blacksmith and saddler springing up in the immediate area to serve the travellers who used the bridge. In the first half of the 18th century grinding mills and water-powered forges started to be built in the area to harness the power of the rivers. The best known of these are the Malin Bridge Corn Mill which still stands today and the Mousehole Forge which dates from the 17th century and was a world-famous anvil producer in its heyday.
===The Great Sheffield Flood===
In 1864 Malin Bridge was devastated by the Great Sheffield Flood with 102 people killed and 20 houses destroyed in the area. Whole families were wiped out with eleven people killed at the Stag Inn including eight members of the Armitage family as the inn was swept away. Seven members of the Bisby family were killed as the Cleakum Inn was inundated and swept away. The stone-built bridge was also carried off by the raging torrent and many of the industrial workshops were destroyed. Samuel Harrison wrote: &quot;The populous village of Malin Bridge experienced the full fury of the flood, and suffered to an extent which is truly appalling...A bombardment with the newest and most powerful artillery could hardly have proved so destructive, and could not possibly have been nearly so fatal to human life.&quot;

Malin Bridge expanded with the building of Victorian terraced housing; it became a terminus for the Sheffield Tramway with a route from the city centre commencing on 19 May 1908. Buses could be then caught at Malin Bridge for travellers continuing to Bradfield or Stannington. At that time Malin Bridge was a busy shopping area and increasing traffic meant that the original narrow bridge over the Loxley to Stannington was replaced by a wider and stronger structure. The tram route from the city centre was taken over by buses in 1952, but reinstated in 1995.
==Present day structures and developments==
Present-day Malin Bridge is centred on a busy road junction which consists of a one-way traffic loop with various roads leading off. The A6101 (Rivelin Valley Road) leads off to the south-west and after three miles connects to the A57 road which goes to Manchester. Other B class roads leave Malin Bridge for the suburbs of Stannington, Loxley and beyond. There are many small shops around the one-way system; the largest retail outlet in the area is Towsure, a sizeable outdoor equipment warehouse on Holme Lane. The Rivelin Valley fire station stands 200 yards along the Rivelin Valley Road. In June 2021, the German international discount supermarket chain Lidl opened a branch in Malin Bridge at the bottom of Stannington Road on the site of the old Rivelin Motor Company. The new store, which created around 40 new jobs was given the go ahead despite objections from some residents who said it would create traffic chaos in the area.

===Malin Bridge Corn Mill===
The grade two listed mill stands at the junction of Stannington Road and Holme Lane. The earliest written records for a mill on this site date from 1739; at that time it was used for grinding knives. It is one of the few remaining examples of an undershot water wheel in the country, it is in diameter and wide. The mill was completely destroyed in the flood of 1864 and was rebuilt by the Wilson family. Around 1915 it was converted to a corn mill by the Marsden family and operated until 1956. Since then it has been a Comet store, Chinese restaurant and a clothing store before becoming disused. In 2006 Sheffield City Council granted permission for 23 new apartments to be built on the site; the plans include strict controls to preserve the historic building and water wheel. The apartments and the restoration were completed in the second half of 2008.
===Mousehole Forge===
The Mousehole Forge is situated on the River Rivelin just before it reaches Malin Bridge. It dates from the 1628, pre-dating the industrial revolution and is one of the few surviving water-powered forges in the country. It was famous for producing anvils that were exported all over the world, and it closed around 1933. The works also produced vices and various other engineering tools. Part of the site is a grade two listed building although much of the old machinery is open to the elements. It was a large concern; one of the buildings has now been converted to a private house although a lot of the site is ruined. From the late 1920s to the 1950s a woodworking business, the Malin Bridge Construction Company, occupied one of the other buildings. The importance of the site is emphasised by the fact that a book has been written about the forge by Richard A. Postman.

===Burgon &amp; Ball===
Burgon &amp; Ball is an old Sheffield firm which originally made shears, scissors and knives. Its Sheffield origins date back to 1730; they moved to the La Plata Works on Holme Lane in Malin Bridge in 1873. The works were built on the site of a cutlery grinding wheel, which had existed since the 1690s, on land cleared after the 1864 flood. The works stand on the banks of the River Loxley and the river provided much of the power for the works throughout the 1900s. In the latter part of the 19th century the company patented a design for hand sheep shears and in one year sold over 300,000 pairs of shears. By 1920 the firm was producing more garden shears than sheep shears and it has continued to diversify into garden tools over the years. There is still a market for hand sheep shears and the company is now the only British manufacturer.
===St Polycarp&#x27;s Church, Malin Bridge===
Originally Malin Bridge was in the parish of Wadsley, however a separate parish was created in 1933 as the population of the area increased. A tin tabernacle had previously been used for worship as the area had no church and fundraising was commenced to build St Polycarp&#x27;s at the junction of Loxley Road and Wisewood Lane. The foundation stone for the new church was laid by the Bishop of Sheffield and it was built by H.I. Potter of Fowler, Sandford &amp; Potter in 1933–34, the former tin tabernacle remaining in use as the church hall until the 1960s when the new church hall was built adjacent to the church. The church is built of rustic brick with a pantile roof with no tower or spire; windows are grouped in threes. The interior consists of a four bay nave and a broad chancel with a tall arch. A small glazed porch was added in 1992 at the western end.

===Malin Bridge Supertram Terminus===
Malin Bridge was chosen as one of the termini of the South Yorkshire Supertram; it is the western limit of the blue line service which runs eastwards to the city centre and then on to Halfway. The terminus was first used on 23 October 1995 and is a single platform stop which is separated from the traffic on the A6101 (Holme Lane). In February 2006 work started on a Park and ride scheme adjacent to the terminus on the opposite side of Holme Lane. The unmanned scheme which cost £500,000 opened in November 2006 providing 104 parking spaces, as well as CCTV cameras and bicycle shelters. The park and ride has not been well used and price cuts have been introduced to encourage people to use the scheme.


===Schools===
There are two schools in the Malin Bridge area, Forge Valley School on Wood Lane opened in September 2011 and replaced Wisewood School &amp; Community Sports College and Myers Grove School. Malin Bridge Primary School is situated on Dykes Lane. Built by H. I. Potter, it was opened in 1905, enlarged in 1910 and has almost 500 pupils.

===Public houses===
There are now four public houses in the area. The Loxley formerly known as the Yew Tree Inn, is located at the centre of Malin Bridge. The original pub was destroyed in the 1864 flood and a new building was constructed on the same site; the original structure was used as a makeshift mortuary after the flood. The Anvil on Stannington Road owes its name to the nearby Mousehole Forge which was once one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of anvils. The present building dates from 1935 and replaced an inn of the same name whose history goes back to 1825. The Holly Bush is also in the general area, just along Rivelin Valley Road, although it is usually said to be in Rivelin Valley rather than Malin Bridge; it dates from 1841. The Malin Bridge Inn dates from 1831; it was completely destroyed in the 1864 flood when it was known as the Cleakum Inn and was rebuilt with its present name after the flood. The Stag Inn, just across the road, was never rebuilt after being turned into a ruin by the flood.

===Flood management===
The Malin Bridge area suffered badly in the floods of June 2007. As a result of this the Environment Agency started work in August 2009 to remove trees and silt from the river beds at the confluence of the Loxley and Rivelin rivers at Malin Bridge. The work will alleviate flooding problems in the future but has had the added effect of opening up the views of the area with the confluence of the two rivers now clearly in view, something that has not been seen for many years. In September 2014 Sheffield City Council announced plans to construct a dam wall upstream in the Rivelin valley at one of two possible locations to create a flood storage area. In either case the dam will be over high with a wide crest. If the scheme goes ahead, it will reduce the depth of water downstream by during heavy rain such as those that occurred in 2007 flood.

<text>The Pamunkey Indian Reservation is a Native American reservation of the Pamunkey Indian Tribe in King William, Virginia, United States. It lies along the Pamunkey River in King William County, Virginia on the Middle Peninsula. It contains approximately of land, of which is wetlands with numerous creeks. Thirty-four families reside on the reservation and many Tribal members live in nearby Richmond, Newport News, and other parts of Virginia.

==History==

It was confirmed to the Pamunkey tribe as early as 1658 by the governor, the council, and the General Assembly of Virginia. The treaty of 1677 between the king of England, acting through the governor of Virginia, and several Native American tribes including the Pamunkey is the most important existing document describing Virginia&#x27;s relationship to Indian land. The Pamunkey tribe&#x27;s early ancestors had locations as far north as the Middle Peninsula of Virginia and as far south as South Hampton Roads in Virginia. A burial mound, reported to contain the remains of Chief Powhatan, father of Matoaka (better known to historians and the public as Pocahontas), is also on this reservation, next to railroad tracks. His brother Opechancanough relocated his remains here. He is also buried here.

<doc id="794474" wikidata="Q7372418" url="?curid=794474" title="Roxbury Latin School">
<text>The Roxbury Latin School (informally known as RL) is a private, college-preparatory, all-boys day school located in West Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 1645 by Puritan missionary John Eliot, Roxbury Latin bills itself as the oldest boys&#x27; school in North America and the oldest school in continuous existence in North America.

Roxbury Latin enrolls about 300 boys from the seventh through twelfth grades. The school has an endowment of $212 million (as of June 2024). 38% of students are on financial aid and 100% of admitted students&#x27; demonstrated financial need was met in 2022. In addition, the school has a policy of charging frontline tuition that is &quot;about 65% of that of other Boston-area independent schools.&quot; Tuition for the 2024–25 academic year is $40,600.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
 Roxbury Latin was founded by residents of Roxbury, Massachusetts to teach Latin grammar to local students. John Eliot, the local minister, believed that a religious society needed to be religiously literate—i.e., well-educated. Like many of New England&#x27;s oldest schools, the school started out as a one-room schoolhouse in Dudley Square with a single teacher, John Eliot&#x27;s brother Philip. The school&#x27;s refusal to close during the American Revolution earned it the title of the oldest school in continuous existence in North America, as Boston Latin School and New York City&#x27;s Collegiate School both temporarily shut down during the war.

Roxbury Latin&#x27;s commitment to a college-preparatory education waxed and waned in its first two centuries of existence. In the 1660s it was listed as one of Harvard College&#x27;s leading feeder schools, but between 1836 and 1844 the school sent only three students to any college. The instability was largely due to the school&#x27;s financial model. Roxbury Latin was funded by neither taxes nor tuition fees, but by local families who agreed to pay an annual subscription in perpetuity (in reality, until 1789) for the school&#x27;s maintenance in exchange for free tuition. Its budget was large enough that several distinguished gentlemen taught at Roxbury Latin early in their careers, including future Supreme Court justice William Cushing and Massachusetts governor Increase Sumner. However, for the most part, the pay was so uncompetitive relative to the tax-funded schools (in some years Boston Latin paid its teachers twice as much) that most schoolmasters departed after a year or two. Roxbury Latin did not hire a second schoolmaster until 1819.

The school briefly converted to a semi-public institution from 1839 to 1860 in exchange for subsidies from the town of Roxbury, but was expelled from the public school system after it rejected too many students from the town&#x27;s public elementary schools.

=== Selective college-preparatory institution ===
Under headmaster William Coe Collar (1867–1907), the school quadrupled in size and became the now-familiar college-preparatory institution. Although Collar was a classicist—he wrote popular Latin and Greek textbooks—he expanded Roxbury Latin&#x27;s classical curriculum beyond Latin, Greek, and mathematics, adding courses in English, modern languages, and science. He also hired specialist teachers to cover these new subjects. When Collar retired in 1907, Harvard president Charles Eliot (no relation) said that &quot;[t]here is no better preparatory school in the country.&quot; Many of Collar&#x27;s students went on to found or lead their own schools, including Middlesex (Frederick Winsor &#x27;88), St. Paul&#x27;s (Samuel Drury &#x27;97), and Cate (Curtis Cate &#x27;03).

Collar financed this expansion by imposing tuition fees for the first time in Roxbury Latin&#x27;s history, starting in 1882. Although these fees were high by contemporary standards—Roxbury Latin&#x27;s $100/year tuition handily outpaced Andover and Exeter, and was raised to $150 in 1892—they did not raise enough money, as tuition was waived for students living in Roxbury, who at the time comprised 86% of the student body. Although Collar turned Roxbury Latin into an elite prep school, the school consistently lost money under his leadership. In the 1890s, Collar attempted to convert Roxbury Latin into a boarding school, which could charge higher fees, but the new boarding department was unpopular and quickly abandoned. The board of trustees (a majority of which, by law, lived or worked in Roxbury) repeatedly rejected any attempt to move the school from Roxbury or to impose tuition fees on Roxbury boys. These difficulties were still unresolved when Collar retired in 1907.

=== Country day school ===

 In the decades following Collar&#x27;s retirement, several constraints on Roxbury Latin&#x27;s growth were removed. In 1913, the school&#x27;s charter was revised to allow alumni, and not Roxbury residents, to control the board of trustees. In 1927, the Massachusetts legislature passed an act confirming that Roxbury Latin would no longer have to educate Roxbury residents for free; however, the school did not charge residents tuition until 1935, and residents did not pay full tuition until 1961.

In 1927, Roxbury Latin moved to its present location in West Roxbury. In accordance with the country day school movement, which argued that students should be educated outside the distractions and pollution of the city, Roxbury Latin&#x27;s affluent alumni had demanded that the school move from Roxbury (which was now a working-class neighborhood) to a more suburban location. Charles Eliot of Harvard (a harsh critic of the old board) also backed the move, writing in Roxbury Latin&#x27;s promotional materials that in order to maintain the school&#x27;s ability to feed students to Harvard, it was &quot;necessary to convert the School into a country day school&quot; by leaving urban Roxbury.

The new location had a noticeable effect on Roxbury Latin&#x27;s demographics. Although West Roxbury was more affluent than Roxbury, it was heavily Irish Catholic, so mid-century Roxbury Latin was notably diverse (on religious grounds) by New England prep school standards. In the 1944–45 school year, Roxbury Latin educated a roughly equal number of Protestants and Catholics. In addition, Jews were 14% of the student body. The school admitted its first black student in 1960 and its first black graduates (from its old neighborhood of Roxbury) in 1964. In lieu of the Roxbury tuition subsidy, which for school purposes included West Roxbury, the school began offering a conventional financial aid program in 1951; by 1963 roughly one-third of the student body was on scholarship. However, a proposal to admit girls was rejected in the 1970s, and Roxbury Latin remains a boys&#x27; school to this day.

On May 16, 1995, former president George H. W. Bush visited the school and addressed the student body.

In 2003, Roxbury Latin hired Kerry Brennan as its headmaster; he had previously served as headmaster of Manhattan&#x27;s Collegiate School. In 2024, Brennan was succeeded by Sam Schaffer, the head of the Upper School at St. Albans School in Washington, D.C.

The school states that its admission rate is normally around 17% and that 90% of admitted students typically choose to enroll at RL.

==Rankings==

=== College placement ===
Roxbury Latin has been recognized in several lists of schools that send their students to selective universities.
* 2002: &quot;Worth&quot; magazine ranked RL #1 in the nation for sending students to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton. Between 1998 and 2001, 21.1% of RL graduates matriculated at one of these three schools.
* 2008: PrepReview.com ranked RL #1 in the nation for sending students to the Ivy League schools, MIT, and Stanford. 45% of RL graduates matriculated at one of these ten schools.
* 2015: MainStreet ranked RL #5 in the nation for sending students to the Ivy League schools. 36% of RL graduates matriculated at one of these eight schools.
In the five-year period from 2019 to 2023, Roxbury Latin placed 84 students at Ivy League schools, nearly half of whom (38) attended Harvard College. Approximately 55 boys graduate from Roxbury Latin every year.

=== General ===
In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Roxbury Latin the fifth-best prep school in the United States.

== Academics ==

=== Curriculum ===
Roxbury Latin has a 6:1 student-teacher ratio, and the average class size is 12. The school stopped offering Advanced Placement courses in the 2024–25 school year, asserting that it offers honors and accelerated classes which &quot;provide more range and depth than AP courses.&quot; Previously, the 54 students in the Class of 2022 took 137 AP examinations by the end of their junior year, and 74% of the papers received a 4 or a 5.

=== Test scores ===
For the Class of 2024, the middle 50% SAT scores were 690-760 in English and 680-760 in math. The school states that &quot;the median standardized testing of each class consistently hovers around 1500.&quot;

For the Class of 2025, 7 out of 56 students (12.5%) were recognized as National Merit Scholarship Semifinalists based on their performances on the PSAT/NMSQT. Seven boys were recognized in either the African American or Hispanic Recognition Programs.

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
Tuition for the 2023–24 academic year is $39,250. Roxbury Latin admits boys on a need-blind basis and commits to provide financial aid that meets 100% of admitted students&#x27; demonstrated financial need. 38% of the student body is on financial aid. In the 2023–24 academic year, 87 of the 116 families (75%) receiving financial aid grants had family incomes above $150,000/year.

The school has an unusual policy of charging frontline tuition that is &quot;about 65% of that of other Boston-area independent schools.&quot; However, after financial aid is taken into consideration, other day schools may still offer competitive tuition packages once a student is admitted. Roxbury Latin and athletic rivals Belmont Hill and Nobles all claim to meet 100% of admitted students&#x27; demonstrated financial need.

However, since Roxbury Latin is the only need-blind school out of these three, a prospective student seeking financial aid may have a better chance of obtaining admission to RL. Alternatively, a student otherwise eligible for financial aid may nonetheless apply as a full-pay student at Nobles and Belmont Hill to boost their chances of admission. In that case, RL&#x27;s large discount in frontline tuition (in addition to the continuing possibility of financial aid at RL) becomes directly relevant.

=== Endowment and expenses ===
In June 2024, Roxbury Latin&#x27;s financial endowment stood at $212 million. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021–22 school year, Roxbury Latin reported total assets of $279.9 million, net assets of $248.5 million, investment holdings of $183.4 million, and cash holdings of $5.2 million. Roxbury Latin also reported $18.6 million in program service expenses and $2.8 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

==Athletics==
Roxbury Latin&#x27;s athletic teams play in the Independent School League, a group of private day and boarding schools in Greater Boston. The school offers varsity, junior varsity and lower-level teams in football, cross country, soccer (fall), basketball, ice hockey, wrestling (winter), baseball, tennis, lacrosse, and track and field (spring).

* Wrestling. Roxbury Latin&#x27;s former head coach Steve Ward is a member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. At the time of his induction, his all-time record at Roxbury Latin was 357-57-1.
* Track &amp; Field. The track team has won its division of the New England Prep School Track Association championship in nine of the last eleven years, including five in a row from 2011 to 2015. The team also won the Independent School Track Association Championship in 2012 and 2013.
* Cross Country. The cross country team won the NEPSAC Class B Cross Country championship in 2024, 2023, 2021, 2019, 2018, and 2017. The team also won the Interscholastic League Championship in 2021, 2018, and 2017 and finished second in 2023, 2018, and 2016. In 2017, the team went undefeated.

Roxbury Latin offers a school newspaper, a yearbook, an art magazine called Forum, several language clubs, a debate team, a Model United Nations group, and various community service clubs.

=== Theater ===
The theater program shows one junior play and one senior play per year, and one musical every year. The theater program offers RL students the opportunity to meet girls from neighboring schools. 

=== Music ===

<text>Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Inc., commonly referred to as Domino&#x27;s, is an American multinational pizza restaurant chain founded in 1960 and led by CEO Russell Weiner. The corporation is Delaware-domiciled and headquartered at the Domino&#x27;s Farms Office Park in Ann Arbor Township, near Ann Arbor, Michigan. As of 2018, Domino&#x27;s had approximately 15,000 stores, with 5,649 in the United States, 1,500 in India, and 1,249 in the United Kingdom. Domino&#x27;s has stores in over 83 countries and 5,701 cities worldwide.

== History ==

=== 1960s–2010s ===
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, Jim, took over the operation of DomiNick&#x27;s, an existing location of a small pizza restaurant chain that had been owned by Dominick DeVarti, at 507 Cross Street (now 301 West Cross Street) in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University. The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, after which the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store. The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but Jim did not want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, Jim traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.

By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick&#x27;s name. One day, an employee, Jim Kennedy, returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name &quot;Domino&#x27;s&quot;. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business to Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Inc. in 1965.

The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965. Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino&#x27;s experienced rapid growth. Domino&#x27;s Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967 and by 1978, the company had expanded to 200 stores. In 1975, Domino&#x27;s faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino&#x27;s Pizza. During the lawsuit, Domino&#x27;s opened fifteen new stores under the name Pizza Dispatch, while also converting other stores to the name.

In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company. A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.

==== Leaning Tower of Pizza ====

The Leaning Tower of Pizza was a proposed 30-story slanted skyscraper that would have housed Domino&#x27;s Pizza&#x27;s operations at its Domino&#x27;s Farms campus near Ann Arbor, Michigan. In the mid-1980s, Monaghan asked Taliesin Associated Architects, the inheritors of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s practice, to erect a structure based on an un-built tower that Wright designed in 1956 for Chicago called the Golden Beacon. Sometime during the planning of the tower, Monaghan and the Taliesin architects parted company, allegedly because both parties felt the project may have not served justice to the spirit of Wright&#x27;s architecture.

Mr. Monaghan then went to Gunnar Birkerts, the architect of Domino&#x27;s unusual half-mile (800 m) long headquarters office building who came up with a design for a tower that would rise at a 15-degree angle with a swooping top reminiscent of the forms of Wright&#x27;s late work. Birkerts&#x27; design, no doubt, had serious intent, but would immediately and forever be dubbed with the nickname &quot;The Leaning Tower of Pizza&quot; after Italy&#x27;s Leaning Tower of Pisa. The structure was never built but a tall scale model stands at the proposed site on Domino Pizza headquarters in Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan, outside of Ann Arbor.

=== International expansion ===

On May 12, 1983, Domino&#x27;s opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. That same year, Domino&#x27;s opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver, Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton. Also, in 1985 Domino&#x27;s opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez. By 1995, Domino&#x27;s had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino&#x27;s opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents. By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza&#x27;s birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan, with their first Italian location. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there. After having faced tough competition from local restaurants and falling behind on its debt obligations, Domino&#x27;s exited the country in 2022.

In 1995, Domino&#x27;s Pizza entered China through the Pizza Vest Fast Food Group, which also owned the rights to operate Domino&#x27;s Pizza in eleven Southeast Asian countries.

In February 2016, Domino&#x27;s opened its 1,000th store in India. Outside the United States, India has the largest number of Domino&#x27;s outlets in the world.

==== China ====
The Chinese subsidiary is known as Domino&#x27;s Pizza China ().

As of October 2019, Domino&#x27;s Pizza China has about 250 stores in nine cities: Beijing (about 75 stores), Shanghai (about 100 stores), Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Hangzhou. The 200th store in Shenzhen, was also the 10,000th Domino&#x27;s store internationally.

The first mainland China store was located in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone 4 and the first Beijing location opened in Haidian District in May 1997. In December 2006, Taiwan&#x27;s Jinghua Hotel Group invested NT$500 million to acquire the rights for Domino&#x27;s Pizza in Taiwan and Beijing. In 2017, Dash Brands Ltd., a foreign investment company specializing in restaurant chains, obtained the exclusive rights for Hong Kong and Macau.

In China over 90% of orders are placed online. Orders can be made in the stores and on the company website, via app, and through the messaging app WeChat. Despite insisting that its own distribution system has greater advantages in safeguarding service quality and data retention, Domino&#x27;s has already opened up a model of cooperation with third-party take-out platforms such as Ele.me and Meituan.

Domino&#x27;s Pizza China has offered American-style potato bacon pizza, crayfish crispy-and-tender chicken pizza, durian pulp pizza, and salted egg-yolk pizza, as well as Sichuan pepper-flavor tender chicken drumsticks.

===2000s - present ===
In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino&#x27;s began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &quot;DPZ&quot;. Industry trade publication &quot;Pizza Today&quot; magazine named Domino&#x27;s Pizza &quot;Chain of the Year&quot; in 2003, 2010, and 2011. In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino&#x27;s opened its 5,000th American store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama, making 8,000 total stores for the system. In August 2006, the Domino&#x27;s location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino&#x27;s history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year. , Domino&#x27;s has 8,200-plus stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.

In August 2012, Domino&#x27;s Pizza changed their name to simply Domino&#x27;s (the parent company is still called Domino&#x27;s Pizza). At the same time, Domino&#x27;s introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot. This was done because the company wanted to &quot;expand&quot; menu choices rather than simply rely on their traditional pizza.

In April 2022, Domino&#x27;s Italy franchise operator EPizza SpA filed for bankruptcy at a Milan court after two years of declining sales caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns in Italy. In addition, Domino&#x27;s Pizza faced competition from local pizza chains and restaurants, which had begun using food delivery app services such as Glovo, Just Eat and Deliveroo. The reason for the failure, however, is mainly due to the fact that the customer rating of Domino&#x27;s outlets is very low in Italy, which explains the difficulty of competing with the high quality of Italian pizzas. After the 90-day grace period expired in July 2022, Domino&#x27;s closed all its Italian stores on 20 July.

On December 12, 2024, Domino&#x27;s announced that it would transfer its stock to the Nasdaq Global Select Market which took effect on January 2, 2025 at the stock market open. The company retained the ticker symbol &quot;DPZ&quot;.

Domino&#x27;s has announced on February 7, 2025, that it plans to close over 200 stores worldwide, 172 of them just in Japan, where Domino&#x27;s Pizza Japan operates 1000 stores. The decision comes after CEO and Managing Director Mark van Dyck took the reigns of the company. The reason given for the closures, is low sales in the selected stores. Of all the markets that include the brand, Australia - New Zealand was the only market to report positive growth. With the closures, Domino&#x27;s expects to reduce costs by approximately 9.8 million dollars.

== Products ==

The Domino&#x27;s menu varies by region. The current Domino&#x27;s menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American main and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino&#x27;s launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken and bread side dishes, as well as beverages and desserts.

From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino&#x27;s Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery. Historically, Domino&#x27;s menu consisted solely of one style of pizza crust in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), eleven toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.
The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino&#x27;s deep dish. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms. Domino&#x27;s started testing extra-large-size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long &quot;The Dominator&quot;.

Domino&#x27;s tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy &quot;Buffalo Chicken Kickers&quot;, as an alternative to Buffalo wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to &quot;heat up&quot; and &quot;cool down&quot; the chicken.

In August 2003, Domino&#x27;s announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the &quot;Philly Cheese Steak Pizza&quot;. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen&#x27;s Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising. Domino&#x27;s continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its &quot;Brooklyn Style Pizza&quot;, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.

In 2008, Domino&#x27;s once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway&#x27;s toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named &quot;Jared&quot;, a reference to Subway&#x27;s spokesman of the same name.

The company introduced its &quot;American Legends&quot; line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company&#x27;s regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings. That same year, Domino&#x27;s began selling its &quot;BreadBowl Pasta&quot; entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the &quot;Lava Crunch Cake&quot; dessert, a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge. Domino&#x27;s promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.

In 2010, shortly after the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Domino&#x27;s changed its pizza recipe &quot;from the crust up&quot;, making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas. Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino&#x27;s product due to taste issues.

In September 2012, Domino&#x27;s announced it was introducing pan pizza to the menu on September 24, 2012, and the original Deep Dish pizza introduced 23 years prior was discontinued in favor of the new pan pizza.

In December 2013, Domino&#x27;s Pizza in Israel unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute supplied by the UK company VBites.

== Franchises ==
Domino&#x27;s Pizza, as of September 2018, has locations in the United States (including the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands), in 83 other countries, including overseas territories such as the Cayman Islands, and states with limited recognition, such as Kosovo and Northern Cyprus. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in America) In 2016, Domino&#x27;s opened its 1,000th store in India. As of the first quarter of 2018, Domino&#x27;s had approximately 15,000 stores, with 5,649 in the United States, 1,232 in India, and 1,094 in the United Kingdom.

In most cases, Domino&#x27;s has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:
* Domino&#x27;s Pizza Israel was founded in 1990, and opened their first branch in 1993. They are operated by Elgad Pizza. As of August 2014, there are 33 branches throughout the state. There are four kosher franchises.
* The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Monaco, Luxembourg, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Cambodia are currently owned by Australian Domino&#x27;s Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises). The Australian company also acquired several European and Asian franchises between 2013 and 2022. It acquired the Danish operations in 2019 but liquidated them in 2023.
* The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino&#x27;s Pizza Group (DPG), which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011, and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. DPG opened its first Swedish location near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016; three years later, in 2019, they announced that they would be selling all of their current businesses in the country.
* In Latin America, the first franchise was opened in 1988 in Colombia. During the next years, Domino&#x27;s Pizza started operations in Mexico, Guatemala (1989), Chile (1991), Venezuela (1992), Dominican Republic (1993), Ecuador and Peru (1995). However, due to problems in administration and after several cases of unhealthiness, the Domino&#x27;s Peruvian franchise closed in 2015, and reopened one year later with new owners.
* The master franchises for India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks.

=== Sales ===
There are currently 6,157 total Domino&#x27;s units in the US, and of those 5,815 of those are franchised units. In 2018, the Average Weekly Unit Sales (AWUS) for franchised units was $22,045, showing a consistent increase over the past five years. Per year, this amounts to an average of over a million dollars in sales. Domino&#x27;s EBITDA was 15.0% for stores making more than $25,000. The vast majority of stores fell under this category, over 1,500 units. According to Domino&#x27;s 2019 income statement, their net income was just over $400,000. The initial franchise fee for a Domino&#x27;s franchise is $10,000, the royalty fee is 5.5% of the store&#x27;s weekly sales, and the advertising payment is 4% of the store&#x27;s weekly sales.

== Advertising ==

In late 1986, Domino&#x27;s was well known for its advertisements featuring a slapstick character called the Noid, created by Group 243 Inc. who hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that featured the character. The character was designed to be the personification of any and all possible unsatisfactory experiences when having pizza delivered; as such, the catchphrase associated with the commercials was &quot;Avoid the Noid&quot;. The ad campaign gained notoriety, however, in 1989, when a man named Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino&#x27;s employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia. The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered. Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide in 1995. Contrary to popular belief, Domino&#x27;s has stated that the retirement of the Noid ad campaign was not a result of the hostage situation. The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino&#x27;s Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.

Due to a glitch on the Domino&#x27;s website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but scrapped the idea and never promoted it. The redemption code to receive the pizzas was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word &quot;bailout&quot; as the redemption code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino&#x27;s deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.

Domino&#x27;s sponsored CART&#x27;s Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino&#x27;s teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the &quot;Official Pizza of NASCAR&quot;. Domino&#x27;s also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.

In June 2018, Domino&#x27;s announced that it had started a project to pave over cracks and potholes on roads in the United States called &quot;Paving for Pizza&quot; to prevent their pizzas from being ruined, giving cities and towns grants for road repairs. The company had reached an agreement with four cities and towns, including Burbank, California; Bartonville, Texas; Athens, Georgia; and Milford, Delaware, to pave their roads. The paved sections feature the Domino&#x27;s logo along with the slogan &quot;OH YES, WE DID&quot;.

=== 30-minute guarantee ===
Beginning in 1973, Domino&#x27;s Pizza offered a guarantee to customers their pizza would be delivered within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizza free. This guarantee was changed to $3 off in 1987. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a speeding Domino&#x27;s delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another lawsuit in 1993, a woman who was injured when a Domino&#x27;s delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle was awarded nearly $80 million by a jury, but accepted a payout of $15 million. The half-hour guarantee was dropped that year because of the &quot;public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility&quot;, according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.

In December 2007, Domino&#x27;s introduced a new slogan, &quot;You Got 30 Minutes&quot;, alluding to the earlier pledge, but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.

The company continues to honor the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores located in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and India. The 30-minute guarantee is subject to the terms and conditions applied in the respective country.

== Marketing ==
In 2001, Domino&#x27;s launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington, D.C., provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross&#x27; disaster relief effort. In 2004, Domino&#x27;s began a partnership with St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, participating in the hospital&#x27;s &quot;Thanks and Giving&quot; campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.

In 2007, Domino&#x27;s introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites. In 2008, Domino&#x27;s introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar. Since 2005, the voice of Domino&#x27;s Pizza&#x27;s US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.

In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino&#x27;s was last—tied with Chuck E. Cheese. In December that year, Domino&#x27;s announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza&#x27;s quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza. The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain.

In 2011, Domino&#x27;s launched a billboard advertising in New York&#x27;s Times Square which displayed real time comments from customers, including good, neutral and bad comments.

In 2015, Domino&#x27;s unveiled a &quot;pizza car&quot; that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, two-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces. It also has a oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the Domino&#x27;s DXP, the car is a Chevrolet Spark customized by Roush Performance. Once each car reaches 100,000 miles, it will be retired and returned to Roush, where it will be returned to stock form.

In 2016, Domino&#x27;s cooperated with Starship Technologies and applied self-driving robots to deliver pizzas in specific German and Dutch cities. In 2016, Domino&#x27;s in New Zealand delivered the world&#x27;s first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.

In February 2017, Domino&#x27;s launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino&#x27;s cards. Domino&#x27;s also worked with Gugu Guru to create a pizza-themed baby registry. Customers have the option of signing up for Domino&#x27;s pizza package to be served for the event.

In June 2018, Domino&#x27;s began repairing potholes in America as part of its &quot;Paving for Pizza&quot; initiative to prevent its pizzas from being damaged in transit.

In June 2019, Domino&#x27;s announced a partnership with robotics company Nuro. The service is slated to launch in Houston, Texas, with Nuro&#x27;s custom, self-driving vehicle, R2.

In December 2021, the company began offering &quot;surprise frees,&quot; or complimentary items as part of a delivery process, of up to $50 million. The move was made to distinguish the company from delivery apps that charged fees.

In January 2022, the company announced it would cut back on promotional offers as well as adjust specific menu items in response to inflationary pressures.

In September 2022, the company launched an &quot;Inflation Relief Deal&quot; that for a limited time offered a 20% discount on online ordering.

In November 2022, Domino&#x27;s added 800 Chevy Bolt cars to the United States fleet of cars.

<text>Archie Mason Griffin (born August 21, 1954) is an American former football running back who played with the Cincinnati Bengals in the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons. He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, and is the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner in NCAA history, 1974–1975, considered one of the greatest college football players of all time. Griffin won four Big Ten Conference titles with the Buckeyes and was the first player to ever start in four Rose Bowls. He was selected in the first round by the Bengals in the 1976 NFL draft.

==Early life==
Griffin rushed for 1,787 yards and scored over 170 points in 11 games, including 29 touchdowns, as a senior fullback at Eastmoor High School (now Eastmoor Academy) in Columbus, Ohio. That year, he led Eastmoor to the Columbus City League championship, rushing for 267 yards on 31 carries in the title game against Linden-McKinley High School. In his junior year, Griffin also rushed for over 1,000 yards.

In 1996, Griffin was inducted into the High School Hall of Fame, with Eastmoor Academy renaming their playing field &quot;Archie Griffin Field&quot; in his honor.

==College career==
Griffin played for the Ohio State University Buckeyes from 1972 to 1975. When he won a starting position his freshman year, many sophomores were disappointed because Griffin took their spot. Former Ohio State head coach Woody Hayes said of Griffin, &quot;He&#x27;s a better young man than he is a football player, and he&#x27;s the best football player I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

In 1972, Griffin was a T-formation halfback, and from 1973 through 1975, he was the team&#x27;s I-formation tailback. He led the Buckeyes in rushing as a freshman with 867 yards, but his numbers exploded the following year with the team&#x27;s conversion to the I-formation. He rushed for 1,428 yards in the regular season as a sophomore, 1,620 as a junior, 1,357 as a senior. Griffin was the only back to lead the Big Ten Conference in rushing for three straight years until Jonathan Taylor did so from 2017 to 2019. Overall, Griffin rushed for 5,589 yards on 924 carries in his four seasons with the Buckeyes (1972–1975), then an NCAA record. He had 6,559 all-purpose yards and scored 26 touchdowns. In their four seasons with Griffin as their starting running back, the Buckeyes posted a record of 40–5–1. Griffin is one of only two players in collegiate football history to start four Rose Bowl games, the other being Brian Cushing.

Griffin introduced himself to OSU fans as a freshman by setting a school single-game rushing record of 239 yards in the second game of the 1972 season, against North Carolina, breaking a team record that had stood for 27 seasons. His only carry in his first game had resulted in a fumble. He broke his own record as a sophomore with 246 rushing yards in a game against the Iowa Hawkeyes. Over his four-year collegiate career, Griffin rushed for at least 100 yards in 34 games, including an NCAA record 31 consecutive games.

===College statistics===
===Honors===
Griffin finished fifth in the Heisman vote in his sophomore year and won the award as a junior and senior. He is the only NCAA football player to date to win the award twice. In addition to his two Heisman Trophies, Griffin won many other college awards. He is one of four players to win the Big Ten Most Valuable Player twice (1973–1974). United Press International named him Player of the Year twice (1974–1975), Walter Camp Foundation named him player of the year twice (1974–1975), he won the Maxwell Award (1975), and The Sporting News named him Man of the Year (1975).
The College Football Hall of Fame enshrined Griffin in 1986. Ohio State enshrined him in their own Ohio State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1981 and officially retired his number, 45, in 1999. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1990. On January 1, 2014, Griffin was named the 1970s player of the decade in the Rose Bowl All-Century Class during the celebration of the 100th Rose Bowl Game (2014).

In 2013, Griffin was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. In 2020, he was ranked No. 4 on ESPN&#x27;s list of the Top 150 players in college football history.

On August 17, 2024, Griffin was honored with a statue and a legacy walk in the Rose Bowl. On August 30, 2024, Griffin was honored with a statue outside 
Ohio Stadium.

==Professional career==
In the 1976 NFL draft, Griffin was selected in the first round, 24th overall, by the Cincinnati Bengals. He played all seven seasons in the NFL with the Bengals, from 1976 to 1982. He was joined in the backfield by his college fullback teammate Pete Johnson, drafted by the Bengals in 1977, and his brother and Ohio State defensive back Ray Griffin, drafted in 1978. Griffin rushed for 2808 career yards and 7 touchdowns, and caught 192 passes for 1607 yards and 6 touchdowns. He played in Super Bowl XVI with the Bengals in 1982. He finished the game with one carry for four yards, and muffed a kick return in the 26–21 loss.

Following the end of his Bengals career, Griffin played very briefly with the Jacksonville Bulls of the United States Football League (USFL). He played in one game and had ten carries for 11 yards.

==Post-football career==

Griffin is the former president and CEO of the Ohio State University Alumni Association. He is also the current spokesman for the Wendy&#x27;s High School Heisman award program. Formerly, he served as assistant athletic director for the university and speaks to the football team before every game. He meets fans in the alumni suite, including opposing fans.

Griffin also serves on the board of directors for Motorists Insurance, which has offices in downtown Columbus, Abercrombie and Fitch, and the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame, based in Irving, Texas.

Along with former National Basketball Association basketball player Magic Johnson, Griffin was one of the investors in Mandalay Baseball Properties LLC, which owned the Dayton Dragons, a single-A Minor League affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, prior to the sale of the team in 2014 to Palisades Arcadia Baseball LLC.

On August 31, 2024, Griffin dotted the &quot;i&quot; during Ohio State&#x27;s home opener.

==Family==
Griffin is a son of Margaret and James Griffin. He has six brothers and a sister. His brothers include Raymond, a former NFL cornerback and a teammate with the Bengals, and Keith who also played in the NFL.

In 2024, Griffin&#x27;s son Andre became the head football coach at Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin School and was previously an assistant football coach at Ohio Northern University. Another son, Adam, played as a defensive back for Ohio State for three seasons until a shoulder injury ended his playing career. Griffin also has three grandsons.

<text>Horton Guyford Stever (October 24, 1916 – April 9, 2010) was an American administrator, physicist, educator, and engineer. He was a director of the National Science Foundation (from February 1972 to August 1976).

==Biography==
Stever was raised in Corning, New York, principally by his maternal grandmother. He played football in high school. He graduated from Colgate University with an undergraduate degree in physics and then from California Institute of Technology in 1941 with a PhD in physics. He joined the staff of the radiation lab at MIT. In 1942 he began serving the military as a civilian scientific liaison officer based in London, England until the end of World War II. After D-Day he was sent to France several times to study German technology.

He returned to MIT after the war, serving as associate dean of engineering there from 1956 to 1959 and then as a department head. In 1965 he became the fifth President of Carnegie Mellon University (and the first under that name, in 1967), a position he held until 1972. Stever House, a dorm on Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s campus is named for him. During this period, he was also chairman of the aeronautics and space engineering board for the National Academy of Engineering advising NASA and other Federal agencies.

He also served as the director of the National Science Foundation from 1972 until 1976. Between 1976 and 1977 he was President Gerald Ford&#x27;s Science Advisor.

He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1982 to 2006.

Stever received an LL.D. from Bates College in 1977. In 1997, he received the Vannevar Bush Award from the National Science Board.

Stever died at his home in Gaithersburg, Maryland on April 9, 2010.

===NACA Special Committee on Space Technology===
Guyford Stever was chairman or member of numerous advisory committees to the U.S. government. The NACA&#x27;s &quot;Special Committee on Space Technology,&quot; also called the &quot;Stever Committee,&quot; was among the better-known of these. It was a special steering committee that was formed with the mandate to coordinate various branches of the Federal government, private companies as well as universities within the United States with NACA&#x27;s objectives and also harness their expertise in order to develop a space program. 
Remarkably, Hendrik Wade Bode, the man who helped develop the robot weapons that brought down the Nazi V-1 flying bombs over London during WWII, was actually serving on the same committee and sitting at the same table as the chief engineer of the V-2, the other weapon that terrorised London: Wernher von Braun.
As of their meeting on May 26, 1958, committee members, starting clockwise from the left of the adjacent picture, included:
=== NRC Committee on Human Exploration of Space ===
In 1990 Stever chaired a &quot;Committee on Human Exploration of Space&quot; for the National Research Council. The committee released a report titled, &quot;Human Exploration of Space: A Review of NASA&#x27;s 90-Day Study and Alternatives.&quot;

<doc id="794492" wikidata="Q3229338" url="?curid=794492" title="Fitting lemma">
<text>In mathematics, the Fitting lemma – named after the mathematician Hans Fitting – is a basic statement in abstract algebra. Suppose &quot;M&quot; is a module over some ring. If &quot;M&quot; is indecomposable and has finite length, then every endomorphism of &quot;M&quot; is either an automorphism or nilpotent.

As an immediate consequence, we see that the endomorphism ring of every finite-length indecomposable module is local.

A version of Fitting&#x27;s lemma is often used in the representation theory of groups. This is in fact a special case of the version above, since every &quot;K&quot;-linear representation of a group &quot;G&quot; can be viewed as a module over the group algebra &quot;KG&quot;.

== Proof ==

To prove Fitting&#x27;s lemma, we take an endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of &quot;M&quot; and consider the following two chains of submodules:

* The first is the descending chain formula_1,
* the second is the ascending chain formula_2
Because formula_3 has finite length, both of these chains must eventually stabilize, so there is some formula_4 with formula_5 for all formula_6, and some formula_7 with formula_8 for all formula_9

Let now formula_10, and note that by construction formula_11 and formula_12

We claim that formula_13. Indeed, every formula_14 satisfies formula_15 for some formula_16 but also formula_17, so that formula_18, therefore formula_19 and thus formula_20

Moreover, formula_21: for every formula_22, there exists some formula_16 such that formula_24 (since formula_25), and thus formula_26, so that formula_27 and thus formula_28

Consequently, formula_3 is the direct sum of formula_30 and formula_31. (This statement is also known as the &quot;Fitting decomposition theorem&quot;.) Because formula_3 is indecomposable, one of those two summands must be equal to formula_3 and the other must be the zero submodule. Depending on which of the two summands is zero, we find that formula_34 is either bijective or nilpotent.

<doc id="794498" wikidata="Q4165342" url="?curid=794498" title="Muhsin ibn Ali">
<text>Muhsin ibn Ali (), also spelled Mohsin, was the youngest son of Fatima bint Muhammad and Ali ibn Abi Talib, and thus a maternal grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was a brother of Husayn and Hasan. Controversy surrounds the fate of Muhsin as some canonical Shia sources report that Muhsin died in miscarriage, following a raid on her house led by Umar, a companion of Muhammad. Alternatively, Sunnis hold that Muhsin died in infancy of natural causes.

== Name ==

The name Muhsin, like those of his brothers Hasan and Husayn, comes from the Arabic root Ḥ-S-N. Muhsin can mean &#x27;beneficent,&#x27; &#x27;benefactor,&#x27; or &#x27;one who does the act of helping.&#x27; 

== Historical background ==
=== Saqifa ===
In the immediate aftermath of Muhammad&#x27;s death in 11/632, the Ansar (natives of Medina) gathered in the Saqifa () of the Sa&#x27;ida clan. The conventional wisdom is that they met to decide on a new leader for the Muslim community among themselves. For Madelung, however, the absence of the Muhajirun (migrants from Mecca) from this meeting suggests that the Ansar gathered to re-establish the control of the Ansar over their city Medina, under the belief that the Muhajirun would mostly return to Mecca after Muhammad&#x27;s death.

Abu Bakr and Umar, both companions of Muhammad, hastened to the gathering upon learning about it. After a heated session, in which a chief of the Ansar was likely beaten into submission by Umar, those gathered at Saqifa agreed on Abu Bakr as the new head of the community.

=== Opposition to Saqifa ===
The Saqifa event is said to have excluded Muhammad&#x27;s family, who were preparing to bury him, and most of the Muhajirun. To protest the appointment of Abu Bakr, al-Baladhuri () reports that the Banu Hashim (Muhammad&#x27;s clan) and some of his companions gathered at Fatima&#x27;s house. Among them were Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas and his companion Zubayr, according to Madelung. The protesters, including Fatima, held that her husband Ali was the rightful successor to Muhammad, possibly referring to Muhammad&#x27;s announcement at Ghadir Khumm. Ali is believed to have explained this position to Abu Bakr.

=== Threats against Ali ===
After the Saqifa affair, Abu Bakr reportedly tasked his ally Umar with securing Ali&#x27;s pledge of allegiance. As noted by the Sunni al-Tabari (),&#x27; the latter led an armed mob to Ali&#x27;s residence and threatened to set the house on fire if Ali and his supporters would not pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr.&#x27; The scene soon grew violent, and Zubayr was disarmed and carried away. The mob, however, retreated without Ali&#x27;s pledge after Fatima pleaded with them, as reported in &quot;al-Imama wa al-siyasa.&quot; Alternatively, al-Baladhuri states that Ali capitulated and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr immediately after Umar&#x27;s threat. In contrast, the canonical &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; and &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; relate that Ali pledged to Abu Bakr after Fatima died. 

=== Attack on Fatima&#x27;s house ===
It is uncertain what followed the above altercation at Fatima&#x27;s house. Some Shia sources report that Fatima suffered injuries during a raid on her house led by Umar, including the canonical &quot;Kitab al-Kafi.&quot; 

The allegations of violence are categorically rejected by Sunnis, though such claims appear in some Sunni historical sources: In his &quot;al-Saqifa wa Fadak&quot;, al-Jawhari () includes a tradition to the effect that Umar and his men first threatened to set Fatima&#x27;s house on fire. Then they entered the house, despite her pleas, and forced Ali and his supporters out of the house. The remainder of the account in &quot;al-Imama wa al-siyasa&quot; describes that Ali was pulled out of his house by force and threatened with death, according to Khetia.&quot;&quot; Mu&#x27;awiya () is known to have alluded to the violent arrest of Ali in a letter to him before the Battle of Siffin. Al-Tabari notes that Abu Bakr regretted the events after Saqifa on his deathbed, writing that Abu Bakr wished he had &quot;never opened Fatima&#x27;s house to anything, even though they had locked it as a gesture of defiance.&quot; 

==== Modern views ====
Madelung is uncertain about the use of force. Still, he notes that there is evidence (in Sunni sources) that Fatima&#x27;s house was searched. According to Madelung, Ali later repeatedly said that he would have resisted (Abu Bakr) had there been forty men with him. Alternatively, Buehler suggests that the allegations of violence should be treated with caution as they reflect the political agendas of the time. In contrast, Veccia Vaglieri is of the view that the Shia allegations are based on facts, even if they have been exaggerated. Abbas writes that some well-regarded Sunni sources mention Umar&#x27;s raid and Fatima&#x27;s injuries.
== Sunni view ==

Some Sunni authors record a fifth child of Fatima, named Muhsin. These include al-Baladhuri who maintains that Muhsin died in infancy. Al-Mas&#x27;udi and al-Ya&#x27;qubi also list Muhsin among the children of Fatima without alluding to miscarriage, though they have both been accused of Shia tendencies. 

== Shia view ==
Some Shia sources report that Fatima suffered injuries during a raid on her house led by Umar, including the canonical &quot;Kitab al-Kafi.&quot; Many of these sources also allege that Fatima miscarried in this raid her son Muhsin, whose name had been chosen by Muhammad before his death, according to Abbas. 

=== &quot;Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays&quot; ===

==== Authenticity of the book ====
Perhaps the earliest and most detailed Shia account of Umar&#x27;s raid appears in the &quot;Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays&quot; (). The attribution of this collection of Shia hadiths to Sulaym, who might have been a close companion of Ali, is often rejected by Sunnis. On the other hand, when asked about it, the fifth Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir (), is said to have confirmed the authenticity of the book. Nevertheless, there is no consensus among Shia theologians about the reliability of the whole book. After analyzing the text, Modarresi is of the view that the core of the text has been preserved and dates back to before 138 AH, while some parts of the book might be more recent, such as its prediction of black banners arriving from the East before the collapse of the Umayyads. At the same time, such instances of anachronism have been viewed by the Shia as prophesies on the part of the prophet and the Shia Imams, notes Khetia.

==== Attack ====
Much of the post-Saqifa account in the &quot;Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays&quot; is similar to (Sunni) historical sources, but the book also contains explicit details of an alleged raid led by an impatient Umar on Fatima&#x27;s house after multiple failed attempts to subdue Ali. The account is narrated on the authority of Salman (), a close companion of both the prophet and Ali. In the final standoff, according to this account, Fatima refused the mob entry into the house, after which an enraged Umar ignored Fatima&#x27;s pleas and set the door on fire, pushing his way into the house. Upon Fatima&#x27;s resistance, the account describes that Umar physically assaulted her with a sheathed sword. The mob soon overpowered Ali and dragged him away, striking Fatima again as she tried to prevent it. The account states that Fatima still carried the bruises from this raid when she died soon after. A slightly different version of the book also contains a reference to Fatima&#x27;s miscarriage, according to Soufi.

=== &quot;Kamil al-ziyarat&quot; ===
&quot;Kamil al-ziyarat&quot; was compiled by al-Qummi (), a distinguished Twelver traditionist. The book includes a hadith ascribed to the sixth Imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (), in which the prophet was informed during the Isra about the violent deaths of his family at the hands of Muslims. For his daughter Fatima, the report mentions her miscarriage and death because of her injuries during a raid on her house. This tradition is reported on the authority of Hammad ibn Uthman, a well-known companion of al-Sadiq and a mainstream Shia. As a result, this tradition is again viewed as authentic in Twelver hadith circles.

According to Khetia, this book contains the earliest reference to Fatima&#x27;s miscarriage during Umar&#x27;s raid. Alternatively, Soufi notes that a slightly different version of the &quot;Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays&quot; already refers to Fatima&#x27;s miscarriage during the alleged attack. 

=== &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; ===
This work was compiled by al-Mufid (), another prominent Twelver theologian. Therein, al-Mufid only mentions the Shia belief in the miscarriage of Muhsin without referring to Umar or listing any traditions to support this belief. Considering that al-Mufid writes about violence against Fatima elsewhere, Khetia suspects that he refrained in his &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; from controversial topics to render the book accessible to most Twelvers without provoking the anger of Sunnis.

=== &quot;Dala&#x27;il al-imama&quot; ===
In his &quot;Dala&#x27;il al-imama&quot;, Ibn Rustam (4/11 century) includes a tradition from Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq on the authority of Abu Basir, a prolific transmitter of hadith and a close companion of the sixth Imam. The rest of the chain of transmission includes some of the most prominent Shia authorities, and this hadith is thus viewed as reliable. The content of the hadith is very similar to the account found in the &quot;Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays&quot;, except that it adds that Fatima lost Muhsin when she was struck by a client of Umar, named Qunfudh, rather than Umar himself.

== Death of Fatima ==
Fatima died in 11/632, within six months of Muhammad&#x27;s death. She was about eighteen or twenty-seven at that time according to Shia and Sunni sources, respectively. The Sunni view is that Fatima died from grief after Muhammad&#x27;s death. Shia Islam, however, holds that Fatima&#x27;s injuries during the raid by Umar directly caused her miscarriage and death shortly after.

Some sources report that Fatima never reconciled with Abu Bakr and Umar, partly based on a tradition to this effect in the canonical Sunni collection &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;. There are also some accounts that Abu Bakr and Umar visited Fatima on her deathbed to apologize, which Madelung considers self-incriminatory. As reported in &quot;al-Imama wa al-siyasa&quot;, Fatima reminded the two visitors of Muhammad&#x27;s words, &quot;Fatima is part of me, and whoever angers her has angered me.&quot; The dying Fatima then told the two that they had indeed angered her and that she would soon take her complaint to God and His prophet, Muhammad. There are also Sunni reports that Fatima reconciled with Abu Bakr and Umar, though Madelung suggests that they were invented to address the negative implications of Fatima&#x27;s anger.

Following her will, Ali buried Fatima secretly at night. As noted by al-Tabari, her dying wish was that Abu Bakr should not attend the funeral, and this request was fulfilled by Ali. Her exact burial place in Medina remains uncertain.

=== Shia Commemoration ===
Muhsin ibn Ali is mourned by Twelver Shia Muslims as a martyr, a &quot;prototype of all holy innocents in Islam,&quot; in the words of Massignon. He also draws a parallel between Muhsin and the infants killed at the order of King Herod in the Gospel accounts of the birth of Jesus.

<text>Sandra Lee &quot;Sandy&quot; Scheuer (; August 11, 1949 – May 4, 1970) was a student at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, when she was killed by Ohio National Guardsmen in the Kent State shootings.

==Background==

Scheuer was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the daughter of Sarah (Lacko) and Martin Scheuer. She had an older sister, Audrey. She was Jewish. She was an honors student in speech therapy, and was a graduate of Boardman High School.

==May 4, 1970==
Scheuer did not take part in the Vietnam War protests that preceded the shootings. She was shot once in the neck with an M-1 rifle from a distance of 130 yards (119 m) while walking between classes. The bullet severed her jugular vein and she died within five or six minutes from loss of blood. According to the account of her boyfriend Bruce Burkland, Scheuer &quot;was walking with one of her speech and hearing therapy students across the green. Caught in the gunfire, neither Sandra nor the young man had anything to do with the assembly of students on the green.&quot; Three other unarmed students were also killed in the shootings: Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, and William Knox Schroeder.

The shootings led to protests and a national student strike, causing hundreds of campuses to close because of both violent and non-violent demonstrations. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks. Five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., against the war.

Scheuer had been a member of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, and current members of this sorority speak in her memory each year on the Kent State University campus at the May 4 Task Force&#x27;s commemoration of the 1970 tragedy.

In 2018 an exhibit in memory of Scheuer called &quot;Sandy&#x27;s Scrapbook&quot;, based on an actual scrapbook she kept while attending Kent State, opened at the University&#x27;s May 4 Visitor Center.

==In popular culture==
Just after Scheuer&#x27;s death, the songwriter Harvey Andrews composed a song titled &quot;Hey Sandy&quot;, whose lyrics are addressed to her:

In the song &quot;Ohio&quot;, which was written immediately after the shootings, folk rocker Neil Young made a reference to Scheuer in the chorus:

Scheuer is also remembered in poet Gary Geddes&#x27; poem &quot;Sandra Lee Scheuer&quot;, found in his 1980 collection &quot;The Acid Test&quot;. An image of a memorial to Scheuer was included in the CD case to &quot;The Argument&quot; (2001) by Fugazi.

<text>The Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC) (Ojibwe: Gnoozhekaaning, lit. &quot;Place of the Pike&quot;), is an Indian reservation forming the land base of one of the many federally recognized Sault Ste. Marie bands of Ojibwe.

The largest section of the reservation is located in Chippewa County, Michigan, approximately 15 miles (25 km) west-southwest of Sault Ste. Marie. The tribe has land in both Bay Mills and Superior townships. A smaller section lies southeast of Sault Ste. Marie and encompasses Sugar Island, all contained within the boundaries of Sugar Island Township.

==History==
The Ojibwe are a large tribe with numerous bands who have occupied territory for centuries around the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Their territories are now divided between the nations of Canada and the United States.

Numerous bands have historically occupied areas around the cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Ontario. The city developed along both sides of the St. Mary&#x27;s River, established first during the colonial era as a French and then British fur trading post. A settled community gradually developed around the post, cosmopolitan in its varied cultures of Native American tribes, Métis people, and French and Anglo ethnic Europeans. In the 19th century, the Ojibwe bands in Michigan were forced to cede large amounts of territory to the United States, and many bands became landless. Nonetheless, they persisted in maintaining their cultural communities.

Bay Mills people are Ojibwe who have lived for hundreds of years around the Whitefish Bay, the falls of the St. Marys River, and the bluffs overlooking Tahquamenon Bay, all on Lake Superior and southwest of Sault Ste. Marie. The Bay Mills Indian Community was officially established by an Act of Congress on June 19, 1860.

After passage of the federal Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934, during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC) created a new form of government under a written constitution, adopted on November 27, 1937. This was approved and recognized by the federal government, which purchased land for the community to establish a reservation land base. Its territory was one of the four reservations established in Michigan under the 1934 act. These lands, along with the original Bay Mills Mission and a small area on Sugar Island, occupied by its people at least since the late 18th century, comprise the majority of the current reservation land holdings in Chippewa County.

In 1966, BMIC was one of the four founding members of the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, established to share developments and to improve relations of tribes with the state and federal governments. Other founding members were the Keweenaw Potawatomie Indian Community, Hannahville Indian Community, and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe. The council now represents 11 of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan.

In May 2021, the Kateri Tekakwitha church in Bay Mills, Michigan, was destroyed by a fire. It was the second time that the same church had been burned, which had been built in her honor.

==Reservation==
The area within the reservation boundaries is in U.S. trust status and is divided into two separate areas. As of the 2000 census, the majority of the land base, , lies northwest of Brimley, Michigan, in the eastern parts of Bay Mills and Superior townships. The remaining 1.032 square miles (2.674 km2 or 660.67 acres) is located on Sugar Island in the St. Marys River southeast of Sault Ste. Marie and within US boundaries. The tribe&#x27;s total land area at the time of organization in 1937 was , on which a population of 812 persons resided.

Since the late 20th century, the Tribe has acquired additional land, and now has a land base of approximately 3,494 acres (5.46 sq mi; 14.14 km2), of which 3,109 acres (4.86 sq mi; 12.58 km2) are held in trust by the federal government.

==Government==
The BMIC consists of approximately 1,309 enrolled members. It is governed by the General Tribal Council, which consists of all voting-age members of the tribe. Daily decisions are made by the Executive Council, which consists of five elected officials (president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, and councilperson).

The tribe operates Bay Mills Community College, an accredited tribal college, and Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino.

== Environment ==

=== Biological Services Department ===
The Biological Services Department strives to enhance, protect, and restore fish, wildlife, and plant communities, and bodies of water. Staff participate in research and monitoring of the environment on both tribal trust lands and the surrounding region. Major programs include Great Lakes fisheries assessments, inland fish and wildlife assessments, forest management, invasive species management, beach health monitoring, water quality assessments, and some recycling programs to reduce hazardous chemical entering the environment. Biological Services also provides outreach and education to the community in both public events and printed publications.

==== Recycling Initiatives ====
Bay Mills Biological Services Department seeks to prevent hazardous chemicals from entering the environment by supporting recycling and waste collection.

=== Law Support ===
Clean water is essential to the Bay Mills Indian Community. The Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to provide assistance to tribes to protect and maintain the waters in and around their land. The EPA awarded a grant of $124,400 to the Bay Mills Indian Community of Michigan to implement water resource and non-point source programs to protect human health and the environment. The funding allows the tribe to continue efforts that establish and implement ongoing water pollution control programs. It also supports water quality monitoring, and community education and outreach.

==Economy==
Following changes in state and national laws to allow gaming casinos on tribal reservations, in the mid-1990s, the tribe started working with casino syndicator Michael J. Malik, Sr. and Detroit businesswoman Marian Ilitch to develop a casino. It wanted to generate jobs and revenue for reinvestment in education and welfare of tribal members. Originally Malik and his partners had proposed that the tribe, in partnership with Harrah&#x27;s, build a casino in the area of Downtown Detroit referred to as Foxtown. In 1996 Michigan voters narrowly approved a ballot measure permitting three larger commercial casinos in Detroit, which would have provided too much competition.

For almost a decade BMIC and its partners worked to pursue land claims in the Hay Lake/Charlotte Beach area on the eastern shores of Michigan&#x27;s northern peninsula, believing that it had been denied adequate compensation from the federal government for lands it was forced to cede in the 19th century. BMIC wanted to trade such land in settlement agreements with the government for potentially more lucrative casino sites closer to population centers, such as Port Huron or elsewhere. BMIC representatives testified in hearings in Congress on this proposal in 2004.

The voters of Port Huron approved the proposal for Bay Mills casino in 2001. While the agreements were signed by the Governor of Michigan and approved by the legislature, they stalled in Congress. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10th) has introduced HR. 831 and Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow had previously introduced S.2986 to support this project.

The tribe later gained approval for a land deal at Brimley, Michigan, on Waiska Bay west of Sault Ste. Marie. Its Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino has 17,000 sq feet of casino space with 695 slots and 13 table games, 3 restaurants and 144-room hotel.

== Law ==

=== Legalization of Marijuana ===
After Michigan legalized the recreational use and sale of marijuana, the Bay Mills Indian Community voted to approve the legalization as well. They officially adopted the ordinance allowing individuals to cultivate, possess, and use marijuana on April 8, 2019. The Bay Mills Indian Community became the first tribe in the State of Michigan to legalize the recreational use of marijuana on the reservation. And under the tribe&#x27;s law, tribal members who have previous convictions in the tribal court for marijuana-based offenses can move to have those convictions vacated.

<doc id="794527" wikidata="Q204254" url="?curid=794527" title="Society of Exploration Geophysicists">
<text>The Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) is a learned society dedicated to promoting the science and education of exploration geophysics in particular and geophysics in general. The Society fosters the expert and ethical practice of geophysics in the exploration and development of natural resources, in characterizing the near-surface, and in mitigating earth hazards. SEG has more than 14,000 members working in more than 114 countries. SEG was founded in 1930 in Houston, Texas but its business office has been headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma since the mid-1940s. While most SEG members are involved in exploration for petroleum, SEG members also are involved in application of geophysics methods to mineral exploration as well as environmental and engineering problems, archaeology, and other scientific endeavors. SEG publishes &quot;The Leading Edge&quot; (&quot;TLE&quot;), a monthly professional magazine, &quot;Geophysics&quot;, a peer-reviewed archival publication, and &quot;Interpretation&quot;, a peer-reviewed journal co-published by SEG and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.

SEG&#x27;s Technical Standards Committee develops and maintains specifications for geophysical data. Most familiar of these standards are the SEG Y data format for storing seismic data.

==History==
SEG was founded in 1930 by 30 men and women who felt that the use of geophysical technology for petroleum exploration had matured to the point that a professional society was needed in order to facilitate the transfer of technical knowledge.

The Society started its own journal, &quot;Geophysics&quot;, in 1936. Membership grew significantly in the late 1930s and early 1940s and this required hiring a permanent staff to conduct the Society&#x27;s day-to-day operations. As a result, a business office was opened in Tulsa. Further growth necessitated commissioning permanent office space for the staff. One was opened in the 1960s and another, the Cecil and Ida Green Tower, in the 1980s.

SEG has always held an annual meeting but it was in conjunction with the AAPG convention until 1955. SEG began sponsoring an independent annual meeting in that year and it quickly became the world&#x27;s premier showcase for state-of-the-art geophysical instrumentation.

==Membership==
SEG memberships include several types to fit different needs. Members get full access to the SEG Digital Library, which includes &quot;Geophysics&quot;, &quot;The Leading Edge&quot;, SEG Technical Program &quot;Expanded Abstracts&quot;, and Robert E. Sheriff&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics&quot;, fourth edition. All members also receive the SEG &quot;Yearbook&quot; on a CD that also includes the previous year&#x27;s articles from &quot;Geophysics&quot; and &quot;TLE&quot;. Most members receive &quot;TLE&quot; in print, and &quot;Geophysics&quot; in print is available to members at a modest subscription rate.

In addition, members get lower pricing for reference publications at the SEG Book Mart, Annual Meeting registration, and professional development. SEG Online offers members a suite of services including an online messaging and collaboration tool, a career center, and group health and life insurance in cooperation with its partner society American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG).

==Meetings and events==
SEG has hosted meetings, conferences, workshops, forums, and expositions for the geosciences community for more than 78 years. These international events have taken place in numerous locations on six continents. In addition to serving its global membership, SEG works with other organizations, associated societies, and businesses around the world to create the most comprehensive listing of meetings as possible. These SEG international events bring together a global society in ventures of education, research, collaboration, and networking.

SEG&#x27;s Annual Meeting and International Exposition, held in cities including Houston, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and San Antonio, is the world&#x27;s largest gathering of exploration geophysics-related activities. Six days of Annual Meeting events deliver to geoscience professionals technical paper presentations, poster presentations, an exposition showcasing the latest in geoscience-related products and services, workshops, continuing education courses, tours, networking events, career services, and student events. It regularly brings together more than 8,000 exploration industry professionals from around the globe.

==Students==
In June 2013, SEG&#x27;s student membership totaled more than 12,000, with 297 active student chapters in 63 countries.

==SEG Foundation==
In 1958, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) formed a trust to provide scholarships for students of geophysics. Thirty years later, in response to the needs of a growing industry, that trust was transformed into the SEG Foundation.

Beginning in 1961, the Society has annually awarded its Reginald Fessenden Award to &quot;a person who has made a specific technical contribution to exploration geophysics&quot;.

In 2008, the SEG Foundation launched a program called Geoscientists Without Borders. The program helps geoscience students and experienced geoscientists apply their knowledge and technical skills towards the mitigation of natural disasters in some of the world&#x27;s neediest communities.

Other programs include the Distinguished Instructor Short Course (DISC), the Honorary Lecturer program, SEG Forums, and the newly launched SEG Online.

Since 1956, four thousand scholarships representing almost $5 million have been awarded to 1,900 individuals in the past 50 years. In addition to its ground breaking scholarship program, the SEG Foundation and its donors also fund student travel grants, leadership training, and field camps.

==Journals, books, and newsletters==
SEG&#x27;s publications program helps the society fulfill its mission of promoting the science of geophysics and the professional development of geoscientists by disseminating information about geophysical research and applications through a variety of channels. The reference publications program publishes a wide range of books, DVDs, CDs, videos, and slide sets in several series. These can be purchased online through the SEG Book Mart.

===Journals===
SEG publishes three journals. &quot;Geophysics&quot;, published by SEG since 1936, is an archival journal encompassing all aspects of research, exploration, and education in applied geophysics. &quot;The Leading Edge&quot; (&quot;TLE&quot;) is a gateway publication introducing new geophysical theory, instrumentation, and established practices to scientists in a wide range of geoscience disciplines. Most material is presented in a semitechnical manner that minimizes mathematical theory and emphasizes practical applications. SEG&#x27;s newest publication, &quot;Interpretation&quot;, launched in August 2013, is a peer-reviewed journal co-published by SEG and AAPG for advancing the practice of subsurface interpretation.

===SEG Digital Library===
The Digital Library is SEG&#x27;s online resource for the SEG research collection. SEG&#x27;s online offerings include electronic versions of &quot;Geophysics&quot; and &quot;TLE&quot;; the &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics&quot;, fourth edition; SEG Technical Program &quot;Expanded Abstracts&quot;; the multisociety Digital Cumulative Index; SEG Technical Standards; SEG news; the &quot;SEG Extra&quot; e-mail newsletter; and the SEG &quot;Yearbook&quot;. The Digital Library also offers research collections from the Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society (EEGS) and the Australian Society of Exploration Geophysicists (ASEG) societies.

==Professional Development==
SEG Professional Development consists of four programs:

*SEG Distinguished Instructor Short Course
*Continuing Education short courses
*Distinguished Lecturer
*Honorary Lecturer

===Distinguished Instructor Short Course (DISC)===
The SEG Distinguished Instructor Short Course (DISC) is SEG&#x27;s primary professional development program. The DISC is a one-day course taught by a prominent geophysicist on a current topic of interest to a broad audience of geoscientists. The DISC visits over 25 sites around the world each year.

===Continuing Education===
The backbone of the SEG Professional Development program is Continuing Education (CE). These short courses, taught by industry experts, cover topics from the fundamental to the leading edge of geophysics. CE courses are held in one of three ways: public courses, section-sponsored courses, and contract (in-house) courses. Public courses are sponsored directly by SEG, a series of courses called an [Education Week] is offered four times per year, once in west Houston, once in New Orleans, once in Calgary, and once in north Houston. Public courses are also offered each year the weekend prior to the SEG Annual Meeting.

Section-sponsored courses are sponsored by SEG sections or affiliated societies, and contract courses are sponsored by individual companies or organizations. Generally one or two days long, most courses can be expanded up to 5 days if desired.

===Distinguished Lecturer===
The Distinguished Lecturer (DL) program is offered two times per year. The Spring DL visits a minimum of 15 locations each year to present a lecture suitable for a lunch or dinner meeting of a local section or university group. Each year the DL is recorded and posted to the Distinguished Lecturers Presentation Library for free viewing by members and the public.

The Fall DL is sponsored jointly with the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG). SEG and AAPG alternate years administering the program.

===Honorary Lecturer===
SEG also offers the Honorary Lecturer (HL) program. The HL program is a companion program to the DL with a focus to transfer knowledge within a region. The regional focus strengthens services SEG provides to an expanding global membership. Lectures may be given in English or a language appropriate to the region.

The regions are Central and South America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, North America, the Pacific South, and South and East Asia.

==SEG Wiki==
The SEG Wiki launched in the winter of 2011, seeded with SEG&#x27;s number one bestseller, Robert E. Sheriff&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics&quot;. All entries in the SEG Wiki can be modified and improved by SEG members. All content in the wiki is published under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA), the same as Wikipedia.

Additional highlights in the SEG Wiki include:

*Biographies: Many of the pioneers in the development of exploration geophysics, including past SEG presidents, editors of &quot;Geophysics&quot;, and SEG Honors and Awards&#x27; winners.
*Open data: This section documents geophysical data that is readily available for download from the internet, via mail, or through special request.
*In early October 2014, SEG&#x27;s second bestselling book, &quot;Seismic Data Analysis&quot;, by Öz Yilmaz was added to the wiki.
*The geophysical tutorial series debuted in the February 2014 issue of &quot;The Leading Edge&quot;. The tutorials appear every other month to serve as a brief exploration of a geophysical topic.

<doc id="794534" wikidata="Q2627315" url="?curid=794534" title="Convex combination">
<text>In convex geometry and vector algebra, a convex combination is a linear combination of points (which can be vectors, scalars, or more generally points in an affine space) where all coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1. In other words, the operation is equivalent to a standard weighted average, but whose weights are expressed as a percent of the total weight, instead of as a fraction of the &quot;count&quot; of the weights as in a standard weighted average.
== Formal definition ==
More formally, given a finite number of points formula_1 in a real vector space, a convex combination of these points is a point of the form
: formula_2
where the real numbers formula_3 satisfy formula_4 and formula_5

As a particular example, every convex combination of two points lies on the line segment between the points.

A set is convex if it contains all convex combinations of its points.
The convex hull of a given set of points is identical to the set of all their convex combinations.

There exist subsets of a vector space that are not closed under linear combinations but are closed under convex combinations. For example, the interval formula_6 is convex but generates the real-number line under linear combinations. Another example is the convex set of probability distributions, as linear combinations preserve neither nonnegativity nor affinity (i.e., having total integral one).

== Other objects ==
* A random variable formula_7 is said to have an formula_8-component finite mixture distribution if its probability density function is a convex combination of formula_8 so-called component densities.

== Related constructions ==

* A conical combination is a linear combination with nonnegative coefficients. When a point formula_10 is to be used as the reference origin for defining displacement vectors, then formula_10 is a convex combination of formula_8 points formula_1 if and only if the zero displacement is a non-trivial conical combination of their formula_8 respective displacement vectors relative to formula_10.
* Weighted means are functionally the same as convex combinations, but they use a different notation. The coefficients (weights) in a weighted mean are not required to sum to 1; instead the weighted linear combination is explicitly divided by the sum of the weights.
* Affine combinations are like convex combinations, but the coefficients are not required to be non-negative. Hence affine combinations are defined in vector spaces over any field.

<doc id="794535" wikidata="Q1806994" url="?curid=794535" title="Latitudinarian">
<text>Latitudinarians, or latitude men, were initially a group of 17th-century English theologiansclerics and academicsfrom the University of Cambridge who were moderate Anglicans (members of the Church of England). In particular, they believed that adhering to very specific doctrines, liturgical practices, and church organizational forms, as did the Puritans, was not necessary and could be harmful: &quot;The sense that one had special instructions from God made individuals less amenable to moderation and compromise, or to reason itself.&quot; Thus, the latitudinarians supported a broad-based (&quot;sensu lato&quot;, with &quot;laxitude&quot;) Protestantism. They were later referred to as broad church (see also Inclusivism).

Examples of the latitudinarian philosophy underlying the theology were found among the Cambridge Platonists and Sir Thomas Browne in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot;. Additionally, the term latitudinarian has been applied to ministers of the Scottish Episcopal Church who were educated at the Episcopal-sympathizing universities at Aberdeen and StAndrews, and who broadly subscribed to the beliefs of their moderate Anglican English counterparts.

Today, latitudinarianism should not be confused with ecumenical movements, which seek to draw all Christian churches together, rather than seeking to de-emphasize practical doctrine. The term latitudinarian has taken on a more general meaning, indicating a personal philosophy that includes tolerance of other views, particularly, but not necessarily, on religious matters.

In the Catholic Church, latitudinarianism was condemned in the 19th-century document &quot;Quanta cura&quot;. Pope Pius IX felt that, with its emphasis on religious liberty and the freedom to discard traditional Christian doctrines and dogmas, latitudinarianism threatened to undermine the church. (See Syllabus of Errors)

==Original meaning==
The latitudinarian Anglicans of the 17thcentury built on Richard Hooker&#x27;s position in &quot;Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot;. Hooker (1554–1600) argues that what God cares about is the moral state of the individual soul. Aspects such as church leadership are &quot;things indifferent&quot;. However, the latitudinarians took a position far beyond Hooker&#x27;s own and extended it to doctrinal matters.

As a positive position, the latitudinarian view held that human reason, when combined with the Holy Spirit, is a sufficient guide for the determination of truth in doctrinal contests; therefore, legal and doctrinal rulings that constrain reason and the freedom of the believer were neither necessary nor beneficial. At the time, their position was referred to as an aspect of low church (in contrast to the high church position). Later, the latitudinarian position was called broad church.

While always officially opposed by the Anglican church, the latitudinarian philosophy was, nevertheless, dominant in 18th-century England. Because of the Hanoverian reluctance to act in church affairs, and the various groups of the religious debates being balanced against one another, the dioceses became tolerant of variation in local practice. Furthermore, after George I of Great Britain dismissed the Convocation, there was very little internal Church power to either sanction or approve.

Thus, with no Archbishop of Canterbury officially announcing it, nor Lords adopting it, latitudinarianism was the operative philosophy of the English church in the 18th century. For the 18th-century English church in the United States (which would become the Episcopal Church after the American Revolution), some are of the opinion that latitudinarianism was the only practical course because the nation had official pluralism, diversity of opinion, and diffusion of clerical power.

<doc id="794540" wikidata="Q5115880" url="?curid=794540" title="Chuckle Brothers">
<text>The Chuckle Brothers were an English comedy double act comprising real-life brothers Barry David Elliott (24 December 1944 – 5 August 2018) and Paul Harman Elliott (born 18 October 1947). They were known for their BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;ChuckleVision&quot;, which aired from 1987 to 2009 and celebrated its twenty-first series with a 2010 stage tour titled &quot;An Audience with the Chuckle Brothers&quot;. The comedy of the Chuckle Brothers usually derived from slapstick, other visual gags, and wordplay, and their catchphrases included &quot;To me, to you!&quot; and &quot;Oh dear, oh dear!&quot;

==Early life==
The brothers were born in Rotherham to Amy and James Patton Elliott, in 1944 and 1947. Their father was a Gang Show performer whose stage name was Gene Patton; he worked with the 18-year-old Peter Sellers in 1943 in The No. 10 Gang and gave performances in London, Orkney and the Hebrides, Iceland, the Far East, India, and Burma. Their two older brothers, Jimmy and Brian, were known professionally as the Patton Brothers until Jimmy&#x27;s death in 2019. The Patton Brothers appeared in &quot;ChuckleVision&quot;, Jimmy as the nameless character known colloquially as &quot;No Slacking&quot;, and Brian as another unnamed character known as &quot;Getoutofit&quot;.

The Chuckle Brothers gained wider attention as a support act for singer Dorothy Squires.

==Career==
===Television===
The Chuckle Brothers, performing as The Harman Brothers, won the television talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in 1967, followed by success on &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1974. The brothers began their television careers as a double act, making their debut in April 1979 on the BBC comedy series &quot;Lennie and Jerry&quot;, hosted by Lennie Bennett and Jerry Stevens. They made two appearances on the game show &quot;3-2-1&quot;, hosted by Ted Rogers, in January 1980 and April 1982, and appeared on the long-running BBC programme, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, in June 1980. In August 1983, the Brothers appeared on &quot;The Freddie Starr Showcase&quot; alongside the comedian Freddie Starr.

Their primary work was mainly focused on children&#x27;s television, beginning initially on Christmas Day in 1980 with their taking part in a televised children&#x27;s show, &quot;A Merry Morning&quot;, in which the brothers entertained around 250 children from the Leeds area in Yeadon Town Hall.

In 1985, the brothers launched a pre-school programme on the BBC entitled &quot;Chuckle Hounds&quot;, in which they performed routines with no dialogue, while dressed up in giant dog costumes. Their success in children&#x27;s television came in 1987, with the launch of their iconic children&#x27;s show, &quot;ChuckleVision&quot;, in which their real-life siblings Jimmy and Brian Patton made occasional appearances. The show proved a ratings hit with children, running for 21 series over a period of 22 years, and giving them a Special Award for Lifetime Achievement at the British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards in 2008. The final series of the programme was aired in December 2009.

The two contributed further to children&#x27;s entertainment, performing at the &quot;Children&#x27;s Royal Variety Performance&quot; in May 1992, and launching a children&#x27;s game show titled &quot;To Me... To You...&quot;, which ran between 1996 and 1998 and which took its name from their signature catchphrase.

Outside of children&#x27;s entertainment, the brothers have made appearances in many other television series, both together and separately. In May 2008, they appeared in the BBC documentary series &quot;Comedy Map of Britain&quot;, and won the 2010 series of &quot;Celebrity Coach Trip&quot;. In November 2011, the brothers starred in a series of TV advertisements for the UK-based van insurance comparison website &quot;Van Compare.com&quot; In October 2012, they appeared on &quot;Comedy World Cup&quot; on &quot;Channel 4&quot;, while on 15 March 2013, they were featured in David Walliams&#x27; sketch for &quot;Comic Relief.&quot; From 2013 to 2014, Barry made a number of appearances in the BBC comedy series &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; as dog owner Mr Marshall, first appearing in the role for the 2013 Christmas special. On 13 March 2015, they appeared again on Comic Relief, this time in a sketch based around &quot;National Treasures&quot;. The duo appeared at the 2016 &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;, performing sketches with host David Walliams. In April 2018, it was announced the brothers were in the process of recording a new clip show for Channel 5, entitled &quot;Chuckle Time&quot;; It ran for one series during the summer of that year, although it was cut short following the death of Barry Elliott in August 2018.

===Stage===

As well as regular TV appearances, Paul and Barry appeared on stage in venues across the UK. Their annual nationwide tours often included them performing with The Patton Brothers, magic duo &quot;Safire&quot;, &quot;The Magic Light Puppet Company&quot; as well a full cast. Their comedy and parody shows have included &quot;The Blackpool Tower Circus&quot; (1974, 1987), &quot;To You To Me&quot; (1995), &quot;The Chuckle Brothers in Trouble&quot; (1996), &quot;The Chuckle Brothers Summer Roadshow&quot; (1997), &quot;The Adventures of The Chuckle Brothers&quot; (1998), &quot;The Chuckle Brothers Trouble At Sea&quot; (1999), &quot;The New Adventures of The Chuckle Brothers&quot; (2000), &quot;Spooky Goings On&quot; (2001), &quot;Raiders of the Lost Bark&quot; (2002), &quot;Star Doors – The Chuckle Brothers Strike Back&quot; (2003), &quot;Barry Potty and his Smarter Brother Paul in The Chamber of Horrors&quot; (2004), &quot;Pirates of the River Rother&quot; (2005), &quot;Doctor What and the Return of the Garlics&quot; (2006), &quot;Spooky Goings on 2&quot; (2007), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (Christmas 2007), &quot;Indiana Chuckles and the Kingdom of the Mythical Sulk&quot; (2008), &quot;Chuckle Trek – The Lost Generation&quot; (2009), &quot;A Christmas Chuckle&quot; (Christmas 2009), &quot;An Audience With...The Chuckle Brothers&quot; (2010), &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; (Christmas 2010), &quot;Barry Potty and his Full Blood Brother Paul in the Ghostly Shadows&quot; (2011), &quot;The Return of the Pirates of the River Rother 2: In Strangers Tights&quot; (2012), &quot;The Chuckle Brothers meet the Phantom at the Theatre&quot; (2013), &quot;A 2014 Space Oddity&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Chuckles of Oz&quot; (2015).

Live recordings of &quot;Pirates of the River Rother&quot; and &quot;Spooky Goings On 2&quot; were released on DVD 2007, the latter under the title &quot;The Chuckle Brothers – Spooky Goings On Live!&quot; A box set of the two was also made available. A dress rehearsal of the duo&#x27;s 1996 tour &quot;The Chuckle Brothers in Trouble&quot; was released on DVD in 2008. In addition, the brothers&#x27; 2008 tour, &quot;Indiana Chuckles and The Kingdom of the Mythical Sulk&quot;, set in Ancient Egypt, was released on DVD later that year.

The brothers toured theatres annually with their shows until 2015. Although, they performed regularly in pantomimes, festivals, events and holiday parks until Barry&#x27;s death in 2018.

During their career, Paul and Barry performed in fifty one pantomimes together. Their first was &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, which they performed as &quot;The Harman Brothers&quot; in Malvern from 1967 until 1968 with Sandy Powell. Their final pantomime became &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at The Mayflower Theatre in Southampton, which they appeared in from 2017 until 2018 with Craig Revel Horwood. They were awarded a &quot;Great British Pantomime Award&quot; for Best Double Act for this production. Since Barry&#x27;s death, Paul has stated his intention to continue to appear in pantomime productions.

===Other appearances===
In 2010, the Chuckle Brothers won the first &quot;Celebrity Coach Trip&quot;.

From 2014 until 2018, the brothers made appearances at various nightclubs and student events, performing sets and posing for photographs. After Barry&#x27;s death, Paul stated that he would continue with these appearances.

In March 2016, the brothers appeared in a promotional video for the computer game &quot;Hitman&quot;.

In 2017, both brothers appeared in &quot;The Funniest Man in the World&quot;, a short film directed by Jon Conway about Joseph Grimaldi, played by Barry.

Following Barry&#x27;s death, Paul has appeared in a number of quiz shows for charity, including &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;, &quot;Tenable All Stars&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;.

===Music===
In October 1995, the Chuckle Brothers released an album entitled &quot;To You to Me&quot; featuring eleven tracks. Many of the tracks were based on their catchphrases, such as &quot;To me, to you&quot; and &quot;Silly You, Silly Me&quot;.

In October 2014, the Chuckle Brothers collaborated with Tinchy Stryder to release a charity single &quot;To Me, To You (Bruv)&quot; to raise funds for the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust.

In September 2015, the Brothers performed for twenty minutes at the music festival Bestival, citing it as the biggest crowd they had ever performed in front of.

===Mobile game===
In July 2016, the Chuckle Brothers released their first mobile app for Android and iOS titled &quot;Chuckle World&quot;. It is a quiz game with Tinder style sliding mechanics and endless style mobile gameplay.

==Critical reception==
In November 2005, Jacques Peretti, a reporter for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, remarked &quot;The appeal of the Chuckle Brothers remains a mystery to anyone over eight, but to anyone under eight, they&#x27;re the ultimate entertainment experience. The little people think they&#x27;re hilarious, and if you add up all the little people across the country who think they&#x27;re hilarious, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s &quot;ChuckleVision&quot; that should have the 28 comedy gongs, not &quot;Little Britain&quot; or &quot;The Office&quot;.&quot;

On 31 January 2007, Rotherham United chairman Denis Coleman announced that the brothers had both been made honorary presidents of the football club.

In 2008, they were honoured with the Special Award at the British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards.

==Personal life==
The brothers regularly appeared at events and openings, an example being the unveiling of the Tropical Butterfly House, Wildlife and Falconry Centre in North Anston in South Yorkshire in July 2013, which Barry attended. Supporters of Rotherham United Football Club, they were made Honorary Life Presidents of the club in 2007.

Both brothers have been married: Barry was married to Ann from 1973 until his death and Paul has been married to Sue since 1988. Both brothers were smokers, although Paul had apparently quit by 2000. Paul lives in , Doncaster, while Barry lived in Ravenfield, Rotherham, until his death.

In April 2007, while on holiday on the Greek island of Cephalonia, Paul broke his nose and suffered cuts and bruises when he lost control of his motorcycle after suddenly braking to avoid a goatherd and his herd. It was reported at the time that, instead of helping him, tourists who stopped at the accident shouted the Chuckle Brothers&#x27; catchphrase, &quot;To me, to you&quot;. Paul later revealed on Richard Herring&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast that the story of tourists shouting out catchphrases was an invention in order to get the story in the newspapers.

An urban legend surrounding Barry Chuckle&#x27;s supposed death from a heart attack had circulated since at least 2008. In 2010, the brothers issued a statement on their website stating that the story was &quot;complete and utter rubbish&quot;. The BBC reported that the death hoaxes had upset young viewers, and had shocked Barry when they re-surfaced. The hoax was said to have initially spread via Facebook in 2008, but re-surfaced in 2010 via Twitter.

In December 2010, Barry announced his support for a proposal that one of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government&#x27;s planned free schools, a taxpayer-funded school independent of the local authority, should be established in Rotherham. In January 2011, it was announced that Barry had planned to incorporate a 100-pupil free school named &quot;Rotherham Central Free School&quot; in his hometown of Rotherham. His son&#x27;s partner was to serve as the head teacher of the school. By February 2012, no premises, staff or pupils for the school had been confirmed, despite announcing an intention on opening in September of that year.

In February 2014, the Chuckle Brothers attended the trial of Dave Lee Travis. Paul stated that he had no knowledge of the alleged events. After giving evidence, the pair posed for a selfie outside Southwark Crown Court with Paul sharing it on his Twitter account. The Brothers had smiled for the photograph, and some deemed their actions inappropriate.

In March 2016, Barry received condemnation for sharing a Facebook post from the far-right political party Britain First. The post, originally shared in June 2015, called on politicians to strip migrants of their citizenship if they left the country to join a terror group. Following the unearthing of the post, Tommy Robinson, former leader of the English Defence League (EDL), came to Barry&#x27;s defence, calling on people to &quot;leave the man alone&quot;. Britain First subsequently described the incident as a &quot;non-story&quot;.

In March 2020, Paul contracted COVID-19 and suffered mild illness (which he described as &quot;not nice&quot;). He recorded a video message for his Twitter followers, urging them to stay at home to slow the spread of the disease.

=== Barry&#x27;s death ===
On 5 August 2018, Barry died after a period of ill health. Paul grieved Barry&#x27;s death: &quot;I&#x27;ve not just lost my brother, I&#x27;ve lost my theatrical partner of many, many years and my very best friend.&quot;

Paul later revealed that his brother had been diagnosed with bone cancer, but had kept it secret from his manager, fans and Paul himself as he had wanted to perform for as long as possible. His funeral was held on 17 August at the New York Stadium, where Rotherham United play their home matches, and was attended by a number of show business friends; a large number of fans waited outside to pay their respects.

<doc id="794541" wikidata="Q4048912" url="?curid=794541" title="STU-III">
<text>STU-III (Secure Telephone Unit - third generation) is a family of secure telephones introduced in 1987 by the NSA for use by the United States government, its contractors, and its allies. STU-III desk units look much like typical office telephones, plug into a standard telephone wall jack and can make calls to any ordinary phone user (with such calls receiving no special protection, however). When a call is placed to another STU-III unit that is properly set up, one caller can ask the other to initiate secure transmission. They then press a button on their telephones and, after a 15-second delay, their call is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. There are portable and militarized versions and most STU-IIIs contained an internal modem and RS-232 port for data and fax transmission. Vendors were AT&amp;T (later transferred to Lucent Technologies), RCA (now L-3 Communications, East) and Motorola.

STU-III are no longer in service with the U.S. Government, with the last cryptographic keys for the units expiring on December 31, 2009. It has been replaced by the STE (Secure Terminal Equipment) and other equipment using the more modern Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol (SCIP).

==Versions==

* STU-III/Low Cost Terminal (LCT) designed for use in office environment by all types of users. (Motorola Sectel 1500, Lucent Technologies/GD 1100 and 1150)
* STU-III/Cellular Telephone (CT) is interoperable with all STU-III versions. Works in all continental US mobile network and in most of the foreign cellular networks.
* STU-III/Allied (A) specialized version of the STU-III/LCT that is compatible with the STU-II. It retains all basic STU-III functions and capabilities and incorporates STU-II BELLFIELD KDC, STU-II net, and STU-II multipoint modes of operation.
* STU-III/Remote Control Interface (R or RCU)
* STU-III/MultiMedia Terminal (MMT)
* STU-III/Inter Working Function (IWF)
* STU-III/Secure Data Device (SDD)
* STU-III/CipherTAC 2000 (CTAC)

==Security==

Most STU-III units were built for use with what NSA calls Type 1 encryption. This allows them to protect conversations at all security classification levels up to Top Secret, with the maximum level permitted on a call being the lower clearance level of the two persons talking. At the height of the Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program, Type 2, 3, and 4 STU-IIIs were manufactured, but they saw little commercial success.

Two major factors in the STU-III&#x27;s success were the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) and the use of a removable memory module in a plastic package in the shape of a house key, called a KSD-64A. The EKMS is believed to be one of the first widespread applications of asymmetric cryptography. It greatly reduced the complex logistics and bookkeeping associated with ensuring each encryption device has the right keys and that all keying material is protected and accounted for.
The KSD-64A contains a 64 kbit EEPROM chip that can be used to store various types of keying and other information. A new (or zeroized) STU-III must first have a &quot;seed key&quot; installed. This key is shipped from NSA by registered mail or Defense Courier Service. Once the STU-III has its seed key, the user calls a toll-free number at NSA to have the seed key converted into an operational key. A list of compromised keys is downloaded to the STU-III at this time. The operational key is supposed to be renewed at least once a year.

The operational key is then split into two components, one of which replaces the information on the KSD-64A, at which point it becomes a Crypto Ignition Key or CIK. When the CIK is removed from the STU-III telephone neither unit is considered classified. Only when the CIK is inserted into the STU-III on which it was created can classified information be received and sent.

When a call &quot;goes secure&quot;, the two STU-III&#x27;s create a unique key that will be used to encrypt just the call being placed. Each unit first makes sure that the other is not using a revoked key and if one has a more up-to-date key revocation list, it transmits it to the other. Presumably the revocation lists are protected by a digital signature generated by NSA.

While there have been no reports of STU-III encryption being broken, there have been claims that foreign intelligence services can recognize the lines on which STU-IIIs are installed and that un-encrypted calls on these lines, particularly what was said while waiting for the &quot;go secure&quot; command to complete, have provided valuable information.

==Use==
Hundreds of thousands of STU-III sets were produced and many were still in use as of 2004. STU-III replaced earlier voice encryption devices, including the KY-3 (1960s), the STU-I (1970) and the STU-II (1975). The STU-II had some 10,000 users. These, in turn, replaced less secure voice scramblers. Unlike earlier systems, the STU-III&#x27;s encryption electronics are completely contained in the desk set. Further, the reduced bandwidth required by a STU-III permitted it to be used for encrypted voice communications even over limited conduits such as the commercial maritime communication satellites of the day. The STU-III is no longer in use, having been replaced by the STE (Secure Terminal Equipment) or OMNI, more modern, all digital systems that overcome many of the STU-III&#x27;s problems, including the 15 second delay.

Operational difficulties in using STU-III phones hindered coordination between the Federal Aviation Administration and NORAD during the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. &quot;See&quot; Communication during the September 11 attacks.

STE succeeded STU-III in the 1990s. Similar to STU-III, an STE unit physically resembles an ordinary telephone. Besides connecting to a regular wall phone jack (Public Switched Telephone Network), the STE was originally designed to be connected to Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines. As a result, in addition to having secured voice conversations, users can also use an STE unit for classified data and fax transmissions. Transfer rate of an STE is also considerably higher (STU-III: up to 9 kbit/s; STE: up to 128 kbit/s). Lastly, an STE unit is backward compatible with an STU-III unit when both units are connected to the PSTN.

The heart of an STE unit is the Fortezza Plus (KOV-14) Crypto Card, which is a PCMCIA card. It contains both the cryptographic algorithms as well as the key(s) used for encryption. Cryptographic algorithms include BATON, FIREFLY, and SDNS signature algorithm. When the Crypto Card is removed from the STE unit, neither the phone or the card is considered classified. BATON is a block cipher developed by the NSA with a block size of 128 bits and key size of 320 bits. FIREFLY, on the other hand, is a key distribution protocol developed by the NSA. The FIREFLY protocol uses public key cryptography to exchange keys between two participants of a secured call.

Both STU-III and STE are built on technologies that are proprietary, and details of the cryptographic algorithms (BATON and FIREFLY) are classified. Although the secrecy of the algorithms does not make the device less secure, it does limit the usage to within the U.S. government and its allies. Within the Department of Defense, Voice over IP (VoIP) has slowly emerged as an alternative solution to STU-III and STE. The high bandwidth of IP networks makes VoIP attractive because it results in voice quality superior to STU-III and STE. To secure VoIP calls, VoIP phones are connected to classified IP networks (e.g. Secret Internet Protocol Router Network – SIPRNET).

Both allies and adversaries of the United States are interested in STU-III, STE, and other secured voice technologies developed by the NSA. To date, there has not been any reported cryptanalysis on the encryption algorithms used by the STU-III and STE. Any breaks in these algorithms could jeopardize national security.

Information about STU-III is very limited despite the fact that it is out of production. Because of the sensitive nature of the subject, there are few relevant documents available. The majority of the information available originates from the manufacturers (e.g. L-3 Communications) of STU-III and STE.

<doc id="794545" wikidata="Q465506" url="?curid=794545" title="Cuthred of Wessex">
<text>Cuthred or Cuþræd was the King of Wessex from 740 (739 according to Simeon of Durham, 741 according to John of Worcester) until 756. He succeeded Æthelheard, his relative and possibly his brother.

Cuthred inherited the kingdom while Mercia was at its peak. The two kingdoms often fought in Cuthred&#x27;s first three years, but it appears that Æthelbald of Mercia was Wessex&#x27;s overlord and that Æthelbald compelled Cuthred to join him in fighting the Welsh in 743. This alliance would not last long.

Cuthred&#x27;s reign was a troubled time. In 748, the Ætheling Cynric, son of Cuthred, attempted to depose his father but he was killed. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Æthelbald may have encouraged Cynric to rebel.

In 750, the ealdorman Æthelhun led an unsuccessful rebellion he was winning until he was severely injured.

In 752, Cuthred, assisted by the now faithful Æthelhun, led a successful rebellion against Æthelbald at Battle Edge in Burford and secured independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign. He is also said to have fought the Cornish in 753.

Cuthred died in 756, but he left a stronger and more independent Wessex. He was succeeded by Sigeberht who is identified as his distant relative.

<text>Homo sacer (Latin for &quot;the sacred man&quot; or &quot;the accursed man&quot;) is a figure of Roman law: a person who is banned and might be killed by anybody, but must not be sacrificed in a religious ritual. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben takes the concept as the starting point of his main work &quot;Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life&quot; (1998).

== The &quot;homo sacer&quot; in Roman antiquity ==

The meaning of the term &quot;sacer&quot; in Ancient Roman religion is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as &quot;sacred&quot;. In early Roman religion &quot;sacer&quot; denotes anything &quot;set apart&quot; from common society and encompasses both the sense of &quot;hallowed&quot; and that of &quot;cursed&quot;. The &quot;homo sacer&quot; could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all rights and all functions in civil religion.

A definition of &quot;homo sacer&quot; is found in Festus, who states &#x27;homo sacer is est quem populus iudicavit ob maleficium; neque fas est eum immolari, sed qui occidit parricidi non damnatur&#x27;. &quot;Homo sacer&quot; is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed. The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. The term &quot;sacred man&quot; could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.

A direct reference to this status is found in the Twelve Tables (8.21), the laws of the early Roman Republic written in the fifth century BC. The paragraph states that a patron who deceives his clients is to be regarded as &quot;sacer&quot;.

The status of &quot;homo sacer&quot; could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An oath in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or more deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.

== Related cultural concepts ==

The sense of the Latin adjective &quot;sacer&quot; both overlaps and also contrasts with the Hebrew concept of ḥērem, &quot;cursed, prohibited.&quot; That which is &quot;cherem,&quot; such as spoil taken in war, is dedicated to God and therefore sacred; but it is also accursed, so that if it is appropriated by a secular person, that person and even their family could become &quot;cherem&quot; and stoned to death.

The idea of the status of an outlaw, a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persisted throughout the Middle Ages. Medieval perception condemned the entire human race to the intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a &quot;wolf&quot; or &quot;wolf&#x27;s-head&quot; (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element) and is first revoked only by the English Habeas Corpus Act 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.

<text>Catharine Elizabeth Edwards (born March 4, 1982) is an American attorney. Edwards is the daughter of former United States Senator John Edwards and Elizabeth Edwards.

==Early life and education==
Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her parents were practicing attorneys, Edwards was educated in the Wake County Public School System. She attended Aldert Root Elementary School, Daniels Middle School, and Needham B. Broughton High School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In high school, she played soccer, basketball, and softball, and was named All-Conference and Most Valuable Player her senior year. Her siblings are: Wade (1979–1996), Emma Claire (born 1998), Jack (born 2000) and half sibling Quinn (2008) her fathers daughter with Rielle Hunter.

Edwards attended Princeton University, majoring in political economics, and graduating with honors. She is a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority, and was an intern for the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Political activity and career==

In 2004, Edwards accompanied her father on the campaign trail and campaigned on his behalf while he pursued the Democratic presidential nomination, a venture that ultimately proved to be unsuccessful.

After the presidential election, she lived in New York City and worked as an editorial assistant for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. While in New York, she and co-worker Jessica Flint founded an online Rolodex called UrbanistaOnline to help young newcomers settle into New York. In 2004, she also became a member of the board of directors of the youth voter initiative Generation Engage. She was an active campaigner during her father&#x27;s 2008 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. In the fall of 2012, she returned to the college campus of Winthrop University, where she spoke to students about the importance of voting and the necessity of refusing to be a bystander in our democracy.

Edwards entered Harvard Law School in the fall 2006. In the summer after her first year in law school, she worked as intern to Nina Totenberg at NPR. In fall 2007, she became a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. Edwards graduated from Harvard Law in 2009. She then moved to Washington, D.C., and served as a judicial law clerk for Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the Eastern District of Virginia before joining a civil rights law firm in Washington, D.C. She temporarily left the practice of law in May 2011, after the death of her mother, Elizabeth, to start a foundation in her mother&#x27;s honor. She returned to the practice of law in mid-2012 and was a partner at Edwards Kirby, the law firm of her father and attorneys David Kirby and William Bystrynski before she founded her own law firm called Edwards Beightol with fellow litigator Kristen Beightol in 2021. 

===Gay marriage stance===
Early in the 2004 presidential campaign, Edwards became the first family member of the Democratic candidates to state that she was in favor of legalizing gay marriage. On September 30, 2007, during a campaign stop with actor James Denton, she was quoted by CNN as saying: &quot;I&#x27;m on my mom&#x27;s side with this, not my dad&#x27;s. It&#x27;s the word &#x27;marriage&#x27; that he is hung up on&quot;. The news organization then went on to state in its report that John Edwards &quot;does not support gay marriage, but his wife, Elizabeth, does&quot;. (John Edwards supported civil unions, while Elizabeth Edwards had stated that she supported gay marriage.) She also declared her support for Trevor Thomas, an openly gay candidate for U.S. Congress in Michigan. As part of her former law practice at Edwards and Eubanks, she represented clients faced with discrimination based on their sexual orientation.

==Personal life==
Edwards married her longtime boyfriend, cardiothoracic surgeon Trevor Upham, in October 2011. They have three children.

Cate Edwards stood by her father, John Edwards, as he faced felony charges of conspiracy, false statements, and campaign law violations for the cover-up of $925,000 in illicit campaign contributions. John Edwards was acquitted on one federal count on May 31, 2012, while a jury deadlocked on five other counts. Edwards was not retried on any of the outstanding charges and resumed his law practice.

<text>James Campbell, [[Esquire|Esq.]] (February 4, 1826 – April 21, 1900) was a Scots-Irish industrialist in sugar cane processing, who became one of the largest landowners in the United States Territory of Hawaii, and a real estate developer. He was an immigrant to Hawaii from Ireland. At the age of 51, he married for a second time, to a young woman who was a daughter of Hawaiian aristocracy. They had eight children, four of whom survived to adulthood. One of their daughters married into the ruling family, and their grandchildren were heirs to the throne of the kingdom of Hawaii.

He established the Estate of James Campbell for his heirs, which continued for more than 100 years as one of the largest landowners in the islands. In 2007 more than 170 heirs agreed to rework it as the James Campbell Company; only three cashed out.

==Early years==
James Campbell was born on February 4, 1826, to Scots-Irish William Campbell (1788–1879) and Martha Adams (1794–1871) in Derry, Ireland. Campbell was the eighth of twelve children. At the age of thirteen, Campbell boarded a ship leaving Ireland for Canada. He joined his brother John in New York City and worked for him. For two years in the United States, Campbell followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a carpenter.

In 1841 he joined a whaling crew bound for the South Pacific; the vessel was shipwrecked in the Tuamotu Islands. Campbell and two shipmates were the only ones to survive by clinging onto debris and floating to a nearby island. They were captured by natives and held prisoner. Campbell persuaded the chief he could be useful by using his skill to make repairs, and their lives were spared. After a few months he escaped on a ship bound for Tahiti, where he settled and lived for several years.

In 1850, the young Ulsterman boarded another whaling ship which reached the port of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Campbell took up carpentry again to make a living. In Lahaina he married Hannah Barla, who died in 1858, when he was about 32.

In 1860, Campbell formed a partnership with entrepreneurs Henry Turton and James Dunbar. They established a sugar-processing plant, Pioneer Mill Company. Dunbar sold out of the business early on. The partners also bought the Lahaina Sugar Company when it went bankrupt in 1863. With the boom in the sugar industry in the Kingdom of Hawaii and high international demand, Campbell became one of the wealthiest people in Lahaina. He used his profits to purchase land on the islands of Oahu, Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii.

In 1877, Campbell sold his interest in the Pioneer Mill for half a million dollars to Turton. The Pioneer Mill produced sugar until 1999.

==Family life==

On October 30, 1877, the 51-year-old Campbell married 19-year-old Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright (1859–1908), a Hawaiian woman of aristocratic family. (She had some Caucasian ancestry on her father&#x27;s side.) 
In 1878 he bought a house in Honolulu from Archibald Scott Cleghorn. Cleghorn was brother-in-law to King Kalākaua. Victoria Kaiulani was born in that house.

The Campbells had four surviving children of eight born: Abigail, Alice Kamokilaikawai Campbell, Beatrice, and Muriel Campbell. Four other children, including a son James Campbell, Jr., died young. Abigail would marry Prince David Kawānanakoa of the reigning House of Kalākaua and assume the title of Princess of Hawaii. They had three children: Princess Abigail Kapiolani Kawānanakoa, Prince David Kalākaua Kawānanakoa, and Princess Lydia Liliuokalani Kawānanakoa. These children would later become heirs to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii as the House of Kawānanakoa.

==Land holdings==

While raising his family, Campbell ventured into real estate with purchases of extensive parcels of land. One of his most controversial purchases was of flat, arid and barren 41,000 acres (166 km²) in the Ewa District of Oahu. Other businessmen criticized Campbell for making what appeared to be such a wasteful, unproductive investment and called him insane. In 1879 Campbell hired James Ashley of California to drill the first artesian well in Hawaii to use to irrigate his lands with fresh water. Campbell cultivated the land for sugarcane production and generated great profits from this property. Campbell continued to purchase underestimated plots of real estate and transformed them into productive agricultural districts.

He was appointed to serve in the House of Nobles (upper house of the legislature) in 1887 and 1888.
He and his wife were loyal supporters of Queen Liliuokalani at the time of her overthrow by the United States in 1893.

In August 1896 while in San Francisco, Campbell was kidnapped by Oliver Winthrop, who pretended to be asking real estate advice. Winthrop and an unknown accomplice took $305 from him and threatened to shoot him if he did not write them a check for $20,000. After being held for two days without food or water and enduring several beatings, he refused any ransom. The 70-year-old Campbell was released. Winthrop never testified, but was found guilty at trial.

Campbell died on April 21, 1900, with US$3 million to his name, left in trust to his children and their heirs, and extensive property owned by his estate.

==Campbell Estate==
Kapolei, a new suburb of Honolulu, was developed from part of the land in his estate. In 2004 his 176 beneficiaries decided to form the &quot;James Campbell Company&quot; to manage the real estate of the Campbell Estate.
The conversion happened in January 2007, with only three family members cashing out.

==Legacy==
What is now known as the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge was leased from the estate in 1976. It was purchased and expanded in 2005.

James Campbell High School was named for him.

The James and Abigail Campbell Family Foundation was founded in 1980.
