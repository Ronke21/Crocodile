<text>A voltage multiplier is an electrical circuit that converts AC electrical power from a lower voltage to a higher DC voltage, typically using a network of capacitors and diodes.

Voltage multipliers can be used to generate a few volts for electronic appliances, to millions of volts for purposes such as high-energy physics experiments and lightning safety testing. The most common type of voltage multiplier is the half-wave series multiplier, also called the Villard cascade (but actually invented by Heinrich Greinacher).

==Operation==
Assuming that the peak voltage of the AC source is +Us, and that the C values are sufficiently high to allow, when charged, that a current flows with no significant change in voltage, then the (simplified) working of the cascade is as follows:

# going from positive peak (+Us) to negative peak (−Us): The C1 capacitor is charged through diode D1 to Us V (potential difference between left and right plate of the capacitor is Us).
# going from negative peak to positive peak: The voltage of C1 adds with that of the source, thus charging C2 to 2Us through D2 and discharging C1 in the process.
# positive to negative peak: Voltage of C1 has dropped to 0 V by the end of the previous step, thus allowing C3 to be charged through D3 to 2Us.
# negative to positive peak: Voltage of C2 rises to 2Us (analogously to step 2), also charging C4 to 2Us. The output voltage (the sum of voltages of C2 and C4) rises until 4Us is reached.

Adding an additional stage will increase the output voltage by twice the peak AC source voltage (minus losses due to the diodes ‒ see the next paragraph).

In reality, more cycles are required for C4 to reach the full voltage, and the voltage of each capacitor is lowered by the forward voltage drop () of each diode on the path to that capacitor. For example, the voltage of C4 in the example would be at most since there are 4 diodes between its positive terminal and the source. The total output voltage would be . In a cascade with stages of two diodes and two capacitors, the output voltage is equal to . The term represents the sum of voltage losses caused by diodes, over all capacitors on the output side (i.e. on the right side in the example ‒ C2 and C4). For example if we have 2 stages like in the example, the total loss is times . An additional stage will increase the output voltage by twice the source voltage, minus the forward voltage drop over diodes: .

==Voltage doubler and tripler==
A voltage doubler uses two stages to approximately double the DC voltage that would have been obtained from a single-stage rectifier. An example of a voltage doubler is found in the input stage of switch mode power supplies containing a SPDT switch to select either 120 V or 240 V supply. In the 120 V position the input is typically configured as a full-wave voltage doubler by opening one AC connection point of a bridge rectifier, and connecting the input to the junction of two series-connected filter capacitors. For 240 V operation, the switch configures the system as a full-wave bridge, re-connecting the capacitor center-tap wire to the open AC terminal of a bridge rectifier system. This allows 120 or 240 V operation with the addition of a simple SPDT switch.

A voltage tripler is a three-stage voltage multiplier. A tripler is a popular type of voltage multiplier. The output voltage of a tripler is in practice below three times the peak input voltage due to their high impedance, caused in part by the fact that as each capacitor in the chain supplies power to the next, it partially discharges, losing voltage doing so.

Triplers were commonly used in color television receivers to provide the high voltage for the cathode-ray tube (CRT, picture tube). 

Triplers are still used in high voltage supplies such as copiers, laser printers, bug zappers and electroshock weapons.

== Breakdown voltage ==
While the multiplier can be used to produce thousands of volts of output, the individual components do not need to be rated to withstand the entire voltage range. Each component only needs to be concerned with the relative voltage differences directly across its own terminals and of the components immediately adjacent to it.

Typically a voltage multiplier will be physically arranged like a ladder, so that the progressively increasing voltage potential is not given the opportunity to arc across to the much lower potential sections of the circuit.

Note that some safety margin is needed across the relative range of voltage differences in the multiplier, so that the ladder can survive the shorted failure of at least one diode or capacitor component. Otherwise a single-point shorting failure could successively over-voltage and destroy each next component in the multiplier, potentially destroying the entire multiplier chain.

== Other circuit topologies ==
;Stacking: 

An even number of diode-capacitor cells is used in any column so that the cascade ends on a smoothing cell. If it were odd and ended on a clamping cell the ripple voltage would be very large. Larger capacitors in the connecting column also reduce ripple but at the expense of charging time and increased diode current.

===Dickson charge pump===

The Dickson charge pump, or Dickson multiplier, is a modification of the Greinacher/Cockcroft–Walton multiplier. There are, however, several important differences:
* The Dickson multiplier takes a &quot;DC supply&quot; as its input so is a form of DC-to-DC converter. In addition to the DC input, the circuit requires a feed of two clock pulse trains with an amplitude swinging between the DC supply rails. These pulse trains are in antiphase.
* The Dickson multiplier is intended for &quot;low-voltage applications&quot;, unlike Greinacher/Cockcroft–Walton which is commonly used in high-voltage applications. This is because the final capacitor has to hold the entire output voltage, whereas in the Greinacher/Cockcroft–Walton multiplier, each capacitor holds at most twice the input voltage (thus easily allowing multiplication by a factor of 10 or more). 

To describe the ideal operation of the circuit, number the diodes D1, D2 etc. from left to right and the capacitors C1, C2 etc. When the clock formula_1 is low, D1 will charge C1 to &quot;V&quot;in. When formula_1 goes high the top plate of C1 is pushed up to 2&quot;V&quot;in. D1 is then turned off and D2 turned on and C2 begins to charge to 2&quot;V&quot;in. On the next clock cycle formula_1 again goes low and now formula_4 goes high pushing the top plate of C2 to 3&quot;V&quot;in. D2 switches off and D3 switches on, charging C3 to 3&quot;V&quot;in and so on with charge passing up the chain, hence the name charge pump. The final diode-capacitor cell in the cascade is connected to ground rather than a clock phase and hence is not a multiplier; it is a peak detector which merely provides smoothing.

There are a number of factors which reduce the output from the ideal case of &quot;nV&quot;in. One of these is the threshold voltage, &quot;V&quot;T of the switching device, that is, the voltage required to turn it on. The output will be reduced by at least &quot;nV&quot;T due to the volt drops across the switches. Schottky diodes are commonly used in Dickson multipliers for their low forward voltage drop, amongst other reasons. Another difficulty is that there are parasitic capacitances to ground at each node. These parasitic capacitances act as voltage dividers with the circuit&#x27;s storage capacitors reducing the output voltage still further. Up to a point, a higher clock frequency is beneficial: the ripple is reduced and the high frequency makes the remaining ripple easier to filter. Also the size of capacitors needed is reduced since less charge needs to be stored per cycle. However, losses through stray capacitance increase with increasing clock frequency and a practical limit is around a few hundred kilohertz.

Dickson multipliers are frequently found in integrated circuits (ICs) where they are used to increase a low-voltage battery supply to the voltage needed by the IC. It is advantageous to the IC designer and manufacturer to be able to use the same technology and the same basic device throughout the IC. For this reason, in the popular CMOS technology ICs the transistor which forms the basic building block of circuits is the MOSFET. Consequently, the diodes in the Dickson multiplier are often replaced with MOSFETs wired to behave as diodes.

The diode-wired MOSFET version of the Dickson multiplier does not work very well at very low voltages because of the large drain-source volt drops of the MOSFETs. Frequently, a more complex circuit is used to overcome this problem. One solution is to connect in parallel with the switching MOSFET another MOSFET biased into its linear region. This second MOSFET has a lower drain-source voltage than the switching MOSFET would have on its own (because the switching MOSFET is driven hard on) and consequently the output voltage is increased. The gate of the linear biased MOSFET is connected to the output of the next stage so that it is turned off while the next stage is charging from the previous stage&#x27;s capacitor. That is, the linear-biased transistor is turned off at the same time as the switching transistor.

An ideal 4-stage Dickson multiplier (5× multiplier) with an input of would have an output of . However, a diode-wired MOSFET 4-stage multiplier might only have an output of . Adding parallel MOSFETs in the linear region improves this to around . More complex circuits still can achieve an output much closer to the ideal case.

Many other variations and improvements to the basic Dickson circuit exist. Some attempt to reduce the switching threshold voltage such as the Mandal-Sarpeshkar multiplier or the Wu multiplier. Other circuits cancel out the threshold voltage: the Umeda multiplier does it with an externally provided voltage and the Nakamoto multiplier does it with internally generated voltage. The Bergeret multiplier concentrates on maximising power efficiency.

====Modification for RF power====

In CMOS integrated circuits clock signals are readily available, or else easily generated. This is not always the case in RF integrated circuits, but often a source of RF power will be available. The standard Dickson multiplier circuit can be modified to meet this requirement by simply grounding the normal input and one of the clock inputs. RF power is injected into the other clock input, which then becomes the circuit input. The RF signal is effectively the clock as well as the source of power. However, since the clock is injected only into every other node the circuit only achieves a stage of multiplication for every second diode-capacitor cell. The other diode-capacitor cells are merely acting as peak detectors and smoothing the ripple without increasing the multiplication.

===Cross-coupled switched capacitor===

A voltage multiplier may be formed of a cascade of voltage doublers of the cross-coupled switched capacitor type. This type of circuit is typically used instead of a Dickson multiplier when the source voltage is or less. Dickson multipliers have increasingly poor power conversion efficiency as the input voltage drops because the voltage drop across the diode-wired transistors becomes much more significant compared to the output voltage. Since the transistors in the cross-coupled circuit are not diode-wired the volt-drop problem is not so serious.

The circuit works by alternately switching the output of each stage between a voltage doubler driven by formula_1 and one driven by formula_4. This behaviour leads to another advantage over the Dickson multiplier: reduced ripple voltage at double the frequency. The increase in ripple frequency is advantageous because it is easier to remove by filtering. Each stage (in an ideal circuit) raises the output voltage by the peak clock voltage. Assuming that this is the same level as the DC input voltage then an &quot;n&quot; stage multiplier will (ideally) output &quot;nV&quot;in. The chief cause of losses in the cross-coupled circuit is parasitic capacitance rather than switching threshold voltage. The losses occur because some of the energy has to go into charging up the parasitic capacitances on each cycle.

== Applications ==

The high-voltage supplies for cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) in TVs often use voltage multipliers with the final-stage smoothing capacitor formed by the interior and exterior aquadag coatings on the CRT itself. CRTs were formerly a common component in television sets. Voltage multipliers can still be found in modern TVs, photocopiers, and bug zappers.

High voltage multipliers are used in spray painting equipment, most commonly found in automotive manufacturing facilities. A voltage multiplier with an output of about 100kV is used in the nozzle of the paint sprayer to electrically charge the atomized paint particles which then get attracted to the oppositely charged metal surfaces to be painted. This helps reduce the volume of paint used and helps in spreading an even coat of paint.

A common type of voltage multiplier used in high-energy physics is the Cockcroft–Walton generator (which was designed by John Douglas Cockcroft and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton for a particle accelerator for use in research that won them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951).

<doc id="799522" wikidata="Q437948" url="?curid=799522" title="Sabrina Lloyd">
<text>Sabrina Lloyd (born November 20, 1970) is a retired American film and television actress. She is known for portraying Wade Welles in the science fiction series &quot;Sliders&quot;, Natalie Hurley in the ABC sitcom &quot;Sports Night&quot; and Kelly in &quot;Father Hood&quot; (1993).

==Early life==
Sabrina Lloyd is the daughter of Judy Lloyd, who managed a title insurance company in Lake Mary, Florida. At age 12, she began her acting career in the role of Pepper in a Mount Dora production of &quot;Annie&quot;.

When she was in the 10th grade she participated in a student exchange program that allowed her to spend a year in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. She graduated from Lake Mary High School in 1989.

==Career==
Lloyd moved to New York when she was 18 to pursue a film career. Her earliest work there was in industrial training films and TV commercials, including one for Eastpak backpacks. She made a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; called &quot;Intolerance&quot;. She signed with a new talent agent and started getting more roles in TV and film.

Her first important role in feature films was in &quot;Chain of Desire&quot;, and this was followed by her first starring role in &quot;Father Hood&quot; with Patrick Swayze. She appeared in the 1993 music video for the song &quot;Iris&quot; by The Breeders. Lloyd also made appearances on television, starring in the TV movies &quot;The Coming Out of Heidi Leiter&quot;, an episode of &quot;&quot; and &quot;Love Off Limits&quot;.

In 1995, Lloyd played Wade Welles, one of the original four characters in the sci-fi TV show &quot;Sliders&quot;. In 1997, the show was picked up by the Sci Fi Channel, but Lloyd&#x27;s contract was not renewed. She quickly landed a co-starring role as senior associate producer Natalie Hurley in the ABC sitcom &quot;Sports Night&quot;.

In 2005, she starred as Terry Lake on the television show &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, but she left after the first season. Her contract had an option to leave after the first season, and she chose to do so. Lloyd wanted to return to New York. In 2008, Lloyd was the lead actress in the independent film &quot;Universal Signs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Outside of her acting career, she is an artist and has explored various media such as writing, painting and pottery. She has two cats named Lucy and Theodore and was a vegetarian for six years during the 1990s. In 2010, Lloyd studied creative writing at Columbia University.

In April 1997, Lloyd married Ross Smith. They lived in Uganda for two years (2009–2010), and adopted a little girl while living there. They moved to Italy and lived in Rome for four years, where they had a son, and subsequently relocated to Vancouver Island. Lloyd is retired from acting.

<doc id="799523" wikidata="Q3278853" url="?curid=799523" title="Yibbum">
<text>Yibbum (, ) is the form of levirate marriage found in Judaism. As specified by , the brother of a man who died without children is permitted and encouraged to marry the widow. However, if either of the parties refuses to go through with the marriage, both are required to go through a ceremony known as &quot;halizah&quot;, involving a symbolic act of renunciation of their right to perform this marriage.

Jewish law (&quot;halakha&quot;) has seen a gradual decline of &quot;yibbum&quot; in favor of &quot;halizah&quot;, to the point where in most contemporary Jewish communities, and in Israel by mandate of the Chief Rabbinate, &quot;yibbum&quot; is prohibited.

==In the Hebrew Bible==

The Torah prohibits sexual relations by a man with his brother&#x27;s wife, but &quot;yibbum&quot; is an exception to this rule. The surviving brother is given a choice to take his responsibility as a goel by fulfilling the yibbum obligation, or to perform &quot;halizah&quot;, though the latter choice is described by the verse disfavorably. The brother who agreed to marry his sister-in-law would be the sole benefactor of his brother&#x27;s estate instead of splitting it with the family. The offspring of the levirate union would be seen as a perpetuation of the deceased brother&#x27;s name. &quot;Yibbum&quot; is permissible only when the dead brother had no children at all.

Although the stated intent of the levirate law as expressed in Deuteronomy is to provide an heir so that the deceased brother&#x27;s name &quot;will not be obliterated from Israel&quot; (), such laws effectively provided protection for widows as well. At the time the Torah was written, if a woman did not have a husband because of widowhood, she had no one to provide for her any longer and she would be disgraced, if not likely die of starvation. Children were also a means of continued provision, since they are commanded to care and show respect for the elderly as they move further along in years. A childless widow was without both means of provision. Under Torah, men had a responsibility to the women around them, which included life-sustaining provisions (i.e. food, shelter, and comfort). Those of honor were beholden to their responsibility to protect the defenseless.

Yibbum had significant economic implications for the parties involved: the first child born to the brother&#x27;s widow would be deemed the heir of the deceased brother, and able to claim the deceased brother&#x27;s share of inheritance. If the deceased brother was the firstborn son, his inheritance was a double share. However, if the deceased brother were childless, the living brother would be entitled to inherit an increased share; or if he is the oldest surviving son he would be entitled to a double share of the increased share.

===Levirate-type marriages other than yibbum===
A detailed account of a levirate-type marriage in the Hebrew Bible is the unusual union of Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar found in . The case is not strictly a case of &quot;yibbum&quot; as Judah was Tamar&#x27;s father-in-law, and also the case pre-dates the biblical obligation. It may be a reflection of contemporaneous Middle East practices. Tamar&#x27;s earlier marriage to Onan, however, did conform with the specific circumstances describing the requirements of &quot;yibbum&quot; outlined in &quot;Deuteronomy&quot;, as Onan was the brother of Tamar&#x27;s deceased husband Er.

Another example of an analogous arrangement to &quot;yibbum&quot; is recounted in the &quot;Book of Ruth&quot;. After the death of her husband, Ruth is noticed and welcomed by her husband&#x27;s kinsman, Boaz. After Ruth is rejected by an anonymous &quot;Ploni Almoni&quot;, Boaz marries her. In this case as well, the kin in question would not have been subject to the biblical levirate marriage obligation, as neither Ploni Almoni nor Boaz were brothers of Ruth&#x27;s late husband.

==Laws of &quot;yibbum&quot; and &quot;halizah&quot;==

&quot;Halakha&quot; (Jewish law) has a rich tradition around &quot;yibbum&quot;. These laws were first recorded in the Mishna and Talmud in Yevamot, and were later codified by Maimonides in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. The subject is considered one of the most intricate in Jewish law, partly because of the complication that arise from multiple brothers and multiple wives. &quot;Yibbum&quot; is an exception to the biblical prohibition for a man to have sexual relations with &quot;his brother&#x27;s wife&quot; found for example in and . (See Incest in the Bible.)

===When &quot;yibbum&quot; applies===
The obligation for &quot;yibbum&quot; is found at , which requires that when a married man dies without having any children, male or female, from any relationship (including pre-marital and extra-marital), his widow and his brother must perform either &quot;yibbum&quot; or &quot;halizah&quot;. For the laws of &quot;yibbum&quot; only brothers that share a common father are considered brothers. In the event of several brothers in the family, the eldest surviving brother has the first right of &quot;yibbum&quot;. In order for &quot;yibbum&quot; to apply, all of the following conditions must be met:
# The brothers share a common father 
# The dead brother had no surviving children, male or female, from any relationship, at the time of his death 
# The brother performing &quot;yibbum&quot; was born before his brother&#x27;s death 
# The brother performing &quot;yibbum&quot; is not forbidden, other than by her marriage to the dead brother, to marry &quot;any&quot; of his dead brother&#x27;s widows (e.g. if any of them is his daughter, &quot;yibbum&quot; does not apply to him at all)(and in the Talmudic discussion of such a case the other wives are referred to as &quot;tzarat habat&quot;, the &quot;daughter&#x27;s rival&quot;)
# The brother performing &quot;yibbum&quot; is physically capable of fathering children
# The widow is or was physically capable of bearing children
Even if some of the brothers do not meet all the conditions to be eligible for &quot;yibbum&quot;, as long as there is one that does, &quot;yibbum&quot; applies to him. If there is no brother who meets all of the conditions, neither &quot;yibbum&quot; nor &quot;halizah&quot; applies, except if the widow is forbidden to marry the brother as a result of a prohibition not involving the punishment of kareth (spiritual excision), in which case &quot;halitzah&quot; would apply.

===Restrictions related to &quot;yibbum&quot;===
It is forbidden for any of the widows to remarry until &quot;yibbum&quot; or &quot;halizah&quot; has been performed. If the deceased left multiple wives &quot;yibbum&quot; may only be performed with one of them, at which time the remaining wives are permitted to remarry. Likewise, if &quot;yibbum&quot; is not performed, &quot;halizah&quot; is only performed with one of the widows, after which all of them may remarry.

If all surviving brothers are still children, the widow must wait until one reaches halachic adulthood, at which time he can perform yibbum or &quot;halizah&quot;. Similarly, if the brother is missing, the woman is required to wait until he is located. This can lead to a situation similar to an &quot;agunah&quot;.

===How &quot;yibbum&quot; is performed===
According to biblical law, there is no need for a marriage ceremony between the widow and the deceased&#x27;s brother as they are already bound by divine decree, thus, they need only cohabit to perform &quot;yibbum&quot;. Nevertheless, the Sages decreed that the couple perform a marriage-like ceremony called &quot;maamar&quot;, recite the marriage blessings (&quot;sheva brachot&quot;) and write a prenuptial agreement (&quot;ketubah&quot;).

Only one brother may perform &quot;yibbum&quot;. The oldest brother is given preference, but if he refuses, the brother who is second in line can perform &quot;yibbum&quot;, and if a brother performed &quot;yibbum&quot; out of turn, it is nevertheless valid. After one brother performs &quot;yibbum&quot; or &quot;halizah&quot;, none of the brothers may marry any of the other widows.

===Other laws===

Because there is a general prohibition on a man marrying his brother&#x27;s wife, anytime that a &quot;yibbum&quot; is not required (for example, the deceased had a child), levirate marriage is forbidden. Likewise, anytime that there is a doubt whether &quot;yibbum&quot; is required, it is also forbidden and &quot;halizah&quot; is required.

The Samaritans followed a slightly different course, which may indicate an earlier custom; they practised &quot;yibbum&quot; only when the woman was betrothed and the marriage had not been consummated. Karaite Judaism appear to have followed the same practice, and Benjamin Nahawandi as well as Elijah Bashyazi favored it.

==History==
The rabbis in the time of the &quot;mishnah&quot; added formal marriage requirements, such as the necessity of betrothing the deceased brother&#x27;s wife in front of two competent witnesses by giving to her money or an object having certain money value, and of writing out a &quot;ketubah&quot; (marriage contract), but over the centuries the performance of levirate marriage (&quot;yibbum&quot;) declined in favor of &quot;halizah&quot; (the act of refusal).

By Talmudic times the practice of levirate marriage was deemed secondary in preference to &quot;halizah&quot; by some of the rabbis, because of the brother&#x27;s questionable intentions; indeed, to marry a brother&#x27;s widow for her beauty was regarded by Abba Saul as equivalent to incest. Bar Kappara also recommends &quot;halizah&quot;. A difference of opinion appears among the later authorities, with Isaac Alfasi, Maimonides, and the Spanish school generally upholding the custom, while Rabbeinu Tam and the Northern school prefer &quot;halizah.&quot; A change of religion on the part of the surviving brother does not affect the obligation of the levirate, or its alternative, the &quot;halizah&quot;. Additionally, if the surviving brother is married, Ashkenazim, who follow the &quot;takkanah&quot; of Gershom ben Judah abolishing polygamy, would be compelled to perform halizah.

Today, &quot;yibbum&quot; is a rare occurrence among Jewish communities, most claiming that if the intent is not purely for the sake of pro-creation, the act would thereby become marred and tantamount to an act of whoredom. Therefore, it was made virtually non-existent with other communities. Orthodox Jews in modern times have generally upheld the position of Rabbeinu Tam and perform &quot;halizah&quot; rather than &quot;yibbum&quot;. Yemenite Jews, though orthodox, practised &quot;yibbum&quot; until the &quot;en masse&quot; Aliyah of Jews to Eretz Israel in the last century. In 1950, the Rabbinate of Israel, along with the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, forbade its practice amongst the Yemenites, citing a need for &quot;uniformity amongst the Jewish groups,&quot; and only permitted those who were already married through levirate marriage from outside the country. Conservative Judaism formally retains it. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism have abolished it.

==Social consequences==
The rules may create social problems in some situations, especially for the widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the &quot;yibbum&quot; obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need to wait until the brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. In either event the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother&#x27;s intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Yibbum&quot; forms the plot of the Hallmark movie &quot;Loving Leah&quot;.

<doc id="799533" wikidata="Q4127773" url="?curid=799533" title="All Summer in a Day">
<text>&quot;All Summer in a Day&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Ray Bradbury, first published in March 1954 for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;.

== Plot synopsis ==
The story is about a class of students on Venus, which, in this story, is a world of constant rainstorms, where the sun is only visible for an hour every seven years. The kids are all nine years old.

One of the children, Margot, moved to Venus from Earth five years earlier and is the only one who remembers the sun, since it shines regularly on Earth. She describes the sun to the other children as being like a &quot;penny&quot; or &quot;fire in the stove&quot;. The other children, being too young to have ever seen it themselves, do not believe her. Just before the sun comes out, a boy named William rallies the other children, and they lock Margot in a closet down a tunnel.

The teacher arrives to take the class outside to enjoy their hour of sunshine while Margot is banging on the door. In their astonishment and joy, they all forget about Margot and gleefully rush to play outside, savoring every second of their newfound freedom. 

Soon after, it begins to rain again, and the children start crying once they realize they will not get to see the sun again for another seven years. The children run back inside as the sun quickly disappears and it starts storming. At this point, one of them remembers Margot. They let her out of the closet, ashamed over what they have done, now that they finally understand what she had been missing.

==Adaptations==
A 30-minute television adaptation was created, originally broadcast on the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;WonderWorks&quot; in 1982. The adaptation differs from the story in that the sun only appears every nine years, and the ending is expanded: the children atone for their horrible act by giving Margot flowers they picked while the Sun was out. The director of photography was Robert Elswit, who went on to become an Academy Award winning cinematographer.

===Short film cast===

<doc id="799537" wikidata="Q659450" url="?curid=799537" title="Santarém, Pará">
<text>Santarém () is a town and municipality in the western part of the state of Pará in Brazil. Located at the confluence of the Tapajós and Amazon Rivers, it has become a popular tourist destination. It is the second-most important city in the state, and the financial and economic center of the western part of the state. It leads the Santarém Metropolitan Area, made up of Santarém, Belterra and Mojuí dos Campos. It was once home to the Tapajós Indians, a tribe of Native Americans after whom the river was named. They were the leaders of a large, agricultural chiefdom that flourished before the arrival of Europeans.

It is located some 600-700 km from the two largest cities in the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, upriver in the state of Amazonas, and the Pará state capital Belém, located downriver at the mouth of the Amazon on the Atlantic Ocean. Santarém has an estimated population of 306,480 people (2020), and is the third most populous city of the state. The city occupies an area of , of which 77 km2 are urban areas.

The city was founded by Portuguese colonists in 1661 as New, it was discovered by Priest João Filipe Bettendorff Santarém (after the city in Portugal). It is one of the oldest cities in the Brazilian Amazon. This is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santarém.

Because of the crystalline waters of the Tapajós River, Santarém has more than 100 km (62 mi) of natural beaches, such as those of the village of Alter do Chão, known as the &quot;Caribbean in Brazil.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked this beach as the most beautiful in Brazil. Alter do Chão is also home to &quot;Sairé,&quot; one of the most important folklore festivals of the region, which is held annually in September.

Some political activists have lobbied to create a new Brazilian state by dividing the enormous state of Pará into western and eastern regions. The new state to be established in the west would be called the Tapajós, with Santarém serving as the capital.

== History ==
The first written references to the Tapajós Indian settlement in the area date back to 1542, when Francisco Orellana sacked one of their corn plantations.

In 1621, ten years after the founding of Belém at the mouth of the Amazon River, the Portuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira, along with Father Cristovão, 26 soldiers and many Indians, set off to explore the upper reaches of the Amazon. They eventually found a Tupuliçus Indian settlement near the mouth of the Tapajós River and made port there. The Indians had already had contact with Europeans, mainly Spanish explorers who had been to the settlement. The Portuguese and Tupuliçus started trading.

Pedro Teixeira resumed his exploration. The Jesuits took on the work of founding a village for missionary purposes on the site, where Father António Vieira was known to have visited in 1659. Santarém was founded by Father João Filipe Bettendorff on 22 June 1661 with the name &quot;Aldeia do Tapajós&quot; (Tapajós village). Father Bettendorff built the Chapel of Our Lady of Conception. The site where the first mass was celebrated in the city is now marked by a monument. The Jesuits founded other villages nearby, including the Village of Borsari, known today as the Village of Alter do Chão, Pará.

After development from the missionaries, Francisco da Mota Falcão started construction of a fortress by the river in 1693, which was finished by his son, Manoel Mota Siqueira in 1697. The building had a square shape and featured bastions on each corner. The Fortress of Tapajós was the nucleus of the village that developed as the city of Santarém.

In 1758, the village of Tapajós was given the status of Vila and the name of Santarém, after a Portuguese city with the same name, and later was elevated to the category of city on October 24, 1848, by provincial law nº 145.

Over the centuries, the government tried to renovate the fortress were made, the last being in 1867, when the government sent six cannons to arm it. The renovation was never finished and the cannons were left in the street. Today not much remains of the fortress, as materials were taken for other building projects.

In 1900 a high school was built on the site. Early in the first decade of the 21st century, &quot;Praça Mirante do the Tapajós&quot;, a tourist attraction, was built behind the school. Two of the cannons from the fortress have been installed at the city&#x27;s airport, where they can be seen from the passenger terminal; two others are located in the Centenário Square, and two in the SUDAM Campus of the Federal University of Western Pará (UFOPA)

== Geography ==

Santarém is bordered by the Amazon and the Tapajós rivers. Both run along many kilometers in the front of the city, side by side, without mixing. Amazon&#x27;s milky colored water carries sediment from the Andes in the East, while the Tapajós&#x27;s water is somewhat warmer and has a deep-blue tone. This phenomenon is called &quot;The meeting of the waters&quot; by the locals.

=== Climate ===
Santarém has a tropical monsoon climate not subject to significant changes in temperatures due to its proximity to the equator. The average annual temperature varies between 25º and , with a relative humidity of 86%. During the year the average rainfall is of about , which becomes more intense during the wet season that spans from November to July when the average monthly rainfall varies from . The dry season spans from August through October, in this season the lowest rainfall is recorded which troughs at .
== Demographics ==
 
The total population of the city was 294,580 people (2010 census). Santarém is the seventh-largest city in the north region of Brazil, behind Manaus, Belém, Porto Velho, Ananindeua, Macapá and Rio Branco. Of the population 51.5% were men and 48.5% women.
Santarém lost population from 1996 to 1999, during the decline of the gold rush in the latter part of the decade of 1980. Moreover, between 1980 and 2000, the rural population declined as people moved into cities due to poor infrastructure in the countryside.

Since the year 2000, Santarém&#x27;s population has increased due to that migration, as well as people being attracted to its improved infrastructure, health care, schools, and other amenities. In 2008, the village of Mojui dos Campos was designated as an independent City, so its population was withdrawn from the Santarém total.

=== Religion ===
Santarém was founded by the Portuguese as a Catholic city and the vast majority of the population is catholic. New migrants have brought differing religions, including various Protestant denominations, Judaism, Spiritualism, and Buddhism.

=== Economy ===
Santarém is an important regional market center in the Lower Amazon, located midway between the larger cities of Belém at the coast and Manaus upriver. The regional economy is based on agriculture, cattle, and mining. The city has seen many &#x27;cycles&#x27; of development dominated by one or a few economic activities, including rubber extraction (in the last century), coffee production, and gold mining. Most recently, there has been a huge growth in the area of soybean plantations.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Airport ===
Santarém is home to Santarém-Maestro Wilson Fonseca Airport. As it is located between two of the most important airports in the region, it is an alternative for international flights. Situated 15  km from downtown, the airport can be reached by car or bus in about 20 minutes via Fernando Guilhon Highway. The airport was opened in 1977 by the Brazilian Air Force; in 1980 it was transferred to Infraero, a government agency responsible for operating the major Brazilian airports.

The airport handles traffic from six airlines connecting Santarém to the country and the world. As of September 2012, the airport was undergoing renovation and expansion of the Passenger Terminal Building and Parking lot to accommodate increased passenger traffic.

=== Highways ===

BR-163 connects Santarém with southern Brazil. A large portion of it is not paved which renders the highway nearly unusable during the wet season. BR-230 connects BR-163 to the state capital.

=== Fluvial ===
The rivers and waterways are still the central means of transporting passenger and cargo due to the poor conditions of the highways and the high price of airplane travel. Santarém is a popular destination for cruise ships on the Amazon, which make Port of Santarém regularly in the City Docks. The docks are administrated by the CDP (Companhia Docas do Pará) and are the second most important in the state, second only to Belém, due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.

Most nearby villages have no roads and can only be reached by boat; trips can take up to 12 hours depending on the boat and the destination.

The Cargill Port is a private port near the Docks. It exports soybean and has capacity for storing 60,000 tons of soy. There is also a makeshift port near Tiradentes Square administered by the city, where small and medium-sized boats dock. As of 2012 a new Fluvial Terminal was under construction to replace the existing one.

=== Public Transportation ===
The Public Transportation System is made of: Urban bus service, Suburban bus service, Personal automobile transportation service (Taxi), Personal motorcycle transportation service (known as MotoTaxi), and School transportation service.

The public transportation services are administered by the Municipal Transportation Department, which plans and promotes traffic development. Traffic safety is administered by several governmental agencies such as the Transit Police branch of the State Police (PTRAN), the Brazilian Highway Police based in Santarém, the DMV, and the transportation department through its fiscal management and guards.

=== Education ===

Santarém has 457 municipal schools accommodating 62,121 students, 44 state primary and high schools, 44 particular schools and twelve universities

The city museum, Centro Cultural João Fona (João Fona Cultural Center), is available to visitors free of charge. It is located in an 1853 building used before in its history as a City Hall, Municipal Courthouse and jail.

One school, Escola Estadual do 1o Grau Richard Henington, has 13 classrooms in three parts. It is named after a United States-born Brazilian, Richard Henington (born May 19, 1830), who originated in Crystal Springs, Mississippi and immigrated to Brazil in 1867, arriving on August 16, 1868, and settling in Santarém.

=== Health ===
The city administers the Municipal Hospital. As of September 2012, it maintains 35 rural health care posts, and 50 health care centers in the urban area, six of which operate 24 hours a day. SAMU is also based in the city; it rescues victims of all kinds of accidents, working many times together with the State Fire Department. In 2012 a hospital was built to treat people rescued by SAMU and the Fire Department. The State Regional Hospital is located in the city, receiving and treating patients from all the cities in the west of Pará.

=== Communications ===
Santarém has WiFi internet service providers. As of 2013, DSL is not yet available, and private internet connection is slow and expensive. The city maintains several WiFi hotspots in most squares, monuments, and tourist attractions. City residents support many newspapers, TV stations, and radio stations.

Radio amateurs maintain a VHF repeater operating on 146.950  MHz that can reach more than 100  km, covering the village of Alter do Chão and the cities of Belterra, Mojui dos Campos, Óbidos and Oriximiná.

==Controversy around Cargill soybean port==
In 2003, the US-based corporation Cargill completed a port facility for processing soybean in Santarém. The port has dramatically stimulated soybean production in the area due to improving the transport of the commodity crop. Although the company complied with state legislation, it failed to comply with a federal law requiring an Environmental Impact Statement. Instead, Cargill contested in court its need to comply. In late 2003 Greenpeace launched a campaign claiming the new port has increased deforestation of local rain forest, damaging the regional habitat, as farmers have cleared land to make way for soy crops.

In February 2006, the federal courts in Brazil gave Cargill six months to complete the environmental assessment. This ruling came as part of a broader popular backlash against the port; while it was initially supported by locals who hoped for jobs, opinion has turned against it as the jobs have not appeared. In July 2006, federal prosecutor Felícia Pontes Jr. suggested that the government was close to shutting down the port.

Cargill responded to criticisms of the port by emphasizing its contribution to encouraging economic development in the local province, one of the poorest in Brazil. It says that &quot;extreme measures,&quot; such as closing the port, are not necessary because &quot;Soybean occupies less than 0.6 percent of the land in the Amazon biome today.&quot; Cargill also points to its partnership with The Nature Conservancy to encourage farmers around Santarém to comply with Brazilian law that requires 80% of forest cover to be left intact in Amazon forest areas while the land is being cultivated.

<doc id="799541" wikidata="Q5254978" url="?curid=799541" title="Mint (candy)">
<text>A mint or breath mint is a food item often consumed as an after-meal refreshment or before business and social engagements to improve breath odor. Mints are commonly believed to soothe the stomach given their association with natural byproducts of the plant genus &quot;Mentha&quot;. Mints sometimes contain derivatives from plants such as peppermint oil or spearmint oil, or wintergreen from the plant genus &quot;Gaultheria&quot;. However, many of the most popular mints citing these natural sources contain none in their ingredient list or contain only trace amounts.

==History==

The production of mints as a discrete food item can be traced back to the 18th century with the invention of Altoids. The popularity of mints took off in the early 20th century, with the advent of mass urbanization and mass marketing. Advertising for mints focused on their convenience, and on the socially isolating effects of bad breath. These advertisements targeted young people generally, and young women particularly.

Mints have been offered in a variety of packaging, usually in an effort to promote portability. Early producers used cardboard boxes and tins, which have remained popular. More recent packaging solutions have included &quot;rolls&quot; containing many mints stacked in one package composed of paper or foil, plastic boxes, and individually wrapped mints. Mint sales have remained robust in the 21st century.

==Types==

===Hard===

Hard mints are hard candies or boiled sweets flavored with mint. Examples of hard mints include starlight mints, also known as pinwheel mints, white, circular, with red or green rays emitting from the middle; candy canes; humbugs; and brand name mints such as Altoids and Ice Breakers. Branded breath mints are produced in flavors other than mint.

===Soft===

Soft mints, such as &quot;dinner mints&quot; and &quot;butter mints&quot;, are soft candies, often with a higher butter content, that dissolve more readily inside one&#x27;s mouth.

===Scotch===
A &quot;scotch mint&quot;, &quot;pan drop&quot;, granny sooker or &quot;mint imperial&quot; is a white round candy with a hard shell but fairly soft middle, popular in Great Britain and other Commonwealth nations and in Europe. Scotch mints were traditionally spheroids, more recently moving toward a larger, discoid shape. Various forms of mint may be used but those termed &quot;scotch mints&quot; are named for the specific mint plant &quot;Mentha × gracilis&quot;.

== Use ==
In addition to breath freshening, mints that actually contain peppermint oil or extract have been popular in helping with digestion after a meal. Peppermint has muscle relaxant properties and therefore may relax the smooth muscles of the GI tract, allowing for easier passage of food contents. However, since the lower esophageal sphincter may be relaxed, peppermint may aggravate &quot;heartburn&quot; or GERD.

Peppermint also seems to be effective in relieving intestinal gas and indigestion. According to the German Commission E Monograph, real peppermint oil or extract has been used for cramp-like complaints in the gastrointestinal tract. This can help to explain why mints with real peppermint oil, in addition to peppermint tea, have been popular for and are frequently used after meals to help with digestion as well as to help freshen the breath.

<doc id="799542" wikidata="Q7058330" url="?curid=799542" title="2004 North East England devolution referendum">
<text>The 2004 North East England devolution referendum was an all postal ballot referendum that took place on 4 November 2004 throughout North East England on whether or not to establish an elected assembly for the region. Devolution referendums in the regions of Northern England were initially proposed under provisions of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003. Initially, three referendums were planned, but only one took place. The votes concerned the question of devolving limited political powers from the UK Parliament to elected regional assemblies in North East England, North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber respectively. Each were initially planned to be held on 4 November 2004, but on 22 July 2004 the planned referendums in North West England and in Yorkshire and the Humber were postponed, due to concerns raised about the use of postal ballots, but the referendum in North East England was allowed to continue, particularly as it was assumed that the region held the most support for the proposed devolution.

On 4 November 2004, voters in the North East rejected the proposal, in an all-postal ballot, by 77.9% to 22.1%, on a turnout of 48%. Every council area in the region had a majority for &quot;no&quot;. The referendum was held in what was at the time arguably Labour&#x27;s strongest region within the United Kingdom which included at the time the then Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s own constituency in Sedgefield. The defeat marked the end of the Labour Government&#x27;s policy of devolution for England, and the other proposed referendums for the North West and for Yorkshire and the Humber were dropped indefinitely. This would also be the last major devolution referendum to be held in any part of the United Kingdom under the Labour Government of 1997–2010.

The campaign against the proposed Assembly was successfully led by local businessman John Elliott, who argued that the institution would have no real powers and that it would be a &quot;white elephant&quot; and too centric to Newcastle upon Tyne.

It was the first major referendum to be held in any part of the United Kingdom which was conducted and overseen by the Electoral Commission after its establishment in 2000 under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

==Background==
The Labour government attempted to introduce directly elected English regional assemblies. The London Assembly was the first of these, established following a referendum in 1998, in which public and media attention was focused principally on the post of Mayor of London.

==Assembly proposals==

Voters were asked whether they wanted an elected regional assembly to be created for their region. The structure and powers of elected regional assemblies was outlined in a Draft Regional Assemblies Bill presented to Parliament by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in July 2004.

The draft bill proposed the following structure:
* The assembly would be a body corporate with a distinct legal identity.
* Each assembly would be composed of between 25 and 35 assembly members elected by the additional member system.
* The assembly would select one member as the chairman and another as deputy chairman to preside over its debates.
* The assembly would have an Executive (cabinet) composed of a Leader and between two and six Executive Members.

The draft bill would have given the assemblies the following powers:
* Promotion of economic development
* Promotion of social development
** Promote health, safety and security
** Reduce health inequalities
** Enhance individual participation in society
** Improve the availability of good housing
** Improve skills and the availability of training
** Improve the availability of cultural and recreational activities
* Improvement and protection of the environment
* Additional functions and duties that the Secretary of State thinks appropriate

==Local government reorganisation==
The creation of regional assemblies was to be tied to abolition of the existing two-tier structure for local government in these regions; and its replacement with a uniform system of unitary authorities. In areas that had two-tier government (Cheshire, County Durham, Cumbria, Lancashire, North Yorkshire, Northumberland), voters were to be asked which pattern of unitary government they would like to see.

Two options were proposed by the Boundary Committee for each county in the review area – generally consisting of a single unitary authority for the entire county, or a break-up into smaller authorities which are larger than the existing districts. It was recommended that ceremonial counties be left untouched in most cases. This recommendation was broadly (with one minor alteration in West Lancashire) accepted by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Voting was to take place on a per-county council-area basis, except that the Cumbria and Lancashire votes would have been run as one – since it would be impossible to have option 1 in one and option 2 in another.

Any changes as a result of the North East referendum would probably have come into effect on 1 April 2006 – to give time for preparation, and taking into account 1 April as the traditional day of local government reform in the UK.

In Lancashire and Cumbria the proposals for multiple unitary authorities were very similar to those proposed by the Redcliffe-Maud Report in 1969. This proposed authorities for North Cumbria based in Carlisle, and one for Morecambe Bay covering Barrow-in-Furness and Lancaster for the north of the region. In central Lancashire there were to be divided into four authorities based on Blackpool, Preston, Blackburn and Burnley. The area of West Lancashire was to be given to Merseyside and included with Southport in a district.

The options were as follows for North East England:

===North East England===

====County Durham====
====Northumberland====
==Referendum questions==
All voters in the North East England region were asked to vote on the question of whether or not there should be an elected Assembly. Voters in County Durham and Northumberland were asked to vote on an additional second question on proposals for local government reorganisation in the event of a &quot;yes&quot; vote.

===Assembly referendum question===
The question that appeared on ballot papers was:

permitting a simple YES / NO answer (to be marked with a single (X)).

===Local Government reorganisation referendum question===
The question that appeared on ballot papers in County Durham and Northumberland was:
with the responses to the question to be (to be marked with a single (X)):
==Results==
On 4 November 2004, in a turnout of almost 48% in an all postal ballot, voters in the North East decisively rejected the proposed regional assembly. The reasons for this result are varied; however, it is felt that the regional power would have been concentrated in an Assembly situated in Newcastle upon Tyne, which given the strong historic rivalries between urban centres in the North-East may have caused resentment from the people of Sunderland and Middlesbrough. Notwithstanding this, in the Newcastle upon Tyne local council area itself the majority of votes cast were against the proposal. It was also felt that not enough of a case had been put forward for the necessity of the Assembly, and it was feared that it would add another layer of politicians and public servants, thereby increasing taxes for the citizens of the areas affected.

===Assembly question result===
The referendum result was declared at 00:52 GMT on Friday 5 November 2004 at Crowtree Leisure Centre in Sunderland by the Chief Counting Officer for the North East region Ged Fitzgerald, who was also then Chief Executive of Sunderland City Council.


===Results by local council areas===
&quot;*&quot; Valid and rejected votes divided by electorate.

===Local government reorganisation question result===

The related votes in Northumberland and County Durham on local government changes became moot, though new single merged unitary authorities were later established based on the county council areas (i.e. Option A in each case) as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The votes had been:
&quot;*&quot; Valid and rejected votes divided by electorate.

==Planned referendums in North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber==

Similar referendums had been planned in North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber. These were postponed on 22 July due to issues with all-postal ballots – there were many allegations of fraud and procedural irregularities. Following the rejection of the proposal in the north east of England the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the time, ruled out holding further referendums in other regions for the foreseeable future.

===North West England===
These were the proposals for local government reorganisation in Northwest England. After the result in North East England the planned referendum for the region was postponed indefinitely and was never put before the electorate.

====Cheshire====
====Cumbria====
====Lancashire====
===Yorkshire and the Humber===
These were the proposals for local government reorganisation in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. After the result in North East England the planned referendum was postponed indefinitely and was also never put before the electorate.

====North Yorkshire====

<doc id="799543" wikidata="Q1070296" url="?curid=799543" title="Corel Painter">
<text>Corel Painter is a raster-based digital art application created to simulate as accurately as possible the appearance and behavior of traditional media associated with drawing, painting, and printmaking. It is intended to be used in real-time by professional digital artists as a functional creative tool.

==Materials and tools==
The application offers a wide range of traditional artists&#x27; materials and tools. With the aid of a graphics tablet or computer mouse, the user is able to reproduce the effect of physical painting and drawing media such as watercolor, oil, chalk, charcoal and color pencil. There are also a few non-traditional items, such as the Image Hose, pattern pens, F/X, Distortion and Artist tools for allowing artists to apply less conventional elements on an image.

Painter emulates the visual characteristics of traditional media, such as oil paint, pastel sticks, air brush, charcoal, felt pens, and other traditional artists&#x27; materials on various textured surfaces. Many of these emulated media types work with the advanced features of Wacom tablets. For instance, the airbrush tool in Painter responds to pressure as well as tilt, velocity and rotation.

Painter and Photoshop have many similarities, such as layered editing. The two products have developed as contemporaries, introducing innovations that are now considered standard in bitmap image editing software. For example, &quot;Floaters&quot; were released with Painter 2.5, around the time that Photoshop released &quot;composite elements&quot;. Over time, Painter&#x27;s user interface(UI) has been transformed to match Photoshop&#x27;s UI. 

==History==
Painter was initially published in 1991 for the Macintosh system by Mark Zimmer and Tom Hedges, founders of the Fractal Design Corporation. Zimmer and Hedges had previously developed ImageStudio and ColorStudio, both image-editing applications, for Letraset. John Derry joined Zimmer and Hedges during the release cycle of Painter 1.2. Derry had gained previous paint software expertise at Time Arts, a developer of the early desktop-based paint applications Lumena and Oasis. &quot;Fractal Design&quot; later merged with RayDream, then with MetaTools to become MetaCreations. Metacreations sold off all their creative interests and Painter was acquired by Corel Corporation where it was temporarily rebranded &quot;Procreate&quot; Painter during its transition into the Corel Suite of graphic applications. Painter is now wholly owned and marketed by Corel.

==Painter Series==
At one point, Painter had three companion applications: a vector-based natural media twin called Expression; a scaled-down version of Painter developed for beginners called Dabbler (later renamed Art Dabbler after the MetaCreations merger); and a grayscale-only clone called Sketcher. After the Corel acquisition, Art Dabbler 2 was reintroduced as Corel Painter Essentials, now in its sixth incarnation.

In 2007, Corel released version Painter X, which was at first available in a limited edition paint can, a nod to the packaging for early releases of the software.

===Painter Essentials===

Corel Painter Essentials is a less complex version of Painter designed for casual users. Multimedia tutorials, a more intuitive workspace, additional automated tasks and emphasis on photo retouching are some of the features included to appeal to beginners. Painter and Painter Essentials share much of the same underlying code, and have many of the same tools and functions. For professional artists, Essentials will offer fewer tools and variants, and considerably less control.
Actual in 2021 is Version 8.

===Painter Sketch Pad===
Corel Painter Sketch Pad, launched in January 2009, is the newest member of the Painter product series. Sketch Pad focuses on the conception and early design phase of image creation. It has 13 drawing tools compared to Painter&#x27;s almost 900 brushes, and a simple user interface that supports quick capturing of creative ideas. It is designed to work with a pen and drawing tablet.

==Reception==
In 2014, PC World called Painter &quot;the best natural-media painting program out there.&quot; In 2015, PC Magazine called it &quot;The best software for simulating painting and working with artistic media&quot;. In 2017, ZDNet said it &quot;remains one of the best digital painting tools for anyone with the skill to use traditional painting techniques onscreen&quot;.

<doc id="799545" wikidata="Q926536" url="?curid=799545" title="Lion of Belfort">
<text>The Lion of Belfort, in Belfort, France, is an 1880 monumental sculpture by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;).

== Overview ==
Finished in 1880, it is made entirely of red sandstone. The blocks it is made from were individually sculpted, then moved to the cliff below Belfort castle to be assembled. Twenty-two meters in length and 11 meters in height, the colossal work dominates the local landscape.

The lion symbolizes the heroic French resistance during the Siege of Belfort, a 103-day Prussian assault from December 1870 to February 1871. The city was successfully defended against 40,000 Prussians by merely 17,000 men (of whom only 3,500 were from the military) led by Colonel Denfert-Rochereau, with the fortress holding out until the Armistice of Versailles obligated French forces to abandon it.

Bartholdi&#x27;s first preparatory model depicted the lion facing defiantly east towards Prussia, but he was then asked to calm its expression to avoid a diplomatic fallout with the German Empire. In response he reversed the statue to face west with its rear to Prussia, but added an arrow beneath its front paw that points back towards the German border.

Smaller editions of the statue stand in the center of Place Denfert-Rochereau in Paris and also in Dorchester Square in Downtown Montreal.

<doc id="799557" wikidata="Q4997928" url="?curid=799557" title="Buntine, Western Australia">
<text>Buntine is a small town located in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, about north of Perth, the state capital, along the Great Northern Highway within the Shire of Dalwallinu.

The name Buntine was first used in 1910 as the name of a nearby hill. In 1913, it was applied to a railway siding on the railway line between Wongan Hills and Mullewa, at the suggestion of District Surveyor J P Camm. The town of Buntine was gazetted in 1916.

In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.

A local bulk wheat bin was opened in the town in December 1949 just in time for the harvesting season with being received on the first day.

<text>Jean-Christophe Beck (born in 1968) is a Canadian television and film score composer and conductor. He is best known for his collaborations with Disney and its subsidiaries, which include composing the soundtracks of &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011) and &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014), &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) and &quot;Frozen 2&quot; (2019), the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015), &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018), and &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023) as well as the TV miniseries &quot;WandaVision&quot; (2021), &quot;Hawkeye&quot; (2021), and &quot;Agatha All Along&quot; (2024) for Marvel Studios, and &quot;Free Guy&quot; (2021) for 20th Century Studios, as well as Disney’s 100th anniversary logo. 

He composed the scores for several of Shawn Levy&#x27;s films, including &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (2002), &quot;Just Married&quot; (2003), &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006), &quot;The Internship&quot; (2013), and &quot;Free Guy&quot; (2021). Notably, he won an Emmy Award in 1998 for his work on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. He is also known for composing the scores of the film series &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009-2013). He is the older brother of composer, pianist and rapper Chilly Gonzales.

== Early life ==
Beck started piano lessons at the age of five, and by the time he turned eleven, he was learning Bee Gees songs by ear and performing with his first band, Newton Talks, who licensed a song to &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;. Beck attended Crescent School where he studied piano, saxophone, and drums. He wrote two musicals while studying music at Yale University.

== Career ==
Upon graduation, Beck moved to Los Angeles to attend USC&#x27;s film scoring program, where he studied with Jerry Goldsmith. A personal recommendation from Buddy Baker, then head of the USC Music Department, led to his first assignment for a Canadian TV series called &quot;White Fang&quot;. Several TV series later, he was asked to score the second season of the WB Network show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Beck received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for his score to the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode, “Becoming, Part 1.”

In 2000, the cheerleading comedy &quot;Bring It On&quot; launched Beck&#x27;s film career. His credits include &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot;, &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot;, &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot;, and the &quot;Hangover&quot; trilogy. More recently, Beck scored the Oscar- and Grammy-winning animated film &quot;Frozen&quot;, and several installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). At the D23 Expo in 2022, it was announced that Beck had composed a new arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; to accompany Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary logo, conducted by Tim Davies, which debuted ahead of the film &quot;Strange World&quot;.

Beck works out of his studio in Santa Monica, California.

<text>The Baltic Governorates, originally the Ostsee Governorates, was a collective name for the administrative units of the Russian Empire set up in the territories of Swedish Estonia, Swedish Livonia (1721) and, afterwards, of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1795).

==History==
The Treaty of Vilnius of 1561 included the &quot;Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti&quot; by which the Polish King Sigismund II Augustus guaranteed the Livonian estates several privileges, including religious freedom with respect to the Augsburg Confession, the &quot;Indigenat&quot; (), and continuation of the traditional German jurisdiction and administration. The terms regarding religious freedom forbade any regulation of the traditional Protestant order by religious or secular authorities, and ruled that cases of disagreements be judged only by Protestant scholars. When in 1710 Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Russia during the Great Northern War, the capitulations explicitly referred to the &quot;Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti&quot;, with the respective references being confirmed in the Treaty of Nystad (1721).

The dominions of Swedish Estonia (in what is now northern Estonia) and Swedish Livonia (in what is now southern Estonia and northern Latvia) became the governorates of Reval and Riga, when they were conquered by Russia during the Great Northern War, and then ceded by Sweden in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. Notably, both Reval Governorate and Riga Governorate were each at the time subdivided into one province only: the province of Estonia and the province of Livonia, respectively. In the period of the so-called Regency, 1783–1796, the Regent&#x27;s (later Governor-General&#x27;s) Office in Riga was created. It consisted of two subdivisions dealing with local matters and Russian affairs.

After an administrative reform in 1796, the Reval Governorate was renamed Governorate of Estland (Эстляндская губерния), and Riga Governorate renamed Governorate of Livland (Лифляндская губерния). The third Baltic province of Courland was annexed into Russian Empire after the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795.

The Baltic Governor-General (Прибалтийский генерал-губернатор) was the representative of the Russian Emperor in the provinces of Livland, Estland and Courland. He was appointed by the Emperor and was subject to the latter as well as to the Senate. His duties were regulated by laws and instructions from central authorities. From the beginning of the 19th century he acted as an intermediate between the ministries in Saint Petersburg and administration of the Baltic governorates on spot.

The Governor-General, the highest local executive official and military authority, was in charge of the internal order in the provinces and had to take care of their overall security. He was in charge of recruiting troops and had to keep an eye on the garrisons and fortifications. His civil duties included supervising the provincial administration and prisons, maintaining land roads and bridges, issuing passports, and overseeing collection of state taxes and customs duties. He appointed and dismissed higher officials. The Office of the Baltic Governor-General was abolished at the beginning of the russification in the Baltic Provinces in 1876.

Similarly to guberniyas of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, the Baltic Governorates until the end of 19th century were not a subject to the common civil and administrative laws of the Russian Empire, but did not have monetary, fiscal and passport system of their own. Like guberniyas of the Kingdom of Poland they were treated as an integral entity and the Russian law provided them the preservation of local authorities. In Baltics these were Landtags. The special legislation which set rules for municipal administration and entrepreneurship according to local traditions, as well as the privileges to the local nobility in the Baltics was known under the collective name of &quot;Ostsee Right&quot; ().

From the end of the 18th century through 1917 names and territories of the Governorate of Courland (, ), the Governorate of Livland (, ) and the Governorate of Estland (, ) remained unchanged; the February Revolution of 1917 was followed by an internal redistribution of Latvian and Estonian lands between the latter two. The October Revolution of 1917 and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of 1918 created the prerequisites for declaration of independence of these governorships from Russia as the independent states of Estonia and Latvia.

<text>Kathleen Jessie Raine (14 June 1908 – 6 July 2003) was an English poet, critic and scholar, writing in particular on William Blake, W. B. Yeats and Thomas Taylor. Known for her interest in various forms of spirituality, most prominently Platonism and Neoplatonism, she was a founding member of the Temenos Academy.

==Life==
Kathleen Raine was born in Ilford, Essex, the only child of schoolmaster and Methodist lay preacher George Raine, from Wingate, County Durham, and Jessie (née Wilkie), a Scot who spoke Scots as her first language. The Raines had met as students at Armstrong College in Newcastle upon Tyne. Raine spent part of World War I, &#x27;a few short years&#x27;, with her Aunty Peggy Black at the manse in Great Bavington, Northumberland. She commented, &quot;I loved everything about it&quot;. For her it was an idyllic world and is the declared foundation of all her poetry. Raine always remembered Northumberland as Eden: &quot;In Northumberland I knew myself in my own place; and I never &#x27;adjusted&#x27; myself to any other or forgot what I had so briefly but clearly seen and understood and experienced.&quot; This period is described in the first book of her autobiography, &quot;Farewell Happy Fields&quot; (1973).

Raine noted that poetry was deeply ingrained in the daily lives of her maternal ancestors: &quot;On my mother&#x27;s side I inherited Scotland&#x27;s songs and ballads…sung or recited by my mother, aunts and grandmothers, who had learnt it from their mothers and grandmothers… Poetry was the very essence of life.&quot; Raine heard and read the Bible daily at home and at school, coming to know much of it by heart. Her father was an English master at County High School in Ilford. He had studied the poetry of Wordsworth for his M.Litt. thesis and had a passion for Shakespeare and Raine saw many Shakespearean plays as a child. From her father she gained a love of etymology and the literary aspect of poetry, the counterpart to her immersion in the poetic oral traditions. She wrote that for her poetry was &quot;not something invented but given…Brought up as I was in a household where poets were so regarded it naturally became my ambition to be a poet&quot;. She confided her ambition to her father who was sceptical of the plan. &quot;To my father&quot; she wrote &quot;poets belonged to a higher world, to another plane; to say one wished to become a poet was to him something like saying one wished to write the fifth gospel&quot;. Her mother encouraged Raine&#x27;s poetry from infancy.

Raine was educated at County High School, Ilford, and then read natural sciences, including botany and zoology, on an Exhibition at Girton College, Cambridge, receiving her master&#x27;s degree in 1929. While in Cambridge she met Jacob Bronowski, William Empson, Humphrey Jennings and Malcolm Lowry. In later life she was a friend and colleague of the kabbalist author and teacher, Z&#x27;ev ben Shimon Halevi.

Raine married Hugh Sykes Davies in 1930. She left Davies for Charles Madge and they had two children together, but their marriage also broke up as a result of Charles&#x27; affair with Inez Pearn, at that time married to the poet Stephen Spender. She also held an unrequited passion for Gavin Maxwell. The title of Maxwell&#x27;s most famous book &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot;, subsequently made into a film of the same name starring Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna, was taken from a line in Raine&#x27;s poem &quot;The Marriage of Psyche&quot;. The relationship with Maxwell ended in 1956 when Raine lost his pet otter, Mijbil, indirectly causing the animal&#x27;s death. Raine held herself responsible, not only for losing Mijbil but for a curse she had uttered shortly beforehand, frustrated by Maxwell&#x27;s homosexuality: &quot;Let Gavin suffer in this place as I am suffering now.&quot; Raine blamed herself thereafter for all Maxwell&#x27;s misfortunes, beginning with Mijbil&#x27;s death and ending with the cancer from which he died in 1969. From 1939 to 1941, Raine and her children shared a house at 49a Wordsworth Street in Penrith with Janet Adam Smith and Michael Roberts and later lived in Martindale. She was a friend of Winifred Nicholson.

Raine&#x27;s two children were Anna Hopwell Madge (born 1934) and James Wolf Madge (1936–2006). In 1959, James married Jennifer Alliston, the daughter of Jane Drew and James Alliston - Raine&#x27;s friends, both of whom were architects. James Wolf Madge then went on to marry Victoria Watson, another architect. 

At the time of her death, following an accident, Raine lived in London. She died of pneumonia after being knocked over by a reversing car after having posted a letter.

==Works==
Her first book of poetry, &quot;Stone And Flower&quot; (1943), was published by Tambimuttu, and illustrated by Barbara Hepworth. In 1946 the collection, &quot;Living in Time&quot;, was released, followed by &quot;The Pythoness&quot; in 1949. Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (2000) drew from eleven previous volumes of poetry. Her classics include &quot;Who Are We?&quot; There were many subsequent prose and poetry works, including her scholarly masterwork, the two-volume &quot;Blake and Tradition&quot; that was published in 1969 and derived from the A.W. Mellon Lectures that she delivered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C in 1968. Raine was the first woman lecturer in the history of the series and her research demonstrated the antiquity, coherence and integrity of William Blake&#x27;s philosophy, refuting T S Eliot&#x27;s assertion to the contrary (&quot;Collected Essays&quot;, 1932).

The story of her life is told in a three-volume autobiography notable for the author&#x27;s attempts to impose a structure on her memories that is quasi mythical, thus relating her own life to a larger pattern. This reflects patterns in her poetry, influenced by W. B. Yeats. The three books were originally published separately and later brought together in a single volume, entitled &quot;Autobiographies&quot; (in conscious imitation of Yeats), edited by Lucien Jenkins.

Raine made translations of Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Cousine Bette&quot; (&quot;Cousin Bette&quot;, 1948) and &quot;Illusions perdues&quot; (&quot;Lost Illusions&quot;, 1951).

She was a frequent contributor to the quarterly journal &quot;Studies in Comparative Religion&quot;, which dealt with religious symbolism and the Traditionalist perspective. With Keith Critchlow, Brian Keeble and Philip Sherrard she co-founded, in 1981, &quot;Temenos&quot;, a periodical, and later, in 1990, the Temenos Academy of Integral Studies, a teaching academy that stressed a multi-stranded universalist philosophy, and in support of her generally Platonist and Neoplatonist views on poetry and culture. She studied Thomas Taylor and published a selection of his works.

Raine was a research fellow at Girton College from 1955 to 1961. She taught at Harvard for at least one course about Myth and Literature offered to teachers and professors in the summer. She also spoke on Yeats and Blake and other topics at the Yeats School in Sligo, Ireland in the summer of 1974. A professor at Cambridge and the author of a number of scholarly books, she was an expert on Coleridge, Blake, and Yeats.

The contemporary composer David Matthews has written a song-cycle, &quot;The Golden Kingdom&quot;, on some of Raine&#x27;s poems. Richard Rodney Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Spells&quot; (1974–75), a work for soprano, chorus, and large orchestra, is set to texts by Raine.

==Honours==

<text>Vegeta is a brand of savoury condiments of dehydrated vegetables, spices, and MSG, produced by Croatian food company Podravka. It is considered a staple of Eastern European cuisine.

The product was originally developed at Podravka&#x27;s labs in Koprivnica, then part of Yugoslavia, in 1958. Zlata Bartl, a Bosnian Croat chemical technician who created a popular line of dehydrated soup packets, led the team that developed Vegeta. It was first sold in 1959 under the name &quot;Vegeta 40&quot;, and first exported in 1967 to Hungary and the Soviet Union. Vegeta has been produced by Podravka in Koprivnica since its introduction, and is also manufactured in Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Tanzania.

Vegeta was a commercial success for Podravka and led to an economic boom in Koprivnica. Bartl, who became known as &quot;Auntie Vegeta&quot; (), was made an honorary citizen of the city before her death in 2008. Nielsen named Vegeta the best-selling universal food seasoning in Europe in 2021, and the products are sold in 40 countries worldwide.

There is also a &quot;no MSG added&quot; version for those avoiding monosodium glutamate.

==Ingredients==

The ingredients of Vegeta include (according to the 2008 product packaging):
* salt max. 56%
* dehydrated vegetables 15.5% (carrot, parsnip, onions, celery, parsley leaves)
* flavour enhancers (MSG max. 15%, disodium inosinate)
* sugar
* spices
* cornstarch
* riboflavin (for yellow coloring)

<text>RSPB Minsmere is a nature reserve owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) at Minsmere, Suffolk. The site has been managed by the RSPB since 1947 and covers areas of reed bed, lowland heath, acid grassland, wet grassland, woodland and shingle vegetation. It lies within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Suffolk Heritage Coast area. It is conserved as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Area of Conservation, Special Protection Area and Ramsar site.

The nature reserve is managed primarily for bird conservation, particularly through control and improvement of wetland, heath and grassland habitats, with particular emphasis on encouraging nationally uncommon breeding species such as the bittern, stone-curlew, bearded tit, marsh harrier, nightjar and nightingale. The diversity of habitats has also led to a wide variety of other animals and plants being recorded on the site.

Before becoming a nature reserve, the area was the site of an ancient abbey and a Tudor artillery battery. The marshes were reclaimed as farmland in the 19th century, but were re-flooded during World War II as a protection against possible invasion.

The reserve has a visitor centre, eight bird hides and an extensive network of footpaths and trails. Entry is free for RSPB members. Potential future threats to the site include flooding or salination as climate change causes rising sea levels, coastal erosion and possible effects on water levels due to the construction of a new reactor at the neighbouring Sizewell nuclear power stations.

==Landscape==

The area around Minsmere consists of the wide valley of the Minsmere River with Dunwich cliffs to the north and Sizewell cliffs to the south. Two extensive sandbanks lie off the coast, and the beach is sand overlain with shingle. The cliffs have a maximum height of about and are amongst the most rapidly eroding in the UK, at an annual rate of .

From 500 BC to 700 AD, the sea level in Suffolk was about higher than it is today, and the low-lying areas of the present coast were then tidal estuaries. The river mouth was finally closed in the 18th century as sand and shingle deposits formed off the coast. The higher land consists of a deep layer of gravel and sand, the legacy of the beach formed by the sea before it retreated. The geology of the wetland areas below the topsoil is marine clay with darker freshwater deposits from the Minsmere River.

== History ==

===Before 1947===
In the Domesday Survey in 1086 Minsmere was known as &quot;Menesmara&quot; or &quot;Milsemere&quot;. It is recorded as having six households headed by freemen with one plough team. The manor, which was in the Hundred of Blythling, was held by Roger Bigot.

Ranulf de Glanvill, King Henry II&#x27;s Lord Chief Justice, founded a Premonstratensian abbey on the marshes at Minsmere in 1182. The area was embanked to protect the abbey from the sea and to reclaim farmland, but still suffered several years of severe flooding in the 14th century. The site was abandoned in 1363, and the stone from the buildings was used to rebuild Leiston Abbey at a new location further inland. The remains of the abbey church, fish pond and other buildings can still be detected below ground, but the only visible structure is the ruined chapel of St Mary, built within the nave of the former church. The lower section of the chapel was built soon after the demolition of the abbey in 1363, and the brick upper parts are thought to have been added by former abbot John Green, who lived there as a hermit when he retired from his post in 1527. The site was abandoned in 1537 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the only further construction being a pillbox that was built inside the chapel during World War II. The ruins are a scheduled monument of national importance.

Peat cutting took place at Minsmere from at least the 12th century, and a 1237 description of the coastline describes Minsmere as a port. In a survey of 1587, an early Tudor period artillery battery, constructed sometime after 1539 at Minsmere, was in ruins; the survey recommended that it be rebuilt. A coastguard station operated at Minsmere in the 1840s in an attempt to control smuggling along this stretch of the coast.

In about 1780 a sandbank closed the mouth of the Minsmere River, creating a large freshwater wetland on its inland side. The reeds that grew there were cut for thatching, and access was improved by using sand from the higher alluvial areas to build tracks across the marshes. These marshes were enclosed and drained for agricultural use in 1812 and 1813, following the passing of the relevant Act in 1810, with the main sluice being built to control drainage to the sea. The New Cut, a canal south of the river, was built as part of the drainage works, joining the river again at the sea sluice. The canal was used to transport the thatch crop inland by barge, its bridges being built particularly high to enable the bulky cargo to pass beneath. The drainage was improved after 1846 using steam-powered pumps. These were made by Richard Garrett &amp; Sons of the Leiston Iron Works.

There were four windmill sites on the levels. The Eastbridge Windpump was a smock mill built in the mid-19th century, probably by the millwright Robert Martin of Beccles. It stood north of the New Cut. The mill worked a three throw pump with square pistons. The windpump was working until 1939 and collapsed in February 1977. The remains were rescued by the Suffolk Mills Group in July 1977 and the mill was rebuilt at the Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket in the early 1980s. The Sea Wall Mill stood north of the New Cut but closer to the coast than the Eastbridge Windpump. It was a smock mill built in the early 19th century. The mill worked by wind until it was tailwinded in January 1935, breaking the windshaft and rendering the mill sail-less. The scoopwheel was subsequently worked by a Hupmobile petrol engine, and later by a diesel engine. The mill collapsed in the summer of 1976. A third smock mill stood south of the New Cut and seaward of the ruins of the chapel. Built by the millwright Collins of Melton, it was blown down in the 1920s and a Titt windpump was erected on the site to drive the scoopwheel. This windpump had sails diameter. Another Titt windpump, with sails diameter stood 1.6 km (a mile) south of this. Both Titt windpumps were standing in 1938.

The levels were re-flooded during World War II to defend against invasion along the East Anglian coast. Military defences were built at Minsmere and neighbouring Dunwich, including pillboxes, anti-aircraft defences, anti-tank blocks and barbed wire defence lines. The Army also used much of the heathland for military manoeuvres, including preparations for the invasion of continental Europe.

Before the war, the Ogilvie family had owned and managed the area as farmland and as a shooting estate, planting many deciduous trees as part of their hunting management plan. After the war, they decided to leave the marshes undrained, realising their ornithological value.

===RSPB era===

The RSPB had been considering the Minsmere site, at that time about in extent, as a potential reserve from the late 1930s, and a management agreement was signed in 1947. The appointment of Bert Axell as warden in 1959 led to major changes in reserve management, which were in due course also adopted elsewhere. He realised that ecological succession would eventually lead to the loss of important habitats, such as bare ground on the heaths or open water in the reed beds, unless natural plant colonisation was actively prevented. He created the &quot;scrape&quot;, an area with shallow water, islands and bare mud, by lowering land levels and managing the water level with new sluices. A circular path led around the scrape, giving access to hides on each of the four sides. In 1977, two years after Axell&#x27;s retirement, the RSPB purchased the reserve outright.

The Great Storm of 1987 destroyed 3,000 trees in one night. Many areas were reforested, but it was noticed that other badly affected woodlands nearby were colonised by woodlarks, so some recently acquired arable land was acidified and converted to heathland to encourage open-ground species.

Minsmere is one of a small number of UK sites at which bitterns breed. In 1979, nine booming males were counted but the population at Minsmere has varied over time, reaching a low of only one booming male in 1991. During the 1990s the existing reed beds were managed specifically for bitterns; when grazing marshes known as the North and South Levels were purchased, the North Levels were converted to reed bed and the South Levels to wet grassland.

The Minsmere reserve covers about of reed bed, open water, lowland heath, grassland, scrub, woodland, dune and shingle vegetation. The nature reserve, its habitats and wildlife, are protected under UK law as part of Minsmere–Walberswick Heaths and Marshes, which is a Special Protection Area, a Ramsar Site, a Special Area of Conservation and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site is also included in the areas covered by the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the Suffolk Heritage Coast.

== Access and facilities ==
The reserve is accessible by car from the A12 via the village of Westleton. It is also connected to Route 1 of the Sustrans National Cycle Network by the Suffolk Coast Cycle route. The nearest bus access is in the town of Leiston away and rail access is in Darsham distant. Coastlink, a demand responsive bus service, is available from these places to travel to the reserve but requires booking a day in advance. RSPB Minsmere is accessible on foot from Dunwich Heath, Sizewell Beach and Eastbridge, and there are of public rights of way around the reserve. Two long-distance walks, the Suffolk Coast Path and the Sandlings Walk, also connect to Minsmere.

The reserve was originally conceived as a protected site for rare breeding birds, and before 1980 permits were needed to visit. Only since 2005 has Minsmere opened every day of the week. The visitor centre was built in 1996 and expanded in 2012 using National Lottery and European Union funding. Visitor access to the various habitats has also been improved. Entry to the reserve is free for RSPB members, although a fee is charged for non-members. The site is open daily from dawn to dusk, year-round. The visitor centre and facilities are open from 9 am to 5 pm with some seasonal variations. The visitor centre provides a café, picnic area, shop, toilets and baby-changing facilities; guided walks, binocular hire and children&#x27;s &#x27;explorer packs&#x27; are also available. Only assistance dogs are allowed within the reserve; all other dogs must be kept within the car park or visitor centre, or on the public rights of way that surround the site.

The reserve was featured in the BBC &quot;Birdwatch&quot; live TV broadcasts in 1980, 1981 and 1989, and on &quot;Springwatch&quot; from 2014 to 2016.

== Management ==

The main management objectives at Minsmere are to maintain and improve the wetland, heath and grassland habitats. Water levels are managed using a system of sluices, surplus water eventually flowing into the sea at the main sluice on the New Cut. The sluices also keep seawater out of the reed beds, allowing control of salinity in the scrape. Vegetation is removed from the lagoons annually, and sections of the scrape are dried out and re-flooded on a five-year rotation. The scrape is protected from predators by an electric fence, improved in 2014 and 2015 when it was realised that badgers were attacking ground-nesting birds. The reed beds are grazed by Konik horses and Highland cattle while they are drained; this helps maintain the boundary between reed beds and open water areas. This control of reed density provides open water feeding pools for bitterns within the reed beds. The grazing regime was instituted following investigations into similar schemes in Sweden and Denmark.

The heathland and acidic grassland areas of Minsmere are managed by grazing, heather and scrub control and removal of trees and unwanted western gorse. The areas of gorse and scrub remaining are cut in rotation to keep the gorse short and dense, providing a scrub structure optimal for nightingales. In 1989, of arable land were purchased in a project to recreate lowland heath and acidic grassland habitat by acidification of the soil, the aim being to join fragmented patches of heathland together and to provide increased habitat for the stone-curlew, woodlark and nightjar, three threatened bird species. Methods used to acidify the land, which had been arable farmland for 150 years, included grazing by sheep or the addition of sulphur, either with bracken and heather waste, or on its own, followed by reseeding.

== Fauna and flora ==
Minsmere&#x27;s large size and variety of different habitats, some of which are scarce elsewhere in the UK, make it attractive to many species of animals and plants; around 5800 species have been recorded on the reserve.

===Birds===

As of 2017, 342 bird species have been sighted at Minsmere, of which 230 are annual and more than 100 have bred. In the 1990s the bittern was in serious decline with only one booming male on the reserve. Creation of ditches and pools and better water-level management led to 9–12 males being present annually, and application of these techniques elsewhere has revived the fortunes of this species in the UK as a whole. The stone curlew has also benefited from the creation of suitable bare-ground nesting habitat, and the reserve&#x27;s population is now nearly 10 pairs each year, against a single pair in Suffolk in the mid-1990s. The avocet first started its recolonisation of Britain in 1947, four pairs breeding a month after the reserve was acquired by the RSPB. Numbers at Minsmere now vary between 40 and about 140 pairs per year.

In 1971, the only nesting pair of marsh harriers in the UK were at Minsmere. The population of this polygynous species reached 17 nesting females in 2007, up from the more typical 8 to 10. Other important species are bearded tits, woodlarks, nightjars in open habitats, nightingales in the woodlands, and Dartford warblers, which returned to Minsmere&#x27;s heaths in the mid-1990s, having been lost to the area six decades earlier.

Many wildfowl winter on the reserve, including wigeon, gadwall and teal, and easterly winds can bring in passage migrants, sometimes in large numbers. These may include uncommon species such as bluethroats, wrynecks and dotterels.

Minsmere&#x27;s east-coast location and range of habitats make it a major site for rare species. Notable recent occurrences include Great Britain&#x27;s first western swamphen in 2016, a black-browed albatross in 2015, pallid harrier and collared pratincole in 2014, and Audouin&#x27;s gull and red-flanked bluetail in 2011.

===Other animals and plants===

Mammals found at Minsmere include a herd of about 300 red deer, otters, badgers and water voles, the last being protected by active control of introduced American mink which have led to major declines elsewhere. Other vertebrates include adders, small numbers of natterjack toads and 13 species of fish, of which common rudd is an important food source for bitterns.

Over 1000 species of moths and butterflies have been found at Minsmere, including a large breeding population of the silver-studded blue. Rare species include the scarce tortoiseshell butterfly and Britain&#x27;s only record of the moth species &quot;Catocala coniuncta&quot;, now given the English name of &quot;Minsmere crimson underwing&quot;.
Threatened moths include the flame wainscot, Fenn&#x27;s wainscot and white-mantled wainscot. The reserve has been colonised by two insect species that are currently expanding their ranges, the European beewolf and the antlion, and it also hosts the hairy-legged mining bee and the minotaur beetle; the latter large insect is a food item for stone-curlews.

Dead and decaying trees in the woodlands support a wide range of invertebrates and over 1500 species of fungus, including rare species such as moor club, deceiving bolete and lion&#x27;s mane mushroom. The shingle ridges on the beaches hold a variety of uncommon plants including yellow horned-poppy, red-tipped cudweed and round-leaved wintergreen.

==Threats==

The Suffolk coast has been subject to incursions from the sea for centuries, particularly notable events being the loss to the sea of most of the once-important town of Dunwich, next to Minsmere, in a series of storms in 1286, 1328 and 1347, and the 1953 storm which caused flooding and destruction in much of eastern England.

Minsmere faces threats from rising sea levels, caused by climate change, which adversely affect the drainage of the reserve and can lead to river flooding. Coastal erosion also threatens the integrity of the reserve. An Environment Agency assessment in 2011 estimated that Dunwich Heath, the beach at Minsmere and the artificial clay bank behind the beach could suffer severe damage within 20 years, although work by the Environment Agency at the north end of the reserve should hold the sea at bay there for 50 years.

The construction of two new reactors at the neighbouring Sizewell nuclear power site may also have a potential impact on the reserve. The RSPB and others have argued that the water table in the marshes could be adversely affected by the adjacent construction, both through contamination and by a change in water levels. There could also be changes to the coastline caused directly or indirectly by the actual construction.

An article written on behalf of the RSPB suggested that any damage to the wetlands at Minsmere is likely to have a major effect on UK bittern numbers since the reserve holds a significant proportion of the national breeding population. In 2018, expansion plans for Sizewell were called into question by National Infrastructure Commission proposals to scale back the nuclear power programme on safety and environmental grounds.

<doc id="799607" wikidata="Q1502402" url="?curid=799607" title="Tim Bray">
<text>Timothy William Bray (born June 21, 1955) is a Canadian software developer, environmentalist, political activist and one of the co-authors of the original XML specification. He worked for Amazon Web Services from December 2014 until May 2020 when he quit due to concerns over the terminating of whistleblowers. Previously he has been employed by Google, Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Bray has also founded or co-founded several start-ups such as Antarctica Systems.

==Education and early life==
Bray was born on June 21, 1955 in Alberta, Canada where his father worked for the Dominion Experimental Farm Service in Fort Vermilion. He grew up in Beirut, Lebanon, and returned to Canada to attend school at the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario. He graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science, double majoring in mathematics and computer Science. In 2009, he would return to Guelph to receive an honorary doctorate. Tim described his switch of focus from math to computer science this way: &quot;In math I’d worked like a dog for my Cs, but in CS I worked much less for As—and learned that you got paid well for doing it.&quot;

==Career==
Bray joined Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in Toronto as a software specialist. In 1983, Bray left DEC for Microtel Pacific Research. He joined the New Oxford English Dictionary (OED) project at the University of Waterloo in 1987 as its manager. It was during this time Bray worked with SGML, a technology that would later become central to both Open Text Corporation and his XML and Atom standardization work. Bray co-founded Antarctica Systems - in 2002, during his tenure as CEO for Antarctica, Bray was included in Upside magazine&#x27;s &quot;elite 100&quot; list, alongside other IT leaders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Dell and Larry Ellison. Bray was director of Web Technologies at Sun Microsystems from early 2004 to early 2010. He joined Google as a developer advocate in 2010 focusing on Android, and then on technologies related to &quot;identity&quot;, such as OAuth and OpenID. He left Google in March 2014, unwilling to relocate to Silicon Valley from Vancouver. He started working for Amazon Web Services (AWS) in December 2014. Bray left AWS in May 2020, after being dismayed by Amazon&#x27;s treatment of whistleblowers who had raised concerns over the safety of warehouse workers in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bray had held the vice president rank, stating on his blog that &quot;VPs shouldn&#x27;t go publicly rogue&quot;, and had much praise for AWS, yet he wasn&#x27;t pleased about his co-workers being fired. 

Bray&#x27;s entrepreneurial activities include:

===Waterloo Maple===
Bray served as the part-time chief executive officer of Waterloo Maple during 1989–1990. Waterloo Maple is the developer of the Maple mathematical software.

===Open Text Corporation===
Bray left the new OED project in 1989 to co-found Open Text Corporation with two colleagues. Open Text commercialised the search engine employed in the new OED project.

Bray recalled that “in 1994 I heard a conference speaker say that search engines would be big on the Internet, and in five seconds all the pieces just fell into place in my head. I realized that we could build such a thing with our technology.” Thus in 1995, Open Text released the Open Text Index, one of the first popular commercial web search engines. Open Text Corporation is publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol OTEX. From 1991 until 1996, Bray was senior vice president—technology&#x27;.

===Textuality===
Bray, along with his wife Lauren Wood, ran Textuality, a consulting practice in the field of web and publishing technology. He was contracted by Netscape in 1999, along with Ramanathan V. Guha, in part to create a new version of the Meta Content Framework called Resource Description Framework, which used the XML language.

===Antarctica Systems===
In 1999 he founded Antarctica Systems, a Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada-based company that specializes in visualization-based business analytics.

==Web standards==
Bray has contributed to standards in technology, particularly Web standards at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

===XML===
As an Invited Expert at the World Wide Web Consortium between 1996 and 1999, Bray co-edited the XML and XML namespace specifications. Halfway through the project Bray accepted a consulting engagement with Netscape, provoking vociferous protests from Netscape competitor Microsoft (who had supported the initial moves to bring SGML to the web.) Bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship. This led to intense dispute in the Working Group, eventually solved by the appointment of Microsoft&#x27;s Jean Paoli as third co-editor.

In 2001, Bray wrote an article called &quot;Taxi to the Future&quot; for Xml.com which proposed a means to improve web client user experience and web server system performance via a &quot;Transform-Aggregate-send XML-Interact&quot; architecture—this proposed system is very similar to the Ajax paradigm, popularized around 2005.

===W3C TAG===
Between 2001 and 2004 he served as a Tim Berners-Lee appointee to the W3C Technical Architecture Group.

===Atom===
Until October 2007, Bray was co-chair, with Paul Hoffman, of the Atom-focused Atompub Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Atom is a web syndication format developed to address perceived deficiencies with the RSS 2.0 format.

===JSON===
Bray worked with the IETF JSON Working Group in 2013 and 2014, serving as editor of RFC 7159, a specification of the JSON Data Interchange Format which revised RFC 4627 and highlighted interoperability best practices, released in March 2014. He also edited RFC 8259, a further revision of JSON.

==Software==
Bray has written software applications, including Bonnie which was the inspiration for Bonnie++, a Unix file system benchmarking tool; Lark, the first XML processor; and APE, the Atom Protocol Exerciser.

==Environmentalism==

Starting in 2018, Bray became visible as an environmentalist in the context of the Trans Mountain Pipeline dispute. On April 18, 2018, he was arrested for contempt of court at a demonstration at the Trans Mountain site in Burnaby, Canada. He also participated in an open letter from business leaders to the British Columbia government and was subsequently a public voice against the project.
In 2019, Bray was the only VP-level Amazon employee to sign a letter to Amazon shareholders calling for a stop to Amazon Web Services&#x27; support for oil extraction.

<doc id="799615" wikidata="Q782472" url="?curid=799615" title="Chawl">
<text>A chawl (Marathi: चाळ) is a type of residential building found in western India, similar to a tenement. Typically low quality housing, chawls are generally associated with poverty. The first chawls were constructed in the early 1700s, as housing for industrial workers.

==History==
Chawls are rooted in the history of Bombay&#x27;s (now Mumbai) colonial past. Workers migrated to Bombay from far and wide, as it was the center of trade for the East India Company. However, due to the land being unequally divided, British merchants and officials lived in sprawling bungalows, leaving little space for the working class. To accommodate this workforce, Chawls sprung up. These were tiny one room apartments shared by up to five people. Being highly congested, unsanitary, and unsafe, these were also more expensive than comparable accommodation in other Indian cities.

Town planning in Bombay finally came about due to fears of a plague epidemic, due to which The City Of Bombay Improvement Trust was established in 1898. Initial projects failed, displacing far more than they resettled. However, subsequent projects saw greater success, which largely included land reclamation projects to connect the Seven Islands of Bombay. This, along with modern apartments, led to availability of better housing, due to which chawls have declined. However, they may still be seen in the poorer parts of Mumbai.

==Description==
===Building layout===
Chawls are typically 4 to 5 stories tall, with between 8 and 16 dwellings on each floor. These dwellings are known as &quot;kholis (room)&quot;. A central staircase services the building and gives access to a long passage which runs the length of each floor. Many chawls are also built around a small courtyard, which functions as a communal space for residents. As many chawls are made with wood and often not subject to repairs, they become unstable or unsafe to live in over time, sometimes requiring relocation of the residents for fear that the structure may collapse.

===Sanitation===
Families on a floor have to share a common block of latrines. Tenements with private bathrooms are highly sought after and may be 50% more expensive than the price of a normal chawl. The lack of bathrooms has been credited with furthering disease outbreaks in chawls. Infestations of insects such as cockroaches or centipedes are not uncommon either, and with no rules about littering, sanitary conditions are usually very poor.

==Life for residents==
Despite poor sanitation and living conditions, chawls are often seen as &quot;middle class&quot; housing, and are often more affordable than much of the housing in Mumbai. Some chawls have shops or businesses incorporated into their structure, which provide employment or shopping opportunities to the inhabitants.

Residents of chawls sometimes cite a sense of community where everything is shared amongst themselves; the cramped design of chawls forces social interaction between residents and very often special occasions such as weddings or religious festivals are celebrated communally.

==In popular culture==
In Mulk Raj Anand&#x27;s novel &quot;Coolie&quot;, the central character Munoo lives with two family groups in a chawl during his time in Bombay with detailed descriptions of the living circumstances. The 2019 Marathi-language drama film, &quot;15 August&quot; () revolves around life in a chawl, with the majority of the filming taking place there. In Kiran Nagarkar&#x27;s novel &quot;Ravan &amp; Eddie&quot;, both main characters and their families live in a chawl.

Chawls are featured in the Mumbai level in the game &quot;Hitman 2&quot;.

* Casa di ringhiera a very similar type of housing built in the same period, and for the same purposes in Northern Italy.
* Corrala, casa de corredor, or edificación de vecindad, a similar structure typical of Madrid, but also found in some other towns in Castile, as well as in parts of Andalusia and some other cities in Spain.
* Corral de comedias, this same structure used as a venue for theater, especially in Madrid during the Spanish Golden Age.

<text>, also known as is a Shingon Buddhist temple in the Minami-ku ward of Kyoto, Japan.

Founded in 796, it was one of the only three Buddhist temples allowed in the city at the time it became the capital of Japan. As such it has a long history, housing treasures and documents from the early Heian period and the Tang dynasty, and with buildings in its complex covering the Kamakura, Muromachi, Momoyama, and Edo periods. Five of these buildings have been designated National Treasures in two different categories: the Lotus Flower Gate (&quot;rengemon&quot;), the Miei Hall (&quot;mieidō&quot;), the Golden Hall (&quot;kondō&quot;) and the five-storied Pagoda (&quot;gojūnotō&quot;) (temple buildings) and the Kanchiin Guest Hall (&quot;kanchiin kyakuden&quot;) (residences).

Tō-ji was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, as part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto.

==History==
Tō-ji was founded in the early Heian period. The temple dates from 796, two years after the capital moved to Heian-kyō. Together with its partner Sai-ji, and the temple Shingon-in (located in the Heian Palace), it was one of only three Buddhist temples allowed in the capital at the time and is the only of the three to survive to the present.

It once had a partner, Sai-ji (West Temple) and, together, they stood alongside the Rashomon, the gate to the Heian capital. It was formerly known as which indicates that it previously functioned as a temple providing protection for the nation. Tō-ji is located in Minami-ku near the intersection of Ōmiya Street and Kujō Street, southwest of Kyōto Station.

Tō-ji is often associated with Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai). Though Tō-ji began to decline at the end of the Heian period, it came back into the spotlight with the rise of Daishi Shinko (worshipping of Kōbō Daishi) in the Kamakura period. The well-known Buddhist priest was put in charge of Tō-ji in 823 by order of Emperor Saga. The temple&#x27;s principal image is of Yakushi Nyorai, the Medicine Buddha. Many religious services for Daishi are held in (or , in another name), the residence of Kōbō Daishi. In 1586, the temple was seriously damaged by an earthquake.

==Architecture==


===Five-storey Pagoda===
The of Tō-ji dates from 1643 (Edo period), when it was rebuilt by order of the third Tokugawa Shōgun, Iemitsu. The original pagoda was built in the 9th century, but it was destroyed and rebuilt four times before reaching its current state. It was designated a National Treasure in 1952.

The pagoda stands high, and is the tallest wooden tower in Japan. Entrance into the pagoda itself is permitted only on special occasions, but it is usually open and the interior can be seen from the outside. It houses relics, sculptures, and paintings. At ground level, there are statues of four Buddhas facing different directions.

===Kondo===
The &quot;Kondo&quot; or Golden Hall is the main hall of the temple and contains a statue of Yakushi from 1603.

===Miedo===
The Miedo is dedicated to Kobo Daishi, also called Kukai, the temple&#x27;s founder. It stands on the location of his original residence. The hall is opened on the 21st of each month when a memorial service is held for Kukai.

===Temple grounds===
The grounds feature a garden and pond, in which turtles and koi swim. The grounds also house an academically rigorous private school, Rakunan, from which many students are sent to elite universities.

===Architectural Analysis===
Tō-ji was rebuilt in the early Edo Period, verging on the Kamakura Period. During this rebuild, Tō-ji was dedicated to be a Shingon Buddhist temple (Shingon, a form of Vajrayana Buddhism, was brought to Japan by Kūkai, a priest in 806). These temples were typically built in the mountains and utilized more natural and demographic design elements, dictating the resulting architectural layout. In the Kamakura period, Japanese architects began to utilize technology to resist damage from earthquakes, rainfall, sun, and heat damage. These fortifications were integrated into the remodeling of Tō-ji. This style of building defending against the natural elements evolved into the Zenshūyō style, seen later on in the Kamakura period. This style utilizes the &quot;hidden roof&quot; innovation. Zenshūyō style temples, such as Tō-ji, are characterized by linear spacing outlines of the Garan, hinging panel doors, cusped windows called Katōmado, and decorative pent roofs called Mokoshi. Although containing many of the elements of Zenshūyō style architecture, the Tō-ji temple uses the natural land around it to dictate the layout of the garan, which is a technique used in the Heian Period and Edo Period of Japanese Architecture. This correlates with the Shingon attribution by Emperor Saga in 823. The decorative mokoshi and outfitting of modern structural technology (of the time), were most likely integrated during the remodeling of the tower in the Kamakura Period.

Recognizing the historical and spiritual significance of Tō-ji, UNESCO designated it, along with several other treasures in Kyoto Prefecture, as part of the &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto&quot; World Heritage Site.

==Flea market==
On the 21st of each month, a famous flea market is held on the grounds of Tō-ji. This market is popularly called Kōbō-san, in honor of Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai), who died on the 21 of the third Month of 835 AD (22 April in the Western Calendar). The flea market features a variety of antiques, art, clothes, pottery, some food, and typical second-hand flea market goods. By far the largest market is held on December 21, as it is the last of the year.

A similar market is held on the 25th of every month at Kitano Tenmangū, also called Tenjin. A Kyoto proverb proclaims, &quot;Fair weather at Tō-ji market means rainy weather at Tenjin market&quot;, calling to mind Kyoto&#x27;s fickle weather.

A smaller, less-crowded, antique-oriented market is held at the Tō-ji grounds on the first Sunday of each month.

==Sai-ji==

The Rashomon was formerly situated to the west of Tō-ji, though now only a marker remains, reachable a short walk west along Kujō street. A little further west was Sai-ji (West Temple), though now only a small park remains.

Tō-ji and Sai-ji were built at the southern edge of the capital and were the only Buddhist temples officially allowed in Heian-kyō at the time. Sai-ji disappeared in the 16th century. The reason was bad irrigation of Ukyō-ku and the lack of funds to maintain it.

A legend says that at the time of a great drought, Kūkai, the priest at Tō-ji, and Shubin, his colleague at Sai-ji, were both praying for rainfall. Kūkai succeeded where Shubin had failed, and Shubin, envious, shot an arrow at Kūkai. At that time a Jizō appeared and took the arrow instead of Kūkai, saving his life. The Jizō is near the ruins of Rashōmon. It has been chipped where the arrow is thought to have hit.

==Events==
In 1995, the temple was the stage of the Yanni World Tour,

On July 7, 2007, one of the Live Earth concerts (held to raise awareness of the Earth&#x27;s climate) was staged at Tō-ji; artists who played included Bonnie Pink, Michael Nyman, Rip Slyme, UA and the Yellow Magic Orchestra.

<text>Kim Perrot (January 18, 1967 – August 19, 1999) was an American basketball player. She played in the WNBA for the Houston Comets and won three championships, the third being a posthumous honor by the Comets.

==College==
Perrot attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette) and played four years there as a guard. In one game against the University of Southeastern Louisiana, she scored 58 points, the third most in NCAA history.

==Southwestern Louisiana statistics==

==WNBA==
After playing six seasons in Europe, Perrot joined the WNBA in the summer of 1997 for its inaugural season. Perrot played point guard for the Houston Comets and her debut game was played on June 21, 1997. On that day, the Comets defeated the Cleveland Rockers 76 - 56 with Perrot recording 2 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 steals.
At 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m), she was noted there for her ferocious play and was a crowd favorite. Her best friend was Comets star Cynthia Cooper.

Perrot was the starting point guard for the Comets for 24 of the team&#x27;s 28 games (for the other 4 games, teammate Tiffany Woosley would start in Perrot&#x27;s place) and would go on to average 5.8 points, 2.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.5 steals per game for the season. The Comets finished with an 18 - 10 record and made it to the WNBA Finals where they defeated the New York Liberty to win the WNBA&#x27;s first championship in league history.

Perrot would remain the Comets&#x27; starting point guard for the 1998 season and started in all 30 of the team&#x27;s regular season games. Perrot played more minutes in her sophomore season and had increased productivity across the board, averaging 8.5 points, 3.1 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.8 steals per game. The Comets finished with an incredible 27 - 3 record and once again won the WNBA championship by defeating the Phoenix Mercury in a best-of-3 series.

After the 1998 season, Perrot would not play in the WNBA again as she was diagnosed with lung cancer in February 1999. While she was not on the basketball court with the Comets that year, many of her teammates considered her to be a spiritual uplifting force for the team.

Perrot wore jersey number 10 with the Comets organization and averaged 7.2 points, 3.3 steals, and 2.9 rebounds per game during her two seasons with the team.

Her final game ever was Game 3 of the 1998 WNBA Finals on September 1, 1998, where she recorded 13 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists to help Houston defeat Phoenix 80 - 71.

==Death and legacy==
Perrot succumbed to her illness on August 19, 1999. The cancer had metastasized to Perrot&#x27;s brain. She underwent surgery and radiation treatments to eradicate the tumors in her head, but declined chemotherapy recommended by her doctors. Perrot went to Mexico to seek alternative methods to battle cancer. Many attribute her death to that move—but metastasized lung cancer gave her no chance of survival with conventional medicine. In Mexico, she was joined by Cooper. Two days before her death, she took a Medevac flight back to Houston from Tijuana, with Cooper and members of the Perrot family flying along. She was the first active player in the WNBA to die.

After her death, the Comets went on to win a third straight WNBA title in 1999, and a tearful Cooper celebrated what the team called &quot;#3 for #10&quot;. She was posthumously awarded a third championship ring and her #10 jersey was retired, thus making her the first player in league history to have her number retired. The WNBA subsequently renamed their sportsmanship award the Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award in her honor.

Comets fans raised money to create &quot;Kim&#x27;s Place&quot;, an area at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where kids with cancer can play games, sports, and relax. Also, the &quot;Kim Perrot Leadership Award&quot; was created by the Houston Can! Academy (a charter school for at risk youth). While ill with cancer, Perrot had made many public appearances and given motivational speeches, mostly at schools.

Perrot is buried at the Our Lady of the Assumption Cemetery in Carencro, Louisiana.

<text>Meary James Thurairajah Tambimuttu (15 August 1915 – 23 June 1983) was a Tamil poet, editor, critic and publisher, who for many years played a significant part in the literary scenes of London and New York City. In 1939 he founded the respected literary magazine &quot;Poetry London&quot;, which &quot;soon became the best known poetry periodical in England, and Tambimuttu became widely known as a skillful editor.&quot; Four issues of &quot;Poetry London–New York&quot; were published in the 1950s; the fifth in 1960. Among those published by Tambimuttu were Lawrence Durrell, Kathleen Raine, W. H. Auden, Gavin Ewart, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, Roy Campbell, Robin Skelton, Keith Douglas, Norman Nicholson, and many other notable writers. In 1955 Tambimuttu was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;probably the best-known contemporary Indian poet&quot;. He created two publishing houses, Editions Poetry London (established in 1943) and Lyrebird Press (1968), both of which published major works.

==Biography==
Tambimuttu was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), had his primary education at the premier Catholic institution St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Colombo, and attended university in Colombo before leaving for London at the age of 22. He arrived in 1938, and a year later he began to publish &quot;Poetry London&quot;, a small magazine that was to be important in the next decade, in particular during the war years. Tambi, as he was called by his friends, met Lawrence Durrell at this time in connection with the small magazine that Durrell published in Paris, &quot;Delta&quot; (developing from &quot;The Booster&quot;). As well as editing 14 volumes of &quot;Poetry London&quot;, Tambi was also involved in book publishing, writing his own poetry and short fiction, as well as being a regular participant in the BBC radio broadcasts &quot;Talking To India&quot; during World War II.

In July 1943 he set up the publishing house Editions Poetry London, which published Elizabeth Smart&#x27;s &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot;, David Gascoyne &quot;Poems 1937-1942&quot;, Lawrence Durrell&#x27;s &quot;Cefalu&quot;, Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Cosmological Eye&quot; and &quot;Sunday After the War&quot;, Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot;, Keith Douglas&#x27; &quot;Alamein to Zem Zem&quot;, and Cleanth Brooks&#x27; &quot;Modern Poetry and the Tradition&quot;. Other poets published in &quot;Poetry London&quot; are a veritable &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of late modernist poetry. In 1943, Tambimuttu commissioned the young artist Lucian Freud to illustrate a book of poems by Nicholas Moore entitled &quot;The Glass Tower&quot;. It was published the following year by Editions Poetry London and comprised, among other drawings, a stuffed zebra and a palm tree.

Tambimuttu returned to Ceylon in 1949, and in 1952 moved to the United States, where he worked as an editor, launching &quot;Poetry London – New York&quot; (1956–60), the last issue 5 including American Beat poets.

He returned to London in 1968 and founded the Lyrebird Press. He became important to the development of the October Gallery, which opened in 1979, and where he maintained an office, introducing many Indian and Sri Lankan artists and poets to the gallery. He died aged 67 in London. Archives of Tambimuttu&#x27;s correspondence and papers are dispersed, but the largest collections are at Northwestern University and the British Library.

Most of Tambimuttu&#x27;s own works are difficult to access, and his earliest works published before he came to London are lost. His greatest influence was as an editor and publisher, especially during the 1940s. T. S. Eliot, Lawrence Durrell, Dylan Thomas count among his influences, while he influenced Lawrence Durrell, Elizabeth Smart, Nicholas Moore, Kathleen Raine, Gavin Maxwell, and George Barker.

<doc id="799623" wikidata="Q4885137" url="?curid=799623" title="Bempton Cliffs">
<text>Bempton Cliffs is a section of precipitous coast at Bempton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is run by the RSPB as a nature reserve and is known for its breeding seabirds, including northern gannet, Atlantic puffin, razorbill, common guillemot, black-legged kittiwake and fulmar. There is a visitor centre.

==Location==
The hard chalk cliffs at Bempton rise are relatively resistant to erosion and offer many sheltered headlands and crevices for nesting birds. The cliffs run about from Flamborough Head north towards Filey and are over high at points.

The cliffs at Bempton are some of the highest chalk cliffs in England, Beachy Head in East Sussex being the highest at . The area administered by the RSPB also includes Buckton Cliffs.

There are good walkways along the top of the cliffs and several well fenced and protected observation points.

==Gannets==
Bempton Cliffs is home to the only mainland breeding colony of gannets in England. The birds arrive at the colony from January and leave in August and September.

==Kittiwakes==
Numerically the most common bird, around 10% of the United Kingdom population of kittiwakes (&quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot;) nest here.

==Puffins==
The Atlantic puffins (&quot;Fratercula arctica&quot;) at Bempton Cliffs tend to nest in rock crevices, whereas burrows are used at most UK sites. Although there are estimated to be around 958 birds (450 breeding pairs), it is relatively difficult to get a close view of them. The puffins along the Yorkshire coast are now endangered.

The Bempton puffins mostly fly east to the Dogger Bank to feed. Their numbers may however be adversely affected by a reduction in local sand eel numbers caused by global warming, in turn caused by plankton being driven north by the 2 degree rise in local sea temperatures.

==Artwork==
A series of 22 panels of phonetic birdsong by artist Adrian Riley were commissioned by the RSPB in 2017 and are installed across the site near habitats appropriate to the birdsong in each panel.

<doc id="799626" wikidata="Q131060" url="?curid=799626" title="Adephaga">
<text>The Adephaga (from Greek ἀδηφάγος, &quot;adephagos&quot;, &quot;gluttonous&quot;) are a suborder of beetles, and with more than 40,000 recorded species in 10 families, the second-largest of the four beetle suborders. Members of this suborder are collectively known as adephagans. The largest family is Carabidae (ground beetles) which comprises most of the suborder with over 40,000 species. Adephaga also includes a variety of aquatic beetles, such as predaceous diving beetles and whirligig beetles.

==Anatomy==
Adephagans have simple antennae with no pectination or clubs. The of the maxillae usually consist of two segments. Adult adephagans have visible notopleural sutures. The first visible abdominal sternum is completely separated by the hind coxae, which is one of the most easily recognizable traits of adephagans. Five segments are on each foot.

===Wings===
The transverse fold of the hind wing is near the wing tip. The median nervure ends at this fold, where it is joined by a cross nervure.

===Internal organs===
Adephagans have four Malpighian tubules. Unlike the genetical structures of other beetles, yolk chambers alternate with egg chambers in the ovarian tubes of adephagans. The coiled, tubular testes consist of a single follicle, and the ovaries are polytrophic.

==Chemical glands==
All families of adephagan have paired pygidial glands located posterodorsally in the abdomen, which are used for secreting chemicals. The glands consist of complex invaginations of the cuticle lined with epidermal cells contiguous with the integument. The glands have no connection with the rectum and open on the eighth abdominal tergum.

Secretions pass from the secretory lobes, which are aggregations of secretory cells, through a tube to a reservoir lined with muscles. This reservoir then narrows to a tube leading to an opening valve. The secretory lobes differ structurally from one taxon to another; it may be elongated or oval, branched basally or apically, or unbranched.

==Delivery of glandular compounds==
Secretion can occur in multiple manners:
*Oozing: if the gland is not muscle-lined, the discharge is limited in amount.
*Spraying: if the gland is muscle-lined, which is typically the case of carabids, the substances are ejected more or less forcefully.
*Crepitation: boiling noxious chemical spray ejected with a popping sound. Crepitation is only associated with the Brachininae carabids and several related species. See bombardier beetle for a detailed description.

The secretions differ in the chemical constituents, according to the taxa. Gyrinids, for instance, secrete norsesquiterpenes such as gyrinidal, gyrinidione, or gyrinidone. Dytiscids discharge aromatic aldehydes, esters, and acids, especially benzoic acid. Carabids typically produce carboxylic acids, particularly formic acid, methacrylic acid, and tiglic acid, but also aliphatic ketones, saturated esters, phenols, aromatic aldehydes, and quinones.

Accessory glands or modified structures are present in some taxa: the Dytiscidae and Hygrobiidae also possess paired prothoracic glands secreting steroids; and the Gyrinidae are unique in the extended shape of the external opening of the pygidial gland.

The function of many compounds remain unknown, yet several hypotheses have been advanced:
*As toxins or deterrent against predators; some compounds indirectly play this role by easing the penetration of the deterrent into the predator&#x27;s integument.
*Antimicrobial and antifungal agents (especially in Hydradephaga)
*A means to increase wettability of the integument (especially in Hydradephaga)
*Alarm pheromones (especially in Gyrinidae)
*Propellant on water surfaces (especially in Gyrinidae)
*Conditioning plant tissues associated with oviposition

==Distribution and habitat==
Habitats range from caves to rainforest canopy and alpine habitats. The body forms of some are structurally modified for adaptation to habitats: members of the family Gyrinidae live at the air-water interface, Rhysodinae live in heartwood, and Paussinae carabids inhabit ant nests.

==Feeding==
Most species are predators. Other less-typical forms of feeding include: eating algae (family Haliplidae), seed-feeding (harpaline carabids), fungus-feeding (rhysodine carabids), and snail-feeding (licinine and cychrine carabids). Some species are ectoparasitoids of insects (brachinine and lebiine carabids) or of millipedes (peleciine carabids).

==Reproduction and larval stage==
Some species are ovoviviparous, such as pseudomorphine carabids.

The larvae are active, with well-chitinized cuticle, often with elongated cerci and five-segmented legs, the foot-segment carrying two claws. Larvae have a fused labrum and no mandibular molae.

==Phylogeny==
Adephagans diverged from their sister group in the Late Permian, the most recent common ancestor of living adephagans probably existing in the early Triassic, around 240 million years ago. Both aquatic and terrestrial representatives of the suborder appear in fossil records of the late Triassic. The Jurassic fauna consisted of trachypachids, carabids, gyrinids, and haliplid-like forms. The familial and tribal diversification of the group spans the Mesozoic, with a few tribes radiating explosively during the Tertiary.

The adephagans were formerly grouped into the Geadephaga with the two terrestrial families Carabidae and Trachypachidae and the Hydradephaga, for the aquatic families. However this is no longer used as the Hydradephaga are not a monophyletic group. Modern analysis has supported the clade Dytiscoidea instead, which includes many aquatic adephagans, notably excluding Gyrinidae. Rhysodidae is suggested to represent a subgroup of Carabidae rather than a distinct family, with Cicindelidae often being treated as a distinct family from Carabidae.

<text>Ann Black is a British political activist who serves as a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party. She served from 2000 to 2018 and was re-elected in November 2020. She was chair of the NEC from 2009 to 2010, and has also served as chair of the NEC&#x27;s disputes panel.

== Career ==
In 2013, Black worked as a computer programmer at Oxford Brookes University. She is a member of the Unison trade union.

== Political career ==

=== Labour in government, 2000–2010 ===
Black was first elected to the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) as a representative for Constituency Labour Party groups (CLPs) in 2000. At the time, she was campaigning for pensions to be linked to earnings instead of prices.

In September 2002, Black wrote a paper for the committee expressing concern about the invading Iraq. In 2003, she wrote a statement encouraging the government to hold a referendum on introducing the Euro. Later that year, she voted in favour of readmitting the mayor of London Ken Livingstone to the Labour Party after he had been expelled for running for election against a Labour candidate in the 2000 London mayoral election, but against using the selection method a Labour incumbent official would go through. In 2004, she wrote to the Labour leader and prime minister Tony Blair opposing his invitation of Ayad Allawi, the prime minister of Iraq, saying that &quot;most people want to put Iraq behind them and unite around Labour&#x27;s positive domestic agenda&quot;. She spoke out against the Labour government&#x27;s plans to introduce ID cards in 2005. She was re-elected a CLP representative in 2006. In 2009, she served as vice-chair of the NEC. In the same year, she was one of three members of a panel of NEC members that investigated allegations against Labour MPs in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal. In 2010, she was chair of the NEC.

=== Labour in opposition, 2010–present ===
In the 2010 Labour Party leadership election, Black urged Labour Members of Parliament to nominate candidates they might not go on to vote for in order to provide a more diverse range of candidates, which was seen as support for nominating Diane Abbott. When determining the rules for the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, Black opposed checking new members against the party&#x27;s canvassing records. In the election, she was reported as having voted for Jeremy Corbyn. Later that year, she worked on a report about representation of women in the Labour Party with the shadow minister for women and equalities Kate Green.

In July 2016, Owen Smith challenged Corbyn for the leadership of the party in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election. Black supported Corbyn being automatically included on ballots, and an increase in the price to become a registered supporter of the party. She also proposed that members who joined before 24 June should be able to vote, but the proposal failed due to a tied vote. She then supported making 12 January the cut-off. In the election, she was reported as having voted for Corbyn. Ahead of the 2016 election for CLP representatives on the NEC, the Labour Representation Committee said that it wouldn&#x27;t support Black due to her votes determining the electorate for the 2016 leadership election, and for supporting the suspension of Brighton and Hove Labour Party. It went on to support her as part of the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance (CLGA) group of candidates. In October 2016, Black was re-elected to the NEC with more votes than any other candidate.

In January 2018, Black was replaced as chair of the committee&#x27;s disputes panel with Christine Shawcroft, who Stephen Bush described in the New Statesman as &quot;regarded as more of a reliable factional operator&quot;. Shawcroft resigned from the role in March of the same year. In February, Momentum announced a slate of candidates for the year&#x27;s elections to the NEC that didn&#x27;t include Black, reportedly because of how Black had voted to determine the electorate for the 2016 leadership election. She was expected to win the election to be chair of the National Policy Forum (NPF) later that month. The election was postponed by allies of Corbyn minutes before it was due to go ahead. Black was elected as chair of the NPF in April 2018. Black stood in the 2018 election for CLP representatives on the NEC without the support of the CLGA. During the election, Momentum withdrew its support for Peter Willsman, which led to speculation that Black might win a seat. She came in thirteenth place, with nine candidates elected.

In September 2019, after the 2019 United Kingdom general election was announced, Black criticised the NEC for prioritising formal re-selection processes for Labour MPs over organising selections for constituencies which didn&#x27;t have a candidate.

Black has been described as &quot;independently minded&quot; and &quot;left-wing&quot;, and a swing vote on the NEC.

In November 2020 she was re-elected to the NEC.

== Honours ==
Black was made an Officer of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for &quot;parliamentary and political service&quot;.

<text>Magic Dirt is an Australian rock band, which formed in 1991 in Geelong, Victoria, with Daniel Herring on guitar, Adam Robertson on drums, Adalita Srsen on vocals and guitar, and Dean Turner on bass guitar. Initially forming an alternative underground band called Deer Bubbles which split and formed into the much heavier, rock based group called The Jim Jims, they were renamed as Magic Dirt. Their top 40 releases on the ARIA Albums Chart are &quot;Friends in Danger&quot; (1996), &quot;What Are Rock Stars Doing Today&quot; (2000), &quot;Tough Love&quot; (2003) and &quot;Snow White&quot; (2005). They have received nine ARIA Music Award nominations including four at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 for &quot;Life Was Better&quot; – their second extended play. Turner died in August 2009 of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (a soft tissue cancer). From 2010 to November 2018, the band were on hiatus.

==History==

===Early days (1991–1993)===
Magic Dirt formed as Deer Bubbles in 1991 in Geelong, Victoria with Adalita Srsen on vocals and guitar, and Dean Turner on bass guitar. Within the same year, they started a new band, with transitory names such as &quot;Detroit&quot;, &quot;Brad&quot; and &quot;The Jim Jims&quot;, with guitarist Daniel Herring. Using the transitory name, &quot;The Jim Jims&quot;, the band recorded a cover version of The Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Heroin&quot; for a Geelong compilation called &quot;Check This Action ... Let the Fun Begin&quot;, released in 1992. After the addition of drummer Adam Robertson, they became known as Magic Dirt. Srsen told a fanzine in 1996, &quot;...we used to be in a band before Magic Dirt called Deer Bubbles. Dean knew Daniel from skating, and then he moved in with us, and we&#x27;d play like one song for forty minutes, we just loved it. Then we wanted to find a drummer, and we went through about five, then we found Adam through a mutual friend and that was it. We only used to have three songs we used to play for an hour&quot;.

Early in 1993, the band supported Sonic Youth and Pavement on their Australian tours. Later in the year, the band issued its debut single, &quot;Supertear&quot;, for Fellaheen Records. By the time of its release in July, the band had broken up. However, they soon regrouped and signed with Au Go Go Records in November. Their first extended play, &quot;Signs of Satanic Youth&quot; appeared in December, with the track &quot;Redhead&quot; receiving airplay on Triple J radio.

===The Au Go Go years (1994–1999)===

====&quot;Life Was Better&quot; EP====
In April 1994, Magic Dirt split however, the group again reformed and released a second EP, &quot;Life Was Better&quot; in November. The EP included the tracks &quot;Ice&quot; and &quot;Amoxycillin&quot; and debuted at No. 1 on the Australian alternative music chart. It remained on that chart for 75 weeks, eventually selling 20,000 copies. &quot;Life Was Better&quot; went on to receive four nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995.

In early 1995, the band performed on the Big Day Out festival tour across Australia, with Hole (Magic Dirt also supported their other Australian shows) and Silverchair. The success of &quot;Life Was Better&quot; had attracted international attention and Geoffrey Weiss, of Warner Music in the United States, traveled to Australia to see the band perform at the Big Day Out. Weiss negotiated a deal with their manager, Gavan Purdy and the band signed a two-album deal with Warner. In August 1995, Daniel Herring left the band. His final recording with the group was the 10&quot; vinyl single, &quot;I Was Cruel&quot;, which featured the words &quot;Thankyou, Daniel. Goodbye&quot; etched onto the vinyl. Dave Thomas, of fellow Geelong band Bored!, who had managed Magic Dirt at the early stages of their career, was recruited as Herring&#x27;s replacement on guitar.

====&quot;Friends in Danger&quot;====
In late 1995, Dirt Records released the band&#x27;s debut album in the US. The album was a compilation of their first two EPs, along with the track &quot;Goofy Gumb&quot;, and titled simply &quot;Magic Dirt&quot;. In March, Magic Dirt began recording their debut album proper, &quot;Friends in Danger&quot;, in Sydney with Paul McKercher (You Am I) producing. The music style was a reaction to the accessibility of their earlier material. While Warner had expected more songs in the vein of &quot;Ice&quot;, the band offered tracks like the 8-minute &quot;Bodysnatcher&quot;. Warner were less than impressed, and went so far as to offer the band additional time and money to re-record the album. The band refused, and when &quot;Friends in Danger&quot; was released in September, the label put little effort into promoting it. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, &quot;[it] matched the band&#x27;s fearless experimentation with a dark, unhinged sound that went from moments of eerie near-silence to full-tilt guitar noise&quot;. &quot;Friends in Danger&quot; peaked at No. 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and went on to sell 10,000 copies in Australia, helped along by &quot;Sparrow&quot;, the album&#x27;s most accessible track.

The group toured North America supporting Archers of Loaf and promoting &quot;Friends in Danger&quot; later in 1996. Warner still refused to promote the album and they were dropped by the label. Since the band had a two-album deal, Warner paid them for the second album, despite the fact that they did not release it.

====&quot;Young &amp; Full of the Devil&quot;====
In January 1997, Magic Dirt again performed on the Big Day Out tour. In July, Thomas left and his replacement on guitar was Spanish-born Raúl Sánchez – former front man of Melbourne band, Muffcake. The group began recording its second full-length record, &quot;Young &amp; Full of the Devil&quot;, at Birdland Studios with producer Lindsay Gravina. They followed with a three-week tour of the United Kingdom (where they appeared on John Peel&#x27;s BBC radio show) and continental Europe in the later half of the year. Subway Records in Germany released an updated version of the band&#x27;s US debut, with new artwork and two additional tracks. The group ended 1997 with a new single, &quot;Rabbit with Fangs&quot;, and a national tour supporting Silverchair, playing large arenas around Australia.

April 1998 saw the release of &quot;Young &amp; Full of the Devil&quot;, which peaked at No. 100. The album continued the unsettling, fuzzy sound of the debut, and sold 10,000 copies in Australia. Another single, &quot;She-Riff&quot; was released – in a new and more polished recording – with a video depicting Srsen re-enacting a scene from the 1975 Australian film &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;.

&quot;Young &amp; Full of the Devil&quot; was the last release by the band on Au Go Go Records. Turner and Srsen undertook two side projects. The first was Seaville - a project with Mérida Sussex from The Paradise Motel, which issued the &quot;Swan Song&quot; EP in 1998. The second project was with Ronin System, which resulted in the single, &quot;Expectations&quot; in 1999. Without a label, the band supported themselves by touring throughout much of 1999.

===The East West years (2000–2006)===
====&quot;What Are Rockstars Doing Today&quot;====
In 2000, Magic Dirt signed a recording contract with East West Records, and began recording their third album, &quot;What Are Rock Stars Doing Today&quot; with Phil Vinall (Placebo) producing. Released in October, &quot;What Are Rock Stars Doing Today&quot; reached the top 40. It signalled a dramatic shift in the band&#x27;s sound. Gone were the fuzzy guitars and feedback. In its place was slick production and poppy hooks. Longtime fans of the band weren&#x27;t sure what to make of lead single, &quot;Dirty Jeans&quot;, with its hand claps and sing-a-long chorus. Tracks such as &quot;Pace It&quot; and &quot;City Trash&quot; proved that the band could still rock, however they did receive some backlash, with some fans labelling them &quot;sell-outs&quot;. Triple J put &quot;Dirty Jeans&quot; on high rotation and it reached No. 12 in the year&#x27;s Hottest 100. The year ended with a national tour supporting Powderfinger and Jebediah.

2001 and 2002 saw the band touring in the wake of &quot;What Are Rock Stars Doing Today&quot;. They launched their Love Ya &amp; Leave Ya Tour - the largest the group had done up until that point – which saw them on their first trip to New Zealand. The City Trash Tour with The Nation Blue and Girls Against Boys followed in June–July 2002. They started recording demos for a fourth album early in the year – tracks such as &quot;Love Me&quot; and &quot;Sarah May&quot; from these sessions were later released as B-sides. Later that year, the band made its second trip to the UK, where &quot;What Are Rockstars Doing Today&quot; had been released on Sweet Nothing Records. In 2002, Magic Dirt appeared on the &quot;World of Instruments&quot; segment of &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree&quot;, where they played &quot;Dirty Jeans&quot; using Indonesian gamelans – struck instruments including metallophones and xylophones.

====&quot;Tough Love&quot;====
In early 2003 Magic Dirt started recording its fourth album, &quot;Tough Love&quot;, at Birdland Studios in Melbourne, again produced by Lindsay Gravina. It was released in August and peaked at No. 15. It carried on the band&#x27;s new slicker sound, although tracks like the epic &quot;Brat&quot; recalled the band&#x27;s early days. Originally, no commercial singles were to be released from the album. After the success of the radio-only singles &quot;Vulcanella&quot; and &quot;Watch Out Boys&quot;, &quot;Plastic Loveless Letter&quot; was officially released. It became the band&#x27;s biggest hit to date, reaching No. 34 on the ARIA Singles Chart. &quot;Tough Love&quot; was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2003 for Best Rock Album. It was re-issued in 2004 as two disc set containing their &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; session on Triple J in 2003.

In 2004, Sánchez issued a solo album, &quot;Midnight Woolf&quot;, a self-recorded swamp blues instrumental release on his own Crossbone Recording Company. Sánchez formed the Midnight Woolf band and performed several gigs in Melbourne. In August, Turner produced the debut album, &quot;Peapod&quot;, for Sydney-based group, theredsunband.

====&quot;Snow White&quot;====

In September 2005, Magic Dirt released their fifth studio album, &quot;Snow White&quot;, which peaked into the top 30.
 It received critical acclaim, as a combination of the band&#x27;s pop sound, their noisy early material, and new elements such as acoustic guitars. Lead single &quot;Locket&quot; made an impact on radio and music video channels, but its exposure was limited due to the explicit language in the song&#x27;s chorus. &quot;I Love the Rain&quot; followed as the second single from the album. Neither single charted into the top 50.

Speaking about the album, &quot;Snow White&quot; is far more mellow and less angst-ridden than 2003&#x27;s &quot;Tough Love&quot;. Adalita Srsen told The Age &quot;We&#x27;re growing up more and you let go of those feelings, you&#x27;re over and done with certain things and you don&#x27;t go back there. So there&#x27;s a lot of intense, deep feeling on the new record but it&#x27;s not necessarily coming from an angry viewpoint. A lot of the album&#x27;s about beauty and that&#x27;s what I wanted to do, make a beautiful album.&quot;

Aside from joining the Big Day Out tour again in January and February, 2006 was a quiet year for the band. Sánchez continued his work with Midnight Woolf. He re-assembled the band in Spain for a series of gigs, and they released a second album, &quot;Electric Deluxe Graveyard Blues&quot;. Later in the year, two Magic Dirt tracks, &quot;Sucker Love&quot; (B-side to &quot;Locket&quot;) and &quot;Daddy&quot; (from &quot;Life Was Better&quot;) appeared on the soundtrack for the Australian film &quot;Suburban Mayhem&quot;, plus a track from theredsunband, which had been produced by Turner. Also included were two solo contributions from Srsen, covers of &quot;Sex Beat&quot; and &quot;Double Dare&quot;. &quot;Double Dare&quot; was released as a single in October. The tracks, produced by Mick Harvey (member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, producer for PJ Harvey), were the first solo material to appear from Srsen. Turner, Harvey and Rowland S. Howard also played on the tracks.

===Emergency Music (2006–2009)===
After leaving East West, Magic Dirt created their own label, Emergency Music in 2006. In October, Srsen announced the band&#x27;s future activities, in an interview on Triple J&#x27;s breakfast show. The band would release an EP, a mini-album, and then an album. A report in Sydney street press &quot;Drum Media&quot;, indicated that the EP would be given away at shows and sold in selected independent music stores. The EP featured covers of The Scientists&#x27; &quot;We Had Love&quot; and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;, as well as a live re-recording of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Latest Fear&quot; from &quot;Snow White&quot;.

In 2007, the band embarked on two separate projects; an experimental all noise album &quot;Roky&#x27;s Room&quot; EP and a heavier dark rock mini album, &quot;Beast&quot;. Both were released on the band&#x27;s own label Emergency Music in mid-2007. &quot;Beast&quot; harked back to the band&#x27;s earlier, rawer material and featured original guitarist Herring on two tracks (&quot;Horror Me&quot; and a re-recording of &quot;Sucker Love&quot;). The single, &quot;Bring Me the Head Of...&quot;, made little impact on radio, including Triple J, which had previously supported the band. The group spent the remainder of 2007 touring in support of &quot;Beast&quot;, including an East Coast tour with The Beasts Of Bourbon – who were often joined on stage by Srsen – and Rowland S. Howard.

In November 2007, the band began recording their sixth full-length album, &quot;Girl&quot;, which was released in July 2008. The album debuted at No. 7 on the Australian Independent Music chart. However, it did not reach the ARIA Albums Chart top 50. &quot;Romy&quot;, lead single from the album, also failed to reach the related singles chart top 50. In support of the album, the group embarked on the No Sleep Til Christmas Tour, starting in July and ending in December 2008. The tour included dates in all major Australian cities, and a number of shows in regional centres. Playing bass on this tour was Melbourne musician Matt Sonic, as Turner was too ill to tour. To coincide with the tour, the band released a limited edition tour EP, available only at the shows. The second in a series of tour EPs (the first being the giveaway EP from 2006), the disc featured a cover of Hard-Ons&#x27; &quot;Suck N Swallow&quot;, a collaboration with Gareth Liddiard of The Drones, two outtakes left over from &quot;Girl&quot; and a track recorded at Birdland Studios in 2003.

===Death of Dean Turner and hiatus (2009–2011)===
Dean Turner died on 21 August 2009 of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a rare form of tissue cancer. He was 37 years old. Turner had been diagnosed nine years earlier. After Turner died, the band released a statement:

Following Turner&#x27;s death Magic Dirt performed a final tour in honour of his memory, culminating in their appearance at the 2010 Big Day Out festival. They also released a six-track EP, &quot;White Boy&quot;, in November 2009. Srsen embarked on a successful solo career, while Sánchez formed a new band called River of Snakes.:

===Reunion (2018–present)===
In February 2018, Magic Dirt played a surprise small set at the end of an Adalita solo show at the Barwon Club in Geelong. In June 2018, the band were announced as a part of the 2019 Hotter Than Hell concert tour alongside Spiderbait, Shihad, Bodyjar and 28 Days. The band played their first official show since 2010 on November 18, 2018, at the River Rocks Rehab festival at the Barwon Club in Geelong.

In December 2018, the band were inducted into the National Live Music Awards Hall of Fame as the inaugural Live Legends. At the event, they told the crowd it was the first award of their career. February 2019 saw the band play alongside You Am I at Taronga Zoo Sydney, and in March as part of Golden Plains Festival with The Jesus and Mary Chain, Liz Phair, Happy Mondays and Four Tet. In late 2019, the band toured as part of the Scene and Heard festival alongside The Dandy Warhols, Jebediah, Wolfmother and Eskimo Joe.

The band were scheduled to perform at several festivals across Australia in 2020 and 2021, but many of these were cancelled or rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band later performed at several dates of the 2022 Spring Loaded Festival.

With a large portion of their back catalogue out of print, the band also announced in November 2018 that they would be reissuing their &quot;Signs Of Satanic Youth&quot; EP, on vinyl, CD and digitally, in January 2019. The reissue campaign continued with &quot;Life Was Better&quot; (available on vinyl and streaming services for the first time) in January 2020, a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;What Are Rocks Stars Doing Today&quot; in October 2020, and &quot;Friends In Danger&quot; in July 2021. The reissue of &quot;Friends In Danger&quot; reached number 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, their highest chart entry to date. &quot;Young And Full Of The Devil&quot; was reissued for its 25th anniversary in April 2023, reaching 78 on the ARIA Albums Chart

In July 2022, the band embarked on their On The Road tour, their first headlining tour since reforming in 2018. The tour saw the band play several shows in New South Wales, along with dates in Canberra, Melbourne, Torquay and Adelaide. In June 2023, the band announced a national tour commemorating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Young and Full of the Devil&quot;, playing the album in full. In September 2023, the band released a cover of The Saints&#x27; &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot;, their first new music since 2009, for Mushroom Records 50th anniversary

<doc id="799638" wikidata="Q187635" url="?curid=799638" title="Qutb Minar">
<text>The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and victory tower comprising the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi&#x27;s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It was mostly built between 1199 and 1220, contains 399 steps, and is one of the most-frequented heritage spots in the city. After defeating Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi before the Ghurid conquest of the region,Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated the construction of the victory tower, but only managed to finish the first level. It was to mark the beginning of Islamic rule in the region. Successive dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate continued the construction, and, in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the top parts and added a cupola.

It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of , which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with &quot;superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies&quot; at the top of each stage. In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.

In recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions involving international relations. In September 2023, the monument was lit up in the colours of the Mexican flag to commemorate Mexico&#x27;s 213th Independence Day, an event that was acknowledged and appreciated by the Embassy of Mexico in India. Similarly, on October 30, the Qutub Minar was illuminated with the Turkish flag to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, an occasion that received special attention from the Turkish Embassy in New Delhi.

== Architecture ==
The tower includes elements of traditional Islamic architecture and southwestern Asian design. Elizabeth Lambourn&#x27;s &quot;Islam Beyond Empires: Mosques and Islamic Landscapes in India and the Indian Ocean&quot; studies the introduction of Islam in South Asia and how the region influenced the Islamic religious architecture. These newly arrived Muslims from the Islamic West escaped the Mongol Empire and emigrated to India, where they constructed religious centers. The Qutb Minar serves as a central marker to these new Muslim communities as well as being a reminder of Islam&#x27;s presence in the area. The architecture of the minaret varies greatly from that of the typical style and design of the mosques constructed in the Middle East. The style of these structures is influenced by the local architecture such as the Indic temples. This affected the different materials, techniques, and decoration that were used in the construction of the Qutb Minar.

Historically, tower minarets were uncommon in South Asian-Islamic design until the 17th century, due to the slow adoption of the typical Middle Eastern style in India. It is also detached from the main mosque, showcasing how the native culture affected the design of a Middle Eastern structure. The Qutb Minar is seen as the &quot;earliest and best example of a fusion or synthesis of Hindu-Muslim traditions&quot; according to Ved Parkash in his essay &quot;The Qutb Minar from Contemporary and Near Contemporary Sources&quot;. Like many mosques built in South Asia during this time period, the minaret was constructed by Hindu laborers and craftsmen but overseen by Muslim architects. This led to a construction that synthesized both Hindu and Islamic religious architecture. Since some of the craftsmen were Hindu and unfamiliar with the Quran, the inscriptions are a compilation of disarranged Quranic texts and other Arabic expressions.

==History==
The Qutb Minar was built over the ruins of the Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika. Qutub Minar was begun after the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque. Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, Qutub-ud-Din Aibak and Shamsu’d-Din Iltutmish constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam between 1199 and 1503. It is usually thought that the tower is named for Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who began it. It is also possible that it is named after Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki a 13th-century sufi saint, because Shamsuddin Iltutmish was a devotee of his.

The Minar is surrounded by several historically significant monuments of the Qutb complex. Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, to the north-east of the Minar was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in A.D. 1199. It is the earliest extant - mosque built by the Delhi Sultans. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters, erected with the carved columns and architectural members of 27 Jain and Hindu temples, which were demolished by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak as recorded in his inscription on the main eastern entrance. Later, a lofty arched screen was erected, and the mosque was enlarged by Shams-ud- Din Itutmish (A.D. 1210–35) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra.

The mosque complex is one of the earliest that survives in the Indian subcontinent.

The nearby pillared cupola known as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Folly&quot; is a remnant of the tower&#x27;s 19th century restoration, which included an ill-advised attempt to add some more stories.

In 1505, an earthquake damaged the Qutub Minar; it was repaired by Sikander Lodi. On 1 September 1803, a major earthquake caused serious damage. Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army renovated the tower in 1828 and installed a pillared cupola over the fifth story, creating a sixth. The cupola was taken down in 1848, under instructions from The Viscount Hardinge, the Governor General of India. at the time. It was reinstalled at the ground level to the east of Qutb Minar, where it remains. This is known as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

It was added to the list of World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993.

== The Ghurids ==

The construction of the Qutb Minar was planned and financed by the Ghurids, who emigrated to India and brought Islam with them. The Ghurids, historically known as the Shansabanis, were a clan of Tajik origin that hailed from Ghur, the mountainous region of modern-day western Afghanistan. Between the late eleventh century and the early twelfth century, the different sects of this nomadic clan united, relinquishing their nomadic culture. During this time, they also embraced Islam.

They subsequently expanded into modern-day India and quickly took control of a substantial part of the country. The Ghurids annexed the Multan and Uch in the western Punjab in 1175–76, the northwestern regions around Peshawar in 1177, and the region of Sindh in 1185–86. In 1193, Qutb al-Din Aibak conquered Delhi and implemented a Ghurid governorship in the province, and the congregational mosque, the Qutb Minar complex, was founded in 1193. In the past, scholars believed that the complex was constructed to promote adoption of Islam amongst the Ghurids&#x27; new subjects as well as a symbol of the Ghurids&#x27; adherence to a socio-religious system. There is now new information to suggest that spurring the adoption of Islam was not a top priority of the new annexes and instead the Ghurid governors sought to make a synthesis of the local culture and Islam through negotiation.

== Patrons and architects ==
Qutb-ud-din Aibak, a deputy of Muhammad of Ghor, who founded the Delhi Sultanate after Muhammad of Ghor&#x27;s death, started construction of the Qutb Minar&#x27;s first story in 1199. Aibak&#x27;s successor and son-in-law Shamsuddin Iltutmish completed a further three stories. After a lightning strike in 1369 damaged the then top story, the ruler at the time, Firuz Shah Tughlaq, replaced the damaged story and added one more. Sher Shah Suri also added an entrance while he was ruling and the Mughal emperor Humayun was in exile.

==Architecture==

Persian-Arabic and Nagari in different sections of the Qutb Minar reveal the history of its construction and the later restorations and repairs by Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1351–88) and Sikandar Lodi (1489–1517).

The height of Qutb Minar is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks. The tower tapers, and has a 14.3 metres (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to 2.7 metres (9 feet) at the top of the peak. It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.

At the foot of the tower is the Quwat Ul Islam Mosque. The Minar tilts just over 65 cm from the vertical, which is considered to be within safe limits.

Qutb Minar was an inspiration and prototype for many minarets and towers built. The Chand Minar and Mini Qutub Minar bear resemblance to the Qutb Minar and inspired from it.

== Levels ==
The stories of the Qutb Minar vary in size, style, and material due to varying architects and builders constructing each section.
=== Basement ===
The Qutb Minar consists of five stories of red and grey sandstone. The lowest story, also known as the basement story, was completed during the lifetime of Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, a sultan of the Ghurid dynasty.

It is revetted with twelve semicircular and twelve flanged pilasters that are placed in alternating order. This story is separated by flanges and by storied balconies, carried on Muqarnas corbels. The story is placed on top of a low circular plinth that is inscribed with a twelve-pointed star with a semicircle placed with each of the angles between the star&#x27;s points.

There are also six horizontal bands with inscriptions inscribed in &quot;naskh&quot;, a style of Islamic calligraphy, on this story. The inscriptions are as follows: Quran, sura II, verses 255–60; Quran, sura LIX, verses 22–23, and attributes of God; The name and titles of Ghiyath al-Din; Quran, sura XLVIII, verses 1–6; The name and titles of Mu’izz al-Din; and Qur’anic quotations and the following titles in this much restored inscription: &quot;The Amir, the most glorious and great commander of the army.&quot; This level also has inscriptions praising Muhammad of Ghor, the sultan of the Ghurids.

=== Second, third, and fourth stories ===
The second, third, and fourth stories were erected by Sham ud-Din Iltutmish, the first Muslim sovereign to rule from Delhi. He is considered to be the first of the Delhi Sultan dynastic line. The second and third stories are also revetted with twelve semicircular and twelve flanged pilasters that are placed in alternating order. These red sandstone columns are separated by flanges and by storied balconies, carried on Muqarnas corbels. Prior to its reconstruction and reduction, the fourth story was also decorated with semicircular pilasters. It was re-constructed in white marble and is relatively plain.

=== Fifth story ===
In 1369, the fourth story was repaired after lightning struck the minaret. During reconstruction, Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq elected to reduce the size of the fourth story and then separated it into two stories.

== Controversy ==

On 14 November 2000, Delhi newspapers reported that the Hindu nationalist groups, Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal, planned to conduct a &quot;yajna&quot;, a ritualistic Hindu ceremony related to cleansing or purification, at the Qutub Minar complex where the minaret is located. Delhi Police detained 80 &quot;activists&quot; led by Ram Krishan Gaur who congregated near the Qutb Minar and were stopped from performing the &quot;yajna&quot; inside the tower. Due to a police barricade, the activists instead performed the ritual on the streets outside the mosque complex. Since the &quot;spolia&quot; of Jain and Hindu temples were used to construct the minaret, the right-wing Hindu groups claimed that they needed to perform a cleansing at the complex in order to &quot;free&quot; the Hindu icons that were &quot;trapped&quot; in the minaret and the mosque complex.

On 18 May 2022, a former Regional Director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Dharamveer Sharma, claimed that Qutb Minar was built by Raja Vikramaditya in the fifth century to observe the changing position of the sun, without substantiating his assertion.

On 21 May 2022, the Secretary at the Ministry of Culture, Govind Mohan, decided to conduct excavation and iconography of idols found at Qutub Minar. The Ministry has asked the ASI to submit an excavation report. Excavation can be started in the south of the minaret at a distance of 15 meters from the mosque.

==Accidents==

On 8 December 1946 Tara Devi, a Czech actress and the sixth wife of Maharaja Jagatjit Singh, fell from the tower to her death with her two Pomeranian dogs.

Before 1976, the general public was allowed access to the first floor of the minaret, via the internal staircase. Access to the top ceased after 2000 due to suicides.

On 4 December 1981, the staircase lighting failed. Between 300 and 400 visitors stampeded towards the exit. 45 were killed and some were injured. Most of these were school 
children. Since then, the tower has been closed to the public. This incident triggered the imposition of stringent rules regarding entry.

==In literature==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem, &quot;&quot; is a reflection on a picture by Samuel Prout in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833.

==In popular culture==

*1963: Bollywood actor and director Dev Anand wanted to shoot the song &quot;Dil Ka Bhanwar Kare Pukar&quot; from his film &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Samne&quot; inside the Minar. However, the cameras of that period were too big to fit inside the tower&#x27;s narrow passage, and therefore the song was shot inside a replica of the Qutb Minar.
*2012: The site served as the pit stop of the second leg of the second series of &quot;The Amazing Race Australia&quot;.
*2013: A picture of the minaret is featured on the travel cards and tokens issued by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. A recently launched start-up in collaboration with the Archaeological Survey of India has made a 360o walkthrough of Qutb Minar available.
*2017: The Ministry of Tourism recently gave seven companies the &#x27;Letters of Intent&#x27; for fourteen monuments under its &#x27;Adopt a Heritage Scheme.&#x27; Qutb Minar has been chosen to part of that list.

<text>In mathematics, a set of uniqueness is a concept relevant to trigonometric expansions which are not necessarily Fourier series. Their study is a relatively pure branch of harmonic analysis.

== Definition ==
A subset &quot;E&quot; of the circle is called a set of uniqueness, or a &quot;U&quot;-set, if any trigonometric expansion 

:formula_1 

which converges to zero for formula_2 is identically zero; that is, such that 

:&quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;n&quot;. 

Otherwise, &quot;E&quot; is a set of multiplicity (sometimes called an &quot;M&quot;-set or a Menshov set). Analogous definitions apply on the real line, and in higher dimensions. In the latter case, one needs to specify the order of summation, e.g. &quot;a set of uniqueness with respect to summing over balls&quot;.

To understand the importance of the definition, it is important to get out of the Fourier mind-set. In Fourier analysis there is no question of uniqueness, since the coefficients &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) are derived by integrating the function. Hence, in Fourier analysis the order of actions is
* Start with a function &quot;f&quot;.
* Calculate the Fourier coefficients using
:formula_3
* Ask: does the sum converge to &quot;f&quot;? In which sense?
In the theory of uniqueness, the order is different:
* Start with some coefficients &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for which the sum converges in some sense
* Ask: does this mean that they are the Fourier coefficients of the function?
In effect, it is usually sufficiently interesting (as in the definition above) to assume that the sum converges to zero and ask if that means that all the &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) must be zero. As is usual in analysis, the most interesting questions arise when one discusses pointwise convergence. Hence the definition above, which arose when it became clear that neither &quot;convergence everywhere&quot; nor &quot;convergence almost everywhere&quot; give a satisfactory answer.

== Early research ==
The empty set is a set of uniqueness. This simply means that if a trigonometric series converges to zero &quot;everywhere&quot; then it is trivial. This was proved by Riemann, using a delicate technique of double formal integration; and showing that the resulting sum has some generalized kind of second derivative using Toeplitz operators. Later on, Georg Cantor generalized Riemann&#x27;s techniques to show that any countable, closed set is a set of uniqueness, a discovery which led him to the development of set theory. Paul Cohen, another innovator in set theory, started his career with a thesis on sets of uniqueness. 

As the theory of Lebesgue integration developed, it was assumed that any set of zero measure would be a set of uniqueness — in one dimension the locality principle for Fourier series shows that any set of positive measure is a set of multiplicity (in higher dimensions this is still an open question). This was disproved by Dimitrii E. Menshov who in 1916 constructed an example of a set of multiplicity which has measure zero.

== Transformations ==
A translation and dilation of a set of uniqueness is a set of uniqueness. A union of a countable family of &quot;closed&quot; sets of uniqueness is a set of uniqueness. There exists an example of two sets of uniqueness whose union is not a set of uniqueness, but the sets in this example are not Borel. It is an open problem whether the union of any two Borel sets of uniqueness is a set of uniqueness.

== Singular distributions ==
A closed set is a set of uniqueness if and only if there exists a distribution &quot;S&quot; supported on the set (so in particular it must be singular) such that 

:formula_4

(formula_5 here are the Fourier coefficients). In all early examples of sets of uniqueness, the distribution in question was in fact a measure. In 1954, though, Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro constructed an example of a set of uniqueness which does not support any measure with Fourier coefficients tending to zero. In other words, the generalization of distribution is necessary.

== Complexity of structure ==
The first evidence that sets of uniqueness have complex structure came from the study of Cantor-like sets. Raphaël Salem and Zygmund showed that a Cantor-like set with dissection ratio ξ is a set of uniqueness if and only if 1/ξ is a Pisot number, that is an algebraic integer with the property that all its conjugates (if any) are smaller than 1. This was the first demonstration that the property of being a set of uniqueness has to do with &quot;arithmetic&quot; properties and not just some concept of size (Nina Bari had proved the case of ξ rational -- the Cantor-like set is a set of uniqueness if and only if 1/ξ is an integer -- a few years earlier).

Since the 50s, much work has gone into formalizing this complexity. The family of sets of uniqueness, considered as a set inside the space of compact sets (see Hausdorff distance), was located inside the analytical hierarchy. A crucial part in this research is played by the &quot;index&quot; of the set, which is an ordinal between 1 and ω1, first defined by Pyatetskii-Shapiro. Nowadays the research of sets of uniqueness is just as much a branch of descriptive set theory as it is of harmonic analysis.

<text>Pandit Kumar Gandharva (pronunciation: , Kn: ಕುಮಾರ್ ಗಂಧರ್ವ; 8 April 1924 – 12 January 1992), originally known as Shivaputra Siddharamayya Komkalimath was an Indian classical singer, well known for his unique vocal style and for his refusal to be bound by the tradition of any &quot;gharana&quot;. The name, &quot;Kumar Gandharva,&quot; is a title given to him when he was a child prodigy; a Gandharva is a musical spirit in Hindu mythology.

==Early life and education==
Gandharva was born in Sulebhavi near Belgaum, Karnataka, India in a Kannada-speaking Lingayat family. By the age of five, he had already shown signs of a musical prodigy and first appeared on stage at the age of 10. When he was 11, his father sent him to study music under the well-known classical teacher, B.R. Deodhar. His mastery of technique and musical knowledge was so rapid that Gandharva himself was teaching at the school before he had turned 20. By his early 20s, Gandharva was seen as a star of music and was praised by critics.

==Career==
In the late 40s, he was stricken with tuberculosis and was told by doctors that he would never sing again. He was advised to move to the drier climate of Dewas, Madhya Pradesh for his health. For the next six years, Gandharva endured a period of illness and silence. Doctors told him that trying to sing could be fatal and that there was little hope of recovery. Stories of Gandharva in this period depict a man lying in bed and listening to the sounds of nature around him: birds, the wind, and passing street singers. They also detail how he would hum to himself, almost inaudibly. Hess speculates that this was the beginning of Gandharva&#x27;s radical new conception of the &quot;nirguni bhajan&quot;, which celebrates a formless (nirguna) divinity.

In 1952, streptomycin emerged as a treatment for tuberculosis, and Gandharva began to take it. Gradually, helped by excellent medical support and care from wife Bhanumati, he recovered and began singing again. However, his voice and singing style would always bear the scars of his illness: one of his lungs had been rendered useless, so he had to adapt to singing with a single lung.

His first post-recovery concert took place in 1953. The illness greatly affected Gandharva&#x27;s singing in later years – he was to be known for powerful short phrases and his very high voice.

Gandharva also experimented with other forms of singing such as Nirguni bhajans (devotional songs), folk songs, and with both ragas and presentation, often going from fast to slow compositions in the same raga. He is remembered for his great legacy of innovation, questioning tradition without rejecting it outright, resulting in music in touch with the roots of Indian culture, especially the folk music of Madhya Pradesh. His innovative approach towards music led to the creation of new ragas from combinations of older ragas.

His style of singing attracted considerable controversy. Veteran singer Mogubai Kurdikar did not consider his &quot;vilambit&quot; (slow tempo) singing interesting and his own teacher, Deodhar, criticized some aspects of Gandharva&#x27;s singing, but their relationship was strained from the 1940s when Gandharva married Bhanumati. According to Pandharinath Kolhapure&#x27;s book on Gandharva, Deodhar was against the match. But, the criticism mostly centered on his vilambit gayaki. His singing in faster tempos, particularly his mastery over Madhya-laya, was widely revered.

Vasundhara Komkali, Gandharva&#x27;s second wife and also his student, formed a memorable duo with him in &quot;bhajan&quot; singing. Sometimes, she provided vocal support to his classical renditions. Their daughter, Kalapini Komkalimath, would later accompany both her parents on tanpura.

Some of Gandharva&#x27;s musical philosophy is carried forward by his son Mukul Shivputra and daughter, as well as by students such as Madhup Mudgal, Vijay Sardeshmukh, and Satyasheel Deshpande. The Kumar Gandharva Foundation (Mumbai), formed by his student Paramanand Yadav, promotes the development of Hindustani music and Carnatic music. Gandharva&#x27;s grandson Bhuvanesh (Mukul&#x27;s son) has also made a name for himself as a classical singer.

For a long spell, Gandharva&#x27;s activities as a musician were managed by his friend and tabla accompanist Vasant Acharekar. Acharekar was Vasant Desai&#x27;s assistant in the 1950s but later devoted himself fully to his role as an accompanist to classical singing until his death in the late 1970s. Gandharva had friendly relations with the noted Marathi literary couple Pu La Deshpande and Sunita Deshpande.

Gandharva was a musicologist as well. During his illness, when he was advised complete rest, he spent time contemplating different aspects of music. He had his own thoughts about many different ragas, styles of rendition, and different types of composition.

Gandharva was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1977 and India&#x27;s second-highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan in 1990.

== Personal life ==
Gandharva married Bhanumati Kans in 1946. She had enrolled as a student in B.R Deodhar&#x27;s school, and Gandharva was assigned as her teacher. The two fell in love, got married, and moved to Dewas in 1947. Soon after the move, Gandharva was stricken with tuberculosis, but with the help of new medicines, dedicated doctors, and Bhanumati&#x27;s nursing, he recovered.

Gandharva&#x27;s first son, Mukul Shivputra, was born in 1956. Their second son, Yashowardhan, was born in 1961 but Bhanumati died during the child-birth. Soon after her death, Gandharva married Vasundhara Shrikhande (1931–2015), another of his fellow-students at Deodhar&#x27;s school. Their daughter, Kalapini Komkali, is a noted vocalist.

== Death ==
Gandharva died on 12 January 1992, at his Dewas residence, Madhya Pradesh after a long history of lung infection ailment for decades. He was cremated with full state honors and his funeral was attended by hundreds of music lovers from all over the country.

==In popular culture==
The Rashtriya Kumar Gandharva Samman was established by the government of Madhya Pradesh in 1992 as an annual national honour presented to outstanding talent in the field of music.

The last in the series of four movies in the Kabir Project by Shabnam Virmani features the life of Gandharva and his disciples, his career, and his journey into &quot;Nirgun&quot; singing. His song &#x27;Sunta Hai&#x27; forms the title of the movie &#x27;Koi Sunta Hai&#x27;.

&#x27;Hans Akela&#x27; is a 78 minutes documentary on Kumar Gandharva made by Films Division of the Government of India, with interviews with various people – wife, friends, students.

&#x27;Mukkam Vashi&#x27; is a book made on notes collected during a two-day workshop of the same name. It collected together the thoughts of Gandharva on the nature of music at a fundamental level.

== Legacy ==
In September 2014, a postage stamp featuring Gandharva was released by India Post commemorating his contributions to Hindustani music.

<doc id="799662" wikidata="Q1587638" url="?curid=799662" title="Dungeon Master (video game)">
<text>Dungeon Master is a role-playing video game featuring a pseudo-3D first-person perspective. It was developed and published by FTL Games for the Atari ST in 1987, almost identical Amiga and PC (DOS) ports following in 1988 and 1992.

&quot;Dungeon Master&quot; sold 40,000 copies in its year of release alone, and went on to become the ST&#x27;s best-selling game of all time. The game became the prototype for the genre of the 3D dungeon crawlers with notable clones like &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

In contrast to the traditional turn-based approach that was, in 1987, most common, &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; added real-time combat elements (akin to Active Time Battle). Other factors in immersion were the use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting. Abstract &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters&#x27; skills were improved directly via using them. &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; was not the first game to introduce these features. &quot;Dungeons of Daggorath&quot; for the TRS-80 Color Computer first employed them in 1982. &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; was, however, responsible for popularizing these elements. Other features of &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; included allowing players to directly manipulate objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell&#x27;s effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol.

While many previous games such as &quot;Alternate Reality: The Dungeon&quot;, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Ultima,&quot; and &quot;Wizardry&quot; offered &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-style role-playing, &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; established several new standards for role-playing video games and first-person video games in general, such as the paper doll interface.

As Theron, the player cannot progress past the first section of the game until they have selected at least one and up to four champions from a small dungeon containing 24 mirrors, each containing a frozen champion. The frozen champions are based upon a variety of fantasy archetypes to allow diversity within the player&#x27;s party.

== Plot ==
Many champions have been sent into the dungeon with the quest to recover Librasulus&#x27; (the Grey Lord) firestaff. With the firestaff, Librasulus can take physical form again and defeat Lord Chaos. The player is Theron, the apprentice of the Grey Lord, that goes into the dungeon with the task to resurrect four champions, and guide them through the dungeon, to find the firestaff and defeat Lord Chaos.

If the player finds the firestaff and uses it to defeat Lord Chaos, this will be the real ending of the game. But there is also an alternative ending if the player finds the firestaff and then leaves the dungeon without destroying Lord Chaos.

== Development ==
Originally, Dungeon Master was started with the name &quot;Crystal Dragon&quot; coded in Pascal, and targeted the Apple II platform. Doug Bell and Andy Jaros (Artwork) began development in their development studio &quot;PVC Dragon&quot;, before they joined in 1983 &quot;FTL Games&quot;. It was finished there in C programming language and published in 1987 for the Atari ST first. A slightly updated Amiga version ported by Phil Mercurio was released the following year, which was the first video game to use 3D sound effects.

&quot;Dungeon Master&quot; was ported later to many platforms like PC (including support for the FTL Sound Adapter, a parallel port DAC external soundcard that is compatible with Atari joystick port controllers), Apple IIGS, TurboGrafx-CD, SNES, Sharp X68000, PC-9801 and FM Towns. The game was also translated from English into German, French, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.

According to &quot;The Definitive CDTV Retrospective: Part II&quot; by Peter Olafson, Dungeon Master was ported to the Amiga CDTV but this version was never completed because FTL could not obtain reliable information from Commodore about saving games to memory cards.

A Macintosh version was developed but not released. There exists a prototype for the Atari Lynx under the name &quot;Dungeon Slayers&quot;.

The packaging cover art was designed and illustrated by David R. Darrow, for which Andy Jaros posed as the leftmost character pulling on the torch. The woman in the scene was Darrow&#x27;s wife, Andrea, and the muscular man in the background is unknown, but hired by Darrow from a local fitness club. The painting itself is 25 to 30 inches high and doesn’t contain the word &quot;Master&quot;. Darrow’s painting portrays a scene from the prologue in the manual for &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;. It shows the three (or four) main characters&#x27; last few minutes alive, and is a portrayal of the player’s challenge to defeat the antagonist, Lord Chaos. The heroes in the painting are Halk the Barbarian, Syra Child of Nature, Alex Ander – and Nabi the Prophet who’s been reduced to a bunch of skulls.

A soundtrack album, titled &quot;Dungeon Master: The Album&quot;, was released later. This album featured music composed by Darrell Harvey, Rex Baca, and Kip Martin. The original ST version and its faithful Amiga and PC ports contain no music. The album features music composed for the FM Towns game, as well as FM Towns version of &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot;, and some original tracks that were inspired by the games.

==Reception==
&quot;Dungeon Master&quot; debuted on 15 December 1987 on the Atari ST, and by early 1988 was a strong seller, becoming the best-selling game for the computer of all time; Bell estimated that at one point more than half of all Atari ST owners had purchased the game. Because of FTL&#x27;s sophisticated copy protection, many who otherwise pirated their software had to purchase &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; to play the game.

After unsuccessfully trying to fit the Amiga version into 512 KB, FTL shipped it requiring 1 MB. It was the first prominent Amiga game to require more than the standard amount of memory, likely causing many to purchase additional RAM; at least one manufacturer of Amiga memory bundled &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; with its memory-expansion kit. As with &quot;Wizardry&quot;, many others offered for sale strategy guides, game trainers, and map editors, competing with FTL&#x27;s own hint book.

Hosea Battles Jr. of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1988 praised the attention to detail in the dungeons&#x27; graphics, allowing players to &quot;practically feel the damp chill of the dungeons portrayed&quot;, as well as those of the monsters, including the multiple facial expressions on the ogres. He said the control system works &quot;extremely well&quot; and &quot;one&#x27;s adrenaline really flows because the game is in real-time.&quot; Battles also praised the extensive use of sound effects, uncommon to RPGs. He complained that the manual does not describe monsters or their attributes, of a &quot;frustrating&quot; shortage of food and water replenishments and that the lack of a map makes the game &quot;extremely difficult&quot;. Battles called the game &quot;fantastic&quot; and said &quot;It is a welcome addition to any fantasy player&#x27;s library. Those who want a good fantasy/role-playing game will love this one.&quot; Scorpia stated in the magazine in 1992 that the newly released IBM PC version&#x27;s graphics &quot;are surprisingly good, all things considered&quot; despite the game&#x27;s age, but wrote that &quot;No endgame has ever given me so much trouble or frustration&quot;. Although she believed that the game &quot;is still eminently worth playing, even years later[, and] still has something to offer the seasoned adventurer&quot;, because of the endgame Scorpia &quot;can&#x27;t give it a blanket recommendation&quot;. In 1993 she stated that &quot;the game still holds up well after seven years, even graphically, and is worth playing today&quot;, but because of the ending was &quot;not for the easily-frustrated&quot;.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 1988 called the story a &quot;cliché&quot; but praised the graphics, sound and controls. The reviewer said &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; is an example of a title which &quot;changes the way we think about games&quot; and a &quot;must for all roleplayers&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; called the game as &quot;revolutionary&quot; as &quot;Zork&quot; and &quot;Flight Simulator II&quot;, citing &quot;spectacular&quot; graphics and stating that the game was &quot;almost worth buying for the sound-effects alone&quot;. Despite the &quot;commonplace&quot; story &quot;where once again, an Evil Wizard has taken over control of the world&quot;, the magazine advised readers to &quot;buy this game&quot;. &quot;Advanced Computing Entertainment&quot; said the graphics are &quot;largely repetitive&quot; but &quot;wonderfully drawn&quot; and wrote the &quot;Sound is sparse but the effects are great.&quot; The reviewer called it a &quot;thrilling game with plenty in it to keep you searching, fighting and pondering for a long time.&quot; He summarised the game as a &quot;huge, immensely playable and very atmospheric mixture of role-playing and adventure. If you&#x27;ve been looking for a real-time role-playing game that manages to keep you interested for long periods of time, then your prayers have been answered.&quot; &quot;The Games Machine&quot; wrote: &quot;the innovative character selection system and icon display are both neatly implemented and quick to use&quot;, praised the &quot;superb&quot; atmosphere - enhanced by the spare but apt sound effects - and called the game universe &quot;believable because of its details&quot;. The magazine praised the color and clarity of the monster graphics and the shading of the surroundings. It called the story and setting a &quot;wholly engrossing scenario [which] creates a complete world which can be manipulated at will: its depth fully reflects the two years it took to program it. The presentation - an interesting and evocative novella neither too involved to prove turbid not too short to be unhelpful - is superb.&quot; The reviewer summarised: &quot;Dungeon Master is a role-player&#x27;s dream, but capable of providing a good deal of enjoyment for any ST owner.&quot; &quot;STart&quot; told readers to &quot;be prepared to shed every preconception you ever had about computer games. This is Dungeon Master&quot;. Noting the strong sales, the reviewer called it &quot;a true video game phenomenon&quot; and reported that &quot;not talking to my boyfriend for a week because he lost our master spell list was certainly not an overreaction&quot;.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #15 (April/May 1989), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;This product is highly recommended to anyone interested in fantasy gaming. &#x27;Dungeon Master&#x27; pushes all computers to their limits and will likewise challenge anyone who plays it.&quot;

Kati Hamza of &quot;Zzap!64&quot; said of the Amiga version: &quot;The first-person perspective ensures an incredibly realistic atmosphere - you just can&#x27;t help really getting into the feeling of walking through damp echoing caverns looking for ghosts.&quot; The reviewer also said: &quot;The puzzles are incredibly devious, the spell system is really flexible and the need to practise magic and spells gives the whole thing that extra-special depth.&quot; The reviewer asserted: &quot;This has to be the most amazing game of all-time, anywhere, ever&quot;. In the same issue Gordon Houghton said: &quot;This is just about the most incredible game I&#x27;ve ever seen. When you pick it up you find you lose whole days of your life.&quot; He said: &quot;The best time to play it is late at night in a room by yourself - it&#x27;s guaranteed to scare the life out of you. It&#x27;s like &quot;Gauntlet&quot; in 3D, but about a hundred times better. If you enjoy arcade adventures, RPGs or combat games, but it: it&#x27;s the perfect combination of all three.&quot; Reviewer Maff Evans professed to be little enthused by RPGs generally but said &quot;I know a brilliant game when I see one and this is a brilliant game.&quot; He praised the scares delivered by ambushing monsters and said &quot;you&#x27;d have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to be affected by the atmosphere&quot;. The magazine complained that saving games is &quot;a bit laboured&quot; but praised the &quot;extremely detailed and accessible&quot; controls, &quot;interactive, detailed and extremely atmospheric&quot; scenery and said the clarity of the graphics made the game an unusually accessible RPG. It summarized: &quot;you&#x27;ll be playing for months&quot; and said &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; was &quot;The best game we&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

Also reviewing the Amiga version, Graham Kinsey of &quot;Amazing Computing&quot; wrote that &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; &quot;completely blows away any other RPG on the Amiga market today, and may do for some time&quot;. Dave Eriksson of &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; praised the &quot;brilliant&quot; graphics, sound effects and replay-value and said &quot;&quot;Dungeon Master&quot; is the most stunning role-playing game I have seen on the Amiga&quot;. &quot;Antic&#x27;s Amiga Plus&quot; felt the game &quot;captures the essence of Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing games&quot;. The reviewer praised the &quot;dazzling&quot; graphics, called the user-friendly controls &quot;a real joy&quot; and said the game was the &quot;best graphics adventure for the Amiga to date.&quot; &quot;Your Amiga&quot; called the sound &quot;extremely well done&quot; and said the &quot;most striking feature of the game is the attention to detail&quot;. The reviewer called the game &quot;amazing&quot; and recommended: &quot;If you never buy another game, by [sic] this one.&quot;

Andy Smith of &quot;Advanced Computing Entertainment&quot; several months after its release called &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; &quot;one of the all time classics&quot; and said &quot;What makes &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; really special (apart from the marvellous 3D graphics and eerie sound effects) are the puzzles&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1988 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #136 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars.

=== Sequels and legacy ===
While &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; itself was inspired by early &quot;Ultima&quot; games, it amazed &quot;Ultima&quot; developer Origin Systems&#x27;s employees; Origin founder Richard Garriott said that he was &quot;ecstatic&quot; at discovering the &quot;neat new things I could do&quot; in the game. It influenced &quot;Ultima VI&quot;″s graphical user interface and seamless map, and the later &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;. Game journalist Niko Nirvi wrote that no 3D role-playing title before &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; (1992) could challenge &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; as a game.

In 1989, FTL Games released a &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; sequel, &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot;.

To date, &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; retains a small but faithful following online, with several fan-made ports and remakes available or in development. Notable reception received a faithful reconstruction of the Atari ST version, called &quot;CSBWin&quot;, which was released in 2001. Reverse engineered in six months work from the original by Paul R. Stevens, the available source code of CSBwin led to many ports for modern platforms like Windows and Linux. In 2014, Christophe Fontanel released another reverse engineering project which tries to recreate all existing versions and ports.

The villagers in the sandbox game Minecraft were inspired by the shopkeepers from &quot;Dungeon Master 2&quot;.

<doc id="799665" wikidata="Q2006581" url="?curid=799665" title="Virgin Lands campaign">
<text>The Virgin Lands campaign (; , ) was Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1953 plan to dramatically boost the Soviet Union&#x27;s agricultural production in order to alleviate the food shortages plaguing the Soviet populace.

Hundreds of thousands of young volunteers settled and farmed areas of Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan and considerably changed its demographics. While the scheme was initially successful, later the output decreased considerably, and the campaign had led to an environmental disaster for Kazakhstan steppe due to significant soil erosion.

==History==

In September 1953 a Central Committee group – composed of Khrushchev, two aides, two &quot;Pravda&quot; editors, and one agricultural specialist – met to determine the severity of the agricultural crisis in the Soviet Union. Earlier in 1953, Georgy Malenkov had received credit for introducing reforms to solve the agricultural problem in the country, including increasing the procurement prices the state paid for collective-farm deliveries, reducing taxes, and encouraging individual peasant plots. Khrushchev, irritated that Malenkov had received credit for agricultural reform, introduced his own agricultural plan. Khrushchev&#x27;s plan both expanded the reforms that Malenkov had begun and proposed the plowing and cultivation of 13 million hectares (130,000 km) of previously uncultivated land by 1956. Targeted lands included areas on the right bank of the Volga, in the northern Caucasus, in Western Siberia, and in Northern Kazakhstan. The First Secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party at the time of Khrushchev&#x27;s announcement, Zhumabay Shayakhmetov, played down the potential yields of the virgin lands in Kazakhstan: he did not want Kazakh land under Russian control.
Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and other leading CPSU members expressed opposition to the Virgin Lands campaign. Many saw the plan as not economically or logistically feasible. Malenkov preferred initiatives to make the land already under cultivation more productive, but Khrushchev insisted on bringing huge amounts of new land under cultivation as the only way to get a major increase in crop yields in a short amount of time.

Instead of offering incentives to peasants already working in collective farms, Khrushchev planned to recruit workers for the new virgin lands by advertising the opportunity as a socialist adventure for Soviet youth. During the summer of 1954, 300,000 Komsomol volunteers traveled to the Virgin Lands. Following the rapid Virgin-Land cultivation and excellent harvest of 1954, Khrushchev raised the original goal of 13 million new hectares of land under cultivation by 1956 to between 28 and 30 million hectares (280,000–300,000 km). Between the years 1954 and 1958 the Soviet Union spent 30.7 million Rbls on the Virgin Lands campaign and during the same time the state procured 48.8 billion Rbls worth of grain. From 1954 to 1960, the total sown area of land in the USSR increased by 46 million hectares, with 90% of the increase due to the Virgin Lands campaign.

Overall, the Virgin Lands campaign succeeded in increasing production of grain and in alleviating food shortages in the short term. The enormous scale and initial success of the campaign were quite a historical feat. However, the wide fluctuations in grain output year to year, the failure of the Virgin Lands to surpass the record output of 1956, and the gradual decline in yields following 1959 mark the Virgin Lands campaign as a failure and surely fell short of Khrushchev&#x27;s ambition to surpass American grain output by 1960. In historical perspective, however, the campaign marked a permanent shift in the North-Kazakhstani economy. Even at the 1998 nadir, wheat was sown on almost twice as many hectares as in 1953, and Kazakhstan is currently one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of wheat.

==Yearly Virgin Land performance==

===1954===
The first Virgin Land harvest exceeded expectations. The total output of grain for Virgin Land regions in 1954 was 14,793,000 tons greater and 65% higher than the average grain yield for the period of 1949–1953. By the start of 1955, 200,000 tractors had been sent to the Virgin Lands, 425 new sovkhozy had been created, and a total of 30 million hectares (300,000 km) of land had been ploughed up, 20 million of which were put under crop.

===1955===
The 1955 Virgin Lands crop fell far below expectations due to a severe drought in the virgin land regions, especially Kazakhstan, which received only one-tenth of its normal rainfall. Even though the total sown area in 1955 was almost double that of 1954, the grain harvest went down by 35% from 1954 in Kazakhstan. However, other regions of the Soviet Union had a particularly good year, which offset poor Virgin Land performance and resulted in an overall increase in grain harvest for the Soviet Union. Khrushchev was forced to acknowledge the validity of some of the opposing viewpoints regarding the Virgin Lands campaign but he maintained that as long as two harvests in a five-year period were good, the plan would be a success in terms of recovering costs and making a profit.

===1956===
Enthusiasm over the Virgin Lands campaign dampened after the poor harvest of 1955. Much less new land was put into cultivation in 1956. However, the harvest of 1956 proved to be the most successful of the entire Virgin Lands campaign, and the largest harvest in Soviet history up to that point. Grain output for Virgin Lands regions increased by 180% compared to the average of 1949–1953 and 90% compared to the 1954–1955 average. The grain output in 1956 of the entire Soviet Union was 50% higher than the 1949–53 average. Encouraged by the success, Khrushchev went on a tour through the Virgin Land regions awarding medals to farmers.

===1957===
The 1957 harvest was a failure. Virgin Land&#x27;s grain output decreased 40% from 1956, and 18% for the total Soviet Union grain output.

===1958===
In 1958 and 1959 there was almost no new land ploughed up in Virgin Land regions. The 1958 harvest was a particularly good one, reaching 58,385,000 tons of grain, only 8% below the record of 62,263,000 tons set in 1956.

===1959===
The 1959 growing season was extremely rainy, causing many difficulties. However, the harvest was not disappointing. The Virgin Land crop in 1959 was 54,571,000 tons, only 6% lower than the 1958 harvest.

===1960===
The two good harvests of 1958 and 1959 gave the campaign a new boost of support. 1,648,000 hectares (16,480 km) of new Virgin Land were plowed in Kazakhstan alone. Khrushchev organized one of the most important Virgin Lands regions into an administrative unit called Tseliny Krai, a territory consisting of five provinces in northern Kazakhstan. The capital, originally Akmolinsk, was renamed as Tselinograd, or Virgin Land City. However, the year of 1960 ended up being one of the worst years for agriculture during the program.

===1961–1963===
Productivity of the Virgin Lands underwent a steady decrease following the harvest of 1958. In 1963 Khrushchev began an initiative to widely expand fertilizer production and availability throughout the Soviet Union in order to increase the productivity of the Virgin Lands. The USSR only possessed 20 million tons of fertilizers for 218 million hectares (2,180,000 km) as opposed to the United States, which possessed 35 million tons of fertilizer for 118 million hectares (1,180,000 km) of land. Khrushchev ordered 60 new fertilizer factories to be built. Even so, the productivity of the Virgin Lands continued to decline and never got close to replicating the record harvest of 1956.

==Major challenges==

===Poor living conditions and manpower shortages===
Virgin Land areas were mostly rural settlements with small populations. The incredible speed with which Virgin Land workers were recruited and transported to the Virgin Lands created major housing and food shortages. The poor living conditions caused many workers to quickly pack up and leave within the first months to years of arriving in the Virgin Lands. The number of workers on the state farms in Kazakhstan increased by 322,000 from 1954 to 1957, but in this time only 1,800,000 m2 of housing was built. The people who were attracted to the Virgin Land settlements were young men from poor villages, orphans, and released prisoners because even though the living conditions were poor, it was still an improvement in their lifestyles. While the food shortages in Virgin Land settlements were solved by 1956, the housing problem remained an issue past the end of the 1950s.

As a consequence of the poor living conditions and constant out-migration, there were shortages of workers on the new Virgin Land state farms. Between 1957 and 1960, 24,000 specialists of all disciplines were sent to work in the Virgin Land districts of Kazakhstan, and during the same time period 14,000 specialists left due to poor living conditions. Additionally, the workers who did stay were mostly young and inexperienced, lacking the skills to work the machinery and farm efficiently. To deal with the issue, a decree was issued in Kazakhstan at the end of 1959 that ordered the full-time training of 65,000 new tractorists and an additional 50,000 in off-duty time. However, due to resource restraints, less than half that number received training. As a short-term solution, the government began paying about 250,000 experienced farmers per year from southern regions of Kazakhstan to come to work in the Virgin Lands after they completed their own harvests.

===Machinery and repair shop shortages===
Despite Khrushchev&#x27;s efforts to adequately supply the Virgin Land provinces with farm machinery by sending nearly all newly manufactured equipment and commandeering machinery from other areas of the Soviet Union for Virgin Land areas, there were still major shortages of farming machinery. For example, in Kazakhstan in 1959, there was only 1 tractor for every 218 (2.18 km) hectares of land. The problem was simply that the agricultural machinery industry in the Soviet Union was not capable of producing the amount of machinery demanded by sudden expansion of land under cultivation. Furthermore, machinery parts and the facilities and professionals needed for tractor repair were also in short supply, resulting in machinery going unused even when all that was needed was a simple, cheap repair.

===Climate===
The dryland conditions in the Virgin Land areas, especially Kazakhstan, were not conducive to monoculture farming. The area got only 200 to 350 mm of rain yearly and the majority tended to fall in July and August, when the grain was ripening and at harvest time, whereas drought usually occurred in spring when the immature shoots needed the most water. Furthermore, the vegetation period was short and the area was prone to cold spells and frosts as late as early fall. Strong winds blew snow from the fields in winter and caused soil erosion in the spring. The soil was also characterized by high salt content. The intensive monoculture farming of the Virgin Lands campaign, with 83% of the total cropland in 1958–1959 being covered by grain, depleted the soil of necessary nutrients. This is likely one of the major causes for the gradual decrease in Virgin Land productivity after 1959.

===Inadequate grain storage facilities===
Very little infrastructure existed in the Virgin Land provinces prior to Khrushchev&#x27;s announcement of the campaign. Consequently, when harvesting began there were minimal storage facilities for the crops. This caused substantial amounts of the crop yield to be left in the fields to rot. Furthermore, lack of storage facilities caused farmers to hastily harvest the entire crop during suitable weather, leading to ripe and unripe grain often being mixed together. This raised the moisture content and caused the grain to spoil. The loss of spoiled grain in this manner (referred to as dockage) often accounted for the loss of 10–15% of crop output. Harvests in Kazakhstan in 1956, 1958, and 1959 respectively were 23.8, 21.9, and 19.9 million tons of grain, whereas the storage capacity of Kazakhstan in 1960 was only 10 million tons of grain.

<doc id="799673" wikidata="Q42633" url="?curid=799673" title="Snowshoe cat">
<text>The Snowshoe is a rare breed of domestic cat originating in the United States of America in the 1960s. The Snowshoe is a short-haired bicolour colourpoint breed. Snowshoes were first produced when a Siamese breeder&#x27;s cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called &quot;Silver Laces&quot;, crossing the strangely marked Siamese cats with bicolour American Shorthair cats and other breeds. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing the correct coat markings.

==History==

In the 1960s, a cat owned by Siamese cat breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty produced a litter of Siamese kittens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three of the kittens had unique markings, consisting of white points and feet. Intrigued by their looks, she began working to breed cats like them, using seal point Siamese with bicolour American Shorthairs. The offspring of those cats lacked the Siamese points, but by breeding the offspring to Siamese cats, the desired look was accomplished. Hinds-Daugherty named the breed &quot;Snowshoe&quot; because of their white feet. Hinds-Daugherty promoted the Snowshoe at local cats shows, though they were not recognised at the time. Hinds-Daughtery eventually abandoned the Snowshoe breeding program, and it was taken up by Vikki Olander.

Olander wrote the first breed standard for the Snowshoe, and succeeded in obtaining the Cat Fanciers Federation (CFF) and the American Cat Association&#x27;s (ACA) &quot;experimental breed&quot; status for the Snowshoe in 1974. However, by 1977, Olander was the last breeder of the Snowshoe in the United States. After struggling to keep the breed alive, Olander was contacted by Jim Hoffman and Georgia Kuhnell, who were interested in the breed. Other breeders joined Olander, Hoffman, and Kuhnell, and they obtained the champion status from the CFF in 1983. In 1989, Olander left the program, as her fiancé was allergic to cats. However, by then the Snowshoe had a strong following, and the breed attained champion status with the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) in 1990 and was recognised by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1993. Currently, breeders work to attain acceptance with the Cat Fanciers Association, but struggle with the lack of cats and breeders needed for the association&#x27;s requirements.

Snowshoes are also fully recognised by the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), and the Cat Fanciers Federation.

===Popularity and breeding===
The Snowshoe is a rare breed, partly due to the difficulty of breeding cats with markings and patterns that conform well to breed standards. The Snowshoe&#x27;s pattern relies on recessive genes and other factors to produce desired results. One gene, which causes the &quot;V&quot; facial pattern, is an example of incomplete dominance. If the offspring produced has two dominant genes for the marking, then the feature will be larger than a cat with one dominant gene. However, other factors may influence the feature, which makes it difficult to predict the outcome. Another issue is the white boots, which can be caused by a piebalding gene or a gloving gene. The genes are difficult to control, and many cats&#x27; boots extend too far up the leg, do not reach far enough up the leg, or the cat completely lacks white. As such, pet-quality Snowshoes usually have too much white, too little white, or white features are mismarked. The cats&#x27; body type further complicates breeding, as the breeder must achieve the correct head shape and ear set, while still maintaining the body structure of the American Shorthair and the length of the Siamese.

==Characteristics ==
===Anatomy===
The ear size ranges from medium to medium-large with slightly rounded tips. The head may be triangular, however can be an &quot;applehead&quot; shape with a traditional cat look. The short-haired coat consists of solid and white patterns. Points (ears, tail, face-mask and sometimes legs) are solid black-based colours. White patterns vary, typically falling along the face, chest, stomach, and paws. The body is an even colouration, subtle shading to point colour on back, shoulders and hips; toning to a lighter shade near chest and stomach. Paw pads may be white, point colour, flesh tone, or mottled. Their colour will darken with age, even to the point of turning a chocolate brown shade. The eyes are always blue. The tail is medium-sized. Snowshoe cats come in blue, lilac, lynx, fawn, chocolate, and seal points. The Snowshoe is a medium-large cat and its body longer than other cat breeds, with many males reaching 6 kg (14 lbs) or more.

===Coat===
In registries and cat associations, the recognised Snowshoe coat color is point coloration, featuring a light body color and darker ears, face, legs, and tail. Unlike standard Colorpoint Shorthairs, however, Snowshoe point gradients end in sharply-contrasting white tips on the paws and nose/muzzle. The ACFA recognises seal (black) and blue point colouration, while the FIFe recognises seal (black), blue, chocolate, red, cream, cinnamon, and fawn point colouration. Additionally, the FIFe recognises the colours in tortoiseshell, tabby, and tortoiseshell-tabby coat patterns. TICA recognises all pointed colours. Snowshoe kittens are born white, and markings appear within 1 to 3 weeks. Each Snowshoe has a pattern unique to the individual cat.

The Snowshoe&#x27;s coat should be of medium to short in length, and should be bright and smooth with no noticeable undercoat. It is considered a fault within cat associations if the Snowshoe has a plush or double coat. The Snowshoe&#x27;s coat undergoes seasonal changes and does not require much grooming.

===Personality===
Snowshoes are generally affectionate, sweet-tempered, and mellow. They enjoy the company of humans and being given attention, and are compatible with children and other pets. Snowshoes are very social and docile, and show great devotion and love towards their owners. Consequently, the cats of this breed dislike being left alone for long periods of time and are able to cope with working hours better if they have another cat companion. The cats are also noted as being intelligent; they can learn to open various types of doors, and can be taught tricks, especially fetch. Snowshoes also enjoy water, particularly running water, and may on occasion swim.

==Health==
In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Snowshoe was over-represented, with three recorded cases out of a population of 16.

<doc id="799679" wikidata="Q576338" url="?curid=799679" title="Imjin War">
<text>The Imjin War () was a series of two Japanese invasions of Korea: an initial invasion in 1592 also individually called &quot;Imjin War&quot;, a brief truce in 1596, and a second invasion in 1597 called the Chŏngyu War (). The conflict ended in 1598 with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the Korean Peninsula after a military stalemate in Korea&#x27;s southern provinces.

The invasions were launched by Toyotomi Hideyoshi with the intent of conquering the Korean Peninsula and China proper, which were ruled by the Joseon and Ming dynasties, respectively. Japan quickly succeeded in occupying large portions of the Korean Peninsula, but the contribution of reinforcements by the Ming, as well as the disruption of Japanese supply fleets along the western and southern coasts by the Joseon Navy, forced the Japanese forces to withdraw from Pyongyang and the northern provinces. Afterwards, with righteous armies (Joseon civilian militias) conducting guerrilla warfare against the occupying Japanese forces and supply difficulties hampering both sides, neither force was able to mount a successful offensive or gain any additional territory, resulting in a military stalemate. The first phase of the invasion ended in 1596, and was followed afterwards by ultimately unsuccessful peace negotiations between Japan and the Ming.

In 1597, Japan renewed its offensive by invading Korea a second time. The pattern of the second invasion largely mirrored that of the first. The Japanese had initial successes on land, capturing several cities and fortresses, only to be halted and forced to withdraw to the southern coastal regions of the peninsula. However, the pursuing Ming and Joseon forces were unable to dislodge the Japanese from these positions, where both sides again became locked in a ten-month-long military stalemate.

With Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s death in 1598, limited progress on land, and continued disruption of supply lines by the Joseon Navy, the Japanese forces in Korea were ordered to withdraw back to Japan by the new governing Council of Five Elders. Final peace negotiations between the parties followed, and continued for several years, ultimately resulting in the normalization of relations.

==Names==
In Korean, the first invasion (1592–1593) is called the , where 1592 is an &quot;imjin&quot; year in the sexagenary cycle. The second invasion (1597–1598) is called the . Collectively, the invasions are referred to as the &quot;Imjin War&quot;.

In Chinese, the wars are referred to as the &quot;Wanli Korean Campaign&quot;, after the reigning Chinese emperor.

In Japanese, the war is called . &quot;Bunroku&quot; referring to the Japanese era name spanning the period from 1592 to 1596. The second invasion (1597–1598) is called . During the Edo period (17–19th centuries), the war was also called , &quot;entry into Tang&quot;, the dynasty whose name is synonymous with China.

==Background==
===Japan and Korea before the war===
In 1392, General Yi Seonggye led a successful coup to take political power in Korea from U of Goryeo. Seonggye&#x27;s followers forced him to take the crown as Taejo of Joseon, thus establishing a new dynasty. In search of a justification for its rule given the lack of a royal bloodline, the new regime received recognition from China and integration into the Imperial Chinese tributary system within the context of the Mandate of Heaven. Within this tributary system, China assumed the role of a &quot;big brother&quot;, with Korea maintaining the highest position among the tributary states, which also included countries such as the Ryukyu Kingdom, Lan Xang, Đại Việt, and the Ayutthaya Kingdom, in return for accepting the subservient tributary role of a &quot;younger brother&quot;.

In 1402, the Japanese shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (despite not being the Emperor of Japan) was conferred the title of &quot;King of Japan&quot; by the Chinese emperor and through this title had similarly accepted a position in the imperial tributary system as of 1404. This relationship ended in 1408 when Japan, unlike Korea, chose to end its recognition of China&#x27;s regional hegemony and cancel any further tribute missions. Membership in the tributary system was a prerequisite for any economic exchange with China. In exiting the system, Japan relinquished its trade relationship with China.

One thousand years earlier, the Sui and Tang dynasties of China had complicated political and trading relations with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Ming China, on the other hand, had close trading and diplomatic relations with the Joseon, which remained integrated in the imperial tributary system, but also received tribute and trade from Sō clan of Tsushima, Japan.

Ming China and Joseon Korea shared much in common. Both emerged during the 14th century after the end of the Yuan dynasty, embraced Confucian ideals in society, and faced similar threats (Jurchen raiders and wokou). Both had competing internal political factions, which would influence decisions made prior to and during the war. Because of close trade and common enemies, Joseon and Ming had a friendly alliance.

===Hideyoshi&#x27;s preparations===
By the last decade of the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the most preeminent daimyō, had unified all of Japan in a brief period of peace. Since he came to hold power in the absence of a legitimate successor of the Minamoto lineage necessary for the imperial shōgun commission, he sought military power to legitimize his rule and to decrease his dependence on the imperial family. It is also suggested that Hideyoshi planned an invasion of China to fulfill the dreams of his late lord, Oda Nobunaga, and to mitigate the possible threat of civil disorder or rebellion posed by the large number of now-idle samurai and soldiers in unified Japan. It is also possible that Hideyoshi might have set a more realistic goal of subjugating the smaller neighbouring states (the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and Korea) and treating the larger or more distant countries as trading partners, because throughout the invasion of Korea, Hideyoshi sought for legal tally trade with China.

Hideyoshi&#x27;s need for military supremacy as a justification for his rule, which lacked shōgunal background, could have, on an international level, been eventually transformed into an order with Japan&#x27;s neighboring countries below Japan. Hideyoshi did not take the title of Shōgun on the grounds that he lacked the necessary Minamoto descent, but since it was very common in 16th-century Japan for genealogists to &quot;discover&quot; that someone had illustrious ancestry for the right price, that suggests that Hideyoshi was planning on creating a new office for himself to replace the &quot;bakufu&quot;. Hideyoshi was also tempted by an external conflict to prevent internal rebellion within Japan, which would keep his newly formed state united against a common enemy, and prevent the &quot;daimyōs&quot; from acting on any ambitions against his rule. Fighting a war away from Japanese territory would also prevent territorial destruction, and maintain the infrastructure of the state. Such considerations would be consistent with the fact that Hideyoshi was not shōgun and had no links with the imperial bloodline.

Stephen Turnbull also suggests personal ambition and megalomania of Hideyoshi as reasons for the invasion. Hideyoshi had, in a series of wars, conquered Japan and now wanted to turn to bigger things, noting that he spoke not only of his desire to &quot;slash his way&quot; into Korea to invade China, but also the Philippines, and India. Furthermore, for thousands of years, China had been the intellectual, economic, military, and political center of East Asia, and traditionally, the states of East Asia had acknowledged the emperors of China as their overlords and paid tribute in exchange for being allowed to trade with China. Japan had usually resisted the demand to pay tribute to China, but shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu had acknowledged the emperor of China as his overlord in return for access to the huge Chinese market. Japan&#x27;s right to pay tribute and, with it, the right to trade with China was ended in the 1540s by the Ming court in response to raids by Sino-Japanese pirates known as the &quot;wakō&quot;.

By seeking to invade China, Hideyoshi was in effect claiming for Japan the role traditionally played by China in East Asia as the center of the East Asian international order. He rallied support in Japan as a man of relatively humble origins who owed his position to his military might. Finally, during the 1540s–1550s, the &quot;wakō&quot; had staged a series of samurai raids into Korea, some of which were so large as to be &quot;mini-invasions&quot;. Hideyoshi mistakenly thought his enemies were weak.

Hideyoshi planned for a possible war with Korea long before he had completed the unification of Japan. He made preparations on many fronts. As early as 1578, Hideyoshi, then fighting under Oda Nobunaga against Mōri Terumoto for control of the Chūgoku region, informed Terumoto of Nobunaga&#x27;s plan to invade China. In 1585, Hideyoshi told the Portuguese Jesuit Father Gaspar Coelho of his wish to conquer all of East Asia. Hideyoshi asked Coelho to send a message to his master, King Philip II of Spain, who was also King Philip I of Portugal, asking that he make his navy available to help Japan (Ming China, Spain, and Portugal were the main naval powers of the time). However, Philip refused Hideyoshi, preferring not to upset China. The defeat of the Odawara-based Hōjō clan in 1590 finally brought about the second unification of Japan, and Hideyoshi began preparing for the next war.

Beginning in March 1591, the Kyūshū &quot;daimyōs&quot; and their labor forces constructed Nagoya Castle in Nagoya, Saga (modern-day Karatsu, Saga, not to be confused with present-day Nagoya city in Aichi Prefecture), as the center for the mobilization of the invasion forces. In 1592, Hideyoshi sent a letter to the Philippines demanding tribute from the Spanish governor general and stating that Japan had already received tribute from Korea (which was a misunderstanding) and the Ryukyus.

As for the military preparations, the construction of as many as 2,000 ships may have begun as early as 1586. To estimate the strength of the Korean military, Hideyoshi sent an assault force of 26 ships to the southern coast of Korea in 1587. On the diplomatic front, Hideyoshi began to establish friendly relations with China long before he had completed the unification of Japan. He also helped to police the trade routes against the wokou.

====Diplomatic dealings between Japan and Korea====
In 1587, Hideyoshi sent his first envoy, , to Korea, which was during the rule of King Seonjo, to re-establish diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan (broken since the wokou raid in 1555). Hideyoshi hoped to use this as a foundation to induce the Korean court to join Japan in a war against China. Yasuhiro, with his warrior background and an attitude disdainful of the Korean officials and their customs, failed to receive the promise of future ambassadorial missions from Korea.

Around May 1589, Hideyoshi&#x27;s second embassy, consisting of Sō Yoshitoshi, , and Buddhist monk , reached Korea and secured the promise of a Korean embassy to Japan in exchange for a group of Korean rebels which had taken refuge in Japan.

In 1587, Hideyoshi had ordered the adopted father of Yoshitoshi and the daimyō of Tsushima Island, , to offer the Joseon Dynasty an ultimatum of submitting to Japan and participating in the conquest of China, or facing the prospect of open war with Japan. However, as Tsushima Island enjoyed a special trading position as the single checkpoint to Korea for all Japanese ships and had permission from Korea to trade with as many as 50 of its own vessels, the Sō family had a vested interest in preventing conflict with Korea, and delayed the talks for nearly two years. Even when Hideyoshi renewed his order, Sō Yoshitoshi reduced the visit to the Korean court to a campaign to better relations between the two countries. Near the end of the ambassadorial mission, Yoshitoshi presented King Seonjo a brace of peafowl and matchlock guns—the first advanced firearms to come to Korea. Yu Sŏngnyong, a high-ranking scholar official, suggested that the military put the arquebus (a matchlock firearm) into production and use, but the Korean court failed to appreciate its merits. This lack of interest and underestimation of the power of the arquebus greatly contributed to the failures of the Korean army early in the war.

In April 1590, the Korean ambassadors, including Hwang Yun-gil and Kim Saung-il, left for Kyoto, where they waited for two months while Hideyoshi was finishing his campaign against the Hojo clan. Upon his return, they exchanged ceremonial gifts and delivered King Seonjo&#x27;s letter to Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi mistakenly assumed that the Koreans had come to pay a tributary homage to Japan. For this reason, the ambassadors were not given the formal treatment that was due to diplomatic representatives. In the end, the Korean ambassadors asked for Hideyoshi to write a reply to the Korean king, for which they waited 20 days at the port of Sakai. The letter, redrafted as requested by the ambassadors on the ground that it was too discourteous, invited Korea to submit to Japan and join in a war against China.

Upon the ambassadors&#x27; return, the Joseon court held serious discussions concerning Japan&#x27;s invitation, while Hwang Yun-gil reported conflicting estimates of Japanese military strength and intentions. They nonetheless pressed that a war was imminent. Kim Saung-il claimed that Hideyoshi&#x27;s letter was nothing but a bluff. Moreover, the court, aware only that Japan was in turmoil with various clan armies fighting each other, substantially underrated the combined strength and abilities of many Japanese armies at the time. Some, including King Seonjo, argued that Ming should be informed about the dealings with Japan, as failure to do so could make Ming suspect Korea&#x27;s allegiance, but the court finally concluded to wait further until the appropriate course of action became definite.

In the end, Hideyoshi&#x27;s diplomatic negotiations did not produce the desired result with Korea. The Joseon Court approached Japan as a country inferior to Korea, and saw itself as superior according to its favored position within the Chinese tributary system. It mistakenly evaluated Hideyoshi&#x27;s threats of invasions to be no better than the common wokou Japanese pirate raids. The Korean court handed to Shigenobu and Genso, Hideyoshi&#x27;s third embassy, King Seonjo&#x27;s letter rebuking Hideyoshi for challenging the Chinese tributary system. Hideyoshi replied with another letter, but since it was not presented by a diplomat in person as expected by custom, the court ignored it. After this denial of his second request, Hideyoshi proceeded to launch his armies against Korea in 1592.

===Military===
====Japan====


At the core of the Japanese military were the samurai, the military caste of Japan who dominated Japanese society. During the Edo period (1600–1868) which was created after the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Japanese society was divided into four castes: samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, in that order. The lord of a land is called a daimyo owned most of the land in Japan, the samurai had the sole right to carry swords and to execute on the spot any commoner who was insufficiently deferential, and were allowed to own horses and ride into battle. Only high-ranking samurai officers were allowed to own and ride horses. However, various studies have revealed since about 1995 that the classes of peasants, craftsmen, and merchants under the samurai were equal, and the old hierarchy chart has been removed from Japanese history textbooks. In other words, peasants, craftsmen, and merchants are not a social pecking order, but a social classification. The standard samurai weapon by 1592 was the &quot;yari&quot;, a spear meant to stab, often with a cross-blade that allowed a samurai to pull his opponent from his horse. If samurai wished to cut his opponent rather than stab, the weapons were the &quot;ōdachi&quot;, an extremely long sword with a huge handle, or the &quot;naginata&quot;, a polearm with very sharp curved blade. The most famous of all the samurai weapons was the katana, a sword described by the British military historian Stephen Turnbull as &quot;...the finest edged weapon in the history of warfare&quot;. Samurai never carried shields, with the &quot;katana&quot; being used to deflect blows. By 1592, the armor of the samurai was lamellae made from iron or leather scales tied together which had been modified to include solid plate to help protect the samurai from bullets. Samurai engaged in psychological warfare by wearing an iron mask into battle with a mustache made of horsehair and a &quot;sinister grin&quot; attached to the outside.

Overall, 158,800 soldiers, laborers, and transport troops (of whom a quarter had firearms) were prepared to take part in the invasion, with roughly a third of the force being armed fighting units (samurai, their attendants, and &quot;ashigaru&quot; conscripts), while the other two thirds filled a support ion (doctors, priests, secretaries, boatmen, and labourers). The following table shows the forces of Gotō Sumiharu, who held the fief of Fukue (assessed at 140,000 koku) on the Gotō archipelago. Family records show he led a force of 705, with 27 horses, 220 of which were fighting men, while 485 filled a support role. The breakdown of the fighting contingent was the following:
* General: 1 and his horse
* Commissioners: 5 with 5 horses
* Messengers: 3 with 3 horses
* Inspectors: 2 with 2 horses
* Mounted samurai: 11 with 11 horses
* Foot samurai: 40
* Samurai attendants: 38
* Ashigaru conscripts: 120

Another daimyō whose military service quota has been preserved in a written record is Shimazu Yoshihiro, whose contribution consisted of:
* 600 samurai
* 300 flag bearers
* 1,500 arquebusier ashigaru
* 1,500 archer ashigaru
* 300 spearmen ashigaru
* 6,400 laborers and boatmen

The majority of the Japanese fighting troops sent into Korea were ashigaru (light infantry), who were usually conscripted peasants armed with spears, tanegashima (Japanese arquebuses), or yumi (Japanese bows). Unlike the samurai with their expensive suits of armor, the &quot;ashigaru&quot; wore cheap suits of iron armour around their chests. The &quot;ashigaru&quot; armed with arquebuses were trained to fight in the European style, with the men trained to fire their guns in formation to create a volley of fire, then to go down on their knees to reload, while the men behind them fired, and the cycle repeated over and over again.

The commander of the Japanese First Division and overall commander of the invasion force was Konishi Yukinaga, a &quot;daimyō&quot; of Uto from Higo Province in Kyushu, chosen as commander of the invasion force more because of his diplomatic skills than military skills, as Toyotomi Hideyoshi did not expect the Koreans to resist. Konishi had converted to Catholicism in 1583, and was known to the Spanish and Portuguese as Dom Agostinho. Katō Kiyomasa, who led the Second Division into Korea, was known in Japan as &quot;Toranosuke&quot; (&quot;the young tiger&quot;) and to the Koreans as the &quot;devil general&quot;, on account of his ferocity. Katō was one of the &quot;Seven Spears of Shizugatake&quot;, a group of seven samurai who distinguished themselves in combat at the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, where samurai had fought one another &quot;mano a mano&quot;, and where Katō demonstrated his skills with a cross-bladed spear with great effect by cutting so many men, whose severed and salted heads were thereafter tied to a stalk of green bamboo and carried by one of Katō&#x27;s attendants into battle. Katō was a devoted follower of Nichiren Buddhism, a type of Buddhism closely associated with militarism and ultra-nationalism in Japan, and his relations with the Catholic Konishi were extremely unfriendly, to the extent that the two men almost never met during the campaign in Korea. Katō&#x27;s battle standard was a white pennant which carried a message alleged to have been written by Nichiren himself reading &quot;Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot; (&quot;Hail to the Lotus of the Divine Law&quot;). The naval commander was Wakisaka Yasuharu, another of the &quot;Seven Spears of Shizugatake&quot;, who had been named &quot;daimyō&quot; of the island of Awaji in the Seto Inland Sea in 1585, where he learned much about seafaring as the island is located close to whirlpools which are notoriously dangerous for sailors. Toyotomi Hideyoshi never left Japan, remaining near Kyoto; however, the idea of conquering China was his obsession, and throughout the war, he refused to accept defeat, treating the war as simply a question of willpower, believing if only his samurai fought hard enough, he could take China. Turnbull writes: &quot;In a tactical sense, therefore, Hideyoshi cannot be considered as one of the commanders, but, as his will drove the whole project along until he died, his political influence cannot be underestimated&quot;.

====Ming China====
The Ming Chinese army was the largest in Asia, with a total of around 845,000 troops. However, in 1592 the Imperial Army was engaged in wars with the Mongols and in crushing a rebellion in the northwest. The Ming army was capable of considerable feats of organization, for example bringing 400 artillery guns across 480 km of harsh landscape to provide firepower against the Mongols.

The core of the Ming army was the infantry, divided into five sections; those armed with guns, swords, archers with fire arrows, archers with ordinary arrows, and spearmen, backed up by the cavalry and artillery. The basic weapons for the Chinese infantry were the crossbow and the arquebus, while the cavalry were usually mounted archers. Chinese infantry wore conical iron helmets and suits of armor made from leather or iron.

According to Turnbull, &quot;Chinese field artillery and siege cannon were the finest in the region&quot;. Chinese artillery was made from cast iron, and were divided into several types, the most important being the &quot;great general gun&quot; and the &quot;folang zhi&quot; (), the latter being breech-loaded artillery guns.

One of the Chinese commanders was Li Rusong, a man who has been traditionally disparaged in Japanese accounts. In Turnbull&#x27;s estimate, he was &quot;one of Ming China&#x27;s most accomplished generals&quot;. Although Li was defeated at the Battle of Pyokjeyek, his defeat was temporary. He was an able strategist who achieved his goal of forcing the Japanese out of Korea, and Japanese accounts focusing on his defeat at Pyokjeyek served to distract from his achievements.

Another Chinese naval commander was Chen Lin, a native of Guangdong who proved pivotal in defeating Japan and defending Korea. After helping win the war, Chen was celebrated as a hero in Korea and China. Chen subsequently became the founder of the Gwangdong Jin clan of Korea, and today, his descendants are spread across China and Korea. Chen was given the nickname Guangdong Master for his naval and military accomplishments.

====Joseon Korea====
Officers in the Joseon Army and Navy came exclusively from the aristocracy, but unlike the militarist Japanese aristocracy trained to be soldiers from their youth onward, for the Joseon aristocracy, scholarship was valued and war was disparaged as something unworthy of a Confucian gentleman-scholar. The quality of Korean generalship was quite variable, with some Korean officers being able and others being men who had not devoted much time to the study of war, preferring archery, writing, practicing their calligraphy, and reading Confucian classics.

At the end of the period of chaos after the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty, Joseon was mainly focused on dealing with the looting of the Jurchen people and Japanese pirates in the north. During the reign of King Jeongjong in 1400, the private army system was overthrown, and during the reign of King Sejo in 1457, a unit called Five Guards () was formed, which continued until the Imjin War. In the early days of the war, Joseon had a conscripted light infantry, standing army, and an elite cavalry-oriented organization, especially Horse Archer. It was specialized in dealing with nomadic looters. However, as the Joseon army was easily defeated in the early days of the Imjin War, the Joseon government felt limited in the Five Guard system and switched to the Five Army Camps system.

Light infantry protected their chests by wearing &quot;eomsimgap&quot; (), which was made of leather over a cloth robe that served a similar function to the gambeson. Scale armour was also used.

&quot;Pengbaesu&quot; (), heavy infantry specializing in hand-to-hand combat, were the mainstay of early Joseon infantry, wearing chain mail or mail and plate armour and armed with a round shield and sword. They responded to nomadic raids with shields and knives in mountain warfare, and in the plains, they formed shield walls to deter cavalry.

&quot;Gapsa&quot; () were elite formations of noble origin. Their armor, &quot;dujeong-gap&quot; (), was brigandine, popular in Manchuria and Mongolia at the time. &quot;Gapsa&quot; were required to have a certain amount of wealth to join, as they were expected to self-fund their operations, including by bringing their own horses. To cut costs, Joseon increased its reliance on &quot;gapsa&quot;, growing the lower ranks, and the number of Gapsa increased to 14,000 by 1475. Alongside this, however, the standing army, which had a quota, was neglected, resulting in falsely stated troop figures just before the war. 

A common misconception, seen in paintings and media made after the war, is that the Joseon army did not wear Korean military armor. For example, Luís Fróis wrote in &quot;Historia de Japam&quot; that the Joseon army wore solid leather armor and European-style steel caps, and some wore cast iron or iron armor. Records of Joseon armor distribution and inspection during the war can be found in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty and the Nanjung ilgi, but no records have been confirmed that the Joseon army fought without armor. This misconception may have arisen from confusion with the Podocheong, a Joseon law enforcement agency.

The standard Korean sword was the hwando, a curved sword commonly used by Joseon soldiers during peacetime, shorter and lighter than its Japanese counterparts. A uniquely Korean weapon was the flail, consisting of a red-painted hardwood stick acting as the handle for a chain attached to a shaft with iron nails. Joseon infantrymen often fought as archers, and a Japanese source from 1592 commented that Koreans were superior as soldiers to the Japanese only in archery, because their bows had a range of against the of Japanese archers.

Turnbull wrote that Korea&#x27;s salvation was its navy. The standard Korean ship was the panokseon, similar in appearance to standard Japanese warships, but larger and with heavy cannons; most Japanese ships had no cannons at all at the start of the war. The famous heavily armored and armed &quot;turtle ships&quot; that were to wreak havoc on Japanese ships were a minority of the Korean navy&#x27;s ships. Korean and Japanese accounts both talk much of the &quot;turtle ships&quot;, but no such ship has survived, and historians still debate about what turtle ships looked like, though most now agree that they were, in fact, turtle-shaped. Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who began the war as the Left Naval Commander of Jeolla Province, was to become the commander of the Korean navy and was described by Turnbull as &quot;Korea&#x27;s greatest hero&quot; and &quot;one of the outstanding naval commanders in the entire history of the world&quot;.

===Military capabilities===

The two major security threats to Joseon and Ming China at the time were the Jurchen people, who raided along the northern borders, and the wokou, who pillaged the coastal villages and trade ships.

This defensive stance within an environment of relative peace pushed the Koreans to depend on the strength of their fortresses and warships. With the transmission of gunpowder and firearms technology from China during Goryeo, Korea improved upon the original Chinese firearm designs, the thunder crash bomb, and developed advanced cannon which were used with great efficiency at sea. Even though China was the main source of new military technologies in Asia, Korea was a manufacturing base for both cannon and shipbuilding during this era.

Japan, on the other hand, had been in a state of civil war for over a century, which had the result of turning the island nation into a very proficient warlike society. When traders from the Portuguese Empire arrived in Japan and introduced arquebuses and muskets, the Japanese warlords were quick to adapt to this disruptive innovation, producing &quot;en masse&quot; the tanegashima matchlock. In the ongoing civil strife, the Japanese refined the drills and tactics to make best use of the new weapon, thus giving them a great advantage over the Korean armies.

Korean cannon were not adapted for effective use on land, and firearms were of a less advanced design. The small arms carried by Japanese soldiers proved to be particularly effective during land engagements and sieges. This strategic difference in weapons development and implementation contributed to the trend during the war of Japanese dominance on land and Korean dominance at sea.

As Japan had been at war since the mid-15th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had 500,000 battle-hardened soldiers at his disposal to form a remarkable professional army in Asia for the invasion of Korea. While Japan&#x27;s chaotic state had left the Koreans with a very low estimate of Japan as a military threat, there was a new sense of unity among the different political factions in Japan, as indicated by the &quot;sword hunt&quot; in 1588 (the confiscation of all weapons from the peasants). Along with the hunt came &quot;The Separation Edict&quot; in 1591, which effectively put an end to all Japanese &quot;wokou&quot; piracy by prohibiting the daimyōs from supporting the pirates within their fiefs. Ironically, the Koreans believed that Hideyoshi&#x27;s invasion would be just an extension of the previous pirate raids that had been repelled before. As for the military situation in Joseon, the Korean scholar official Yu Sŏngnyong observed, &quot;not one in a hundred [Korean generals] knew the methods of drilling soldiers&quot;: rising in rank depended far more on social connections than military knowledge. Korean soldiers were disorganized, ill-trained, and ill-equipped, and they had been used mostly in construction projects such as building castle walls.

====Problems with Joseon defense policies====

There were several defects with the organization of the Joseon-era Korean military defense system. One example was a policy that stated that local officers could not individually respond to a foreign invasion outside of their jurisdiction until a higher ranking general, appointed by the king&#x27;s court, arrived with a newly mobilized army. This arrangement was highly inefficient since the nearby forces would remain stationary until the mobile border commander arrived on the scene and took control. Secondly, as the appointed general often came from an outside region, he was likely to be unfamiliar with the natural environment, the available technology, and manpower of the invaded region. Finally, as a main army was never maintained, new and ill-trained recruits conscripted during war constituted a significant part of the army.

The Korean court managed to carry out some reforms, but they remained problematic. For example, the military training center established in 1589 in Gyeongsang Province recruited mostly men either too young or too old to be good soldiers, augmented by some adventure-seeking aristocrats and slaves buying their freedom, because able-bodied men of the right age, targeted by the policy, had higher priorities such as farming and other economic activities.

The dominant form of the Korean fortresses was the &quot;sanseong&quot; (&quot;mountain fortress&quot;), which consisted of a stone wall that continued around a mountain in a serpentine fashion. These walls were poorly designed with little use of towers and cross-fire positions (usually seen in European fortifications), and were mostly low in height. It was a wartime policy for these fortresses to serve as refuge castles and for everyone to evacuate to one, with those who failed to do so being assumed to be collaborators with the enemy; however, the policy never held any great effect because the fortresses were out of reach for most refugees.

====Military strength====
Toyotomi Hideyoshi mobilized his army at Nagoya Castle, located in the old Hizen Province on Kyushu, newly built for the sole purpose of housing the invasion forces and the reserves. None of the original structures remain, but the castle&#x27;s ruined foundations survive in the formerly separate town of Chinzei, now part of the city of Karatsu in Saga Prefecture. The first invasion consisted of nine divisions totaling 158,800 men, of which the last two of 21,500 were stationed as reserves on Tsushima Island and Iki Island, respectively. The Japanese used a total of 320,000 troops throughout the entire war.

On the other side, Joseon maintained only a few military units with no field army, and its defense depended heavily on the mobilization of the citizen soldiers in case of emergency. During the first invasion, Joseon deployed a total of 84,500 regular troops throughout, assisted by 22,000 irregular volunteers.

Ming troops never numbered more than 60,000 troops in Korea at any point of the war. Over the course of the war, the Ming sent in total 166,700 troops, and also sent 17 million &quot;liang&quot; worth of silver and supplies to Korea (equivalent to about half a year of revenue for the Ming Empire).

====Weapons====

Since its introduction by the Portuguese traders on the island of Tanegashima in 1543, the arquebus had become widely used in Japan. While both Korea and China had also been introduced to firearms similar to the Portuguese arquebus, most were older models. The Korean soldiers&#x27; small arms were hand cannons with a simple mechanism and with either a gunstock or wooden shaft attached. After the Japanese diplomats presented the Korean court arquebuses as gifts, the Korean scholar-official Yu Sŏngnyong advocated the use of the new weapon, but the Korean court failed to realize its potency. In contrast, the Japanese often deployed the arquebus in combination with archery in war.

During siege actions, Chinese deployed rattan shields and iron pavises (large shields), reputed to be musket-proof. The Chinese used a variety of weapons, including the short bow, swords, firearms, early kinds of land mines, and early hand grenades.

The Koreans also demonstrated massive use of &quot;hwacha&quot;—multiple rocket-propelled arrows, notably during the Siege of Pyongyang in January 1593. It had the ability to fire up to 200 &quot;singijeon&quot;, a type of rocket arrow, all at one time. The &quot;hwacha&quot; consisted of a two-wheeled cart carrying a board filled with holes into which the &quot;singijeon&quot; were inserted. Although the Chinese had their own rocket arrows, the Chinese opted for hand-carried &quot;hu dun pao&quot;, or &quot;crouching tiger cannons&quot;.

The Japanese defeated successive Korean armies with a combination of muskets, spears, and swords. While muskets used by the Japanese were superior to Korean bows in terms of penetration and range, the former lacked the fire rate of the latter. Numerous battle accounts from the Annal of Joseon dynasty and various essays, diaries of Korean officials and Korean sword express that muskets alone could not ensure victory. Indeed, ferocious charges of Japanese troops with spears and swords were often more decisive than musket fire. This was because the Koreans were poorly trained in close combat, and lacked battlefield experience and discipline; they were thus unable to hold their line against charging Japanese soldiers. The following words from a Korean military official named Shi-eon Lee to the Korean king discusses this weakness:
The King asked him [Shi-eon Lee], &quot;You have already told me about the low accuracy of Japanese muskets. Why, then, are Korean armies having great problem with defeating them?&quot;

[Shi-eon Lee] then answered,
&quot;The Korean soldiers cower before the enemy and flee for their lives even before they have engaged the enemy. As for the commanders, they seldom leave their positions because they fear that they might be executed for deserting. However, there is a limit to executing deserting soldiers since there are so many of them. Truly, the Japanese aren&#x27;t good musketeers, but they advance so rapidly that they appear right in front of the Koreans in the time Koreans can shoot only two arrows. It is said that Koreans are good archers, but they seldom hit the targets when the enemy is too far away, and are too scared to shoot when the enemy is near because they fear Japanese swords. Archery often becomes useless because Koreans, fearing the Japanese &quot;arme blanche&quot;, can barely shoot. The Japanese are reputed to be good swordsmen, but it is possible for Koreans to draw swords and hold their ground. However, the Koreans seldom do this and merely run for their lives.&quot;

However, another Korean official, Yu Sŏngnyong, claims that the Japanese arquebusiers had undeniable superiority over long distances, which (along with low discipline and combat experience of the Korean army) was the main cause of defeats:

In the 1592 invasion, everything was swept away. Within a fortnight or a month the cities and fortresses were lost, and everything in the eight directions had crumbled. Although it was [partly] due to there having been a century of peace and the people not being familiar with warfare that this happened, it was really because the Japanese had the use of muskets that could reach beyond several hundred paces, that always pierced what they struck, that came like the wind and the hail, and with which bows and arrows could not compare.

Today, the Japanese exclusively use muskets to attack fortifications. They can reach [the target] from several hundred paces away. Our country&#x27;s bows and arrows cannot reach them. At any flat spot outside the walls, the Japanese will build earthen mounds and &quot;flying towers.&quot; They look down into the fortifications and fire their bullets so that the people inside the fortifications cannot conceal themselves. In the end the fortifications are taken. One cannot blame [the defenders] for their situation.

Japanese soldiers also relied on their advantage in ranged combat. One of the Japanese commanders wrote home in 1592:

Please arrange to send us guns and ammunition. There is absolutely no use for spears. It is vital that you arrange somehow to obtain a number of guns. Furthermore, you should certainly see to it that those person departing [for Korea] understand this situation. The arrangements for guns should receive your closest attention.

The Japanese commander Asano Yoshinaga wrote home to his father:

When the troops come [to Korea] from the province of Kai, have them bring as many guns as possible, for no other equipment is needed. Give strict orders that all men, even the samurai, carry guns.

The Koreans seldom employed field artillery, with cannon being mainly used in siege action and for defending castles. There were only very few instances of Koreans employing artillery in the field, with largely ineffective results. Some irregular Korean units with government-supplied weapons fired explosive shells from mortars, but this occurred only in isolated instances. The Chinese were more active in employing field artillery than the Koreans. One of the notable Chinese field guns was the &quot;Great General Cannon&quot;, a large breech-loading cannon with a two-wheeled cart, shooting an iron ball weighing about 10 kilograms. The Japanese employed field artillery only where strategically advantageous in both siege and field warfare situations, often using captured pieces where available.

The Koreans actively deployed their cavalry divisions in action. But the terrain was often mountainous, which was not generally suitable for cavalry. The farmland tended to have many ditches, and it was often barren and lacked grass essential for feeding the horses. In addition, Japanese use of the arquebus at long range and in concentrated volleys negated any possibility of effective cavalry tactics. The Korean cavalrymen&#x27;s primary weapons were bows, with swords and lances holding only subsidiary positions. Most cavalry action for the Koreans took place in the Battle of Chungju at the beginning of the war, where they were outnumbered and wiped out by Japanese infantry. Although the Japanese divisions also fielded cavalry, they usually dismounted when engaged in action, acting more as mounted infantry. While specialized firearms were used on horseback, most cavalrymen preferred the conventional &quot;yari&quot; (spear), but its use was limited by the increasing use of firearms by the Koreans and Chinese.

====Naval power====

In contrast to the Japanese advantages on land, the Koreans possessed an advantage at sea. Because of advanced artillery and shipbuilding technology, along with an extensive naval history against Japanese pirates, the Korean navies fielded highly advanced and formidable ships. By the time of the Japanese invasion, Korea employed the &quot;panokseon&quot;, a powerful galley-type ship armed with cannon that outranged most Japanese vessels. The Korean navy used this naval superiority to disrupt the Japanese logistical network off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. This advantage, however, did not affect Japan&#x27;s ability to continuously reinforce its armies through the supply route from Tsushima in Japan to Busan in Korea, especially once Korean naval bases in the immediate area were neutralized by Japanese ground forces. The Korean navy, led by Yi Sun-sin, would withdraw and re-base in the northern border of Jeolla Province. While not able to entirely prevent reinforcement, the Korean navy continued to harass and inflict losses on the Japanese supply fleets throughout the duration of the war.

As virtually all Japanese ships in the first phase of the war lacked cannon artillery, Korean ships outranged and bombarded Japanese ships with impunity outside the range of the Japanese muskets, arrows, and catapults. When the Japanese attempted to outfit cannon to their ships, their lightweight ship design prohibited using more than a few per vessel, and vessels usually lacked the firepower or range of their Korean counterparts. In order to bolster their fleet, the Japanese considered employing two Portuguese galleons in the invasion.

In addition to a lack of effective naval armament, most Japanese ships were modified merchant vessels more suited for transportation of troops and equipment than fielding artillery weapons.

==Korean military reorganization==
=== Proposal for military reforms ===

During the period between the first and second invasions, the Korean government had a chance to examine the reasons why they had been easily overrun by the Japanese. Yu Sŏngnyong, the Prime Minister, spoke out about the Korean disadvantages.

Yu pointed out that Korean castle defenses were extremely weak, a fact which he had pointed out before the war. He noted how Korean castles had incomplete fortifications and walls that were too easy to scale. He also wanted cannons set up in the walls. Yu proposed building strong towers with gun turrets for cannons. Besides castles, Yu wanted to form a line of defenses in Korea. In this kind of defense, the enemy would have to scale many walls in order to reach the capital, Hanseong.

Yu also pointed out how efficient the Japanese Army was, since it took them only one month to reach Hanseong, and how well-organized the Japanese were. He noted how the Japanese moved their units in complex maneuvers, often weakening their enemy with the use of arquebuses, then attacking with melee weapons.

===Military Training Agency===
King Seonjo and the Korean court finally began to reform the military. In September 1593, the Military Training Agency (, alternately translated as Military Training Command) was established. The agency carefully divided the army into units and companies. Within the companies were squads of archers, arquebusiers, swordsmen, and spear infantry. The agency set up divisional units in each region of Korea and garrisoned battalions at castles. The agency, which originally had less than 80 troops, soon grew to about 10,000.

One of the most important changes was that both upper-class citizens and slaves were subject to the draft. All males had to enter military service to be trained and familiarized with weapons.

It was also around this time that the military officer and military scholar Han Gyo () wrote the martial arts manual &quot;Muyejebo&quot;, based on the book &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot; by the famous Chinese general Qi Jiguang.

==Imjin War: Japanese first invasion (1592–1593)==

=== Initial attacks ===
==== Landing of a Japanese army ====


On 23 May 1592, the First Division of the Japanese invasion army, consisting of 7,000 men led by Konishi Yukinaga, left Tsushima in the morning, and arrived outside the port city of Busan in the evening. Korean naval intelligence had detected the Japanese fleet, but Won Gyun, the Right Naval Commander of Gyeongsang Province, misidentified the fleet as trading vessels on a mission. A later report of the arrival of an additional 100 Japanese vessels raised his suspicions, but he did nothing about it. Sō Yoshitoshi landed alone on the Busan shore to ask the Koreans for safe passage to China one last time. The Koreans refused as they had previously done, and Sō Yoshitoshi laid siege to the city. Konishi Yukinaga attacked the nearby fort of Dadaejin the next morning. Japanese accounts claim that the battles resulted in the complete annihilation of Korean forces (one claims 8,500 deaths, and another, 30,000 heads), while a Korean account claims that the Japanese themselves took significant losses before sacking the city of Busan. Jeong Bal, the Korean commander at Busan, was killed by a Japanese bullet, and with his death, Korean morale collapsed. In the meantime, Konishi took the fort of Dadaejin, where under heavy volleys of supporting fire, the Japanese were able to place ladders against the walls, and took the fort. Konishi ordered that no prisoners be taken, and the entire garrison was massacred. Konishi and the First Division then turned north, marching to take Hanseong. The disciplined Japanese brought down a rain of bullets that was lethal to anyone not taking cover. On the morning of 25 May 1592, the First Division arrived at the Dongnae Fortress. Konishi sent a message to Song Sang-hyeon, the commander of the fortress, explaining to him that his objective was the conquest of China and if the Koreans would just submit, their lives would be spared. Song replied, &quot;It is easy for me to die, but difficult to let you pass&quot;, which led Konishi to order that no prisoners be taken to punish Song for his defiance. The resulting siege of Dongnae lasted twelve hours, killed 3,000, and resulted in a Japanese victory. The Japanese took no prisoners and killed everyone at Dongnae, civilian and military, even killing all of the cats and dogs there. Konishi&#x27;s intention was to terrify the Koreans into submission by showing them what the price of resisting Japan was, but he instead stimulated Korean resistance, as ordinary Koreans were enraged at an enemy who invaded without provocation and behaved so brutally.

After taking Dongnae, Konishi took the castle of Miryang, which he followed up by taking Daegu, which surrendered without opposition as the Koreans were concentrating their army further north. Having crossed the Nakdong River, Konishi learned that the Koreans were concentrating their troops at Sangju. In the meantime, desperate Korean envoys had been sent to the Forbidden City in Beijing to ask the Wanli Emperor to protect his loyal tributaries in Korea by sending an army to drive out the Japanese. The Chinese assured the Koreans that an army would be sent, but they were engaged in a major war in Ningxia, and the Koreans would have to wait for the arrival of their assistance.

==== Occupation of Gyeongsang Province ====
Katō Kiyomasa&#x27;s Second Division landed in Busan on 27 May, and Kuroda Nagamasa&#x27;s Third Division, west of Nakdong River, on 28 May. The Second Division took the abandoned city of Tongdo on 28 May, and captured Gyeongju on 30 May. The Third Division, upon landing, captured nearby Gimhae castle by keeping the defenders under pressure with gunfire while building ramps up to the walls with bundles of crops. By 3 June, the Third Division captured Unsan, Changnyeong, Hyeonpung, and Seongju. Meanwhile, Konishi Yukinaga&#x27;s First Division passed the Yangsan mountain fortress (captured on the night of the Siege of Dongnae, when its defenders fled after the Japanese scouting parties fired their arquebuses), and captured Miryang castle on the afternoon of 26 May. The First Division secured the Cheongdo fortress in the next few days, and destroyed the city of Daegu. By 3 June, the First Division crossed the Nakdong River, and stopped at Seonsan mountain.

==== Battle of Sangju ====
Upon receiving news of the Japanese attacks, the Joseon government appointed General Yi Il as the mobile border commander, as was the established policy. General Yi headed to Mungyeong near the beginning of the strategically important Choryong Pass to gather troops, but he had to travel further south to meet the troops assembled at the city of Daegu. There, General Yi moved all troops back to Sangju, except for the survivors of the Siege of Dongnae, who were to be stationed as a rearguard at the Choryong Pass. On 4 June, General Yi deployed a force of less than 1,000 men on two small hills to face the approaching First Division. Assuming that the sight of rising smoke was from the burning of buildings by a nearby Japanese force, General Yi sent an officer to scout on horseback. However, as he neared a bridge, the officer was ambushed by Japanese musket fire from below the bridge, and was beheaded. The Korean troops, watching him fall, were greatly demoralized. Soon the Japanese began the Battle of Sangju with their arquebuses. The Koreans replied with their arrows, which fell short of their targets. The Japanese forces, having been divided into three, attacked the Korean lines from both the front and the two flanks. The battle ended with General Yi Il&#x27;s retreat and 700 Korean casualties.

==== Battle of Chungju ====
General Yi Il then planned to use the Joryeong pass, the only path through the western end of the Sobaek mountain range, to check the Japanese advance. However, another commander appointed by the Joseon government, Sin Rip, had arrived in the area with a cavalry division and moved 100,000 combined troops to the Chungju fortress located above Joryeong pass. Rather than face a siege, Sin Rip decided to fight a battle in the open fields of Tangeumdae, which he felt ideal for the deployment of his cavalry unit. Since the cavalry consisted mostly of new recruits, however, Sin Rip was concerned that his troops may easily be tempted to flee the battle. As a result, he felt the need to trap his forces in the triangular area formed by the convergence of the Tancheon and Han rivers in the shape of a &quot;Y&quot;. This field, however, was dotted with flooded rice paddies and was generally not suitable for cavalry action.

On 5 June 1592, the First Division of approximately 18,000 men led by Konishi Yukinaga left Sangju and reached an abandoned fortress at Mungyeong by nightfall. The next day, the First Division arrived at Tangeumdae in the early afternoon, where they faced the Korean cavalry unit at the Battle of Chungju. Konishi divided his forces into three and attacked with arquebuses from both flanks as well as the front. The Korean arrows fell short of the Japanese troops, which were beyond their range, and General Sin&#x27;s two charges failed to break the Japanese lines. General Sin then killed himself in the river, and the Koreans that tried to escape by the river either drowned or were decapitated by the pursuing Japanese.

=== Capture of Hanseong ===
The Second Division, led by Katō Kiyomasa, arrived at Chungju, with the Third Division camped not far behind. There, Katō expressed his anger against Konishi Yukinaga for not waiting at Busan as planned, and attempting to take all of the glory for himself; Nabeshima Naoshige then proposed a compromise of dividing the Japanese troops into two separate groups to follow two different routes to Hanseong (the capital and present-day Seoul), and allowing Katō Kiyomasa to choose the route that the Second Division would take to reach Hanseong. The division of the Japanese forces was mainly due to the rivalry between Katō and Konishi, but there was a certain &quot;strategic merit&quot; in dividing their forces in that Katō&#x27;s advance into northeastern Korea would protect the Japanese from any attempt by the Jurchen leader Nurhaci to attack their eastern flank. However, the division of the Japanese forces also meant that Konishi would have to take on the Chinese alone when their army arrived in Korea.

The two divisions began the race to capture Hanseong on 8 June, and Katō took the shorter route across the Han River while Konishi went further upstream where smaller waters posed a lesser barrier. Konishi arrived at Hanseong first, on 10 June, while the Second Division was halted at the river with no boats with which to cross. The First Division found the castle undefended with its gates tightly locked, as King Seonjo had fled the day before. The Japanese broke into a small floodgate, located in the castle wall, and opened the capital city&#x27;s gate from within. Katō&#x27;s Second Division arrived at the capital the next day (having taken the same route as the First Division), and the Third and Fourth Divisions the day after. Meanwhile, the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Divisions had landed on Busan, with the Ninth Division kept in reserve on the island of Iki.

Parts of Hanseong had already been looted and torched, including bureaus holding the slave records and weapons, and they were already abandoned by its inhabitants. General Gim Myeong-won, in charge of the defenses along the Han River, had retreated. The king&#x27;s subjects stole the animals in the royal stables and fled before him, leaving their king to rely on farm animals. In every village, the king&#x27;s party was met by inhabitants, lined up by the road, grieving that their king was abandoning them, and neglecting their duty of paying homage. Parts of the southern shore of the Imjin River were burnt to deprive the Japanese troops of materials with which to make their crossing, and General Gim Myeong-won deployed 12,000 troops at five points along the river.

=== Japanese campaigns in the north ===
==== Crossing of the Imjin River ====

While the First Division rested in Hanseong (present-day Seoul), the Second Division began heading north, only to be delayed for two weeks by the Imjin River. The Japanese sent a message to the Koreans on the other bank requesting them to open the way to China, but the Koreans rejected this. Afterwards, the Japanese commanders withdrew their main forces to the safety of the Paju fortress. The Koreans saw this as a retreat, and 13,000 Korean troops launched an attack at dawn against the remaining Japanese troops on the southern shore of the Imjin River. The main Japanese body counterattacked against the isolated Korean troops, and acquired their boats. The Korean troops under General Gim Myeong-won retreated with heavy losses to the Kaesong fortress.

==== Distribution of Japanese forces in 1592 ====
With the Kaesong castle having been sacked shortly after General Gim Myeong-won retreated to Pyongyang, the Japanese troops divided their objectives: the First Division would pursue the Korean king in Pyongan Province in the north (where Pyongyang is located); the Second Division would attack Hamgyong Province in the northeastern part of Korea; the Sixth Division would attack Jeolla Province at the southwestern tip of the peninsula; the Fourth Division would secure Gangwon Province in the mid-eastern part of the peninsula; and the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Divisions would stabilize the following provinces respectively: Hwanghae Province (below Pyongan Province), Chungcheong Province (below Gyeonggi Province); Gyeongsang Province (in the southeast where the Japanese first had landed); and Gyeonggi Province (where the capital city is located).

==== Capture of Pyongyang ====
The First Division under Konishi Yukinaga proceeded northward, and sacked Pyongsan, Sŏhŭng, Pungsan, Hwangju, and Chunghwa along the way. At Chunghwa, the Third Division under Kuroda Nagamasa joined the First, and continued to the city of Pyongyang located behind the Taedong River. A total of 10,000 Korean troops guarded the city against the 30,000 advancing Japanese. They were led by various commanders, including the Generals Yi Il and Gim Myeong-won, and their defense preparations had assured that no boats were available for Japanese use.

At night, the Koreans silently crossed the river and launched a successful surprise attack against the Japanese encampment. However, this alerted the rest of the Japanese army, which attacked the rear of the Korean positions and destroyed the remaining reinforcements crossing the river. The remainder of the Korean troops then retreated back to Pyongyang, and the Japanese troops gave up their pursuit of the Koreans to observe the manner in which the Koreans had crossed the river.

The next day, using what they had learned from observing the retreating Korean troops, the Japanese began sending troops to the other shore over the shallow points in the river, in a systematic manner, and at this sight the Koreans abandoned the city overnight. On 20 July 1592, the First and Third Divisions entered the deserted city of Pyongyang. In the city, they managed to capture 100,000 tons of military supplies and grain.

==== Campaigns in Gangwon Province ====

The Fourth Division, under the command of Mōri Yoshinari, set out eastward from the capital city of Hanseong in July, and captured a series of fortresses along the eastern coast from Anbyon to Samcheok. The division then turned inward to capture Jeongseon, Yeongwol, and Pyeongchang, and settled down at the provincial capital of Wonju. There, Mōri Yoshinari established a civil administration, systematized social ranks according to the Japanese model, and conducted land surveys. Shimazu Yoshihiro, one of the generals in the Fourth Division, arrived at Gangwon Province late, due to the Umekita uprising, and finished the campaign by securing Chuncheon.

==== Campaigns in Hamgyong Province and Manchuria ====

Katō Kiyomasa, leading the Second Division of more than 20,000 men, crossed the peninsula to Anbyon County with a ten-day march, and swept north along the eastern coast. Among the castles captured was Hamhung, the provincial capital of Hamgyong Province. There, a part of the Second Division was assigned to defense and civil administration.

The rest of the division, 10,000 men, continued north, and fought a battle on 23 August against the southern and northern Hamgyong armies under the command of Yi Yong at Songjin. A Korean cavalry division took advantage of the open field at Songjin, and pushed the Japanese forces into a grain storehouse. There, the Japanese barricaded themselves with bales of rice, and successfully repelled a formation charge from the Korean forces with their arquebuses. While the Koreans planned to renew the battle in the morning, Katō Kiyomasa ambushed them at night. The Second Division completely surrounded the Korean forces, with the exception of an opening leading to a swamp. Those that fled were trapped and slaughtered in the swamp.

The Koreans who fled gave alarm to the other garrisons, allowing the Japanese troops to easily capture Kilju County, Myongchon County, and Kyongsong County. The Second Division then turned inland through Puryong County toward Hoeryong, where two Korean princes had taken refuge. On 30 August 1592, the Second Division entered Hoeryong, where Katō Kiyomasa received the Korean princes and the provincial governor, Yu Yong-rip, these having already been captured by the local inhabitants. Shortly afterward, a Korean warrior band handed over the head of an anonymous Korean general, plus General Han Kuk-ham, tied up in ropes.

Katō Kiyomasa then decided to attack a nearby Jurchen castle across the Tumen River in Manchuria to test his troops against the &quot;barbarians&quot;, as the Koreans called the Jurchens (&quot;Orangkae&quot; in Korean and &quot;Orangai&quot;, both derived from the Mongol term Uriankhai &quot;forest barbarian&quot;). Kato&#x27;s army of 8,000 was joined by 3,000 Koreans at Hamgyong Province, because the Jurchens periodically raided across the border. Soon the combined force sacked the castle, and camped near the border; after the Koreans left for home, the Japanese troops suffered a retaliatory assault from the Jurchens. Katō Kiyomasa retreated with his forces to avoid heavy losses. Because of this invasion, rising Jurchen leader Nurhaci offered military assistance to the Joseon and Ming in the war. However, the offer was refused by both countries, particularly Joseon, saying that it would be disgraceful to accept assistance from the &quot;Barbarians&quot; to the north.

The Second Division continued east, capturing the fortresses of Jangseong, Onsong, Kyongwon, and Kyonghung Counties, and finally arrived at Sosupo on the estuary of the Tumen River. There the Japanese rested on the beach, and watched a nearby volcanic island on the horizon that they mistook as Mount Fuji. After the tour, the Japanese continued their previous efforts to bureaucratize and administer the province, and allowed several garrisons to be handled by the Koreans themselves.

Despite these measures, Katō Kiyomasa failed to maintain control of Hamgyeong Island. Because he encountered constant resistance except where his main force was located, Katō dispersed his troops by the hundreds in order to prove to Hideyoshi that he was in control of the occupied territory. This tactic, not used by other daimyo, proved to be his undoing.

The cold and rough land of Hamgyongdo made it difficult for Japanese troops from the warmer southwestern regions to withstand Korean assaults and supply their troops. Unable to solve these problems, Kiyomasa Katō abandoned his ban on looting, provoking resistance from the Koreans. In response, on 20 October 1592, Jeong Mun-bu, an officer in Hamgyongdo, recruited men and reassembled the scattered government troops. With the support of the people of Hamgyong Province, the 3500 men easily recaptured Kyongsong, Hoeryong and Puryong and executed those who were collaborating with the Japanese, greatly spreading the movement throughout Hamgyong Province. On 30 October 1592, a Japanese army of 1000 men returning from looting Joseon villages is attacked by 500 Joseon cavalry at Seokseongryeong and forced to retreat, becoming isolated in the extreme cold on Mount Jangdeok. In response, the Korean soldiers set fire to the mountain the next day at sunrise, annihilating the Japanese army.

Even in this situation, Katō was hesitant to send troops or retreat as the tide of battle slowly turned. Eventually, as the situation worsened and the Japanese suffered heavy losses at Jinju Castle and were forced to concentrate their forces to the south, he ordered his troops to guard Kilju Castle and wait for relief. Eventually, the remaining Japanese forces in Hamgyongdo retreated to Kilju Castle, and the righteous armies laid siege to the castle for three months to prevent them from gathering firewood.
In January, Kiyomasa Kato leads an army to retake Hamgyeongdo. 
On 21 January, the Righteous armies launched a mauling attack at Dancheon, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese vanguard but suffering three defeats against the main Japanese army, which was forced to break the siege of Kilju Castle and withdraw, allowing the trapped Japanese to escape. However, Katō Kiyomasa was forced to abandon Hamgyeong Island due to cold and supply problems, and withdrew to Hanyang on 29 February.

=== Naval campaigns of 1592 ===
Having secured Pyongyang, the Japanese planned to cross the Yalu River into Jurchen territory, and use the waters west of the Korean peninsula to supply the invasion. However, Yi Sun-sin, who held the post of the Left Naval Commander of the Jeolla Province (which covers the western waters of Korea), successfully destroyed the Japanese ships transporting troops and supplies. Japan, lacking enough arms and troops to carry on the invasion of China, changed the objective of the war to the occupation of Korea.

When the Japanese troops landed at the port of Busan, Bak (also spelled Park) Hong, the Left Naval Commander of Gyeongsang Province, destroyed his entire fleet, his base, and all armaments and provisions, and fled. Won Gyun, the Right Naval Commander, also destroyed and abandoned his own base, and fled to Konyang with only four ships. Thus, there was no Korean naval activity around Gyeongsang Province, and the surviving two, out of the four total fleets, were active only on the other (west) side of the peninsula. Won Gyun later sent a message to Yi Sun-sin that he had fled to Konyang after being overwhelmed by the Japanese in a fight. A messenger was sent by Yi Sun-sin to the nearby island of Namhaedo to give Yi&#x27;s order for war preparations, only to find it pillaged and abandoned by its own inhabitants. As soldiers began to flee secretly, Yi Sun-sin gave an order &quot;to arrest the escapees&quot; and had two of the fugitives brought back and beheaded; he then had their heads put out for display. Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s battles steadily affected the war and put significant strain on the sea lanes along the western Korean Peninsula supporting the Japanese advance.

The Korean navy relied on a network of local fishermen and scouting boats to receive intelligence of the enemy movements. On the dawn of 21 July 1592, Yi Sun-sin and Yi Eok-gi set sail with 24 panokseons, 15 small warships, and 46 boats (i.e. fishing boats), and arrived at the waters of Gyeongsang Province by sunset. The Japanese had been sailing up and down the Korean coast, looting and burning all of the seaside villages, and did not expect opposition from the Korean navy.

The next day, the Jeolla Province fleet sailed to the arranged location where Won Gyun was supposed to meet them, and met Yi Sun-sin on 23 July. The augmented flotilla of 91 ships then began circumnavigating Geojedo, bound for Gadeokdo, but scouting vessels detected 50 Japanese vessels at Okpo harbor . Upon sighting the approaching Korean fleet, some of the Japanese who had been busying themselves with plundering got back to their ships, and began to flee. At this, the Korean fleet encircled the Japanese ships and finished them with artillery bombardments. The Japanese fired with their arrows and arquebuses, but the Koreans kept a good distance from them, rendering the Japanese fire ineffective. A teenage Korean girl, taken by the Japanese to be used as a sex slave on board one of their ships, recalled:

The Koreans spotted five more Japanese vessels that night, and destroyed four. After one day&#x27;s fighting, Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s fleet had destroyed 26 Japanese ships. The next day, the Koreans approached 13 Japanese ships at Jeokjinpo. In the same manner as the previous success at Okpo, the Korean fleet destroyed 11 Japanese ships—completing the Battle of Okpo without the loss of a single ship. In his report to King Seonjo about his victory, Admiral Yi Sun-sin found the samurai helmets of the Japanese to be rather strange, writing:

The Japanese generals were shocked to hear of the Battle of Okpo, where the Koreans had not lost a single ship, as it threatened to cut them off from Japan. After his victory, Yi Sun-sin found the burnt out remains of countless coastal villages, where the Japanese had enslaved the women while killing all the men.

About three weeks after the Battle of Okpo, Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun sailed with a total of 26 ships (23 under Yi Sun-sin) toward the Bay of Sacheon after receiving an intelligence report of the Japanese presence. Yi Sun-sin had left behind his fishing vessels that made up most of his fleet in favor of his newly completed turtle ship. At Sacheon, the Japanese ships were anchored in the bay below a promontory where the Japanese had set up a command base.

A turtle ship is a vessel of a panokseon design with the removal of the elevated command post, the modification of the gunwales into curved walls, and the addition of a roof covered in iron spikes (and possibly hexagonal iron plates; this is disputed). Its walls contained a total of 36 cannon ports, and also openings above the cannon, through which the ship&#x27;s crew members could look out and fire their personal arms. The design prevented enemies from boarding the ship and aiming at the personnel inside. The ship was the fastest and most maneuverable warship in the East Asian theater, powered by two sails and 80 oarsmen taking turns on the ship&#x27;s 16 oars. No more than six turtle ships served throughout the entire war, and their primary role was to cut deep into the enemy lines, cause havoc with their cannons, and destroy the enemy flagship.

On 8 July 1592, the fleet arrived at the Bay of Sacheon, where the outgoing tide prevented the Korean fleet from entering. Therefore, Yi Sun-sin ordered the fleet to feign withdrawal, which the Japanese commander, Wakisaka Yasuharu, observed from his tent on a rock. The Japanese decided to give chase, embarked their 12 ships, and pursued the Korean fleet. The Korean navy counterattacked, with the turtle ship in the front, and successfully destroyed all 12 ships. In his report to King Seonjo, Admiral Yi wrote: &quot;Previously, foreseeing the Japanese invasion, I had a turtle ship made...with a dragon&#x27;s head, from whose mouth we could fire cannons, and with iron spikes on its back to pierce the enemy&#x27;s feet when they tried to board. Because it is in the shape of a turtle, our men can look out from inside, but the enemy cannot look in from outside. It moves so swiftly that it can plunge into the midst of even many hundreds of enemy vessel in any weather to attack them with cannonballs and fire throwers&quot;. The Japanese followed their code of &quot;Bushido&quot; by fighting ferociously, but the superior firepower and armor of the turtle ships more than compensated. Admiral Yi commanded from his deck, and was badly wounded when a Japanese sniper put a bullet into his shoulder.

At the Battle of Dangpo, fought by Miruk Island, 21 Japanese ships commanded by Kurushima Michiyuki were in the process of sacking a Korean seaside village, when the Korean fleet appeared to offer a challenge. Yi Sun-sin once again followed his usual tactic of coming forward to challenge, then making a feigned retreat with the Japanese in hot pursuit, before ambushing them on the open sea. A Korean girl who had been taken prisoner and forced to become Kurushima&#x27;s mistress, in an interview after the battle, said: &quot;On the day of the battle, arrows and bullets rained on the pavilion vessel where he [Kurushima] sat. First he was hit on the brow but was unshaken, but when an arrow pierced his chest, he fell down with a loud cry&quot;, while the turtle ship &quot;dashed close to this pavilion vessel and broke it by shooting cannonballs from the dragon&#x27;s mouth and by pouring down arrows and cannonballs from other cannon&quot;.
After his victory, Yi Sun-sin spent the next days searching for more Japanese ships, which he found at Danghangpo. Yi formed his ships in a circle while a turtle ship rammed the Japanese flagship, resulting in a melee battle. Yi wanted to annihilate the Japanese, and fearing that the Japanese might land their ships in order to escape, ordered a feigned retreat to bring the battle out to the open sea, which lowered the odds of the Japanese surviving. Yi noted in his report to King Seonjo that the Japanese had given no mercy to Korean civilians, raping, torturing, and murdering without regard to age and sex, and he would likewise give them no mercy. The feigned retreat worked, with the Japanese following the Koreans to the open sea, and Yi wrote: Then our ships suddenly enveloped the enemy craft from the four directions, attacking them from both flanks at full speed. The turtle with the Flying Squadron Chief on board rammed the enemy&#x27;s pavilion vessel once again, while wrecking it with cannon fire, and our other ships hit its brocade curtains and sails with fire arrows. Furious flames burst out and the enemy commander fell dead from an arrow hit&quot;. All but one of the Japanese ships were taken or sunk, and Yi Sun-sin sent King Seonjo the salted heads of 43 samurai officers. The next day, the one Japanese ship that had escaped was confronted by a Korean ship sent to capture it, leading to a savage fight when the Koreans boarded the Japanese ship. The captain of the Japanese ship &quot;stood alone holding a long sword in his hand and fought to the last without fear&quot;, taking 10 arrows to kill him. All 88 sailors of the Japanese ship were killed, and Yi had their ears cut off to be &quot;salted and packed in a box for shipment to the court&quot;.

==== Battle of Hansan Island ====

In response to the Korean navy&#x27;s success, Toyotomi Hideyoshi recalled three commanders from land-based activities: Wakisaka Yasuharu, Katō Yoshiaki, and Kuki Yoshitaka. Hideyoshi understood that if the Koreans won command of the sea, this would be the end of the invasion of Korea, and ordered the destruction of the Korean fleet, with Yi Sun Sin&#x27;s head to be brought to him. Kuki, a former pirate, had the most naval experience, while Katō Yoshiaki was one of the &quot;Seven Spears of Shizugatake&quot;. However, the commanders arrived in Busan nine days before Hideyoshi&#x27;s order was actually issued, and assembled a squadron to counter the Korean navy. Eventually, Wakisaka completed his preparations, and his eagerness to win military honor pushed him to launch an attack against the Koreans without waiting for the other commanders to finish.

The combined Korean navy of 53 ships, under the commands of Yi Sun-sin and Yi Eok-gi, was carrying out a search-and-destroy operation because the Japanese troops on land were advancing into Jeolla Province. Jeolla Province was the only Korean territory to be untouched by major military action, and served as home for the three commanders and the only active Korean naval force. The Korean navy considered it best to destroy naval support for the Japanese to reduce the effectiveness of the enemy ground troops.

On 13 August 1592, the Korean fleet sailing from Miruk Island at Battle of Dangpo received local intelligence that a large Japanese fleet was nearby. After surviving a storm, the Korean fleet had anchored off Dangpo, where a local man appeared on the beach with the news that the Japanese fleet had just entered the narrow strait of Gyeonnaeryang that divided Koje Island. The following morning, the Korean fleet spotted the Japanese fleet of 82 vessels anchored in the straits of Gyeonnaeryang. Due to the narrowness of the strait and the hazard posed by the underwater rocks, Yi Sun-sin sent six ships as bait to lure out 63 Japanese vessels into the wider sea. The Japanese fleet pursued and, once in the open water, was surrounded by the Korean fleet in a semicircular formation, called a &quot;crane wing&quot; by Yi Sun-sin. With at least three turtle ships (two of which were newly completed) spearheading the clash against the Japanese fleet, the Korean vessels fired volleys of cannonballs into the Japanese formation. The Korean ships then engaged in a free-for-all battle with the Japanese ships, maintaining enough distance to prevent the Japanese from boarding; Yi Sun-sin permitted melee combats only against severely damaged Japanese ships. During the battle, the Korean navy made use of a metal-cased fire bomb that caused substantial damage to Japanese deck crews, and caused fierce fires on board their ships. According to the &quot;Wakizaka ki&quot;:&quot;A man called Manabe Samanosuke was a ship&#x27;s captain that day, and the ship he was on was set on fire. This tormented him, and saying that he could face meeting the other samurai in the army again, committed suicide and died&quot;. Yi noted that &quot;countless numbers of Japanese were hit by arrows and fell dead into the water&quot;, but also complained that &quot;...about four hundred exhausted Japanese, finding no way to escape, deserted their boats and fled ashore&quot;.

The battle ended in a Korean victory, with Japanese losses of 59 ships—47 destroyed and 12 captured. Not a single Korean ship was lost during the battle. Several Korean prisoners of war were rescued by the Korean soldiers throughout the fight. Wakisaka Yasuharu escaped due to the speed of his flagship. When the news of the defeat at the Battle of Hansan Island reached Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he ordered that the Japanese invasion forces to cease all further naval operations.

==== Battle of Angolpo and Danghangpo ====

For two days after the battle at Dangpo, Yi Eok-gi, with his fleet, joined Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun, and participated in a search for enemy vessels around Geojedo island and the mainland cost. The admirals then received intelligence that a group of Japanese ships, including those that escaped from the Battle of Dangpo, was anchored in the Bay of Danghangpo. After sending in a scout, the fleet advanced to find 26 enemy ships anchored along the shore. Unable to form a line in the small bay, the Korean fleet formed a circle with the turtle ship in front and bombarded the Japanese. Realizing that they would likely abandon their ships and flee inland, Yi Sun-sin ordered a feigned retreat to draw the Japanese forces out of the bay and into open water. The Japanese took the bait and followed them, and were cut off. All the Japanese ships were sunk or burned, and only a few survivors managed to swim to shore and escape.

On 16 August 1592, Yi Sun-sin led their fleet to the harbor of Angolpo, where 42 Japanese vessels were docked, in the Battle of Angolpo. After a false retreat bore no response, he arranged a relay of ships to keep up a rolling bombardment. When only a few Japanese ships were left undamaged, Yi pulled his fleet back and allowed them to escape by sea, thereby protecting the inhabitants of local villages from possible reprisals by Japanese forces stranded on land.

==== Battle of Busan ====
A naval engagement took place on 1 September 1592, during the first phase of the Japanese invasions of Korea. It was a Korean surprise attack on the fleet of Toyotomi Hideyoshi stationed at Busan. Over the course of the battle, Japanese forces lost 100 ships while no Korean ships were lost. Officer and six Korean soldiers, as well as countless Japanese soldiers, were killed. However, ultimately, the Korean fleet retreated, failing to take over Busan. In the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (a Korean official history, written by a bureaucrat of the Korean government located in Hanyang District), it is recorded that the Korean navy failed to defeat the Japanese at Busan. However, in other primary historical sources, such as the official Joseon compendium (李忠武公全書) written by Joseon bureaucrats, and the War Diary of Yi Sun-sin and his military reports, it is recorded as a decisive Korean victory. Modern historians have also summarized the battle as a decisive Korean victory. Some Korean historians believe the War Diary of Yi Sun-sin more than the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty when they study the Imjin war because he was the on-scene commander.

After the battle, the Korean government promoted Yi to &quot;Samdo Sugun Tongjesa&quot;, which was the title for the commander of the Korean Navy until 1896.

=== Korean militias ===
From the beginning of the war, the Koreans organized militias that they called &quot;righteous armies&quot; () to resist the Japanese invasion. These fighting bands were raised throughout the country, and participated in battles, guerilla raids, sieges, and the transportation and construction of wartime necessities.

There were three main types of Korean &quot;righteous army&quot; militias during the war: the surviving and leaderless Korean regular soldiers, the patriotic &quot;yangbans&quot; (aristocrats) and commoners, and Buddhist monks. By the summer of 1592, there were about 22,200 Korean guerrillas serving the Righteous Army, who tied up much of the Japanese force.

During the first invasion, Jeolla Province remained the only untouched area on the Korean peninsula. In addition to the successful patrols of the sea by Yi Sun-sin, the activities of volunteer forces pressured the Japanese troops to avoid the province in favour of other priorities.

==== Gwak Jae-u&#x27;s campaigns along the Nakdong River ====
Gwak Jae-u was a famous leader in the Korean militia movement, the first to form a resistance group against the Japanese invaders. He was a land-owner in the town of Uiryeong, situated by the Nam River in Gyeongsang Province. In Korea, Gwak is remembered as an enigmatic, romantic hero. As the Korean regulars abandoned the town and an attack seemed imminent, Gwak organized 50 townsmen. However, the Third Division went from Changwon straight toward Seongju. When Gwak used abandoned government stores to supply his army, the Gyeongsang Province Governor, Kim Su, branded Gwak&#x27;s group as rebels, and ordered that it be disbanded. When Gwak asked for help from other landowners, and sent a direct appeal to the king, the governor sent troops against Gwak, in spite of having enough troubles already with the Japanese. However, an official from the capital city then arrived to raise troops in the province, and, since the official lived nearby and actually knew him, he saved Gwak from troubles with the governor.

Gwak Jae-u deployed his troops in guerilla warfare under the cover of the tall reeds on the union of the Nakdong and the Nam rivers. This strategy prevented Japanese forces from gaining easy access to Jeolla Province where Yi Sun-sin and his fleet were stationed.

==== Battle of Uiryeong/Chongjin ====
The Sixth Division, under the command of Kobayakawa Takakage, was in charge of conquering Jeolla Province. The Sixth Division marched to Seongju through the established Japanese route (i.e. the Third Division, above), and cut left to Geumsan in Chungcheong Province, which Kobayakawa secured as his starting base for his invasion of the province.

Ankokuji Ekei, a former Buddhist monk made into a general due to his role in the negotiations between Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, led the units of the Sixth Division charged with the invasion of Jeolla Province. The units began their march to Uiryeong at Changwon, and arrived at the Nam River. Ankokuji&#x27;s scouts planted meters measuring the river&#x27;s depths so that the entire squadron could cross the river. Overnight, the Korean militiamen moved the meters into the deeper parts of the river. As the Japanese troops began to cross, the militia of Gwak Jae-u ambushed them, and caused them heavy losses. In the end, to advance into Jeolla Province, Ankokuji&#x27;s men had to try going north around the insecure grounds and within the security of the Japanese-garrisoned fortresses. At Kaenyong, Ankokuji&#x27;s target was changed to Geochang, to be taken with the aid of Kobayakawa Takakage. However, the entire Jeolla campaign was then abandoned when Kim Myeon and his guerillas successfully ambushed Ankokuji&#x27;s troops by firing arrows from hidden positions within the mountains.

==== Jeolla coalition and Battle of Yongin ====
When the Japanese troops were advancing to Hanseong, Yi Gwang, the governor of Jeolla Province, attempted to check the Japanese progress by launching his army toward the capital city. Upon hearing the news that the capital had already been sacked, the governor withdrew his army. However, as the army grew in size to 50,000 men with the accumulation of several volunteer forces, Yi Gwang and the irregular commanders reconsidered their aim to reclaim Hanseong, and led the combined forces north to Suwon, south of Hanseong. On 4 June, an advance guard of 1,900 men attempted to take the nearby fortress at Yongin, but the 600 Japanese defenders under Wakizaka Yasuharu avoided engagement with the Koreans until 5 June, when the main Japanese troops came to relieve the fortress. The Japanese troops counterattacked successfully against the Jeolla coalition, forcing the Koreans to abandon arms and retreat.

==== First Geumsan campaign ====
Around the time of the mobilization of the volunteer army of General Gwak Jae-u in Gyeongsang Province, Go Gyeong-myeong in Jeolla Province formed a volunteer force of 6,000 men. Go then tried to combine his forces with another militia in Chungcheong Province, but upon crossing the provincial border he heard that Kobayakawa Takakage of the Sixth Division had launched an attack on Jeonju (the capital of Jeolla Province) from the mountain fortress at Geumsan. Go returned to his own territory. Having joined forces with General Gwak Yong, Go then led his soldiers to Geumsan. There, on 10 July, the volunteer forces fought with a Japanese army retreating to Geumsan after a defeat at the Battle of Ichi two days earlier on 8 July.

==== Warrior monks ====
Prompted by King Seonjo, the Buddhist monk Hyujeong issued a manifesto calling upon all monks to take up arms, writing, &quot;Alas, the way of heaven is no more. The destiny of the land is on the decline. In defiance of heaven and reason, the cruel foe had the temerity to cross the sea aboard a thousand ships&quot;. Hyujeong called the samurai &quot;poisonous devils&quot; who were &quot;as virulent as snakes or fierce animals&quot; whose brutality justified abandoning the pacifism of Buddhism to protect the weak and innocent. Hyujeong ended his appeal with a call for monks who were able-bodied to &quot;put on the armor of mercy of Bodhisattvas, hold in hand the treasured sword to fell the devil, wield the lightning bolt of the Eight Deities, and come forward!&quot;. At least 8,000 monks responded to Hyujeong&#x27;s call, some out of a sense of Korean patriotism and others motivated by a desire to improve the status of Buddhism, which suffered discrimination from a Sinophile court intent upon promoting Confucianism.

In Chungcheong Province, the abbot Yeonggyu proved to be an active guerrilla leader and together with the Righteous Army of 1,100 commanded by Jo Heon attacked and defeated the Japanese at the Battle of Cheongju on 6 September 1592. After the victory, the Korean leaders began to quarrel among themselves over who was most responsible, and it was that when the Koreans took the offensive, the regulars under Yun Songak refused to take part while the Righteous Army under Jo Heon and the warrior monks under abbot Yeonggyu marched separately. On 22 September 1592, Jo Heon, with 700 Righteous Army guerrillas, attacked a Japanese force of 10,000 under Kobayakawa Takakage. Turnbull described the second battle of Geumsan as an act of folly on Jo&#x27;s part as his outnumbered force took on &quot;10,000 of the toughest samurai&quot;, who encircled the Righteous Army and &quot;exterminated&quot; them, wiping out the entire Korean force as Kobayakawa ordered that no prisoners be taken. Feeling obligated to come to Jo&#x27;s aid, the abbot Yeonggyu now led his warrior monks against Kobayakawa at the third battle of Geumsan, who likewise suffered the same fate—&quot;total annihilation&quot;. However, as the Geumsan salient had taken three successive Korean attacks in a row in a single month, the 6th Division under Kobayakawa was pulled back as Toyotomi Hideyoshi decided the salient was not worth the trouble to hold it, and to the suffering people of the region that was all that mattered. The Japanese withdrawal inspired further guerrilla attacks and one Righteous Army leader, Pak Chin, had an object hurled over the walls of the Japanese-held town of Gyeongju, which caused &quot;the robbers&quot;, as Korean accounts always called the Japanese, to go examine it. The object turned out to be a bomb that killed 30 Japanese. Fearing his garrison was now under-strength, the Japanese commander ordered a retreat to the coastal &quot;wajo&quot; (castle) at Sosaengpo.

=== Siege of Jinju ===
Jinju was a strategic stronghold that defended Gyeongsang Province. The Japanese commanders knew that control of Jinju would mean easy access to the ricebelts of Jeolla Province. Accordingly, a large army under Hosokawa Tadaoki approached Jinju. Jinju was defended by Gim Si-min, one of the better generals in Korea, commanding a Korean garrison of 3,000 men. Gim had recently acquired about 170 new arquebuses that were equal in strength to the Japanese guns. As customary, the Japanese began to collect heads, with the &quot;Taikōki&quot; mentioning how a samurai named Jirōza&#x27;emon &quot;took the first head and raised it aloft. The other five men also attacked and took some excellent heads&quot;. The Japanese had usually had little trouble with taking Korean castles and towns, and a certain contempt for the fighting abilities of the Koreans was common among the samurai, so it was a great surprise for the Japanese when they assaulted Jinju to be hit with a barrage of fire as Gim&#x27;s men dropped heavy stones and bombs while firing their arquebuses, stopping their assault cold.

Hosokawa ordered a new assault with the samurai advancing this time under bamboo shields with covering fire from their arquebuses, which allowed them to place ladders across the walls of Jinju. A scene of carnage occurred, with the Koreans dumping rocks and delayed action bombs down on the Japanese. The &quot;Taikōki&quot; reported:

For three days, the Japanese attacked Jinju fruitlessly with the moats becoming full of their dead. On 11 November 1592, a force of Korean guerrillas led by Gwak Jae-u arrived as the relief force, and to fool the Japanese into thinking his force was much larger than it was, Gwak ordered his men to light fires at night on the hills while blowing their conch shells. On 12 November, Hosokawa Tadaoki ordered a final attempt to storm Jinju, with heavy fighting on the northern gates, with General Gim being killed when a Japanese bullet went through his head, but the Korean arquebus fire drove off the Japanese. At that time, another Korean relief force bringing badly needed ammunition arrived up the Nam River, causing Hosokawa to break off the siege, who argued that with the Japanese deep in enemy territory and no reserves to cover his rear that it was too dangerous to continue the siege. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was enraged when he heard of the defeat, saying the Japanese should never be defeated by Koreans, and vowed vengeance. With the help of arquebuses, cannon, and mortars, the Koreans were able to drive the Japanese from Jeolla Province. The result of the battle at Jinju prevented the Japanese from entering Jeolla Province.

=== Intervention of Ming China ===
Unable to repel the Japanese invasion, Korea ultimately had to rely on the intervention of Ming China to halt the Japanese advance, despite the various logistical and organizational difficulties suffered by the Japanese.

Korean Court historian and politician Yu Sŏngnyong stated that the Korean naval victory stalled the entire strategy of the invaders by &quot;cutting off one of the arms&quot; with which Japan tried to envelop Korea, isolating Konishi Yukinaga&#x27;s army at Pyongyang and securing Chinese waters from the feared Japanese attack, such that &quot;the Celestial Army could come by land to the assistance&quot; of Korea.
Viewing the crisis in Joseon, the Wanli Emperor and the Ming court were initially filled with confusion and skepticism as to how their tributary could have been overrun so quickly.

The Korean court was at first hesitant to call for help from the Ming dynasty, and began a withdrawal to Pyongyang. After repeated requests by King Seonjo, and after the Japanese army had already reached Korea&#x27;s border with China, China finally came to the aid of Korea. China was also somewhat obligated to come to the assistance of Korea because Korea was a tributary state of China, and the Ming dynasty did not tolerate the possibility of a Japanese invasion of China. The local governor at Liaodong eventually acted upon King Seonjo&#x27;s request for aid following the capture of Pyongyang by sending a small force of 5,000 soldiers led by Zu Chengxun. Zu, a general who had fought successfully against the Mongols and the Jurchens, was over-confident, holding the Japanese in contempt. This cavalry force advanced almost unhindered and managed to enter Pyongyang, but was promptly and decisively defeated by the Japanese troops in the city. On 23 August 1592, the Chinese attacked under the cover of a heavy rainstorm, taking the Japanese by surprise. Once the Japanese realized that they outnumbered the Chinese by six to one, they allowed the Chinese cavalry to spread out over the streets of Pyongyang and counter-attacked, using their superior numbers to annihilate the Chinese. As the Chinese retreated into the muddy fields outside of Pyongyang, the samurai cut them down in the hundreds. One of their leading generals, Shi Ru, was killed in this engagement. The Japanese were elated at having defeated an army from China, the foremost power in East Asia, but Konishi Yukinaga grew despondent over the fall of 1592 as it became clear that no reinforcements would arrive from Japan. The fleet of Admiral Yi Sun-sin was preventing any Japanese ships from landing, while the attacks of the Korean Righteous Army guerrillas left the Japanese forces in northern Korea largely cut off from the forces in southern Korea. At conference in Hanseong, Konishi told Ukita Hideie that he was not certain if Pyongyang could be held if the Chinese were to attack again with greater numbers. During the later half of 1592, the Ming sent investigation teams into Pyongyang to clarify the situation. The Ming became fully aware of the situation and made the decision for a full reinforcement by September 1592. With the victory in Ningxia, the Chinese finally had the forces available for Korea, and Li Rusong, the general who crushed the Ningxia revolt was sent to expel the Japanese from Korea.

By then, it had become clear that this was a situation much more serious than something that could be handled by local forces. Thus, the Ming Emperor mobilized and dispatched a larger force in January 1593 under the general Li Rusong and Imperial Superintendent Song Yingchang, the former being one of the sons of Ming dynasty&#x27;s Liaodong military magistrate, Li Chengliang, and the latter being a bureaucratic officer (Ming military law stipulated that any military officer would have an accompanying bureaucrat appointed by the Imperial Court acting as the general&#x27;s superior). According to the collection of letters left by Song Yingchang, the strength of the Ming army was around 40,000, composed mostly of garrisons from the north, including around 3,000 men with experience against Japanese pirates under Qi Jiguang. Li wanted a winter campaign as the frozen ground would allow his artillery train to move more easily than it would under the roads turned into mud by the fall rains. On 5 January 1593, Wu Weizhong led an advance force of 3,000 men across the Yalu River into Korea, followed by two battalions of 2,000 men each later the same day. At Uiju, King Seonjo and the Korean court formally welcomed Li and the other Chinese generals to Korea, where strategy was discussed. 

Thailand, a longtime faithful tributary state of the Chinese dynasties, offered to directly attack Japan to intervene in Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s plans, but Ming did not accept, instead ordering Thailand to attack Burma.

=== Siege of Pyongyang ===
On 5 February 1593, the Ming expeditionary army arrived outside Pyongyang accompanied by a group of Korean soldiers. Ming general Li Rusong was appointed the supreme commander of all armies in Korea. After initial attempts to negotiate with the Japanese defenders under Konishi Yukinaga broke down, the two sides began skirmishing on the outskirts over the next couple of days, with Li Rusong attempting to dislodge a Japanese garrison on the hills north of the city while Konishi Yukinaga attempted a night raid on the Ming camp. The Japanese night attack was beaten off by the Chinese fire archers, and Li ordered a feigned retreat, leading the over-confident samurai to fall into a trap, resulting in their annihilation. The Sino-Korean force consisted of 43,000 Chinese, 10,000 Koreans, plus Righteous Army guerrillas, and about 5,000 warrior monks. Li admitted that the Japanese infantry were better equipped with guns, but assured his officers: &quot;Japanese weapons have a range of a few hundred paces, while my great cannon have a range of five to six &quot;li&quot; [2.4 km]. How can we not be victorious?&quot; The city of Pyongyang was one of the most powerful fortresses in Korea, and to take it, Li&#x27;s plans called for surrounding the city on all four sides, starting a fierce bombardment under which his infantry would advance.

The Korean warrior monks, led by Abbot Hyujeong, attacked the headquarters of Konishi Yuninaga on Moranbong, coming under heavy Japanese arquebus fire, taking hundreds of dead, but they persevered. Later that same day, the Chinese under Wu Weizhong joined the attack, and with a real danger that Konishi would be cut off from the rest of his army, So Yoshitoshi led a counterattack that rescued the Japanese forces from Moranbong. After the fall of Moranbong after two days fighting, Li Rusong ordered his cannons to open fire while fire arrows and incendiary bombs set much of the city on fire. On the morning of 6 February, Li ordered an all-out assault on three sides of the city. The Chinese took heavy losses as the Japanese fire was withering, but Li, whose horse was killed, was able to bring up the siege ladders, called &quot;cloud ladders&quot; by the Chinese. Li had offered 5,000 ounces of silver for the first man to get over the wall, an honor that was claimed by an infantryman from Zhejiang Province named Luo Shangzhi, who got up unto the wall while using his halberd to great effect.

Japanese defenders were forced off the walls fairly quickly, and retreated to the citadel they built on the eastern portions of the city. Chinese officers initially scoffed at the earth walls of the Japanese citadel, but after coming under fire from the Japanese arquebuses, soon learned to respect the defense. The &quot;Jingbirok&quot; reported: &quot;The enemy built clay walls with holes on top of their fortress, which looked like a beehive. They fired their muskets though those holes as much as they could, and as a result, a number of Chinese soldiers were wounded&quot;. The allies were unwilling to commit to a direct assault on the heavily defended fortification during the day. Instead, they left an opening for the Japanese to rally while making preparations for a fire assault on their position at night. Japanese forces sallied out of the undefended eastern walls and made a run for Hanseong, and they were hit with additional ambushes on the way back south and took heavy casualties.

A samurai, Yoshino Jingoze&#x27;emon, wrote about the retreat:

The fortress of Pungsan, held by Otomo Yoshimune of the Third Division, had been abandoned and burned down by him, before Konishi&#x27;s force reached it, adding to the misery of the retreat. Otomo ruined his reputation by retreating without being attacked, and as a result, the Otomo clan, one of the oldest and most respected &quot;daimyō&quot; families on Kyushu, were disgraced forever, as under &quot;Bushido&quot;, cowardice was the worst disgrace for a samurai. Otomo&#x27;s disgrace was also a blow for the efforts of Jesuit missionaries in Japan as Otomo had converted to Catholicism after long talks with the Portuguese Jesuits, and many Japanese concluded that Christianity with its emphasis on love and gentleness was not a suitable religion for a samurai. Song Yingchang&#x27;s letters on 1 March 1593, described the battle in full to the Ming court. After their defeat, the Japanese shifted their strategy to hit-and-run tactics and ambushes. The use of gunpowder technology and street fighting contributed to the victory, which would permanently deter the invasion.

=== Battle of Byeokjegwan ===
Soon after retaking Pyongyang, Li Rusong also succeeded in retaking the major city of Kaesong on 19 January 1592, and met only minor resistance from the Japanese defenders.

Overconfident with his recent success and possibly misled by false reports, Li Rusong advanced towards the capital city of Hanseong with his allied army of 20,000 on 21 January 1593. On 26 January, the force ran into an unexpected confrontation at Byeokjegwan with a large Japanese formation of about 30,000.

Initially, the scouting party of the group under Cha Da Sho and a Korean general confronted a small band of Japanese numbering no more than 600 men. The party overran them successfully but soon ran into a much larger host under Tachibana Muneshige, and retreated to a nearby hill to defend themselves.

Upon hearing of his scouting party&#x27;s plight, Li decided to rush forward with the rest of his small host. He met up with his scouting party around noon, but by that time even more Japanese forces were converging on the area.

The Ming forces gradually retreated north while fighting off several waves of attacks. Li Rusong and many other generals personally fought in the brawl, and they sustained heavy casualties before they met up with the rest of their army toward the later portion of the day. At that point, the Japanese gave up further attacks and both sides pulled back. Because the Ming suffered heavy casualties among their elite retinues, Li became reluctant to move aggressively for the remainder of the war.

=== Battle of Haengju ===
The Japanese invasion into Jeolla Province was broken down and pushed back by General Kwŏn Yul at the hills of Ichiryeong, where outnumbered Koreans fought Japanese troops in the Battle of Byeokjegwan and gained a victory. Gwon Yul quickly advanced northwards, retaking Suwon and then swung north toward the fortress Haengjusanseong, a wooden stockade on a cliff over the Han River, where he would wait for Chinese reinforcements. After he was informed that the Ming army under Li Rusong was pushed back at Byeokje, Gwon Yul decided to fortify Haengju. Kwon&#x27;s force of 2,300 men were a mixture of regulars, warrior monks, and Righteous Army guerrillas.

Bolstered by the victory at the Battle of Byeokjegwan, Katō Kiyomasa and his army of 30,000 men advanced to the south of Hanseong to attack Haengjusanseong, an impressive mountain fortress that overlooked the surrounding area. An army of a few thousand led by Gwon Yul was garrisoned at the fortress, waiting for the Japanese. Katō believed his overwhelming army would destroy the Koreans and therefore ordered the Japanese soldiers to simply advance upon the steep slopes of Haengju with little planning at about 6 am. Gwon Yul responded to the Japanese advance with fierce fire from the fortification using hwachas, rocks, handguns, and bows. The &quot;hwach&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;fire wagon&quot;) was a cart that could fire either 100 rockets or 200 arrows at once; the &quot;hwach&#x27;a&quot; took much time to load, but were capable of bringing down deadly fire. Gwon had trained his men to fire their &quot;hwach&#x27;as&quot; all at once, and as the Japanese were packed closely together, the volley from the &quot;fire wagons&quot; inflicted heavy losses. The women of Hanseong joined their menfolk, bringing up rocks in their skirts. In the course of nine assaults, the Japanese pushed the Koreans back to their second line, but could advance no further. Korean sources estimate up to 10,000 Japanese may have been killed or wounded in the process. The &quot;Jingbirok&quot; wrote: &quot;Gwon Yul ordered his soldiers to gather the dead bodies of the enemy and vent their anger by tearing them apart and hanging them on the branches of the trees&quot;. Facing unexpected resistance and mounting casualties, Katō Kiyomasa burned his dead and finally pulled his troops back.

The Battle of Haengju was an important victory for the Koreans, as it greatly improved the morale of the Korean army. The battle is celebrated today as one of the three most decisive Korean victories (the other two being the 1592 Battle of Hansan Island and the siege of Jinju). Today, the site of Haengjusanseong has a memorial built to honor Gwon Yul. By this time, the Japanese invasion force of about 150,000 men were down to about 53,000 men, with Chinese reinforcements arriving every day. Most of the Japanese were suffering from hunger, frostbite, and snow-blindness and some Japanese soldiers were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to defend themselves from tigers in the mountains. With the situation untenable, the Japanese retreated to the coast.

=== Stalemate ===
After the Battle of Byeokjegwan, the Ming army took a cautious approach and moved on Hanseong again later in February after the successful Korean defense in the Battle of Haengju.

The two sides remained at a stalemate between the Kaesong to Hanseong line for the next couple of months, with both sides unable and unwilling to commit to further offensives. The Japanese lacked sufficient supplies to move north, and the defeat at Pyongyang had caused part of the Japanese leadership, such as Konishi Yukinaga and Ishida Mitsunari, to seriously consider negotiating with the Ming dynasty forces. This got them into a heated debate with other hawkish generals such as Katō Kiyomasa, and these conflicts would eventually have further implications following the war in Japan when the two sides became rivals in the Battle of Sekigahara.

The Ming forces had their own set of problems. Soon after arriving in Korea, the Ming officials began to note the inadequate logistical supply from the Korean court. The records by Qian Shizhen noted that even after the Siege of Pyongyang, the Ming forces were already stalled for nearly a week due to the lack of supplies, before moving on to Kaesong. As time went on, the situation only become more serious. When the weather warmed, the road conditions in Korea also became terrible, as numerous letters from Song Yingchang and other Ming officers attest, which made resupplying from China itself also a tedious process.

The Korean countryside was already devastated from the invasion when the Ming forces arrived, and in the heart of winter it was extremely difficult for the Koreans to muster sufficient supplies. Even though the court had assigned the majority of the men on hand to tackle the situation, their desire to reclaim their country, along with the militarily inexperienced nature of many of their administrators, resulted in their continual requests to the Ming forces to advance despite the situation. These events created an increasing level of distrust between the two sides.

Though by mid April 1593, faced with ever-greater logistical pressure from a Korean naval blockade of Yi Sun-sin, in addition to a Ming force special operation that managed to burn down a very significant portion of the Japanese grain storage, the Japanese broke off talks and pulled out of Hanseong.

=== Second siege of Jinju ===
Unlike the first siege of Jinju, the second siege resulted in a Japanese victory. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was especially determined to take Jinju and ordered that the previous Japanese failure to take the city be avenged. Ukita Hideie led 90,000 Japanese troops to take Jinju, making it the largest mobilization of Japanese forces for a single operation in the entire war. The Koreans, not knowing where the Japanese were going, divided their forces, with Kim Cheon-il commanding the garrison of 4,000 soldiers at Jinju, who were joined by volunteers, guerrillas, a small Chinese force, and a large number of civilians including women and children, making for a total of about 60,000. On 20 July 1593, the Japanese began to construct wooden shields to allow them to advance against the walls. To the west were Konishi Yukinaga with 26,000 men, and to the north were Kato Kiyomasa with 25,000, while Ukita Hideie commanded the reserve of 17,000. On 21 July 1593, the Japanese attacked, breaking the dyke that filled the moat around Jinju, while the samurai advanced under their wooden shields, to be stopped by Korean fire arrows, cannonballs, and arquebuses. On 23 July, the Japanese attacked with wooden siege towers, which were knocked down by Korean cannon fire. On 25 July, under a flag of truce, Ukita sent a messenger to Kim, telling him that the Japanese would slaughter 10,000 Korean peasants whom they had taken prisoner if Jinju did not surrender at once, but Kim refused, and so 10,000 Korean peasants were beheaded.

The Japanese now attacked with armored carts called &quot;tortoise shell wagons&quot;, which allowed the Japanese to advance up to the walls, where the sappers would pull out the stones. But as a Japanese account complained: &quot;They tried to attack, but from inside the castle, pine torches were thrown that set the grass alight. The soldiers inside the tortoise wagons were also burned and retreated&quot;. On 27 July, the Japanese again attacked with the &quot;tortoise shell wagons&quot;, but this time, there was a heavy thunderstorm that prevented Korean attempts to incinerate the Japanese by dropping torches soaked in fat. The Japanese sappers broke down a section of the wall and a great rush broke out with the samurai pushed each other down as it was a great honor to be the first samurai to enter a fortress. Goto Mototsugu, a retainer of Kuroda Nagamasa, was about to be the first samurai to enter Jinju when Iida Kakbei, a retainer of Kato Kiyomasa, threw the Nichiren flag into the breach to claim that honor for himself. The Korean garrison was out of ammunition and were short of swords, so many Koreans fought with wooden sticks against the onrush of samurai armed with &quot;katanas&quot;. One Korean, General Sŏ Yewon, engaged in a lengthy single combat with a samurai named Okamoto Gonjo, which ended when the wounded General Sŏ lost his breath and fell down by a tree, and Okamoto took the chance to sever his head with a single blow from his &quot;katana&quot;. Sŏ&#x27;s head fell down by the Nam River, which as it was a great honor for a samurai to take the head of their enemies, led Okamoto to order a search to find Sŏ&#x27;s head, so that it could be salted and taken back to Japan. The Korean commander, General Kim Cheon-il, committed suicide.

As usual, the Japanese took no prisoners, killing almost everyone, both military and civilian, and the Nam River ran red with blood as thousands attempted to swim across it, only to be cut down by the samurai waiting on the other side. The chronicler of the Kato clan noted: &quot;All the Chinese were terrified of our Japanese blades, and jumped into the river, but we pulled them and cut off their heads&quot;. Korean accounts mention that almost all of the 60,000 soldiers in Jinju were killed while Japanese accounts mention the samurai sent 20,000 heads back to Japan after their victory. Only the &quot;kisaeng&quot; (courtesans) of Jinju were spared as they were pressed into service for the victorious Japanese generals at a party they held to celebrate their victory on the evening of the same day at the Ch&#x27;oksŏngu Pavilion on a nearby hill, as it offered the best view of the &quot;hellish scene&quot; below them. One courtesan, Nongae, attracted the attention of a samurai, Keyamura Rokunosuke, whom she lured to a cliff by promising him sex, and then threw both herself and him off the cliff, becoming a national heroine in Korea. Jinju was taken only for symbolic purposes, and instead of advancing, the Japanese force at Jinju retreated back to Busan as there was a larger Chinese force to the north. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was well satisfied that he had avenged the defeat of 1592 at Jinju, though Turnbull argued that to lose so many men to take a town only for symbolic reasons was wasteful.

===Negotiations and truce between China and Japan (1594–1596)===
There were two factors that triggered the Japanese to withdraw: first, a Chinese commando penetrated Hanseong and burned storehouses at Yongsan, destroying most of what was left of the Japanese troops&#x27; depleted stock of food. Secondly, Shen Weijing made another appearance to conduct negotiations, and threatened the Japanese with an attack by 400,000 Chinese. The Japanese under Konishi Yukinaga and Katō Kiyomasa, aware of their weak situation, agreed to withdraw to the Busan area while the Chinese would withdraw back to China. A ceasefire was imposed, and a Ming emissary was sent to Japan to discuss peace terms. For the next three years, there was little fighting as the Japanese retained control of a few coastal fortresses, with the rest of Korea being controlled by the Koreans.

By 18 May 1594, all the Japanese soldiers had retreated to the area around Busan and many began to make their way back to Japan. The Ming government withdrew most of its expeditionary force, but kept 16,000 men on the Korean peninsula to guard the truce.

Once peace negotiations between China and Japan finally got underway, Chinese negotiators gave the Ming emperor the mistaken impression that he was about to deal with a minor state that had been subdued by war. Furthermore, they conveyed the idea that the Japanese regent, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was prepared to become his vassal. Under such conditions, the Chinese sought to resolve the issue in their favor by including Japan in their tributary system of foreign relations. They would establish Hideyoshi as king of Japan and grant him the privilege of formal tribute trade relations with the Ming dynasty.

In Japan, Hideyoshi&#x27;s negotiators apparently led him to believe that China was suing for peace and was ready to accept him as their emperor. Thus, Hideyoshi issued the demands of a victor; first, a daughter of the Ming emperor must be sent to become the wife of the Japanese emperor; second, the southern provinces of Joseon must be ceded to Japan; third, normal trade relations between China and Japan must be restored; and fourth, a Joseon prince and several high-ranking government officials must be sent to Japan as hostages.

Bargaining from such fundamentally different perspectives, there was no prospect whatsoever for success in the talks. Early in 1597, both sides resumed hostilities.

==Chŏngyu War: second invasion (1597–1598)==
After the failed peace negotiations of the inter-war years, Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched the second invasion of Korea. One of the main strategic differences between the first and second invasions was that conquering China was no longer an explicit goal for the Japanese. Failing to gain a foothold during Katō Kiyomasa&#x27;s Chinese campaign, and the near complete withdrawal of the Japanese forces during the first invasion, had established that the Korean peninsula was the more prudent and realistic objective.

Japan&#x27;s second force arrived unopposed on the southern coast of Gyeongsang Province in 1596. 
Soon after the Chinese ambassadors had safely returned to China in 1597, Hideyoshi sent approximately 200 ships with an estimated 141,100 men under the overall command of Kobayakawa Hideaki.

However, the Japanese found that the Korean army was both better equipped and better prepared to deal with an invasion than several years prior. In addition, upon hearing the news in China, the imperial court in Beijing appointed Yang Hao as the supreme commander of an initial mobilization of 55,000 troops from various (and sometimes remote) provinces across China, such as Sichuan, Zhejiang, Huguang, Fujian, and Guangdong. A naval force of 21,000 was included in the effort. Ray Huang, a Chinese-American philosopher and historian, estimated that the combined strength of the Chinese army and navy at the height of the second campaign was around 75,000. Korean forces totaled approximately 30,000 men, with General Gwon Yul&#x27;s army in Gong Mountain in Daegu, General Gwon Eung&#x27;s troops in Gyeongju, General Gwak Jae-u&#x27;s soldiers in Changnyeong, Yi Bok-nam&#x27;s army in Naju, and Yi Si-yun&#x27;s troops in Chungpungnyeong.

=== Initial offensive ===

Initially, the Japanese found limited success, being largely confined to Gyeongsang Province and only launching numerous raids to harass and weaken the Korean defenders. In the early autumn of 1597, the Japanese began a more focused and sustained advance. The Japanese planned to attack Jeolla Province in the southwestern part of the peninsula and eventually occupy Jeonju, the provincial capital. Korean success in the First Siege of Jinju in 1592 had mostly saved this area from devastation during the first invasion (the Second Siege of Jinju in 1593, while a Japanese victory, was only undertaken for symbolic purposes). Two Japanese armies, under Mōri Hidemoto and Ukita Hideie, began the assault in Busan and marched towards Jeonju, taking Sacheon and Changpyeong along the way.

==== Plot to dismiss Yi Sun-sin ====
The Korean navy was again to play a crucial part in the second invasion, as in the first, by hampering Japanese advances on land by harassing supply fleets at sea. However, despite his previous successes, Yi Sun-sin was both demoted and jailed by King Seonjo, largely due to a Japanese plot to deceive the Korean court and take advantage of the court&#x27;s political infighting. Government officials gave direct orders to launch a surprise naval operation against the Japanese, based on a tip from a presumed reliable Japanese spy. Yi refused to obey these orders, knowing that this was an obvious trap meant to have his own fleet sail into an ambush. This development allowed others within the court to further advance their personal agendas while Yi was severely punished. Ultimately, Won Gyun was appointed in Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s place at the head of the Korean navy.

==== Battle of Chilcheollyang ====

After Won Gyun replaced Yi Sun-sin as head of the Korean navy, he was quick to take action and justify his newly acquired position. He gathered the entire Korean fleet, which now had more than 100 ships, outside of Yeosu, to search for the Japanese. Without any previous preparations or planning, Won Gyun then had his entire fleet sail towards Busan.

After one day at sea, Won Gyun was informed of a large Japanese fleet near Busan. He decided to attack immediately, despite reports of exhaustion among the crews of his ships.

At the subsequent Battle of Chilcheollyang, Won Gyun was completely outmaneuvered by the Japanese in a surprise attack. His ships were overwhelmed by arquebus fire and the traditional Japanese boarding attacks, which largely resulted in the destruction of his entire fleet. Prior to this engagement, Bae Seol (1551–1599), a naval officer who did not submit to Won Gyun&#x27;s leadership, kept thirteen panokseons under his command and out of the battle, instead escaping to the southwestern Korean coast. These would form the entire fighting force of the Korean navy during the following months.

The Battle of Chilcheollyang was Japan&#x27;s only decisive naval victory of the war. Won Gyun was himself killed by a Japanese garrison after he struggled ashore on an island following the destruction of his flagship. The victory allowed the Japanese navy to safely escort its troop ships and to support planned landing operations.

==== Siege of Namwon ====
After the disaster at Chilcheollyang, the allied defenses in the south began to quickly break down and the Japanese forces stormed into Jeolla Province. The garrison of Namwon became their next key target.

Namwon was located 50 kilometres southeast of Jeonju. Correctly predicting a Japanese attack, a coalition force of 6,000 soldiers (including 3,000 Chinese troops under Yang Yuan and civilian volunteers) were prepared to fight the approaching Japanese forces. The Japanese laid siege to the walls of the fortress with ladders and siege towers. The two sides exchanged volleys with arquebuses and bows. Eventually, the Japanese forces scaled the walls and sacked the fortress. According to Japanese commander Okochi Hidemoto, author of the &quot;Chosen Ki (Korean Record),&quot; the Siege of Namwon resulted in 3,726 casualties among the Korean and Chinese forces. The Korean forces and its leaders were almost entirely killed.

When the gates were opened, many Koreans simply laid down on their knees, knowing the samurai would behead them, while others tried to flee north, where the samurai commanded by Katō Yoshiaki and Shimazu Yoshihiro were waiting and proceeded to cut down all Koreans with their &quot;katanas&quot;. The Japanese Buddhist monk Keinen, who was traveling with the samurai, described a scene of utter horror as the full moon illuminated the scenes of destruction with much of the town on fire, the formerly white walls of Namwon turned red with blood, and the wailing of the Koreans, knowing it was their time to die as the samurai gave no mercy, killing all. Only Yang Yuan managed to sally out after the walls were breached, with a handful of men, to return to Hanseong. He was later executed by the Ming court because of his defeat in battle. Traditionally, samurai collected the heads of those they killed, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi had insisted that the samurai send him the noses of those they had killed as proof that they were fighting. Okochi counted the heads of 3,725 Koreans killed that day, and removed their noses, which were pickled in salt and sent back to Japan. All of the noses of the Koreans killed by the samurai are buried near the shrine to the Great Buddha put up by Hideyoshi in Kyoto, which, as Turnbull noted &quot;...they remain to this day inside Kyoto&#x27;s least mentioned and most often avoided tourist attraction, the grassy burial mound that bears the erroneous name of the Mimizuka, the &#x27;Mound of Ears&#x27;.&quot;.

==== Battle of Hwangseoksan ====
Hwangseoksan Fortress consisted of extensive walls that circumscribed Hwangseoksan and garrisoned thousands of soldiers led by generals Jo Jong-do and Gwak Jun. When Katō Kiyomasa laid siege to the mountain with the Army of the Right, and attacked at night under the full moon, the Koreans lost morale and retreated with 350 casualties. The successful siege did not, however, lead to a subsequent advance from beyond Gyeongsang Province.

==== First Korean and Ming counter offensive ====
Upon the start of the second invasion, the Ming Emperor was furious about the entire debacle of the peace talks and turned his wrath on many of its chief supporters; particularly Shi Xing, the Minister of War, who was removed from his position and jailed (he died several years later, in prison). The chief negotiator, Shen Weijing, was executed. Xing Jie, the Chief Commissioner of the Liaodong Commandery, was named the new Minister of War and Yang Hao as the new Chief Superintendent of Korea; Xing Jie himself was also stationed in Korea for the remainder of the war. The Ming leadership quickly pulled in many units stationed near its border with Korea.

==== Battle of Jiksan ====
After the steady advances on land, the Japanese planned to assault Hanseong by late August or early September 1597. However, the plans were foiled by a Ming defense around Jiksan (modern-day Cheonan).

Forces under Kuroda Nagamasa formed the vanguard of the Right Army and marched toward Hanseong, which deeply disturbed the court there. Several of the Ming generals stationed in Korea suggested to the court that they pull back their forces until they could gather more reinforcements, but the Ming administrators overruled their generals and ordered them to make a stand. Thus the Chief Commander of the Ming forces at the time, Ma Gui, sent out General Jie Sheng and three other generals with an elite cavalry force to confront the Japanese forces. The Battle of Jiksan halted the Japanese northward advance.

According to Korean records, the Ming forces ran into the vanguard forces under Kuroda Nagamasa around the area of Jiksan. On the first day, they beat back a small scouting party. On the second day, the two forces clashed in earnest, with the Japanese being beaten back.

On 16 October 1597, Kuroda Nagamasa&#x27;s force of 5,000 arrived at Jiksan, where 6,000 Ming soldiers were stationed. Kuroda&#x27;s forces charged the enemies and was soon joined by the rest of the army, bringing Japanese forces to 30,000. Although heavily outnumbering the Ming, the Japanese were unable to do much damage due to the Ming&#x27;s superior armor. According to Kuroda and Mōri Hidemoto, their firearms could not penetrate the iron shields used by Chinese soldiers, and their armor was at least partially bulletproof. The battle continued until dusk when the two sides withdrew.

Kuroda launched another attack at night, this time in a pronged sweeping crane formation that sought to crush the enemies between them. The attack failed and turned into a rout that was joined by 2,000 Ming cavalry.

Jiksan was the furthest the Japanese ever got towards reaching Hanseong during the second invasion.

==== Battle of Myeongnyang ====
After the debacle in Chilcheollyang, King Seonjo immediately reinstated Yi Sun-sin. Yi Sun-sin quickly returned to Yeosu, where he found the majority of his navy destroyed. Yi re-organized the navy, now reduced to the thirteen ships that Bae Seol had held back from Chilcheollyang and approximately 200 men. On 26 October 1597, in the Myeongnyang Strait, Yi Sun-sin encountered a large Japanese fleet of approximately 133 warships, with a further 200 logistical ships in support. By making use of a narrow passage, Yi positioned his ships in a battle line that prevented the Japanese navy from making use of their numerical superiority. The Battle of Myeongnyang resulted in a Korean victory, with Yi Sun-sin retaking the naval initiative. The Koreans did not lose a single ship and destroyed approximately 30 Japanese combat ships, severely damaging another 30 (the oft-cited number of 333 ships in the Japanese fleet includes support ships, which would not be considered combat ships). The Battle of Myeongnyang is considered Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s greatest battle, largely as a result of the disparity of numbers. Even after the victory, however, the Joseon navy was still outnumbered by the remaining Japanese navy, so Admiral Yi withdrew to the Yellow Sea to resupply his fleet and have more space for a mobile defense. After the Korean navy withdrew, the Japanese navy made an incursion into the western coast of Korea, near some islands in Yeonggwang County.

==== Siege of Ulsan ====
By 29 January 1598, the Joseon and Ming allied forces achieved victory in Jiksan and pushed the Japanese further south. After the news of the loss at Myeongnyang, Katō Kiyomasa and his retreating army looted Gyeongju, the former capital of Unified Silla.

The Japanese forces sacked the city and many artifacts and temples were destroyed, most prominently, the Bulguksa, a Buddhist temple. Ming and Joseon forces continued to harass the Japanese forces, who then withdrew further south to Ulsan, a harbor that had been an important Japanese trading post a century before, and which Katō had chosen as a strategic stronghold.

Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s control of the areas around the coast of Jeolla permitted no supply ships to reach the western side of the Korean Peninsula, into which many extensive tributaries merge. Without provisions and reinforcements, the Japanese forces were constrained to the coastal fortresses, known as &quot;wajō&quot;, that they still controlled. The advancing Ming forces attempted to take advantage of this situation by attacking Ulsan. This siege was the first major offensive from the Ming forces in the second phase of the war.

The effort of the Japanese garrison (about 7,000 men) of Ulsan was largely dedicated to its fortification in preparation for the expected attack. Katō Kiyomasa assigned command and defense of the base to Katō Yasumasa, Kuki Hirotaka, Asano Nagayoshi, and others before proceeding to Sosaengpo near Ulsan. The Ming army&#x27;s first assault on 29 January 1598, caught the Japanese army unaware and still encamped, for the large part, outside Ulsan&#x27;s unfinished walls.

A total of around 36,000 troops with the help of singijeons and hwachas nearly succeeded in sacking the fortress, but reinforcements under the overall command of Mōri Hidemoto came across the river to aid the besieged fortress. Although the Japanese garrison was desperately short of supplies, the Ming commander Ma Gui judged the situation to be going against the allies, because more and more Japanese forces began to arrive from the surrounding area and the allied forces were quickly becoming outnumbered. Late one night, Ma Gui decided to order a general organized retreat of the allied forces, but soon confusion set in, and matters were further complicated by heavy rainfall and harassing attacks by the Japanese. The Chief Superintendent Yang Hao panicked and left hastily for Hanseong ahead of the army.

The general retreat quickly turned into a chaotic rout, of which the Japanese took quick advantage by attacking the retreating Ming and Joseon forces. The retreating Ming and Joseon forces had 20,000 losses. The disaster was a heavy setback for Joseon, who would not be in a position to move on the Japanese position again for more than eight months.

=== Final allied offensive of 1598 ===
After the siege at Ulsan, the two sides remained in a stalemate for the next several months. Xing Jie decided that they would require further reinforcements to launch a final large offensive to permanently remove the Japanese presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Reinforcements from China began to pour in through most of mid-1598, with Chen Lin and Deng Zilong and their navy arriving in May. By September 1598, the Ming presence in Korea had swelled to 75,000 overall, by far the largest at any point in the war.

Xing Jie divided his forces into four groups, with Ma Gui leading the offensive against Ulsan yet again, Li Rumei (Li Rusong&#x27;s brother) leading the offensive against Sacheon, Chen Lin commanding the navy, and Liu Ting and Yi Sun-sin coordinating a land-sea effort against Suncheon.

Just before they set out, however, news came that Li Rusong was killed by Mongolian tribesmen back in Liaodong. Xing Jie decided then to remove his emotionally weakened brother Li Rumei in favor of Dong Yiyuan.

In June 1598, after Commander Konishi Yukinaga raised concerns about the supply situation and limited prospects for further territorial gains in the peninsula, 70,000 troops were withdrawn back to Japan, with only 60,000 left behind to guard the territory still under Japanese control. These forces were mostly Satsuma soldiers of the Shimazu clan under commanders Shimazu Yoshihiro and his son Tadatsune. Kato Kiyomasa remained in command of the defenses of Ulsan while Konishi Yukinaga himself commanded the defenses at Suncheon. The forces at Sacheon and Ulsan continued to be engaged in a military deadlock in the months that followed.

At Ulsan, Kato Kiyomasa defended the castle with 10,000 Japanese soldiers. In September 1598, 29,500 Ming and Joseon troops tried again to capture Ulsan Castle, but all their attempts were repulsed by the Japanese. The Ming and Joseon forces withdrew with heavy losses.

==== Battle of Sacheon ====
The Chinese believed that Sacheon was crucial to their goal of retaking the lost castles in Korea and ordered a general attack. Although the Chinese made initial progress, the tide of battle turned when Japanese reinforcements attacked the rear of the Chinese army and the Japanese soldiers inside the fortress sallied from the gates and counter-attacked. The Chinese Ming forces retreated with 30,000 losses, with the Japanese in pursuit. According to Chinese and Korean sources concerning the battle, the forces led by Dong Yiyuan had breached the castle wall and were making progress in capturing the castle until a gunpowder accident caused an explosion in their camp, and the Japanese took advantage of the situation to rout the confused and weakened troops.

==== Siege of Suncheon ====
At Suncheon, Konishi Yukinaga defended his position at the Suncheon Castle along with 13,700 Japanese soldiers. A total of 43,000 Ming and Joseon troops tried to capture it, but their attempts were repulsed after three failed assaults, suffering 800 losses.

=== Death of Hideyoshi ===
In the fall of 1598, following the successful Japanese defense at the battles of Sacheon, Ulsan, and Suncheon, the Ming, Joseon, and Japanese forces were locked in a military stalemate in the south of the peninsula. After the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi on 18 September 1598, the Council of Five Elders, in late October, issued orders for the withdrawal of all forces from Korea. Hideyoshi&#x27;s death was kept a secret by the council to preserve the morale of the army.

=== Battle of Noryang ===
The Battle of Noryang was the final naval battle in the war. A Japanese fleet of approximately 500 ships, under Shimazu Yoshihiro, was assembled and preparing to link up with the blockaded fleet under Konishi Yukinaga, and together withdraw via Busan back to Japan.

The Korean navy under Yi Sun-sin discovered the Shimazu fleet anchored in the narrow strait of Noryang. Noting the narrow geography of the area, Ming general Chen Lin, who led Deng Zilong and Yi Sun-sin, made a surprise attack against the Japanese fleet, under the cover of darkness on 16 December 1598, using cannon and fire arrows.

By dawn, more than half of the Japanese fleet was scattered and destroyed. During the pursuit of the remaining Japanese ships, both Yi Sun-sin and Deng Zilong were killed. Despite suffering high casualties, in the end the battle was a great tactical victory for the Korean forces and resulted in the loss of over half of the Japanese fleet and the deaths of thousands of their men.

Strategically, the Japanese attained their objective by allowing Konishi Yukinaga, who was earlier blockaded by the Ming and Korean forces, to leave his fortress on 16 December with his men and withdraw unopposed by sailing through the southern end of Namhae Island, bypassing both the Noryang Strait and the battle, with the cost of betraying his own fellow Japanese generals. Konishi Yukinaga, Shimazu Yoshihiro, Katō Kiyomasa, and other Japanese generals of the Left Army, congregated in Busan and withdrew to Japan on 21 December. The last ships damaged sailed to Japan on 24 December, bringing an end to six years of war.

==Post-war negotiations==
As Tsushima Island had suffered greatly from its loss of trade with Korea as a result of the invasions, Sō Yoshitoshi of the Sō clan, then dominant in Tsushima, undertook the lead in the peace negotiations by Japan. He sent four peace missions to Joseon in 1599 to normalize relations. The first three were captured and sent directly to Beijing by Chinese troops, but the fourth one, in 1601, successfully obtained from the Joseon court the promise of a normalizing of relations upon the return of remaining Joseon captives. As Ming troops continued to be present in Korea following the withdrawal of Japanese forces, the major incentive for Joseon for the normalization of relations with Japan was the withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers from their territory. The Ming Chinese themselves were causing havoc, and their presence continued to strain Joseon&#x27;s national economy and infrastructure. In response to the Joseon request, Yoshitoshi promptly released several Joseon prisoners and between 1603 and 1604 helped the Joseon envoys to repatriate a further 3,000 by organizing negotiations at Kyoto with Tokugawa Ieyasu, by then the shogun of Japan.

In the continuation of the diplomatic talks toward peaceful relations, Joseon in 1606 expanded its conditions and demanded that the shogun write a formal letter requesting peace, and to extradite the Japanese soldiers who had defiled the Joseon Royal Tombs near Hanseong. Realizing that the Shogunate would never agree to such a request, Sō Yoshitoshi sent a forged letter and a group of criminals instead; the great need to expel the Ming soldiers pushed Joseon into accepting and to send an emissary in 1608. The result was a return of Joseon prisoners and the restoration of diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.

==Aftermath and conclusion==

The Japanese invasions were East Asia&#x27;s first regional wars involving massed armies equipped with modern weapons. The conflict saw the regular employment of Japanese armies of up to 200,000 men, Ming Chinese armies of 80,000, and the ongoing deployment of local Korean forces numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

The invasions also stood as a challenge to the existing Chinese world order on two levels: the military, in which the war challenged Ming China&#x27;s status as the supreme military power in East Asia, and the political, in which the war affirmed Chinese willingness to aid in the protection of its tributary states.

This was the only military conflict between China, Japan, and Korea in the period between 1281 (the second Mongol invasion of Japan) and 1894 (the First Sino-Japanese War).

===Losses and gains===
Contrary to Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s intentions, the cost of the Japanese invasions of Korea significantly weakened the Toyotomi clan&#x27;s power in Japan. After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, his young son Toyotomi Hideyori became head of the Toyotomi clan. However, the losses suffered by varying &quot;daimyōs&quot; during the campaign were a contributing factor to the imbalance of power in Japan after the war. As the western-based &quot;daimyōs&quot; of Kyushu and western Honshu (partially by geographic convenience) contributed the majority of the forces used during the Korean conflict, it left the pro-Hideyoshi alliance weakened for the eventual struggle with the mostly eastern-backed forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu (who himself never sent forces to Korea). Tokugawa would go on to unify Japan and establish himself as shogun in 1603, following the decisive Battle of Sekigahara against a coalition of mostly western-based &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

Ming China also sustained a heavy financial burden for its role in defending Korea while also fighting several other conflicts in the same decade. Falling tax revenues, troop desertions, a flow of foreign silver which brought unexpected problems in the Chinese economy, poor granary supervision and harsh weather eventually culminated in the collapse of the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty was eventually defeated by a rebel leader named Li Zicheng. With the help of Wu Sangui, a former Ming general, the Manchus defeated Li and established its rule over China in 1644. However, the sinocentric tributary system that the Ming had defended continued to be maintained by the Qing, and ultimately, the war resulted in a maintenance of the status quo—with the re-establishment of trade and the normalization of relations between all three parties.

Given that the conflict was fought exclusively on Korean soil, Korea ultimately suffered the most damage of the three participants. It lost a large portion of its military strength and civilian population, had numerous cultural heritage sites damaged or destroyed, and many of its technological advancements pillaged. In many ways the invasions proved to be more devastating than any other event in the nation&#x27;s history (even, arguably, more so than the Korean War). The peninsula suffered a reduction of arable land to 66% of the prewar total, greatly hurting Korea&#x27;s mainly agricultural economy; in the years that followed, famine, disease, and rebellions were widespread throughout Korea. In Gyeongsang Province alone 90% of the land under cultivation was destroyed. Significant losses of historical archives, cultural and scientific artifacts (such as the Ja-gyuk-roo water clock), and skilled artisans resulted in a waning of Korean science. The main Korean royal palaces Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, and Changgyeonggung were burned down, and Deoksugung was used as a temporary palace. The Baekjeong (Korean natives of the lowest social rank) took advantage of the lack of internal security brought on by the invasions, and set fire to &quot;changnye&quot; (Korean government offices) in which census ledgers had been kept. The destruction of land and census registers made fiscal recovery difficult since taxation and corvée labour were based on them. The government was forced to trade rank and titles in order to obtain grain, using a practice called &quot;napsok pogwan&quot; (appointment through grain contributions), and the yangban elite, which was exempt from household taxes, exploited the occasion to increase its landholdings, thereby further depriving the central government of taxes raised on property.

The total military and civilian casualties, as estimated by the late-19th-century historian, George H. Jones, were one million, and total combat casualties were estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000. A total of over 100,000 Japanese, 185,000 Korean and over 29,000 Chinese troops were killed, and an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 captives were taken by the Japanese throughout the war. Among those captured, a total of 7,500 were later returned to Korea through diplomatic means at the conclusion of the conflict. A large portion of the remaining captives were sold to European traders—mainly Portuguese in Macau, who then resold them throughout Southeast Asia.

Although Korea suffered the most of the three combatants, there were some significant technological and cultural transfers that resulted from the war. Japanese swords, which were sometimes collected in the battlefield from dead Japanese soldiers, would inspire some of the basic designs of later Korean swords such as the &quot;hwando&quot;. Arquebus rifles, which the Joseon court had initially dismissed as ineffective and useless due to their low rate of fire, was rapidly adopted during and after the war by the Joseon military and production began as early as 1593. Some scholars believe that the reason the Joseon-Ming Army was not easily driven out and defeated during the reignition of hostilities in 1597 was in part due to the widespread adoption of arquebuses in the Joseon military. Besides this, Catholicism was first introduced in Korea during the war, as Catholic missionaries had begun arriving in Japan before the war and had become acquainted. In Korea, many of the first converts to Catholicism were Korean captives in Japan, records indicate more than 7,000 Korean captives converted from 1594 to 1598. Spanish missionary Gregorio de Céspedes (1551–1611) was a prominent driver behind this missionary work, and was also the first recorded Westerner to arrive in Korea and the only European eyewitness to the war. Last but not least, significant food and luxury items were introduced to Korea via the invasions. Evidence heavily suggests this, because Korean records initially recorded chili peppers, one of the most important ingredients in modern Korean cuisine as &quot;Japanese mustard&quot;, &quot;southern barbarian herb&quot; and &quot;Japanese herb.&quot;

The captives brought to Japan, including scholars, craftsmen, medicine makers, and gold smelters, provided Japan with many cultural and technological gains. In the years that followed, Japanese pottery and art advanced and developed a significant similarity to their Korean counterparts. Advances in other areas such as agriculture were also aided by technology and artisans acquired and captured during the invasions. Japanese typography advanced with the adoption of Chinese fonts. Because Korean pottery was highly prized in Japan, many Japanese lords established pottery-producing kilns with captured Korean potters in Kyushu and other parts of Japan. The production of Arita porcelain in Japan began in 1616 at the town of Imari with the aid of Korean potters who had been enticed to relocate there after the war.

Furthermore, Neo-Confucianism, which had originated from China and spread to Korea, was introduced to Japan because of the invasions. Many Korean scholars who were captured during the war by the Japanese would later become tutors of prominent Japanese daimyo. Furthermore, many classical Confucian texts were captured during the early stages of the war and taken back to Japan.

Japanese troops engaged in crimes against civilians in battles and often killed indiscriminately. Scorched earth policies were often employed: over 60% of farmland was destroyed and burned, and farm animals were slaughtered to prevent their use by Joseon or Ming forces. Outside of the main battles, raids to acquire food and supplies from civilians were common. Captured prisoners were often mistreated or worked to near-death by starvation and neglect. In following their battlefield practice at the time, the Japanese also collected the ears and noses of dead soldiers as proof of their exploits on the battlefield and as a record of casualty counts. The high casualty rate of the Joseon and Ming forces, and the large number of ears collected during the campaign was enough to build a large mound near Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s Great Buddha, called the Mimizuka (&quot;Mound of Ears&quot;).

Korean armies were also known to forcefully acquire food and supplies from civilians, both on an individual and organized level. Korean bandits and highwaymen also took advantage of the chaos during the war to form raiding parties and rob other Koreans.

According to British historian who specializes in Japanese military history, Stephen Turnbull, the Ming forces arriving in support of Joseon were often no better than the Japanese in the amount of destruction they caused and the degree of the crimes they committed. After the immediate Japanese military threat was neutralized, Turnbull states that the Joseon desire for the Ming armies to quickly withdraw from Korean territory was a contributing factor to the pace of the eventual peace resolution.

Rape was common during the war, and Korean women were indiscriminately assaulted and brutalized by Japanese, Chinese and Korean soldiers throughout the conflict. Records from the war indicate that Japanese soldiers &quot;frequently decapitated all the young men of a locale and carried off all the attractive women—along with the goods they had stolen—on the backs of horses and oxen&quot; and descriptions claim that the key priorities of Japanese soldiers during the conflict were &quot;granaries, understanding local geography, and beautiful women.&quot; Meanwhile, Joseon soldiers, such as those led by Kim Myon, captured not only Japanese soldiers but also many Korean women who had &quot;been taken prisoner by the enemy. [The women] begged for their lives, only to be burned to death by the Choso˘n guerrillas along with the Japanese.&quot; Records also indicate that Ming Chinese and Joseon Korean forces committed rape against the civilian populace during the conflict.

===Legacy===
The war left significant legacies in all three countries. In the context of Japanese imperialism, the invasions are seen as the first Japanese attempt to become a global power. The partial occupation of Korea developed the Japanese concept that Korea belonged within Japan&#x27;s sphere of influence, and the Japanese leaders of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries used the 1592–1597 invasions to reinforce the justification for their 20th-century annexation of Korea. Yi-Sun Sin also served as an inspiration for Imperial Japanese admirals during the 19th and 20th centuries, as they often stressed the importance of studying and utilizing his battle tactics to further strengthen their navy.

In China, the war was used politically to inspire nationalistic resistance against Japanese imperialism during the 20th century. In Chinese academia, historians list the war as one of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s &quot;Three Great Punitive Campaigns&quot;. Contemporary Chinese historians often use the campaigns as an example of the friendship that China and Korea shared.

In Korea, the war is a historic foundation of Korean nationalism and, as in China, inspired and politically used to instigate nationalistic resistance against Japanese imperialism during the 20th century. Korea gained several national heroes during the conflict, including Yi Sun-sin and Chen Lin (founder of the Gwangdong Jin clan). Modern anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea can be traced as far back as the Japanese invasions in 1592, although the principal cause is rooted in more recent events, particularly the hardships suffered by Koreans during the Japanese rule of Korea from 1910 through 1945. The widespread guerilla warfare fought by various righteous armies, which spearheaded the Korean civilian resistance against the Japanese invasion, had a significant impact on the common Korean populace&#x27;s conceptions of nationhood and identity. The invasions and subsequent efforts by the local gentry to rally the commoners had a critical impact on perceptions of national identity in Korea, as the gentry were recorded to have sent many letters and declarations against the Japanese invaders and called upon shared Korean history, culture and beliefs to unite the Korean people.

====International awareness====
Despite great interest in the war in East Asia, the Japanese invasions of Korea are not widely studied in the West. Many history textbooks publish only a few lines of mention regarding the war. With the exception of &quot;Samurai Invasion: Japan&#x27;s Korean War 1592–98&quot; (2002) by Turnbull, no other complete academic studies on the subject exist in English. Although true, both James Murdoch and George Sansom covered the topic in some detail in their general historical surveys of Japan, &quot;A History of Japan&quot; (1903) and &quot;A History of Japan&quot; (1958), respectively. Henry Kissinger also mentions the conflict in &quot;World Order&quot; (2014).

<text>Li Lianying (; 12 November 1848 – 4 March 1911) was a Chinese imperial eunuch who lived in the late Qing dynasty. He was a eunuch during the regency of Empress Dowager Cixi, who was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of China from 1869 to 1908 throughout the reigns of the Tongzhi Emperor and Guangxu Emperor.

==Names==
Li&#x27;s birth name was Li Yingtai (). He was renamed Li Jinxi () after entering the Forbidden City as a palace eunuch in 1856. In 1869, Empress Dowager Cixi gave him a new name, Li Lianying (), which became the name he is best known by.

==Life==
Li was born in a poor family in Zhili Province (roughly present-day Hebei) in 1848 during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor. He had been in the Forbidden City for several years but did not have the chance to even appear in the presence of the West Empress Dowager, Cixi. The eunuch serving Cixi at that time, Little An, did not let any one threaten his position. Li loved to gamble and because of his constant losses, he had racked up an enormous debt. To escape his debtors, Li left his hometown for the capital. Li would often visit an old eunuch whom he had met in the Forbidden City. From the old eunuch, Li learned that all the eunuchs who have had the privilege to serve and comb the hair of Cixi have been punished, with the exception of Little An. Li set his goal to become Cixi&#x27;s favorite eunuch. Thus he set forth to master hair design. He went to brothels, not for the ladies, but to learn how they did their hair. After several months, he had finally mastered every aspect of hair design. The old eunuch made it known that Li was a hair specialist and Li was summoned by Cixi. The empress was very satisfied with his work and he became her favorite eunuch, later becoming her head eunuch. Due to only Li satisfying the West Empress Dowager, he was made the general head eunuch in the Forbidden City.

In 1869, An Dehai, the eunuch who served as Grand Supervisor (), was executed by Ding Baozhen, the Provincial Governor of Shandong, for travelling out of the Forbidden City without permission. Earlier in 1861, Li had helped Empress Dowager Cixi in seizing power from a group of eight regents in the Xinyou Coup, and hence earned her favor. As such, after An Dehai&#x27;s death, the Empress Dowager chose Li to be her new personal attendant and subsequently promoted him to the position of Grand Supervisor.

As Grand Supervisor and Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s favorite attendant, Li held a highly influential position in the inner palace. He had control over things such as when officials could be granted an audience with the Empress Dowager and, as such, managed to acquire wealth from the bribes he collected from officials. The West Empress Dowager was eager to build up more wealth, so she began to sell official titles. Head Eunuch Li was the middle man so he got a lot of bribes. However, Li did not use his status to interfere in politics. At the same time, when the maids and eunuchs angered the Empress Dowager Cixi, Li spoke kind words and helped them in front of the Empress Dowager Cixi. Therefore, Qing Dynasty historical materials also have a cautious and kind evaluation of Li. Li was among those suspected of poisoning the Guangxu Emperor, who died in 1908 one day before Cixi&#x27;s death. Other suspects included general Yuan Shikai and Empress Cixi.

Li requested permission from Empress Dowager Longyu to retire after the death of Empress Dowager Cixi in 1908. Longyu approved his request and allowed him to return home after 100 days had passed since Cixi&#x27;s death. Li lived the rest of his remaining years in retirement and died in 1911 before the Xinhai Revolution broke out. He was buried in Enjizhuang () in present-day Haidian District, Beijing. Li was believed to have died from dysentery. However, when his grave was raided in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution, the raiders discovered that it contained only his skull, and hence there were rumors that he was murdered (possibly decapitated). Li&#x27;s grave was heavily damaged during the Cultural Revolution and only a fragment of his tombstone is left.

==Portrayals in media==
The 1991 Chinese film &quot;Li Lianying: The Imperial Eunuch&quot;, directed by Tian Zhuangzhuang, is based on Li&#x27;s life and starred Jiang Wen as Li. The 2006 Chinese television series &quot;Princess Der Ling&quot; starred Wu Liping as Li. The 2012 Hong Kong television series &quot;The Confidant&quot;, produced by TVB, is also based on Li&#x27;s life and starred Wayne Lai as Li.

<text>Jure Franko () (born 28 March 1962 in Nova Gorica) is a Slovenian-Yugoslav former alpine skier, best known for winning a giant slalom silver medal at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.

Jure Franko was born and raised in Nova Gorica, a city in Slovenia at the border with Italy. Franko competed in giant slalom and super giant slalom events, and reached the peak of his skiing career in the 1983–84 season. On 14 February 1984, at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, he won a silver medal in giant slalom. This was the first Winter Olympics medal ever for Yugoslavia. Franko was at the 4th position after the first leg of the giant slalom, and delivered the fastest time of the second leg, bringing him to second place overall (Max Julen from Switzerland took gold).

Franko also competed in the World Cup competitions, where he placed himself 3rd three times. In addition, he achieved 23 top ten positions, and 11 additional top 15 positions. He quit skiing after the 1984–85 season.

In January 2006, Jure Franko participated in the 2006 Winter Olympic torch relay, by relaying the torch from Slovenia to Italy at the Slovenian-Italian border in Nova Gorica. He also organised a trip for 43 children of modest economic backgrounds from Sarajevo, Nova Gorica and Gorizia to visit the giant slalom event at the 2006 Winter Olympic games in Turin, Italy.

He is the &quot;Honorary Citizen of Sarajevo&quot;, an honor bestowed upon Slovenian skier by the City Council of Sarajevo at the session held on 30 September 2020.

Jure is sometimes confused with &quot;Jurij&quot; Franko, designer of the Elan SCX ski. The two attended the same school during the 1970s.

<text>White pudding, oatmeal pudding or (in Scotland) mealy pudding is a meat dish popular in Great Britain and Ireland.

White pudding is broadly similar to black pudding, but does not include blood. Modern recipes consist of suet or fat, oatmeal or barley, breadcrumbs and in some cases pork and pork liver, filled into a natural or cellulose sausage casing. Recipes in previous centuries included a wider range of ingredients.

==History and recipes==

White pudding is often thought of as a very old dish that, like black pudding, was a traditional way of making use of offal following the annual slaughter of livestock. Whereas black pudding-type recipes appear in Roman sources, white pudding likely has specifically medieval origins, possibly as a culinary descendant of medieval sweetened blancmange-type recipes combining shredded chicken, rice and almonds, or as a way of lightening up offal with the addition of cream, eggs and breadcrumbs. Meatless versions were common, as they could be eaten during the Lenten period of abstinence. Many older recipes are sweetened: a 15th-century British pudding combined pork liver, cream, eggs, breadcrumbs, raisins and dates, while a 1588 recipe collection featured a white pudding made of beef suet, breadcrumbs, egg yolk and currants, flavoured with nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. A similar recipe given in Woolley&#x27;s 1670 book &quot;The Queen-Like Closet&quot; used hog&#x27;s lights and was filled into intestine sausage-skins. By the mid-18th century, Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s white pudding recipe, &quot;White Puddings in Skins&quot;, combined rice, lard, ground almonds, currants and egg, using sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and mace as flavourings; by this period the inclusion of offal such as liver or lights, as well as sweet flavourings, was becoming rarer.

An oatmeal pudding recipe found in the 18th-century &quot;Compleat Housewife&quot; is made with beef suet and cream, thickened with oatmeal and mixed up with egg yolks, then baked in a dish with marrow.

Alongside these more refined and elaborate recipes, a simpler form of white pudding was popular in Ireland, Scotland, the West Country and some parts of Northern England, combining suet, oatmeal (or barley in Northumberland), seasoning and onions, in sheep&#x27;s or cow&#x27;s intestines. In Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland and Ireland, they were referred to by the names or . These oatmeal-based puddings survived into modern Irish and Scottish cuisine, although with significant regional differences. In Cornwall and Devon, these are either Hog&#x27;s or Groats pudding depending on the fineness or coarseness of texture. Modern commercially made Scottish white puddings are generally based on oatmeal, onions and beef suet; the same mixture simply fried in a pan is known as skirlie. In Ireland, white puddings also include a substantial proportion of pork or pork liver and pork fat. Most modern white puddings are filled into a synthetic cellulose casing and boiled or steamed; typical spices used include white pepper, nutmeg and sage.

==Preparation==
White pudding may be cooked whole, or cut into slices and fried or grilled. Irish white pudding is an important feature of the traditional Irish breakfast. Scottish white pudding is often served, like skirlie, with minced beef and potatoes, or is available deep fried in many chip shops.

==Regional variants==
White puddings were once also associated with south-western England: Taylor, in the 17th century, mentions &quot;the white puddings of Somersetshire&quot;. Hog&#x27;s pudding, still made in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, is very similar to other white puddings although is somewhat more highly spiced.

Another Scottish variant, fruit pudding, includes dried fruit in addition to beef suet and oatmeal.

<text>The Coleman Medal is an Australian rules football award given annually to the Australian Football League (AFL) player who kicks the most goals in the home-and-away season. It is named after Essendon full-forward John Coleman, one of the most prolific goalkickers in the league&#x27;s history, who was league leading goalkicker for five consecutive seasons.

The medal has been presented at various different events, including the preliminary and grand finals, the All-Australian awards ceremony, and club award ceremonies. &#x27;s Jesse Hogan is the most recent recipient, kicking 69 goals in 2024.

==History==
The award was first presented in 1981 to Richmond&#x27;s Michael Roach. At the time, the competition was known as the Victorian Football League (VFL); it would become the AFL in 1990. It was named after John Coleman, a full-forward and Australian Football Hall of Fame Legend who scored 537 goals in 98 games for Essendon between 1949 and 1954.

In September 2001, the AFL decided to recognise all leading goalkickers prior to Roach&#x27;s victory; leaders from 1955—the year after Coleman&#x27;s last match—to 1980 were named retrospective Coleman Medallists, while winners prior to 1955 were named Leading Goalkicker Medallists. Medals were presented to winners or their surviving relatives in a ceremony at Melbourne Town Hall in July 2004. Jack Collins, who had been a leading advocate for naming the award after Coleman and honouring leading goalkickers prior to 1981, was the only player to receive both a Coleman and a Leading Goalkicker Medal. Upon receiving the accolades, he was &quot;bloody angry&quot; and complained to the AFL Commission, as he perceived the Leading Goalkicker Medal to be an inferior award.

Collingwood is the club most frequently represented by Coleman and Leading Goalkicker Medallists: its players have won on 23 occasions, six clear of Geelong&#x27;s tally of 17. The majority of Collingwood&#x27;s awards were contributed by Dick Lee (7) and Gordon Coventry (6), which stand as the most and second-most in league history. Coleman himself won the Leading Goalkicker Medals in all five of his complete VFL seasons to have the third-most. As of 2023, there have been five four-time medallists, five three-time medallists, and 16 dual medallists.

<doc id="799695" wikidata="Q1479760" url="?curid=799695" title="Saltstraumen">
<text>or is a small strait with one of the strongest tidal currents in the world. It is located in Bodø Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. It is located about southeast of the town of Bodø. The narrow channel connects the outer Saltfjorden to the large Skjerstad Fjord between the islands of Straumøya and Knaplundsøya. The Saltstraumen Bridge on Norwegian County Road 17 crosses Saltstraumen.

==Current==
Saltstraumen has one of the strongest tidal currents in the world. Up to of seawater forces its way through a long and wide strait every six hours. Vortices known as whirlpools or maelstroms up to in diameter and in depth are formed when the current is at its strongest. At this point, one source claims that the tidal current can reach . 

Saltstraumen has existed for about two to three thousand years. Before that, the area was different due to post-glacial rebound. The current is created when the tide tries to fill Skjerstad Fjord. The height difference between the sea level and the fjord inside can be up to . When the current turns, there is a period when the strait is navigable.

The above account of the Saltstraumen is rather different than what The Norwegian Pilot reports. The Pilot’s description of the normal current is based on the time of the high tide at Bodø. The greatest southbound current occurs about one and a quarter hours before Bodø high tide, when the inflowing current reaches about . The speed of the current has a broad maximum being greater than from three hours before Bodø high tide until half an hour after Bodø high tide. The greatest northbound current occurs about four and a half hours after Bodø high tide, when the outflowing current reaches over . The speed of this current also has a broad maximum being above six knots from two hours and forty minutes after Bodø high tide until five and a half hours before the next Bodø high tide. The behavior of the current may differ from normal due to strong winds or when more fresh water than usual is entering into the fjord from the surrounding mountains.

==Fishing==
Saltstraumen is popular with anglers, due to its abundance of fish such as saithe, cod, wolffish, rose fish, and halibut. Coalfish is a specialty of the area. The largest documented coalfish of was caught in Saltstraumen on a fishing rod.

Eiders are the only birds capable of diving for mussels in the strong stream.

==Name==
The first element is the name of the district Salten and the last element is the definite form of &quot;straum&quot;, meaning &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;water flow&quot;.
==History==
The remains of a 10,000-year-old hunter settlement in the area are the oldest known traces of human settlement in Bodø, and also one of the oldest archaeological discoveries in Norway. These hunters lived on the edge of the ice, attracted by the abundance of fish caused by the strong currents.

<doc id="799706" wikidata="Q3687376" url="?curid=799706" title="Viktor Afanasyev (politician)">
<text>Viktor Grigoryevich Afanasyev (; 18 November 1922 – 10 April 1994) was a Soviet and Russian public figure, journalist and professor of philosophy who is remembered for his work as a philosophy academic, politician, and newspaper editor. Afanasyev was editor-in-chief (1974-1975) of the journal &quot;Kommunist&quot; and deputy editor (1968–1974) and editor-in-chief (1976–1989) of &quot;Pravda&quot;.

Moderately critical of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and still more so as a rising independent politician Boris Yeltsin in his capacity as editor, Afanasyev was dismissed from his high position at &quot;Pravda&quot; after a period of falling circulation and a negative official reaction to the newspaper&#x27;s highlighting Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s troubles with alcohol during the Gorbachev administration in 1989 and spent the remaining half-decade of his life working for the national Academy of Sciences in Moscow.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in 1922 in Aktanysh in the Tatar ASSR (now Russia&#x27;s Republic of Tatarstan) in 1922, Afanasyev joined the Red Army in 1940 and served with the Soviet paratroopers in the 1940s and World War II, remaining in the armed forces until 1953. He was awarded his first university degree for his independent completion of the required curriculum of the Chita Pedagogical Institute in Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai while still serving in the Soviet military. Afanasyev joined the All-Union Communist Party (b) in 1943.

===Academic and public figure===
Afanasyev first became a professional instructor upon leaving the Soviet Army in 1953 and continued concentrate his professional interest on teaching and administrative appointments in academia into the 1960s and 1970s. His appointments during this period included teaching as an instructor in Soviet Marxist theory at the Chelyabninsk Pedogagical Institute and a position with the philosophical branch of the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He authored a range of papers and books on philosophical subjects in the 1960s and 1970s. His dissertation for a &quot;Doktor nauk&quot; degree, a work concerned with issues pertinent to both philosophy and biology on a theoretical level, was accepted in 1964.

Afanasyev was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1972 and advanced to become a full member in 1981. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1976.

Afanasyev became deputy editor of &quot;Pravda&quot; (a newspaper given the prestige of serving as the &quot;official voice of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&quot;) in 1968. He remained as deputy editor with &quot;Pravda&quot; until joining the &quot;Kommunist&quot; (regarded as the theoretical and political organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) for a brief period as chief editor in 1974-1975. He returned to become chief editor of &quot;Pravda&quot; in 1975, remaining with the newspaper in the same capacity until 1989.

Afanasyev was a Deputy (representative) of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, serving from 1974 to 1979. He was twice elected as a Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, serving from 1979 to 1989.

====As &quot;Pravda&quot; editor====
Afansyev&#x27;s period as editor of &quot;Pravda&quot; saw a lukewarm response to Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s changes in the late 1980s, vacillating between support for Gorbachev&#x27;s policies and for those of his opponents in the leading circles of the party, while &quot;Pravda&quot; readership witnessed a precipitous decline, dropping by around half in the course of Gorbachev&#x27;s first four years at the helm of the Soviet Union.

A &quot;TIME&quot; story of October 1989 also recalled that Afanasyev &quot;suffered a nasty embarrassment last month, when &quot;Pravda&quot; reprinted a lurid dispatch from an Italian newspaper claiming that reformist Supreme Soviet Deputy Boris Yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through a tour of the U.S.&quot; The report noted that the newspaper was pressured into publishing an apology, although recorded video subsequently broadcast over the Soviet television &quot;appeared to show Yeltsin at least mildly intoxicated.&quot;

Afanasyev was dismissed in favor of Gorbachev ally Ivan Frolov under the guise of requesting a &quot;transfer to scientific work&quot; during the subsequent fallout. He spent the remaining half-decade of his life absorbed in work for the Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1991).

He died in Moscow in 1994 and was buried at the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

==Recognition==
Afanasyev was well-recognized for his service by the Soviet state: among the honors awarded him were two Orders of the October Revolution. He was a laureate of the USSR State Prize in 1983.

A thirty-six page work devoted to the achievements of Afanasyev&#x27;s life was published by the Institute of Socio-Political Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2002, in honor of what would have been Afanasyev&#x27;s 80th birthday.

<text>In Philippine mythology, the kapre is a creature that may be described as a tree giant or ape like, being a tall (), dark-coloured, hairy, and muscular creature. Kapres are also said to have a very strong body odour and to sit in tree branches to smoke.

==Origins==
The term &quot;kapre&quot; comes from the Arabic &quot;kafir&quot; (Spanish &quot;&quot;), meaning a non-believer in Arabic (usually referring to atheists/idolists). The term was later brought to the Philippines by the Spanish who had previous contact with the Moors, they used it to describe the indigenous Negrito ethnic groups with dark skin and features similar to Black Africans. This is also evident in the fact that a synonym for kapre is agtà, another name for the Aeta people. The modern mythical characterizations of the kapre evolved from formerly racially prejudiced portrayals of Negrito tribes by the lowland Christianized ethnic groups of the Philippines during the Spanish period.

The first attestation of the use of the term was &quot;chapri&quot;, by Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan expedition. They were described by the people of Suluan to the Magellan crew as dark-skinned, tattooed, and wore barkcloth (except for chieftains who wore a cloth headdress of silk), and had weapons ornamented with gold and large shields.

The term &quot;cafre&quot; was also used for Papuan slaves brought to the Philippines by the Portuguese before slavery was abolished by Spain.

==Natural habitat and attire==
Kapres are said to dwell in big trees like acacias, mangoes, bamboo, and banyan (known in the Philippines as &quot;balete&quot;). It is also mostly seen sitting under those trees. The Kapre is said to wear the indigenous Northern Philippine loincloth known as &quot;bahag&quot;, and according to some, often wears a belt which gives the kapre the ability to be invisible to humans. In some versions, the kapre is supposed to hold a magical white stone, a little smaller in size than a quail egg. Should any person happen to obtain this stone, the kapre can grant wishes.

==Behavior==
Kapres are believed to be nocturnal and omnivorous. They are not necessarily considered to be evil. However, they may turn vengeful when the tree that they are inhabiting is cut down.

A Kapre may make contact with people to offer friendship, or if it is attracted to a woman. If a Kapre befriends a human, especially because of love, the Kapre will push them away because of his negative aura and still try to consistently follow its &quot;love interest&quot; throughout life. Also, if one is a friend of the Kapre, then that person will have the ability to see it and if they were to sit on it then any other person would be able to see the huge entity.

Kapres, also called agtà, are said to play pranks on people, frequently making travelers become disoriented and lose their way in the mountains or in the woods. They are also believed to have the ability to confuse people even in their own familiar surroundings; for instance, someone who forgets that they are in their own garden or home is said to have been tricked by a Kapre. Reports of experiencing Kapre enchantment include that of witnessing rustling tree branches, even if the wind is not strong. Some more examples would be hearing loud laughter coming from an unseen being, witnessing much smoke from the top of a tree, seeing big red glaring eyes during night time from a tree, as well as actually seeing a Kapre walking in forested areas. It is also believed that abundant fireflies in woody areas are the embers from the Kapre&#x27;s lit cigars or tobacco pipe.

<doc id="799720" wikidata="Q30153" url="?curid=799720" title="Atlantic mackerel">
<text>The Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), also known as Boston mackerel, Norwegian mackerel, Scottish mackerel or just mackerel, is a species of mackerel found in the temperate waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the northern Atlantic Ocean, where it is extremely common and occurs in huge shoals in the epipelagic zone down to about . It spends the warmer months close to shore and near the ocean surface, appearing along the coast in spring and departing with the arrival of colder weather in the fall and winter months. During the fall and winter, it migrates out into deeper and more southern water, seeking warmer temperatures.

The Atlantic mackerel&#x27;s body is elongate, steel-blue marked with wavy black lines dorsally and silvery-white ventrally, its snout long and pointed. It possesses two spiny dorsal fins, which are spaced far apart, two pectoral fins, and small caudal and anal fins, also spaced far apart. 4–6 dorsal finlets and 5 anal finlets are typical among members of this species. The fish&#x27;s body tapers down its length, ending with a large tail fin. Typical size for a mature fish is , but individuals have been caught as large as . The maximum published weight is . Reproduction, which is oviparous, occurs near the shore in the spring and summer, during which a female can produce as many as 450,000 eggs. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at around 2 years of age and can live to be 17.

A highly commercial species, the Atlantic mackerel is sought after for its meat, which is strong in flavor and high in oil content and omega-3 fatty acids among other nutrients. Nearly 1 million tonnes of Atlantic mackerel are caught each year globally, the bulk of which is sold fresh, frozen, smoked, or canned. Despite its highly commercial status, the Atlantic mackerel is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and global catch has remained sustainable.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The Atlantic mackerel was first described in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Linnaeus gave it the scientific name &quot;Scomber scomber&quot; from the Greek word &quot;skombros&quot; meaning &quot;tunny&quot; or &quot;mackerel&quot;. Because of its wide distribution, the Atlantic mackerel was independently described 6 more times by 5 different scientists between 1814 and 1863. Its specific name was later changed to &quot;scombrus&quot; by B. B. Collette and C. E. Nauen in 1983. It is differentiated from its congeners in a number of ways, the first being the absence of a swim bladder. Its palatine bone is also wider than other members of its genus and its otolith is oval-shaped where its congeners&#x27; are rectangular.

In the eastern Atlantic Ocean there are three stocks differentiated by location and time at which spawning occurs, but studies have not found any distinct genetic differences between these populations. Genetic differences only start to appear at the scale, a fact supported by a lack of migration between western and eastern Atlantic populations, whereas eastern Atlantic stocks are known to converge in certain locations like the Norwegian Sea and North Sea.

==Description==
The Atlantic mackerel has an elongate, fusiform body with a long, pointed snout. The eyes are large and covered by an adipose eyelid, while the teeth are small, sharp, and conical. Scales are also small, with the exceptions of those immediately posterior to the head and around the pectoral fins. These small scales give the Atlantic mackerel a velvet-like feel. The two dorsal fins are large and spaced far apart. The second dorsal fin is typically followed by 5 dorsal finlets, though it can have 4 or 6. The anal fin, which originates slightly behind the second dorsal fin, is similar to it in size and shape and is also succeeded by 5 finlets. The fish&#x27;s body tapers to a slim caudal peduncle, the end of the fish to which the short but broad tail fin is attached. Its body is steel-blue dorsally with wavy black lines running perpendicular to the fish&#x27;s length. The rest of its body is silvery-white to yellow and may have darker splotches. It can reach sizes of up to and has a common length of . Its maximum published weight is .

==Distribution and habitat==
The Atlantic mackerel&#x27;s native range in the western Atlantic extends from Labrador, Canada to Cape Lookout, North Carolina. In the eastern Atlantic, it can be found from Iceland and Norway to as far south as Mauritania. It is also found in the Mediterranean, Black, and Baltic Seas. Its latitudinal range is 70°N-25°N and its longitudinal range is 77°W-42°E. Its preferred water temperature is above , but Atlantic mackerel are common in waters as cold as and have been found, albeit rarely, in waters. The Atlantic mackerel&#x27;s common depth range extends from the surface to , but individuals can be found as deep as .

Atlantic mackerel are migratory fish, spending the spring and summer closer to shore about out, with juveniles moving closer in to shore than adults. Occasionally, fish will even enter harbors, and those that do are usually juveniles. In the fall and winter they move farther out and farther south to the warmer waters on the edge of the continental shelf. They first come in to land in North America in April at the southern end of their range, but are found along the coast through their entire range by July. They start moving back out to sea again in September and are completely gone from the coast by December. Food availability increases greatly during the summer, and fish reach a peak for fat tissue in August, a mere four months after their lowest point in April.

==Biology and ecology==
The Atlantic mackerel is an active, fast-moving fish that must keep in constant motion to bring in enough oxygen to survive. It swims using short movements of the rear of its body and the caudal fin. Unlike other mackerel, Atlantic mackerel do not leap out of the water unless attempting to escape a predator. They form large schools, consisting of individuals of the same relative size, near the ocean surface during all seasons but winter. Because larger fish have a greater ratio of muscle mass to surface area, schools of larger fish are able to swim more quickly than schools made up of smaller individuals.

===Feeding===
When feeding on larger prey, schools tend to break down into shoals and individuals find food on their own. When consuming plankton, however, Atlantic mackerel form tight aggregations, open their mouths as wide as possible, and extend their operculums, swimming in a tightly packed school that acts like a series of miniature tow nets. Spaced only about the diameter of a single fish&#x27;s mouth apart, this formation greatly reduces the ability of plankton to evade capture, as a plankton darting out of the way of one fish is likely to end up in the jaws of another. Copepods make up the majority of the Atlantic mackerel&#x27;s diet, &quot;Calanus finmarchicus&quot; being the most abundant.

===Life history===
Like other mackerels, reproduction in the Atlantic mackerel is oviparous. Spawning occurs day or night in the spring and summer months, primarily within of shore, though it can occur as far out as . A single female can spawn as many as 450,000 eggs in a spawning season. Eggs mature in batches over the course of a week and are pelagic once released, remaining within of the surface. Time to hatching is dependent on the water temperature, and ranges from 2 days at to 8.5 days at . Most eggs are spawned in waters in temperature, and as such the majority of eggs hatch in about a week. Eggs are anywhere from in size, trending towards smaller as the spawning season goes on. Larvae undergo three developmental stages: the yolk sac stage, the larval stage, and the post-larval stage. Larvae are when they hatch and feed on the yolk sac for about 5 days. During the larval stage, which lasts about a month, larvae grow to in length. They are largely incapable of swimming, instead floating with the current. During the post-larval stage, which occurs over the next 40 days and during which the fish reaches in length, it swims to the surface at night and down to deeper waters during the day. At the end of the post-larval stage, juveniles resemble an adult mackerel in all but size. Schooling behavior occurs around this time.

Sexual maturity is reached at around 2 years of age, though some fish may reproduce a season earlier or a season later. Though some fish are sexually mature at in length, even by only about half of females will be ready to reproduce. At , 90% of fish are capable of reproduction. An Atlantic mackerel can live for up to 17 years and attain a length of and a weight of .

==Human interaction==

The Atlantic mackerel is of commercial importance to many Atlantic fisheries, which catch it with purse seines, trawls, gill and trammel nets, and trolling lines. Global annual catch is typically in the range of 1 million tonnes, though a 50% spike in 2014 put this number at nearly 1.5 million tonnes. The United Kingdom and Norway bring in the most Atlantic mackerel, with annual catches coming in at over 166,000 tonnes and 160,000 tonnes respectively. In 2022 alone, Norwegian fisheries exported an estimated 6.3 billion Norwegian Kroner worth of the Atlantic mackerel. The majority of the mackerel caught by Norwegian fisheries is exported to countries including China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. There are three stocks in the eastern Atlantic: one in the south, one in the west, and another in the North Sea. There are two populations in the Mediterranean, one in the east and one in the west. In the western Atlantic there are two stocks, one in the north and one in the south, for which assessments are, according to the IUCN, &quot;highly uncertain&quot;.

===As food===

Atlantic mackerel outer meat is red meat while inner meat is white, with a strong taste desirable to some consumers. They are sold fresh, frozen, smoked, salted, filleted, or as steaks. The fish is extremely high in oil content, vitamin B, vitamin B, selenium, niacin, and omega 3, a class of fatty acids, containing nearly twice as much of the latter per unit weight as salmon. Unlike the King and Spanish species, Northern Atlantic mackerel are very low in mercury, and can be eaten at least twice a week according to United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.

===Conservation===
Despite its commercial status, the Atlantic mackerel was assessed to be of Least Concern by the IUCN in 2011. Its abundance and extensive range combined with a cyclical increase/decrease in catch mean that it is not currently in danger of going extinct. The IUCN did recommend careful monitoring, however, especially as the effects of climate change may impact population size and distribution. In the northeastern Atlantic, several countries impose minimum landing sizes. In the European Union this size is , Ukraine , Turkey , Romania , and Canada .

===Symbol===
The Spanish word for mackerel () is a colloquial demonym for the people of Ceuta, Spain.

<text>Ala&#x27;i Darwaza () is the southern gateway of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque in Qutb complex, Mehrauli, Delhi, India. Built by Sultan Alauddin Khalji in 1311 and made of red sandstone, it is a square domed gatehouse with arched entrances and houses a single chamber. 

It has a special significance in Indo-Islamic architecture as the first Indian monument to be built using Islamic methods of construction and ornamentation and is a World Heritage Site.

==Background==
The Alai Darwaza was built by Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Khalji dynasty in 1311. It was a part of his plan to extend the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque on four sides. Although he planned to construct four gates, only the Alai Darwaza could be completed as he died in 1316. It serves as the southern gateway of the mosque. It is located at the southern part of the Qutb complex.

In 1993, the Darwaza and the other monuments of the complex were designated a World Heritage Site.
The surrounding of Qutb Minar including many tombs,mosque and Iron pillar is called Qutb Complex

==Architecture==
The Alai Darwaza is made up of a single hall whose interior part measures and exterior part measures . It is tall and the walls are thick. 

The gatehouse, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height. Bold contrasting colors of masonry, with red sandstone and white marble, introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild horseshoe arch effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized &quot;spearhead&quot; projections, possibly representing lotus buds. Net, stone openwork screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.

The height of the dome is . It is the first true dome built in India, as previous attempts to construct a true dome were not successful.

The entire Darwaza is made up of red sandstone with white colored marbles inlaid on the exterior walls. There is extensive Arabic calligraphy on the walls of the Darwaza. The arches are horseshoe shaped, the first time such arches were used in India. The façade has pre-Turkish carvings and patterns. The windows have marble lattices. The surface decoration consists of interweaved floral tendrils and is repeated with symmetry on three doorways.

<text>The Guardians of the Cedars (GoC; ; &quot;Ḥurrās al-Arz) was&quot; a far-right ultranationalist Lebanese party and former militia in Lebanon. It was formed by Étienne Saqr (also known with the kunya &quot;Abu Arz&quot; or &quot;Father of the Cedars&quot;) and others along with the Lebanese Renewal Party in the early 1970s. It operated in the Lebanese Civil War under the slogan: &quot;Lebanon, at your service.&quot; The militia was explicitly anti-Palestinian, and gained a reputation for brutality against Palestinian fighters and civilians.

==Creation==

The Guardians of the Cedars started to form a militia in the years leading up to the Lebanese Civil War and commenced military operations in April 1975.

In September 1975, Communiqué No. 1 was issued to denounce advocates of the partition of Lebanon. The second communiqué contained a bitter attack on the Palestinians. The third articulated the party&#x27;s stance on the issue of Lebanese identity: Lebanon should dissociate itself from Arabism. The party spread its messages by means of graffiti in East Beirut, including slogans against Syria, the Palestinian Resistance, and Pan-Arabism, sometimes with violent anti-Palestinian tones, as in the slogan على كل لبناني ان يقتل فلسطينياً (&quot;It is a duty for each Lebanese to kill a Palestinian&quot;).

The Guardians of the Cedars joined other pro-status quo, mainly Christian Lebanese, militias in 1976 to form the Lebanese Front.

===1970s===
In March 1976, they confronted Palestinian and leftist forces in West Beirut. A Guardians unit was also dispatched to Zaarour, above the mountain road to Zahlé, to support Phalangist forces. In April, Guardian fighters held a line in the area of Hadath, Kfar Shima, and Bsaba, south of Beirut, against a coalition of Palestinian, PSP, and SSNP forces.

In the summer of 1976, the Guardians were among the first militias to assault Tel al-Zaatar, the last remaining Palestinian refugee camp in east Beirut. The camp fell after a 52-day siege.

The actions of the Guardians and their allies following the capture of the camp have been widely reported as amounting to a massacre of many of its civilian inhabitants. During this battle, Saqr led a unit of Guardians force to Chekka, where Christian civilians were being sieged by leftist-Palestinian forces, and fought off the Palestinian forces.

The Guardians and allied Christian militias then invaded the Koura region in northern Lebanon and reached Tripoli, to support Christian residents trapped by fighting. In 1978 as part of the Lebanese Front they did small attacks on the Syrian army in Beirut and again in 1981 in the Battle of Zahle. This came after the alliance between the Phalanges and most Christian groups with the Syrians had taken a twist.

During the war, the Guardians earned a reputation for specializing in cruelty. Militia members usually tied Palestinian prisoners to the backs of taxis and then dragged them up the motorway into Jounieh. Their carcasses would then be flung into a dried-up riverbed. Commanding his followers to slay all Palestinians, Saqr once stated, &quot;If you feel compassion for the Palestinian women and children, remember they are communists and will bear new communists&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1985 the Guardians of the Cedars mounted a fierce defense of Kfar-Fallus and Jezzine, battling Palestinians and Shiite-Druze militias and protected thousands of Christians in South Lebanon.

Towards the close of the 1980s, and continuing to 2000, most of the remaining fighting in Lebanon occurred in the south, inside the Israeli-occupied zone, under the Southern-Lebanese-Army influence led by Saad Haddad and later by Antoine Lahd, the latter who had close ties with the National Liberal Party (Al Ahrar in Arabic). The Guardians and other militias were largely reorganized into the South Lebanon Army, preserving much of the early ideology while adopting new military tactics.

==Military structure and organization==
The LRP militia began to be quietly raised in 1974 by Sakr in his capacity as president of the Party, though it was only in September 1975 when they made their existence public in an official communiqué as the Guardians of the Cedars. Headquartered at the main LRP party&#x27; Offices in Ashrafieh and personally commanded by Sakr, the GoC initially numbered some 500 men and women trained by Kayrouz Baraket, a young Lebanese Army officer, and equipped with obsolete firearms purchased on the black market. Although the membership of the GoC was exclusively Maronite, Sakr allegedly maintained a loyal personal bodyguard made up of Lebanese Shia Muslims, but little is known about them. The collapse of the Lebanese Army in January 1976 allowed Sakr to recruit army deserters and seize some heavy equipment from its barracks and Internal Security Forces (ISF) Police stations, swelling the GoC ranks to 3,000-6,000 uniformed militiamen armed with modern small-arms. 
Besides being provided with funds and training by the Kataeb Party and the Al-Tanzim, the Guardians also claimed to have received direct aid from Israel as early as 1974. They were the only faction of the Lebanese Front that never received any military aid from Syria, which is hardly surprising, given their strong anti-Syrian views.

===Weapons and equipment===
They fielded a mechanized force consisting of a single M50 Super Sherman medium tank, some BTR-152 and M113 armored personnel carriers, a few M42A1 Duster SPAAGs and Chaimite V200 armoured cars backed by gun trucks or technicals. The latter consisted of UAZ-469, Land-Rover series II-III, Santana Series III (Spanish-produced version of the Land-Rover series III), Toyota Land Cruiser (J40), Dodge Power Wagon W200, Dodge D series (3rd generation), Jeep J20 pickup trucks, GMC Sierra Custom K25/K30, Chevrolet C-10/C-15 Cheyenne and Chevrolet C-20 Scottsdale light pickups, plus Chevrolet C-50 medium-duty trucks and GMC C4500 medium-duty trucks, GMC C7500 heavy-duty trucks and M34 2½-ton 6x6 cargo trucks armed with heavy machine guns (HMGs), recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft autocannons.

===Activities and areas of operations===
In stark contrast to other Christian factions, the LRP/GoC despised any illegal activities such as drug-trafficking, extortion or looting, and their leader Sakr never sought to establish an autonomous personal fiefdom. Although the Guardians&#x27; claimed that they did not center their military operations on &#x27;turf&#x27;, they did maintain strongholds at the Maronite quarters of East Beirut, the adjacent Matn District (Laqluk, near Akoura), the Batroun District (Tannourine), the eastern Keserwan District (Ayoun es-Simane) and the Jabal Amel region (Kfar Falous, Jezzine, Marjayoun, Qlaiaa, Ain Ebel and Rumeish). In May 1979 they even clashed with the NLP Tigers Militia in Beirut for control of the Furn esh Shebbak and Ain el-Rammaneh districts, and for the town of Akoura in the Byblos District.

==Political beliefs==
The Guardians hold to several key beliefs:
* Lebanon is an ancient nation of unique ethnicity.
* Modern Lebanese people descended from the Phoenicians.
* Phoenicia was the father of early Western civilization.

This has led the Guardians of the Cedars to maintain that Lebanese people are not Arabs. The political consequence of this stance advocates the &#x27;de-Arabization&#x27; of Lebanon. Similarly, followers draw a distinction between Arabic and &#x27;Lebanese&#x27;, aiming to restore the form created by Lebanese philosopher Said Akl. The Guardians of the Cedars have adopted positions hostile to Pan-Arabism. This is believed to be the main reason why they did not grow as a party in Lebanon outside the Maronite community.

Saqr himself had fought against pan-Arab forces back in the Lebanon Crisis of 1958. During that time Camille Chamoun entered Lebanon in the Baghdad Pact led by the US, but faced stiff resistance from a huge section of the Lebanese people, and this later led to the failure of this alliance.

After heavy Palestinian involvement in the Lebanese Civil War, the Guardians cultivated ties with the Israeli military, receiving weapons and support. Some followers maintain that this was a collaboration of necessity, and not an ideological agreement with the Israelis. Others disagree, claiming that collaboration with Israel was based on the conviction that there was a commonality of interest between the two countries. Other similarly aligned militias, such as the Phalangists, Ahrar and the Tigers, also cooperated semi-secretly with Israel. This cooperation was later emphasized by Saqr who said: &quot;Lebanon&#x27;s power is in Israel&#x27;s power, and Lebanon&#x27;s weakness lies in Israel&#x27;s weakness&quot;.

This alliance with Israel played a major role in banning the party, and expelling its members who mostly fled to Israel. Saqr, who now lives in Nicosia, Cyprus, has since admitted that Israel has been funding the group throughout its existence, even before the war began. Saqr is now considered as a traitor to the Lebanese government, alongside the likes of Antoine Lahad who resided in Tel Aviv under Mossad protection until his death in 2015.

According to an Israeli military observer Haim &#x27;Arev, the soldiers of the Guardians of the Cedars were the best and most experienced fighters among the militias that constituted the Lebanese Front. He draws a direct connection between the patriotic ideology of the Guardians and the superior battle capacity of their fighters. He states that while the Guardians were among the smaller parties of the Lebanese Civil war, its idealistic men and women were soldiers of the best caliber. Later, in Southern Lebanon, the Guardians fighters had a reputation for being exceptionally motivated and among the toughest fighters in the ranks of the SLA.

== Front of the Guardians of the Cedar ==

The Front of the Guardians of the Cedar – FGoC (Arabic: الجبهة لحراس الأرز transliteration &quot;Al-Jabhat li-Hurras el-Arz&quot;), sometimes known by its Arabic acronym, JIHA, was a pre-dominantly Christian right-wing grouping that appeared in 1974. Apparently a splinter of the Guardians of the Cedars, they held similar views to those of this party – expressed just prior to the war in anti-Palestinian graffiti bearing the &#x27;JIHA&#x27; signature scrubbed in the walls of east Beirut&#x27;s buildings – very little is known about this small and obscure organization. Estimated at about 100 members, the JIHA operated mainly in the eastern sector of the Lebanese Capital during the 1975-77 phase of the Lebanese Civil War, but nothing was heard from them afterwards. It is assumed that they might have been re-absorbed into the GoC or by the Lebanese Forces in 1977.

==Lebanese Renewal Party==

The Lebanese Renewal Party – LRP (Arabic: حزب التجدد اللبناني transliteration &quot;Hezb al-Tajaddud al-Lubnani&quot;) or Parti de la Renovation Libanaise (PRL) in French, is a banned political party in Lebanon formed in 1972 as the political arm of the paramilitary force known as the Guardians of the Cedars. It is often characterized as right-wing extremist, but by its followers as a patriotic nationalist movement. The party is still led by its founder, Étienne Saqr (Abu Arz).

===History===

It was formed by right-wing activists opposed to the presence of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The refugee population also included a substantial element of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters, especially after the 1970 Black September events in Jordan. This created severe tension in Lebanon, and is believed by many to have been a driving factor behind the outbreak of civil war in 1975.

During the Lebanese Civil War, the party and its militia were a small but active part of the Maronite-led alliance fighting the Palestinians represented by the Rejectionist Front and PLO, and its allies in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) of Kamal Jumblatt. During the early fighting in the war, the party was implicated in the massacres of Karantina and Tel al-Zaatar. In 1977, the main Christian-backed militias (LRP plus the National Liberal Party and the Kataeb Party) formed the Lebanese Front coalition. Their militias joined under the name of the Lebanese Forces, but the Lebanese Forces soon fell under the command of Bashir Gemayel and the Phalange. The Lebanese Renewal Party (LRP) and the Guardians of the Cedars were uncompromisingly opposed to the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.

After the 1982 Lebanon War the party cooperated with Israel Defense Forces, and its militia joined the South Lebanon Army (SLA). After the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon in 2000, most of the leadership fled to Israel. The group was banned by the Syrian-dominated government and decided to give up its arms to become a traditional political party. It remains banned, and is only a minor force in national life. Still, some of the rhetoric used by the LRP in advocating its domestic policies was revived during the Cedar Revolution in 2005, which forced the withdrawal of Syria from Lebanon and led to expectations of political reform.

===Ideological beliefs===
The Lebanese Renewal Party is ethnocentric, and believes that Lebanon is not an Arab country. It labored extensively to create or discover non-Arab cultural expressions, and went so far as to design a new alphabet for Lebanese Arabic, which it claims is a language in its own right. Accordingly, the party was staunchly opposed to Pan-Arabism, which was advocated by many in the left-wing Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and Palestinian movements.

Another distinguishing element of the party&#x27;s politics was that it advocated cooperation with Israel. While there were several other movements on the Christian side in Lebanon that cooperated with Israel during the war, the LNR was the only organization openly and ideologically committed to this, regarding a Lebanese-Israeli axis as the best protection against Arabism and the Palestinians.

==Attitude towards Palestinians and Lebanese Muslims==

The GoC was strongly anti-Palestinian, and argued for the forcible removal of all Palestinians and other non-Lebanese (e.g. Syrians) from Lebanon, both civilians and armed fighters. GoC leader Saqr summed up the organization&#x27;s attitude to Palestinians in an interview with the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; on July 23, 1982:

&quot;It is the Palestinians we have to deal with. Ten years ago there were 84,000; now there are between 600,000 and 700,000. In six years there will be two million. We can&#x27;t let it come to that.&quot; His solution: &quot;Very simple. We shall drive them to the borders of brotherly Syria ... Anyone who looks back, stops or returns will be shot on the spot. We have the moral right, reinforced by well-organized public relations plans and political preparations.&quot;

However, in contrast to the policies of many other sectarian militias (such as the Kataeb), and to their own attitudes towards Palestinians, the Guardians took some care to avoid the impression of religious conflict. The party, while essentially a Christian militia and in violent conflict with most Muslim militias during the war, was formally secularist as it publicly stressed this secular nationalist identity that both Muslims and Christians could share.

==End of the militia==
1989 saw the Guardians once more fighting the Syrians alongside the Lebanese Army in support of the military interim government of General Michel Aoun. In a statement in 1990, the GoC greeted the occupation of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein by asserting that &quot;Arabism is the undisputed lie of the 20th century.&quot; The Guardians called upon the people to rally around the leadership of General Aoun, and demanded the withdrawal of Lebanon from the Arab League.

As the Lebanese Civil War drew to a close in 1990, political changes weakened the right-wing movements which had existed in earlier decades. In October 1990, as part of the end of the war, the reorganized Lebanese government forced Prime Minister Aoun out of power under Syrian demands and commands. From this year on, Syria occupied Lebanon until its withdrawal in 2005.

Samir Geagea&#x27;s Lebanese Forces militia captured Etienne Saqr because he had supported Aoun. During this incident, he suffered an unspecified injury. He was forced to seek refuge in Jezzine, and finally left Lebanon for Europe after Israel pulled its forces out of Lebanon. Several other members of the Guardians are presently wanted by the Lebanese government, in order to answer for war-crimes.

From the end of the civil war in 1990 until the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 the Guardians of the Cedars formed an element of the now-defunct South Lebanon Army. Since that date their military operations have ceased and they operate solely politically, campaigning to remove the Syrian presence in Lebanon. In common with the Christian and Sunni-dominated March 14 Alliance, the party has expressed its support for the Syrian uprising.

==Movement of Lebanese Nationalism==
Today, the reorganized Guardians of the Cedars is a legal and fully functional political party; lately, the term Movement of Lebanese Nationalism (Arabic: حركة القومية اللبنانية transliterated as &quot;Harakat al-Qawmiyya al-Lubnaniyya&quot;) abbreviated as MLN was added to its name and it is now known as The Guardians of the Cedars Party - Movement of Lebanese Nationalism (in Arabic حزب حراس الأرز- حركة القومية اللبنانية).

<doc id="799726" wikidata="Q6134179" url="?curid=799726" title="Punggol LRT line">
<text>The Punggol LRT is an automated guideway transit line in Singapore. The line, which initially opened on 29 January 2005, connects the residential districts and suburbs of Punggol to Punggol Digital District and Punggol Town Centre, which consist of Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)’s campus and JTC’s Business Park, and where the town centre connects with the North East MRT line, Punggol Bus Interchange, and Waterway Point. 

The first phase is a line with 15 stations in two loops. It is the second LRT line to be operated by SBS Transit.

==History==
Plans for the Punggol LRT line were drawn up and announced in January 1999 with the development of Punggol New Town. Construction began in June 2000 by a consortium comprising Sembcorp Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Corporation, at a cost of S$354 million. Meanwhile, the Punggol LRT line was awarded to Singapore Bus Service (present-day SBS Transit) on 20 May 1999. The first phase was completed in June 2004 and underwent testing by the Land Transport Authority. The system was handed over to SBS Transit on 1 December that year, which conducted more trial runs and staff training before the opening of the East Loop on 29 January 2005. However, due to limited developments around some stations on the loop at the time, only the stretch of stations from Cove station to Kadaloor station were opened. The West Loop opened in stages from 29 June 2014.

In 2024, the Land Transport Authority announced that the Teck Lee LRT station will open to improve public transport connectivity and serve the upcoming Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) Punggol campus. This came after 19 years since the opening of the line in 2005. The date of the opening of Teck Lee station was later announced to be 15 August 2024.

A covered middle track at Punggol station and two short track pieces branching from Teck Lee station had already been built in anticipation of a possible branch line to Punggol North, but these plans were subsequently cancelled, and a new Punggol Coast MRT station is being built instead.

===Improvements===
On 31 October 2012, the Land Transport Authority announced that by 2016 the Sengkang and Punggol LRT lines would be upgraded to two-car trains, doubling the passenger capacity. An additional 16 more cars were to be ordered, bringing the total fleet size to 57. The longer trains also required modifications to the signaling and communication system.

On 29 December 2016, trains started operating in the two-car formations on the line&#x27;s East loop during morning and evening peak hours from 6.45 am to 8.45 am and from 6.15 pm to 8.15 pm. Service frequency will be maintained at three to four minutes during morning and evening peak hours.

On 15 December 2017, the Land Transport Authority said there will be limited services on parts of the Sengkang-Punggol LRT (SPLRT) on most Sundays from 14 January 2018 to 25 February that year, to facilitate renewal and improvement works from (except 18 February as it is a Chinese New Year holiday). Only one platform will open for service at 5.30am on Sundays. The other platform will open from 7am. On 22nd of that month, SBS Transit said the arrangement is expected to continue until end April that year.

From 27 May to 7 October that year, limited services on Sundays will continue on the Sengkang-Punggol LRT (SPLRT). One platform will open at 5.30am and the other platform will open at 5.30pm.

On 5 February 2021, the Land Transport Authority announced that it has purchased 17 two-car trains for the Punggol and Sengkang LRT systems. The new trains will be delivered progressively from 2024 to 2027. In addition to new trains, the Sengkang Depot will also be expanded to from the existing to ensure that is capacity and maintenance space for the new trains. The expansion of the depot will also see two new reception tracks being built to shorten the train launching time. To ensure there is enough electricity to support the larger fleet of trains, 3 new power stations will be built, increasing the total number of power stations supporting the system to 8 once completed.

===Services===
There are four services in total, with two on each loop. However, on the Electronic Display, they will not show the service letters.

==Rolling stock==

The Punggol LRT operates on the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover rolling stock shared with the Sengkang LRT. An initial 41 trainsets entered service in 2003 under C810, with an additional 16 train sets were delivered in 2016 under C810A, bearing only minor exterior differences from its predecessor. They are maintained and stabled at Sengkang Depot, with a service track between the Punggol and Sengkang LRT systems for the Punggol LRT trains to head to and from the depot.

The procurement of a further 34 vehicles (17 two-car trains) to boost the capacity of the Sengkang-Punggol LRT was announced by the Land Transport Authority in February 2021.

These trains, also known as automated people movers, are rubber-tyred for minimized operating noise within built-up areas and guided by two side rails and a power rail on either side. They operate in both single-car and double-car arrangements.

==Train formation==
The original system consists of single-car C810s. Each unit is long and can carry up to 105 passengers. 16 original C810s were modified to allow two-car train operation and 16 C810As came with this configuration. This boosted the capacity to 204 passengers per trip.

==Train control==
The line is equipped with Kyosan APM fixed block signalling system for automatic train control (ATC) under automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 4 (UTO). The subsystems consist of automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains, and a computer-based interlocking (CBI) system that prevents incorrect signal and track points settings.

==Incidents==
*On 23 March 2024, a 33-year-old woman by the name of Madam Wong Soon Heng was found dead at Cove station along the Punggol East LRT loop.
*On 9 June 2024, a signalling fault on the Sengkang LRT and Punggol LRT lines caused services to be suspended from the first trains around 5.45 am until 10.12 am.

<text>The Archostemata are the smallest suborder of beetles, consisting of 50 living species in five families and over 200 described fossil species. They are an ancient lineage with a number of primitive characteristics. Antennae may be thread-shaped (filiform) or like a string of beads (moniliform). This suborder also contains the only beetles where both sexes are paedogenic, &quot;Micromalthus debilis&quot;. Modern archostematan beetles are considered rare, but were more diverse during the Mesozoic. 

The term &quot;Archostemata&quot; is used more broadly by some authors to include both modern archostematans as well as stem-group beetles like &quot;protocoleopterans&quot;, which some modern archostematans closely resemble to due to their plesiomorphic morphology. Genetic research suggests that modern archostematans are a monophyletic group. Some genetic studies have recovered archostematans as the sister group of Myxophaga.

A 2009 paper argued that the poor diversity of modern Archostemata, compared with the staggering evolutionary success of most other Coleoptera lineages, could be due to the lower efficiency of the thoracic locomotor apparatus, the absence of
cryptonephric Malpighian tubules, and competition with other beetles more adapted to angiosperms.

==Taxonomy==
There are five extant families.

<doc id="799734" wikidata="Q317091" url="?curid=799734" title="Bellevue Palace, Germany">
<text>Bellevue Palace (, ), located in Berlin&#x27;s Tiergarten district, has been the official residence of the president of Germany since 1994. The schloss is situated on the banks of the Spree river, near the Berlin Victory Column, along the northern edge of the Großer Tiergarten park. Its namethe French for &quot;beautiful view&quot;derives from its scenic prospect over the Spree&#x27;s course.

== Overview ==
Designed by architect Michael Philipp Boumann (1747–1803), &quot;Schloss Bellevue&quot; was erected in 1786 as a residence for Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia, Master of the Knights of the Order of Saint John and youngest brother of King Frederick II of Prussia. There were preexisting structures on the site, including the manor house which King Frederick&#x27;s architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff had built for himself in 1743, which was demolished, and a leather factory on the Spree river waterfront which was converted into the right side-wing. The palace was named &quot;Bellevue&quot; as its view reached the tower of Schloss Charlottenburg before the viaduct of the Berlin Stadtbahn was built nearby in the 1880s. It was the first Neoclassical building in Germany, characterized by its Corinthian pilasters, with wings on either side (&quot;Ladies&#x27; wing&quot; and &quot;River Spree wing&quot;). The only room that kept its original decoration is a ballroom on the upper floor designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the architect of the Brandenburg Gate. The palace is surrounded by a park of about 20 hectares.

In 1843, King Frederick William IV of Prussia inherited &quot;Bellevue&quot; from Prince Augustus of Prussia, a son of the builder. In 1865 it became the residence of his niece Princess Alexandrine after her marriage to Duke William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. It served the royal and imperial princes of the Hohenzollern dynasty until the German Revolution of 1918–19. The last German Emperor Wilhelm II used it as a guest house as well as a private school for his seven children. 

The Free State of Prussia acquired the property from the former Emperor in 1928 and used it as a museum of ethnography during the 1930s before being renovated as a guest house for the Nazi government which had purchased it in 1938. However, from 1939, it was occupied by Otto Meissner, the head of the Office of the President of Germany. It was there that Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov stayed with his retinue during his visit to Berlin in November 1940. During World War II, the Palace was severely damaged by strategic bombing and in the 1945 Battle of Berlin, before being substantially refurbished in the 1950s. Inaugurated by President Theodor Heuss in 1959, it served as the secondary residence of the West German president, a &quot;pied-à-terre&quot; in West Berlin to supplement his primary residence at the Hammerschmidt Villa in Bonn. 

In 1986–87, Federal President Richard von Weizsäcker had the interior of the palace completely redesigned by the architect Otto Meitinger in order to adapt the rooms to the character of the external historical appearance, whereby the sequence of rooms was also restored according to plans from the time before the destruction. Weizsäcker had the palace furnished with part of the valuable Empire style furniture collection from Wilhelmshöhe Palace in Kassel as a permanent loan and initiated the exchange of paintings with German museums in order to present guests with classical and modern German art. However, two rooms have been preserved with their furnishings in the style of post-war modernism. In 1994, after German reunification, Weizsäcker made it his primary residence. 
A modern oval office building was built in 1998 in a section of the park near the palace to house the offices of the affiliated &quot;Bundespräsidialamt&quot; (&quot;Office of the Federal President&quot;), a federal agency. 

Roman Herzog, president from 1994 to 1999, remains the only officeholder who lived at &quot;Bellevue&quot; while incumbent. The palace was reconstructed again in 2004 and 2005 to replace ailing infrastructure; during this period, President Horst Köhler used nearby Charlottenburg Palace for representative purposes. &quot;Bellevue&quot; became the president&#x27;s primary official seat again in January 2006, but since then has not included living quarters. Instead, the federal president now lives in a government-owned villa in Dahlem, a suburban district of southwestern Berlin, which had previously been the Berlin lodging of the West-German chancellors since 1962.

== Presidential standard ==

Contrary to popular belief, the presidential standard is flown at the palace even on many days when the president is not in Berlin. It is lowered only when the president takes up official residence elsewhere – e.g. on the occasion of a state visit, when the standard is raised over a temporary residence abroad, or over the second residence at Villa Hammerschmidt. When away on vacation, &quot;Schloss Bellevue&quot; remains the official residence over which the standard is flown.

== Großer Tiergarten statues ==
In 1945, according to testimony reported in the 1995 documentary film &quot;On the Desperate Edge of Now&quot;, Berlin citizens buried statues of historical military figures from the Großer Tiergarten in the grounds of the palace to prevent their destruction. They were not recovered until 1993.

<text>YMB Sayar Tin (, ; 11 February 1894 – 8 August 1950) was a Burmese composer. He was one of three well known pre-war composers with the name Sayar Tin. The others were and . He is best known for composing &quot;Kaba Ma Kyei&quot;, the national anthem of Myanmar.

==Early life==
Tin was born in Mandalay on 11 February 1894 (7th waxing of Tabodwe 1255 ME) to Daw Thein and her husband U Yan Aung, a former official in the service of the last Burmese king Thibaw. He had one elder sister and one younger sister.

After finishing high school at age 17, Tin worked as a school teacher in a private school for the next three years. In his leisure time Tin took up playing his concertina, exploring its sounds, and studying traditional Burmese music.

==Musical career==
In 1918, Tin founded his own private school, the &quot;Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist School&quot; in Mandalay, and came to be known as YMB &quot;Sayar&quot; Tin. (Sayar in Burmese means &quot;teacher&quot;). His school&#x27;s musical troupe performed free of charge at charity events and weddings.

In 1930, Tin closed down his school and moved to Yangon where his songs had been recorded, and used in films. Tin met up with an old classmate &quot;Tha Khin&quot; Ba Thaung, and joined his political movement, Dobama Asiayone (We Burmese Association).

==&quot;Gabar Ma Kyay&quot;==
Tin composed Do Bama Song (တို့ဗမာသီချင်း), in 1930, with Ba Thaung supplying the patriotic lyrics. Tin himself gave the first ceremonial rendition of the song on the flat ground of Shwedagon Pagoda at 5:00 pm on 20 July 1930. After the ceremony, Tin was imprisoned by British officers, who accused him of inciting insurgents. He was later released in 1946. In 1942, Do Bama Song was adopted as the national anthem of the State of Burma. In 1947, it was used as a template for the National Anthem of the Union of Burma, for which Tin was awarded Rs.1,000/-. The Burmese government awarded him the title &quot;Wunna Kyawhtin&quot; (the beautiful-famous) on the Independence Day, 4 January 1948.

==Death==
Tin died of tuberculosis on 8 August 1950 and was buried in Yangon. Tin had composed over 4,000 songs.

<doc id="799747" wikidata="Q1180890" url="?curid=799747" title="Dead or Alive (franchise)">
<text>is a Japanese media franchise centered on a series of fighting games developed by Team Ninja and published by Koei Tecmo (formerly Tecmo). The gameplay of the series is primarily composed of fast-paced hand-to-hand combat in a 3-Dimensional playing field that began with the first game released in 1996, followed by five main sequels, numerous updates, spin-offs, printed media, a film adaptation, and merchandise.

The series revolves around the events of the Dead or Alive World Combat Championship, an international martial arts tournament in which fighters from across the globe participate for the title of world champion and large cash prizes. The tournaments are held by the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee (DOATEC). The conflict between the ninja competitors and DOATEC&#x27;s personnel serves as the main focus of the series.

&quot;Dead or Alive&quot; has been a critical and commercial success, having been well-praised for its impressive fighting system, beautiful graphics, and interactive environments. The franchise has received numerous awards and accolades. Its sequels such as &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; and &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; received universal acclaim and are considered milestone titles in the fighting genre and gaming. Several characters of the series have made appearances and are referenced in other games while several games of the series have also been featured and referenced in other media. &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;″s success sparked a renewal interest in Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series. As of 2019, the franchise has sold over 10.05 million units worldwide. The franchise sales and free-to-play downloads combined totaled over 24.05 million units.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series focuses on fast-paced gameplay in a three-dimensional playing field. Like other modern fighting games that attempt to emulate real life martial arts, &quot;DOA&quot;&#x27;s input system is designed so controls correspond to the game character&#x27;s actions; if the character moves forward with a punch, the controls most likely would include the punch input and pressing forward on the directional pad. In comparison to others in the fighting game genre, such as &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, the series places emphasis on striking characters quickly and efficiently. There is an emphasis on quick combos and air-juggles since the game&#x27;s countering system and fast recovery times prevent slow, technical sets of moves in most instances. The series controls also make the instances of speed and simplicity more congruent with the focus of timing and combos in mind, as the commands for basic attacks are widely considered more straightforward than most video games. There is only one button for punch, kick, throw and guard, with the player rarely having to combine more than two different input schemes together at a time.

One of the series&#x27; most innovative additions to the genre is its countering system, officially known as the &quot;Triangle System&quot;. The basic gameplay of the series is based on the Triangle System with three basic actions: Blows, Throws, and Holds; Blows beat Throws, Throws beat Holds, and Holds beat Blows. Beginning with the original &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, players could tap the guard button and a direction corresponding with the anticipated attack, which would do a powerful counterattack known as Counter Hold. Counter Holds must be timed correctly and match the direction of the attack being countered. If the attack targets the torso, the player must also take into account whether the attack is a punch or a kick. The input for Holds has changed several times over the course of the series with the latest games adopting a 4-point Hold system, and some games offering the option to change the input type. This countering system further sets &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; apart as skilled players can identify combo patterns on defense and counter accordingly, which in turn encourages the opponent to adjust their offense on the fly to be less predictable and avoid being countered.
The series uses interactive features that appear in certain fighting arenas, called &quot;Danger Zones&quot;. Fighters caught in a Danger Zone will take extra damage, giving the attacker a slight advantage. These environmental hazards can be anything from Falls to Explosives to Breakable Structures. If a fighter has low health, being trapped in a Danger Zone is more likely to knock them out than a normal attack, although in certain titles, elements such as falls cannot do this, and instead just leave the fighter with very low health.

In the first &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, stages were simply fighting ring arenas and the Danger Zones were just explosive outer edges of the arena floors. In &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, stage environments became larger and multi-tiered and the original Danger Zone was replaced with more fully interactive ones such as Falls off the Edge, Walls, Electrically Charged Walls, Explosive Walls, Breakable Walls and Windows. Players are also offered the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background.

Since &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, the series has implemented its Tag team fighting system, allowing characters to switch back and forth instantly for combo attacks and even attack simultaneously when timed correctly. The Tag Mode also included special throws unique to certain pairs of characters called &quot;Tag Throws&quot;, and the mode allows for the participation of four players, something not very common in the fighting game genre. &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; introduced the &quot;Attack Change&quot; feature in the Tag mechanics where the fighting character can switch places with a partner, in which the character jumping in can then unleash an attack while jumping in. Since &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, Tag matches can be selected in the other game modes.

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; improved upon the gameplay and graphics in superior detail compared to the previous games. The game offered unrestricted 3D-axis movements with better sidestepping, giving players the ability to dodge most attacks with a sidestep. The game added a new feature in its Sparring Mode called &quot;Exercise&quot; also known as &quot;Command Training&quot;, an automatic command tutorial that teaches players how to perform attacks. The game expanded on the concept of multi-tiered environments, pushing the range of the stage sizes larger than that of its predecessors.

&quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; introduced the &quot;Bounce Combo&quot; system where players can perform further attacks to opponents who are bouncing off the floor or ground, and can also performed attacks on opponents while they are down. Moving Obstacles were introduced in certain stages as a type of Danger Zone that causes damage to fighters who are hit by them and using a counter hold at the right timing can help players avoid being hit by them. Jumping over non-moving Obstacles and performing flying attacks while jumping over them was also introduced. &quot;Dead or Alive: Dimensions&quot; utilizes the Nintendo 3DS bottom touchscreen in addition to the normal control system, offering optional touchscreen-based controls by tapping a move set to execute Blow combos, Throws, and Holds. Since &quot;Dimensions&quot;, the series supports in-game frame data that can be displayed during Training Mode.

&quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; uses a revamped control system and features a more cinematic experience, especially with regards to Danger Zone effects. &quot;Power Blow&quot; is a triggered powerful attack that can enable the player that is low on health to knock the opponent character away in a selected direction, possibly initiating a cinematic quick time event called Cliffhanger. The game&#x27;s new Critical System features Critical Stuns, Critical Combos, and Critical Bursts. &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate&quot; further added the vertical Power Launcher and an extensive Tutorial mode. &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Plus&quot; for the PlayStation Vita features optional touchscreen-based controls from first-person perspective.

&quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; introduces both the Gauge System and costume customization. The Gauge System consists of the &quot;Break Gauge&quot;, which allows numerous special moves to be performed depending on how full the gauge is, such as Fatal Rushes, Side Attacks, Break Holds, and Break Blows. The game also features an enhanced Bounce Combo system that allows players to bound their opponent on the ground for a finisher, with different inputs depending on the character.

The spin-off &quot;Xtreme&quot; series is mostly based around two-on-two matches of beach volleyball and casino gambling. After the original &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot;, the available activities have expanded to include the likes of watercraft racing and beach photography, while emphasizing the series&#x27; breast physics.

==Plot and characters==
The &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series depicts a collection of skilled martial artists in a worldwide competition named the &quot;Dead or Alive World Combat Championship&quot;, or simply &quot;the Dead or Alive tournament&quot;. DOATEC (Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee), a massive corporation with unknown motives, holds the fighting competition in arenas ranging from the North Pole to the Amazon rain forest.

&quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, the first game in the series, introduced the initial characters and their reasons for entering the tournament. For example, Zack enters for profit, while Kasumi, a runaway female ninja of the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan and the series&#x27; main protagonist, enters the tournament to seek revenge against Raidou who crippled her brother Hayate. Kasumi wins the first DOA tournament and kills Raidou, however, due to her status as a runaway, the strict laws of ninja society prevent Kasumi from returning to her village, and she becomes a hunted fugitive.

&quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; is set less than a year later, as Tengu escapes from his world and threatens the human world. Fame Douglas, the founder and CEO of DOATEC was assassinated shortly after the first tournament, causing DOATEC to fall under a new leadership. Kasumi was kidnapped by DOATEC and was used as a subject in DOATEC&#x27;s bio-weapon experiment, Alpha. Kasumi&#x27;s brother Hayate, previously injured by Raidou, is also kidnapped and was used as a subject in DOATEC&#x27;s bio-weapon experiment, Epsilon. New fighters include Ein, Helena Douglas, Kasumi Alpha, Leon, and Tengu. Eventually, Ryu Hayabusa kills Tengu and wins the second tournament.

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, takes place after the defeat of Tengu. The game&#x27;s plot concerns a secret goal of DOATEC&#x27;s mad scientist Victor Donovan to produce the ultimate human weapon, called the Omega Project. Through the Epsilon and Alpha stages, it was initially believed that DOATEC captures and wipes the Mugen Tenshin&#x27;s Hajin Mon ninja Genra&#x27;s memory. In reality, as revealed in a retold-based game &quot;Dead or Alive: Dimensions&quot;, Genra betrayed Mugen Tenshin to align himself with DOATEC, having revealed himself to be responsible for Tengu&#x27;s invasion on Earth, then voluntarily becomes a subject for his transformation into Omega. A third tournament is later held to test Genra&#x27;s Omega abilities. In the end, Kasumi&#x27;s half-sister Ayane kills her former master and wins the third tournament. The game introduces five more fighters, the first playable appearance of Hayate, and the brand new fighters Brad Wong, Christie, Hitomi, and Omega.

&quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; again explores DOATEC&#x27;s attempts to create a powerful clone of Kasumi with the Alpha Project. The various fighters discover the true nature of DOATEC and set out to stop it. Helena takes over DOATEC as its new president and CEO, determined to fight against the corruption within the organization and change DOATEC for the better. Helena wins the fourth tournament and decides to give the title to Zack. The game introduces four new fighters, Alpha-152, Eliot, Kokoro, and La Mariposa.

The fifth game, &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, is set two years later. DOATEC is newly reformed with Helena still in control and Zack appearing to be an employee. Donovan forms a new organization called MIST to continue the Alpha Project. Jann Lee beats Hitomi in the last round of the fifth tournament, thus winning. However, Jann Lee still felt that there is one person whom Jann Lee wants to defeat in order for him to be a true winner, Rig, who at first has an amnesia, but presumably ruse, and calling Donovan, &quot;dad&quot;. Meanwhile, Kasumi, Ryu, and Ayane, with the help from Helena, fight to destroy the Alpha project and stop Donovan.

Continuing to &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot;, DOATEC and Mugen Tenshin discover that MIST is after the fifth tournament qualifier participant Honoka, due to her having a similar power signature as Raidou, causing them to keep an eye on her in different ways. Even worse, by the time the sixth tournament begins, Rig is found out to be indeed amnesiac; he was unknowingly being implanted with a hypnotic suggestion by MIST that will brainwash him to serve them under the alias &quot;Victor Donovan Jr.&quot;, causing Bass and Jann Lee to worry and become suspicious of Rig&#x27;s current situation. For the final tournament match, Jann Lee is once again officially a winner, but he was unofficially defeated by a newcomer, Diego. Ayane and Honoka are soon kidnapped by MIST and coerced into unwillingly reviving Raidou, their biological father, as an undead cyber ninja demon. As her older-half-sister Honoka is still weakened, Ayane teams up with Kasumi and Hayate to kill the revived Raidou once and for all, leaving no trace of him behind. Helena, who arrived at one of MIST&#x27;s hidden laboratory to secure the place, approaches a young scientist who act as Lisa&#x27;s replacement and is responsible for Raidou&#x27; resurrection, NiCO. Although NiCO attempts to revive Helena&#x27;s mother, Maria, Helena rejects her plan, causing NiCO to escape from her.

== History ==
The series was created by its original director and producer Tomonobu Itagaki after he became a programmer for Tecmo in 1992. During the mid-1990s, Tecmo was in financial trouble and was in need of a hit to boost sagging game sales. In this vein, Itagaki made a wager with the management of company, including the vice president later turned president of the company, Junji Nakamura, assuring he would create a video game that would garner a fan base. Tomonobu Itagaki stated how he was dissatisfied with the way modern fighting games at the time were presented; he missed the old arcade-style of play and had another vision for the fighting game genre. Following the initial working titles of &quot;Ninja Fighter&quot; and &quot;Poligon Fighter&quot;, he named the series &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; to demonstrate both the company and game&#x27;s fail or succeed status, and proceeded to form a division in the company named Team Ninja. The first &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; game was a success in helping Tecmo overcome their financial problems, and in turn, helped &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; become a franchise. Itagaki&#x27;s inspiration for the series derived from the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series in Japan as the management asked Itagaki to create a game similar to &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. Inspiration also derived from the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series in Japan, and the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series in America, with &quot;DOA&quot;&#x27;s sexual appeal drawn from the former series, and the ability to knock opponents off landscapes from the latter. When asked how he wished the series would contribute to the fighting genre, Itagaki replied: &quot;I want people to remember &quot;DOA&quot; as a game that was very aggressive and combative. As to [...] how it contributed to the fighting genre – I look at it as something similar to how sushi was released in this country and became mainstream. You know, like, some people like graphics, some people like animation, some like flashy character design and so forth. Through &quot;DOA&quot;, we want to reach out to those people and become somewhat of a mainstream game.&quot;

The sequels, &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, and &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; brought much success to the franchise, both critically and commercially. The success of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; sparked a renewal interest in Tecmo&#x27;s classic (but at that time long dormant) &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series. After &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; was revived in 2004 by Itagaki and Team Ninja, they began linking it back with &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, setting the franchises within the same universe with overlapping characters and events. As it was a complete reboot of the series and did not continue the canon of any previous &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; titles, the developers were free to do with the universe and its characters as it saw fit, and so the game was implemented into the &quot;DOA&quot; universe, setting up &quot;Ninja Gaiden I&quot;, &quot;Dragon Sword&quot; and &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot; as prequels to the first &quot;DOA&quot;. In addition, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, who had already been on the roster of every &quot;DOA&quot; fighting game since the beginning, plays a major role in that series&#x27; overarching storyline, which has been fleshed out during the development of the subsequent &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; titles. Having featured Ryu in most of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; games during development of the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; reboot, Team Ninja then included the characters Ayane and Kasumi in most of the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games. Conversely, several characters from &quot;DOA&quot; have roles in the rebooted &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series, initially only appearing during story sequences but becoming fully playable characters in special modes in the later games. Rachel and Momiji, characters originating from the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; series, appear in updated versions of &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;.

Before his departure from Team Ninja, Itagaki stated in 2006 that he had a new &quot;DOA&quot; game planned, but in a 2008 interview he said about the series: &quot;This is another area that my closest colleagues and I all agree that we were able to achieve the definitive fighting game with &quot;DOA4&quot;. So we&#x27;re not looking to extend the series at this point.&quot; In a released statement on June 3, 2008, Itagaki announced his resignation from Tecmo (July 1, 2008) due to business troubles with then president of Tecmo, Yoshimi Yasuda. Itagaki stated that this would unfortunately lead to the end of production for the game and its series. However, Tecmo replied with the announcement that Team Ninja would not be dissolved upon Itagaki&#x27;s departure, stating that both the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; franchises would remain in production and that some projects were already underway.

Soon after, Tecmo would merge with fellow video game publisher, Koei, to form Tecmo Koei Games, now known as Koei Tecmo. The role of Team Ninja leader and series producer was taken over by &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; planner and tester, Yosuke Hayashi, while game designer and planner, Yohei Shimbori, takes over as director of the series. &quot;Dead or Alive Paradise&quot; was the first &quot;DOA&quot; console game not developed by the original Team Ninja. &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; was created in partnership with Sega AM2 of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; fame, featuring several guest characters from that series. Free-to-play versions of the games &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; and &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; were released to attract new fans to the series and to introduce more people to the fighting genre, hoping to help to bring back the fighting games&#x27; golden era of the 1990s. On March 31, 2021, director Shimbori announced his departure from Team Ninja to pursue other opportunities, while his position of director was taken over by Hayashi. In 2022, Hayashi would step down as Team Ninja head to become the Koei Tecmo entertainment division&#x27;s general manager, with Fumihiko Yasuda serving as Team Ninja&#x27;s current head.

Since 2019, no new games in the fighting game series have been released. At the end of a presentation by Koei Tecmo at G-Star 2022, it was hinted that the franchise might be rebooted again in the near future. The rumors were subsequently disconfirmed by Team Ninja creative director, Tom Lee. In a February 2024 interview with Team Ninja department manager, Masakazu Hirayama, he stated that they are is considering the possibility of returning to the series, saying that &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; is an important IP to them. When asked about introducing a guest character from &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; to &quot;Tekken 8&quot;, producer Katsuhiro Harada cited this content drought as the main reason he doesn&#x27;t see a collaboration happening.

At the Tokyo Game Show 2024, Koei Tecmo announced &quot;Venus Vacation Prism: Dead or Alive Xtreme&quot;, a new entry in the &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme&quot; spin-off series, set for release in early 2025.

<doc id="799760" wikidata="Q1334846" url="?curid=799760" title="Mahalanobis distance">
<text>The Mahalanobis distance is a measure of the distance between a point formula_1 and a distribution formula_2, introduced by P. C. Mahalanobis in 1936. The mathematical details of Mahalanobis distance first appeared in the Journal of The Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1936. Mahalanobis&#x27;s definition was prompted by the problem of identifying the similarities of skulls based on measurements (the earliest work related to similarities of skulls are from 1922 and another later work is from 1927). R.C. Bose later obtained the sampling distribution of Mahalanobis distance, under the assumption of equal dispersion.

It is a multivariate generalization of the square of the standard score formula_3: how many standard deviations away formula_1 is from the mean of formula_2. This distance is zero for formula_1 at the mean of formula_2 and grows as formula_1 moves away from the mean along each principal component axis. If each of these axes is re-scaled to have unit variance, then the Mahalanobis distance corresponds to standard Euclidean distance in the transformed space. The Mahalanobis distance is thus unitless, scale-invariant, and takes into account the correlations of the data set.

==Definition==
Given a probability distribution formula_9 on formula_10, with mean formula_11 and positive semi-definite covariance matrix formula_12, the Mahalanobis distance of a point formula_13 from formula_9 is formula_15Given two points formula_16 and formula_17 in formula_10, the Mahalanobis distance between them with respect to formula_9 isformula_20which means that formula_21.

Since formula_12 is positive semi-definite, so is formula_23, thus the square roots are always defined.

We can find useful decompositions of the squared Mahalanobis distance that help to explain some reasons for the outlyingness of multivariate observations and also provide a graphical tool for identifying outliers.

By the spectral theorem, formula_12 can be decomposed as formula_25 for some real formula_26 matrix. One choice for formula_27 is the symmetric square root of formula_12, which is the standard deviation matrix. This gives us the equivalent definitionformula_29where formula_30 is the Euclidean norm. That is, the Mahalanobis distance is the Euclidean distance after a whitening transformation.

The existence of formula_27 is guaranteed by the spectral theorem, but it is not unique. Different choices have different theoretical and practical advantages.

In practice, the distribution formula_9 is usually the sample distribution from a set of IID samples from an underlying unknown distribution, so formula_33 is the sample mean, and formula_12 is the covariance matrix of the samples.

When the affine span of the samples is not the entire formula_10, the covariance matrix would not be positive-definite, which means the above definition would not work. However, in general, the Mahalanobis distance is preserved under any full-rank affine transformation of the affine span of the samples. So in case the affine span is not the entire formula_10, the samples can be first orthogonally projected to formula_37, where formula_38 is the dimension of the affine span of the samples, then the Mahalanobis distance can be computed as usual.

==Intuitive explanation==

Consider the problem of estimating the probability that a test point in &quot;N&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space belongs to a set, where we are given sample points that definitely belong to that set. Our first step would be to find the centroid or center of mass of the sample points. Intuitively, the closer the point in question is to this center of mass, the more likely it is to belong to the set.

However, we also need to know if the set is spread out over a large range or a small range, so that we can decide whether a given distance from the center is noteworthy or not. The simplistic approach is to estimate the standard deviation of the distances of the sample points from the center of mass. If the distance between the test point and the center of mass is less than one standard deviation, then we might conclude that it is highly probable that the test point belongs to the set. The further away it is, the more likely that the test point should not be classified as belonging to the set.

This intuitive approach can be made quantitative by defining the normalized distance between the test point and the set to be formula_39, which reads: formula_40. By plugging this into the normal distribution, we can derive the probability of the test point belonging to the set.

The drawback of the above approach was that we assumed that the sample points are distributed about the center of mass in a spherical manner. Were the distribution to be decidedly non-spherical, for instance ellipsoidal, then we would expect the probability of the test point belonging to the set to depend not only on the distance from the center of mass, but also on the direction. In those directions where the ellipsoid has a short axis the test point must be closer, while in those where the axis is long the test point can be further away from the center.

Putting this on a mathematical basis, the ellipsoid that best represents the set&#x27;s probability distribution can be estimated by building the covariance matrix of the samples. The Mahalanobis distance is the distance of the test point from the center of mass divided by the width of the ellipsoid in the direction of the test point.

==Normal distributions==

For a normal distribution in any number of dimensions, the probability density of an observation formula_16 is uniquely determined by the Mahalanobis distance formula_42:
: formula_43
Specifically, formula_44 follows the chi-squared distribution with formula_38 degrees of freedom, where formula_38 is the number of dimensions of the normal distribution. If the number of dimensions is 2, for example, the probability of a particular calculated formula_42 being less than some threshold formula_48 is formula_49. To determine a threshold to achieve a particular probability, formula_50, use formula_51, for 2 dimensions. For number of dimensions other than 2, the cumulative chi-squared distribution should be consulted.

In a normal distribution, the region where the Mahalanobis distance is less than one (i.e. the region inside the ellipsoid at distance one) is exactly the region where the probability distribution is concave.

The Mahalanobis distance is proportional, for a normal distribution, to the square root of the negative log-likelihood (after adding a constant so the minimum is at zero).

== Other forms of multivariate location and scatter ==

The sample mean and covariance matrix can be quite sensitive to outliers, therefore other approaches for calculating the multivariate location and scatter of data are also commonly used when calculating the Mahalanobis distance. The Minimum Covariance Determinant approach estimates multivariate location and scatter from a subset numbering formula_52 data points that has the smallest variance-covariance matrix determinant. The Minimum Volume Ellipsoid approach is similar to the Minimum Covariance Determinant approach in that it works with a subset of size formula_52 data points, but the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid estimates multivariate location and scatter from the ellipsoid of minimal volume that encapsulates the formula_52 data points. Each method varies in its definition of the distribution of the data, and therefore produces different Mahalanobis distances. The Minimum Covariance Determinant and Minimum Volume Ellipsoid approaches are more robust to samples that contain outliers, while the sample mean and covariance matrix tends to be more reliable with small and biased data sets.

==Relationship to normal random variables==
In general, given a normal (Gaussian) random variable formula_55 with variance formula_56 and mean formula_57, any other normal random variable formula_58 (with mean formula_59 and variance formula_60) can be defined in terms of formula_55 by the equation formula_62 Conversely, to recover a normalized random variable from any normal random variable, one can typically solve for formula_63. If we square both sides, and take the square-root, we will get an equation for a metric that looks a lot like the Mahalanobis distance:

formula_64

The resulting magnitude is always non-negative and varies with the distance of the data from the mean, attributes that are convenient when trying to define a model for the data.

==Relationship to leverage==

Mahalanobis distance is closely related to the leverage statistic, formula_52, but has a different scale:

formula_66

==Applications==
Mahalanobis distance is widely used in cluster analysis and classification techniques. It is closely related to Hotelling&#x27;s T-square distribution used for multivariate statistical testing and Fisher&#x27;s linear discriminant analysis that is used for supervised classification.

In order to use the Mahalanobis distance to classify a test point as belonging to one of &quot;N&quot; classes, one first estimates the covariance matrix of each class, usually based on samples known to belong to each class. Then, given a test sample, one computes the Mahalanobis distance to each class, and classifies the test point as belonging to that class for which the Mahalanobis distance is minimal.

Mahalanobis distance and leverage are often used to detect outliers, especially in the development of linear regression models. A point that has a greater Mahalanobis distance from the rest of the sample population of points is said to have higher leverage since it has a greater influence on the slope or coefficients of the regression equation. Mahalanobis distance is also used to determine multivariate outliers. Regression techniques can be used to determine if a specific case within a sample population is an outlier via the combination of two or more variable scores. Even for normal distributions, a point can be a multivariate outlier even if it is not a univariate outlier for any variable (consider a probability density concentrated along the line formula_67, for example), making Mahalanobis distance a more sensitive measure than checking dimensions individually.

Mahalanobis distance has also been used in ecological niche modelling, as the convex elliptical shape of the distances relates well to the concept of the fundamental niche.

Another example of usage is in finance, where Mahalanobis distance has been used to compute an indicator called the &quot;turbulence index&quot;, which is a statistical measure of financial markets abnormal behaviour. An implementation as a Web API of this indicator is available online.

==Software implementations==
Many programming languages and statistical packages, such as R, Python, etc., include implementations of Mahalanobis distance.

<doc id="799777" wikidata="Q926633" url="?curid=799777" title="Guṇa">
<text> () is a concept in Hinduism, which can be translated as &quot;quality, peculiarity, attribute, property&quot;.

The concept is originally notable as a feature of Samkhya philosophy. The guṇas are now a key concept in nearly all schools of Hindu philosophy. There are three guṇas (&quot;triguṇa&quot;), according to this worldview, that have always been and continue to be present in all things and beings in the world. These three &quot;guṇas&quot; are called: &#x27; (goodness, calmness, harmonious),&#x27; (passion, activity, movement), and &quot;&quot; (ignorance, inertia, laziness). All of these three &quot;guṇas&quot; are present in everyone and everything; it is the proportion that is different, according to Hindu worldview. The interplay of these &quot;guṇas&quot; defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.

In some contexts, it may mean &quot;a subdivision, species, kind, quality&quot;, or an operational principle or tendency of something or someone. In human behavior studies, &quot;Guna&quot; means personality, innate nature and psychological attributes of an individual.

Like many technical terms in other languages, &quot;guṇa&quot; can be difficult to encapsulate with a single English word. Its original and common meaning is a thread, implying the original materials that weave together to make up reality. The usual, but approximate translation in common usage is &quot;a quality&quot;.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Guna&quot; appears in many ancient and medieval Indian texts. Depending on the context, it means:
* string or thread, rope, sinew, chord (music, vowel phonology and arts literature)
* virtue, merit, excellence (dharma and soteriological literature)
* quality, peculiarity, tendency, attribute, property, species (sastras, sutras, the Epics, food and analytical literature)

===The root and origins===
Guṇa is both a root and a word in Sanskrit. Its different context-driven meanings are derived from either the root or the word. In verse VI.36 of Nirukta by Yāska, a 1st millennium BC text on Sanskrit grammar and language that preceded Panini, &quot;Guṇa&quot; is declared to be derived from another root &quot;Gaṇa&quot;, which means &quot;to count, enumerate&quot;. This meaning has led to its use in speciation, subdivision, classification of anything by peculiarity, attribute or property. This meaning has also led to its use with prefixes such as &quot;Dviguṇa&quot; (twofold), &quot;Triguṇa&quot; (threefold) and so on.

In other contexts, such as phonology, grammar and arts, &quot;Guṇa-&quot; takes the meaning of &quot;āmantraṇā&quot; (आमन्त्रणा, addressing, invitation) or &quot;abhyāsa&quot; (अभ्यास, habit, practice). In the Mahabharata Book 6 Chapter 2, the meaning of &quot;guṇa&quot; similarly comes in the sense of addressing each part (the root implying āmantraṇā), and thereby it means &quot;avayava&quot; (अवयव, member, subdivision, portion). In Sanskrit treatises on food and cooking, &quot;guṇa&quot; means quality, tendency and nature of ingredient. Ancient South Indian commentators, such as Lingayasurin, explain that the meaning of &quot;guṇa&quot; as &quot;thread, string&quot; comes from the root &quot;guṇa-&quot; in the sense of repetition (&quot;abhyāsa&quot;), while the Telugu commentator Mallinatha explains the root &quot;guṇa-&quot; is to be understood in Sisupalavadha as &quot;āmredana&quot; (आम्रेडन, reiteration, repetition). Larson and Bhattacharya suggest that the &quot;thread&quot; metaphor relates to that which connects and runs between what we objectively observe to the tattva (तत्त्व, elementary property, principle, invisible essence) of someone or something.

In the context of philosophy, morality and understanding nature, &quot;Guna-&quot; with more dental &quot;na&quot; takes the meaning of addressing quality, substance, tendency and property. In abstract discussion, it includes all hues of qualities – desirable, neutral or undesirable; but if unspecified, it is assumed with good faith to be good and divine in Indian philosophy. Thus, &quot;Guṇi&quot; from the root &quot;Guṇa-&quot; means someone or something with &quot;divine qualities&quot;, as in Svetasvatara Upanishad hymn VI.2.

== The gunas under various philosophies ==

Innate qualities and tendencies are key ancient concepts in Indian literature. Maitrayaniya Upanishad is one of the earliest texts making an explicit reference to Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and linking them to their &quot;Guna&quot; – as creator/activity, preserver/purity, destroyer/recycler respectively. The idea of three types of &quot;guṇa&quot;, innate nature and forces that together transform and keep changing the world is, however, found in numerous earlier and later Indian texts.

=== Samkhya school of Hinduism ===
In Samkhya philosophy, a is one of three &quot;attributes, tendencies, qualities&quot;: sattva, rajas and tamas. This category of s has been widely adopted by various schools of Hinduism for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena. The three qualities are:
* &quot;Sattva&quot; is the of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, universal-ism, holism, construction, creativity, positivity, peacefulness, and virtue.
* &quot;Rajas&quot; is the of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, self-centeredness, egoism, individualization, drivenness, movement, and dynamism.
* &quot;Tamas&quot; is the of imbalance, disorder, chaos, anxiety, impurity, destruction, delusion, negativity, dullness or inactivity, apathy, inertia or lethargy, violence, viciousness, and ignorance.

In Indian philosophy, these qualities are not considered present in an either-or fashion. Rather, everyone and everything has all three, only in different proportions and in different contexts. The living being or substance is viewed as the net result of the joint effect of these three qualities.

According to Samkya school, no one and nothing is either purely Sattvik or purely Rajasik or purely Tamasik. One&#x27;s nature and behavior constitute a complex interplay of all three guṇas, in varying degrees. In some, the conduct is Rajasik with significant influence of Sattvik guṇa; in some it is Rajasik with significant influence of Tamasik guṇa, and so on.

The balance of Gunas of everything and everyone can change and does. However, change in one quality faces inertia from other two qualities in Indian worldview. Change needs internal or external influence or reinforcement, as knowledge and force to transform. The force to change comes from the &quot;Rajas&quot; guṇa, the Sattva guṇa empowers one towards harmonious and constructive change, while Tamas guṇa checks or retards the process.

In Indian mythology, Vishnu is envisioned with more &quot;Sattva&quot;, Brahma with more &quot;Rajas&quot;, and Shiva seen with all three &quot;Gunas&quot;.

=== Nyaya school of Hinduism ===
In Nyaya (Generality or common features) school of Hinduism, there is extensive debate on what &quot;Guna&quot; means, and whether quality is innate, subjective or describable. Early scholars of this school identified 17 qualities, which later scholars expanded to 24 . Different scholars of this school list the 24 differently; for example, Bhasarvajna disallows 6 of the 24 commonly accepted by the ancient scholars. The most commonly accepted list is: color, taste, smell, touch, number, contact, disjunction, farness, nearness, dimension, separateness, knowledge, pleasure, frustration, desire, hatred, effort, weight, fluidity, viscosity, dispositional tendency, merit, demerit, and sound.

Nyaya school considers quality as non-repeatable, a conceptual theme not found in Western philosophy where &quot;quality&quot; is presumed to be repeatable. It is also not found in some parallel schools of Hinduism. Repeatability means that the white in one object is same as white in other object, and white means the same thing. Nyaya scholars hold that &quot;whiteness&quot; is a guṇa of &quot;white&quot;, but that is different from &quot;whiteness&quot; of an object or living being. To them, white has many hues and the &quot;whiteness&quot; is subjective.

In Laksanavali, an ancient Indian text by Udayana, &quot;Guna&quot; is discussed with more nuance. For example, he writes, &quot;quality of earth&quot; is specific only if it meets three conditions: it occurs in earth, does not occur in anything that is not earthy, and be a distinctive quality that cannot be described as combination of other qualities.

=== Vaisheshika school of Hinduism ===
In Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, which is most related to Nyaya school, states that our awareness, understanding and judgments of any person and thing in the world is relational. All relations, holds this school of Hinduism, is dyadic between &quot;anuyogin&quot; (referend) and &quot;pratiyogin&quot; (referent). &quot;Guna&quot; (quality) is considered one of the seven &quot;padārtha&quot; (category) of relations. The others are: inherence (&quot;samavaya&quot;), being (&quot;bhava&quot;), genus (&quot;samanya&quot;), species (&quot;vishesha&quot;), substance (&quot;dravya&quot;) and motion/action (&quot;karman&quot;). Unlike Vaisheshika, Nyaya considers inherence as subset of &quot;guṇa&quot; (quality).

Gangesha, a Nyaya scholar, suggests a somewhat different theory, stating that our awareness is of two types – true and false. True awareness is produced when we seek to observe some excellence (&quot;guṇa&quot;) in its cause, while false awareness results from observing fault (&quot;dosha&quot;) in its cause. In other words, in Gangesha&#x27;s perspective, the observer&#x27;s state of mind and attitude affects relational awareness.

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
Chapters 2, 3, 7, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of Bhagavad Gita discuss &quot;Guna&quot;. Verse 17.2 refers to the three Guna – sattvic, rajasic and tamasic – as innate nature (psychology or personality of an individual). Sattvic guṇa is one driven by what is pure, truth, compassionate, without craving, doing the right because it is right, positive and good. Tamasic guṇa is one driven by what is impure, dark, destructive, aimed to hurt another, contemptuous, negative and vicious. Rajasic guṇa is one that is ego-driven, out of personal passion, active, ostentatious, seeking the approval of others.

In Chapters 17 and 18, Bhagavad Gita illustrates various items and actions by their three &quot;Guna&quot;. For example, three types of charity are discussed, and what makes charity Sattvic, Rajasic or Tamasic. Similarly, food, relationships, knowledge and actions are detailed in terms of the three &quot;Guna&quot;. In Chapter 18, for example:

Similarly, knowledge that is attached to object of action, without concern for understanding the cause, without concern for purpose or significance, is Tamasic knowledge; knowledge that is segregated, that considers everything unconnected, individualistic and meaningless is Rajasic; knowledge that sees one being in all beings, that seeks the whole, a unity in diversity, and similarities in the divided components is Sattvic.

Furthermore, in Chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna advises Arjuna to transcend the three modes of existence and other forms of dualism.

== Guna in theory of ethics ==
&quot;Guna&quot; is one of the four important elements in the framework of ethical theories in Indian philosophy. Bommer et al. suggest that ethical/non-ethical behavior is an outcome of individual attributes, personal environment, social environment and institutional rules and laws. &quot;Guna&quot; theory is the ancient Indian philosophy on individual attributes, while the theories of Dharma and Ashramas address the personal and social environment, as well as part of its institutional framework. Guna theory, states Crawford, represents a hierarchical theory of values, where the relative order of hierarchy is suggested to vary within each individual along with the relative proportion of each &quot;guṇa&quot;. The interplay of three &quot;guṇas&quot; affect an individual&#x27;s values, and in Hindu worldview, these values affect individual&#x27;s actions, as well as the happiness and serenity experienced by the individual. The &quot;guṇas&quot; are not considered static and set. Hindu literature, such as the Bhagavad Gita, state it to be dynamic and changeable with knowledge, introspection and understanding of &quot;sva-dharma&quot;. Realizing one&#x27;s &quot;sva-dharma&quot; and Self is emphasized in Indian ethical theories. The highest state of existence and bliss, in Advaita school of Hinduism for example, is &quot;jivanmukti&quot; (Self-realization) and moksha.

&quot;Guna&quot; theory&#x27;s perspective on values constituting human personality is unique yet congruent with other ethical theories.

== Guna in cosmology ==
Samkhya cosmology combines the three with primal matter (universe, Prakrti). These are present in all things and beings in the world, and it is their interplay that defines the physical and psychological character and nature. They serve as the fundamental operating principles or &#x27;tendencies&#x27; of which are called: &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;. When any of the &quot;guṇa&quot; is out of balance in a being or object, the Samkhya school suggests that a pattern of evolution starts, affecting not only itself but its environment. Purusha, or consciousness, is considered separate from Prakriti and changeless.

== Guna in other contexts ==

=== Sanskrit grammar ===
In the Sanskrit grammatical tradition (Vyakarana), &quot;&quot; refers to a set of normal-length vowels that are less reduced than the basic set (in modern terms, the &quot;zero grade&quot;), but more reduced than the &quot;&quot; vowels (in modern terms, the &quot;lengthened grade&quot;). As an example, &quot;ṛ, i, u&quot; are basic (zero-grade) vowels, with corresponding (full-grade) vowels &quot;ar, e, o&quot; and (lengthened-grade) vowels &quot;ār, ai, au&quot;. (This is more understandable once it is realized that, at an earlier stage of development, Sanskrit &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; were &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot;, and Sanskrit &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot; were &quot;āi&quot; and &quot;āu&quot;.) &quot;Guṇa&quot; corresponds to what is now termed the &quot;full grade&quot; in Indo-European ablaut. Another orthography and phonology concept related to &quot;Guṇa&quot; is &quot;Vṛddhi&quot;. These innovations are not unique to Sanskrit, but also found in Greek, Latin, Italian and to some extent Russian. &quot;Guna&quot; and other rules of language for Sanskrit are described by Pāṇini in his &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;.

=== Ayurveda ===
In the terminology of Ayurveda (traditional medicine), &quot;guṇa&quot; can refer to one of twenty fundamental properties which any substance can exhibit, arranged in ten pairs of antonyms, viz. heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, viscous/liquid.

Guṇa is also a concept in Ayurvedic medicine, as a system to assess conditions and diets. For this reason Triguṇa and tridosha are considered to be related in the traditions of Ayurveda.

<doc id="799790" wikidata="Q2333813" url="?curid=799790" title="Dead or Alive 3">
<text>is a 2001 fighting game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo for the Xbox console as one of its launch titles. It is the third main entry in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting series following &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; (1999). &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; improved upon the gameplay and graphics in beautiful detail compared to that of its predecessors.

The game&#x27;s story focuses on DOATEC&#x27;s attempt to create the ultimate human weapon through their Omega Project by capturing and transforming the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan&#x27;s Hajin Mon leader, Genra, into an evil superhuman called Omega. The ninjas enter the third Dead or Alive tournament to defeat Omega.

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was critically acclaimed and a commercial success upon release, selling over 1 million units in the first five months after its release, and went on to sell over 2 million units worldwide, becoming the best selling game in the franchise and one of the top 10 best selling Xbox games. The game won several awards and was nominated for many others. The European and Japanese versions were released months later, featuring additional content and gameplay updates that are not featured in the North American version. 

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; later became backwards compatible on Xbox 360. In 2021, all versions of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; were made available to download from Xbox Live worldwide, and were later made backward compatible on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was followed by &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot; in 2004 and then its sequel &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; in 2005.

==Gameplay==

The basic gameplay controls remain essentially unchanged from &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;. Some tweaks have been added to the game system in the form of increased counter periods, unrestricted 3D-axis movement, and less emphasis on juggling combos. All these gameplay enhancements make the game suitable for beginners, and makes the artificial intelligence a bit more forgiving. Move properties for character attacks are updated. The game incorporated less damage percentiles in counter hold maneuvers, making players rely more on blows and throws to defeat opponents. Fighters who are caught in hazardous falls can now be knocked out if they have very low health.

The game adds a new feature in its Sparring mode called &quot;Exercise&quot;, an automatic command tutorial that teaches players how to perform attacks. One Command is displayed onscreen at a time during gameplay and changes after being successfully performed, therefore players can easily practice learning character moves while commands are displayed at the same time.

The Tag team system, introduced in the previous game, was also updated. Tag Battle matches are made available to select in the game&#x27;s Time Attack and Survival modes. A new mechanic called &quot;Attack Change&quot; was added, allowing the character tagging in to attack while switching in. The Tag Throws command was made a bit easier to activate.

Compared to previous entries in the series, the game takes advantage of the Xbox system&#x27;s power to push the range of the graphics and environment sizes farther than the &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; games. The game has less unlockable content compared to &quot;DOA2: Hardcore&quot;. The game also utilizes the Xbox controller&#x27;s pressure sensitive analog face buttons to allow shortcuts in performing certain moves, making the controls lenient to allow players new to the series to adapt to gameplay, players have the option to turn the analog buttons on or off.

=== European and Japanese versions ===
Months after the initial North American release of the game, the European and Japanese versions featured many gameplay changes, with more than a dozen new attacks for characters, an improved and more challenging artificial intelligence, tweaked move properties for attacks, more unlockable content, much better sidestepping movements that allows players to dodge most attacks, and the controller&#x27;s analog sticks can be used when the analog button setting is turned off.

==Characters==

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; features a total of 18 fighters, including 17 playable characters and the boss character Omega. The characters returning from the previous installments are Ayane, Bass Armstrong, Bayman, Ein (unlockable), Gen Fu, Helena Douglas, Jann Lee, Kasumi, Leifang, Leon, Ryu Hayabusa, Tina Armstrong, and Zack. Playable newcomers are Chinese drunken fighter Brad Wong, British assassin Christie, Japanese ninja Hayate (appeared in the roster of the previous title as &quot;Ein&quot;), and German-Japanese karateka Hitomi.

===New===
*Brad Wong, a Chinese drunken fighter whose teacher, Chen, sends him on a journey to search for the mysterious wine called &quot;Genra&quot;. After three years of wandering, he finds himself in the Dead or Alive tournament.
*Christie, a British assassin and she-quan practitioner hired by Victor Donovan, leader of DOATEC&#x27;s anti-Douglas faction. She enters the tournament in order to keep an eye on Helena.
*Hayate, a Japanese ninja and the 18th leader of the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan, who appeared in the previous game as &quot;Ein&quot;. He enters the tournament again in order to defeat Genra, the superhuman created as a puppet of DOATEC&#x27;s Project Omega.
*Hitomi, a German-Japanese karateka who always wanted to fight in the Dead or Alive tournament. After getting permission from her father, she joins the tournament in order to test her formidable skills against the real world.
*Omega , the evil superhuman of DOATEC&#x27;s Project Omega who used to be Genra, the leader of the Mugen Tenshin&#x27;s Hajin Mon sect and Ayane&#x27;s foster-father.

==Plot==
The hero ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, put a stop to the evil doings of Tengu during the last tournament, but it was too late to stop him from triggering a massive worldwide collapse. A dense cloud covered the entire planet in a shroud of darkness and fear. DOATEC has gone astray, turning into the hunting grounds for power-hungry scam artists.

This is when DOATEC&#x27;s development department (a fortress for state-of-the-art military technology) witnesses the success of a genius. Following Project Alpha and Project Epsilon, the ever ambitious scientist, Dr. Victor Donovan completes the Omega Project, producing a new superhuman: Genra. The man, who was once leader of the Hajin Mon ninjas of the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan, is no longer human, but a force of singular and unprecedented capabilities known as Omega. To test the subject Omega&#x27;s skills, DOATEC announced the third Dead or Alive World Combat Championship.

The ninjas Hayate, Ayane, and Ryu Hayabusa enter the third tournament to defeat Genra. Bayman, the assassin who was once hired by Victor Donovan to kill Fame Douglas during the first tournament, enters the third tournament to get revenge on Donovan after he sent a mysterious sniper to kill him. Bayman easily quashed the sniper, but the feeble attempt on his life left Bayman in anger and in retaliation against Donovan. Helena Douglas, daughter of Fame Douglas was captured by the anti-Douglas faction of DOATEC led by Donovan. Whether Helena likes it or not, she is dragged into the intertwined conspiracies within the huge DOATEC organization. Donovan challenges Helena to win the third tournament. If she wins, she will regain her freedom and learn the truth behind DOATEC. To prevent Helena from winning, Donovan hires a British assassin named Christie to keep an eye on her, and kill her if necessary.

As the tournament is underway, Kasumi, who is hunted and forced to defend herself from multiple attempts on her life by highly skilled ninja assassins, due to her status as a runaway ninja, desires to see her brother Hayate again. She cross paths with her half-sister Ayane, who states that she can see Hayate if she wants as she&#x27;s more focused on defeating Genra rather than hunting her. Kasumi meets with Hayate, who&#x27;s torn between the ninja code and his love for his sister. He decides to save Kasumi by pretending he didn&#x27;t meet with her. Afterwards, an argument is made between the ninjas on who should defeat Genra. Hayabusa is prepared to bring down Genra, but Hayate states to Hayabusa that he does not know Genra like he does since he and Genra are from the same clan. Hayate also states that since he is the new leader of the Mugen Tenshin, he should defeat Genra instead. Later, both Ayane and Hayate argue on who should defeat Genra. Ayane, as a Hajin Mon ninja and Genra&#x27;s foster-daughter, feels that fate commands her to put Genra out of his misery and that it is her duty to defeat him. Eventually, Hajin Mon&#x27;s Ayane wins the third Dead or Alive tournament and kills Genra. Saddened by his death, Ayane cremates his body and keeps his tokkosho sword. 

==Development and release==
After the success of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot;, Tecmo was working on continuing the series when Microsoft approached them, offering a deal to develop the next &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; as an exclusive title for the recently announced Xbox. The Xbox was still in development, and Microsoft was in need of exclusive, high-profile games to show off the technical capability of their product. This deal also fit in with series creator Tomonobu Itagaki&#x27;s design philosophy of always targeting the most powerful console available for the development of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; games. Itagaki accepted the offer as he noted how the specs of Xbox were much higher and more powerful than other systems such as the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast. Itagaki and Team Ninja noted how developing solely for one home console was easier and how the Xbox&#x27;s development environment was as convenient as the Dreamcast&#x27;s, and was much more convenient than the PlayStation 2&#x27;s. 

In 2001, the release of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was announced in Japan, but the game was first released in the US, in order to coincide with the American Xbox launch. An updated version of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was then released for the Japanese and European Xbox launches several months later.

The European and Japanese versions of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; feature more content such as extra costumes, new attacks for characters, gameplay tweaks, and a new cinematic introduction for the game. Because of its early release, the North American version does not feature any of the above. In January 2002, Microsoft released the &quot;Xbox Exhibition Volume 1 disc&quot; containing booster content for &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, and in May 2002, &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; provided a &#x27;Booster Disc&#x27; for &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;. Both releases included the new cinematic introduction and all of the extra costumes released on the EU and JP versions of the game, but they did not however contain the extra fighting moves or general game balancing tweaks that the other versions brought. Both releases also contained a playable demo for those who didn&#x27;t have the game. Only Time Attack mode is playable in the demo and only Hitomi, Zack, Tina, Bass, Jann Lee, Leifang, Christie, and Helena are playable while the other game modes, characters, and game settings are locked down. The booster content continued to be provided with the &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; demo disc from June 2002 to September 2002; each disc featured the same content but gave magazine buyers multiple times to acquire it.

In addition to the original soundtrack in the game, three songs by the American rock band, Aerosmith, also appear in &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; and can also be played in the game&#x27;s settings menu. &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was the opening theme, and &quot;Home Tonight&quot; was played over the credits. &quot;Amazing&quot; was not used in the actual game, but was a music sample under the settings menu.

The Platinum Hits, Platinum Collection, and Xbox Classics editions of the game were released in 2003.

===Merchandise===
An Arcade Stick for &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; made by Japanese video game peripheral manufacturer, Hori, was released exclusively for the Xbox on February 22, 2002, in order to coincide with the &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; and Xbox launch in Japan.

A soundtrack CD for the game, titled &quot;Dead or Alive 3 Original Sound Trax&quot; (KWCD-1006), was released by Wake Up in 2002. A guide book titled &quot;Dead or Alive 3: Prima&#x27;s Official Strategy Guide&quot; by Prima Games was published in North America on November 5, 2001. Three more guide books were published in Japan in early 2002: &quot;Dead or Alive 3 Guide Book&quot; (デッド オア アライブ3 ガイドブック) by &quot;Famitsu&quot; / Enterbrain, &quot;Dead or Alive 3 Kōshiki Kōryaku Guide&quot; (デッド オア アライブ3 公式攻略ガイド) by Kodansha, and &quot;Dead or Alive 3 Perfect Guide&quot; (デッド オア アライブ3 パーフェクトガイド) by SoftBank.

=== Backwards compatibility and re-release ===
&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; later became backwards compatible on the Xbox 360. On November 10, 2021, &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; became available to download on Xbox Live worldwide. As of November 15, 2021, &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; is now backward compatible on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.
The European and Japanese versions of &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, both which feature more content, can be downloaded from Xbox Live on American Xbox platforms by purchasing the game in the Xbox Store first, then changing the region in the Xbox settings to either United Kingdom or Japan, and restarting the console before downloading. The console can be switched back to the American region after the download is complete.

==Reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was &quot;critically acclaimed&quot;, receiving generally favorable reviews, scoring 86.19% and 87/100, according to the review aggregation websites GameRankings and Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a high score of 37 out of 40.

Anthony Chau of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; a 9.4 out of 10, stating that it &quot;represents the new standard of excellence that only the Xbox can deliver&quot;, praising the game for its great attention to detail and its vast improvements on its predecessor. Chau also stated how Team Ninja &quot;didn&#x27;t stop setting standards in just the graphics as they combined this level of visual quality with subtle but innovative 3D gameplay mechanics incorporating a new standard of strategy never experienced in a 3D fighting game before&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin also praised the graphics, saying the game &quot;looks absolutely stunning&quot; and was the &quot;best-looking home fighting game ever released&quot;, but opined that &quot;once you get past its graphics, you&#x27;ll find that &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; doesn&#x27;t offer much of anything that hasn&#x27;t been done in other 3D fighting games&quot;. The staff of 1Up.com agreed with this sentiment saying: &quot;There is very little here that we would describe as new, original or subtle; where &quot;Soul Calibur&quot; painted a fighting masterpiece, &quot;DOA3&quot; portrays something more akin to the latest Bruckheimer production. Check it out, but expect a few pangs of disappointment&quot;. &quot;NextGen&quot; disagreed with &quot;Gamespot&quot; and &quot;1Up.com&quot; and gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, stating that the game was &quot;Quite possibly the best 3D fighting game ever made, both in graphics and gameplay&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s deep, and it&#x27;s so beautiful it almost hurts&quot;. &quot;ActionTrip&quot; rated it 94 out of 100, stating how &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; truly excels in its variety of fighting styles and different moves and that &quot;any self-respecting beat-em-up fan should own this game&quot;. John Valor of &quot;Cloudchaser&quot; praised &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;″s full utilization of the Xbox controller with such ease, calling it &quot;an incredible achievement&quot;. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; called &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; &quot;The true King of Fighters&quot;, and &quot;a perfect showcase for what kind of games the Xbox is able to deliver&quot;. Justin Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot; called it &quot;a masterpiece in both form and function&quot;. &quot;GameShark&quot; stated &quot;Is &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; a great game? Yes. Is it the best fighter ever? No, but hey, it&#x27;s light years better than &quot;Tekken Tag&quot; and a hell of a lot more fun than &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s N&#x27;Gai Croal called &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; the future of fighting games. &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; gave the game a 9.5 out of 10, calling it a &quot;Glorious looking, fast moving fighter with all the right moves&quot; and &quot;The most technologically advanced fighting game ever made&quot;.

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; was awarded &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences; it was also a nominee for the &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Animation&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;&quot;. The game was also awarded &quot;Outstanding Fighting Game Sequel&quot; and nominated for &quot;Outstanding Animation in a Game Engine&quot; by the inaugural National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR).

The game won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Graphics, Technical&quot; prize among console games, but also received a nomination in the &quot;Most Disappointing Game&quot; category, and was a runner-up for the &quot;Best Xbox Game&quot; category. The game was also nominated for &quot;Xbox Game of the Year&quot; at the Golden Joystick Awards.

===Sales===
&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; became the best-selling installment in the series. In 2002, Tecmo announced the game had reached sales of over 1 million units worldwide in the first five months after its release. The game topped the Japanese charts on release, coming in number 1 during Week 8 in 2002. The game sold over 1.5 million units by early 2003, and went on to sell over 2 million units worldwide. By July 2006, it had sold 950,000 units and earned $36 million in the U.S. alone. &quot;NextGen&quot; ranked it as the 59th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; fighting games released in the 2000s reached 1.3 million units in the U.S. by July 2006. The game became the third best-selling launch title next to Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; and the first third-party Xbox game to garner Platinum status.

==Legacy==

&quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; is notable for being one of the titles that were quintessential in helping build the Xbox brand. It demonstrated how powerful the Xbox was, what the platform was capable of delivering, and was the first fighting game for the platform. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; included it among the Xbox games &quot;that shaped the generation&quot;, and later included it in their list of the &quot;best original Xbox games&quot;. 

In 2002, &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; became the first fighting game to receive an award from the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) during the academy&#x27;s inaugural award show, and the first fighting game to be included in the Xbox Championship tournaments. &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;&#x27;s popularity led to the creation of the largest and oldest &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; community website, &quot;Free Step Dodge&quot;, while the sidestepping mechanic in the &quot;European and Japanese versions&quot; of the game inspired the naming of the community site. 

In 2004, &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Hilary Goldstein declared &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; as the best Xbox Platinum Hit. In 2008, &quot;CinemaBlend&quot; ranked the game as the 8th best fighting game of all time. In 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the game as the 15th best fighting game of all time. In 2016, &quot;Twinfinite&quot; ranked it 11th best fighting game of all time. In 2022, &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked it the &quot;Best Xbox Fighting Game To Hold Up Well&quot;.

<text>Sidónio Bernardino Cardoso da Silva Pais (; 1 May 1872 – 14 December 1918) was a Portuguese politician, military officer, and diplomat, who served as the fourth president of the First Portuguese Republic in 1918. One of the most divisive figures in modern Portuguese history, he was referred to by the writer Fernando Pessoa as the &quot;President-King&quot;, a description that stuck in later years and symbolizes his regime.

==Early life==

Pais was born in Caminha, 1 May 1872, the eldest child of Sidónio Alberto Marrocos Pais, a notary of Jewish descent, and Rita Júlia Cardoso da Silva, both natives of Caminha.

He completed his primary education in Sertã, where he lived between the ages of 7 and 11, and completed his secondary education at the Lyceum of Viana do Castelo (Santa Maria Maior High School), after which he went to Coimbra in order to take preparatory courses in mathematics and philosophy. In 1888, he decided upon a military career and entered the Army School, attending artillery courses. An outstanding student, he completed his courses with distinction, and was promoted to sub-lieutenant (&quot;alferes&quot;) in 1892, lieutenant in 1895, captain in 1906 and major in 1916.

Upon completion of his courses at the Army School, Pais enrolled at the University of Coimbra, where he graduated in mathematics. He received his doctorate at the same university in 1898.

==Politics==

Already during his time in Coimbra, in the waning years of the Portuguese Monarchy, Pais had given vent to his republican ideals. During this period he also belonged for a short period to a masonic lodge in Coimbra, although he does not appear to have been very active.

By now considered to be a distinguished mathematician, he remained in Coimbra, where he was appointed professor at the Faculty of Differential and Integral Calculus. He also worked as a professor at the Brotero Industrial School, where he was also a director from 1905 to 1909. On 23 October 1910 he was appointed vice-chancellor of the university, under Rector Manuel de Arriaga.

As a leading Republican, Pais was catapulted into active political life after the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic in 1910. After a brief membership of the managing board of the national railway company, he was elected as a deputy of the National Constituent Assembly that was charged with drafting the Portuguese Constitution of 1911. As a leading member of the Constituent Assembly, Pais was appointed Minister of Public Works in the government chaired by João Chagas, assuming his office on 24 August 1911. In this post, which he held until 3 November 1911, he represented the government during the festivities that marked the first anniversary of the Republic in the city of Porto.

After the fall of the Chagas government, he kept his place in government by taking up the post of Finance Minister in Augusto de Vasconcelos&#x27; &quot;Government of concentration&quot;. Taking office on 7 November 1911, he held on to this position until 16 June 1912.

At a moment when international tensions that would lead to World War I already made themselves felt, Pais was appointed to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary (ambassador) of Portugal in Berlin on 17 August 1912. He remained in that important diplomatic post during the critical period that led to the outbreak of the war, maintaining a difficult balance between the pressures of the Portuguese Government, with increasingly pro-war and Anglophile viewpoints, attempts to settle diplomatically border conflicts in areas of contact between the Portuguese and German colonies in Africa, and his own increasingly Germanophile position. Despite these difficulties, he held the position until 9 March 1916, the date on which Germany declared war on Portugal following the seizure of German ships in ports under Portuguese control.

==Government and presidency==
Back in Portugal, he formed a natural rallying point for those who opposed Portugal&#x27;s participation in the war, catalyzing the growing discontent caused by both the effects of the war effort at home and the poor results obtained by the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps at the front. He became the main leader of opposition to Afonso Costa&#x27;s Democratic Party government, and from 5 to 8 December 1917, he led an insurrection by around 250 troops. The coup ended victoriously after three days of heavy confrontations, in which the role of civil groups was decisive for the insurgents&#x27; success. On the morning of 8 December Costa handed over power to Pais&#x27; military junta.

Instead of starting the usual consultation for the formation of a new government, the rebels took power, removing Bernardino Machado from the post of President of the Republic and forcing his exile. Subsequently, on 11 December 1917, Sidónio Pais took over as President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister), and in addition accumulated the portfolios of War Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also took over (on 27 December) the functions of President until a new election could be organized early in the new year. All of these actions were in direct violation of the Constitution of 1911, which he himself had helped to draft. During the coup and the early stages of his government, Sidónio Pais enjoyed the support of various labor groups, in exchange for the release of imprisoned comrades, and because of expectations inside the influential National Workers&#x27; Union, which looked to position itself as a centre of power of the republican left.

Subsequently, Pais issued a set of dictatorial decrees, without consulting the Congress of the Republic, and suspended important parts of the Constitution, giving the regime a markedly presidential image. The President of the Republic in effect became Head of State and leader of the Government, which, significantly, was entirely composed of state secretaries instead of (higher-ranked) ministers. In this new political architecture, which his supporters called a &quot;New Republic&quot;, the Head of State was placed in a position of power that had known no parallel in Portuguese history since the end of absolutism. Hence, Pessoa&#x27;s epithet of a &quot;President-King&quot; was well-deserved. In its objectives and in many of its forms, the New Republic was a precursor of the Estado Novo of António de Oliveira Salazar.

In an attempt to normalize relations with the Roman Catholic Church Sidónio Pais amended the Law of Separation of Church and State on 23 February 1918. This prompted an immediate, fierce reaction from traditional Republicans and Freemasons, but garnered widespread support from Catholics, moderate Republicans, and the rural population, then the vast majority of the Portuguese population. This decision also re-established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, which appointed Monsignor Benedetto Aloisi Masella (later to be nuncio in Brazil, cardinal, and camerlengo) as apostolic nuncio in Lisbon on 25 July 1918.

In another unconstitutional move, Pais on 11 March 1918 decreed the direct election of the President by plebiscite, through universal suffrage. Making use of his popularity among Catholics, he was elected on 28 April 1918, obtaining 470,831 votes, an unprecedented number. He was proclaimed President of the Republic on 9 May of the same year, without even bothering to consult Congress, and enjoying direct democratic legitimacy, which he used – unsuccessfully – to crush opposition attempts.

The decrees of February and March 1918, which because their profound contradiction with the current constitution were labeled the &quot;Constitution of 1918&quot;, profoundly altered the Portuguese Constitution of 1911 and lent the regime a clear presidential character, revamped electoral law, and changed the laws on the separation of Church and State and the very distribution of power among the organs of state.

However, in April 1918, the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was slaughtered at the Battle of the Lys, and the Portuguese government was unable to bring in necessary reinforcements or even maintain a regular supply of troops. The situation reached such an extreme that, even after the end of the war, Portugal was unable to transport its troops back to the country. Social conflict had increased to the point of creating a permanent state of insurrection.

This situation marked the end of the regime&#x27;s charmed existence. Between alternating strikes, conflicts, and conspiracies, from the summer of 1918 onwards attempts to end the &quot;Sidonist&quot; regime escalated in severity and violence, which led the President to declare a state of emergency on 13 October 1918. With that act, and the harsh repression of opposing movements, he was able to regain momentary control of the political situation, but his regime was clearly mortally wounded.

As the year came to an end, the political situation did not improve, despite the end of fighting with the Armistice of 11 November 1918, an event accompanied by an affectionate message from King George V of the United Kingdom, who attempted to play down Sidónio Pais&#x27; previous, and well-known, pro-German attitudes.

==Assassination==

Pais escaped a first assassination attempt on 5 December 1918, during the award ceremony for survivors of the navy trawler &quot;Augusto de Castilho&quot;. Nine days later, however, he fell victim to the second.

The president made his way to the Rossio railway station in Lisbon on the evening of 14 December 1918, after having enjoyed dinner at the restaurant Silva, located in the Chiado. He was accompanied by his brother and his son, planning to take the train to Porto in order to confer with the Northern Military Juntas. When he entered the station at around 11 PM, he was received by a Republican Guard ordered to protect the President. The earlier, failed assassination attempt on the President had led to an increase in security. However, this couldn&#x27;t ruin the mood as a band played a popular song when the President entered the station.

Inside the station, the left-wing activist José Júlio da Costa was waiting for him, concealing a pistol in his Alentejo cloak. When the President passed the assassin on the first floor of Rossio station, Da Costa penetrated the double police cordon that surrounded the President and fired two shots from the pistol hidden under his cloak. The first shot hit Pais in the right arm, where the bullet became lodged. The second shot hit the President in the stomach, causing a wound which would prove fatal. Pais immediately fell to the ground, and a panic broke out. During the confusion, four innocent bystanders were fatally wounded by the guards; the assassin, who didn&#x27;t try to escape, was arrested after being brutally beaten by the crowd. Pais was still alive at this point and was rushed toward St. Joseph Hospital, but he died of his wounds en route to the hospital shortly before midnight.

Sidónio Pais&#x27;s funeral was attended by tens of thousands of people, but multiple interruptions, some of them violent, took place as protesters mingled among the crowd. On 16 December, João do Canto e Castro was chosen as his successor by the Congress of the Republic rather than through a new plebiscite.

==Legacy==

The murder of Sidónio Pais heralded a traumatic time for the First Republic. Essentially a populist, charismatic leader, Pais portrayed himself as the last hope of a doomed country, and was widely perceived as such. This explains why his assassination had such a huge, and long-lasting influence on Portuguese politics. From then on, most political stability disappeared, leading to a permanent crisis that only ended nearly eight years later when the 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état set up the ensuing forty years of dictatorship.

Douglas Wheeler tries to explain Pais&#x27; attractiveness as a leader (and later, a cult figure) by pointing to his character:

The writer Fernando Pessoa admiringly referred to Pais as the &quot;President-King&quot; (&quot;Presidente-Rei&quot;), a description that stuck in later years because it adequately symbolized his regime. Particularly among the most conservative Catholic groups, Pais entered the Portuguese imagination as a mix of a savior and a martyr, and caused the emergence of a popular cult, similar to the one existing around the figure of José Tomás de Sousa Martins, which endures until today. It is common to see fresh flowers and religious symbols being laid at his tomb. This is mainly due to his reversal of some early republican anti-clerical laws. But it seems somewhat ironic that his name lives on most vividly in these circles since Pais was not a particularly religious man himself.

Pais must carry some of the responsibility for subsequent dictatorships because of his autocratic style of government and the removal of any remaining checks on the regime. The ineffectuality of his regime failed to bring the order it had promised and only contributed to the chaos of the First Republic and the undermining of its legitimacy.

The Estado Novo regime that controlled Portugal during much of the 20th century exploited the legacy and associations of &quot;Sidonism&quot; to its advantage. For instance, when the Portuguese National Pantheon was inaugurated in 1966, the authorities had Pais&#x27;s body transferred to it from the Room of the Chapter of the Jeronimos Monastery, where it had been interred previously.

==Family and descendants==

Pais married Maria dos Prazeres Martins Bessa (Amarante, São Gonçalo, 1868/1869 – Porto?/Lisbon, 1945) in 1895. The couple had five children, four sons and one daughter. Out of wedlock, he also had one daughter by one Ema Manso Preto. He was the great-grandfather in the male line of pianist and composer Bernardo Sassetti (1970–2012).

==Museum plans==

In 2002, Caminha&#x27;s &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot; purchased the ruin of Pais&#x27; birthplace for 175,000 Euros. The architect Nuno Brandão Costa was asked in 2009 to turn the house into a museum. The basement should house a room dedicated to Pais&#x27;s presidency, with a second hall devoted to his life on the ground floor. The first floor will be turned into a documentation center. The costs of the conversion are estimated to be one million Euros. There appears to have been made little to no progress after the mid-2010s, however.

<text>Johannes VI Ambundii, Archbishopric of Riga 1418-1424, secular name Johannes Ambundii de Swan, also Abundi, Ambundij, Habundi, Habendi, Habindi, Almanni and ~ von Schwan (born 1384; died 16 June 1424) was a German ecclesiastic. Ambundii is thought to be born in the area of Stettin (Szczecin) in Pomerania. He studied at the Juristical University of Prague, and graduated in 1391. Later, he got his doctor in theology and canonical law.

==Career==
From 1394–1399 he was general vicar of the bishop of Bamberg. In 1401, he was general vicar in Speyer, and in 1408 general vicar in Würzburg.

In 1412, he visited the Scottish convent of St. Ägidius in Nuremberg, by order of the bishop of Bamberg. He was canon of the church of Eichstädt and provost of Herriden in 1414 or 1415 and as such took part at the Council of Constance. On 27 November 1416 he was elected bishop of Chur and affirmed by the archbishop of Mainz, Johann II. Shortly afterwards, Ambundii returned to the council.

At this time, Italy, France and Spain demanded the immediate election of the pope, while the Holy Roman Empire preferred to first initiate the reform of the Church. Ambundii convinced Emperor Sigismund to give priority to the election.

On 11 July 1418 Pope Martin V &quot;by recommendation of the Emperor&quot; nominated Johannes Ambundii to the position of Archbishopric of Riga where he stayed until 1424. In Riga Ambundii initiated the establishment of the Livonian Confederation.

On 13 October 1418 Ambundii participated in the negotiations between the State of the Teutonic Order and the Kingdom of Poland in Wileny.

Ambundii was unhappy with his new office in the far north. The German brothers from the order deemed him a bitter and scant man, &quot;which is not a laudable trait for great men&quot; as a chaplain said. It was seen with anxiety that Ambundii was a counselor of the Emperor and considered his favorite. The order tried to acquire Livonia as independent property from the Emperor and feared Ambundii would act in opposition to the efforts. In fact, it was caused by him that the chapter of Riga asked the pope to revoke the &quot;Bulle Bonifacii IX&quot;, which incorporated the Church of Riga to the order.

In 1421 he acted as papal delegated judge in a quarrel between the king of Sweden and the bishop of Uppsala. In 1422 he organized a council of the Prussian bishops, but it did not take place.

<text>Lithuania Minor (; ; ) or Prussian Lithuania (; ; ) is a historical ethnographic region of Prussia, where Prussian Lithuanians (or Lietuvininkai) lived, now located in Lithuania and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia. Lithuania Minor encompassed the northeastern part of the region and got its name from the territory&#x27;s substantial Lithuanian-speaking population. Prior to the invasion of the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century, the main part of the territory later known as Lithuania Minor was inhabited by the tribes of Skalvians and Nadruvians. The land depopulated during the incessant war between Lithuania and the Teutonic Order. The war ended with the Treaty of Melno and the land was repopulated by Lithuanian newcomers, returning refugees, and the remaining indigenous Baltic peoples; the term Lithuania Minor appeared for the first time between 1517 and 1526.

With the exception of the Klaipėda Region, which became a mandated territory of the League of Nations in 1920 by the Treaty of Versailles and was unified with Lithuania from 1923 to 1939, the area was part of Prussia until 1945, which at various times was under sovereignty of the Kingdom of Poland, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Germany. Since 1945, a small portion of Lithuania Minor has been retained within the borders of modern-day Lithuania and Poland while most of the territory is part of the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, which was part of the Soviet Union until December 1991.

Although hardly anything remains of the original culture due to the expulsion of Germans after World War II, Lithuania Minor has contributed significantly to Lithuanian culture overall. The standard written form of Prussian-Lithuanian provided the basis for modern Lithuanian, evolved from people close to Stanislovas Rapalionis and graduates from Lithuanian-language schools established in Vilnius, who were expelled from the Grand Duchy during Counter-Reformation years. Those include notable names like Abraomas Kulvietis and Martynas Mažvydas. During the years of the 19th-century Lithuanian press ban, most of the Lithuanian books printed using the Latin alphabet were published in Lithuania Minor.

==Terminology==

The term &quot;Lithuania Minor&quot; refers to the northernmost part of the former province of East Prussia (about ). It was first mentioned as in Simon Grunau&#x27;s Prussian Chronicle of the early 16th century (between 1517 and 1526) and was later repeated by another Prussian chronicler, Lucas David. The term Lithuania Minor was first applied during the 19th century and used more widely during the 20th century, mostly among historians and ethnographers.

The northeastern limit of the area of Prussia inhabited by Lithuanians was the state border between Lithuania and Prussia, and the northern border was along the Nemunas River, but the southwestern limit was not clear. Thus, the territory of Lithuania Minor has been understood differently by different parties; it could be:

* either the area limited in the south by Max Toeppen – Adalbert Bezzenberger&#x27;s line (about ) what is roughly the area of the former administrative Lithuania Province (about ), where the population was almost entirely Lithuanian until 1709–1711,
* or the area of the former region with actual Lithuanian majority or of considerable percentage (about 17–18,000 km2 or 6,500–7,000 sq mi).

The administrative terms &quot;Lithuanian province&quot; (), &quot;Lithuanian districts&quot; (), &quot;Lithuanian county&quot; () or simply &quot;Prussian Lithuania&quot; (), &quot;Lithuania&quot; () were used to refer to the Lithuanian inhabited administrative units (Nadruvia and Scalovia) in the legal documentation of Prussian state since 1618. The Lithuanian Province was named , , , &quot;Little Lithuania&quot;, &quot;Litvania&quot; in the maps of Prussia since 1738. The official use of the concepts Prussian Lithuania etc. decreased considerably from the administrative reform of 1815–1818.

==Geography==
The area of Lithuania Minor embraced the land between the lower reaches of the river Dangė to the north and the major headstreams of the river Pregolya () to the south. The southwestern line ran from the Curonian Lagoon along the Deimena River to its south, continued along the Prieglius River to the Łyna () river, up to the town of Alna (modern Druzhba) and hence southward along the Ašvinė river to Lake Ašvinis and from there eastward to the border of Lithuania Major. The region embraced about 11 400 km2. The broader understanding of Lithuania Minor includes the area west from the Łyna and south form the lower reaches of the Prieglius and the Sambian Peninsula, making up 17–18 thousand km2 in total.

The former ethnic region of Lithuania Minor belongs to different states today. The part of Kaliningrad Oblast (excluding the city of Kaliningrad and its surroundings), a few territories in Poland&#x27;s Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, as well as the following territories in modern-day Lithuania: the Klaipėda district municipality, the Šilutė district municipality, Klaipėda city, Pagėgiai municipality, and Neringa municipality had once ethnically, linguistically and culturally been the latter Lithuanian region. Although now divided among countries, Lithuania Minor had been intact formerly, all these areas were once part of Prussia and thus politically separated from Lithuania Major.

From 1773 to 1918, all of Lithuania Minor was part of the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s province of East Prussia, the core of medieval Prussia. It was a region outside of the former Lithuanian state, inhabited by a large number of Prussian Lithuanians. Ethnic Prussian Lithuanians were mostly Protestants, in contrast to the inhabitants of Lithuania Major, who predominantly were Roman Catholics.

Giving the Prussian Lithuanian name first and followed by the German name, major cities in former Lithuania Minor were Klaipėda (Memel) and Tilžė (Tilsit). Other towns include Ragainė (Ragnit), Šilokarčema (Heydekrug), renamed to Šilutė, Gumbinė (Gumbinnen), Įsrutis (Insterburg), Stalupėnai (Stallupönen).

==History==

===Pre-Lithuania Minor===
The territory, which was given the denomination Lithuania Minor in the 16th century, was not alien to Lithuanians ethnically as well as politically in earlier times. It had once been partly subject to Mindaugas&#x27; Lithuania in the 13th century. Later, captured (1275–76) and ruled by the Teutonic Knights, the land was reckoned, what is recorded in the historical sources, to be their patrimony by Algirdas (officially said) and Vytautas (recorded to be said unofficially).

====German-Lithuanian rivalry====

The territory of western Lithuania began to be threatened by the Livonian order from the north and Teutonic Knights from the south in the 13th century. The Orders were seizing the lands of Baltic tribes, one of which – Lithuanians – had its state and was also expanding its power among neighbouring Baltic and Ruthenian people. The Order was granted the right over the pagan lands by popes and emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. It was conqueror&#x27;s right – awarded them as much lands as they would conquer. After the Battle of Saule the Livonian order was crushed and incorporated to the Teutonic Order as part of it. Mindaugas, in critical political circumstances for his rule, undertook to grant Samogitia to the Order in exchange for baptism and the crown from the pope. After Mindaugas became a king, a direct subject of the Pope, in 1253, the acts of grants of the lands for Livonian Order were written:
*1253 July, the act granting Nadruvia and Karšuva to the Order, written in Lithuanian curia by Mindaugas.
*1259 the act granting Dainava and Scalovia to the Order, written by Mindaugas. In the historiography this act is considered to be falsified by the Order.
All Baltic tribes rose against the Order after the Battle of Durbe (1260). Mindaugas officially canceled his relations with the Livonian Order in 1261 and the acts of grants became invalid. Mindaugas&#x27;s royal dynasty discontinued when he and two sons were assassinated in 1263. Lithuanian dukes did not join the Prussians in their uprising due to inside instability of the Lithuanian throne. Nadruvia and Scalovia (which comprised much of later Lithuania Minor) had been taken by the Teutonic Knights in 1275–1276 after the Prussian uprising and they reached Neman from the south in 1282. Lithuania also did not manage to retain Semigallian castles lying north from Lithuania and the Semigallians fell under the Order finally during Gediminas&#x27;s rule. Samogitians, whose land lay between the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Order, had been many times granted to the Order juridically by Lithuanian dukes, popes, emperors of Holy Roman Empire, but either the Order did not managed to take it, or the Lithuanian dukes departed from their treaty and grant. Klaipėda was passed to Teutonic Order from its Livonian branch in 1328.

The patrimony for Nadruvia and Scalovia was remembered by post-Mindaugas grand dukes of Lithuania: Algirdas, during the negotiation on Lithuania&#x27;s Christianization, postulated (1358) for the emperor of Holy Roman Empire, Charles IV, that he would accept Christianity when the Order was transferred to Russia&#x27;s border to fight Tatars and Lithuania would be given back the lands to Łyna, Pregolya rivers and Baltic sea. Lithuanian grand dukes probably considered the Order to be illegitimate state, propagandizing the mission of Christianization as the fundamental aim and factually seeking political authority at one time. Additionally, after the Order had become Protestant state, the conquered Baltic lands were not acknowledged as its possession by the popes.

After the Battle of Grunwald the dispute between Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Order on Samogitia started. Vytautas wanted the border to be the Neman River, while the Order wanted to have Veliuona and Klaipėda in the right side of the river. Both sides agreed to accept the prospective solution of Emperor Sigismund&#x27;s representative Benedict Makrai. He decided that the right side of Nemunas (Veliuona, Klaipėda) had to be left for Lithuania (1413). Makrai is known to have stated:


The Order did not accept the solution. Later Vytautas agreed the solution to be made by Emperor Sigismund. He acknowledged Samogitians for the Order (1420). Vytautas did not accept the solution. Polish and Lithuanian military, not capturing the castles, devastated Prussia then and the Treaty of Melno was made. Klaipėda was left for the Order. Since the Melno treaty the land later become Lithuania Minor had been officially separated from Lithuania. It became part of the state of the Teutonic Order. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the longest of all Polish-Teutonic wars, the region was a part of Poland (and thus the Polish–Lithuanian union) as a fief held by the Teutonic Knights.

===Emergence===

In 1525, per the Treaty of Kraków, the state of the Teutonic Order was secularized and transformed into Ducal Prussia, a vassal duchy of Poland within the Polish–Lithuanian union (soon elevated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), and the term of Lithuania Minor has appeared around that time (1517–26). Lithuania Minor was part of the duchy until 1701, the Kingdom of Prussia until 1871, Germany until 1920, and afterwards it was divided. The political border set by the Treaty of Melno had been the same since the treaty to 1923, when the Klaipėda region was incorporated into Lithuania. Polish secret resistance was active and smuggled weapons through the region to the Russian-controlled Augustów Governorate and Samogitia during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. Several local resistance members and smugglers were arrested by the Prussians. The &quot;Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland&quot; from 1892 named Tilsit as the capital of Lithuania Minor.

====Post-World War I====

Lithuania declared its independence from Russia in 1918 during World War I. Some Prussian Lithuanian activists signed the Act of Tilsit, demanding unification of Lithuania Minor and Lithuania Major into a single Lithuanian state, thus detaching the areas of East Prussia from Germany which were inhabited by Prussian Lithuanians. This claim was supported by the Lithuanian government. The part north of the Neman River up to Memel was separated from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles in 1920, and was called the Memel Territory. It was made a protectorate of the Entente States, in order to guarantee port rights to Lithuania and Poland. In January 1923, the Klaipėda Revolt took place and Klaipėda region was annexed to Lithuania in 1923 under violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The subsequent incorporation of the territory brought economic prosperity to Lithuania, with the region accounting for 30 percent of the country&#x27;s economy. However, the region&#x27;s economic significance declined after economic sanctions were imposed by Nazi Germany in 1933. Nazi Germany persecuted the Lithuanian population of the region. In 1938 a massive campaign of renaming of placenames was carried out in the German-held part of Lithuania Minor in attempt to erase traces of Lithuanian origin. In 1940, the last Lithuanian newspaper published in Tilsit was closed by the Nazis.

German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop delivered an ultimatum to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister on 20 March 1939, demanding the surrender of the Klaipėda region to German control. Ribbentrop vowed that if Klaipėda was not ceded to Germany peacefully, it &quot;will be taken by other means if necessary&quot;. Lithuania submitted to the ultimatum and, in exchange for the right to use the new harbour facilities as a Free Port, ceded the disputed region to Germany in the late evening of 22 March 1939. Reunion of the Memel Territory with Germany was met with joy by a majority of Prussian Lithuanians. It was Nazi Germany&#x27;s last territorial gain prior to World War II. The remainder of Lithuania came under occupation by the Soviet Union, then briefly became independent again in 1941 before being occupied entirely by Nazi Germany.

During World War II, the Germans operated the at present-day Gromovo (), as well as several prisoner-of-war camps for Allied POWs of various nationalities, incl. the Stalag 331 C/I-C and Stalag I-D camps for regular soldiers, the Stalag Luft VI camp and Dulag Luft transit camp for air force personnel, Oflags 52, 53, 60 for officers, and forced labour subcamps of Stalag I-A. Groups of Poles expelled from German-occupied Poland were deported by the Germans to forced labour in the region (in the vicinity of Klaipėda and Tilsit).

====Post-World War II====

At the end of the war, the local German and Lithuanian population of the former East Prussia either fled or was expelled to the western parts of Germany. The Soviet Union recaptured Lithuania in 1944 and the Memel region was incorporated into the newly formed Lithuanian SSR in 1945 while the remainder of Lithuania Minor was divided between Poland (small parts now forming the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship) and the Soviet Union (eastern part of the Kaliningrad Oblast).

After the death of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev offered the Kaliningrad Oblast to the Lithuanian SSR. Secretary Antanas Sniečkus refused this offer. In 2010, a secret document was found which indicated that in 1990, the Soviet leadership was prepared to negotiate the return of Kaliningrad to Germany against payment. The proposal was declined by German diplomats. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Kaliningrad Oblast has become an exclave of Russia. Lithuania, Germany, and Poland lay no official claims to the region at this time.

Gołdap (), the seat of Gołdap County, a transitional county between Lithuania Minor and Masuria, is the largest municipality of the region within Poland, making it the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Polish Lithuania Minor, however, it is also considered part of Masuria and is not inhabited by an autochthonous Lithuanian population.

==Ethnic history==

===Descent of Lietuvininkai===

====Historiography====
Originally it was thought that Prussian Lithuanians were autochthones to Prussia. The base for it was A. Bezzenberger&#x27;s line of Prussian-Lithuanian language limit. The theory proposed that Nadruvians and Scalovians were western Lithuanians and the ancestors of Lietuvininks. It was prevalent until 1919.

The second theory proposed that the first Lithuanian inhabitants of the territory which later became Lithuania Minor appeared only after the war had ended. The theory was started by G. Mortensen in 1919. She stated, that Scalovians, Nadruvians and Sudovians were Prussians before the German invasion and Lithuanians were colonists of the 15–16th centuries from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania – Samogitia and Suvalkija. G. Mortensen created a conception of the wilderness, according to which the vicinities of both sides of the Neman up to Kaunas had become desolate in the 13–14th centuries. According to G. Mortensen&#x27;s husband H. Mortensen Lithuanian resettlement began in the last quarter of the 15th century. Lithuanian historian K. Jablonskis etc., archaeologist P. Kulikauskas etc. denied the idea of desolate land, uninhabited forests (Old German &quot;wildnis, wiltnis&quot;) and mass Lithuanian migration. The idea of Lithuanian immigration was accepted by Antanas Salys, Zenonas Ivinskis. J. Jurginis had studied the descriptions of the war roads into Lithuania and found where the word &quot;wildnis&quot; was used in the political sense. He deduced that wildnis was that part of Lithuania which belonged to the Order juridically, by the grants of the popes and emperors of Holy Roman Empire, but was not subordinate to it due to the resistance of the residents. The theory of desolate land was also criticized by Z. Zinkevičius, who has thought that old Baltic toponymy could be only preserved by the remaining local people.

H. Łowmiański thought that Nadruvian and Scalovian tribes had changed ethnically due to Lithuanian colonization as early as times of tribal social order. Linguist Z. Zinkevičius has presumed that Nadruvians and Skalovians were transitive tribes between Lithuanians and Prussians since much earlier times than German invasion had occurred.

====Background====
The German invasion and the war was the factor changing the former order of the Baltic area. While the German Order was expanding its territory, the holding of Lithuanian grand dukes was withdrawn in some places. The political situation during the war was influenced by the following factors:
*The situation of the war technologies. The Teutonic Order built many stone fortresses in the Baltic lands thus gaining the control over the ethnically foreign lands. Nadruvia was full of German castles.
*The geographical situation. The Neman became a kind of a front line between the Order and Lithuania during the several decades of the war after the German invasion. There were German castles up to Kaunas by Neman in the 14th century. Germans built their castles by the Lithuanian and vice versa. The wide forest stretched in the land by the left side of the middle reaches of the Neman, what was Sudovia or Suvalkija. It could originate as a wide border between Lithuanian and Sudovian tribes before pre-nation times of Lithuanians and also could expand due to the war. The land was sparse of German castles. The conquered Baltic lands were all called Prussia by the Teutonic Order but not all the lands with the German castles managed to build in them became occupied. The presence of the Neman river, also possibly the forests in Sudovia, Karšuva afforded the most economical variant for the defensive fortifications.
The war probably changed the situation of populations of the area:
*The demographic situation. The population of the territory which lain between the chief lands of Lithuanian state and Nadruvia – what was in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the northern half of Sudovia or Suvalkija – was sparse. Nadruvia possibly also became more depopulated than those Lithuanian lands which lay on the right side of the Neman during the war between the Teutonic Order, the Old Prussians, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
*The ethnical situation. The German invasion and the war between the latter state and Lithuanian one reduced, was expelling the local population to some extent and impelled some migrations of Baltic tribes. In the abstract, Nadruvia, Scalovia and Sudovia had to be inhabited by Nadruvians, Scalovians and Sudovians. All these three tribes are considered to have once been western Baltic, but the Lithuanian impact, close relations and immigration, is likely to be occurred before the German invasion.

====Prussian Lithuanian population====

The two main lands later became Lithuania Minor, Nadruvia and Scalovia, had Prussian ethnic substratum. Lithuanian elements prevailed in the toponymy of the territory, though. It is possible that Nadruvia and Skalovia had changed ethnically in the process of Lithuanian penetration to and consolidation of the Baltic lands in the pre-state times. The contacts between Nadruvian and Scalovian populations with those to the north and west, where the grand dukes of Lithuania were ruling from the 13th or the 12th century, were probably close. Nadruvia had bordered on Sudovia and Samogitia, Skalovia – on Samogitia and Nadruvia. The inside Baltic migration, trading and ethnic consolidation presumably had happened since the earlier times than the German military invasion occurred.

The land probably depopulated during the war and the source of the regeneration of the population was internal as well as presumably mainly external from neighbouring areas. The land was resettled by returning refugees and newcomers from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the permanent war had ended finally with the Treaty of Melno in 1422, the population continued to grow. The newcomers were Lithuanians from Trakai, Vilnius voideships and Samogitia. Lithuanian farmers used to flee to the Sudovian forest, which lain in the Trakai Voivodeship, and live here without dues, what was possible until the agrarian reform of Lithuania, performed during the second half of the 16th century.

The tribal areas such as Nadruvia, Scalovia, Sudovia had to some extent later coincided with the political administrative and the ethnic areas. Nadruvia and Scalovia became Lithuanian Province in Prussia and the Yotvingian population persisted in their lands more commonly as western Lithuanians in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Prussia.

As a distinctive ethno-cultural region, Lithuania Minor emerged during the 15th or the 16th century. The substratum of the Prussian Lithuanian population comprised mostly ethnic Baltic tribes – either local (Old Prussians – Sambians, north Bartians, Natangians; either probably formerly Lithuanized or Prussian Scalovians and Nadruvians; Sudovians, some Curonians) or from neighbouring areas (newcomers from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: Lithuanians from the right side of the middle reaches of the Neman or Suvalkija, Samogitians, Sudovians, Prussians etc.). Colonists from the Holy Roman Empire also contributed to the Lithuanian population to some extent. Prussians and Yotvingians tended to be assimilated by Lithuanians in Lithuania Minor.

Lithuanian percentage decreased to about half of population in about half of the area eastwards from Łyna river and northwards from the lower reaches of Pregolya during the 18th century. Lithuanian percentage of the area was continually decreasing during the ages since the plague of 1709–1711. In 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia prohibited Poles, Samogitians and Jews from settling in Lithuania Minor, and initiated German colonization to change the region&#x27;s ethnic composition. Lithuanians constituted the majority only in about half of the Memelland area and by Tilžė and Ragainė from the last quarter of the 19th century upwards to 1914. Lithuanian percentage was marginal in the southern half of the region of Lithuania Minor at that time. There resided about 170 thousands of Lietuvininks in East Prussia till 1914.

====Administration====
The territory known as the main part of Lithuania Minor had been distinguished in administrative terms first as Nadruvia and Scalovia, later the names &quot;Lithuanian counties&quot;, Lithuanian Province, Prussian Lithuania or &quot;Lithuania&quot; (&quot;Litauische Kreise&quot; or &quot;Litt(h) auen&quot;) became predominant. The administrative Lithuanian Province (part of the administrative province of Sambia) (about 10 000 km2) comprised four districts of that time: Klaipėda (Memel), Tilžė (Tilsit, Sovetsk), Ragainė (Raganita, Ragnit, Neman) and Įsrutis (Insterburg, Cerniachovsk).

====Reckoning====
The factual Prussian Lithuanian living area was broader than the administrative Lithuanian Province. Several Lithuanian-linked areas were determined on different criteria in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century by mostly German researchers (Lithuanians, without doing difference between the residents of Russian Empire and of Prussia, were considered by Germans in the 19th century to be the little nation facing its end. Therefore, the various researches on Lithuanian culture were made):
*Lithuanian inhabited area indicated by toponymic data. The language line between Old Prussian and Lithuanian languages was determined by A. Bezzenberger (linguistic, archaeological and geographical data) and M. Toeppen (historical data). A. Bezzenberger found that toponyms in the right side of Łyna and north from Pregolya after the Łyna fall were mostly Lithuanian (with &quot;-upē (upē&quot; – a river), &quot;-kiemiai, -kiemis, -kēmiai (kiemas&quot; – a village)) and in the left side – mostly Prussian (with &quot;-apē&quot; (&quot;apē&quot; – a river), -&quot;kaimis&quot; (&quot;kaimis&quot; – a village). Thus, the area (11 430 km²) was considered to be Lithuanian lived and its southern limit was roughly the same as the southern limit of Nadruvia administrative unit. Lithuania Minor is commonly understand to be this area.
*The area of traditional Lithuanian architecture: the original layout of the country seats, the architectural style. The territory between Königsberg, the lower reaches of Pregolya and Łyna river was architecturally mixed – of German-Lithuanian pattern. The latter area was inhabited by mostly Prussians and Lithuanians, later – Germans and Lithuanians. The Lithuanian Province together with the latter area and Sambia peninsula presents the broader perception of Lithuania Minor (about 18 000 km²).
*The area of the everyday vocabulary of Lithuanian country
*The area of churches where Lithuanian sermons were used in 1719. F. Tetzner on the ground of the list of villages where Lithuanian sermons were used in 1719 defined the southern limit of Lithuanian parishes. F. Tetzner wrote in the beginning of the 20th century: &quot;200 years ago the Lithuanian language area embraced, not mentioning the ten present districts of Prussia, also these: Koenigsberg, Žuvininkai, Vėluva, Girdava, Darkiemis and Gumbinė districts. Lithuanian sermons were finished in the last century in Muldžiai, Girdava district, also coastal villages around Žuvininkai and in the Koenigsberg district&quot;.

The limits of the latter Lithuanian areas were more southwest. Various other fragmentary demographic sources (the first general census was made in 1816) and the lists of colonists of the 18th century showed the area of Lithuanian majority and the areas of considerable percentage of Lithuanians to the first half of the 18th century. It was more southwest from the once existed administrative Lithuanian Province.

The southern limit of Lithuania Minor went by Šventapilis (Mamonovo), Prūsų Ylava (Preußisch Eylau, Bagrationovsk), Bartenstein (Bartoszyce), Barčiai (Dubrovka), Lapgarbis (Cholmogorovka), Mėrūniškai (Meruniszki), Dubeninkai (Dubeninki). The southern limit of the most compact Lithuanian area went by Žuvininkai, Königsberg, Frydland, Engelschtein (Węgielsztyn), Nordenburg (Krylovo), Węgorzewo, Gołdap, Gurniai, Dubeninkai.

===Ethnic composition===

The economic and especially demographic statistics had been fragmentary previous to the first general census of 1816. The accounting after the native tongue had begun since the census of 1825–1836.

Thus, the situation of ethnic composition previous to the century is known from the various separate sources: various records and inventories, descriptions and memoirs of contemporaries, language of the sermons used in the churches, registers of births and deaths; various state published documents: statutes, acts, decrees, prescriptions, declarations etc. The lists of peasants‘ pays for plots and grinding of flour was also demographic source. Lithuanian and German proportion of Piliakalnis (Dobrovolsk) in the middle of the 18th century was determined by O. Natau on the ground of these lists. The toponymy of Prussia and its changes is also a source for situation of Lithuanians.

The nationality of the residents of the country of Lithuania Minor is best shown by the sources from the fourth decade of the 18th century. In the process of the colonization of Lithuania Minor the order to check the circumstance of the state peasants was issued. The data showed the distribution by nationalities and the number of state peasants in the Lithuanian Province. The data was used by M. Beheim-Svarbach, who published the tabulations of the territorial distribution of Lithuanian and German villeins (having their farm) in all the villages and districts of Lithuanian Province. The data from the lists of colonists, which shown their descent, was published by G. Geking, G. Schmoler, A. Skalveit in their researches.

====Lietuvininkai====
The ethnic Lithuanian inhabitants of Lithuania Minor called themselves Lietuvininkai (other form Lietuvninkai). L. Baczko wrote around the end of the 18th century:

The historical sources indicate that Lietuvininkai is one of two historical ways to call all Lithuanians. Lietuvninkai (&quot;Литовники&quot;) are mentioned in the recording (1341) of the second chronicle of Pskov. In what had been the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the word &quot;lietuvis&quot; became more popular, while in Lithuania Minor &quot;lietuvininkas&quot; was preferred. Prussian Lithuanians also called their northern neighbors in Samogitia &quot;Russian Lithuanians&quot; and their south-eastern neighbors of the Suwałki region &quot;Polish Lithuanians&quot;. Some sources used the term Lietuvininkai to refer to any inhabitant of Lithuania Minor irrelevant of their ethnic adherence.

Lithuanian population presumably grew after the wars ended with the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Samogitian newcomers were more common in the northern part of it and Aukštaitian in the western one.

Lithuanians lived mostly in the rural areas. German towns were like islands in the Lithuanian Province. The area was overwhelmingly inhabited by Lithuanians until the plague of 1709–1711. Up to 300,000 people resided in the Lithuanian Province and the Labguva district prior to the plague, during which about 160,000 Lithuanians died in Lithuanian Province and Labguva district, which was 53 percent of the population of the latter area.

=====Ethnic situation during the 19th century=====
As a result of the plague of 1709–1711, German colonization and Germanisation policies, the ethnic composition of the region in the 19th centuries changed to the disadvantage of the Lithuanians and Poles and in favor of the Germans. According to Prussian data from 1837, ethnic Lithuanians still formed a sizeable portion of the population in the northern counties of the region, especially in rural areas, ranging from 33,9 percent in the Labiau/Labguva (Polessk) county to 74,4 percent in the Heydekrug (Šilutė) county. Also ethnic Polish, Curonian, Latvian and Jewish minorities lived in the region. The majority of Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants were Lutherans, not Roman Catholics like their ethnic kinsmen across the border in the Russian Empire.

In 1817, East Prussia had 796,204 Evangelical Christians, 120,123 Roman Catholics, 864 Mennonites and 2,389 Jews.

=====Pre-1914 and present-day situation=====
There were Lithuanian speakers and the Lithuanian language was effective throughout Lithuania Minor at the beginning of the 20th century, though the concentration places of Lithuanians were near Neman – Klaipėda, Tilžė (Tilsit), Ragainė (Ragnit). At the end of the war, the German and Lithuanian population of the former East Prussia either fled or was expelled to the western parts of Germany. There resided about 170,000 Prussian Lithuanians in East Prussia previous to 1914. Lithuanian fellowships functioned in Gumbinė, Įsrutis, Koenigsberg, Lithuanian press was printed in Geldapė, Darkiemis, Girdava, Stalupėnai, Eitkūnai, Gumbinė, Pilkalnis, Jurbarkas, Vėluva, Tepliava, Labguva, Koenigsberg, Žuvininkai.

No Germanization was performed in Lithuania Minor prior to 1873. Prussian Lithuanians were affected voluntarily by German culture. In the 20th century, a good number of Lithuanian speakers considered themselves to be Memellandish and also Germans. In 1914, Lithuanian representatives made their first steps to claim Minor Lithuania by signing the Amber Declaration, which called for the unification of ethnic Lithuanian lands. In the interbellum, after the division of Lithuania Minor between Germany and Lithuania, Lithuania started a campaign of Lithuanisation in its acquired region, the Klaipėda Region. In the regional census of 1925, more than 26 percent declared themselves Lithuanian and more than 24 percent simply as &quot;Memellandish&quot;, compared with more than 41 percent German. The election results to the Parliament of the Klaipėda Region (, ) between 1923 and 1939 revealed approximately 85 percent votes for German political parties and about 15 percent for national Lithuanian parties.
The former language of &quot;Lietuvninkai&quot; (which is very similar to standard Lithuanian) is currently spoken and known by only about several hundred people who were sometime residents of Lithuania Minor. Almost all former Prussian Lithuanians – including Lithuanian speakers – had already identified themselves with German speakers, or Prussians, by the end of the 19th century because of the influence of German culture and attitudes of the residents of East Prussia, which had been in quick progress during the 19th century. The majority of the Lietuvininkai population has migrated to Germany, together with Germans and now lives there.

Prussian Lithuanians spoke in western Aukštaitian dialect, those living by the Curonian lagoon spoke in the so-called &quot;Curonianating&quot; (Samogitian &quot;donininkai&quot; subdialect; there are three Samogitian dialects where Lithuanian &quot;duona&quot; (a bread) is said dūna, dona and douna) subdialect, and small part of them spoke in Dzūkian dialect. Prussian Lithuanians never called themselves and their own language Samogitian.

====Old Prussians====
Prussians were the native and main inhabitants of the lands which later became the core lands of the Teutonic Order. After conquest and conversion to Christianity, the Prussian nobility became vassals of the Order and Germanized. The officers of the Order ceased to speak in Prussian with local inhabitants in 1309. After the extinction of the Order and the spread of the Reformation of the church, the lot of Prussians became somewhat better. Three Reformed catechisms in the Prussian language were published between 1545 and 1561.

Prussian villagers tended to be assimilated as Lithuanians in the northern half of the Prussia region, and as Germans or Poles in the southern half. There were parts of Prussia where Lithuanians and ethnic Prussians made up the majority of inhabitants. Prussian Lithuanian and German populations were the minority until the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century in the Sambia peninsula. Later, Germans became the ethnic majority in the peninsula, while Lithuanians remained as a minority. The case of Jonas Bretkūnas illustrates the phenomenon of Prussian-Lithuanian bilingualism. The last Prussian speakers disappeared around the end of the 17th century.

====Germans====
The percentage of Germans in Lithuania Minor was low prior to 1709–1711. Later, Germans became the dominant ethnic group within Prussia. By 1945, when World War II was drawing to a close, the Soviets, who had occupied almost all of Eastern Europe, had effectively committed genocide of the local population, whether they were Prussian, Lithuanian, or German. During the winter, those who were physically fit walked across the frozen bays, while anyone who remained at home was eliminated.

====Poles====

The Darkehmen (, now Ozyorsk) and Gołdap counties, as transitional counties between Lithuania Minor and the Masuria region to the south, were inhabited by notable numbers of both Poles and Lithuanians, with Polish-founded villages including Kazachye (), Nekrasovo () and Maltsevo (). There were instances of Polish noble families living in the region, e.g. the Kręckis in Brasnicken and Metalskis in Mehlkehmen. From 1724, new Polish settlement in Lithuania Minor was banned by Frederick William I of Prussia. Despite this, according to Prussian data from 1825, Poles still lived in the more northern counties of the region, with the most numerous Polish populations located in the Tilsit (, now Sovetsk) and Stallupönen (, now Nesterov) counties. Following the unsuccessful November Uprising, Polish insurgents were interned in the region (notably in Tilsit and Insterburg (, now Chernyakhovsk)) in 1832. During the Polish January Uprising in the Russian Partition of Poland, there was a secret Polish organization in Insterburg (), which smuggled weapons for the insurgents. It was discovered by Prussian authorities in November 1864. A Polish consular post and consulate was based in Klaipėda in the interbellum, and once again from 2004.

During World War II, Poles formed the majority of the prisoners of the Hohenbruch concentration camp, Polish prisoners of war were among the prisoners of the Stalag I-C and Stalag Luft VI POW camps, and Polish civilians were also enslaved as forced labour in the region (in the vicinity of Klaipėda and Tilsit). The Polish resistance was active and operated one of the region&#x27;s main smuggling points for Polish underground press near Klaipėda, and a branch of the Peasant Battalions in Insterburg ().

===Germanization===
The process of Germanization of other ethnic groups was complex. It included direct and indirect Germanization. Old Prussians were welcomed with the same civil rights as Germans after they were converted, while the Old Prussian nobility waited to receive their rights. There were about nine thousand farms left empty after the plague of 1709, remedied by the Great East Colonization. Its final stage was 1736–1756. Germans revived the farms vacated by the plagues. Thus, the percentage of Germans increased to 13.4 percent in Prussian villages as well as in neighboring Lithuania, also stricken by the plague. By 1800, most Prussian Lithuanians were literate and bilingual in Lithuanian and German. There was no forced Germanization before 1873. After Germany was unified in 1871, Prussian Lithuanians were influenced by German culture, leading to the teaching of German in schools—a practice common throughout northern and eastern Europe. The Germanization of Lithuania Minor accelerated in the second half of the 19th century, when German was made compulsory in the education system at all levels, although newspapers and books were freely published and church services were held in the Lithuanian language, even during the Nazi era. At the same time, Lithuanian periodicals were printed in areas not far from Russian-controlled Lithuania, such as &quot;Auszra&quot; or &quot;Varpas&quot;, and smuggled into Lithuania proper. Between the two world wars, in the regions lost by Russia following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Russian and Jewish communists printed seditious literature in local languages until 1933.

==Culture==


The first book in Lithuanian, prepared by Martynas Mažvydas, was printed in Königsberg in 1547, while the first Lithuanian grammar, Daniel Klein&#x27;s &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot;, was printed there in 1653.

Lithuania Minor was the home of Vydūnas, philosopher and writer, and Kristijonas Donelaitis, pastor and poet and author of &quot;The Seasons&quot;, which mark the beginning of Lithuanian literature. &quot;The Seasons&quot; give a vivid depiction of the everyday life of Prussian Lithuanian country.

Lithuania Minor was an important center for Lithuanian culture, which was persecuted in Russian-controlled Lithuania proper. That territory had been slowly Polonized when being part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and was heavily Russificied while part of the Russian Empire, especially in the second half of the 19th century. During the ban on Lithuanian printing in Russia from 1864 until 1904, Lithuanian books were printed in East Prussian towns such as Tilsit, Ragnit, Memel, and Königsberg, and smuggled to Russia by &quot;knygnešiai&quot;. The first Lithuanian language periodicals appeared during the period in Lithuania Minor, such as &quot;Auszra&quot;, edited by Jonas Basanavičius, succeeded by &quot;Varpas&quot; by Vincas Kudirka. They had contributed greatly to the Lithuanian national revival of the 19th century.
