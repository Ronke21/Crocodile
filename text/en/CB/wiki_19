<text>The Kennedy curse is a series of deaths, accidents, assassinations, and other calamities involving members of the American Kennedy family. The alleged curse has primarily struck the descendants of businessman Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., but it has also affected family friends, associates, and other relatives. Political assassinations and plane crashes have been the most common manifestations of the &quot;curse&quot;. Following the Chappaquiddick incident in 1969, Ted Kennedy is quoted saying he questioned if &quot;some awful curse did actually hang over all the Kennedys.&quot; However skeptics argue that it is not improbable for a large extended family to experience similar events over the course of several generations.

A 2024 book, &quot;Ask Not: The Kennedys and the Women They Destroyed&quot; argues that the &quot;real curse&quot; is womanizing committed by male members of the family.

In January 2025, Caroline Kennedy accused Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of encouraging his siblings to abuse drugs, contributing to the curse. Next month, Robert Jr. was appointed United States secretary of health and human services.

==Chronology==
Events that have been treated as evidence of a curse include:
===Kennedy deaths=== 

* August 12, 1944 – Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died when the military aircraft he was piloting exploded over East Suffolk, England.
* September 9, 1944 – William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, newlywed husband of Kathleen Kennedy, was fatally shot by a German sniper while leading his company near Heppen, Belgium.

* August 1, 2019 – Saoirse Kennedy Hill, granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, died of an accidental drug overdose at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.
* April 2, 2020 – Maeve Kennedy McKean, granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, disappeared with her eight-year-old son, Gideon, during a short canoe trip in Chesapeake Bay. Their bodies were recovered from the bay later that week. Autopsies revealed that both had accidentally drowned in the turbulent and chilly water.
===Other incidents===

* November 1941 – Rosemary Kennedy, age 23, struggled to read and write, and she suffered from mood swings, seizures, and violent outbursts. During birth, Rosemary was deprived of oxygen as her mother and nurse waited for the doctor to arrive. As she grew older, she became more rebellious and the family worried she would do something that could tarnish the Kennedy reputation. In an attempt to cure or treat his daughter, Joseph Kennedy secretly arranged for her to undergo a prefrontal lobotomy, which was seen as a promising treatment for various mental illnesses. Instead of saving Rosemary, the now-discredited procedure left her mentally and physically incapacitated. Rosemary remained institutionalized in seclusion, in rural Wisconsin, until her death in 2005. Her family remained distant for most of Rosemary&#x27;s life, but Eunice Kennedy Shriver, her sister, grew close to her later in life. Eunice went on to found the Special Olympics and the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation which researches developmental and intellectual disabilities.
* June 19, 1964 – U.S. senator Ted Kennedy survived a plane crash that killed one of his aides as well as the pilot. The plane was on its way to a Democratic State Convention in Springfield. The plane crashed in an apple orchard near Southampton, Massachusetts. The senator was pulled from the wreckage by passenger (and fellow senator) Birch Bayh. Kennedy spent five months in a hospital recovering from a broken back, a punctured lung, broken ribs, and internal bleeding. Following the crash, Robert F. Kennedy remarked to aide Ed Guthman: &quot;Somebody up there doesn&#x27;t like us.&quot;

* July 18, 1969 – Ted Kennedy accidentally drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, resulting in the drowning death of 28-year-old passenger Mary Jo Kopechne. In his televised statement a week later, Ted said that on the night of the incident he wondered &quot;whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the Kennedys.&quot; Ted did not report the accident to the police until the next morning and pled guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident.
* August 13, 1973 – Joseph P. Kennedy II was the driver of a Jeep in Nantucket, Massachusetts that crashed and left his passenger, Pam Kelley, paralyzed. Fellow passenger and brother David A. Kennedy was injured.

* November 17, 1973 – Edward M. Kennedy Jr., age 12, had his right leg surgically amputated as a result of bone cancer. He underwent an experimental two-year drug treatment to cure the cancer.
* May 4, 2006 – U.S. congressman Patrick J. Kennedy crashed his automobile while intoxicated into a barricade on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., at 2:45 a.m. He later revealed an addiction to prescription medications Ambien and Phenergan and pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of prescription drugs, sentenced to one year probation and a fine of $350.

<doc id="801892" wikidata="Q1264812" url="?curid=801892" title="Dullahan">
<text>The Dullahan (Irish: Dubhlachan; dúlachán, ) is a type of legendary creature in Irish folklore. He is depicted as a headless rider on a black horse, or as a coachman, who carries his own head. As it is not widely attested in native sources, including no references to it on the Irish Folklore Commission&#x27;s website, there is doubt as to whether the Dullahan was originally a part of the Irish oral tradition.

==Etymology==
Dullahan or Dulachan ( [Duḃlaċan]) referring to &quot;hobgoblin&quot; (generic term; cf. Dullahan described as &quot;unseelie (wicked) fairy&quot;), literally &quot;signifies dark, sullen person&quot;, according to the lexicographer Edward O&#x27;Reilly. Dulachan and Durrachan are alternative words for this &quot;hobgoblin&quot;, and these forms suggest etymological descent from &quot;anger&quot; or &quot;malicious&quot; or &quot;fierce&quot;. The original Irish term contains the stem &quot;dubh,&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; in Irish.

Dullahan was later glossed as &quot;dark, angry, sullen, fierce or malicious being&quot;, encompassing both etymologies, though Thomas Crofton Croker considered the alternative etymology more dubious than the &quot;dubh&quot; &quot;black&quot; (&quot;dark&quot;) etymology.

The Dullahan is also called Colainn Gan Cheann, meaning &quot;without a head&quot; in Irish.

&quot;Headless Coach&quot; () or the &quot;Soundless Coach&quot; (literally &quot;deaf coach&quot;, ; Hiberno-English: &quot;Coshta Bower&quot;, corrupted to &quot;coach-a-bower&quot;) is the name given to Death coach|the vehicle driven by the Dullahan.

== Folk Beliefs ==

=== Description ===
He is depicted as a Headless Horseman, stereotypically on a black horse, and he is either a headless body without a head or he carries his own head in his hand or under his arm. The severed head has a revolting appearance, as in Croker&#x27;s tale &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot;:..such a head no mortal ever saw before. It looked like a large cream cheese hung round with black puddings: no speck of colour enlivened the ashy paleness of the depressed features; the skin lay stretched over the unearthly surface almost like the parchment head of a drum. Two fiery eyes of prodigious circumference, with a strange and irregular motion, flashed like meteors.

According to the modern storyteller Tony Locke of County Mayo, the Dullahan&#x27;s mouth, full of razor-sharp teeth, forms a grin reaching the sides of the head, its &quot;massive&quot; eyes &quot;constantly dart about like flies&quot;, and the flesh has acquired the &quot;smell, colour and consistency of mouldy cheese&quot;.

There are also legends and tales mentioning the &quot;Headless Coach&quot; (also called &quot;Coach-a-bower&quot;; ), with the Dullahan as its presumed driver. &quot;Cóiste Bodhar&quot; was referred to as &quot;Soundless Coach&quot; by Robert Lynd, who gave an account of a &quot;silent shadow&quot; of a coach passing by, provided by an avowed witness from Connemara. However William Butler Yeats explained that &quot;the &#x27;deaf coach&#x27; was so called because of its rumbling sound&quot;. According to one witness, only the silent shadow of the horse-drawn hearse, i.e., the &quot;Soundless Coach&quot; was seen passing by.

In Croker&#x27;s poem &quot;The Death Coach&quot;, the carriage axle is made of a human spine and the wheel-spokes are constructed from thigh bones. A later writer prosifying this description supplied additional details, so that the &quot;two hollow skulls&quot; used as lanterns on the carriage are set with candles, and the hammercloth made of pall material &quot;mildew&#x27;d by damps&quot; is embellished as being chewed away by worms.

=== Behavior ===
A Dullahan appears as a mounted horseman or a coachman driving a horse-drawn carriage out of graveyards. The rumour of a Dullahan&#x27;s appearance often develops near a graveyard or a charnel vault where a wicked aristocrat is reputed to be buried.

He arrives, driving the death coach, at the doorstep of a person whose death is approaching. According to Croker, the appearance of the &quot;Headless Coach&quot; foreshadows imminent death or misfortune. In &quot;Hanlon&#x27;s Mill&quot;, Michael (Mick) Noonan is returning from his trip to a shoemaker at Ballyduff, Co. Cork, and during his journey, he sees a black coach drawn by six headless black horses, driven by a headless coachman clad in black. The next morning, Mick receives news from the huntsman that Master Wrixon of Ballygibblin had a fit and died.

Croker reports that in one legend, a Headless Coach would run back and forth from Castle Hyde to a glen/valley beyond the village of Ballyhooly, in County Cork. Nearby in the town of Doneraile, it was said that the coach would visit the houses in succession, and whichever occupant dared to open the door would be splashed with a basin of blood by the coachman.

There are rumours that golden objects can force the Dullahan to disappear.

=== Sight ===
A modern commentator stated that the Dullahan has the ability to see with the severed head and can &quot;use it to scan the countryside for mortals about to die&quot;.

In contrast, the headless coach in the tale &quot;The Harvest Dinner&quot; is described as a &quot;blind (thief)&quot;, and Croker assumed he lacks sight.

=== Whip ===
The Dullahan allegedly uses a human spine as a whip according to a number of modern-day (21st century) commentators.

The headless coachman merely bears a &quot;long whip&quot; in Croker&#x27;s tale &quot;The Harvest Dinner&quot;, with which he lashes the horses so furiously, he almost strikes a witness blind in an eye (the would-be-victim regarded it as deliberate assault). Croker deduced that the headless creature, as a way of habit, attempts to destroy his witness&#x27;s eye or eyes with his whip, reasoning that the coachman&#x27;s wrath turns to the onlooker because he lacks the ability to look due to his headlessness.

==Folk Tales==
Croker&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland&quot; (1828) contained a section on &quot;The Dullahan&quot; devoted to the lore of headless beings.

The tale &quot;The Good Woman&quot; recounts a peasant&#x27;s encounter with a cloaked female who turns out to be a Dullahan. A peasant named Larry Dodd, a resident of &quot;White Knight&#x27;s Country&quot; at the foot the Galtee Mountains (Galtymore), travels (westward) to Cashel where he buys a nag, intending to sell it at Kildorrery fair that June evening. He offers a ride to a cloaked female, and when he grabs her to exact a kiss as payment for the ride, he discovers her to be a Dullahan. After losing consciousness, in the church ruins he finds a wheel of torture set with severed heads (skulls) and headless Dullahans, both men and women and nobles and commoners of various occupations. Larry is offered a drink, and when he is about to compliment it, his head is severed mid-sentence. His head reverts when he regains his senses. He loses his horse to the Dullahans.

Some believe the Dullahan to be the embodied spirit of the Celtic god Crom Dubh.

<doc id="801897" wikidata="Q211426" url="?curid=801897" title="Agathocles of Bactria">
<text>Agathocles I Dicaeus (, meaning &quot;Agathocles the just&quot;) was a Greco-Bactrian/Indo-Greek king, who reigned between around 190 and 180 BC, likely of the dynasty of Diodotus I, due to his commemoration of Antiochus Nicator. 

== Accounts and discovery==
There is a near-complete lack of written sources except an extensive coinage.

Agathocles was first discovered by Johann Martin Honigberger in 1834, with hoards of coins being discovered at a rapid pace. No sooner had Desiré-Raoul Rochette held him to be the founder of the Bactrian dynasty than he was rejected by Christian Lassen, who felt that Agathocles was a contemporary of Demetrius and Eucratides I.

== Biography ==

Agathocles&#x27; father may have been Diodotus II, and he would therefore have been illegitimate. Agathocles ruled and was probably the immediate successor of Pantaleon; he was a contemporaneous relative (maybe, son) of Demetrius I, who was busy expanding towards India. 

He was challenged by Antimachus I. Depending on the results, which is not accurately ascertainable, he was either immediately ousted by Antimachus I or a few years later, by an usurper Eucratides I.

== Coinage ==
No gold mints have been found. Bronze and silver mints were commonplace. Copper mints having significant Nickel were discovered by Flight in 1868; François Widemann believes them to have had an intermediate value between bronze and silver.

===Commemorative coinage===
Agathocles issued a series of coins mentioning a variety of rulers.

The first of these types was acquired by a Russian explorer Nicholai de Khanikoff from Bukhara and published by Jean-Jacques Barthélemy: on the obverse was the usual image of Diodotus but with an epithet of &quot;ΣΩΤΗΡΟΣ&quot; (savior) instead of basileus and on the reverse was the usual image of Zeus but with an additional inscription that read &quot;ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΟΝΤΟΣ ΑΓΑΘΟ­ΚΛΕΟΥΣ ΔΙΚΑΙΟΥ&quot; (Agathocles the Just, ruling as a King). This peculiar coinage led to significant debate among numismatists — Barthélemy had construed the coins to venerate a dead ancestor but Johann Gustav Droysen argued, to significant acclaim, that it meant Agathocles was ruling as a subordinate of Diodotus. 

Precisely similar coins but commemorating other rulers were located in the following decades — Euthydemus (1858) and Antiochus (1868). A coin of the same kind commemorating Diodotus but struck by Antimachus was also chanced upon. Scholars increasingly accepted the reasoning of Droysen and Cunningham proposed that Agathocles (alongside Antimachus) first ruled under Diodotus and then under Euthydemus and Antiochus. The general understanding of Bactrian Kingdom around the middle nineteenth century hold all of these Kings to be contemporaneous co-rulers. Among the rare dissenting voices was Alfred von Sallet who asserted that these &quot;ancestor coins&quot; were struck for the purpose of commemoration and rejected that these rulers were contemporary, based on the design of coins.

In 1880, a coin of the same kind struck by Agathocles but &quot;commemorating&quot; Alexander, Son of Philip was published by Percy Garnder of British Museum. That it was impossible for Agathocles to be a sub-king of someone who had ruled about two hundred years earlier, Droysen&#x27;s explanation was summarily rejected in favor of Sallet. Gardner proposed that these coins were struck to increase his public on the eve of an (eventually successful) challenge by Eucratides I. In the early-mid 1900, Hugh Rawinson and William Tarn would extrapolate Gardner&#x27;s ideas to further their visions of a grand Hellenistic past where Agathocles had faked his pedigree and Eucratides I was carrying out the orders of Antiochus IV to reestablish the Seleucid control. Other scholars generally avoided giving too much significance to these &quot;ancestor coins&quot;.

More varieties of these coins would be discovered later. These mention Diodotus II, Demetrius II and Demetrius. In the last few decades, such coins have been discovered in more numbers but the accuracy of these finds remain plagued by the fact that these did not came from controlled excavations but auction networks. They were evaluated by scholars only after they have traveled continents and passed through multiple hands.

It has been since accepted that these coins indeed represented Agathocles&#x27; predecessors. The precise context of minting and significance is still not clear.

===Religious coinage===

Agathocles was unique in issuing bilingual coinage. Meant for local circulation in Gandhara, they were typically of smaller denominations, square or rectangular in shape, and minted in bronze or silver. The obverse had his portrait labelled in Greek while the reverse had imagery from the Buddhist as well as Hindu pantheon alongside inscriptions in Brahmi/Kharosthi. Monolingual coinage (in Kharosthi) of similar kinds have been discovered. 

These finds have led scholars to conclude that Agathocles favored socio-religious tolerance. Osmund Bopearachchi hold him to have inaugurated the first Indo-Greek era; others have been skeptic.

==== Buddhist ====
Buddhist symbols such as the stupa and the &quot;tree in railing&quot; have been located in his coins. These coins sometimes use Brahmi, and sometimes Kharoshthi, whereas later Indo-Greek kings only used Kharoshthi. Lakshmi, goddess of abundance and fortune, appears in several of these coins.

==== Hindu ====

On 3 October 1970, six Indian-standard silver drachmas were discovered at the administrative quarters of Ai-Khanoum from a pilgrim&#x27;s water vessel by a team of French archaeologists. These coins are the first numismatic representations of Vedic deities and serve as key evidences about Bhagavatism being the first form of Vaishnavism in early India.

The coins display early Avatars of Vishnu: Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes of pestle and plow on reverse, and Vāsudeva-Krishna with attributes of Shankha and Sudarshana Chakra on obverse. On the bases of the coins bearing characteristic trademarks of Indian sculpture — frontal pose as opposed to three-quarter, stiff and starched folds in drapes, absence of proportions, and sideways disposition of feet — Audoin and Bernard speculated that the engravings were by Indian artists. Bopearachchi disputes the conclusion and points out the mis-representational depictions of Vāsudeva-Krishna&#x27;s chattra with a headdress and conch with a high-necked vase; he hypothesizes that a Greek artist had engraved the coin from a now-lost (or undiscovered) sculpture.

A dancing girl, found on the obverse of some Bronze coins of Agathocles are believed to be representations of Subhadra.

===Nickel coins===

Also, Agathocles and Pantaleon, along with their contemporary Euthydemus II, are unique in the ancient world, in that they were the first in the world to issue copper-nickel (75/25 ratio) coins, an alloy technology only known by the Chinese at the time (some weapons from the Warring States period were in copper-nickel alloy). These coins used the symbolism of Dionysos with a thyrsus over his left shoulder and his panther, which were his type for smaller coinage.

It has long been suggested that the nickel contained in the coins of Agathocles was ultimately of Chinese origin (Chinese Baitong, 白铜, &quot;white copper&quot;), and that they were indicative of the existence of trade links with China around that time. However, a recent archaeometallurgical study of trace elements has shown that nickel in these coins actually came from natural nickeliferous copper ore.

===Decipherment of the Brahmi script===

From 1834, some attempts were made to decipher the Brahmi script, the main script used in old Indian inscriptions such as the Edicts of Ashoka, and which had become extinct since the 5th century CE. Some attempts by Rev. J. Stevenson were made to identify characters from the Karla Caves () based on their similarities with the Gupta script of the Samudragupta inscription of the Allahabad pillar (4th century CE) which had just been deciphered, but this led to a mix of good (about 1/3) and bad guesses, which did not permit proper decipherment of the Brahmi.

The first successful attempts at deciphering the ancient Brahmi script of the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE were made in 1836 by Norwegian scholar Christian Lassen, who used the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of Indo-Greek kings Agathocles and Pantaleon to correctly and securely identify several Brahmi letters. The task was then completed by James Prinsep, an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the East India Company, who was able to identify the rest of the Brahmi characters, with the help of Major Cunningham. In a series of results that he published in March 1838 Prinsep was able to translate the inscriptions on a large number of rock edicts found around India, and provide, according to Richard Salomon, a &quot;virtually perfect&quot; rendering of the full Brahmi alphabet.

<doc id="801902" wikidata="Q3517041" url="?curid=801902" title="Ted Moses">
<text>Ted Moses (born 1950) is a Canadian politician from Eastmain, a small remote village in northern Quebec, Canada. He is a former Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees. In addition, Mr. Moses is a recipient of the title of &quot;Officer&quot; of the National Order of Quebec.

== Biography ==
Moses was born in Eastmain, Quebec, in the James Bay region of Quebec. After studying at Ryerson University in Toronto and McGill University in Montreal in school administration, he was Chief and Mayor of the village of Eastmain from 1987 to 1990. He was elected Grand Chief of the Crees in 1984. Moses is active on the international stage, speaking at numerous events about aboriginals and tolerance. He is the recipient of two honorary Doctorates of Law. 

== Career ==
=== La Paix des Braves ===
Moses assisted in obtaining recognition for the James Bay Crees as a &quot;Non-Governmental Organization&quot; in consultative status to the United Nations. He currently serves as the Ambassador of the Council at the UN. Moses was also involved in the signing of the &quot;Paix des Braves&quot; (French for &quot;Peace of the Brave&quot;). Along with Premier Bernard Landry and the government of Quebec, Moses and the Council developed this agreement. It has been described as a &quot;nation to nation&quot; declaration of peace after long legal disputes between Cree leaders and the Government of Quebec. The payments from the Quebec Government contained in the 1975 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. These obligations were transferred from the Quebec Government to the Cree government.

The Paix des Braves brought great controversy, but also many economic and social benefits to the Crees. The Cree communities voted in community referendums to accept the Paix des Braves. The approval was over 65%, with a majority voter turnout. The Paix des Braves now provides 77 million dollars per year to the Cree communities from the Quebec Government. These payments indexed by electricity, mineral, and forestry sales from the Cree traditional territory will last for 45 years. These payments from the Quebec Government will be replaced with payments from a Cree Heritage fund set up by the Cree by investing 15% of the present payments from the Quebec Government.
This was and still is widely seen as a symbolic show of mutual respect and recognition of the national status and right to self-determination of each people. It was put into concrete action when Ted Moses surprised many by supporting the re-election of Landry&#x27;s Parti Québécois in the 2003 Quebec election after years of oppositional attitudes of the Cree people towards Quebec sovereignty. He declared: 
:&quot;I support Bernard Landry... my friend and my brother... and I will recommend to my people to support the actual Member of Parliament of Ungava, Michel Létourneau.&quot;
(Ungava is the electoral riding of the Cree of Quebec.) Moses and the PQ leader have indeed become close: Landry invited Moses to his wedding on 26 June 2004.

During the campaign for the 2004 federal election, Moses also stated that he was counting on the Bloc Québécois, the PQ&#x27;s brother party in at the federal level of Canadian politics, to defend aboriginal rights at the federal level. Moses did not formally support the BQ, saying that it &quot;did not need it&quot; because of its considerable lead in polls. Furthermore, he declared in a speech in Europe that Quebec and the &quot;Paix des Braves&quot; were examples to follow for the world regarding relations with aboriginal peoples.

==After La Paix ==
In 2005, Moses was defeated in his bid for Grand Chief of the Crees of Eeyou Istchee by a wide margin, taking 31.9% of the vote . He was again defeated in the second round of voting, this time taking 43.3% of the vote .

<text>Dionne Farris (born December 4, 1969) is an American singer and songwriter. Born and raised in New Jersey, she began singing in elementary school and competed in pageants as a teenager. In the early 1990s, she was featured on the hip hop group Arrested Development&#x27;s hit single &quot;Tennessee&quot; (1992).

Farris found success with the release of her debut album, &quot;Wild Seed – Wild Flower&quot; (1994) on Columbia Records. The album featured the US top ten single, &quot;I Know&quot; (1995). The music video earned Farris the Billboard Music Video Awards Best Pop/Rock New Artist Clip of the Year. She was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1996 .

==Early life==
Farris was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, the daughter of Larraine (Wall) and Richard Farris, both of whom had musical talents and aspirations, and named Dionne for their favorite singer Dionne Warwick. Farris was raised in Bordentown, New Jersey by her single mother, whose side of the family introduced her to the musical acts that shaped and influenced her. Farris was a huge fan of Diana Ross as a child – one of Farris’ fonder memories was attending a Ross concert in New York City at the age of eight, being lifted by her uncle onstage, and getting kissed by Ross.

Farris began taking dance lessons at the age of three at Irene Parker Dance Studio in Hamilton Township, New Jersey. She danced ballet, jazz, tap, and toe for 10 years, opting at 13 to sing instead. She sang in her high school&#x27;s choir.

After graduating from Bordentown Regional High in 1987, Farris attended Mercer County Community College, where she studied photography. Farris entered into the Miss Hemisphere Pageant regional competitions, directly after high school and won her first and only pageant as 1987&#x27;s Miss Hemisphere&#x27;s Adult Talent, singing Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot; in Miami, Florida. She joined a band known as 2.0 and later as Breaking Ground. They began performing on the Manhattan&#x27;s club circuit, and looked to sign a record deal. Farris decided to move to Atlanta with her then boyfriend Donald &quot;Rasa Don&quot; Jones (one of the early members of Arrested Development), where her father lived. After a short time, Farris met with Atlanta producer Jermaine Dupri and began writing songs for Atlanta-based acts such as TLC and singing backgrounds for acts such as Xscape, and El Debarge. She signed a management contract with Michael Mauldin&#x27;s (father of Dupri) company as a solo artist, but later became a member of a girl group they were producing, known as Onyx.

==Career==

===Arrested Development===
Farris and the musical group Arrested Development were signed to the same management company. The group wanted a female singer for their &quot;3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of...&quot; album and Farris agreed to sing with the group although she was not an official member. Farris sang on three songs with the group: &quot;Fishin&#x27; 4 Religion&quot;, &quot;Give a Man a Fish&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot;. Farris performed &quot;Tennessee&quot; with Arrested Development on the 1992 MTV Movie Awards and &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; as well as being invited on the group&#x27;s first national tour. After the success of &quot;Tennessee&quot;, she began to receive media attention alongside the group , and Duff Marlo offered Farris a record deal, contingent upon Speech producing the project, but she rejected the offer in search of a deal where she would have artistic control. Farris began experiencing personal and business conflicts with Arrested Development&#x27;s group leader, despite the success of &quot;Tennessee&quot; (the group&#x27;s first and biggest hit in 1992). Farris was never an official member of the group, and she and the group parted ways in September 1992 before a show at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, Georgia after having an argument with group leader Speech and co-leader Headliner.

===&quot;Wild Seed – Wild Flower&quot;===
Farris reached out to Milton Davis and David Harris and began a collaboration. A demo sent to Sony Music was first reviewed by Bobby Colomby, then by Randy Jackson (who became known as a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot;). Jackson signed Farris to a deal at Columbia Records. Her debut album, &quot;Wild Seed – Wild Flower&quot; (1994), featured the 1995 single &quot;I Know&quot;, which reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1996. In the UK Singles Chart, &quot;I Know&quot; peaked (after a re-release) at No. 41 in May 1995. &quot;Wild Seed – Wild Flower&quot; reached No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; magazine ranked &quot;I Know&quot; as the number-one most played song on mainstream Top 40/CHR radio stations for 1995 and spent 10 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart (April 1 – June 3, 1995).

On April 8, 1995, she was the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing &quot;I Know&quot; and a roots acoustic rendition of the Beatles song &quot;Blackbird.&quot;

===Soundtracks===
In 1995, her version of Billy Taylor&#x27;s &quot;I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the documentary &quot;The Promised Land&quot;. It appeared again as the opening song to the film &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot;, about the true story of the 1994 trial of Byron De La Beckwith, the white supremacist accused of the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers. Farris&#x27; soundtrack work continued for the movie &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;, in which she contributed a version of the Stevie Wonder classic &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; as the closing song and the movie &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; with a rendition of Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Heartbreak Road&quot;. Her single &quot;Hopeless&quot; (written by Van Hunt) appears on the &quot;Love Jones&quot; soundtrack (1997).

===&quot;For Truth If Not Love&quot;===
Farris recorded a second album &quot;For Truth if Not Love&quot; but she experienced creative differences with the label she was signed to, Columbia Records, and the album went unreleased by Columbia. A contract dispute between Farris and the label followed and the label subsequently released Farris. The album was released approximately twelve years later in 2007, issued on iTunes.

===Independent releases===
Farris released her official follow-up album &quot;Signs of Life&quot; in (2011), named Top 10 soul albums of 2011, a mixtape &quot;Lady Dy, the Mixtape Pt 1&quot; (2011) and a live jazz album &quot;Dionne Get Your Gunn: Featuring the Russell Gunn Quartet with Dionne Farris&quot; (2012) via PledgeMusic crowd funding on her own record label, Free &amp; Clear Records.

==Personal life==
Farris has a daughter, rapper Baby Tate, whose father is former Follow for Now member David Ryan Harris.

<doc id="801910" wikidata="Q2050930" url="?curid=801910" title="H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen">
<text>Hendricus Gerardus van de Sande Bakhuyzen (April 2, 1838, in The Hague – January 8, 1923, in Leiden) was a Dutch astronomer. His surname, van de Sande Bakhuyzen, is sometimes erroneously given as Backhuyzen or Bakhuysen. His first name is sometimes given as Hendrik Gerard.

He studied astronomy under Frederik Kaiser.
After he got his degree, he was a high school teacher from 1864–1867, during which time he wrote a very successful textbook on mechanics. In 1867 he became a professor at the Technical College in Delft.
He became director of the Leiden Observatory in 1872 upon the death of Frederik Kaiser. He retired in 1908. Van de Sande Bakhuyzen became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1872.

He chose to concentrate on fundamental astronomy rather than on the then-new field of spectroscopy. He worked mainly on the observation of asteroids, but also proved the connection between a meteor shower on November 27 and the comet 3D/Biela. He also worked on geodesy.

He edited and published the Mars drawings of Johann Hieronymus Schröter in 1881, long after the latter&#x27;s death.

He married Geertruida van Vollenhoven, who died in 1910. They had two daughters and a son, Adriaan, who would be mayor of Leiden from 1927 to 1941.

His brother Ernest-Frederich van de Sande Bakhuyzen was also an astronomer who worked at the Leiden Observatory.

Bakhuysen crater (with an &quot;s&quot;) on Mars is named for him.

<text>Heliocles I (, meaning &quot;glory of Helios&quot;; reigned c. 145–120 BC) was a Greco-Bactrian king, brother and successor of Eucratides the Great, and considered the last Greek king to reign over the Bactrian country. His reign was a troubled one; according to Roman historian Justin, Eucratides was murdered crossing the Hindu Kush by one of his sons, although this is highly disputed and Justin fails to name the perpetrator. Eucratides’ death led to instability, even civil war, which caused the Indian parts of the empire to be lost to Indo-Greek king Menander I and southern Bactria to be lost to the Yuezhi.
==Yuezhi invasion==
From 130 BC a nomadic people, the Yuezhi, started to invade Bactria from the north and we could assume that Heliocles was killed in battle during this invasion. Details from Chinese sources seem to indicate that the nomad invasion did not end civilisation in Bactria entirely. Hellenised cities continued to exist for some time, and the well-organised agricultural systems were not demolished.

The Yuezhi would copy and adapt the coin types of Heliocles I for a long time after the latter&#x27;s death.

Heliocles I used the Greek epithet Dikaios (&quot;the Just&quot;) on his coins. There is evidence that Heliocles I ruled around the same time as Eucratides II, as a silver coin has been discovered showing both rulers sharing the coin in a joint issue.

<doc id="801913" wikidata="Q286569" url="?curid=801913" title="Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny">
<text>is an anime television series, a direct sequel to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; by Sunrise and the overall tenth installment in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. It retains most of the staff from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, including Director Mitsuo Fukuda. Set two years after the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, the plot follows the new character Shinn Asuka, a soldier from the Zodiac Alliance of Freedom Treaty, or ZAFT, composed of humans born genetically enhanced labelled as Coordinators. As ZAFT is about to enter into another war against the regular human race, the Naturals, the series focuses on Shinn&#x27;s as well as various returning characters&#x27; involvement in the war. The series spanned 50 episodes, aired in Japan from October 2004 to October 2005, on the Japan News Network television stations Tokyo Broadcasting System and Manichi Broadcasting System.

In December 2005, Sunrise aired a special episode that remade the events from the series&#x27; last episode. A series of four films compiling the series has also been released in Japan. &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was adapted into various manga adaptations and light novels published by Kodansha and Kadokawa Shoten. Bandai Entertainment licensed the series for North America release, and has published it in DVD volumes. The series also aired on television in Canada, while the compilation films were also released in DVDs. The first manga was licensed and published by Del Rey Manga. Various types of merchandising have also been released, including CD soundtracks and video games. In 2013, a HD remaster of the series was released by Sunrise.

&quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; became highly popular in Japan, having sold over one million DVD volumes and soundtracks topping charts. The series was also the winner of the Anime Grand Prix in both 2004 and 2005 polls. Critical reception has also been positive with focus on the themes and events occurring throughout the series. However, &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; has often been compared with its predecessor for sharing similar situations with the director&#x27;s cut OVA having helped to improve an ending that was felt to be weak.

A sequel film titled &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom&quot; was released in January 2024.

==Plot==
&quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; sets the story two years after the original series and it starts when the leader from Orb, Cagalli Yula Athha, reunites with the PLANTs&#x27; Supreme Council chairman Gilbert Durandal to discuss the construction of new mobile suits made for the military organization ZAFT. Three of them are stolen by a group called Phantom Pain, which is controlled by the Blue Cosmos terrorist organization. Cagalli&#x27;s bodyguard Athrun Zala joins ZAFT pilot Shinn Asuka to stop them. During the fight, ZAFT&#x27;s battleship Minerva is ordered to destroy the ruins of a space colony to prevent it from crashing into Earth. They find out that rogue ZAFT soldiers are controlling the colony in order to crash it into Earth. After failing to completely destroy the colony, a second war starts between the factions, the Earth Alliance and ZAFT, once news has spread that ZAFT soldiers caused the colony to collide on Earth. The neutral country of Orb allies with the Earth Alliance, with the former having also joined Blue Cosmos. This leads these three faction to confront the ZAFT soldiers several times, with Athrun having returned there.

Later in the war, the Archangel battleship interferes in the fights between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance&#x27;s faction. Allied with the Archangel, Cagalli fails to stop her country from fighting and the Archangel intervenes. Athrun becomes disaffected after Gilbert Durandal orders the destruction of his friend Kira Yamato and the Archangel, deeming them as enemies. He defects with Meyrin Hawke when Durandal frames him as a traitor. Cagalli is able to regain leadership from Orb, causing the Blue Cosmos&#x27; members to flee to space. The leader of Blue Cosmos, Lord Djibril, orders the super weapon Requiem to be fired which destroys several space colonies of PLANT, resulting in many deaths. The crew of the Minerva successfully kills Lord Djibril and capture the Requiem. Gilbert Durandal then announces the &quot;Destiny Plan&quot;, a plan where a person&#x27;s job or task will be based on their genetics, and uses the Requiem to destroy anyone who opposes him. This brings Shinn and the crew of the Minerva into direct conflict with the Archangel faction. Kira and Athrun with their new mobile suits and their allies, defeat the ZAFT forces and destroy the Requiem. Durandal is killed by one of his own followers, Rey Za Burrel.

The series&#x27; ending was expanded in both the original video animation and the last compilation film. Soon after Durandal&#x27;s death, the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, and the Orb Union meet to end the war, with Lacus Clyne acting as the negotiator. After fighting between each other various time in their mobile suits, Kira and Shinn meet in person for the second time and promise to join forces for a better future.

==Production==
&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; was first announced in July 2004 in Japanese magazines. Earlier, voice actor Tomokazu Seki had stated he was working on a popular show with fans hinting it was related to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;. Next month, the first trailer from the series was hosted online in its official website. Before the series&#x27; premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn&#x27;s character, telling that the &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;″s protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance. The main staff from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; remained in &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; including director Mitsuo Fukuda. When the series was premiering in Japan, Fukuda stated that unlike &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, the sequel would not focus on Kira&#x27;s and Athrun&#x27;s relationship, but on Shinn&#x27;s involvement in the war. He addressed that such conflict would happen in the series, but refrained from giving its reasons. In order to add more entertainment to the series, the staff also worked on the fight scenes between mobile suits. Shinn&#x27;s character was meant to contrast Kira&#x27;s in regards to their involvement across the series, but as Kira did, he would also go through a major development.

Kira&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Destiny&quot; was made in order to tell a story from three people&#x27;s point of views: Kira&#x27;s, Athrun&#x27;s and Shinn. The director lamented that from the three protagonists, Kira was the least explored character during the making of the series alongside two other characters with major importance: Durandal and Lacus. Fukuda described Kira in &quot;SEED Destiny&quot; as a person who runs away from fights often despite his feelings for Orb. His characterization was made to change briefly across the story as Kira faced Gilbert Durandal&#x27;s ideals and became a person more compromised with war in contrast to his original pacifist persona after this incarnation was challenged by multiple other characters in regards to his actions on the battlefield.

Comcast Cable aired the 50th English episode at the end of February 2008. Due to the closure of Bandai Entertainment, the series has been out-of-print. On October 11, 2014, at their 2014 New York Comic Con panel, Sunrise announced they will be releasing all of the Gundam franchise, including &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; in North America though distribution from Right Stuf Inc., beginning in Spring 2015. Sunrise released the HD remaster of SEED Destiny in North America with a brand new English dub produced by NYAV Post on November 9, 2021.

===Compilation films===

A film version of the TV series was released as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition&quot;, which retells the story in four 90 minute parts.

===Theatrical film===
Although a plot was written, production did not go ahead on the &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; theatrical film. It would have been the first full-length film within the &quot;Gundam&quot; metaseries since &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam F91&quot; (1991), but because of the delays the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot; film instead held that mantle. This film was first announced on May 6, 2006, at the Sony Music Anime Fes&#x27; 06 with a brief clip featuring the characters Shinn Asuka, Cagalli Yula Athha, Lacus Clyne, Kira Yamato, and Athrun Zala. After the Sony Music Anime Fes&#x27; 06, Sunrise announced the film on their website.

Houko Kuwashima, voice actress of character Stella Loussier, has stated on her &quot;SEED Club blog&quot; that the character will somehow also have a role in the film. Lacus, Yzak Joule, and Dearka Elsman will return as members of the PLANT Supreme Council and Kira, Shinn, and Lunamaria Hawke will be part of the ZAFT military.

In the April 2008 edition of the &quot;Animage&quot; magazine, writer Chiaki Morosawa explained that although she has managed to complete the outline for the plot, the requirement of continuous treatment for her illness has led to the indefinite postponement of the project. Chiaki Morosawa later died on February 19, 2016. However, Takanori Nishikawa mentioned at the Gundam 40th Fes. “Live-Beyond” concert in 2019 that he was told by a staff member that the film was still in pre-production. On May 28, 2021, the film was announced as being in production. It was released in January 2024.

===Manga===
Several manga series based on the &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; story have been released.

Three soundtrack albums featuring music composed by Toshihiko Sahashi were released during the 2004-2005 series run. These were the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Original Soundtrack&quot;s, numbered by Roman numerals from &quot;I&quot; through &quot;III&quot;. &quot;Soundtrack I&quot; contained a new song by Rie Tanaka and was released on December 16, 2004, &quot;Soundtrack II&quot; included a new song by Houko Kuwashima and was released on April 21, 2005, and &quot;Soundtrack III&quot; contained series theme music by Yuki Kajiura and was released on August 24, 2005.

In similar fashion to the original &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, the songs were performed by a mix of high-profile and up-and-coming artists. As before, a number of the featured songs became top-charting singles such as T.M.Revolution&#x27;s &quot;Ignited&quot;. The third opening theme, &quot;Bokutachi no Yukue&quot; was performed by fifteen-year-old newcomer Hitomi Takahashi, and released on April 13, 2005.

These include &quot;Honoo no Tobira&quot;, performed by FictionJunction Yuuka. and &quot;vestige&quot;, performed by T.M.Revolution.

Two compilation albums including the credit themes and insert songs were also released, as well as an additional album including music from both &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. The first compilation disc, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Complete Best&quot;, was released on May 7, 2006, and included all eight themes with remixes. A deluxe version of this same album which included a box and a DVD containing the opening and ending animation footage was also released. A two-disc set, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED – SEED DESTINY Best: THE BRIDGE&quot;, contained music from both series as well as the character &quot;Suit&quot; series and was released on November 22, 2006. The first-press version of this album included a booklet, art card, and poster.

Kodansha also published three series of magazines under the label of &quot;Official File&quot; that focus on characters&#x27; and mobile suits&#x27; analysis.

==Reception==
The series has been highly popular in Japan, having won the &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix awards for best anime in the 2004 and 2005 polls. In both of these polls, Athrun Zala, Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne have also topped the most popular characters categories, with the last episode and the OVA also occupying their own category. DVD sales have been good, with various of them appearing in official Japanese rankings. In November 2005, Bandai Visual announced that &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; had sold over one million DVD volumes in Japan. Soundtracks have also been popular with both themes from T.M. Revolution and Nami Tamaki topping Oricon charts during their release. In the Recording Industry Association of Japan&#x27;s awards, &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; was the winner in the category of animation album. In the Anime Nation&#x27;s top selling DVDs, the twelfth &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; volume ranked ninth.

Critical reception for &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; has been positive but it was often compared with &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;. &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;″s backstory was noted to be essential for the plot of &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; to the point that Maria Lin considered that it was required to watch the former to fully understand the series. The new cast of characters was well-received with the relationship between Rey Za Burrel and Neo Roanoke bringing speculations regarding their identities due to how it mirrored one from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;. However, initial reaction to lead character Shinn Asuka has been mixed due to his antagonistic personality and how some of the new and returning characters overshadowed his role in the series. While at some points Shinn&#x27;s role and relationships were found entertaining, UK Anime&#x27;s Ross Liversidge liked how returning character Kira Yamato took bigger role in the series as he was more likable.

Still, the themes from the series have also been praised for being entertaining and debatable despite also sharing it with other Gundam series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment further commented on this, stating that while it brings parallels other series, &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;″s themes are &quot;also done well enough that it stands firmly on its own.&quot; The last episodes were criticized for bringing situations similar to the ones from the ending of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;. In contrast, the fight scenes occurring in these episodes were praised alongside the emotional impact brought by some scenes. The OVA repraising the events from the series&#x27; last episode was praised for explaining events from &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; such as Gilbert Durandal&#x27;s discussions with Rau Le Creuset. It was also noted make a more satisfying ending, allowing to develop more of their characters with the emotional focus being more explored than in the television series&#x27; finale.

The series&#x27; animation was highly praised for the coloring and character designs. The mobile suits&#x27; designs have been well-received despite the fact they transformed, something considered cheesy by Anime News Network&#x27;s Paul Fargo. The fight scenes were also noted to be the main focus from the televisions series&#x27; last episodes, as they brought entertaining action scenes with the new mechas introduced. However, the OVA was noted to downplay these scenes, with some of them being hard to fully understand. Soundtracks also had praise for bringing enjoyable themes and the return from Nami Tamaki. Fargo stated that composer Toshihiko Sahashi notably improved his scores from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, with artists&#x27; opening and ending themes also being entertaining. The Japanese voice was noted to bring popular idols such as Maaya Sakamoto, resulting in an enjoyable one. On the other hand, response to the English casting was mixed with some actors making appealing portrayals while in other cases poor ones. Nevertheless, Don Houston from DVD Talk advised viewers to listen to the English dub rather than the original Japanese version, having noticed that some sound effects were remixed and thus improved the audio.

In July 2021, media reporting on the wake of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III noted that the song “Kimi wa Boku ni Niteiru” from the Gundam Suit Destiny series as military honor guards escorted his urn to the front of the Ateneo de Manila University&#x27;s Church of Gesu where his memorial service would be held. This resulted in some speculation that President Aquino, a known gamer, may have been a fan of the series.

<doc id="801914" wikidata="Q250732" url="?curid=801914" title="John Linnell (painter)">
<text>John Linnell (16 June 179220 January 1882) was an English engraver, and portrait and landscape painter. He was a naturalist and a rival to the artist John Constable. He had a taste for Northern European art of the Renaissance, particularly Albrecht Dürer. He also associated with the amateur artist Edward Thomas Daniell, and with William Blake, to whom he introduced the painter and writer Samuel Palmer and others of the Ancients.

==Life and work==

John Linnell was born in Bloomsbury, London on 16 June 1792, where his father was a carver and gilder. He was in contact with artists from an early age, and by the age of ten was drawing and selling portraits in chalk and pencil. His first art teacher was the American-born artist Benjamin West, and he spent a year in the house of the painter John Varley, where William Hunt and William Mulready were also pupils, and made the acquaintance of Shelley, Godwin and others. In 1805 he was admitted to study at the Royal Academy, where he obtained medals for drawing, modelling and sculpture. He was trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of Varley&#x27;s &quot;Burial of Saul.&quot;
In 1808, the 16-year-old Linnell moved into Mulready&#x27;s house, whose wife had accused him of infidelity with both other women and boys. Linnell&#x27;s association with Mulready may have caused the breakup of Mulready&#x27;s marriage.
In 1817 Linnell married Mary Ann Palmer in Scotland and they had nine children together including their first born, Hannah Linnell, who later married the landscape painter Samuel Palmer.

In later life Linnell occupied himself with the burin, publishing, in 1833, a series of outlines from Michelangelo&#x27;s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, and, in 1840, superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures in Buckingham Palace, one of them, a Titian landscape, which he engraved in mezzotint. At first he supported himself mainly by miniature painting and execution of larger portraits, such as the likenesses of Mulready, Richard Whately, Peel and Thomas Carlyle. Several of his portraits he engraved in line and mezzotint.

He painted many subjects like the &quot;St John Preaching&quot;, the &quot;Covenant of Abraham&quot;, and the &quot;Journey to Emmaus&quot;, in which, while the landscape is usually prominent the figures are of sufficient importance to supply the title of the work. However, it is mainly in connection with paintings of pure landscapes that his name is known. His works commonly deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape, which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset. They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing in colour.

Linnell commanded large prices for his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill, Surrey, where he lived till his death on 20 January 1882, painting with unabated powers until within the last few years of his life. He devoted himself to painting landscapes notably of the North Downs and Kentish Weald. His leisure was occupied with a study of the Bible in the original language. He also published several pamphlets and treatises of Biblical criticism. Linnell was one of the best friends and kindest patrons of William Blake. He gave him the two largest commissions he received for single series of designs—£150 for drawings and engravings of &quot;The Inventions to the Book of Job&quot;, and a like sum for those illustrative of Dante Aligheri.

He was a friend of the painter Edward Thomas Daniell. A blue plaque commemorates Linnell at Old Wyldes&#x27; at North End, Hampstead. The plaque mentions that William Blake stayed with Linnell as his guest.

His eldest son William Linnell (1826-1906) was also an artist most noted for his 1840 drawing of Smugglerius, which is an écorché sculpture of a man posed in imitation of the ancient Roman sculpture known as the Dying Gaul.

<doc id="801924" wikidata="Q1295286" url="?curid=801924" title="Waverley Abbey">
<text>Waverley Abbey was the first Cistercian abbey in England, founded in 1128 by William Giffard, the Bishop of Winchester.

Located about southeast of Farnham, Surrey, it is situated on a flood-plain; surrounded by current and previous channels of the River Wey. It was damaged on more than one occasion by severe flooding, resulting in rebuilding in the 13th century. Despite being the first Cistercian abbey in England, and being motherhouse to several other abbeys, Waverley was &quot;slenderly endowed&quot; and its monks are recorded as having endured poverty and famine.

The abbey was suppressed in 1536 as part of King Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries. Subsequently, largely demolished, its stone was reused in local buildings, likely including &quot;Waverley Abbey House&quot;, which was built in 1723 in the northern portion of the former abbey precinct.

Waverley Abbey House, the ruins of the abbey and the surrounding land are all part of a conservation area. The house is a Grade II* listed building and the ruins a scheduled monument.

The ruins of the abbey are currently managed by English Heritage and open to the public.

==History==
Waverley Abbey was founded by Bishop William Giffard on 24 November 1128. The first abbot and 12 monks were brought from L&#x27;Aumône Abbey in Normandy, France.

Giffard endowed the new abbey with all the land within the parish of Waverley, two acres of meadow at Elstead, and gave the monks permission to cut wood from his woodland at Farnham. Giffard&#x27;s successor as Bishop of Winchester, Henry of Blois (younger brother of King Stephen) donated a virgate (30 acres) of land at Wandford and gave further rights at Farnham, with permission to &quot;dig turf, heath, stone and sand&quot;.

Henry&#x27;s brother King Stephen granted the abbey land at Neatham, and (&quot;at the request of his brother&quot;) freed the abbey from the military obligations usually required of feudal landlords (Frankalmoin), and excused the abbey from the payment of certain taxes including the Danegeld. The abbey was freed from further taxes (tithes) by a papal bull issued by Pope Eugenius III in 1147.
The abbey&#x27;s endowment was added to by Adeliza of Louvain (wife of King Henry I), who donated the grange at Northolt. Faramus of Boulogne, nephew of King Stephen, sold the manor of Wanborough to the abbey for 125 marks of silver. The abbey&#x27;s endowment and privileges were confirmed by charters issued by King Richard I and King John.

Despite the donations, the abbey was described as &quot;slenderly endowed&quot;, and was recorded as having an income of only £98 1s. 8d. in the 1291 Taxation Roll. &#x27;A History of the County of Surrey&#x27; states: &quot;Contrasted with the vast estates of a foundation like Bermondsey [Abbey], such a modest rent roll sinks into insignificance&quot;. Despite the small income, the abbey seems to have been home to a large number of monks, with 120 lay brothers and 70 religious brothers recorded in 1187.

Within the abbey&#x27;s first 200 years, seven of the abbey&#x27;s monks were chosen to become abbots at other monasteries. As the first Cistercian Abbey in England, it became motherhouse of several other Cistercian houses: including Garendon Abbey, founded in Leicestershire by Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester; Forde Abbey, founded in Dorset by Richard de Brioniis; Coombe Abbey, founded in Warwickshire by Richard de Camville; and Thame Abbey, founded in Oxfordshire by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln. Many of these became mother-houses themselves, to other Cistercian monasteries. For a time, the Abbot of Waverley Abbey claimed precedence over all the other Cistercian Abbots in England; however, this was disputed by the Abbot of Furness Abbey.
===13th century===
The 13th century was a difficult time for the abbey. In July 1201 the abbey was flooded &quot;and all but carried away&quot; by a storm which caused the abbey&#x27;s crops to fail. The abbey was rebuilt during the 13th century, and much of the remains visible today date from this period. Construction on the new abbey church began in March 1203-04, financed by William, Rector of Broadwater; however, the abbey&#x27;s monks were struck by famine and forced to beg food from other monastic houses.

Following a dispute with the pope, in 1208 King John confiscated all ecclesiastical property; however, the same year he spent &quot;the last days of Holy Week&quot; at Waverley Abbey, and allowed the return of its possessions to allow them to continue the reconstruction of the church. Two years later, after the Cistercian order refused to give in to John&#x27;s demands for money, John withdrew all of the abbey&#x27;s privileges. Many of the monks fled the abbey and, in fear, the abbot &quot;fled away by night&quot;. King John then issued a decree forbidding any Cistercians to enter or leave the country.

In 1212 John confiscated all of the Cistercian Order&#x27;s property using &quot;false letters&quot; which &quot;reigned their property to him&quot;. The situation improved when John&#x27;s dispute with the pope ended. The persecution of Waverley appears to have ended by October 1214, when the abbot was sent on official business on behalf of the King. The church&#x27;s construction appears to have carried on throughout the difficult period, as on 10 July 1214 five altars were consecrated by Albin, Bishop of Ferns.

In 1225 the abbey was visited by King Henry III; he took communion at the abbey on 16 December 1225. Construction of the church was not completed, however, until 1278 (74/5 years after it began), when Nicholas de Ely, Bishop of Winchester blessed the church in honor of the Virgin Mary. The blessing was followed by a feast supposedly attended by 7,066 people; including six abbots and many knights and ladies.

The abbey&#x27;s difficult century continued with further floods in 1233; up to 8 ft in height, the flood destroyed several of the abbey&#x27;s bridges and property. Another flood on 28 November 1265 flooded the abbey&#x27;s lower buildings forcing the monks &quot;to take refuge in the church&quot;. In 1291 the abbey was described as in &quot;grievous poverty&quot; after their crops had failed.

The &quot;Annals of Waverley&quot;, written by the monks, records notable national and international events from the 10th to the late 13th centuries.

===Dissolution===
The &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus&quot; of 1535 records the abbey as having a clear annual income of £174 8s. 3½d. As such it was dissolved with the lesser (poorer) monasteries in 1536, as part of King Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries. There were only thirteen monks in the community at the time.

==History after the Dissolution==

Following dissolution the former abbey was granted to Sir William Fitzherbert, who was the treasurer of the king&#x27;s household. The abbey itself was mostly demolished, with stone reused in local building work including at Loseley Park.

Waverley Abbey House was built within the former abbey precinct, just north of the core abbey ruins. The east service court contains masonry from an earlier building, thought to date from the period just after the dissolution. The house was constructed in 1725 for Sir John Aislabie, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, to a design by Colen Campbell, possibly for the use of John&#x27;s brother William, who had recently returned from India. William died the same year and the house was sold to Charles Child of Guildford, who in turn sold it to Thomas Orby Hunter in 1847.

Later in the century Orby Hunter added wings, with further additions by Sir Robert Rich, 5th Baronet before 1786. It was bought around 1796 by the merchant John (later Poulett) Thomson, from Sir Charles Rich, 1st Baronet. He sold it about 1832 to George Thomas Nicholson, who rebuilt it after a fire in 1833.

In the 20th century Waverley Abbey was owned by the Anderson family. Rupert Darnley Anderson, son of Thomas Darnley Anderson of Liverpool, inherited it from his brother Charles Rupert Anderson in 1894. His father had purchased it around 1869.

Waverley Abbey House is now separated from the ruins by an artificial lake.

===World Wars===
During the First World War the house was the first country house to be converted into a military hospital. It treated over 5,000 soldiers.

Part of the former abbey site formed part of the defenses called the &quot;GHQ Line&quot;, set up to protect London during the Second World War. The abbey precinct contains numerous WWII relics including anti-tank gun emplacements, possible auxiliary unit bases, &quot;hideouts&quot;, pillboxes, &quot;anti-tank pimples&quot; and &quot;cylinders&quot;, and anti-tank roadblocks and ditches.

===Today===
Following the wars Waverley Abbey House became a nursing home. In 1983 it was purchased (and subsequently restored) by the Christian not-for-profit organisation, CWR. The house is currently used by CWR as a training and conference centre.

The ruins of the original abbey are managed by English Heritage and open to the public.

==Architectural description and remains==
Waverley Abbey followed the typical arrangement of English Monasteries. The Abbey church, which was around 91 meters long, sat to the north of the monastic complex. To the south of the church was the cloister, the eastern range of which contained the chapter house and monk&#x27;s dormitory. The southern range of the cloister contained the refectory and latrines. The eastern range contained the lay brothers&#x27; refectory and dormitory. The cemetery was located to the east and north of the abbey church.

The abbey&#x27;s immediate precinct occupied around 50 acres, with the River Wey forming the southern and eastern boundaries. In addition to the core abbey complex, the precinct contained buildings such as the brewhouse and features such as fishponds to supply food.

===The ruins===

Only part of the abbey remains standing, with the ruins dating from the abbey&#x27;s 13th-century reconstruction. The most substantial remains are that of the vaulted undercroft, or cellar, of the lay brother&#x27;s refectory, and the walls of the monk&#x27;s dormitory, which largely survive to roof height. There also survives the remains of the chapter house and traces of the north and south transepts of the abbey church.

Earthworks in the eastern portion of the abbey&#x27;s precinct reveal the remains of several fishponds and a &quot;water supply system&quot;.

The site was excavated by the Surrey Archaeological Society between 1890 and 1903, and the ruins restored in 1966 when the site was under the care of the Ministry of Works.

The ruins, Waverley Abbey House, and the surrounding land were all designated a conservation area in 1989. Waverley Abbey House is protected as a Grade II* Listed Building, while the abbey ruins are a scheduled monument.

===Ancient yew tree===

A yew tree (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot;), which is nearly 500 years old, grows on the ruins of the walls on the southeast corner of the church. In 2022, it won the UK Tree of the Year competition organised by the Woodland Trust.

===High risk of flooding===
In 2014, an English Heritage report identified that there is a high risk of flooding at Waverley Abbey. It detailed an &quot;extensive threat to the south half of the estate&quot;, affecting exposed footings, masonry and land surface.

==In popular culture==
Walter Scott chose the name &quot;Waverley&quot; for the hero of his novel &quot;Waverley&quot;. He did not himself say that this name was connected with Waverley Abbey, but Leslie Stephen, writing in the 1897 Dictionary of National Biography, stated &quot;The name was probably suggested by Waverley Abbey, near Farnham, which was within a ride of Ellis&#x27;s house where he had been recently staying.&quot;

Waverley Abbey was featured in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s classical romance, &quot;Sir Nigel&quot;. It was the scene of his winning of his war horse, Pommers, and his youthful conflict with the abbey authorities.

===Use as a film set===
The abbey ruins have been used as a location in the filming of a number of films and television dramas:

* &quot;Invasion&quot; (2001, miniseries)
* &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002)
* &quot;&quot; (2007, about Elizabeth I of England)
* &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007)
* &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; : &quot;Nemesis&quot; (2007, TV drama)
* &quot;Animal Soup&quot; (2009, video)
* &quot;Creation&quot; (2009, film about Charles Darwin)
* &quot;Night School: the Web Series&quot; (2014, web series)
* &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014, film)
* &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot; (2016, film)
* &quot;The Mummy&quot; (2017, film)
* &quot;Howards End&quot; (2017 television drama)
* &quot;Cursed&quot; (2020, TV series)

<text>County Seat was an American clothing retailer founded in 1973. With more than 740 stores at its peak, the chain closed in 1999 following Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

==History==
Jack J. Crocker, then the CEO of SuperValu supermarkets, founded the chain in 1973 in Dallas, Texas. Appropriate for the pun in its name, County Seat specialized in blue jeans and other casual wear. 

In 1977, the chain grew to 183 stores, and also began to sell sports clothing. 

In 1983, it was sold to the Carson Pirie Scott department store chain of Chicago, who bought County Seat for $71 million (~$ in ). Two years later, Carson Pirie Scott acquired the 19-store Pants Corral store from Giant Food of Landover, Maryland, and converted these to County Seat.

Carson Pirie Scott redesigned the chain&#x27;s stores with matte black fixtures and re-focused the merchandise line to target high schoolers. The chain had 415 stores in 1989, at which point Bergner&#x27;s acquired Carson Pirie Scott and sold County Seat to a new management team.

Wet Seal offered to buy 508 stores of the County Seat chain in 1996, but was rejected. The chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 1996 and began to close stores. County Seat filed for bankruptcy again in 1999.

<text>Track 5 is an Australian urban music act based in Melbourne, Australia.

==Band history==
Track 5 was formed in 2001 by Krishool, Adam Lovell or Adz, Paul Vercoe or Verx, Matthew De&#x27;Ath or Matty D &amp; John Vitale or JV. Krishool was born in Ghana and joined the Australian Boys Choir after his family moved to Australia - he also auditioned for Popstars but was unsuccessful. Adam Lovell was born in Brisbane and comes from a background in circus and theater while Paul Vercoe was born in rural Victoria and has classical training in piano and choirs. While the band originally had five members, the other two members of the band Matthew &amp; John didn&#x27;t stay around long due to personal music differences but would still pursue their passion of music by staying in the field. Matthew De&#x27;Ath composes lyrics &amp; music for other Australian artists &amp; bands while John Vitale pursued his love of dance by joining the Australian Ballet.

Track 5 built up their reputation through live performances around Australia. They won a Philips Five Minutes competition in 2002 and recorded a track &quot;Not the One&quot; which didn&#x27;t chart. They signed with Depac Music in early 2004. Producers Paul Carmody and Steuart De Hoedt produced their debut single on that label &quot;Crazy&quot;. Released in June 2004, it made the top 50 of the Australian singles charts in July 2004.

In 2005 to raise money for a trip to Berlin&#x27;s PopKomm festival they put themselves on EBay, getting no takers for their self-priced starting bid.

<doc id="801939" wikidata="Q1610219" url="?curid=801939" title="Hermaeus">
<text>Hermaeus Soter (, &quot;Hermaîos ho Sōtḗr,&quot; meaning &quot;Hermaeus the Saviour&quot;) was a Western Indo-Greek king of the Eucratid dynasty, who ruled the territory of Paropamisadae in the Hindu-Kush region, with his capital in Alexandria of the Caucasus (near today&#x27;s Kabul, Afghanistan). Bopearachchi dates Hermaeus to –70 BCE and R. C. Senior to –80 BCE.

==Biography==

Hermaeus&#x27; name means &quot;devoted to Hermes&quot;, and he seems to have been the successor of Philoxenus or Diomedes, and his wife Kalliope () may have been a daughter of Philoxenus, according to Senior. Judging from his coins, Hermaeus&#x27; rule was long and prosperous, but came to an end when the Yuezhi, coming from neighbouring Bactria, overran most of his Greek kingdom in the Paropamisade around 70 BCE. According to Bopearachchi, these nomads were the Yuezhi, the ancestors of the Kushans, whereas Senior considers them Sakas.

Kushan ruler Kujula Kadphises associated himself to Hermaeus on his coins, either in attempt to solidify legitimacy or due to the difficulties minting early coins. In any case, the Yuezhi-Kushans preserved a close cultural interaction with the Greeks as late as the 3rd century CE.

Given the importance of Hermaeus to the nomad rulers, it is possible that Hermaeus himself was partially of nomad origin.

==Coins of Hermaeus==

Hermaeus issued Indian silver coins of three types. The first type has a diademed or sometimes helmeted portrait, with reverse of sitting Zeus making benediction gesture. Hermaeus also issued a rare series of Attic silver tetradrachms of this type, which were issued for export to Bactria.

The second type was a joint series of Hermaeus with his queen Kalliope. The reverse departs from the traditional Hermaeus format, in that it shows the king on a prancing horse. The &quot;king on a prancing horse&quot; is characteristic of the contemporary Greek kings in the eastern Punjab such as Hippostratos, and it has been suggested that the coin represented a marital alliance between the two dynastic lines. The horseman on Hermaeus&#x27; version is however portrayed somewhat different, being equipped with a typical Scythian longbow.

The third series combined the reverses of the first series, without portrait.

Hermaeus also issued bronze coins with the head of Zeus-Mithras and a prancing horse on the reverse.

==Contacts with China==
A Chinese historical record from the Hanshu Chap. 96A could possible be related to Hermaeus, even though this is very speculative and the record more likely refers to later Saka kings. The chronicle tells how a king who may possibly be identified as Hermaeus received the support of the Chinese against Indo-Scythian occupants, and may explain why his kingdom was suddenly so prosperous despite the general decline of the Indo-Greeks during the period. The Chinese records would put Hermaeus&#x27;s dates later, with his reign ending around 40 BCE.

According to the Hanshu, Chap. 96A, Wutoulao (Spalirises?), king of Jibin (Kophen, upper Kabul Valley), killed some Chinese envoys. After the death of the king, his son (Spaladagames) sent an envoy to China with gifts. The Chinese general Wen Zhong, commander of the border area in western Gansu, accompanied the escort back. Wutoulao&#x27;s son plotted to kill Wen Zhong. When Wen Zhong discovered the plot, he allied himself with Yinmofu (Hermaeus?), &quot;son of the king of Rongqu&quot; (Yonaka, the Greeks). They attacked Jibin (possibly with the support of the Yuezhi, themselves allies of the Chinese since around 100 BCE according to the Hanshu) and killed Wutoulao&#x27;s son. Yinmofu (Hermaeus?) was then installed as king of Jibin, as a vassal of the Chinese Empire, and receiving the Chinese seal and ribbon of investiture.

Later Yinmofu (Hermaeus?) himself is recorded to have killed Chinese envoys in the reign of Emperor Yuandi (48–33 BCE), then sent envoys to apologize to the Chinese court, but he was disregarded. During the reign of Emperor Chengdi (51–7 BCE) other envoys were sent, but they were rejected as simple traders.

==Imitations by Indo-Scythian and Yuezhi invaders==
These events may have initiated an alliance between the Greeks and the Yuezhi (even possibly a dynastic alliance), explaining why the Yuezhi gained pre-eminence after the reign of Hermaeus. However the Yuezhi invaders imitated Hermaeus&#x27; coinage style possibly after taking over his kingdom, thereby depicting themselves as his successors. The early Kushan ruler Heraios even imitated Hermaeus&#x27; name on his coins but misspelled it by leaving out the letter &#x27;M&#x27;. Therefore the name Heraios is a corrupted version of Hermaios. The first true Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises associated himself with Hermaeus on his coins, but it is also possible that this ruler was identical to the aforementioned Heraios.

<text>Mallacoota is a town in the East Gippsland region in the state of Victoria, Australia. At the 2021 census, Mallacoota had a population of 1,183. It is the last official township on Victoria&#x27;s east coast before the border with New South Wales. Mallacoota has a regional airport (Mallacoota Airport) YMCO (XMC) consisting of a gravel runway for light planes and an asphalt runway for commercial planes flying from Melbourne.

It is a popular holiday spot for boating, fishing, walking the wilderness coast, swimming, birdwatching, and surfing. The Mallacoota Arts Council runs events throughout each year. Mallacoota Inlet is one of the main villages along the wilderness coastal walk from New South Wales to Victoria, and Gipsy Point is located at the head of the inlet.

==History==
Prehistory the area was part of the territory of the Bidawal people. Shore-based whaling may have taken place in the area in 1841 under the direction of Captain John Stevenson.

Settlers started to arrive in the 1830s. A small timber lighthouse was installed on nearby Gabo Island in 1854, and the existing granite lighthouse was completed in 1862. By the 1880s commercial fishing was well established, with some catch being shipped south to Melbourne. At the same time the first tourists started to arrive. Gold was discovered in 1894, after which the Spotted Dog Mine operated for three years. Mallacoota Post Office opened on 7 May 1894 and Mallacoota West in 1901. In 1928 Mallacoota West was renamed Mallacoota, and Mallacoota became Mallacoota East (closing in 1940). A satellite airfield was constructed during World War II for the purpose of coastal defence. During the 20th century the logging, farming and fishing industries in the area declined, and the tourism and abalone industries grew. The town&#x27;s largest employer, the abalone co-operative, was formed in 1967.

In December 2019, fires in the East Gippsland region had a &quot;significant impact&quot; on Mallacoota and the nearby town of Genoa.

==Geography==
Mallacoota is one of the most isolated towns in the state of Victoria, off the Princes Highway and and six hours from Melbourne. It is and seven hours from Sydney, New South Wales. It is halfway between Melbourne and Sydney when travelling via Princes Highway, though the Princess is a longer route between Australia&#x27;s two main cities compared to the Hume Highway.
It is known for its wild flowers, abalone industry, the inlet estuary consisting of Top Lake and Bottom Lake, and Croajingolong National Park that surround it.

Gipsy Point is located at the head of Mallacoota Inlet, and is especially known for its bird life.

==Sport==
Golfers play at the course of the Mallacoota Golf and Country Club on Nelson Drive.

The Sydney Swans&#x27; 2005 premiership winning defender and former St Kilda player Sean Dempster hails from Mallacoota.

Mallacoota has a soccer club called the Mallacoota Blues. The club ranging from junior age groups to senior age groups plays in the Far South Coast Football Association (FSCFA). Mallacoota is also the host to the annual Mallacoota Cup soccer tournament.

Whale watchings for migrating and residential species such as the endemic, endangered Burrunan dolphins, southern right whales, and humpback whales, are available on many locations along the coasts in their migration seasons.

Fishing competitions are also popular in the town of Mallacoota with many being held on weekends throughout the year. These weekends help to support individual businesses with the number of people that visit the small town.

==2019-2020 bushfires==

===Cause===
On the late afternoon of 28 December, a lightning strike near Wingan River started a bushfire which burned southward towards the coast, roughly 40 km away despite mild conditions and little wind. Expected wind changes and catastrophic fire conditions predicted for the days to follow highlighted the risk to the township if the fire remained uncontrolled.

===Warnings===
Evacuation warnings were given to the potential fire impact area of East Gippsland at 3:00pm on 28 December resulting in over 30,000 holidaymakers exiting the East Gippsland region in the days to follow. Mallacoota and Cann River were excluded at that time from the warnings. Three Country Fire Authority (CFA) strike teams, about 95 volunteer firefighters with 18 tankers and three command vehicles, were sent to the town immediately after the fire started on 28 December to assist the local CFA brigade and other emergency services, they arrived in the town early night the same day. Local emergency services estimated 10,000 people were in the town at the time the CFA strike teams arrived, including up to 2,000 residents. At 1:00pm on 29 December a &quot;watch and act&quot; notified residents it was too late to leave, stranding thousands in town after the Princes Highway to Melbourne was closed. This was despite roads to New South Wales being safe to travel. At 8:34pm on 29 December the roads to Melbourne were reopened but the emergency warnings continued to advise people in the township it was safest to stay. The official emergency warning advice remained that it was safest to remain in Mallacoota despite all exits being available as there was a reasonable estimate of roads, mainly the one towards Melbourne, being impacted if the predicted conditions developed suddenly. On 30 December at 11:00am, local authorities alerted residents and visitors of the fire-front and shelter plans during an announced makeshift township meeting, not everyone in town chose to attend the meeting despite it being widely announced. The general advice through the meeting was that those wanting to leave could do so, but only via the North to Eden and Canberra, this still deterred many of the residents and visitors that attended the meeting from evacuating. The roads were officially closed two hours after the meeting and the estimate was of 1,000 residents and 3,000 visitors still in the township for the remainder of the incident.

===Impact===
A southwest wind change pushed the fire through the Croajingolong National Park towards the town, roughly 60 km from the point of ignition within a few hours during the early hours of 31 December as a control line could not be established by Fire Management Victoria due to rough terrain and aircraft suppression was also unsuccessful the previous two days. An emergency warning was given at 4:40pm on 30 December for all to relocate to a safe evacuation location. This was the local hall or the wharf. Many boat owners launched their boats into the water and sheltered on the lake. It is reported that more than 50 boat owners with up to 300 people were on the lake on the evening of 30 December. The town was evacuated towards the main wharf, and into the hall, directly east of Mallacoota Airport and stayed there for over 24 hours. Aircraft suppression could not be committed on 31 December as the fire created its own weather system and thermal imaging of the fire could not be obtained accurately due to the thick layered smoke plume generated by the fire which turned day into night during the morning of that day at the location. At approximately 8:00am on 31 December a firestorm reached the industrial area of the township with the fire-front itself estimated to have been around 10 km wide, to which the CFA responded. Large sections of the town were lost during the hours that followed (mainly in Genoa Road and Terra Nova Drive) with over 135 homes destroyed and many others damaged, but the central areas of the town where people were sheltering and most of the town&#x27;s significant infrastructure was saved from the fire-front which passed and continued its path North North East towards the border with New South Wales. The CFA and other emergency services personnel continued to work well into the morning of 1 January. No human fatalities were recorded.

===Post fires===
Despite the immediate threat passing, the fires continued to burn in and around the town. In the late afternoon of 31 December people started to leave their shelters and return to their houses. Many areas of the town were cut off from direct access due to active fires, including Mirrabooka Road and Lakeside Drive. In the early hours of the morning of 1 January thick smoke engulfed the town resulting in a panicked community seeking medical assistance and evacuation. This resulted in over 200 medical presentations to the Medical Centre in a single day and stores of Ventolin inhalers being depleted with the local pharmacy supplies being exhausted before the arrival of the fires.
The CFA strike teams (personnel only) were extracted by air around mid-day on 1 January as fresh replacements could safely be deployed at “shift-change”.

===Evacuation===
On 2 January the Royal Australian Navy arrived in Mallacoota bringing a small supply of essential medical supplies and 8000 litres of diesel fuel. On 3 January it commenced the large civil evacuation due to hundreds of kilometres of the damaged road preventing access to Mallacoota and surrounding towns. Nearly 1000 people and pets were evacuated on HMAS &quot;Choules&quot; with a 20-hour trip to Hastings. There was far fewer than the initially estimated numbers, with as few as 3,000 people in the region at the time the fires hit. A further 450 people were evacuated by the Royal Australian Air Force once visibility allowed for air evacuation.

On 5 January the fires threatening Mallacoota were feared to have joined up with the Batemans Bay fires and were threatening the town of Eden, New South Wales.

===Recovery===
Roads for residents opened on the 18 January to allow them to cross the border to New South Wales to buy supplies. The Australia Day weekend provided an opportunity for campers and visitors to return in convoys to collect their belongings, but were required to leave immediately. By 6 February all roads into Mallacoota were opened.

==Climate==

Mallacoota has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to Köppen system. Unusually warm winter temperatures can be caused by the foehn effect, which typically occurs on the region&#x27;s coastal plains.

<text>The Enabling Act of 1802 was passed on April 30, 1802 by the Seventh Congress of the United States. This act authorized the residents of the eastern portion of the Northwest Territory to form the state of Ohio and join the U.S. on an equal footing with the other states. To accomplish this, and in doing so, the act also established the precedent and procedures for creation of future states in the western territories. The Enabling Act of 1802 would be the first appropriation by Congress for internal improvements in the country&#x27;s interior.

Ohio was the first state to be created out of the Northwest Territory, which had been established by the Northwest Ordinance on July 13, 1787 in an act of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. The Northwest Ordinance laid out the conditions for the development and creation of states from the territory. With the act of May 7, 1800, the eastern part of the Northwest Territory, Ohio was set off under a distinct territorial government, and the remainder was organized as the territory of Indiana. By 1802 Ohio, in the eastern division of the Northwest Territory, had reached a population of 60,000 and was entitled to begin the transition to statehood. The Enabling Act of 1802 set forth the legal mechanisms and authorized the people of Ohio to begin this process.

The act required the people of Ohio to elect a delegate for each 1,200 people to attend a constitutional convention. These delegates would meet in Chillicothe on November 1, 1802, and would decide by majority vote whether or not to form a constitution and state government, and, if so, either provide for the election of representatives for a constitutional convention or to proceed immediately with the matter.

The new constitution and government of Ohio was required only to be &quot;republican, and not repugnant to the ordinance of the thirteenth of July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, between the original States and the people and States of the territory northwest of the river Ohio&quot;. The new state was to be equal in status to the existing states, and would have only one Representative to the United States House of Representatives until the next census. To help provide that equal status, section seven of the act offered three &quot;propositions&quot; to the convention for their free acceptance or rejection, which, if accepted, would be obligatory upon the United States; these granted certain lands held by the Federal government to the new state, notably those set aside for public schools, and provided that 5% of the proceeds from sale of Federal lands would fund creations of roads to and through Ohio.

The convention met from November 1 to 29; it agreed to form a state, accepted the several land-use proposals, and wrote the Ohio Constitution of 1802, which went into force without submission to popular vote. On February 19, 1803 Congress passed an act &quot;providing for the execution of the laws of the United States in the State of Ohio&quot; (Sess. 2, ch. 7, ). This act did not purport to admit the state, but declared that Ohio, by the formation of its constitution in pursuance of the act of April 30, 1802, &quot;has become one of the United States of America.&quot; Neither act, however, set a formal date of statehood. An official statehood date for Ohio was not set until 1953, when the 83rd Congress passed a Joint resolution &quot;for admitting the State of Ohio into the Union&quot;, () which designated March 1, 1803, as that date.

==Significance and growth==
Along with the extensively discussed topic of internal improvements, the entry of Ohio into the Union in 1803 raised the issue of whether the United States or Ohio should control the public lands in the territory. In a major precedent, the older states retained for the Union full sovereignty over these lands but agreed to allocate five percent of the net proceeds of land sales in Ohio for building roads to and through the state. The Enabling Act of 1802 specifically stated that the five-percent portion should,

be applied to the laying out and making public roads, leading from the navigable waters emptying into the Atlantic, to the Ohio, to the said State, and through the same, such roads to be laid out under the authority of Congress, with the consent of the several States through which the road shall pass.

This statement within the Enabling Act of 1802 foreshadowed the Cumberland Road, which was built to fulfill the promise to use a portion of the money accruing from the sale of public lands in Ohio in order to connect that young state with Atlantic waters; the road would be approved in 1806 and would later extend nearly to the Mississippi River.

In the act of March 3, 1803, which added and modified the propositions contained in the Enabling Act, 3 percent of the net proceeds of land sales was given to Ohio for roads within the State, and for no other purpose whatever.

Similar provisions for a grant of 5 percent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands within each State have been made in the subsequent acts for the admission of the various public-land states to the Union. In the different acts there is some variation in the purposes for which the grants were made. The early acts usually made the appropriation for roads and canals; acts after 1836 made the proceeds available for roads and internal improvements; and the act for Nevada (1864) applied it to roads and irrigation ditches. Beginning with the four States admitted in 1889, the proceeds of this 5 per cent grant have been granted as a permanent fund for the support of common schools. Between 1802 and 1860, inclusive, this method of revenue sharing returned $5.4million to the states; by 1887 the amounts accruing to the various States for the proceeds of the cash sales of public lands aggregated $7.1million.

<text>Radomiak Spółka Akcyjna (&quot;Radomiak S.A.&quot;), commonly known as Radomiak Radom, is a Polish football club based in Radom, Poland. The club was founded in 1910 and competes in Ekstraklasa, the top level of Polish football. They play their home matches at the Stadion im. Braci Czachorów.

==History==
In 1910, the Russian rulers of Poland gave permission to establish the &quot;Radomskie Towarzystwo Sportowe&quot; ( &#x27;The Sporting Fellowship of Radom&#x27;, or &quot;&#x27;Radom Sports Association&#x27;). The newly formed RTS consisted of five sections, namely football, cycling, tennis, ice skating, and gymnastics. In 1911, the footballers of RKS played their first match – a 5–2 defeat to Stella Warsaw.

In 1924, the Radom Sports Association won promotion to Warsaw Class B, which was the second tier of the Polish football system at the time (the Ekstraklasa was not established until 1927). In 1925 they won promotion to Warsaw Class A, and in 1928 all teams from Radom were moved to the Kielce League, which included the cities of Radom, Kielce, Częstochowa and the Zagłębie Dąbrowskie region. The team won promotion to the Kielce League (Class A), beating Hakoah Będzin and KS Sosnowiec. After winning the Kielce League, Radom played in the play-offs for the Ekstraklasa, where they were defeated by both and Naprzód Lipiny.

For the rest of the 1930s, Radom was one of the best teams in the league, but failed to qualify for the highest level of Polish football. During the Second World War, the team ceased to exist and returned in April 1945 in a match against Czarni Radom. In 1947, after winning the regional games, Radom again played in the Ekstraklasa play-offs and lost to Widzew Łódź. Meanwhile, in April 1945, the Sports Club Bata was founded in Radom. This name remained in use until July 1945, when the team was renamed the Radomiak Sports Club. The new team won the regional games and also the Warsaw championship after beating Polonia Warsaw.

In 1946, Radomiak played in the regional play-offs for the 1946 Polish Championship. They defeated KS Lublinianka 5–0 and eventually lost 3–1 to ŁKS Łódź in the final. On 19 July 1947, Marian Czachor became the first player from Radom to make appearance for Poland, in a match against Romania.
In 1948, Radomiak entered the newly formed second division and remained there until 1952. For several years, Radomiak played in the third and fourth divisions. In 1967, Radomiak merged with the Radom Sports Association, and a new organization, the Radom Sports Club Radomiak, was founded. In 1969, the team won promotion to the second division, but was quickly relegated. Radomiak returned to the second division in 1974, but was again immediately relegated.

In 1977, Radomiak was again promoted to the second division. This time, the team from Radom stayed there for several years. In the 1982–83 season, they finished in second place after Motor Lublin. Before the 1983–84 season, Radomiak was considered one of the favorites, and the team proved their class, gaining promotion on 20 June 1984 after beating Hutnik Warsaw 2–1.

In their first, historic match in the Ekstraklasa, Radomiak defeated Bałtyk Gdynia 3–0 at home. After the autumn part of the season, Radomiak was in fifth place, seven points behind the league leaders Legia Warsaw. The spring part of the 1984–85 Ekstraklasa turned out to be a disappointment, as Radomiak kept losing, and was relegated together with Wisła Kraków. In 1989, Radomiak was relegated to the third division, and returned to the second level in June 1993. With Rafał Siadaczka as their top player, the team from Radom finished the 1993–94 season in fourth place. The next season, however, they were relegated again.

In 2003–04, Radomiak finished second in the third division. They earned promotion to the second tier after defeating Tłoki Gorzyce in the promotion play-offs. In 2004–05, Radomiak avoided relegation after once again beating Tłoki Gorzyce, this time in the relegation play-offs. The next year, however, Radomiak lost the play-offs to Odra Opole and were relegated back to the third level.

In 2020–21, Radomiak won the second division and earned promotion to the Ekstraklasa for the first time in 36 years.

==Personnel==
* Simon Steadman (lead vocals and guitar)
* Russel Field (drums and vocals)
* David Walton (bass)
* Paul Phillips (guitar)

==History==

Influenced by the Britpop-bands Oasis and Radiohead, Steadman were also compared to The Verve.

When Elektra Records dissolved, the band lost their recording deal as a result.

The band has played shows with acts including Jason Mraz, Jet, Ash, Ian McCulloch of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Feeder, Michelle Branch and Stereolab.

<text>Howard Dietz (September 8, 1896 – July 30, 1983) was an American publicist, lyricist, and librettist, best remembered for his songwriting collaboration with Arthur Schwartz. According to historian Stanley Green, Dietz and Schwartz were &quot;most closely identified with the revue form of musical theatre.&quot;
==Biography==
Dietz was born in New York City. He attended Columbia College and then studied journalism at Columbia University. He also served as publicist/director of advertising for Goldwyn Pictures and later MGM and is often credited with creating Leo the Lion, its lion mascot, and choosing their slogan &quot;Ars Gratia Artis&quot;. In 1942, he was made MGM&#x27;s Vice President in Charge of Publicity. He held that position until his retirement in 1957.

He began a long association with composer Arthur Schwartz, when they teamed up for the Broadway revue &quot;The Little Show&quot; in 1929. They would continue to work on and off over the next 30 or so years. Dietz served in the US Navy in World War I and became editor of their magazine, &quot;Navy Life&quot;. During World War II, he assisted the U.S. Treasury Department with the publicity and promotion of War Bonds, and created stage shows for the Coast Guard with composer Vernon Duke.

Dietz saved copies of every document relating to his career, as well as relating to the publicity campaigns of every MGM film he publicized. After his death, this vast trove of artifacts was donated to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The archive on Dietz constitutes its single largest archive on any person or subject.

In 1972, Howard Dietz was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. And, in 1981, he was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Dietz was married three times. He married Elizabeth Bigelow Hall in 1917. They divorced in 1936. In 1930, the couple had bought a townhouse on 18 West 11th Street in Greenwich Village from stockbroker Charles E. Merrill, founder of Merrill Lynch. The townhouse was later bought by advertising executive James Platt Wilkerson, whose daughter Cathlyn Platt Wilkerson was a member of the far-left terrorist organization Weather Underground; Wilkerson&#x27;s associates were assembling a bomb in the basement in 1970 when it exploded and destroyed the townhouse.

Dietz married Tanis Guinness Montagu on January 25, 1937, and had a daughter; they divorced 14 years later, in 1951. Later that year, he married the costume designer Lucinda Ballard. He died in July 1983, in New York City of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, from which he had suffered from 1954.

<text>Calvin Smith (born January 8, 1961) is a former sprint track and field athlete from the United States. He is a former world record holder in the 100-meter sprint with 9.93 seconds in 1983 and was twice world champion over 200 metres, in 1983 and 1987. He became Olympic champion in the 4x100-meter relay in 1984. He was born in Bolton, Mississippi.

== Background ==

Smith was brought up in Bolton, Mississippi, and attended Sumner Hill High School in Clinton, Mississippi.

Smith had a dazzling collegiate career at the University of Alabama. Smith set the 100 metre world record on July 3, 1983 at the U.S. Olympic Festival at Colorado Springs, with a run of 9.93 seconds. In doing so, he broke the previous record set by Jim Hines, which had lasted for almost 15 years. Both Hines&#x27; and Smith&#x27;s records were set at high altitude.

At the inaugural Athletics World Championships in 1983, Smith claimed gold medals in the 200 m and the 4x100-meters relay (which the U.S. team won in world record time), as well as a silver medal behind Carl Lewis in the 100 meters.

August 1983 also saw Smith become the first athlete to run under 10 seconds (9.97) for the 100 m and under 20 seconds (19.99) for the 200 meters in the same evening in Zürich, Switzerland.

At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Smith became champion as part of the U.S. 4x100-meters relay team, again establishing a new world record in this event.

At the 1987 World Championships, Smith successfully defended his 200-meter title. (At that time, the World Championships were held once every four years, whereas since 1991 they are held every two years.)

At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Smith was involved in the most controversial Olympic 100 meters final of all time and ended up in third position (after the initial winner, Ben Johnson, was disqualified: SEE below).

Smith missed out on what seemed like a likely win in the 4x100-meters relay in Seoul because the U.S. team did not reach the final following a disqualification for passing the baton outside the legal area.

Smith continued to run for the U.S. national team into the 1990s. In the later years of his career, he was named captain of the U.S. track and field team at major events including the Olympic Games and World Championships.

===1988 Olympics===
Ben Johnson of Canada crossed the line first, with Lewis second, Linford Christie of Great Britain third, and Smith fourth. When Johnson tested positive for anabolic steroids and was stripped of his title, Smith was upgraded to third position. Johnson was not the only participant whose success was questioned: Lewis had tested positive at the Olympic Trials for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;Ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.

The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot;

Christie was found to have metabolites of pseudoephedrine in his urine after a 200m heat at the same Olympics, but was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Of the finalists, only Smith and sixth-placed Robson da Silva never failed a drug test during their careers. Smith later said: &quot;I should have been the gold medalist.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Smith is married to Melanie, whom he met at college, and has two children, a daughter Brittney and a son Calvin Smith Jr.

Smith retired from athletics in 1996 and was then for two years an assistant coach at the University of Alabama. He then moved with his family to Tampa, Florida where he has pursued a variety of careers. He is currently working for a non-profit agency that provides people with medical assistance.

==International competitions==
===Personal bests===
Smith&#x27;s 19.99 run, made him the second man in history to achieve both a sub-10 second 100 m and a sub-20 second 200 m. Carl Lewis having achieved the feat 66 days earlier.

==Rankings==

Smith was ranked among the best in the USA and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events from 1980 to 1993, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.


==Records and World Bests ==
Smith achieved the following world records and world best times during his illustrious career:

* world record of 9.93 s at the United States Air Force Academy on 3 July 1983.
* world low-altitude best time of 9.97 s in Zürich on 24 August 1983.
* world record at the 4 × 100 m relay in Helsinki on 10 August 1983.
* world record in the 4 × 100 m relay in Los Angeles on 11 August 1984.

===Track records===

As of September 2024, Smith holds the following track records for 100 metres.

==Accolades==
In 2007, Smith was inducted into the United States Track and Field Hall of Fame.

In 2014, Smith was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2016, Smith was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>The sheet bend (also known as weaver&#x27;s knot and weaver&#x27;s hitch) is a bend knot. It is practical for joining lines of different diameter or rigidity. 

It is quick and easy to tie, and is considered so essential it is the first knot given in the &quot;Ashley Book of Knots&quot;. Additionally, it is one of the six knots given in the International Guild of Knot Tyers&#x27; Six Knot Challenge, along with the clove hitch, bowline, reef knot (square knot), round turn and two half-hitches, and sheepshank. 

The sheet bend is related in structure to the bowline; like the bowline, it has a tendency to work loose when not under load. For increased security, it is sometimes recommended that one add another turn in the smaller end, making a double sheet bend; in most cases, however, a single sheet bend should suffice. The becket hitch is another structurally similar knot.

As a bend, its advantages lie in its simplicity and non-jamming properties. 

It is commonly taught in Scouting.

==Definition==
The term &quot;sheet bend&quot; derives from its use bending ropes to sails (sheets). It is mentioned in David Steel&#x27;s 1794 book &quot;Elements and Practice of Rigging and Seamanship&quot; but was used by Neolithic peoples for tying the meshes of fishing nets. The name &quot;weaver&#x27;s knot&quot; comes from its historic use in textile mills. Even in modern operations, weavers are taught to use this particular knot when correcting broken threads in the warp. 

==Method==
The sheet bend may be tied by various methods: the basic &quot;rabbit through the hole&quot; method of forming a half hitch in the bight of the larger rope, by a more expedient method shown in Ashley as ABoK #1431 (similar to the method used by an experienced sailor or mountaineer to tie a bowline) or by a trick method (ABoK#2562), involving upsetting a noose knot over a short end of the &quot;larger&quot; rope. Lines of equal size may be joined with a sheet bend, but when one is larger, it plays the simpler role of the &quot;eye&quot; (red line shown in the infobox), rather than the half-hitch (in green)

One type of weaver&#x27;s knot is topologically equivalent to a sheet bend, but is tied (usually in smaller stuff) with a different approach. Sheet bends are also used for netting.

The Ashley Book of Knots states that a left-hand sheet bend (where the two free ends are on opposite sides of the knot) is inferior to the regular sheet bend.
More recent testing on the left-hand bowline has shown that there is little difference in strength between it and the regular bowline,
so it could also be said that there is little difference in strength between the left-hand sheet bend and regular sheet bend.
==Double sheet bend==
When lines are of unequal diameter or rigidity it is necessary for security to &quot;double&quot; the sheet bend by making an additional round turn below the first and again bringing the working end back under itself. The free ends should end up on the same side of the knot for maximum strength.
==Security==
A study of 8 different bends using climbing rope of equal diameter said the sheet bend was weak. In one test, it pulled apart with less than half the tension that other knots withstood. The authors recommend &quot;2 half hitches on the bend back line and overhand knot on turn thru line.&quot; Even with these, it was always a bottom performer and the double sheet bend did little better. However, the butterfly bend did the best.

After performing security testing, Ashley wrote with regard to the Sheet Bend: &quot;Some readers may be surprised to find the Sheet Bend with so low a rating, but these tests were made in exceptionally slippery material. The Sheet Bend is the most practical of bends and quite secure enough for ordinary purposes.&quot;

<text>George Phillips Bond (May 20, 1825February 17, 1865) was an American astronomer. He was the son of William Cranch Bond. Some sources give his year of birth as 1826.

His early interest was in nature and birds, but after his elder brother William Cranch Bond Jr. died, he felt obliged to follow his father into the field of astronomy. He succeeded his father as director of Harvard College Observatory from 1859 until his death. His cousin was Edward Singleton Holden, first director of Lick Observatory.

Bond took the first photograph of a star in 1850 (Vega) and of a double star in 1857 (Mizar); suggested photography could be used to measure a star&#x27;s magnitude; and discovered numerous comets (including C/1850 Q1) and calculated their orbits. Bond also studied Saturn and the Orion Nebula. He and his father jointly discovered Saturn&#x27;s moon, Hyperion (which was also independently discovered by William Lassell). In addition to his astronomical contributions, Bond also surveyed the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

He died of tuberculosis.

<text>James Robert Horner (born August 6, 1957) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and first baseman who played ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily with the Atlanta Braves.

After a record-setting NCAA College athletic career with the Arizona State Sun Devils baseball team, Horner bypassed the minor leagues and moved directly to the major leagues where together with Dale Murphy, he formed a power-hitting tandem for the Atlanta Braves teams of the early 1980s. Known for his powerful hitting, Horner averaged 35 home runs and 109 runs batted per his 162-game average and became the 11th player in Major League Baseball history to hit four home runs in one game on July 6, . He was named the 1978 National League (NL) Rookie of the Year and was a member of the 1982 National League All-Star team.

Horner became a victim of the Major League Baseball collusion scandal of 1986–87 after the courts found that owners had illegally shared information during free agency negotiations seeking to deflate player salaries. He was among hundreds of players and former players who were awarded millions of dollars in lost salary. He played one season in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yakult Swallows, before returning to play one final season in MLB with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1988. A string of injuries prematurely ended Horner&#x27;s baseball career after just 11 seasons. He was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class on July 4, 2006.

==Amateur career==
Horner was born in Junction City, Kansas, but grew up in Glendale, Arizona. He attended Apollo High School, where he set school records. His college career at Arizona State University culminated with being named the first winner of the Golden Spikes Award. With his nine home runs in 1976 he is tied with Ike Davis (2006) for third all-time by a Sun Devil freshman, two behind Barry Bonds (1983).

A second baseman for TSN&#x27;s College All-America team in 1977 and 1978, Horner set a then-NCAA record of 58 career home runs for Arizona State, set a 25-homer single-season record, and was selected the MVP of 1977 College World Series.

==Professional career==
Horner was drafted by Atlanta with the first overall pick in the 1978 amateur draft, and he made his Major League Baseball debut the same year. He is one of only a handful of players to go directly from college to the starting lineup in the majors without spending a day in the minor leagues. In his first game, he belted a home run off future Hall of Fame pitcher Bert Blyleven of the Pirates. In 89 games, Horner batted .266 with 23 home runs and 63 runs batted in in 323 at-bats, with an on-base percentage of .313 and a slugging percentage of .539. His 23 home runs led all National League third basemen in 1978. He won the National League Rookie of the Year honor over Ozzie Smith.
In 1979, Horner batted .314 with 33 homers and 98 RBIs. In 1980, Horner batted .268, with 35 home runs and 89 RBIs despite being sidelined for a total of 79 games in both seasons after recurring shoulder and leg injuries. In the strike-shortened 1981 season, he hit .277 with 15 home runs and 42 RBIs in 79 games. Horner rejuvenated in 1982, finishing with 32 home runs, 97 RBIs, and an OBP of .350, while slugging .501.

In August 1983, Horner was hitting .303 with 20 homers and a career-high OBP of .383 when he fractured his right wrist while sliding, missing the last 43 games of the season. In May 1984, Horner broke his left wrist while diving after a ball and he was sidelined for the rest of the season.

In 1985, Horner played 130 games and finished with a .267 batting average, 27 home runs, and 89 RBIs. In 1986, Horner set personal highlights. On July 6, 1986, in a game against the Expos, he became the eleventh player in Major League Baseball history to hit four home runs in a single game and only the second one to do so in a game that his team lost (the first one being Ed Delahanty). Later in the season, after hitting a record 210 career home runs without a grand slam, Horner finally belted a homer with the bases loaded to give the Braves a 4–2 victory over the Pirates. Horner&#x27;s record for homers without a grand slam stood until 1998 when Sammy Sosa surpassed the mark by hitting his first grand slam on the 248th home run of his career.

Horner became a free agent in 1987, after his first season of more than 500 at-bats. Although Horner was still near his peak, the Major League clubs were then colluding to drive down salaries, so no offers were made to Horner, whose asking price was $2 million. (In 2004, Horner received more than $7 million from the successful lawsuit the players filed against the owners and their illegal collusion.) After failing to reach an agreement with an MLB club, Horner signed a $2 million, one-year contract with the Yakult Swallows of Japan&#x27;s Central League. He was given number 50 by the organization because that was the number of home runs they expected him to hit. He ended up hitting 31 homers and had 73 RBIs for the team.

Despite Yakult offering Horner a reported $10 million for a new three-year contract, Horner returned to the majors in 1988 with the St. Louis Cardinals. After 60 games, however, he injured his left shoulder. After being invited to spring training by the Baltimore Orioles in 1989, Horner announced his retirement.

In his ten-year Major League career, Horner batted .277 with 218 home runs, 685 RBIs, 560 runs, 1,047 hits, 169 doubles, 8 triples, 14 stolen bases, a .340 on-base percentage, and a .499 slugging average in 1,020 games. Defensively, in 684 games at third base, he compiled a .946 fielding percentage, and in 330 games at first base, he posted a .994 fielding percentage. Overall, his career fielding percentage was .977.

==Legacy==
On July 4, 2006, Horner was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class.

==History==

The club was founded in 1973 after the union of two clubs from Kielce – Iskra and SHL. The new club got its first promotion to the Polish 2nd league in 1975. Unfortunately, the team did not play very well and was soon relegated. The next promotion was in 1982. Korona played in the 2nd league until 1990 when it was once again relegated. 1996 brought several changes. Nida Gips from Gacki became the new sponsor and the club&#x27;s name changed to Miejski Klub Sportowy Sekcja Futbolowa Korona. During the 1998–99 season, Korona again played in the 2nd league but dropped down at the end of the season. In 2000 Korona merged with another club from Kielce – Błękitni Kielce and was renamed to Kielecki Klub Piłkarski Korona.

In 2002, the golden era for Korona had begun. Kolporter became the new sponsor, Krzysztof Klicki the new chairman, and the club&#x27;s name changed to Kielecki Klub Piłkarski Kolporter Korona. In 2003, the team was again renamed, this time to Sportowa Spólka Akcyjna Kolporter Korona. The goal was simple – to be the best Polish football team. The dream started to become reality in 2005 when Korona won the 2nd league and for the first time in the club&#x27;s history was promoted to the Polish premier league.

Korona&#x27;s first match in the Ekstraklasa was against Cracovia and the final score was 0–0. Korona ended the 2005–06 season fifth in the league table. Prior to the 2006–07 season, at a meeting with supporters, the chairman announced that club would revert to its historical coat of arms. Korona&#x27;s second season in the Ekstraklasa started off strongly with an away win against Arka Gdynia (3–0). 20 September 2006 was a significant one in Korona&#x27;s history. After an away victory against Odra Wodzisław Śląski, the club climbed to the top of the league table for the first time in its history although it ended the 2006–07 season in 7th place. Its third and final season in the top division was 2007–08, placing 6th but being relegated for its involvement in match-fixing in the 2003–04 season. In August 2008, Klicki sold the club to the city of Kielce for a nominal fee.

After one year, on 14 July 2009, Korona Kielce was promoted to the Ekstraklasa. In the 2019–20 season, Korona finished in 15th place and were relegated back to I liga. On 29 May 2022 Korona returned to the Ekstraklasa following a 3–2 win over Chrobry Głogów in the promotion play-off final after the winning goal scored in the final minutes of extra time.

==Stadium==

In response to Korona&#x27;s successes and the club owner, Krzysztof Klicki&#x27;s, affirmation that the club would play in the premier league and battle for European cups, Kielce municipal authorities approved the construction of a new stadium. Unfortunately, the stadium turned out to be much too small. Because of this the club played its first round in the highest division at its old stadium (currently used by reserves and youth teams) to permit further work on the new facility.

Only eighteen months after the start of the building project, the keys of the new stadium were officially handed to the club. The first premier league match was played on 1 April 2006 against Zagłębie Lubin.

The Korona stadium, although it stands on the same site as an earlier stadium, is an entirely new facility, built according to UEFA recommendations and modern design ideas. In this way it differs from most other football stadiums in Poland which were built during the communist era or earlier and only slightly modernized to meet basic UEFA standards.

Kielce stadium can seat 15,550 fans, however, due to Polish regulations, which require a buffer zone between local fans and the visitors section, league matches can only accommodate 13,823 Korona fans and 777 visiting fans. However, on one occasion the stadium was full to capacity during a league match. This occurred during the 2006–07 season when fans of visiting club Legia Warsaw were prohibited from entering due to the vast number of their &#x27;red brigade&#x27; supporters who made the trip down to watch their club in Kielce.

Pitch dimensions are 105 x 68 m, and the entire surface is heated. Automatic sprinklers water the pitch in between match days. Kielce stadium has a complete system of monitoring, which could serve as a model for other Polish stadiums. Korona&#x27;s stadium is also considered by the Polish Football Association for international games.

Since 2006, when the club moved to the most modern stadium in Poland, it often had one of the highest attendance statistics in the Polish league, although these numbers have declined since the club&#x27;s relegation at the end of the 2007–08 season.

==Club crest==
A new club crest was introduced in 2002, featuring a redesigned coat of arms. However, many fans were disappointed by the removal of the beloved black crown from the emblem.

Before the 2006–07 season, the chairman announced in a meeting with supporters that the club would return to the historical coat of arms. Thanks to the fans and good will of the chairman, Korona again has the crown in her coat of arms.

==Supporters==
Supporters of Korona are some of the most enthusiastic in the Ekstraklasa and have received many awards for their artistic match &#x27;frames&#x27;. In the spring round of 2006–07, Korona Kielce fans were awarded 5 times in 8 matches for their superb &#x27;frames&#x27;.

Korona supporters&#x27; tireless cheering for their team often helps their team to victories. The most faithful fans are seated in the &quot;Młyn&quot; – &quot;the Mill&quot; – which contains 500 – 2,000 people.

On 14 June 2006, the Stowarzyszenie Kibiców Korony Kielce &quot;Złocisto-Krwiści&quot; (Korona Kielce Supporters Association &quot;Golden-Blooded&quot;) was officially registered at a Kielce court. Official appointing of Korona Kielce fans had become a fact. This association brings together representatives of various Korona supporters groups.

The association is a partner for the club and many institutions, which it wants to cooperate with. The fans are invaluable in the creation of memorable football events, and the association has an important role in increasing fan input on football life in Korona. The most important role of the association however is to improve the quality of support.

The association also organizes special trains and coaches for fans for away matches. It also organizes events promoting the Club such as &quot;Golden-bloody stadium in Kielce&quot;, &quot;Small toy – children&#x27;s benefit&quot; (fans donated toys to an orphanage), &quot;Action Banner&quot; (a lot of flags and banners were sewed). In short, the association has introduced a new supporting style at Korona matches which will attract even more fans to the stadium on Ściegiennego street.

Korona Kielce fans have a friendship with fans of Stal Mielec and Sandecja Nowy Sącz.

Their biggest rivals are KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski with whom they contest the Holy Cross Province derby. Other fierce rivals are Radomiak Radom and Wisła Kraków.

==Korona Kielce II==

The club operates a reserve team.

==Season to season==
==Ownership==
Since 2020, the club is wholly owned by the city of Kielce, after it acquired the remaining shares held by the previous majority owner, former German international footballer Dieter Burdenski. In April 2017, he purchased 72% of the club shares and subsequently signed his son Fabian in June that year.

<text>Randy Snow (May 24, 1959 – November 19, 2009) was the first Paralympian to be inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame and the first paralympian to win medals in three different sports: track, basketball and tennis.

==Biography==
Thomas Randall Snow was the oldest of four children of Alison Lee McElhone, a kindergarten teacher, and Thomas Snow, a real estate attorney. He was born in Austin, Texas and later his family moved to Terrell, Texas. In 1975, at the age of 16, his spine was crushed by a 1000-pound bale of hay, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. After graduating, he enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin in 1977, where he indulged in the fraternity party life, until forming a wheelchair basketball team under the direction of Jim Hayes, the University of Texas at Arlington wheelchair sports director. Soon afterward, he began wheelchair racing, and in 1980 transferred to Arlington in order to work with Hayes, eventually establishing himself as the best wheelchair tennis player in the United States.

In 1984, the Summer Olympics added a men&#x27;s 1500-meter wheelchair race as an exhibition event. Snow went into heavy training, relocating to Houston, Texas, to train on the same track as Carl Lewis. This was the first Paralympic event to appear before a large audience, and the public was unsure of their feelings for wheelchair-using athletes. Snow received a silver medal, and the crowd gave the athletes a standing ovation at the end of the exhibition.

In the 1990–91 season, Snow won 68 consecutive matches and 15 straight tournaments, becoming the first International Tennis Federation Wheelchair World Champion. Snow went on to win gold medals in the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona for singles and doubles tennis, and at the 1996 Atlanta Games was a member of the bronze medal-winning wheelchair basketball team. He also competed in men&#x27;s wheelchair tennis singles at the 2000 Summer Paralympics but lost in the third round to eventual gold medalist David Hall of Australia.

He was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame on July 1, 2004.

Randy Snow died in El Salvador on November 19, 2009, while volunteering at a wheelchair tennis camp. He was posthumously inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, on July 14, 2012.

<doc id="802011" wikidata="Q452475" url="?curid=802011" title="Mackenzie Phillips">
<text>Mackenzie Phillips (born November 10, 1959) is an American actress. Her best-known roles include Carol Morrison in the film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, Julie Cooper Horvath on the sitcom &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, Molly Phillips on Disney Channel’s supernatural series &quot;So Weird&quot;, and Barbara &quot;Barb&quot; Denning in &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;.

== Early life ==

Phillips attended Highland Hall Waldorf School in Northridge, California. At age 12, Phillips formed a band with three of her classmates, and she was spotted by a casting agent during one of their performances. She was given an audition for a role in the 1973 film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, which she won.

== Career ==
Phillips was 12 years old during the filming of &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, and 13 when the movie was released. She was cast as Carol Morrison, a young girl accidentally picked up by hot rodding teenager John Milner (Paul Le Mat). Because of California state law, producer Gary Kurtz became Phillips&#x27;s legal guardian for the duration of the filming.

Phillips gained stardom in the 1970s playing teenager Julie Cooper (when the character got married, her married name was Horvath) on the long-running television show &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, for which she earned $50,000 (equal to $280,516.73 today) a week. During the show&#x27;s third season in 1977, Phillips was arrested for disorderly conduct. Because of her drug and alcohol abuse, Phillips began arriving late and was even incoherent for rehearsals. The producers ordered her to take a six-week break to overcome her addiction but were ultimately forced to fire her in 1980.

After two near-fatal overdoses, Phillips entered Fair Oaks Hospital voluntarily for treatment. In 1981, the producers of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; invited her back to the show. However, in 1982, Phillips relapsed into cocaine use and the following year, she collapsed on the show&#x27;s set. After refusing to take a drug test, she was fired permanently, and her character written out of the series. In 1992, Philips entered a drug rehab program for nine months.

From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, Phillips performed as a singer and toured with a re-formed version of The Mamas &amp; the Papas, known as The New Mamas and The Papas.

In 1999, Phillips co-starred with Cara DeLizia in the Disney Channel series &quot;So Weird&quot;, playing a fictional rock star named Molly Phillips. She sang original songs written by show producers Jon Cooksey and Ann Marie Montade. In 2002, she appeared in the Disney Channel original movie &quot;Double Teamed&quot;. Phillips guest-starred on episodes of &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

Phillips won an Honorary Best Actress award on March 20, 2011, at the closing night awards gala of the Female Eye Film Festival in Toronto for her performance as Sharon in the 2010 independent film &quot;Peach Plum Pear&quot;. While in Toronto, she was interviewed on &quot;Canada AM&quot;, &quot;ET Canada&quot;, and &quot;The Marilyn Denis Show&quot;.

In 2016, Phillips began working at the Breathe Life Healing Center in West Hollywood, California as a drug rehab counselor.

In 2017, Phillips appeared in an episode of the rebooted &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; as Pam Valentine. The role was apt, given Phillips&#x27;s history: she portrayed a counselor. She reprised the role in 2019, in two episodes of the third season.

In 2018, Phillips appeared as Barbara Denning in episodes of the Netflix original &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;.

==Personal life==
Phillips has been married three times: first to rock group manager Jeffrey Sessler, son of Freddie Sessler (from 1979 to 1981); then to rock guitarist Shane Fontayne (from 1986 to 2000); and then to Keith Levenson in 2005 (they subsequently divorced). She has one child, son Shane Barakan (b. 1987), a musician. In an interview in March 2022, she stated that she has dated both men and women.

===Substance abuse and arrest===
Phillips has struggled with drug abuse for much of her life. On August 27, 2008, she was arrested by the Los Angeles Airport Police on charges of possession of cocaine and heroin, discovered after she went through airport security screening. On October 31, 2008, she pled guilty to one felony count of cocaine possession and was sentenced to a drug rehabilitation program. Phillips&#x27;s drug case was dismissed after she successfully completed a drug diversion program.

She appeared on the third season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;, which aired in January and February 2010. She later discussed her recovery on the March 17, 2010, episode of &quot;The View&quot;.

===History of alleged abuse by biological father===
In September 2009, Phillips&#x27; memoir &quot;High on Arrival&quot; was released, after which she appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; for an hour-long interview. She told Winfrey that she first tried cocaine when she was 11 years old and that her father had given her drugs and injected her with cocaine. During the interview, Phillips read excerpts from her book. She said that at the age of 19, on the night before her first wedding in 1979, &quot;I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my own father,&quot; and that when she confronted her father months later, asking why he had raped her, her father simply replied, &quot;Raped you? Don&#x27;t you mean we made love?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC News 9/23/09&quot;&gt;ABC News 9/23/09&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips told Winfrey of having a &quot;consensual&quot; sexual relationship with her father, describing her participation as &quot;sort of Stockholm syndrome, where you begin to love your captor.&quot; However, she has also described the initial incident as a rape and has said, &quot;No matter what kind of incest, it is an abuse of power ... a betrayal of trust.&quot;

The alleged abuse ended after Phillips conceived a child and, worried about its parentage, subsequently had an abortion, for which her father paid.

Genevieve Waite, John Phillips&#x27; third wife, denied the allegations, saying they were inconsistent with his character. Michelle Phillips, John&#x27;s second wife, also stated that she had &quot;every reason to believe [Phillips&#x27; account is] untrue.&quot; However, Chynna Phillips, Phillips&#x27; half-sister and Michelle Phillips&#x27;s daughter, stated that she believed Phillips&#x27; claims and that Phillips first told her about the relationship during a phone conversation in 1997, approximately 11 years after the supposed relationship had ended. Jessica Woods, daughter of Denny Doherty, said that her father had told her that he knew &quot;the awful truth&quot; and that he was &quot;horrified at what John had done.&quot;

<text>The Separate Operational Purpose Division or ODON, formerly called OMSDON (a.k.a. &quot;Dzerzhinsky Division&quot;), is a rapid deployment internal security division of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR and then the Russian Federation, currently part of the National Guard Forces Command of the Russian Federation. ODON () is an initialism for Отдельная дивизия оперативного назначения (&quot;Otdel&#x27;naya diviziya operativnogo naznacheniya&quot;, ).

==USSR==
The precursor to the ODON was the 1st Automobile Fighting Detachment of the VTsIK () which was created in February 1918. The detachment was tasked with guarding the members of the VTsIK and the Sovnarkom and providing them with passenger cars. After the relocation of the government to Moscow in March 1918, it was assigned to guarding the Kremlin, along with the Red Latvian Riflemen and later the &quot;Kremlin cadets&quot; (). The detachment was renamed 1st Armored Car Detachment in 1919, and was transferred to VChK in 1921. At the peak of its strength, the detachment had over 400 troops.

In April 1921, VChK created the OSNAZ battalion which consisted of 1st Armored Car Detachment, three rifle platoons, a cavalry squadron, and various auxiliary units, with a total strength of some 1,100 men. VChK became OGPU in 1922, and the OSNAZ was renamed accordingly.

On 17 June 1924, the OSNAZ battalion, an OGPU rifle battalion and an OGPU rifle regiments formed the Special-Purpose Division (DON) of the OGPU Troops. The DON included 4 rifle regiments with an Armored Car detachment. In August 1926, the division was renamed Special-Purpose Division of the OGPU Troops. Throughout 1926, one more regiment and five more battalions joined the DON, raising its total strength to some 4,500 troops.

In 1929, the DON was reorganized as a full army division. In 1931, the Armoured Car detachment was reorganized into an armoured regiment. In 1934, OGPU was transferred to the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (the NKVD). The division fought on the front lines of the Winter War against Finland.

With the onset of World War II, parts of the division participated in the Battle of Moscow; the remaining unit guarded particularly important installations of the capital, patrolled the streets, and were involved in efforts to liquidate enemy infiltrator groups near the front and in the city.

Along with participation in hostilities, division elements in Moscow detained 485 enemy intelligence agents, 69,753 deserters, and over 320,000 offenders of the established regime.

The division took part in the 1941 October Revolution Parade on Moscow&#x27;s Red Square.

In the battle against German troops, the snipers of the 4 Cavalry Regiment (later four motorized infantry) distinguished themselves. On the first deployment of the two sniper Regiments in 1942, they killed 853 German soldiers and officers. In total, in 1942 sniper division has killed 6,440 German soldiers and officers.

The OMSDON units protected the Allied leaders during the Yalta conference.

In preparation for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, an elite group of OMSDON troops was trained with special forces tactics; the core of this group later became the Vytyaz unit. The final USSR designation of the division was OMSDON (Independent Special-Purpose Motorized Rifle Division of the Internal Troops of the MVD of the Soviet Union , ).

==Russian Federation==

In 1994, the OMSDON was renamed as the Independent Operational Purpose Division or ODON. The unit has been once again named after on October 22, 2014, returning therefore to the full title of the Independent Medals of Zhukov, Lenin and October Revolution Red Banner Operational Purpose Division of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia (). As always, they form the first line of security during important events held in Russia, and represent the Internal Troops during the yearly Moscow Victory Parade and the Moscow November 7 Anniversary Parade (the latter because they attended that very October 1941 Revolution Day parade which was the only parade held in the midst of the Great Patriotic War).

With the formation of the National Guard of Russia, the ODON was officially, in April 2016, retitled as the Independent Orders of Zhukov, Lenin and October Revolution Red Banner Operational Purpose Division of the National Guard Forces Command of the Russian Federation ().

The Division marked its Centennial in 2024.

== Composition ==

<text>The Parti pour la république du Canada (Québec) (in English: &quot;Party for the Commonwealth of Canada (Quebec)&quot;) was the Quebec branch of the Party for the Commonwealth of Canada, a Canadian political party formed by supporters of U.S. politician Lyndon LaRouche. Founded in 1983, it contested seats in the 1985, 1989 and 1994 Quebec general elections under various names: &quot;Parti républicain du Québec&quot; (Republican Party of Quebec; not to be mistaken with the Parti républicain du Québec, a sovereigntist party founded by Marcel Chaput in 1962), &quot;Parti pour le Commonwealth du Canada (Québec)&quot; and &quot;Parti pour la république du Canada (Québec)&quot;. It also contested by-elections prior to the 1985 general election.

The PRC(Q) was disbanded after the 1994 general election. It now operates as the Committee for the Republic of Canada.

<doc id="802020" wikidata="Q3490818" url="?curid=802020" title="Sophia Petrillo">
<text>Sophia Petrillo is a character from the sitcom television series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and its spin-offs &quot;The Golden Palace and&quot; &quot;Empty Nest.&quot; The character was played by the actress Estelle Getty for 10 years and 258 episodes. Getty was also the only actress from the original show to be part of the main cast in all three shows. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Blossom&quot; and an episode of &quot;Nurses&quot;.

== Chronology ==

=== Early history ===
Sophia Grisanti was born in Sicily to Don Angelo, Sr. and Eleanor Grisanti. She had two sisters, Angela and Regina, and a brother, Angelo, Jr. Although another brother was mentioned, he was unnamed and was only spoken of a few times. Dorothy mentions an &quot;Uncle Vito&quot; in Season 2, but it is unclear whether he is Sophia&#x27;s brother or the brother of her husband, Salvadore. Many of Sophia&#x27;s stories about her life in Sicily take place in 1922, including some where she details being a young woman having romantic relationships. However, when the show began in 1985 she was described as being 80, which would make her birth in 1905.

As a teenager, while living in a village in Sicily, Sophia was briefly engaged to a young man, Augustine Bagatelli. She also claims that she was once engaged to her brother - something largely dismissed as a joke in the episode. Later, she became engaged to Giuseppe Mangiacavallo, who jilted her at the altar. Sophia&#x27;s first marriage to Guido Spirelli (she was 14 and it was an arranged marriage) ended in annulment, after which, she moved to New York, which left her with no accent to show she had grown up speaking the Sicilian language. Instead, she sports a Brooklyn accent with a fast speaking pace, which often contributed to the humor in her one-liners.

Sophia later married Salvadore &quot;Sal&quot; Petrillo (played in flashbacks by Sid Melton) and had three children with him, including Dorothy, now a divorced substitute teacher; and Phil (an unseen character), a cross-dresser with a wife named Angela. He had several children and lived in a trailer park in Newark, New Jersey, and later died of a heart attack during the series. Sophia&#x27;s other daughter, Gloria (played by Doris Belack and later Dena Dietrich), lived in California and married into money but later lost her husband to an unknown cause. Sophia remained with Salvadore until his death from a heart attack. In a 1985 episode, Sophia mentions that Sal had died 30 years earlier. However, in a 1988 episode, it is stated that Sal died 27 years earlier.

=== &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1985–92) ===
In her later years, Sophia suffered a stroke--the effects of which are said to be a partial explanation for Sophia&#x27;s blunt, uncensored, and brazen remarks. She was subsequently placed in a retirement home, Shady Pines, by her daughter, Dorothy. However, after Shady Pines was damaged in a fire, Sophia moved in with Dorothy. Sophia didn&#x27;t have many good things to say about &quot;the home,&quot; alluding to poor treatment by the staff many times. Dorothy sometimes threatened to send her back there if she was &quot;behaving badly&quot;.

Whilst living in Miami, Sophia had many suitors but did not date any of them for a substantial amount of time. She did, however, remarry once more. Max Weinstock (Jack Gilford) was her late husband&#x27;s long-time business partner, and someone Sophia had long blamed for ruining the business, although it was later revealed Sal was responsible. Sophia and Max forgave each other after the latter revealed the truth, and the two quickly became close and got married. The newlyweds realized their romance would not work out and they parted ways, as friends. As divorce would have gone against her Roman Catholic beliefs, Sophia and Max never divorced.

Due to Sophia&#x27;s Sicilian descent, there were regular hints in the series that she and her family had some mafia connections. She made reference to several vendettas, and it was even hinted that Sophia &quot;herself&quot; had done mob work; she once stated that no one in her family had &quot;ever left a body to be found&quot;. Sophia also claimed to have been present at the 1929 St. Valentines Day Massacre, which she then took back, stating, &quot;Oh yeah, I was at the movies that day. &quot;All&quot; day.&quot; It was revealed that she was present at &quot;a&quot; St. Valentines Day Massacre but not &quot;the&quot; St. Valentines Day Massacre.

Sophia believed strongly in ancient Sicilian custom and traditions, and in the power of a &quot;Sicilian curse.&quot; The list of people she claims to have &quot;cursed&quot; included Shelley Long, the Baltimore Colts, the New York Jets, Giuseppe Mangiacavallo (the boy who stood her up at the altar), and Leonard Barton (the girls&#x27; next-door neighbor who expressed a disdain for Italians). She had threatened to cast a curse on Dorothy (before she found out that it was prohibited by another arcane custom), and on Stan Zbornak. In the final season, Sophia spent two episodes doing odd tasks in order to save Dorothy from an ancient curse from a Sicilian &quot;strega&quot;, or witch.

In the series finale of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Sophia, after initially deciding to follow the now-married Dorothy out of the house, turned back and decided to stay with Rose and Blanche, which set up the transition to &quot;The Golden Palace.&quot;

=== &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; (1992-93) ===
When Rose, Blanche, and Sophia invested in a hotel, Sophia was installed as one of the two chefs, specializing in Italian cuisine while the hotel&#x27;s previous chef, Chuy Castillos (Cheech Marin), handled Mexican food. Sophia began to show signs of senile dementia, usually in comical situations (for instance, she is shown to be standing still and apparently unconscious while attempting to operate a vacuum cleaner), and her bluntness was toned down to a certain extent. (In reality, Getty would later be diagnosed with Lewy body dementia herself; however, in &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, her acting and ability to remember lines had improved compared to on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, during which she had struggled to remember her lines.) In the episode &quot;One Angry Stan&quot; Sophia was the only one to witness Stanley Zbornak after he had faked his death to avoid tax troubles; the fact that no one else saw Stan in these episodes (he ducks out of sight whenever someone else enters the room), coupled with Sophia&#x27;s increased senility, made it unclear whether or not Stan was really alive, or if Sophia was hallucinating.

=== &quot;Empty Nest&quot; (Seasons 6 &amp; 7, 1993-95) ===
After the events of &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; (which ended without a series finale), Sophia returned to the Shady Pines nursing home, joining the cast of the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; spin-off, &quot;Empty Nest&quot; for its last two seasons. She had previously made a guest appearance in Season 1 and Season 4.

==Relationships and characteristics==
Sophia is best known for her wisecracks, put-downs and brazen remarks, often commenting on Dorothy&#x27;s unmarried state, Blanche&#x27;s promiscuity, and Rose&#x27;s cluelessness. However, despite her sharp criticism of her daughter and roommates, she loves and cares for them deeply; she even sees Rose and Blanche as surrogate daughters. The other women usually seek Sophia out for advice, which she is all too willing to share, usually beginning with her catchphrase, &quot;Picture it…&quot;
Like Rose&#x27;s tall tales, Sophia&#x27;s parables often end with a moral, from which advice can be gleaned. These stories usually also involved historical figures, with Sophia claiming to have had trysts with Pablo Picasso, Sigmund Freud, and Winston Churchill, among others. She also claims to have befriended many famous people including Golda Meir, Mama Celeste, and accidentally claimed that Robert Frost was always &quot;nipping at my nose&quot; (she confused him with Jack Frost).

Similarly to her daughter, Sophia is liberal in her beliefs and is suspected to be a Democrat. She supported same-sex marriage and told Dorothy that if she had a gay child she would not love them any less. In a Season 7 episode, Sophia complained about how there were no good Democratic candidates running in the Presidential election that year.

Members of Sophia&#x27;s family who appeared on the program include: Her sister, Angela (Nancy Walker for 2 episodes in Season 2); her brother, Angelo (played by Bill Dana); her father Angelo (also played by Dana), seen in a flashback; her daughter, Gloria; her husband, Sal (in flashbacks and in dream sequences); and Sophia&#x27;s own mother (played by Bea Arthur), who also appeared exclusively in a flashback; and even Dorothy at a younger age (played by Lynnie Greene).

It is unclear whether Sophia moved to the United States alone or with her family, as her sister and mother had both lived in New York as well. Sophia and her sister Angela were estranged for decades, after a misunderstanding at a Christmas party in 1955; Angela then became a widow and she moved back to Sicily for 30 years, until they reconciled and she moved back to the U.S. Sophia&#x27;s brother Angelo (initially a priest, then a layman) remained in Sicily and moved to the United States only in Season 6.

A continuity error involves Sophia&#x27;s mother. In an early episode, Sophia&#x27;s brother stated that their mother died seventy-two years earlier just as Angelo was about to become a priest (which he did not do). In a later episode, Dorothy, as a young woman, brought Sophia&#x27;s mother to visit. In an episode not long after this one, Dorothy mentioned that her grandmother (Sophia&#x27;s mother) died when Dorothy was six years old.

==Appearance==
In her younger years, Sophia apparently had always been petite with auburn hair (Getty&#x27;s natural color), but in one episode she says she was &quot;a tall voluptuous blonde with a butt like granite&quot; when she was younger (though this statement was likely a by-product of her penchant for telling tall tales). In another episode, she also stated that she and a friend both claimed to have been natural redheads in their youth. Getty portrayed the younger Sophia in occasional flashbacks, without her white wig and aging makeup.

During the series&#x27; run, Sophia resembled the archetypal &quot;old lady&quot; in looks: White-haired, small stature, wrinkles, and large-framed eyeglasses. She owned a tan bamboo handbag which became her personal trademark, as she carried the purse everywhere, even around the house (including the bathroom). Sophia&#x27;s sister Angela displayed these traits as well.

While she is the oldest of the four main characters, Getty was younger than both White and Arthur, despite portraying the latter&#x27;s mother.

==Appearances in other media==
Outside &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Sophia appears on two episodes of &quot;Empty Nest&quot; (&quot;Libby&#x27;s Gift&quot; and &quot;Windy&quot;) before becoming a regular for the final two seasons. She also appears on the &quot;Blossom&quot; episode &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got No Buddy&quot; and the &quot;Nurses&quot; episode &quot;Temporary Setbacks&quot;.

In 2018, the gaming app New Yahtzee with Buddies Dice honored Petrillo with a dice master character &quot;Sothreea Petrollo,&quot; recreating Petrillo&#x27;s image in the shape of dice.

<doc id="802029" wikidata="Q116214300" url="?curid=802029" title="Warp and weft">
<text>In the manufacture of cloth, warp and weft are the two basic components in weaving to transform thread and yarn into textile fabrics. The vertical &quot;warp&quot; yarns are held stationary in tension on a loom (frame) while the horizontal &quot;weft&quot; (also called the &quot;woof&quot;) is drawn through (inserted over and under) the warp thread. In the terminology of weaving, each warp thread is called a &quot;warp end&quot;; a &quot;pick&quot; is a single weft thread that crosses the warp thread (synonymous terms are &quot;fill yarn&quot; and &quot;filling yarn&quot;). 

In the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution facilitated the industrialisation of the production of textile fabrics with the &quot;picking stick&quot; and the &quot;flying shuttle&quot;, the latter of which was invented by John Kay, in 1733. The mechanised power loom was patented by Edmund Cartwright in 1785, which allowed sixty picks per minute.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;weft&quot; derives from the Old English word , to weave. &quot;Warp&quot; means &quot;that across which the woof is thrown&quot;. (Old English , from , to throw, cf. German , Dutch ).

==Warp==


The warp is the set of yarns or other things stretched in place on a loom before the weft is introduced during the weaving process. It is regarded as the &quot;longitudinal&quot; set in a finished fabric with two or more sets of elements.

The term is also used for a set of yarns established before the interworking of weft yarns by some other method, such as finger manipulation, yielding wrapped or twined structures. Very simple looms use a spiral warp, in which the warp is made up of a single, very long yarn wound in a spiral pattern around a pair of sticks or beams.

The warp must be strong to be held under high tension during the weaving process, unlike the weft which carries almost no tension. This requires the yarn used for warp ends, or individual warp threads, to be made of spun and plied fibre. Traditionally natural fibres such as wool, linen, alpaca, and silk were used. However, improvements in spinning technology during the Industrial Revolution created cotton yarn of sufficient strength to be used in mechanized weaving. Later, synthetic fibres such as nylon or rayon were employed.

While most weaving is weft-faced, warp-faced textiles are created using densely arranged warp threads. In these the design is in the warp, requiring all colors to be decided upon and placed during the first part of the weaving process, which cannot be changed. Such limitations of color placement create weavings defined by length-wise stripes and vertical designs. Many South American cultures, including the ancient Incas and Aymaras, employed &quot;backstrap weaving&quot;, which uses the weight of the weaver&#x27;s body to control the tension of the loom.

==Weft==

Because the weft does not have to be stretched on a loom the way the warp is, it can generally be less strong. Originally spun yarns were used, from fibres such as wool, flax and cotton. Today also viscose (rayon) types and synthetic fibres, such as polyester and polyamide (nylon) are used.

The weft is threaded through the warp using a &quot;shuttle&quot;, air jets or &quot;rapier grippers&quot;. Handlooms were the original weaver&#x27;s tool, with the shuttle being threaded through alternately raised warps by hand.

==As metaphor==

The expression &quot;warp and weft&quot; (also &quot;warp and woof&quot; and &quot;woof and warp&quot;) is used metaphorically the way &quot;fabric&quot; is; e.g., &quot;the warp and woof of a student&#x27;s life&quot; equates to &quot;the fabric of a student&#x27;s life&quot;. Warp and weft are sometimes used even more generally in literature to describe the basic dichotomy of the world we live in, as in, up/down, in/out, black/white, Sun/Moon, yin/yang, etc. The expression is also used similarly for the underlying structure upon which something is built. The terms &quot;warp&quot; and &quot;woof&quot; are also found in some English translations of the Bible in the discussion of mildews found in cloth materials in Leviticus 13:48-59.

In computing, a &quot;warp&quot; is a term for a block of parallel threads executed on a GPU or similar SIMD device.

<doc id="802030" wikidata="Q3267742" url="?curid=802030" title="Madrigal comedy">
<text>Madrigal comedy is a term for a kind of entertainment music of the late 16th century in Italy, in which groups of related, generally &quot;a cappella&quot; madrigals were sung consecutively, generally telling a story, and sometimes having a loose dramatic plot. It is an important element in the origins of opera. The term is of 20th-century origin, popularised by Alfred Einstein.

The first collection of madrigals, sung as a set and telling a coherent (and highly comic) story, was &quot;Il cicalamento delle donne al bucato&quot; (the gossip of women at the laundry), by Alessandro Striggio, which was written in 1567. 
Later madrigal comedies are sometimes divided into acts, including a prologue, and while not &quot;acted&quot; in the sense of an opera, they may have been performed on stage with elaborate painted backdrops (for example, the woodcut showing the prologue of Orazio Vecchi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amfiparnaso&quot; (1597): a singer is evidently in costume in a backdrop showing a city street). Vecchi&#x27;s direction in the score, however, is for the singers not to act, but for the audience to fill in the action internally, using their imagination. He speaks to the audience in the prologue to the work: &quot;the spectacle I speak of is to be seen in your mind; it enters not through your eyes, but through your ears: instead of looking, listen, and be silent.&quot;

The form was popular especially in the 1590s and few years after 1600, only in Italy, but seems to have fallen out of favor with the advent of opera right at 1600, although &quot;a cappella&quot; madrigals were also disappearing at this time as well. The music of madrigal comedies is light, and the subject matter was invariably comic.

Principal composers of madrigal comedy included Alessandro Striggio, Adriano Banchieri, Giovanni Croce, and Orazio Vecchi.

<text>Jens Ola Johansson (born 2 November 1963 in Stockholm) is a Swedish keyboardist and pianist. Jens got famous in the early 80&#x27;s when he and his brother Anders (drums) joined Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s &quot;Rising Force&quot;. Jens is the son of the Swedish Jazz pianist Jan Johansson. Jens has also worked with the guitar player Allan Holdsworth. 

He&#x27;s currently working with the Finnish power metal band Stratovarius and Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s rock project Rainbow. He is notable for his high-speed and technical skills in the style of neoclassical, fusion and rock.

==Biography==
Johansson is son of Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and brother of Ex-HammerFall drummer Anders Johansson. He is highly influenced by classic rock keyboardists like Don Airey, Eddie Jobson and Jon Lord. In 1982, the classically trained Johansson left the jazz fusion band Slem and joined the Swedish metal band Silver Mountain, which also included Anders. In 1983 he left Sweden for California and joined guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen as a member of his band, Rising Force. Numerous records and world tours ensued and he stayed with Yngwie until 1989. Johansson also played with the band Dio between 1989 and 1990. Like Anders, he began an ongoing collaboration with Jonas Hellborg in 1989 which has resulted in several progressive and avant-garde recordings, including &quot;Dissident&quot;, &quot;Unseen Rain&quot; (an acoustic piano trio record with Ginger Baker on drums) and the hard core progressive fusion record, &quot;E&quot;.

In 1993, Johansson co-founded a progressive blues metal project, The Johansson Brothers, and recorded a self-titled record. In 1996, with a different line-up, they recorded another album, &quot;Sonic Winter&quot;, this time under the name &quot;Johansson&quot;, with Yngwie Malmsteen guesting on guitar. The last Johansson record, &quot;The Last Viking&quot;, a more &quot;European metal&quot; oriented album, was released in 1999 with special guests Michael Romeo and Göran Edman.

Johansson has released several instrumental solo records such as &quot;Fjäderlösa Tvåfotingar&quot;, &quot;Ten Seasons&quot; (a piano solo album improvised in the Mark Kostabi gallery, New York), &quot;Heavy Machinery&quot; (with Anders and Allan Holdsworth) and &quot;Fission&quot; (with Anders, Shawn Lane and Mike Stern) and many collaborations with other artists, metal compilations and Berends Brothers&#x27; band Mastermind.

He co-founded Heptagon Records to distribute his own recordings and that of other musicians, such as guitarist Benny Jansson and bassist Magnus Rosén. Johansson auditioned for Dream Theater after Kevin Moore left the band in 1994 but due to many delays by the band in making a decision he instead joined Finnish power metal band Stratovarius. Since 1995 he has remained in Stratovarius, and still releasing solo albums and appearing as a guest or session musician in other projects.

Johansson is a self-confessed computer nerd, admitting to have started on an Atari ST (which he still owns), and having coded software in C, as well as his own website in Perl. He rejects being considered one of the best keyboardists in the world, as he believes there are many people that are far better than him.

==Gear==
Johansson has used many types of keyboards and synthesizers throughout his career. Amongst his favourites are the Korg Polysix, Yamaha DX7 as a MIDI controller, (from the Rising Force times to present), the Oberheim Matrix Series and the Roland JV-1080 sound module. He is also fond of the Hammond Organ. Johansson is a computer fan and long-time Steinberg programs user (like Cubase). An example of his interest in computers is his record &quot;Fission&quot;, which is replete with special effects and sound experimentation. His signature lead is emulation of Polysix on JV1080, going thru early Amp simulation / distortion pedal JD-10 by Morley.

Recently, he has been using PC-base system with Lenovo Laptop Computer both recording and live. And he uses JV1080 as backup on live.

<text>The Spider-Slayers are a series of fictional robots appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Spencer Smythe, they were designed specifically to hunt down, capture, or kill Spider-Man. A new generation of Spider-Slayers was later created by Spencer&#x27;s son, Alistair.

The Spider-Slayers have been featured in a number of Spider-Man adaptations outside of comics, including animated series and video games.

==Publication history==
The Spider-Slayers first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #25 (June 1965) and were created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.

==Fictional character biography==
:&quot;See List of Spider-Slayers for a full breakdown of all versions of the Spider-Slayer.&quot;

The first series of robots were originally designed and built by Prof. Spencer Smythe with the financial backing of J. Jonah Jameson, who piloted them for the pleasure of personally hunting the superhero he hated for capture and public unmasking. However, Spider-Man always managed to defeat each robot in turn. Smythe&#x27;s continual efforts to perfect his machines backfired on him, leading to himself being fatally contaminated by radiation poisoning from the building materials of his creations. Blaming both Jameson and Spider-Man for this, he attempted, as a final act, to murder them both, but died just before Spider-Man thwarted the attempt.

At one point, Jameson commissioned another scientist, Dr. Marla Madison, to create a new and improved Spider-Slayer. While that attempt failed, he eventually fell in love with her and married her.

In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; Annual #19 (1985), Smythe&#x27;s son, Alistair, emerged as the new builder of the Spider-Slayers. He swore revenge on Spider-Man, repeatedly attacking the superhero with his own series of Slayers. Smythe later mutated into a humanoid Spider-Slayer, but remains a minor foe.

The original Spider-Slayer was seen among the robots and machines in the Reanimator&#x27;s collection. Wolverine later destroyed the Spider-Slayer when the Reanimator attempted to use it against him. It was later used by J. Jonah Jameson to attack the She-Hulk after she had married his son John, but it was destroyed again.

In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #603, Jameson (now Mayor of New York) has some old Spider-Slayers sent to him from storage to better equip his &quot;Anti-Spider Squad&quot; to take down Spider-Man. The Spider-Slayer technology is combined with that of the Mandroid suits. However, the &quot;Spider-Slayer Squad&quot; wearing the suits quit their jobs after Spider-Man saves them and New York from a dirty bomb.

Despite not being technically related to the Smythes&#x27; and Madison&#x27;s creations, when Spider-Man refits all the Octobots confiscated from Doctor Octopus and kept in the New York Police Precinct to carry an antidote able to reverse the mutations turning all the New York population into Man-Spiders, he humorously renames them his own &quot;Spider-Slayers&quot;.

When the Goblin King and his Goblin Underground group cause havoc in Manhattan, Mayor J. Jonah Jameson unveils the Goblin-Slayers which he plans to use against the Goblin-related threats. Mary Jane Watson voices her concern that the Goblin-Slayers used to be former Spider-Slayers. Mayor J. Jonah Jameson orders Chief Pratchett to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in Peter Parker&#x27;s body). After Don Lamaze sacrifices his life to get out of the Goblin King&#x27;s trap, the Superior Spider-Man confronted by a legion of Spider-Slayers with Mayor J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s face projected on the front faceplate. Mayor J. Jonah Jameson replies that he is done with being blackmailed by him and he does not care if he loses everything as long as he can finally bring down Spider-Man. The Superior Spider-Man tries to fight the Spider-Slayers, but discovers that they are far stronger than all the previous ones. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are deactivated remotely by Spider-Man 2099, who confronts the Superior Spider-Man about who he really is and the reasons behind his actions of late. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated, to Spider-Man 2099&#x27;s shock. The Goblin King&#x27;s voice rings out, declaring that he has taken control of the Spider-Slayers as well, which grab both Spider-Men by their heads as the Goblin King comments that Norman Osborn now runs this city.

In a &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; storyline following Smythe&#x27;s death, dealers illegally sell Spider-Slayers to foreign nations. However, after Miguel accompanies Tiberus Stone on one such deal, he ends up fighting the Scorpion (who was hired by Alchemax to further test the Spider-Slayers) as Stone is captured by the local rebels, Miguel defeating the Scorpion by tricking the Spider-Slayers into attacking him, while Stone&#x27;s encounter with the rebels prompts him to change his mind about the original deal.

==List of Spider-Slayers==
==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Spider-Slayers are eight foot robots that balance on a large sphere, wield two arm-cannons and have a sphere for a head, and built and controlled remotely by the Tinkerer. Created in the event Spider-Man ever went rogue, the Spider-Slayers are deployed by Nick Fury to Peter Parker&#x27;s residence when clones of Spider-Man begin running rampant, with the Slayers&#x27; objective being to arrest Peter Parker. The Slayers encounter the Fantastic Four and Carnage which reverts to Gwen Stacy after the Spider-Slayers take her down. The Spider-Slayers later kill a disfigured clone and imprison another unstable clone in S.H.I.E.L.D. A second Spider Slayer, this one able to trace Peter by detecting his DNA, is created by Mysterio. It is later destroyed.

===MC2===
While trying to apprehend a dimension-hopping supervillain in the MC2 reality, Spider-Girl is accidentally sent into Earth-616&#x27;s past, where she encounters the first Spider-Slayer. Mistaking her for its quarry, the Spider-Slayer attacks Spider-Girl who manages to evade the machine due to being distracted by how different &quot;Spider-Man&quot; looks. Spider-Girl later returns to her own universe and time, while Spider-Man defeats the Spider-Slayer in the same way he did in the original story.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, J. Jonah Jameson (fearing Peter Parker would take revenge due to outing as Spider-Man) has Alistair Smythe construct a Spider-Slayer as protection. When Peter&#x27;s family breaks into Jonah&#x27;s home looking for Peter&#x27;s journal (given by the Green Goblin) Jonah, using the Spider-Slayer, attacks. Hitting Gwen Stacy just as Peter arrives, Jonah&#x27;s Spider-Slayer is ripped to shreds by the hero.

=== &quot;What If&quot; ===
In an issue of &quot;What If&quot;, May Parker and John Jameson are killed in a space shuttle crash caused by the Chameleon, J. Jonah Jameson adopts Peter Parker, and blames the deaths of their loved ones on Spider-Man. Obsessed with taking Spider-Man down, Jameson commissions the creation of the Spider-Slayer and the Scorpion formula, the latter of which is ingested by Flash Thompson. The serum warps Flash&#x27;s mind and causes Flash to go on a rampage, which ends when subdued by Spider-Man (who reveals being Peter Parker to Jameson) and the Spider-Slayer, controlled by Jameson. Jameson realizes how irrational his hatred of Spider-Man is, and decides to help his adopted son fight crime using the Spider-Slayer.

==In other media==
===Television===

* The Mark I Spider-Slayer appears in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1967) episode &quot;Captured by J. Jonah Jameson&quot;. This version was built by Henry Smythe and is equipped with two metallic tentacle-like arms.
* The Spider-Slayers appear in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994), consisting of robotic models the &quot;Black Widow&quot;, the &quot;Tarantula&quot;, and the &quot;Scorpion&quot;, the &quot;Mega Slayer&quot; android, and genetic mutation Alistair Smythe / Ultimate Spider-Slayer.
* The Spider-Slayers appear in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;. These versions are creations of HYDRA and Doctor Octopus, who combined Spider-Man&#x27;s DNA with Arnim Zola&#x27;s Synthezoids. The group consists of Kaine (voiced by Drake Bell), Scarlet Spider (voiced by Scott Porter), and the Delta-Nine Synthezoids: Bone Spider, Goliath Spider (both voiced by Imari Williams), and Ghost Spider (voiced by Roger Craig Smith). Kaine is an imperfect Synthezoid who is highly resistant to damage, can reattach lost limbs, and feed off Spider-Man or the other Spider-Slayers&#x27; life energy. Scarlet Spider, later named Ben Reilly by May Parker, is an almost perfect clone of Spider-Man barring a facial scar and powers. Bone Spider has claws and spikes all over his body; Goliath Spider is the strongest Spider-Slayer who can turn his body into metal; and Ghost Spider can teleport, become intangible, and generate bio-electricity. Scarlet Spider infiltrates Spider-Man&#x27;s Web Warriors to serve as Doctor Octopus&#x27; spy before eventually defecting to them while Kaine and the Delta-Nine Synthezoids mount failed attempts at killing the Web Warriors. Though Kaine absorbs the other Synthezoids to become the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Slayer&quot;, he is defeated by Agent Venom.
* The Spider-Slayers appear in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2017). These versions resemble spiders and come in human-sized, mecha-sized, and miniature variants. The original Spider-Slayers were created by Spencer Smythe before Oscorp stole his schematics and created their own versions.

In the SNES version, the Mark X and XIV Spider-Slayers appear as bosses, the Mark XVI and Mark XVII models appear as regular enemies, and the Mark XV is featured only in Spectacular mode. Additionally, the Mark X, XIV, XVI, and XVII Spider-Slayers return as enemies in the final level. The Mark X model also appears in a secret room in the sewers in Spectacular mode. In the Sega Genesis version, the Mark XV Spider-Slayer appears in the &quot;Deconstruction Zone&quot; level while the Mark X model is the boss of the &quot;Mean Streets of the City&quot; level.

* The Spider-Slayers appear in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers&quot;.
* The Spider-Slayers appear in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002). These versions are human-sized mechanical spiders previously known as &quot;Hunter-Killers&quot; created by Oscorp to hunt down the Scorpion initially and later Spider-Man.
* The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of the Spider-Slayers appear in &quot;Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions&quot;. These versions are large androids armed with flamethrowers that were created by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a counter-measure to symbiotes.
* The Spider-Slayers, referred to as S-Bots, appear in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012). These versions were created by Oscorp under the supervision of Alistair Smythe as a countermeasure for the company&#x27;s cross-species experiments. They consist of Sentries (which come in Medical, Combat, and Advanced Combat variants), Seekers (used to track down cross-species), and Hunters (arachnid-like flying robots called in by the Seekers to eliminate cross-species once they are found). There are also three special robots created specifically for citywide threats: S-01, a larger version of the Hunter that cannot fly, but can shoot lasers and homing missiles; S-02, a giant tentacled serpentine robot equipped with large drills that allow it to tunnel through buildings and underground; and S-03, a massive, heavily-armed scorpion-like machine.
** The Hunters and Seekers return in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; (2014), in which they are used by the &quot;Enhanced Crime Task Force&quot; to hunt down Spider-Man if his hero reputation is too low.

===Merchandise===

<text>Harrie Irving Hancock (January 16, 1868 – March 12, 1922) was an American chemist and writer, mainly remembered as an author of children&#x27;s literature and juveniles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and as having written a fictional depiction of a German invasion of the United States.

==Biography==
Hancock was born in Massachusetts on January 16, 1868. His parents were William Henry and Laura (Oakes) Hancock. Hancock married Nellie Stein on December 21, 1887. They had two daughters, apparently adopted: Vivian Morris Hancock and Doris Hancock.

A prolific author who liked to work at night, Hancock wrote for the &quot;New York Journal&quot;, the &quot;New York World&quot;, and &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Much of his writing was the kind of &quot;Boy&#x27;s books&quot; initiated by the famous Stratemeyer Syndicate, based on the assumption (which proved hugely successful) that &quot;boys want the thrill of feeling &#x27;grown-up&#x27;&quot; and that they like books which give them that feeling to come in series where the same heroes appear again and again. However, the bulk of Hancock&#x27;s works in that genre appear to have been handled by publishers other than Stratemeyer. (A comprehensive list of his publications does not yet exist, the list appearing on this page being far from complete).

For some time it was considered that, unlike other writers, he invariably used his own name, in the form &quot;H. Irving Hancock&quot;. However, Edward T. LeBlanc and J. Randolph Cox, who researched the period&#x27;s &quot;dime novels&quot;, concluded that a series of books attributed to &quot;Douglas Wells&quot; were in fact written by Hancock.

The same researchers recount that Hancock &quot;had been a journalist for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; from 1885 to 1890 [and] produced more than 50 serials for Norman Munro&#x27;s juvenile magazine &quot;Golden Hours&quot; between 1889 and 1901.&quot; In 1898 Hancock travelled to Cuba with the US forces as one of several &quot;embedded&quot; reporters and published an account of his war experiences later the same year under the title &quot;What One Man Saw, Being the Personal Impressions of a War Correspondent in Cuba&quot;. He also reported on the US-Spanish war in the Philippines.

His output included westerns, detective stories (set in New Orleans and in Asia), and historical adventures. China and Japan were the setting of such stories as &#x27;The Great Tan-To; or Dick Brent&#x27;s Adventures in Up-to-Date Japan&#x27;.&quot; Hancock was charged with perpetuating racial stereotypes in his depiction of the Chinese &quot;Supervillain&quot; Li Shoon in a series of stories published between 1915 and 1917&quot;. Conversely, he had a sympathetic attitude toward Japan, setting stories there and coauthoring a book on ju-jitsu with a noted Japanese adept in the art.

Hancock&#x27;s experience as a war correspondent provided inspiration for books about the Spanish–American War. He also published books on physical fitness and an &quot;Encyclopedia of Knowledge and Manners&quot;, and served as the editor of a &quot;History of West Point&quot;. In a magazine article he warned of the dangers of smoking, at a time when such dangers were not widely known. He was also apparently a sports writer and an early Western expert on Jiu-Jitsu.

Much of Hancock&#x27;s writing had a patriotic character, his books and stories having a considerable proportion of military heroes placed in settings ranging from the American Revolutionary War, through the Spanish–American War and the First World War, and up to an imaginary German invasion of the United States (see following section).

In addition to his writing activity, Hancock organized the Ferguson-Hancock Laboratories together with Prof. George A. Ferguson in 1908.

Hancock died of liver ailments at his home, in Blue Point, Suffolk County, New York on March 12, 1922.

Despite the enormous amount of material published by Hancock, some of his biographical details are not completely clear. The 1920 United States Federal Census contains the following: &quot;H. Hancock, Birth: abt 1868 – Massachusetts Residence: 1920 – Brookhaven, Suffolk, New York&quot;. This seems to refer to Harrie Irving Hancock, but it is not completely certain—hence the above question mark following the date of his birth.

According to Gene Horton of Blue Point, Hancock is buried in an unmarked grave at the Blue Point Cemetery.

One Hancock book still in print is &quot;The Complete Kano Jiu-Jitsu (Judo)&quot;, co-authored with Katsukuma Higashi and originally published by G. P. Putnam &amp; Sons in 1905 in New York (presently republished by Dover Publications).

==&quot;The Invasion of the United States&quot;==

Hancock&#x27;s four-book series The Invasion of the United States, published in 1916, depicted a fictional invasion of the United States by Germany in 1920–21—reflecting, and to some degree helping to intensify, the shift of American public opinion towards getting involved in the First World War. It was an American representative of the subgenre known as invasion literature which originated in Britain and was frequent in the early Twentieth Century. This kind of book was criticised —by some politicians at the time and by historians and researchers later— with intensifying bellicose public attitudes in various countries and contributing to escalation and war. Others treated them as reasonable anticipations of the current situation, such as Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1912 story “Danger!”, in which Britain is brought to her knees by an unnamed power cutting off her food supplies using submarine warfare.

The series may have been influenced by William Le Queux&#x27;s &quot;The Great War in England in 1897&quot; (1894) in which the French launch a surprise invasion of England and penetrate into the heart of London but are finally defeated after much desperate and heroic fighting by the British protagonists. The book was highly popular in the early Twentieth Century, and Hancock is likely to have read it.

In Hancock&#x27;s far more extensive version, constituting no less than four books, it is the Germans who launch a surprise attack in 1920, capture Boston despite heroic resistance by &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s boys&quot;, overrun all of New England and New York and reach as far as Pittsburgh—but are at last are gloriously crushed by fresh American forces. From the present-day point of view, it can be considered as &quot;retroactive&quot; alternate history.

Hancock&#x27;s plot has a difficulty in that it assumes either an overwhelming German victory over the British, giving them mastery of the seas, or a British &quot;friendly neutrality&quot; and a free hand to invade America. Further, it assumes the German Navy to be capable of utterly defeating the US Navy, followed by ferrying no less than a million German troops across the Atlantic and keeping them supplied for years-long hard fighting. The experience of the first two years of the actual war, at the time of writing, already conclusively proved the Kaiserliche Marine manifestly incapable of anything remotely of the kind. In actuality it was US soldiers who—a year after the story&#x27;s publication—would pour across a British-dominated Atlantic to assault Germany in Europe. Hancock, therefore, assumed that Germany had won the World War, and that the USA had not built up its Navy and Army (the men fighting remark several times that the politicians had neglected the national defense).

The war launched by the German Empire in the story is intended, not to conquer the US, but to pressure it to give up the Monroe Doctrine. This will leave Germany free to seize parts of Brazil, and take colonies elsewhere in the New World. Hancock has it follow the actual, hypothetical Imperial German plans for the invasion of the United States, involving the bombardment of New York and the seizure of Boston. A neutral or US-hostile Canada is assumed; in the story, this is because of US failure to aid Britain, leading to her defeat in the World War. Peace would then be negotiated, with a reduced US military, and parts of the Eastern Seaboard occupied by Imperial German troops, as a guarantee against further opposition to German plans for expansion

However, alternate history writer and analyst Dale Cozort notes that &quot;(...)The broad outline of the war [depicted] is so much like what actually happened between Germany and Russia 25 or so years later, in World War II, that it&#x27;s almost uncanny. The Germans win battle after battle but the opposition moves industry out of their reach, builds up overwhelming superiority in manpower and strategic mobility, then cuts off the cream of the German army. Sounds a lot like Eastern Front World War II up through Stalingrad&quot;. Cozort also notes that Hancock&#x27;s is one of the first fictional depictions of war to make reference to tanks.

Hancock appears to have been among the first American writers to graphically describe their country being devastatingly invaded by powerful enemies—reflecting the disruption of the hitherto dominant American isolationist mindset. In later decades he was followed by a host of others depicting the US being fictionally invaded by Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union and China, as well as a considerable array of extraterrestrial aliens (see Invasion literature, Yellow Peril, Earth in fiction, &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Solution&quot;). In effect, this subgenre went full circle with the alternative history novel &quot;1901&quot; by Robert Conroy, depicting a fictitious invasion of the United States by Kaiser Wilhelm&#x27;s Germany in the title year, bearing quite a bit of resemblance to Hancock&#x27;s work. They may have both drawn from the same set of speculative war plans made by the German Empire.

<doc id="802042" wikidata="Q212272" url="?curid=802042" title="Hydroxycarbamide">
<text>Hydroxycarbamide, also known as hydroxyurea, is an antimetabolite medication used in sickle-cell disease, essential thrombocythemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, and cervical cancer. In sickle-cell disease it increases fetal hemoglobin and decreases the number of attacks. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, fevers, loss of appetite, psychiatric problems, shortness of breath, and headaches. There is also concern that it increases the risk of later cancers. Use during pregnancy is typically harmful to the fetus. Hydroxycarbamide is in the antineoplastic family of medications. It is believed to work by blocking the making of DNA.
Hydroxycarbamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Hydroxycarbamide is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Hydroxycarbamide is used for the following indications:
* Myeloproliferative disease (primarily essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera). It has been found to be superior to anagrelide for the control of ET.
* Sickle-cell disease (increases production of fetal hemoglobin that then interferes with the hemoglobin polymerisation as well as by reducing white blood cells that contribute to the general inflammatory state in sickle cell patients.)
* Second line treatment for psoriasis (slows down the rapid division of skin cells)
* Systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm(SM-AHN) (The utility in treating SM-AHN with hydroxycarbamide stems from its myelosuppressive activity, it does not however exhibit any selective anti-mast cell activity)
* Chronic myelogenous leukemia (largely replaced by imatinib, but still in use for its cost-effectiveness)

==Side effects==
Reported side effects are: neurological reactions (e.g., headache, dizziness, drowsiness, disorientation, hallucinations, and convulsions), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, mucositis, anorexia, stomatitis, bone marrow toxicity (dose-limiting toxicity; may take 7–21 days to recover after the drug has been discontinued), megaloblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation, immunosuppression, leukopenia, alopecia (hair loss), skin rashes (e.g., maculopapular rash), erythema, pruritus, vesication or irritation of the skin and mucous membranes, pulmonary edema, abnormal liver enzymes, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.

Due to its negative effect on the bone marrow, regular monitoring of the full blood count is vital, as well as early response to possible infections. In addition, renal function, uric acid and electrolytes, as well as liver enzymes, are commonly checked. Moreover, because of this, its use in people with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or severe anemia is contraindicated.

Hydroxycarbamide has been used primarily for the treatment of myeloproliferative diseases, which has an inherent risk of transforming to acute myeloid leukemia. There has been a longstanding concern that hydroxycarbamide itself carries a leukemia risk, but large studies have shown that the risk is either absent or very small. Nevertheless, it has been a barrier for its wider use in patients with sickle-cell disease.

==Mechanism of action==
Hydroxycarbamide decreases the production of deoxyribonucleotides via inhibition of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase by scavenging tyrosyl free radicals as they are involved in the reduction of nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs). Additionally, hydroxycarbamide causes production of reactive oxygen species in cells, leading to disassembly of replicative DNA polymerase enzymes and arresting DNA replication. 

In the treatment of sickle-cell disease, hydroxycarbamide increases the concentration of fetal hemoglobin. The precise mechanism of action is not yet clear, but it appears that hydroxycarbamide increases nitric oxide levels, causing soluble guanylyl cyclase activation with a resultant rise in cyclic GMP, and the activation of gamma globin gene expression and subsequent gamma chain synthesis necessary for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production (which does not polymerize and deform red blood cells like the mutated HbS, responsible for sickle cell disease). Adult red cells containing more than 1% HbF are termed F cells. These cells are progeny of a small pool of immature committed erythroid precursors (BFU-e) that retain the ability to produce HbF. Hydroxyurea also suppresses the production of granulocytes in the bone marrow which has a mild immunosuppressive effect particularly at vascular sites where sickle cells have occluded blood flow.

==Natural occurrence==
Hydroxyurea has been reported as endogenous in human blood plasma at concentrations of approximately 30 to 200 ng/ml.

==Chemistry==

Hydroxyurea has been prepared in many different ways since its initial synthesis in 1869. The original synthesis by Dresler and Stein was based around the reaction of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and potassium cyanate. Hydroxyurea lay dormant for more than fifty years until it was studied as part of an investigation into the toxicity of protein metabolites. Due to its chemical properties hydroxyurea was explored as an antisickling agent in the treatment of hematological conditions.

One common mechanism for synthesizing hydroxyurea is by the reaction of calcium cyanate with hydroxylamine nitrate in absolute ethanol and by the reaction of a cyanate salt and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in aqueous solution. Hydroxyurea has also been prepared by converting a quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin from the chloride form to the cyanate form with sodium cyanate and reacting the resin in the cyanate form with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. This method of hydroxyurea synthesis was patented by Hussain et al. (2015).

==Pharmacology==
Hydroxyurea is a monohydroxyl-substituted urea (hydroxycarbamate) antimetabolite. Similar to other antimetabolite anti-cancer drugs, it acts by disrupting the DNA replication process of dividing cancer cells in the body. Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, an enzyme required to convert ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, thereby preventing cells from leaving the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. This agent also exhibits radiosensitizing activity by maintaining cells in the radiation-sensitive G1 phase and interfering with DNA repair.

Biochemical research has explored its role as a DNA replication inhibitor which causes deoxyribonucleotide depletion and results in DNA double strand breaks near replication forks (see DNA repair). Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents.

Hydroxyurea has many pharmacological applications under the Medical Subject Headings classification system:
* Antineoplastic agents – Substances that inhibit or prevent the proliferation of neoplasms.
* Antisickling agents – Agents used to prevent or reverse the pathological events leading to sickling of erythrocytes in sickle cell conditions.
* Nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors – Compounds that inhibit cell production of DNA or RNA.
* Enzyme inhibitors – Compounds or agents that combine with an enzyme in such a manner as to prevent the normal substrate-enzyme combination and the catalytic reaction.
* Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 inhibitors – Agents that inhibit one of the most important enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body, CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed oxidase system.

<text>Fajada Butte is a butte in Chaco Culture National Historical Park, in northwest New Mexico.

Fajada Butte (Banded Butte) rises 135 meters above the canyon floor. Although there is no water source on the butte, there are ruins of small cliff dwellings in the higher regions of the butte. Analysis of fragments of pottery found on Fajada show that these structures were used between the 10th to 13th centuries.
The remains of a 95-meter-high, 230-meter-long ramp are evident on the southwestern face of the butte (Ford 1993, p. 478). The magnitude of this building project, without an apparent utilitarian purpose, indicates that Fajada Butte may have had considerable ceremonial importance for the Chacoan people.

==Sun Dagger site==
In 1977 the artist Anna Sofaer visited Chaco Canyon as a volunteer recording rock art. There she recorded petroglyphs on Fajada Butte at what is now called the Sun Dagger site, now perhaps the most famous site in Chaco Canyon, located at a southeastern facing cliff near the top of Fajada Butte. She noted three large stone slabs leaning against the cliff which channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall. On her second visit she saw a &quot;dagger of light&quot; bisecting one of the spirals. At about 11:15 am. on the summer solstice a dagger-shaped light form pierces the larger of the two spirals (Sofaer, Zinser and Sinclair 1979, p. 285). Similar sun daggers mark the winter solstice and equinoxes {Sofaer, Zinser and Sinclair 1979, p. 286} At one extreme in the moon&#x27;s eighteen- to nineteen-year cycle (the lunar minor standstill), a shadow bisects the larger spiral just as the moon rises; and at its other extreme, nine-and-a-half years later (the lunar major standstill), the shadow of the rising moon falls on the left edge of the larger spiral.(Sofaer, Sinclair and Doggett 1982, p. 43) In each case these shadows align with pecked grooves (Sofaer and Sinclair 1987, pp. 48 – 59). Due to one of the slabs settling, the &quot;dagger of light&quot; no longer crosses through the center of the spiral during the summer solstice. Public access to the butte was curtailed when, in 1989, erosion from modern foot traffic was found to be responsible for one of the three screening slabs at the &quot;Sun Dagger&quot; site shifting out of its ancient position. Because of that shift, the assemblage of stones has lost some of its former spatial and temporal precision as a solar and lunar calendar. In 1990 the screens were stabilized and placed under observation, but the wayward slab was not moved back into its original orientation.

At two other sites on Fajada Butte, located a short distance below the Sun Dagger site, five petroglyphs are also marked by visually compelling patterns of shadow and light that indicate solar noon distinctively at the solstices and equinoxes (Sofaer and Sinclair 1987, p. 59). It has been noted, however, that these five noontime events are essentially the number one would expect by chance (McCluskey 1988, p. S69).

In the 1980s the National Park Service closed off access to the butte due to the delicate nature of the site and the damage and erosion caused by tourism.

Studies by Sofaer&#x27;s Solstice Project suggest that the major buildings of the ancient Chacoan culture of New Mexico also contain solar and lunar cosmology in three separate articulations: their orientations, internal geometry, and geographic interrelationships were developed in relationship to the cycles of the sun and moon (Sofaer 2007, p. 225).

===Debate===
There are several issues surrounding this site. One is when the two spirals were pecked into the walls, some scholars suggesting it &quot;postdates the height of the Chaco tradition&quot;. Another is its importance. Although other solar observatories constructed by the Pueblo people predict solar events by the movement of the light over a period of time, this one does not. It has also been suggested that it was not built but that those who made the inscriptions were using a convenient existing fall of rock (Kantner 2004, p. 99).

Critics generally agree that the light and shadow phenomena at the site were intended to mark the arrival of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes (Carlson 1987, pp. 86–7; Zeilik 1985, p. S84). There is less agreement on the lunar phenomena; Michael Zeilik found no ethnographic evidence for a concern with the lunar standstill cycle in the historic pueblos (Zeilik 1985, pp. S80-4). He also noted that contemporary pueblo horizon observations achieve greater precision than that possible using the sun-dagger site, leading him to conclude that the Sun Dagger site may have been a sun shrine, but would not have functioned well to regulate the solar calendar (Zeilik 1985, pp. S71, S77–S80).

<doc id="802055" wikidata="Q5286552" url="?curid=802055" title="Dobby loom">
<text>A dobby loom, or dobbie loom, is a type of floor loom that controls all the warp threads using a device called a dobby.

Dobbies can produce more complex fabric designs than tappet looms but are limited in comparison to Jacquard looms.
Dobby looms first appeared around 1843, roughly 40 years after Joseph Marie Jacquard invented the Jacquard device that can be mounted atop a loom to lift the individual heddles and warp threads.

The word &quot;dobby&quot; is a corruption of &quot;draw boy,&quot; which refers to the weaver&#x27;s helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on draw threads.
A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom. Both are floor looms in which every warp thread on the loom is attached to a single shaft using a device called a heddle. A shaft is sometimes known as a harness. Each shaft controls a set of threads. Raising or lowering several shafts at the same time gives a huge variety of possible sheds (gaps) through which the shuttle containing the weft thread can be thrown.

==Control==

A manual dobby uses a chain of bars or lags each of which has pegs inserted to select the shafts to be moved. A computer-assisted dobby loom uses a set of solenoids or other electric devices to select the shafts. Activation of these solenoids is under the control of a computer program. In either case the selected shafts are raised or lowered by either leg power on a dobby pedal or electric or other power sources.

===Manual===
On a treadle loom, each foot-operated treadle is connected by a linkage called a tie-up to one or more shafts. More than one treadle can operate a single shaft. The tie-up consists of cords or similar mechanical linkages tying the treadles to the lams that actually lift or lower the shaft.

On treadle operated looms, the number of sheds is limited by the number of treadles available. An eight-shaft loom can create 254 different sheds. There are actually 256 possibilities, which is 2 to the eighth power, but having all threads up or all threads down is not very useful. Most eight-shaft floor looms have only ten to twelve treadles due to space limitations. This limits the weaver to ten to twelve distinct sheds. It is possible to use both feet to get more sheds, but this is rarely done in practice. It is even possible to change tie-ups in the middle of weaving a cloth but this is a tedious process, so this too is rarely done.

With a dobby loom, all 254 possibilities are available at any time. This vastly increases the number of cloth designs available to the weaver. The advantage of a dobby loom becomes even more pronounced on looms with 12 shafts (4094 possible sheds), 16 shafts (65,534 possible sheds), or more. It reaches its peak on a Jacquard loom in which each thread is individually controlled.

Another advantage to a dobby loom is the ability to handle much longer sequences in the pattern. A weaver working on a treadled loom must remember the entire sequence of treadlings that make up the pattern, and must keep track of where they are in the sequence at all times. Getting lost or making a mistake can ruin the cloth being woven. On a manual dobby the sequence that makes up the pattern is represented by the chain of dobby bars. The length of the sequence is limited by the length of the dobby chain. This can easily be several hundred dobby bars, although an average dobby chain will have approximately fifty bars.

===Computer===
A computer-controlled dobby loom takes this one step further by replacing the mechanical dobby chain with computer-controlled shaft selection. In addition to being able to handle sequences that are virtually unlimited, the construction of the shaft sequences is done on the computer screen rather than by building a mechanical dobby chain. This allows the weaver to load and switch weave drafts in seconds without even getting up from the loom. In addition, the design process performed on the computer provides the weaver with a more intuitive way to design fabric; seeing the pattern on a computer screen is easier than trying to visualize it by looking at the dobby chain.

Dobby looms expand a weaver&#x27;s capabilities and remove some of the tedious work involved in designing and producing fabric. Many newer cloth design techniques such as network drafting can only reach their full potential on a dobby loom.

<doc id="802059" wikidata="Q866795" url="?curid=802059" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana">
<text>The Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or diocese, of the Catholic Church in central Louisiana in the United States. It is a suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of New Orleans.

The diocesan cathedral is St. Francis Xavier Cathedral in Alexandria, Louisiana. It also has a former cathedral and minor basilica: the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, in Natchitoches, Louisiana. The current bishop is Robert W. Marshall.

== Name ==
Since 1853, this diocese has undergone four name changes:

* Diocese of Natchitoches (1853 to 1910), defunct
* Diocese of Alexandria (1910 to 1976), defunct
* Diocese of Alexandria-Shreveport (1976 to 1986), defunct
* Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana (1986 to present)

== Statistics ==
The Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana has a total area of 27,810 km2. It covers the following civil parishes:

Avoyelles, Rapides, Vernon, Natchitoches, Winn, Caldwell, Madison, Franklin, Tensas, Concordia, Catahoula, LaSalle, and Grant.

As of 2023, the diocese had a Catholic population of 37,816 in 50 parishes and 21 missions. It had 65 diocesan priests, 13 extern priests and 4 religious priests. The diocese also had 31 permanent deacons and 17 nuns.

== History ==

=== 1700 to 1800 ===
Reverend Antonio Margil was the first Catholic priest in what is today the Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana. At the time, all of Louisiana was a colony of the Spanish Empire. In 1717, Margil made contact with Adayes Native Americans living near Spanish Lake in what is now Sabine Parish. He founded the mission of San Miguel de Linares. Leaving a Reverend Gusman in charge of the mission, Margil journeyed on foot to Natchitoches to minister to the French Catholics there, then returned to Texas.
In 1718, during a brief war with Spain, French soldiers plundered the Adayes mission, stealing the church vestments and scaring off the congregants. When Margil returned in 1721, he persuaded the Adayes people to return to the mission and rebuilt the church, dedicating it to Our Lady of the Pillar. Franciscan priests operated the Adayes mission after that. By 1725, there were 50 Catholic families living in Natchitoches. The French established a mission near Natchitoches around 1782.

The Vatican in 1793 established the Diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas, covering a large sections of land in the American South.

=== 1800 to 1850 ===
After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, this region because part of the new United States. In 1817, the St. Xavier Chapel was constructed in Alexandria, its first Catholic facility.

In 1829, a Reverend Martin of Avoyelles visited Catholics living along the Red, Black and Ouachita rivers in Louisiana. By 1840, Reverend John Timon, then prefect apostolic of the Republic of Texas, was making regular visits to missions in northern Louisiana.

During this time period, a Reverend O&#x27;Brien, a Dominican priest from Louisville, was visiting Catholics living along the Mississippi River every year. These Catholics periodically drifted on barges to New Orleans to have the priests there bless their marriages and baptize their children.

=== 1850 to 1910 ===
Pope Pius IX erected the Diocese of Natchitoches in 1853, taking most of the State of Louisiana from the Archdiocese of New Orleans. He appointed Augustus Martin from the Diocese of Vincennes as its first bishop. After taking office, Martin had one priest to cover the entire diocese. The Sisters of the Sacred Heart operated a convent at Natchitoches, and the Daughters of the Cross ran several convents in the diocese. During his 22-year-long tenure, Martin recruited priests and religious from Europe for the diocese, established a seminary to train native clergy, founded numerous missions, and erected a cathedral. Martin died in 1875.

The second bishop of Nachitoches was Reverend Francis Xavier Leray, appointed by Pius IX in 1876. During his short tenure, Leray created two new parishes and ordered the use of English instead of French in all church homilies and other instruction. After only two years in Natchitoches, the same pope named Leray in 1879 as coadjutor archbishop of the Archdiocese of New Orleans.

There would be no bishop in Natchitoches for the next five years, until Reverend Anthony Durier of New Orleans was named by Pope Leo XIII in 1884.In 1886, Durier ordered every parish in the diocese to establish a parochial school, and in 1889 he organized the first Catholic school board. He invited several religious orders to the diocese, such as the Sisters of Divine Providence, the Carmelites, and the Jesuits, who established schools in Alexandria, Mansfield, and Shreveport, all in Louisiana. He opened six schools for African-American children, with a total enrollment of more than 300 pupils in 1894. Durier also established seven new parishes and finished construction on the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Natchitoches, which he consecrated in September 1892. After Durier died in 1904, Pope Pius X named Reverend Cornelius Van de Ven as the next bishop of Natchitoches.

=== 1910 to 1976 ===

On August 6. 1910 Pope Pius X renamed the Diocese of Natchitoches as the Diocese of Alexandria. St. Francis Xavier Church became the new diocesan cathedral. Van de Ven recruited the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word to the diocese, where they established North Louisiana&#x27;s first Catholic hospital (Schumpert Medical Center in Shreveport) and St. Joseph&#x27;s orphanage. He promoted lay organizations and served as state chaplain of the Knights of Columbus. During his tenure, new churches and parochial schools were established for African-American Catholics in Marksville and Mansura, Louisiana. Van de Ven died in 1932.

The second bishop of Alexandria was Reverend Daniel Desmond from the Archdiocese of Boston, named by Pope Pius IX in 1932. Desmond established ten new schools, 22 parishes, and 35 churches. He died in 1945. To replace Desmond, Pope Pius XII appointed Reverend Charles Greco of New Orleans as the next bishop of Alexandria. During his tenure, Greco established 33 parishes, over 125 churches and chapels, 100 convents and rectories, and seven health-care facilities. In 1954, he also founded St. Mary&#x27;s Residential Training School in Clarks, Louisiana, and Holy Angels Residential Facility for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities in Shreveport. Greco resigned in 1973. Pope Paul VI appointed Auxiliary Bishop Lawrence Graves of the Diocese of Little Rock as the next bishop of Alexandria in 1973.

=== 1976 to 1986 ===
In 1976, Paul VI renamed the Diocese of Alexandria as the Diocese of Alexandria-Shreveport to reflect the population growth in Shreveport. The Church of St. John Berchmans in Shreveport was designated as the co-cathedral in the diocese. During his tenure, Graves established or improved continuing education for priests, offices for religious education and youth ministry, permanent diaconate program, and the communications apostolate in newspaper, radio, and television. Graves died in 1982. The second bishop of Alexandria-Shreveport was Auxiliary Bishop William Friend, named by Pope John Paul II that same year.

=== 1986 to present ===

In 1986, John Paul II suppressed the Diocese of Alexandria-Shreveport and created two new dioceses: the Diocese of Shreveport and the Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana. The pope appointed Friend as bishop of Shreveport and Reverend John Favalora of New Orleans as bishop of Alexandria in Louisiana.

After three years, John Paul II in 1989 named Favalora as bishop of the Diocese of St. Petersburg. To replace him in Alexandria in Louisiana, the pope selected Reverend Sam Jacobs of the Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana. After becoming bishop, Jacobs held town meeting in every parish in the diocese to meet parishioners and hear their concerns. Under Jacobs, the diocese inaugurated the Steubenville South Youth Conference and constructed a new youth center at the Maryhill Renewal Center in Alexandria, to accommodate youth retreats. In 2003, John Paul II named Jacobs as bishop of the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux.

In 2004, Monsignor Ronald Herzog of the Diocese of Biloxi was appointed Bishop of Alexandria in Louisiana by John Paul II. In 2016, Pope Francis named Auxiliary Bishop David Talley of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, as coadjutor bishop in the diocese to assist Herzog. When Herzog retired in 2017, Talley automatically became bishop. Two years later in 2019, the pope selected Talley as the new bishop of the Diocese of Memphis.

The current bishop of Alexandria in Louisiana is Robert W. Marshall of Memphis, named by Francis in 2017.

=== Sexual abuse ===
A 2002 article by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; revealed that in 1998 Bishop Jacobs received an allegation of fondling against Reverend John Andries, a parish priest in Natchitoches Parish. Jacobs suspended Andries and removed him from his parish. However, after Andries received counseling and testing, Jacobs returned him to the same parish. Jacobs did not notify authorities about the accusation. In 2002, Andries was charged with abuse of a minor while sleeping a family&#x27;s house in Abbeville. The boy&#x27;s family sued Jacobs and the diocese In May 2003, Andries pleaded guilty to charges of molestation of a juvenile and was sentenced to five years in prison, with three years suspended. The Vatican laicized him in 2007.

The diocese in 2006 suspended Reverend Frederick Lyons, a retired priest, from ministry after receiving allegations from two individuals that he sexually abused them as minors. In November 2023, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith ordered Lyons to follow a life of prayer and penance and stripped him of this title of protonotary apostolic supernumerary.

The diocese in March 2013 removed Reverend Jamie Medina-Cruz from his post at St. Mary&#x27;s Assumption Church in Cottonport after he was arrested on charges of sexual misconduct with a minor. Medina-Cruz was found dead in a motel room in Alexandria in June 2013.

In February 2019, the diocese released the names of 27 diocesan clergy who were accused of committing sexual abuse. Two clergy on this list were convicted while three others gave financial settlements to their victims. Three more names were added to this list in June 2019. Reverend Theodore Lelieveld was added to the clergy list in September 2019 after sexual abuse allegations against him from the 1960s were deemed credible.

In October 2024, the diocese announced that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it continues to face several sexual abuse lawsuits.

<doc id="802065" wikidata="Q4127185" url="?curid=802065" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency">
<text>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (CAH) is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired production of cortisol in the adrenal glands.
It is classified as an inherited metabolic disorder. CAH is an autosomal recessive condition since it results from inheriting two copies of the faulty &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene responsible for 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency. The most common forms of CAH are: &quot;classical&quot; form, usually diagnosed at birth, and &quot;nonclassical&quot;, late onset form, typically diagnosed during childhood or adolescence, although it can also be identified in adulthood when seeking medical help for fertility concerns or other related issues, such as PCOS or menstrual irregularities. Carriers for the alleles of the nonclassical forms may have no symptoms, such form of CAH is sometimes called &quot;cryptic&quot; form. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in all its forms accounts for over 95% of diagnosed cases of all types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Unless another specific enzyme is mentioned, CAH in most contexts refers to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and different mutations related to enzyme impairment have been mapped on protein structures of the enzyme. It is one of the most common autosomal recessive genetic diseases in humans.
Due to the loss of 21-hydroxylase function, patients are unable to efficiently synthesize cortisol. As a result, ACTH levels increase, leading to adrenocortical hyperplasia and overproduction of cortisol precursors, which are used in the synthesis of sex steroids, which can lead to signs of androgen excess, including ambiguous genitalia in newborn girls and rapid postnatal growth in both sexes. In severe cases of CAH in females, surgical reconstruction may be considered to create more female-appearing external genitalia. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the timing and necessity of surgery. The way CAH affects the organism is complicated, and not everyone who has it will show signs or have symptoms. Individuals with CAH may face challenges related to growth impairment during childhood and fertility issues during adulthood. Psychosocial aspects such as gender identity development and mental health should also be taken into consideration when managing individuals with CAH. Overall prognosis for individuals with appropriate medical care is good; however, lifelong management under specialized care is required to ensure optimal outcomes.
Treatment for CAH involves hormone replacement therapy to provide adequate levels of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Regular monitoring is necessary to optimize hormone balance and minimize potential complications associated with long-term glucocorticoid exposure.

==Presentation==
CAH can occur in various forms. The clinical presentation of each form is different and depends to a large extent on the kind of the underlying 21-hydroxylase enzyme defect. Classical forms appear in infancy, and nonclassical forms appear in late childhood. The presentation in patients with classical CAH can be further subdivided into two forms: salt-wasting and simple-virilizing, depending on whether mineralocorticoid deficiency is present or absent, respectively. This subtyping is often not clinically meaningful, because all patients with classical form lose salt to some degree, and clinical presentations may overlap.

===Severe, early onset 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH===
The two most serious neonatal consequences of 21-hydroxylase deficiency are the following: life-threatening salt-wasting crises in the first month of life (for male and female infants alike) and severe virilization of female infants which can cause genital ambiguity. The subdivision of the early onset CAH into salt-wasting and simple-virilizing forms, which is based on the capacity of the adrenal to produce small amounts of aldosterone in the simple-virilizing form, is often not clinically meaningful, because clinical presentations overlap and all patients lose salt to some degree.

====Salt-wasting crises in infancy====
Excessive levels of androgens of adrenal origin have little effect on the genitals of male infants with classical CAH. If a male infant with CAH goes undetected during newborn screening, he will exhibit normal health and physical appearance upon examination, leading to his timely discharge from the hospital.

Aldosterone insufficiency in salt-wasting CAH results in a significant loss of sodium in the urine. Urinary sodium concentrations may exceed 50 mEq/L. Due to the loss of salt at that rate, the infant is unable to maintain proper blood volume and begins to suffer from dehydration due to hyponatremia by the end of the first week of life. Potassium and acid excretion are also impaired when mineralocorticoid activity is deficient, and hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis gradually develop. When there&#x27;s not enough cortisol in the body due to the classical CAH, it becomes harder to have proper blood circulation. Inadequate circulation can cause problems like spitting and difficulty gaining weight in babies. Furthermore, infants with salt-wasting CAH may experience even worse symptoms like vomiting, and extreme dehydration, and their circulation can suddenly fail (which is called circulatory shock) within two or three weeks after birth.

Upon admission to a medical facility, the infant between the ages of 1 and 3 weeks will exhibit signs of both underweight and dehydration. The blood pressure may be abnormally low.
Basic laboratory analyses will indicate low levels of sodium (hyponatremia), typically falling between 105 and 125 mEq/L Na+ in serum samples. These infants may also experience severe hyperkalemia with potassium (K+) levels exceeding 10 mEq/L, along with significant metabolic acidosis. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) might also be observed. This collection of manifestations is referred to as a &quot;salt-wasting crisis&quot; which poses an imminent risk of fatal consequences if left untreated.

Despite the severity of this condition, affected infants respond swiftly to treatment involving hydrocortisone administration along with intravenous infusion of saline solution and dextrose supplementation. Consequently, normal blood volume is promptly restored alongside stabilization of blood pressure and restoration of appropriate body sodium levels, leading to a reversal of hyperkalemia. With prompt and apt management measures in place, most infants are no longer at risk within a span of approximately 24 hours.

====Virilization of female infants====
CAH is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired production of cortisol in the adrenal glands.

Production of cortisol begins at week 8 of fetal life.

The 21-hydroxylase enzyme is essential in conversion of progesterone and 17OHP into 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively. This process is done through hydroxylation at C-21 position.
It was described in at least 1953 that impaired steroid hydroxylation at C-21 position happens in congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is accompanied by excessive amounts of 17OHP that leads to virilism.

In the insufficiency of 21-hydroxylase to participate in the biosynthesis of cortisol, the 21-hydroxylation in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex is impaired, so 17OHP and progesterone will not be properly converted into 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone, respectively − the precursors for cortisol and aldosterone. As the plasma concentration of cortisol and aldosterone decreases, ACTH levels increase, leading to excessive production and accumulation of cortisol precursors (especially 17OHP), which are eventually transferred to androsterone that is a feedstock for other androgens. Other androgens may be additionally produced from 17OHP, due to its elevated levels, that leads, inter alia, to its 5α-reduction. These additional androgens are produced via the so-called &quot;backdoor pathway&quot; (see red arrows on the diagram). For example, in this &quot;backdoor&quot; pathway, 5α-dihydrotestosterone is produced with roundabout of testosterone as an intermediate product. Some of the androgens produced by the backdoor pathway are those that cannot be converted to estrogens by aromatase, causing prenatal virilization, and making them the dominant androgens in classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Virilization of genetically female (XX) infants usually produces obvious genital ambiguity. Inside the pelvis, the ovaries are normal and since they have not been exposed to testicular anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), the uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and other Müllerian structures are normally formed as well. However, the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it opens at the base of the phallus, on the shaft or even at the tip like a boy. Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugate as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) in the folds.

Thus, depending on the severity of hyperandrogenism, a female infant can be mildly affected, obviously ambiguous, or so severely virilized as to appear to be a male. Andrea Prader devised the following Prader scale as a way of describing the degree of virilization.
* An infant at stage 1 has a mildly large clitoris and slightly reduced vaginal opening size. This degree may go unnoticed or may be simply assumed to be within normal variation.
* Stages 2 and 3 represent progressively more severe degrees of virilization. The genitalia are obviously abnormal to the eye, with a phallus intermediate in size and a small vaginal opening.
* Stage 4 looks more male than female, with an empty scrotum and a phallus the size of a normal penis, but not quite free enough of the perineum to be pulled onto the abdomen toward the umbilicus (i.e., what is termed a chordee in a male). The single small urethral/vaginal opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus would be considered a hypospadias in a male. X-rays taken after dye injection into this opening reveal the internal connection with the upper vagina and uterus. This common opening can predispose to urinary obstruction and infection.
* Stage 5 denotes complete male virilization, with a normally formed penis with the urethral opening at or near the tip. The scrotum is normally formed but empty. The internal pelvic organs include normal ovaries and uterus, and the vagina connects internally with the urethra as in Stage 4. These infants are not visibly ambiguous and are usually assumed to be ordinary boys with undescended testes. In most cases, the diagnosis of CAH is not suspected until signs of salt-wasting develop a week later.

When the genitalia are determined to be ambiguous at birth, CAH is one of the leading diagnostic possibilities. Evaluation reveals the presence of a uterus, extreme elevation of 17OHP, levels of testosterone approaching or exceeding the male range but low AMH levels. The karyotype is that of an ordinary female: 46, XX. With this information, the diagnosis of CAH is readily made and the female sex is confirmed.

Evaluation of ambiguous genitalia is described in detail elsewhere. In most cases, it is possible to confirm and assign female sex within 12–36 hours of birth. The exception is the rare, completely virilized genetic female (Prader stage 5), who presents the most challenging assignment and surgery dilemmas.

When the degree of ambiguity is obvious, corrective surgery is usually offered and performed, but reconstructive surgery on infant genitalia has controversies.

==== Reduced fertility ====

===== Testicular adrenal rest tumors =====
Infertility observed in adult males with classical CAH has been associated with testicular adrenal rest tumors (TART) that may originate during childhood. Delayed diagnosis of CAH was associated with a higher risk of developing TART, which may be attributable to poor disease control early in life, emphasizing the need of early detection and management of CAH, and, once CAH is detected, detection and management of TART. TART in prepubertal males with classical CAH could be found during childhood (20%). Martinez-Aguayo et al. reported differences in markers of gonadal function in a subgroup of patients, especially in those with inadequate control. Early glucocorticoid therapy may be beneficial to the reduction of TART. Early detection and management of TART in CAH patients is important for preserving testicular function and preventing long-term complications that may impact fertility, To avoid long-term complications in male patients with CAH, regular ultrasound examination of the scrotum is recommended, especially in patients presenting with the most profound phenotypes of CAH and suboptimal endocrine regulation of the condition. Subsequently, male subjects with nonclassic CAH rarely present with TARTs, and even though these tumors do not affect fertility and do not require regular ultrasound examination of the scrotum.

===== Female fertility =====
Women with classical CAH have statistically reduced fertility, especially those with the salt-losing form. Live birth rate is 33–50% in simple virilized form of CAH and 0–10% in most severe salt-wasting form. In the nonclassical form of CAH, the live birth is 63–90%, similar to the age-matched control groups.

====Sex assignment issues and controversies====
Classical CAH leads to female pseudohermaphroditism at birth, and is the most common cause of sex ambiguity, the second one is mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Most commonly, at birth, the phallus enlarges, so it is larger than a normal female but smaller than a normal male. Instead of separate urethral and vaginal openings, there is a urogenital sinus that is often covered by tissue resulting from the posterior fusion of the labioscrotal ridges. Therefore, different degrees of external genital abnormalities can be found, ranging from normal perineum to penile urethra.

There are no difficulties assigning appropriate sex for most infants with CAH. Genetic males have normal male genitalia and gonads and simply need hormone replacement. Most virilized females are assigned and raised as girls even if their genitalia are ambiguous or look more male than female. They have normal ovaries and uterus and potential fertility with hormone replacement and surgery. The complex issues encountered in appropriate sex assignment for severely virilized XX infants have contributed to a deeper understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation. Consequently, this matter remains an ongoing subject of debate within medical discourse.

Until the 1950s, some virilized XX infants were assigned and raised as girls, and some as boys. Most developed gender identities are congruent with their sex of rearing. In a few cases of male rearing, a sex reassignment was attempted in mid-childhood when newly discovered karyotyping revealed &quot;female&quot; chromosomes. These reassignments were rarely successful, leading New Zealand American psychologist John Money and other influential psychologists and physicians to conclude that gender identity was (1) unrelated to chromosomes, (2) primarily a result of social learning, and (3) could not be easily changed after infancy.

By the 1960s, CAH was well understood, karyotyping was routine, and standard management was to assign and raise all children with CAH according to their gonads and karyotypes, no matter how virilized. Markedly virilized girls were usually referred to a pediatric surgeon, often a pediatric urologist for a reconstructive vaginoplasty and clitoral reduction or recession—surgery to create or enlarge a vaginal opening and reduce the size or protrusion of the clitoris. This approach was designed to preserve fertility for both sexes and remains the standard management, but two aspects of this management have been challenged: assignment of completely virilized genetic females and the value and age of corrective surgery.

The first questions about assignment were raised in the early 1980s when Money and others reported an unexpectedly high rate of failure to achieve normal adult sexual relationships (i.e., heterosexual orientation, marriage, and children) in grown women with CAH (though all had female gender identities). However, the sample was small, and results seemed interpretable in many ways: selection bias, early hormone effects on orientation, or sexual dysfunction created by residual body abnormalities or by the genital surgery itself. From a perspective two decades later, the report was one of the first pieces of evidence that the standard management paradigm was not always producing hoped-for outcomes.

Despite these concerns, no significant opposition to standard management arose until the mid-1990s, when a confluence of evidence and opinion from several sources led to a re-examination of outcomes. Several intersex support and advocacy groups (e.g., the Intersex Society of North America) began to publicly criticize infant genital surgery based on unsatisfactory outcomes of some adults who had been operated on as infants. Their complaints were that they had a reduced ability to enjoy sexual relations or that they resented not having had the choice of gender assignment or surgical reconstruction left until they were old enough to participate. 

In 1997, influential articles by Reiner, Diamond, and Sigmundson advocated &quot;consideration&quot; of (1) male sex assignment in the unambiguously male XX infants (most of whom are considered male until the CAH is recognized at 1–2 weeks of age), and (2) delaying reconstructive surgery until the patient is old enough to participate in the decision.

Although the standard management approach remains &quot;standard&quot;, more time and consideration are being given in many cases to explaining alternatives to parents and a small number of XX children with unambiguously male external genitalia are again being raised as boys.

===Late onset (nonclassical) CAH===
In the milder, nonclassical form of CAH, the androgen excess is subtle enough that virilization is not apparent or goes unrecognized at birth and in early childhood. However, androgen levels are above normal and slowly rise during childhood, producing noticeable effects between 2 and 9 years of age.

The appearance of pubic hair in mid-childhood is the most common feature that leads to evaluation and diagnosis of the late onset (nonclassical) CAH. Other accompanying features are likely to be tall stature and accelerated bone age (often 3–5 years ahead). Often present are increased muscle mass, acne, and adult body odor. In boys, the penis will be enlarged. Mild clitoral enlargement may occur in girls, and sometimes a degree of prenatal virilization is recognized that may have gone unnoticed in infancy.

The principal goals of treatment of nonclassical CAH are to preserve as much growth as possible and to prevent central precocious puberty if it has not already been triggered. These are more difficult challenges than in CAH detected in infancy because moderate levels of androgens will have had several years to advance bone maturation and to trigger central puberty before the disease is detected.

A diagnosis of nonclassical CAH is usually confirmed by discovering extreme elevations of 17OHP along with moderately high testosterone levels. A cosyntropin stimulation test may be needed in mild cases, but usually, the random levels of 17OHP are high enough to confirm the diagnosis.

Elevated 17OHP may activate the androgen &quot;backdoor&quot; pathway, that leads to an excess of 5α-dihydrotestosterone and other potent androgens.

The mainstay of treatment for symptoms of hyperandrogenism is suppression of androgens of adrenal origin by a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone. Mineralocorticoid is only added in cases where the plasma renin activity is high. Most patients that have the nonclassic form do not require any glucocorticoid replacement therapy, as cortisol synthesis impairment is mild but clinically silent. Patients usually have the same baseline but lower peak cortisol levels compared to healthy controls. The exact degree of cortisol synthesis impairment depends on the genotype.

An important aspect of managing nonclassic CAH is the suppression of central precocious puberty if it has begun. The usual clues to central puberty in boys are that the testes are pubertal in size, or that androgens of adrenal origin remain elevated even when the 17OHP has been reduced toward normal. In girls central puberty is less often a problem, but breast development would be the main clue. Central precocious puberty is suppressed when appropriate by leuprolide.

As outlined above, recent additions to treatment to preserve growth include aromatase inhibition to slow bone maturation by reducing the amount of testosterone converted to estradiol, and the use of blockers of estrogen for the same purpose.

Once adrenal suppression has been achieved, the patient needs stress steroid coverage as described above for significant illness or injury.

Many variants of the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene result in various degrees of hyperandrogenism, some of which may be so mild that they may not even cause problems in males and may not be recognized until adolescence or later in females. Mild androgen effects in young women may include hirsutism, acne, or anovulation (which in turn can cause infertility). Testosterone levels in these women may be mildly elevated, or simply above average. Despite the prevailing notion that testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are the primary human androgens, this notion only applies to healthy men. Although testosterone has been traditionally used as a biomarker of hyperandrogenism, it correlates poorly with clinical measurements of androgen excess. While testosterone levels can appear normal, ignoring the alternative androgen pathways may lead to diagnostic errors since hyperandrogenism may be caused by potent androgens such as DHT produced by a backdoor pathway and 11-oxygenated androgens.
It may be that 11-ketotestosterone is the main androgen in women since it circulates at a similar level to testosterone and may or may not decline with age as testosterone does. While 11-ketodihydrotestosterone (11KDHT) is equipotent to DHT, circulating levels of 11KDHT are lower than DHT. Unlike testosterone and androstenedione, 11-oxygenated androgens are not known to be aromatized to estrogens in the human body.

These clinical features are those of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and a small percentage of women with PCOS are found to have late-onset CAH when investigated. Late-onset CAH is often misdiagnosed as PCOS.

Late-onset CAH is often diagnosed in the context of infertility assessment in women. Diagnosis of late-onset CAH may be suspected from a high 17OHP level, but some cases are so mild that the elevation is only demonstrable after cosyntropin stimulation. Treatment may involve a combination of very low dose glucocorticoid to reduce adrenal androgen production and any of various agents to block the androgen effects and/or induce ovulation. During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, progesterone accumulates along with 17OHP which can thin the endometrium and change cervical mucus like the effect of progestogen contraceptives, interferes with the normal menstrual cycle, which can lead to oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and impairs sperm penetration. Abnormal endometrial development leads to decreased uterine receptivity, which also contributes to infertility. Once attempting to conceive, most women with late-onset CAH will become pregnant within a year with or without treatment, but they have an increased risk of miscarriage.

Late onset CAH was originally characterized in 1957 by French biochemist Jacques Decourt, but the association with mild 21-hydroxylase deficiency called nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is characterized by diverse hyperandrogenic symptoms appearing postnatally in males and females, was first described in 1979 by Maria New. New since then have studied ways to reduce androgen excess and found out that treatment with dexamethasone 0.25 mg orally every evening reversed acne and irregular menstruation in 3 months, but hirsutism required up to 30 months. Dexamethasone has glucocorticoid activity, and potent ACTH-suppression properties within the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Lower ACTH leads to reduced production of all the steroids, including androgens. According to 2018 Clinical Practice Guideline, glucocorticoid treatment is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals, however, if the symptoms of androgen excess are sufficient, dexamethasone treatment may be prescribed. Another treatment option is oral contraceptive pills.

==Genetics==
The &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene for the P450c21 enzyme (also known as 21-hydroxylase) is at 6p21.3, amid genes &quot;HLA B&quot; and &quot;HLA DR&quot; coding for the major human histocompatibility loci (HLA). The protein-coding &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene may be accompanied by one or several copies of the nonfunctional pseudogene &quot;CYP21A1P&quot;. Scores of abnormal alleles of &quot;CYP21A2&quot; have been documented, most arising from recombinations of homologous regions of &quot;CYP21A2&quot; and &quot;CYP21A1P&quot;. The 21-hydroxylase deficiency may be caused by macrodeletions of about 30 Kb, which includes not only most of the 5′ region of the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene, but also all of the &quot;C4B&quot; gene and 3′ regions of the &quot;CYP21A1P&quot; pseudogene. Duplications of &quot;CYP21A1P&quot; pseudogene and &quot;C4B&quot; gene are often associated with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Due to the high degree of homology between the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene and the &quot;CYP21A1P&quot; pseudogene, and the complexity of the locus, research on the molecular level is difficult.

Differences in residual enzyme activity of the various alleles account for the various degrees of severity of the disease. Inheritance of all forms of 21-hydroxylase CAH is autosomal recessive, except some mild disease-causing variants such as p.V281L that seem to exert dominant negative effects on enzymatic activity.

Persons affected by any form of the disease have two abnormal alleles, and both parents are usually heterozygotes (or carriers). When both parents carry an abnormal allele, each child has a 25% chance of having the disease, a 50% chance of being a carrier like the parents, and a 25% chance of having two normal genes.

It is possible to test for heterozygosity by measuring 17OHP elevation after ACTH stimulation.

More than 200 disease-causing variants within the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene have been identified so far that lead to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Most patients have at least two of these variants present as compound heterozygous.

There are some mild disease-causing variants that seem to exert dominant negative effects on enzymatic activity, even if present as single heterozygous. One example is a point mutation in exon 7 of &quot;CYP21A2&quot;, (p.V281L), which is commonly found in LOCAH-associated alleles. Carriers for this mutation retain 20%–50% of 21-hydroxylase activity, but are at higher risk of symptoms of androgen excess than carriers of the severe mutations, and had higher adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulated 17OHP, suggesting that the mutant protein V281L enzyme co-expressed with the wild-type (healthy) enzyme resulted in an apparent dominant negative effect on the enzymatic activity.

There is a good correlation between the genotype and phenotype. As a result, the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; genotyping has high diagnostic value. However, the genotyping of the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene is prone to errors, especially due to the closely located and highly homologous pseudogene &quot;CYP21A1P&quot; and the complex duplications, deletions, and rearrangements within chromosome 6p21.3. That is why &quot;CYP21A2&quot; genotyping, interpretation of the results, and adequate genetic counseling for patients and their families requires deep understanding of &quot;CYP21A2&quot; genetics.
The &quot;CYP21A1P&quot; pseudogene retains 98% exonic sequence identity with the functional gene &quot;CYP21A2&quot;, and the high degree of sequence similarity between them indicates that these two genes are evolving in tandem through intergenic exchange of DNA. Both genes are located on chromosome 6, in the major histocompatibility complex III (MHC class III) close to the Complement component 4 genes &quot;C4A&quot; and &quot;C4B&quot;, the Tenascin X gene &quot;TNXB&quot; and &quot;STK19&quot;. MHC class III is the most gene-dense region of the human genome, containing many genes that yet have unknown function or structure.

The &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene is located within the RCCX cluster (an abbreviation composed of the names of the genes &quot;RP&quot; (a former name for &quot;STK19&quot; serine/threonine kinase 19), &quot;C4&quot;, &quot;CYP21&quot; and &quot;TNX&quot;), which is the most complex gene cluster in the human genome. The number of RCCX segments varies between one and four in a chromosome, with the prevalence of approximately 15% for monomodular, 75% for bimodular (&quot;STK19-C4A-CYP21A1P-TNXA-STK19B-C4B-CYP21A2-TNXB&quot;), and 10% for trimodular in Europeans. The quadrimodular structure of the RCCX unit is very rare. In a monomodular structure, all of the genes are functional i.e. protein-coding, but if a module count is two or more, there is only one copy of each functional gene rest being non-coding pseudogenes except the &quot;C4&quot; gene which always has active copies.

Due to the high degree of homology between the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene and the &quot;CYP21P1&quot; pseudogene and the complexity of the locus, it is difficult to study the &quot;CYP21A2&quot; gene at the molecular level, giving sometimes inaccurate or inconclusive results. The targeted long-read sequencing method aims to improve the accuracy of the findings, however, the clinical use of this method is limited.

The &quot;cryptic&quot; form of (CAH) refers to a condition in which an individual is genetically determined to have the nonclassic variant of CAH but does not display any obvious symptoms. The term &quot;cryptic&quot; is used due to the lack of symptomatology in these individuals. Most males and some females with nonclassic CAH do not exhibit clinical signs or symptoms. However, the exact prevalence of asymptomatic individuals among those genetically identified with nonclassic CAH is currently unknown. Therefore, it is also uncertain what proportion of this population represents the cryptic form of CAH.
==Pathophysiology==

The enzyme P450c21, commonly referred to as 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), is embedded in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the cells of the adrenal cortex. It catalyzes hydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol in the glucocorticoid pathway, which starts from pregnenolone and finishes with cortisol. It also catalyzes hydroxylation of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) in the mineralocorticoid pathway on its way from pregnenolone to aldosterone.

Deficient activity of this enzyme reduces the efficiency of cortisol synthesis, with consequent hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and elevation of ACTH levels. ACTH stimulates the uptake of cholesterol and the synthesis of pregnenolone. Steroid precursors up to and including progesterone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and especially 17OHP accumulate in the adrenal cortex and circulating blood. Blood levels of 17OHP can reach 10-1000 times the normal concentration.

Since 21-hydroxylase activity is not involved in the synthesis of androgens, a substantial fraction of the large amounts of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone is diverted to the synthesis of DHEA, androstenedione, and other androgens of adrenal origin beginning in the third month of fetal life in both sexes.

Synthesis of aldosterone is also dependent on 21-hydroxylase activity. Although fetal production is impaired, it causes no prenatal effects, as the placental connection allows maternal blood to &quot;dialyze&quot; the fetus and maintain both electrolyte balance and blood volume.

==Diagnosis==
Since CAH is an autosomal recessive disease, most children with CAH are born to parents unaware of the risk and with no family history. Each child will have a 25% chance of being born with the disease.

===Classification===
The condition can be classified into &quot;salt-wasting&quot;, &quot;simple virilizing&quot;, and &quot;nonclassical&quot; forms.

The salt-wasting and simple virilizing types are sometimes grouped as &quot;classical&quot;.

===Newborn screening===
Conditions justifying newborn screening for any disorder include (1) a simple test with an acceptable sensitivity and specificity, (2) a dire consequence if not diagnosed early, (3) an effective treatment if diagnosed, and (4) a frequency in the population high enough to justify the expense. In the last decade, more states and countries have adopted newborn screening for salt-wasting CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which leads to death in the first month of life if not recognized.

The salt-wasting form of CAH has an incidence of 1 in 15,000 births and is potentially fatal within a month if untreated. Steroid replacement is a simple, effective treatment. However, the screening test itself is less than perfect, because of low specificity and high levels of false positives, meaning that the tests sometimes give incorrect results, saying the baby has CAH when they actually do not. This can make the family worried and spend money unnecessarily on hospital visits and extra tests that are not needed. For the newborn screening, levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) are typically measured against predetermined cutoff, which depends on the measurement method. While the 17OHP level is easy to measure and sensitive (rarely missing real cases), the test has a poorer specificity, giving high rates of false positives. Screening programs in the United States have reported that 99% of positive screens turn out to be false positives upon investigation of the infant. This is a higher rate of false positives than the screening tests for many other congenital metabolic diseases.

Measurement 17OHP by LC-MS/MS reduces the false positive rate in newborn screening compared to measurement by immunoassays. 17OHP steroid precursors and their sulphated conjugates which are present in the first two days after birth in healthy infants and longer in pre-term neonates, cross-react in immunoassays with 17OHP, giving falsely high 17OHP levels.

When a positive result is detected, the infant must be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist to confirm or disprove the diagnosis. Since most infants with salt-wasting CAH become critically ill by 2 weeks of age, the evaluation must be done rapidly despite the high false positive rate.

Levels of 17OHP, androstenedione, and cortisol may play a role in screening.

===Additional markers===
While 17OHP with or without ACTH stimulation is the main marker for 21-hydroxylase deficiency, other markers have been proposed, with various degrees of acceptance:
* 21-Deoxycortisol is elevated in 21-hydroxylase deficiency. However, it is not elevated in preterm infants or in other forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Unlike 17OHP, 21-deoxycortisol is not produced in the gonads and is uniquely adrenal-derived. Consequently, 21-deoxycortisol it is a more specific marker of the 21-hydroxylase deficiency than 17OHP. Even so, 21-deoxycortisol measurement has not been commonly performed by laboratories until 2019. Still, 21-deoxycortisol can be a key screening marker for 21-hydroxylase deficiency in newborn screening.
* 21-Deoxycorticosterone, also known as 11β-hydroxyprogesterone (11β-OHP), have been proposed as a marker in 1987. A study in 2017 has shown that in subjects with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, serum 11β-OHP concentrations range from 0.012 to 3.37 ng/mL, while in control group it was below detection limit of 0.012 ng/mL. This marker did not gain acceptance due to the fact that the test for the levels of this steroid is not routinely offered by diagnostic laboratories.
* Progesterone levels are higher in CAH subjects. A study has revealed that serum progesterone concentrations in boys (10 days to 18 years old) with 21-hydroxylase deficiency reached levels up to 10.14 ng/mL, i.e. similar to female luteal values, while in the control group of boys, average level was 0.07 ng/mL (0.22 nmol/L), with values ranging from 0.05 to 0.40 ng/mL. The authors of the study propose to use progesterone as an additional marker for 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The study shows that the progesterone levels in CAH and non-CAH females are the same as in CAH and non-CAH males respectively – it is the condition that affects progesterone levels, not the sex, but for women between menarche and menopause, progesterone should be measured in days 3–5 of the cycle to have diagnostic value – the same condition also applies for 17OHP. The specificity of progesterone as a marker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, as opposed to deficiency of other enzymes involved in steroid pathways, is still not well studied.
* Cortisol is one of the two main final products of 21-hydroxylase, and the deficiency of this enzyme may lead to a certain degree of cortisol deficiency. Cortisol levels are lower in CAH subjects, on average, however, in milder cases cortisol levels can be normal, but, this has not been yet well studied. Cortisol measurement using immunoassays is prone to cross-reactivity with various substances including 21-deoxycortisol that raises due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, leading to falsely high cortisol levels when the true cortisol is actually low. The selectivity offered by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has largely overcome these limitations. As a result, the use of LC-MS/MS instead of immunoassays in cortisol measurement aims to provide greater specificity.
* 11-Deoxycortisol is a direct product of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, with 21-hydroxylase catalyzing the reaction, and an intermediate product towards the cortisol pathway. Reduced 21-hydroxylase activity leads to decreased levels of 11-deoxycortisol, but not all laboratories specify a minimum reference value it since it is mostly used as a biomarker for 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, where 11-deoxycortisol levels increase dramatically, so the laboratories may only specify the maximum reference value.

==Treatment==
===Prenatal treatment===
Clinical Practice Guidelines advise that clinicians continue to regard prenatal therapy as experimental.

Because the period during which fetal genitalia may become virilized begins about 6 weeks after conception, prenatal treatment to avoid virilization must be started by 6 to 7 weeks.

==== Application of dexamethasone in prenatal treatment ====
Adrenal glands of female fetuses with CAH begin producing excess androgens by the 9th week of gestation. The most important aspects of virilization (urogenital closure and phallic urethra) occur between 8 and 12 weeks. Theoretically, if enough glucocorticoid could be supplied to the fetus to reduce adrenal androgen biosynthesis by the 9th week, virilization could be prevented and the difficult decision about timing of surgery avoided.

The challenge of preventing severe virilization of girls is twofold: detection of CAH at the beginning of the pregnancy, and delivery of an effective amount of glucocorticoid to the fetus without causing harm to the mother.

The first problem has not yet been entirely solved, but it has been shown that if dexamethasone is taken by a pregnant woman, enough can cross the placenta to suppress fetal adrenal function.

At present no program screens for risk in families who have not yet had a child with CAH. For families desiring to avoid virilization of a second child, the current strategy is to start dexamethasone as soon as a pregnancy has been confirmed even though at that point the chance that the pregnancy is a girl with CAH is only 12.5%. Dexamethasone is taken by the mother each day until it can be safely determined whether she is carrying an affected girl.

Whether the fetus is an affected girl can be determined by chorionic villus sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by amniocentesis at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex can be determined quickly, and if the fetus is a male the dexamethasone can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed to see if she carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the &quot;CYP21&quot; gene. If so, dexamethasone is continued for the remainder of the pregnancy at a dose of about 1 mg daily.

Most mothers who have followed this treatment plan have experienced at least mild cushingoid effects from the glucocorticoid but have borne daughters whose genitalia are much less virilized.

Dexamethasone is used as an off-label early prenatal treatment for the symptoms of CAH in female fetuses, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. A 2007 Swedish clinical trial found that treatment may cause cognitive and behavioural defects, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive. A 2012 American study found no negative short-term outcomes, but &quot;lower cognitive processing in CAH girls and women with long-term dexamethasone exposure.&quot; Administration of pre-natal dexamethasone has been the subject of controversy over issues of informed consent and because treatment must predate a clinical diagnosis of CAH in the female fetus, especially because in utero dexamethasone may cause metabolic problems that are not evident until later in life; Swedish clinics ceased recruitment for research in 2010.

The treatment has also raised concerns in LGBT and bioethics communities following the publication of an essay posted to the forum of the Hastings Center, and research in the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, which found that pre-natal treatment of female fetuses was suggested to prevent those fetuses from becoming lesbians after birth, may make them more likely to engage in &quot;traditionally&quot; female-identified behaviour and careers, and more interested in bearing and raising children. Citing a known attempt by a man using his knowledge of the fraternal birth order effect to avoid having a homosexual son by using a surrogate, the essayists (Professor Alice Dreger of Northwestern University&#x27;s Feinberg School of Medicine, Professor Ellen Feder of American University and attorney Anne Tamar-Mattis) suggest that prenatal dexamethasone treatments constitute the first known attempt to use &quot;in utero&quot; protocols to reduce the incidence of homosexuality and bisexuality in humans. Research on the use of prenatal hormone treatments to prevent homosexuality stretches back to the early 1990s or earlier.

Since CAH is a recessive gene, both the mother and father must be recessive carriers of CAH for a child to have CAH. Due to advances in modern medicine, those couples with the recessive CAH genes have an option to prevent CAH in their offspring through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In PGD, the egg is fertilized outside the woman&#x27;s body in a Petri dish (IVF). On the 3rd day, when the embryo has developed from one cell to about 4 to 6 cells, one of those cells is removed from the embryo without harming the embryo. The embryo continues to grow until day 5 when it is either frozen or implanted into the mother. Meanwhile, the removed cell is analyzed to determine if the embryo has CAH. If the embryo is determined to have CAH, the parents may decide as to whether they wish to have it implanted in the mother or not.

Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found &quot;less than one half of one percent of published &#x27;studies&#x27; of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality ... in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics&quot; and &quot;there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone&quot;.

===Long-term management of CAH===
Management of infants and children with CAH is complex and warrants long-term care in a pediatric endocrine clinic. After the diagnosis is confirmed, and any salt-wasting crisis averted or reversed, major management issues include:

# Initiating and monitoring hormone replacement
# Stress coverage, crisis prevention, parental education
# Reconstructive surgery
# Optimizing growth
# Optimizing androgen suppression and fertility in women with CAH

Management of adults with CAH should take into consideration the side effects of long-term glucocorticoid exposure, such as cardiovascular morbidities.

====Hormone replacement====
The primary goals of hormone replacement are to protect from adrenal insufficiency and to suppress the excessive adrenal androgen production.

Glucocorticoids are provided to all children and adults with all but the mildest and latest-onset forms of CAH. The glucocorticoids provide a reliable substitute for cortisol, thereby reducing ACTH levels. Reducing ACTH also reduces the stimulus for continued hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens. In other words, glucocorticoid replacement is the primary method of reducing the excessive adrenal androgen production in both sexes. A number of glucocorticoids are available for therapeutic use. Hydrocortisone or liquid prednisolone is preferred in infancy and childhood, and prednisone or dexamethasone are often more convenient for adults.

The glucocorticoid dose is typically started at the low end of physiologic replacement (6–12 mg/m2) but is adjusted throughout childhood to prevent both growth suppression from too much glucocorticoid and androgen escape from too little. Serum levels of 17OHP, testosterone, androstenedione, and other adrenal steroids are followed for additional information, but may not be entirely normalized even with optimal treatment. As regular monitoring is needed, patients can be monitored non-invasively by measuring 17OHP and androstenedione in saliva. (&quot;See Glucocorticoid for more on this topic.&quot;) However, the currently used glucocorticoid therapy methods may lead to unphysiological doses that, in addition to the problems caused by overexposure to androgens, can harm health. Various clinical results, besides the steroids, require regular monitoring. The negative consequences are primarily the result of non-physiological glucocorticoid replacement. During illness or physical or mental stress, the demand for cortisol can increase, sometimes leading to adrenal crises. As current glucocorticoid therapy regiments fail to replicate the physiologic circadian rhythm and the glucocorticoids are often administered at a higher dose to treat androgen excess, the long-term consequences of the therapy, such as decreased bone density and an increased cardiometabolic risk profile, should be addressed; other consequences of CAH such as impaired quality of life and affected mental health should be taken into consideration; periodic assessments and monitoring of patients should take place in specialized centers to detect and treat potential complications early. Clinical studies are underway to find ways to better mimic the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion and to reduce the total dose of glucocorticoids.

Mineralocorticoids are replaced in all infants with salt-wasting and in most patients with elevated renin levels. Fludrocortisone is the only pharmaceutically available mineralocorticoid and is usually used in doses of 0.05 to 2 mg daily. Electrolytes, renin, and blood pressure levels are followed to optimize the dose.

=====Stress coverage, crisis prevention, parental education=====
Even after diagnosis and initiation of treatment, a small percentage of children and adults with infancy or childhood-onset CAH die of adrenal crisis. Deaths from this are entirely avoidable if the child and family understand that the daily glucocorticoids cannot be allowed to be interrupted by an illness. When a person is well, missing a dose, or even several doses, may produce little in the way of immediate symptoms. However, glucocorticoid needs are increased during illness and stress, and missed doses during an illness such as the ifluenza or viral gastroenteritis can lead within hours to reduced blood pressure, shock, and death.

To prevent this, all persons taking replacement glucocorticoids are taught to increase their doses in the event of illness, surgery, severe injury, or severe exhaustion. More importantly, they are taught that vomiting warrants an injection within hours of hydrocortisone (e.g., SoluCortef) or another glucocorticoid. This recommendation applies to both children and adults. Because young children are more susceptible to vomiting illnesses than adults, pediatric endocrinologists usually teach parents how to give hydrocortisone injections.

As an additional precaution, persons with adrenal insufficiency are advised to wear a medical identification tag or carry a wallet card to alert those who may be providing emergency medical care of the urgent need for glucocorticoids.

====Reconstructive surgery====
Surgery need never be considered for genetically male (XY) infants because the excess androgens do not produce anatomic abnormality. However, surgery for severely virilized XX infants is often performed and has become a subject of debate.

Surgical reconstruction of abnormal genitalia has been offered to parents of severely virilized girls with CAH since the first half of the 20th century. The purposes of surgery have generally been a combination of the following:

# To make the external genitalia look more female than male;
# To make it possible for these girls to participate in normal sexual intercourse when they grow up;
# To improve their chances of fertility;
# To reduce the frequency of urinary infections.

In the 1950s and 1960s, surgery often involved clitorectomy (removal of most of the clitoris), an operation that also reduced genital sensation. In the 1970s, new operative methods were developed to preserve innervation and clitoral function. However, several retrospective surveys in the last decade suggest that (1) sexual enjoyment is reduced in many women even after nerve-sparing procedures, and (2) women with CAH who have not had surgery also have a substantial rate of sexual dysfunction. (&quot;See Intersex surgery for an overview of procedures and potential complications, and History of intersex surgery for a fuller discussion of the controversies.&quot;) Many patient advocates and surgeons argue for deferring surgery until adolescence or later, while some surgeons continue to argue that infant surgery has advantages.

====Optimizing growth in CAH====
It is unclear what concentration of adrenal androgens is best for normal growth, puberty, and bone health.

One of the challenging aspects of long-term management is optimizing growth so that a child with CAH achieves his or her height potential because both undertreatment and overtreatment can reduce growth or the remaining time for growth. While glucocorticoids are essential for health, dosing is always a matter of approximation. In even mildly excessive amounts, glucocorticoids slow growth. On the other hand, adrenal androgens are readily converted to estradiol, which accelerates bone maturation and can lead to early epiphyseal closure. This narrow target of optimal dose is made more difficult to obtain by the imperfect replication of normal diurnal plasma cortisol levels produced by 2 or 3 oral doses of hydrocortisone. As a consequence, average height losses of about 4 inches (10 cm) have been reported with traditional management.

Traditionally, pediatric endocrinologists have tried to optimize growth by measuring a child every few months to assess current rate of growth, by checking the bone age every year or two, by periodically measuring 17OHP and testosterone levels as indicators of adrenal suppression, and by using hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement rather than longer-acting prednisone or dexamethasone.

The growth problem is even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are detected when premature pubic hair appears in childhood because the bone age is often several years advanced at the age of diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.

In recent years some newer approaches to optimizing growth have been researched and are beginning to be used. It is possible to reduce the effects of androgens on the body by blocking the receptors with an antiandrogen such as flutamide and by reducing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This conversion is mediated by aromatase and can be inhibited by aromatase blockers such as testolactone. Blocking the effects and conversions of estrogens will allow the use of lower doses of glucocorticoids with less risk of acceleration of bone maturation. Other proposed interventions have included bilateral adrenalectomy to remove the androgen sources, or growth hormone treatment to enhance growth.

====Preventing hyperandrogenism and optimizing fertility====
As growth ends, management in girls with CAH changes focus to optimizing reproductive function. Both excessive androgens from the adrenals and excessive glucocorticoid treatment can disrupt ovulation, resulting in irregularity of menses or amenorrhea, as well as infertility. Continued monitoring of hormone balance and careful readjustment of glucocorticoid dose can usually restore fertility, but as a group, women with CAH have a lower fertility rate than a comparable population.

Classical CAH has little effect on male fertility unless an adult stops taking his glucocorticoid medication entirely for an extended time, in which case excessive adrenal androgens may reduce testicular production as well as spermatogenesis. Regarding nonclassic CAH, glucocorticoid therapy is typically not necessary for lifelong management. However, in certain cases, this treatment may be required to address fertility issues such as oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, or difficulty conceiving. About 90% of women with nonclassic CAH remain undiagnosed. Once attempting to conceive, approximately 83% of women win nonclassic CAH successfully achieve pregnancy within one year, irrespective of whether they receive glucocorticoid therapy or not, but the therapy reduces the risk of miscarriage.

====Psychosexual development and issues====
Nearly all mammals display sex-dimorphic reproductive and sexual behavior (e.g., lordosis and mounting in rodents). Much research has made it clear that prenatal and early postnatal androgens play a role in the differentiation of most mammalian brains. Experimental manipulation of androgen levels in utero or shortly after birth can alter adult reproductive behavior.

Girls and women with CAH constitute the majority of genetic females with normal internal reproductive hormones who have been exposed to male levels of androgens throughout their prenatal lives. Milder degrees of continuing androgen exposure continue throughout childhood and adolescence as a consequence of the imperfections of current glucocorticoid treatment for CAH. The psychosexual development of these girls and women has been analyzed as evidence of the role of androgens in human sex-dimorphic behaviors.

In comparison to unaffected individuals, patients with classical CAH exhibit a greater prevalence of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, alcohol misuse, personality disorders, and suicidal tendencies in males, while females are more prone to adjustment disorders. In comparison to the general population, individuals with CAH have a higher prevalence of substance abuse and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This is particularly observed in females with the most severe null genotype and males who receive a diagnosis after the neonatal period.

Girls with CAH have repeatedly been reported to spend more time with &quot;sex-atypical&quot; toys and &quot;rough-and-tumble&quot; play than unaffected sisters. These differences continue into adolescence, as expressed in social behaviors, leisure activities, and career interests. Interest in babies and becoming mothers is significantly lower by most measures. Avoidance of romantic relationships is common in women and men with classical CAH.

Gender identity of girls and women with CAH is most frequently observed to be female. Sexual orientation is more mixed, though the majority are heterosexual. In one study, 27% of women with CAH were rated as bisexual in their orientations.

A 2020 survey of 57 females with life-long experience of CAH and 132 parents of females with CAH in the United States revealed that the majority of participants do not consider females with CAH to be intersex, and oppose a legal intersex designation of females with CAH.

Cognitive effects are less clear. Altered fetal and postnatal exposure to androgens, as well as glucocorticoid therapy, affect brain development and function. Compared to healthy girls, those with classical CAH have more aggressive behavior but better spatial navigation abilities, and the amygdala activation patterns differ between affected and healthy girls. Glucocorticoid therapy in CAH impairs working memory and causes brain changes, including white matter hyperintensities, suggesting a reduction in white matter structural integrity. Cognitive impairment, when observed, has occasionally been attributed to hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalances at the initial presentation. A 2023 population-based cohort study of 714 patients with classical CAH and 71400 control subjects predict that patients with CAH have an increased prevalence of injuries and accidents, especially females, but the cause is not known.

The increased prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders, along with the prescription of antidepressants by medical practitioners, among youth with CAH in comparison to the general population indicates the potential necessity for screening for symptoms of depression and anxiety in this specific population.

Given that people with CAH exhibit a higher incidence and severity of behavioral symptoms, and that the manifestation of these behavioral problems can be attributed to excessive endogenous androgen exposure and side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, emphasis should be placed on early optimization of CAH management to mitigate the psychological ramifications that may ensue.

==Prognosis==
The outcomes and prognosis for CAH (Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia) can vary depending on several factors, such as the specific type of CAH, its severity, early detection, and proper management. With appropriate medical care and ongoing treatment, individuals with CAH can lead healthy lives. Consistent monitoring and adherence to treatment are crucial for optimal outcomes.

Children with CAH often experience increased height during early childhood, but their final adult height tends to be shorter than expected. Advanced bone age and early fusion of growth plates due to excess androgens contribute to this outcome. Additionally, glucocorticoid treatment for CAH can affect growth and result in decreased final height. Experimental treatments using growth hormone and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs have shown some success in increasing average height gains by approximately 7.3 cm. Most children with CAH have normal neuropsychological development, although there may be differences in gendered play activities influenced by prenatal sex steroid exposure.

While bone density is typically normal in most patients, metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid levels), and polycystic ovarian syndrome are more prevalent either due to the disease itself or long-term glucocorticoid treatment.

Fertility is possible for both males and females with CAH but may be reduced due to multiple factors encompassing biology, psychology, social influences, and sexual aspects.

Management of CAH requires collaboration among different subspecialty professionals considering the complex nature of the disease&#x27;s complications and long-term consequences.

==Incidence and variants==

According to most studies, the global incidence of classical forms ranges from about 1:14,000 to 1:18,000 births, based on newborn screening programs and national case registries, but this situation is more common in small genetically isolated populations with small gene pools. 10% of patients with classical forms of CAH have CAH-X syndrome, which is marked by the presence of CAH features along with features indicative of hypermobility-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This condition results from a contiguous gene deletion that impacts both &quot;CYP21A2&quot; and &quot;TNXB&quot; genes.

The incidence of nonclassical forms of CAH is 1:200 to 1:1000 based on various estimates, and is also higher in groups of people with a high rate of marriage between relatives, up to 1:50. Nonclassic CAH may be identified incidentally during the assessment of oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility in females. However, a significant proportion, approximately 90%, of women with nonclassic CAH remain undiagnosed. As for men with nonclassic CAH, their asymptomatic nature commonly leads to underdiagnosis.

== History ==
In 19th Century, cases of CAH were reported, leading to the understanding that the adrenal gland influenced sexual phenotypes as well as being mysteriously required for survival.

In 1865, CAH in its non-salt-wasting form was thoroughly described for the first time by a Neapolitan pathologist Luigi De Crecchio. However, significant strides in understanding and treating the condition have been made over the years.

In the early 20th Century, numerous adrenal steroids were isolated, and bioassays eventually distinguished glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens.

In 1950, Wilkins, Bartter, and Albright revolutionized clinical endocrinology with the use of cortisone to treat CAH and ushered in a productive era of pediatric adrenal research. Through careful clinical research, Wilkins established modern methods of treating CAH.

In 1957, Alfred Bongiovanni noticed a defect in 21-hydroxylation in CAH, followed by defects in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 11β-hydroxylase.

P450 enzymes were described from 1962 to 1964, and 21-hydroxylation was the first identified activity of P450s.

In the last quarter of the 20th Century, notable scholars who have contributed to the development of CAH knowledge include Hans Selye, who studied stress responses and adrenal function, as well as Maria New, who conducted extensive research on prenatal treatment options for CAH.

From 1984 to 2004, the techniques of molecular genetics were applied to elucidate the genetic and biochemical bases of CAH.

== Society and culture ==
Society&#x27;s understanding of CAH can vary widely, leading to different perceptions and attitudes toward individuals with the condition. Lack of awareness or misconceptions about CAH may contribute to stigma or discrimination.

Discussions around intersex conditions have evolved over time as societal understanding has progressed. There is a consensus that classical CAH is an intersex condition. However, for the nonclassical CAH, there is a debate on whether it can be considered an intersex condition. Anne Fausto-Sterling, an American sexologist, in a 2000 book &quot;Sexing the Body&quot; came up with an estimate that people with intersex conditions account for 1.7% of the general population. This estimate is cited by a number of prominent intersex advocacy organizations. Of these intersex individuals, according to Fausto-Sterling, 88% have nonclassical CAH. Leonard Sax, an American psychologist and a family physician, criticized these figures in a review published in 2002 in The Journal of Sex Research, stating that from the clinician&#x27;s perspective, nonclassical CAH is not an intersex condition. Including nonclassical CAH in intersex prevalence estimates has been cited by Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice, in a 2013 book &quot;Stat-Spotting: A Field Guide to Identifying Dubious Data&quot; as an example of misleading statistical practice.

Different cultural contexts may shape views on gender identity, sexuality, and medical interventions for intersex conditions. Individuals with visible differences or unique health needs associated with CAH may face social stigmatization due to a lack of awareness, prejudice, or preconceived notions about intersexuality.

Activists, such as Hida Viloria, who was born with a form of CAH, advocate for compassionate care for people born intersex.

== Research directions ==
Gene therapy is an experimental therapeutic approach that aims to correct the underlying genetic defect responsible for a particular condition. In the context of CAH, caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene, gene replacement therapy involves introducing a functional copy of this gene into the cells where this gene is expressed. The goal is to normalize the production of 21-hydroxylase, the enzyme encoded by CYP21A2. Providing a working copy of this gene may improve adrenal hormone synthesis and subsequently normalize cortisol and aldosterone production.

Currently, gene replacement therapy for CAH is still at an early stage of research and development. Various approaches are being explored, including using viral vectors carrying a healthy copy of the CYP21A2 gene to deliver it into target cells. Another approach is based on utilizing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate steroid-producing cells that can potentially replace or supplement dysfunctional adrenal tissue in individuals with CAH. However, it remains unclear how new approaches can be tested, as there are even no experimental models yet for this disease for gene therapy.

<text>Allen Kenneth Johnson (born March 1, 1971) is an American former hurdling athlete who won the gold medal in the 110 metre hurdles at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He is also a four-time world champion.

Born in Washington, D.C., an all-round athlete, Johnson attended University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and excelled at high jump, long jump and decathlon as well as hurdles. He was the 1992 NCAA Indoor Champion for 55 meter hurdles but did not win the outdoor championship.

== Career ==

Johnson was troubled by injury in 2000 but still made the final at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, just missing out on adding to his medal collection by finishing fourth.

2003 in the Stade de France, saw Johnson win his fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics 110 m hurdles title when he beat Terrence Trammell into second to overtake the three world championship gold medals that Greg Foster had won at the event.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics he tripped over a hurdle in the 2nd preliminary round and was unable to finish the race and reach the final. He was however ranked world&#x27;s number 1 throughout 2004&#x27;s season.

Johnson was trained by Curtis Frye, at the University of South Carolina where he served as a volunteer assistant coach. Formerly, the sprint and hurdles coach at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, Johnson is now the Assistant Head Coach at the North Carolina State University under Rollie Geiger.

His personal best is 12.92 seconds, only 0.01 seconds short of the then-world record held by Colin Jackson. Johnson has legally finished 11 races in less than 13 seconds, which was the most all time until Grant Holloway secured 12 on September 6, 2024. His 12.96 (+0.4) set while winning the 2006 IAAF World Cup at age 35, is the Masters M35 World Record. Johnson officially retired in July 2010, at the age of 39. Daughter, Tristine Johnson, competes as a 2014 senior at his alma mater University of North Carolina.

His use of these songs got him into some legal trouble, as he had not obtained permission to sample Santana&#x27;s songs, nor were any royalty fees paid to Santana before recording and releasing the track. Ace recorded one additional album, &quot;The Brother with Two Tongues&quot;, before virtually retiring from the music scene, but 2000 saw the release of the album &quot;From the Darkness into the Light&quot;.

<text>Jackie Kallen (born Jackie Kaplan, April 23, 1946) is one of boxing&#x27;s first and most successful female managers. Her life was the inspiration for the 2004 film &quot;Against the Ropes&quot;, starring Meg Ryan as Kallen, in which she had a brief speaking role as a reporter. She also worked as a consultant for Mark Burnett&#x27;s reality TV series &quot;The Contender&quot;.

Kallen was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the Non-Participant category as part of the class of 2024.

==Early life==
Kallen was raised in a middle-class Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan, United States.

==Career==
A show business journalist for a magazine in the 1970s, Kallen interviewed the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and countless others. In 1977 she was assigned to interview a boxing prospect from the Kronk gym in Detroit, Michigan, Thomas Hearns. Kallen became fascinated with sports and began working as a sports journalist specializing in boxing.

Kallen spent a decade as Hearns&#x27; publicist as Hearns went on to face Sugar Ray Leonard in two championship fights. In the process she became well known around Detroit&#x27;s boxing circles but met with sexism along the way.

Kallen made her managerial debut with heavyweight Bobby Hitz in 1988. She managed her first champion in 1991, James Toney knocking out Michael Nunn in eleven rounds to win the IBF world Middleweight title. Another Kallen fighter, Bronco McKart, won the WBO world Jr. Middleweight title in 1996.

Her business relationship with Toney was controversial but allowed her to gain celebrity among boxing&#x27;s hard-core fans. She was featured in &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;KO Magazine&quot;. Kallen referred to Toney many times as someone she loved like a son.

Kallen was diagnosed both with heart disease and cancer starting in the year 2000, but after multiple surgeries she recovered and is enjoying good health.

Kallen is the author of two books - &quot;Hit Me With Your Best Shot&quot; and &quot;Between the Ropes&quot;. She is also the subject of Peter Mann&#x27;s book &quot;Against the Odds: The Jackie Story.&quot; Kallen makes appearances nationwide as a motivational speaker and currently lives in the Detroit area and manages three professional boxers, including Mykquan Williams and Sam Rizzo.

In December 2021, it was announced that Kallen is producing &quot;The Legend of Jack and Diane&quot;, a feature film described as a female-led revenge thriller directed by Bruce Bellocchi and starring Tom Sizemore, Lydia Zelmac, David Tomlinson, Robert LaSardo, and Carlo Mendez. Rick Geller is executive producer of the film. Filming began in Los Angeles on January 17, 2022, in Los Angeles.

== Personal life ==
Jackie was married to Gary Kallen from 1966 to 1997.

<text>An apostolic administration in the Catholic Church is administrated by a prelate appointed by the pope to serve as the ordinary for a specific area. Either the area is not yet a diocese (a stable &#x27;pre-diocesan&#x27;, usually missionary apostolic administration), or is a diocese, archdiocese, eparchy or similar permanent ordinariate (such as a territorial prelature or a territorial abbacy) that either has no bishop or archbishop (an apostolic administrator &quot;sede vacante&quot;, as after an episcopal death, resignation or transfer to other (arch)diocese) or, in very rare cases, has an incapacitated (arch)bishop (apostolic administrator &quot;sede plena&quot;). The title also applies to an outgoing (arch)bishop while awaiting for the date of assuming his new position.

== Characteristics ==
Apostolic administrators of stable administrations are equivalent in canon law with diocesan bishops and archbishops, meaning they have essentially the same authority as a diocesan bishop and archbishop. This type of apostolic administrator is usually the bishop or archbishop of a titular see.

Administrators &quot;sede vacante&quot; or &quot;sede plena&quot; only serve in their role until a newly chosen diocesan bishop or archbishop takes possession of the (arch)diocese. They are restricted by canon law in what they can do to the (arch)diocese they temporarily administer. For example, such an administrator may not sell real estate owned by the diocese or archdiocese. This type of administrator is commonly an auxiliary bishop and a priest serving as the vicar general of the (arch)diocese, or the ordinary of a neighboring (arch)diocese.

Normally when a diocese or archdiocese falls vacant, either the previously appointed coadjutor bishop takes possession of the see, or (a successor is not yet installed or assumed office) a vicar capitular or (arch)diocesan administrator is chosen locally but the pope, being head of the Catholic Church, may decide to name an administrator himself instead of waiting for the college of consultors of a particular diocese or archdiocese to appoint a diocesan or archdiocesan administrator where it is then called an apostolic administrator. Sometimes a retiring, promoted or transferred (arch)bishop is designated to be apostolic administrator until his successor is installed; sometimes the metropolitan or a fellow suffragan is appointed.

== Apostolic administrations==
In March 2021, there were the following stable apostolic administrations, most administered by a (titular or external) bishop.

Most are of the Roman rite; most are in former or current communist countries.
* Apostolic Administration of Atyrau, in Kazakhstan, suffragan of the Metropolitan Archbishopric of Astana
* Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus, immediately subject to the Holy See, established in 1991 for two predominantly Orthodox former Soviet Republics: Georgia (the cathedral is in its capital Tbilisi) and Armenia
* Apostolic Administration of Estonia, one of the Baltic Countries; immediately subject to Rome, established in 1924, with its cathedral in the capital Tallinn. On September 26, 2024, after 100 years as an Apostolic Administration, the Vatican announced that it had raised the apostolic administration of Tallinn to the level of diocese.
* Apostolic Administration of Harbin in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, immediately subject to Rome, established in 1935, with a cathedral and a bishop without papal mandate since 2012, recognized from the Holy See in 2018
* , immediately subject to the Holy See, established in 1968 for Fuchien Province (Kinmen and Matsu Islands) of the Republic of China (Taiwan)
* Apostolic Administration of Kyrgyzstan, a mainly Islamic former Soviet Republic in Central Asia; immediately subject to Rome, founded in 1997 as a mission sui juris and promoted in 2006
* Apostolic Administration of Uzbekistan, predominantly Islamic former Soviet Republic in Central Asia, immediately subject to Rome, founded in 1997 as a mission &quot;sui juris&quot; and promoted in 2005.

Some apostolic administrations have jurisdiction not only over Latin Rite Catholics, but also over Catholics of other rites, not having their own jurisdictions there:
* Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania, with pro-cathedral see at Vlorë, established in 1939 for all Catholics in southern regions of Albania, both of Latin and Byzantine rites; since 2005, it is suffragan of the Metropolitan of Tirana–Durrës.

Also some apostolic administrations have jurisdiction only over Catholics of the Byzantine Rite, that not having their own jurisdictions there:
* Apostolic Administration of Kazakhstan and Central Asia for Faithful of Byzantine Rite, with a see in Karaganda, for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

=== Diocese of Pyongyang ===
The Diocese of Pyongyang, North Korea: its last official bishop, Francis Hong Yong-ho, was imprisoned by the communist regime of Kim Il Sung in 1949 and later disappeared. The Metropolitan Archbishop of Seoul (South Korea) acts as the apostolic administrator for Pyongyang, as religion is suppressed in North Korea.

== Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney==
In addition, the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney is a non-territorial jurisdiction, similar to a personal prelature, which is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province. It is a separate particular church for traditionalist Catholics within the Brazilian Diocese of Campos, a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Niterói.

The personal apostolic administration was formed by Pope John Paul II to administer to a group of traditionalist Catholic priests, using the Tridentine Mass, who reconciled with Rome on January 18, 2002. The group had been formed by Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer and had been associated with the Society of St. Pius X of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.

== Outgoing (arch)bishops ==
While awaiting for the date of assuming his new position or installation, the outgoing (arch)bishop can still serve as bishop or archbishop of a diocese or an archdiocese and at the same time act as the apostolic administrator of a/an (arch)diocese he currently leads from the announcement or appointment to assuming into his new position.

== Temporary administration of vacant sees ==
It is fairly typical that the pope can decide to name an administrator himself to a diocese or archdiocese which lacks an ordinary (bishop or archbishop) called as apostolic administrator instead of waiting for the college of consultors of a particular (arch)diocese to appoint a diocesan or archdiocesan administrator. Usually, the emeritus (arch)bishop will be appointed in such a case. If the appointed apostolic administrator is a diocesan bishop or archbishop of a diocese or archdiocese, then he governs two (arch)dioceses which are his own and the vacant one, with the latter being temporarily while a successor of a vacant (arch)diocese is not yet installed or assumed office. Recently (and in exception to the latter), the archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh had Philip Tartaglia under this procedure.

For example, Luis Antonio Tagle, Archbishop of Manila, was appointed as Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 8 December 2019 and ended his tenure as the archdiocese&#x27;s archbishop when he took office on 9 February 2020. Broderick Soncuaco Pabillo, then-Auxiliary Bishop of Manila, was then appointed as apostolic administrator until Cardinal Jose Advincula became Tagle&#x27;s successor as archbishop on 24 June 2021.

Ruperto Cruz Santos, fourth Bishop of Balanga in Bataan and Socrates Buenaventura Villegas&#x27; successor for 13 years, 3 months, and 21 days from 1 April 2010 to 22 July 2023 and assumed office on 8 July 2010 (4,860 days), ended his tenure as the diocese&#x27;s bishop when he became fifth Bishop of Antipolo having jurisdiction over Marikina in Metro Manila and the province of Rizal upon his installation on 22 July 2023 to succeed Francisco Mendoza de Leon who retired as bishop on the said date of July 2023. Florentino Galang Lavarias, Archbishop of San Fernando, Pampanga, was then appointed as the diocese&#x27;s apostolic administrator while awaiting for the installation of Santos&#x27; successor as Bishop of Balanga. Honesto Flores Ongtioco, second Bishop of Balanga from 18 June 1998 to 28 August 2003 who succeeded Celso Nogoy Guevarra and Bishop of Cubao in Quezon City since 28 August 2003, served as the apostolic administrator of Malolos covering the province of Bulacan and the city of Valenzuela from 11 May 2018 to 21 August 2019 due to the death of Jose Francisco Oliveros who served as the diocese&#x27;s fourth bishop for 14 years from 14 May 2004 to 11 May 2018.

Michael Yeung Ming-cheung, the Bishop of Hong Kong, died on 3 January 2019. Cardinal John Tong Hon, Bishop Emeritus, was appointed as apostolic administrator.

There is also the ability for the pope to appoint an apostolic administrator &quot;sede plena&quot;. Anthony Sablan Apuron, the Archbishop of Agaña, was under investigation for sexual abuse in June 2016; Pope Francis appointed Savio Hon Tai-fai as apostolic administrator &quot;sede plena&quot;, as temporary replacement. On 31 October 2016, Michael J. Byrnes, then Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit, was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Agaña with full administrative authority, and later succeeded as archbishop.

<doc id="802071" wikidata="Q942985" url="?curid=802071" title="Harki">
<text>Harki (adjective from the Algerian Arabic &quot;&quot;ḥarka&quot;, standard Arabic &quot;ḥaraka&quot;&quot; [حركة], &quot;war party&quot; or &quot;movement&quot;, i.e., a group of volunteer militia) is the generic term for native Muslim Algerians who served as auxiliaries alongside the French Army during the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. The word sometimes applies to all Algerian Muslims (thus including civilians) who supported French Algeria during the war. The motives for enlisting were mixed. They were regarded as traitors in independent Algeria and thousands of them were reportedly killed after the war in reprisals, despite the Évian Accords ceasefire and amnesty stipulations. President Charles de Gaulle controversially made the decision to not give the Harkis sanctuary in France, viewing them as &quot;soldiers of fortune&quot; who should be discharged as soon as possible.

In France the term can apply to &quot;Franco-musulmans rapatriés&quot; (repatriated French Muslims) living in the country since 1962 - and to their metropolitan-born descendants. In this sense, the term &quot;Harki&quot; refers to a social group - a fraction of the French Muslims from Algeria - as distinct from other French of Algerian origin, or from Algerians living in France.

The French government wanted to avoid their massive resettlement in France. Early arrivals were interned in remote detainee camps and were victimized by endemic racism. By 2012, however, 800,000 Harkis, Pieds-Noirs and their descendants over the age of 18 lived in France. French President Jacques Chirac established 25 September 2001 as the Day of National Recognition for the Harkis. On 14 April 2012, President Nicolas Sarkozy recognized France&#x27;s &quot;historical responsibility&quot; in abandoning Harki French Muslim veterans at the time of the war.

== Before the Algerian conflict ==
Muslim Algerians had served in large numbers as regular soldiers with the French Army of Africa from 1830 to 1962. Enlisting as &quot;spahis&quot; (cavalry) and &quot;tirailleurs&quot; (lit. skirmisher, i.e. infantry), they played an important part during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and especially during World War I (1914–1918), when 100,000 died in fighting against the Imperial German Army.

During World War II, after the rearmament of the French Army accomplished by the US forces in North Africa in 1942–1943, North African troops serving with the French Army numbered about 233,000 (more than 50% of the Free French Army effectives). They made a major contribution during the liberation of Southern France (1944) and in the campaigns in Italy (French Expeditionary Corps) and Germany of 1944–45.

&quot;Tirailleurs&quot; from Algeria, Morocco and West Africa fought in Indochina as part of the French Expeditionary Force until the Fall of Dien Bien Phu (1954).

== Algerian War ==
With the outbreak of the Algerian War in 1954, the loyalty of the Muslim Algerian soldiers to France inevitably came under heavy strain. Some of the regular units were transferred from Algeria to France or Germany following increased incidents of desertion or small-scale mutiny.

As a partial replacement, the French administration recruited the Harkis as irregular militia based in their home villages or towns throughout Algeria. Initially raised as self-defence units, the Harkis, from 1956 on, increasingly served alongside the French Army in the field. They were lightly armed (often only with shotguns and antique rifles), but their knowledge of local terrain and conditions made them valuable auxiliaries to French regular units.

According to General R. Hure, by 1960 approximately 150,000 Muslim Algerians served in the French Army or as auxiliaries. In addition to volunteers and conscripts serving in regular units, this total took into account 95,000 Harkis (including 20,000 in separate &quot;mokhazni&quot; district police forces and 15,000 in &quot;commando de chasse&quot; tracking units).

French authorities claimed that more Algerian Muslims served with the French regular army than with the Algerian nationalist Front de Libération Nationale (FLN). According to US Army data, possibly compiled at a different date, the Harkis numbered about 180,000, more than the total FLN effectives. A 1995 study by General Faivre indicates that by 1961 about 210,000 Muslim Algerians served in the French Army or as auxiliaries, and a maximum of 50,000 in the FLN.
A report to the United Nations dated 13 March 1962 gave an estimated total of 263,000 &quot;pro-French Muslims&quot; broken down to 20,000 regular soldiers, 40,000 conscripts, 78,000 Harkis and Moghaznis, 15,000 mobile group commandos and 60,000 civilian self-defense group members. The remaining 50,000 included Muslim government officials and veterans of the French Army.

The French civil administration used the Harkis as either home defence militia or as guerrilla-style field units, though mostly in conventional formations. They generally served either in all-Algerian units commanded by French officers seconded from the regular army or in mixed units. Others were employed in platoon- or below-sized units attached to French battalions. A third use involved Harkis in intelligence-gathering roles, with some reported minor false-flag operations in support of intelligence collection.

The Harkis had mixed motives for working with the French. Unemployment was widespread amongst the Muslim population, especially in rural districts with a low level of literacy. Therefore, serving in irregular home defence or other auxiliary units alongside the French army, was seen as providing a stable livelihood. The FLN had attacked members of rival nationalist groups as well as pro-French Muslim collaborators; and some Algerians enrolled in the Harkis to avenge the deaths of relatives who had been political opponents of the FLN. Others defected from the FLN rebel forces, persuaded by one means or another to change sides. Many Harkis came from families or other groups who had traditionally given service to France. A principal motive for fighting on the side of the French was to provide for family and protect property, rather than strictly a patriotic devotion to France.

From the viewpoint of Algerian nationalists, all Harkis were traitors; but at independence, the signatories of the March 1962 cease-fire (&quot;Accords d&#x27;Evian&quot; signed by France and the Algerian FLN), guaranteed that no one, Harkis or Pieds-Noirs (Algerian-born Europeans with French nationality), would suffer reprisals after independence for any action during the war.

== Post-war abandonment and reprisals ==
In 1962 the French government of Charles de Gaulle originally ordered officials and army officers to block the Harkis from following the Pieds-Noirs and seeking refuge in metropolitan France. William B. Cohen wrote:
Some officers of the French army disobeyed and tried to assist the Harkis under their command - as well as their families - to escape from Algeria. About 90,000 Harkis (including family members) found refuge in France.

On the other hand, the far-right Organisation armée secrète terrorist group initiated a campaign of bombings in Algeria following the Évian Accords to block Pieds-Noirs population from leaving the country.

As feared, took place against those Harkis who remained in Algeria. It is estimated that the National Liberation Front (FLN) or lynch mobs in Algeria killed at least 30,000 and possibly as many as 150,000 Harkis and their dependents, sometimes in circumstances of extreme cruelty.
In &quot;A Savage War Of Peace,&quot; Alistair Horne wrote:


After March 1962 the Algerian Muslim troops still serving as volunteer regulars within the French Army, were offered the option of continuing to serve under contract in France or else. Those who opted to be discharged and remain in independent Algeria were only occasionally subject to reprisals. Some leaders of the new Algerian Republic were veterans of the French Army, which prior to independence had provided one of the few avenues for advancement open to the Muslim majority in colonial society. By 1961 there were about 400 Algerian Muslim officers in the French Army, although only one had achieved promotion to the rank of general. Originally the only official provision made for transferring serving Harkis to France had been for those who were willing to enlist in the French Army. Most Harkis were ineligible for this option because it applied only to single men within limited age categories.

The French government, concerned mainly with disengagement from Algeria and the repatriation of the Pieds-Noirs, disregarded or downplayed news of the massacres of Harkis. Charles de Gaulle appears to have been indifferent to the plight of the Muslim loyalists according to Horne, who reported that the president remarked to one of their spokesmen &quot;Eh bien ! vous souffrirez&quot; (&quot;Well then — you will suffer&quot;). On 19 March 1962 the responsible Minister of State Louis Joxe ordered attempts by French officers to transfer Harkis and their families to France to cease, followed by a statement that &quot;the Auxiliary troops landing in the Metropolis in deviation from the general plan will be sent back to Algeria&quot;.

== Harki refugees in France ==

The French government did not plan for the Harkis after independence, and for some years it did not recognize any right for them to stay in France as residents and citizens. The Harkis were kept in &quot;temporary&quot; internment camps surrounded by barbed wire, such as the Camp de Rivesaltes (Joffre Camp) in Rivesaltes outside of Perpignan and in &quot;chantiers de forestage&quot; — communities of 30 Harki families on the outskirts of forests which the men maintained. The French government has since enacted various measures to help the Harki community (notably the 1994 Romani law and the 2005 Mekachera law); although in the views of community leaders these laws are often too little, too late.

The government of Jacques Chirac subsequently acknowledged these former allies, holding public ceremonies to commemorate their sacrifices, such as the 25 September 2001 Day of National Recognition for the Harkis.
While active Harki associations in France continue working to obtain further recognition and aid in integrating into the society; they are still a largely un-assimilated refugee minority. For its part, the Algerian government does not recognize the Harkis as French citizens. It does not permit them to enter Algeria to visit their birth-places or family members left behind in that country.

Harkis are sometimes described in France as &quot;Français par le sang versé&quot; (&quot;French by spilled blood&quot;).

Since Algerian independence, &quot;Harki&quot; has been used as a derogatory expression within Algeria. Amongst some of the Franco-Algerian community, Harkis have been likened to collaborators in France during the German occupation in World War II. Algerian historian Mohammed Harbi, a former FLN member, believes that comparison between Harkis and traitors or &quot;collaborators&quot; is not pertinent.

In July 2020, president Emmanuel Macron commissioned the French historian of Algerian-Jewish heritage Benjamin Stora to write a report and make his recommendations concerning the &quot;memories of colonization and the Algerian War&quot;. This report was delivered to the French government in January 2021. In September 2021, Macron asked for &quot;forgiveness on behalf of his country for abandoning Algerians who fought alongside France in their country&#x27;s war of independence&quot; and that France had &quot;failed in its duty towards the Harkis, their wives, [and] their children&quot;.

== Other references ==
During the Algerian Civil War of 1991–2002, the Islamic fundamentalist insurgents used &quot;harkis&quot; as an abusive term for government police and soldiers.

In 2006, French politician Georges Frêche generated controversy after telling a group of Harkis in Montpellier that they were &quot;subhumans&quot;. He later claimed he had been referring to a specific individual in the crowd, but was fined 15,000 Euros for the statement. Frêche was later expelled from the Socialist Party for his remarks.

Harkis were a distinct group from the &quot;Évolués&quot;, a sub-group of Algerians who became closely identified with the French, (or similar groups in other colonial territories), an Algerian or North African who assimilated closely to French culture through education, government service, and language. 

By contrast, the Harkis were mostly culturally Algerian, speaking limited French, and largely indistinguishable from the majority of ordinary Algerians except for their service in French auxiliary military units. While many of the &quot;Évolués&quot; migrated to France during the Algerian Revolution, some remained in independent Algeria after 1962.

<doc id="802072" wikidata="Q3686058" url="?curid=802072" title="Concertato">
<text>Concertato is a term in early Baroque music referring to either a &quot;genre&quot; or a &quot;style&quot; of music in which groups of instruments or voices share a melody, usually in alternation, and almost always over a basso continuo. The term derives from Italian &quot;concerto&quot; which means &quot;playing together&quot;—hence &quot;concertato&quot; means &quot;in the style of a concerto.&quot; In contemporary usage, the term is almost always used as an adjective, for example &quot;three pieces from the set are in &quot;concertato&quot; style.&quot;

A somewhat oversimplified, but useful distinction between concertato and concerto can be made: the &quot;concertato&quot; style involves contrast between opposing groups of voices and groups of instruments: the &quot;concerto&quot; style, especially as it developed into the &quot;concerto grosso&quot; later in the Baroque, involves contrast between large and small groups of similar composition (later called &quot;ripieno&quot; and &quot;concertino&quot;).

The style developed in Venice in the late 16th century, mainly through the work of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, who were working in the unique acoustical space of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica. Different choirs or instrumental groupings occupied positions across the basilica from each other: because of the sound delay from one side to the other in the large and acoustically &quot;live&quot; space, a perfect unison was difficult, and composers found that a fantastically effective music could be composed with the choirs singing across to each other, in stereo as it were; all accompanied by organ or other groups of instruments placed in such a way that they could hear each group equally well. Music written there was quickly performed elsewhere, and compositions in the new &quot;concertato&quot; style quickly became popular elsewhere in Europe (first in northern Italy, then in Germany and the rest of Italy, and then gradually in other parts of the continent). Another term sometimes used for this antiphonal use of the choirs in St. Mark&#x27;s was &quot;cori spezzati&quot;. See also Venetian polychoral style and Venetian School.

In the early 17th century, almost all music with voices and basso continuo was called a concerto, though this use of the term is considerably different from the more modern meaning (a solo instrument or instruments accompanied by an orchestra). Often, sacred music in the concertato style in the early 17th century was descended from the motet: the texts that a hundred years earlier would have been set for a cappella voices singing in smooth polyphony, would now be set for voices and instruments in a concertato style. These pieces, no longer always called motets, were given a variety of names including &quot;concerto&quot;, Psalm (if a psalm setting), &quot;sinfonia&quot;, or &quot;symphoniae&quot; (for example in Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s three books of Symphoniae sacrae).

The concertato style made possible the composition of extremely dramatic music, one of the characteristic innovations of the early Baroque.

<doc id="802074" wikidata="Q2496194" url="?curid=802074" title="1984 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active since 1971, though the season was below average in hurricanes and major hurricanes. It officially began on June 1, 1984, and lasted until November 30, 1984. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The 1984 season was an active one in terms of named storms, but most of them were weak and stayed at sea. Most of the cyclones tracked through the northwest subtropical Atlantic west of the 50th meridian to near the Eastern coast of the United States between mid-August and early October. The most damaging storm was Hurricane Klaus, which caused $152 million (1984 dollars) in damage in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Diana was the first hurricane to strike a nuclear power plant without incident; it was also the first major hurricane to strike the U.S. East Coast in nearly 20 years. Also of note was Hurricane Lili, which lasted well after the official end of the season. It was downgraded from a named storm on December 24. Damage overall from the tropical cyclones in 1984 totaled $228.7 million (1984 USD). Unusually, no hurricanes developed from tropical waves in 1984, which usually are the source of the strongest storms in an Atlantic hurricane season.

==Seasonal forecasts==

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the period from 1981 to 2010, has approximately 12 named storms, with 6 of those reaching hurricane status. About 3 hurricanes strengthen into major hurricanes, which are tropical cyclones that reach at least Category 3 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale.

On July 23, 1983, forecasters at CSU predicted an above-average season in 1984 with a total of 11 tropical storms developing, 8 of which would reach hurricane status, under the assumption that sea-level pressures over the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico would be normal. Early in 1984, the Weather Research Center (WRC) forecast on the other hand called for a below-average season with seven named storms, with four of those strengthening into a hurricane. on May 24, 1984, forecasters at CSU revised their prediction downwards to a total of 10 tropical storms, 7 of which would reach hurricane status, as the easterly Quasi-biennial oscillation cycle had lasted longer than expected and the previously expected La Niña event in 1984 had yet to form and was now not expected until the autumn or winter, On the other hand, sea-level pressures over the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico were more favorable than expected. These numbers were unchanged in CSU&#x27;s next season outlook, issued on July 30. None of these predictions included a forecast for the number of major hurricanes. Ultimately, the predictions issued by CSU proved to be too high for hurricanes and too low for tropical storms, with 13 subtropical or tropical storms forming in 1984 and 5 of those reaching hurricane status. CSU attributed the overforecast of hurricanes to the easterly QBO cycle not changing during the hurricane season as was expected and the sea-level pressures from August to October being less favorable than expected, and the underforecast of tropical storms to the unusual amount of formation in the subtropics from mid-latitude residual frontal activity.
==Seasonal summary==
Six storms during the season had subtropical characteristics at some point in their track, those being Subtropical Storm One, Tropical Storm Cesar, Hurricane Hortense, Hurricane Josephine, Hurricane Klaus, and Hurricane Lili.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 84, which is classified as &quot;near normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

===Tropical Depression One===

By June 11, an upper-level low caused thunderstorm development off the Florida coast, which caused the formation of a tropical depression. Moving westward, the depression moved into St. Augustine, causing a total of of rainfall at Jacksonville Beach, Florida, as its main thunderstorm activity was concentrated north of the center. It dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June 14 while moving through the Florida panhandle. The small remnant low continued moving westward inland of the Gulf coast, causing occasional redevelopment of thunderstorm activity as the system moved into Louisiana, before both the thunderstorm activity and low-pressure area dissipated by June 17.
===Tropical Depression Two===

An upper-level low-pressure area traversing the southern Gulf of Mexico spawned convective activity over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on June 16. This convective area waxed and waned somewhat in intensity, until becoming a larger disturbance on June 18. A surface low soon formed, and around 12:00 UTC that day, the system developed into a tropical depression over the Bay of Campeche. With vertical wind shear preventing significant further intensification, the depression made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). The depression quickly dissipated over the mountainous terrain of eastern Mexico. The cyclone and its precursor dropped heavy rainfall in some areas, including a peak total of of precipitation in San Lucas Ojitlán, Oaxaca.
===Tropical Depression Three===

A tropical depression formed about east of the Windward Islands on July 24. Moving west-northwestward, the depression passed between Martinique and Saint Lucia early on the following day. On the latter, the storm dropped up to of precipitation. The Castries River overflowed its banks, washing away three homes in the eastern section of Castries. Two commercial fisherman were reported missing. Barbados recorded up to of rainfall in association with the system. The depression entered the Caribbean Sea and failed to intensify further, dissipating about halfway between the Dominican Republic and Venezuela late on July 26. 
===Subtropical Storm One===

A weak frontal trough generated a low-pressure system that organized into a subtropical depression north of Bermuda on August 18. The depression headed northeast and strengthened to a subtropical storm. It is believed to have merged with a front on August 21. The history of Subtropical Storm One is not entirely certain, as satellite images were largely unavailable due to a failure of the VISSR unit on GOES EAST (then GOES-5), and this system remained at the fringe of the GOES WEST and Meteosat throughout its existence. Wind gusts up to were reported on the southwest coast of Newfoundland. In addition, a weather office on the island reported rainfall at .
===Tropical Storm Arthur===

A well-defined tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 23. Moving westward and later northwestward, the system remained to the south of a persistent shearing pattern that inhibited the development of several tropical waves. A reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that a tropical depression formed late on August 28 roughly east of Trinidad. On the next day, another reconnaissance flight recorded tropical storm conditions, and thus, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Arthur. The cyclone attained its peak intensity several hours later with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Arthur was downgraded to a depression on September 1 after being negatively impacted by vertical wind shear, and dissipated on September 5 about halfway between the Bahamas and Bermuda. Despite its close proximity to the Lesser Antilles, Arthur caused no significant impact on land as it was a tropical depression at the time.
===Tropical Storm Bertha===

On August 26, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed into a tropical depression about west-southwest of the southwesternmost islands of Cape Verde and in close proximity to the east of Arthur. A reconnaissance flight into the depression on August 31 indicated that it strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha. Later that day, Bertha peaked as a minimal tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The system moved northwestward due to a weakening high pressure ridge to the north. Based on observations from reconnaissance flights on September 1, Bertha was downgraded to a tropical depression. On September 2, Bertha turned north-northeastward into response to an approaching cold front. The cold front then eroded the high pressure ridge, causing the cyclone to accelerate northeastward. Bertha later merged with the cold front on September 4.
===Tropical Storm Cesar===

A second storm formed on August 31 as a non-tropical low strengthened into Tropical Storm Cesar off the East Coast of the United States. Cesar traveled east-northeast and strengthened gradually until it became extratropical and merged with another system off the coast of Newfoundland on September 2.
===Tropical Depression Seven===

A tropical wave moved across Central America into the far eastern north Pacific Ocean by August 28. The system moved westward with no signs of development until September 1, when an upper-level low to its north across the Gulf of Mexico caused an area of thunderstorms to form just south of the Mexican coastline. An upper trough developed across the southern Plains of the United States, which slowly lured the northern portion of this increasingly large disturbance northward through the Mexican Isthmus. The southern portion moved westward, developing into Hurricane Marie. For a short while, Marie acted as a source of vertical wind shear from the west for this system, halting further development.

By September 6, the disturbance had emerged into the southwest Gulf of Mexico and consolidated into a smaller system which had enough organization to be classified as a tropical depression, the seventh of the season. The depression moved north-northwest into northeast Mexico on the afternoon of September 7, dissipating completely on September 8.
===Hurricane Diana===
On September 8, an extratropical cyclone organized into Tropical Storm Diana north of the Bahamas. Diana proved difficult for meteorologists to forecast, initially moving westward towards Cape Canaveral, but then turned to the north and paralleled the coastline. On September 11, the storm reached hurricane strength, and continued to intensify to a Category 4 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Diana moved north-northeast, and performed a small anti-cyclonic loop before striking near Cape Fear, North Carolina, as a minimal Category 2 hurricane on September 13. A weakened Diana curved back out to sea and headed northeast until it became extratropical near Newfoundland on September 16.

Severe beach erosion impacted Horry County, South Carolina, damaging 90 residences, 40 multi-family dwellings, 8 mobile homes, and a few businesses. In North Carolina, precipitation peaked at near Southport. Many areas in southeastern North Carolina reported freshwater flooding, with parts of Duplin, Pender, and Sampson counties experiencing 100-year flood events. High winds damaged some buildings and homes, especially in coastal areas of Brunswick and New Hanover counties. Throughout the state, Diana destroyed 68 homes and substantially damaged 325 others. Damage estimates were set at $65.5 million, with about $26.5 million of that figure dealt to agriculture. Three deaths, all due to indirect causes, occurred in relation to the storm. Diana became the first hurricane to strike a nuclear power plant — the Brunswick Nuclear Generating Station, which recorded sustained hurricane-force winds but no damage to the facility.
===Tropical Storm Edouard===

The origins of Tropical Storm Edouard are unclear, but an area of persistent organized storms formed in the Bay of Campeche, which strengthened into a tropical storm on September 14. Edouard rapidly intensified, with wind speeds reaching in 18 hours as a faint eye feature became visible. Following its strengthening, Edouard dissipated even more quickly, degenerating into an area of thunderstorms the next day. The remnants of Edouard moved over land near the port of Veracruz.
===Tropical Storm Fran===
On September 14, a well-defined tropical wave exited the coast of Africa. The next day, it had rapidly organized into a tropical depression. On the afternoon of September 16 the depression attained tropical storm strength, and it was given the name Fran. It turned to the northwest, and passed very near the Cape Verde. 31 people were killed in the country. Fran continued between the northwest and west-northwest on September 17–18 as it continued to organize. During this period satellite imagery indicated that Fran peaked with winds of and a minimum surface pressure of . As Fran passed the Cape Verde islands weather stations reported winds, which is tropical depression force. During the period of September 19–20 Fran turned towards westward and began to encounter strong upper-level wind shear, which caused Fran to dissipate on September 20.
===Tropical Storm Gustav===

Gustav spent most of its life as a well-organized tropical depression, which formed on September 16 in the open Atlantic south of Bermuda. The depression moved north, and its motion stalled over Bermuda on September 17. A day later, the depression had strengthened to a tropical storm and was named Gustav. Tropical Storm Gustav headed northeast until it was absorbed by a front on September 19.
===Hurricane Hortense===

A large frontal system spawned a subtropical depression early on September 23, about 385 miles (620 km) east of Bermuda. Ship and satellite data confirmed its development, and indicated the system intensified into a subtropical storm later on September 23. Initially the cyclone moved toward the south-southwest, although on September 24 it turned to the west. That day, the hurricane hunters reported that the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone; as such, it was named Tropical Storm Hortense. The newly-tropical storm quickly intensified while turning to the northwest, and late on September 25 Hortense attained hurricane status, about 300 miles (475 km) southeast of Bermuda.

Twelve hours after reaching hurricane status, Hortense began a sharp weakening trend while passing east of Bermuda. By September 27 it was a minimal tropical storm, and subsequently it executed a clockwise loop to the southwest. The intensity of Hortense fluctuated slightly over the subsequent few days, although it never regained its former intensity. On September 30, after turning to the west and later to the north, the storm passed just west of Bermuda. As the storm was so weak, the island only reported winds of . Hortense accelerated to the northeast, moving rapidly across the north Atlantic before being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm late on October 2, northwest of the Azores.
===Tropical Storm Isidore===
A tropical depression formed on September 25 off the southeastern Bahamas. The depression headed west, and was upgraded to a tropical storm in the central Bahamas on September 26. It struck the US coast near Jupiter, Florida. Retaining tropical storm strength, Isidore curved to the northeast, emerging over water near Jacksonville, Florida. Isidore continued northeast until it was absorbed by a front on October 1. Total damages were estimated at over $750,000 (1984 US dollars). One death from electrocution was reported.
===Hurricane Josephine===
Josephine became a named storm on October 8 while northwest of Puerto Rico. It briefly moved west then turned almost due north. While it stayed well away from the U.S. coast, Josephine was a large storm and sustained tropical storm winds were measured at the Diamond Shoals of Cape Hatteras. When it passed 36°N latitude (roughly level with Norfolk, Virginia), Josephine curved to the southeast, then back to the northeast. It continued on this path until it made a cyclonic loop beginning on October 17 while becoming extratropical. The storm lost its identity on October 21. The hurricane caused wave damage to coastal areas, but primarily posed a threat to the shipping lanes of the North Atlantic.

Offshore, a sailboat with six crewmen on it became disabled due to high waves, estimated to have exceeded , produced by the hurricane. All of the people on the ship were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal by a nearby tanker vessel. In Massachusetts, one man drowned after falling off his boat on North River amidst large swells produced by the storm. In Long Island, New York and parts of New Jersey, tides between above normal resulted in minor coastal flooding.
===October Tropical Depression===

This system was recognized as the seventeenth tropical depression of the season by the National Hurricane Center after the season ended. A retrograding upper-level low spurred the development of a low east of the Bahamas on October 25. The system tracked westward with limited shower and thunderstorm activity, crossing Florida on October 26 before moving into the Gulf of Mexico. Once the system moved into the north-central Gulf, deep convection began to develop near its center, expanding in intensity and coverage near and after landfall in extreme southeast Mississippi. The small system accelerated rapidly to the north and northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, moving across the Tennessee Valley and central Appalachians before linking up with the front and becoming a weak extratropical cyclone. The non-tropical cyclone then moved through coastal New England.
===Hurricane Klaus===
Forming from a broad area of low pressure on November 5, Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path. After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico, it passed to the north of the Leeward Islands, resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas. Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding and light damage. Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the Leeward Islands, including wrecking at least three ships. The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage, as well. Damage from the storm totaled to $152 million (1984 USD), and the hurricane killed two on Dominica.
===November Tropical Depression===
A low-pressure system formed east of Florida on November 22 and rode up the East Coast of the United States producing heavy rain before curving back out to sea and dissipating on November 26. The storm left one fatality and $7.4 million (1984 USD) in damage. There has been evidence that the November storm may have become a subtropical cyclone east of Bermuda. The remnants of the cyclone contributed to formation of a potent nor&#x27;easter.
===Hurricane Lili===
In the second week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper-level disturbance moved over the area on December 9, and produced widespread convection along the frontal wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on a developing circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified it as a subtropical cyclone on December 12 while located northeast of Bermuda. A day later, a ridge forced the storm to the southeast and later to the south for a few days. A break in the ridge allowed the storm to turn back to the northeast on December 16, followed by a turn northwestward a day later. Another ridge halted the storm&#x27;s movement, turning it back to the southwest on December 18, and later to the south. During this time, the subtropical storm intensified, with satellite-estimated hurricane-force winds by December 19. On the next day, a nearby ship recorded winds of 72 mph (117 km/h), along with a minimum pressure of . Based on the observations, as well as the appearance of a well-defined eye, the NHC reclassified the storm as Hurricane Lili on December 20, estimating peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a pressure of . At the time, Lili was located about east of Bermuda. Lili was only one of six Atlantic hurricanes on record during the month of December.

After becoming a tropical cyclone, Lili accelerated to the southwest, completing a large cyclonic loop by December 22, after crossing over the same location one week prior. That day, a hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22. However, Lili weakened due to increased wind shear, degrading to a tropical storm on December 23 while northeast of Antigua. The storm rapidly lost organization as it approached the Leeward Islands, dissipating near the northern coast of the Dominican Republic on December 24. The storm brought light rainfall to the region.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1984. Most names were used for the first time, except for &quot;Bertha&quot; and &quot;Fran&quot;, which were previously used under the old naming convention. No names were retired following the season, so the list was used again in the 1990 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1984 USD.

<text>The Tension and the Spark is the second studio album by Darren Hayes, released in 2004. The album was a change for Hayes, who took a more electronic and darker style for this record and also delved deeper into more personal matter. The title of the album is derived from lyrics featured in the second track, &quot;I Like the Way&quot;.

==Singles==
* &quot;Pop!ular&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single in July 2004 and became a hit, reaching #1 on the US Dance Chart, his first number one. NME praised the song, saying it was &quot;A twistered masterclass in career reintervention...This guy is a genius.&quot;
* &quot;Darkness&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in November 2004, but it did not chart. The physical single has subsequently become a rarity, with copies selling for £100 plus on second-hand websites and collector&#x27;s auctions.
* &quot;Unlovable&quot; was a promotional single for the album. While it was not released as a single of its own, the music video for the song was made.

<doc id="802081" wikidata="Q4596482" url="?curid=802081" title="1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment">
<text>The 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment was a Union infantry regiment active during the American Civil War. The 1st Minnesota participated in the battles of First Bull Run, Antietam and the Battle of Gettysburg. One of the regiment&#x27;s most famous actions was on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg when Major General Winfield Scott Hancock ordered the 1st Minnesota to charge into a brigade of 1,200 Confederate soldiers. This action blunted the Confederate attack and helped preserve the Union&#x27;s precarious position on Cemetery Ridge.

==History==

===Organization and early service===
On April 14, 1861, Minnesota Governor Alexander Ramsey was visiting Washington, D.C. when he first heard news of the attack on Fort Sumter causing him, along with Senator Wilkinson, to rush to the office of the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, to offer 1,000 Minnesotan Soldiers to the Union Army. Two days later, the Adjutant General of Minnesota, William H. Acker, issued an order for Minnesota&#x27;s Commissary General, H. Z. Mitchell, to enlist men for Minnesota&#x27;s 1st Regiment. Word spread and communities in Minnesota quickly raised companies of volunteers identified by locality. The companies traveled to the newly reactivated Fort Snelling to be enlisted into the regiment on April 29. These companies were the first troops offered by any state to meet Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 men to assist the Federal Government to deal with the secession. On May 10, they were re-enlisted for 3 more years of service. From Fort Snelling, they boarded river boats heading south to a rail line, whereafter they headed east.

Josias Ridgate King of the St. Paul Pioneer Guard is credited as being the first northern volunteer to stand to for Lincoln&#x27;s call for men to fight the Confederacy.
===First Bull Run===

On July 21, 1861, near Manassas, Virginia, the regiment fought in the first major battle of the American Civil War, the First Battle of Bull Run. While straddling Rickett&#x27;s Battery in support, the regiment saw heavy fighting on Henry House Hill in close proximity to the enemy. The 1st Minnesota was one of the last regiments to leave the battlefield and suffered one of the highest number of casualties of any northern regiment: 49 killed, 107 wounded and 34 missing.

During the 1st Minnesota Infantry&#x27;s initiation to combat, it was noted for honourable conduct by Colonel Franklin.

The First Minnesota Regiment moved from its position on the left of the field to the support of Ricketts&#x27; battery, and gallantly engaged the enemy at that point. It was so near the enemy&#x27;s lines that friends and foes were for a time confounded. The regiment behaved exceedingly well, and finally retired from the field in good order. The other two regiments of the brigade retired in confusion, and no efforts of myself or staff were successful in rallying them. I respectfully refer you to Colonel Gorman&#x27;s report for the account of his regiment&#x27;s behavior and of the good conduct of his officers and men.

===Antietam===
During General John Sedgwick&#x27;s ill-fated assault on the West Woods, the regiment suffered significant casualties (1 officer killed, 3 officers wounded, 15 enlisted killed, 79 enlisted wounded, 24 enlisted missing, for a total of 122 [28%] of 435 engaged) as Union forces were routed on that part of the field. The brigade commander noted, &quot;The First Minnesota Regiment fired with so much coolness and accuracy that they brought down [three times one] of the enemy&#x27;s flags, and finally cut the flag-staff in two.&quot;

===Gettysburg===

====July 2====
The regiment&#x27;s most famous action occurred during the second day&#x27;s fighting at Gettysburg, when Major General Winfield Scott Hancock ordered the 1st Minnesota, composed of roughly 250 men, to charge into a brigade of roughly 1,200 men belonging to James Longstreet&#x27;s corps and Richard H. Anderson&#x27;s Division. Although the regiment was outnumbered by a ratio of at least 5 to 1, charging was Hancock&#x27;s only opportunity to buy time for Union reinforcements to arrive. One survivor stated afterward that he expected the advance to result in &quot;death or wounds to us all&quot;. The regiment immediately obeyed the order and Hancock was reportedly amazed at the unit discipline, valor, and the tremendous casualties taken in carrying out his order. This action blunted the Confederate attack and helped preserve the Union&#x27;s precarious position on Cemetery Ridge at the end of the second day of the battle.

Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, commander of II Corps, could see two brigades of Southerners commanded by Brigadier General Cadmus M. Wilcox breaching the line in front of one of his batteries. Hancock quickly rode up to the troops guarding the battery and asked Colonel William Colvill what unit the troops belonged to. Colvill responded &quot;the 1st Minnesota&quot;, to which Hancock responded &quot;Attack that line!&quot; With their bayonets leveled, the Minnesotans broke the first lines. The intensity of their charge disrupted the Southern forces&#x27; advances. Just before the 1st Minnesota became nearly encircled by enemy troops, Union reinforcements arrived in time to allow some of the men to make a fighting withdrawal. Their charge bought the Union the time it needed for reinforcements to be brought up. During the charge, 215 of the 262 who made the charge became casualties within five minutes (47 killed, 121 wounded, 90 missing). That included the unit commander, Col. William Colvill, and all but three of his captains.

The 1st Minnesota&#x27;s flag lost five flag bearers, each man dropping his weapon to carry it on. The 47 survivors rallied back to General Hancock under the command of their senior surviving officer, Captain Nathan S. Messick. The 82% casualty rate stands as the second largest loss by any surviving U.S military unit in a single day&#x27;s engagement. The unit&#x27;s colors are displayed in the rotunda of the Minnesota Capitol for public appreciation.

In his official report, Confederate Brigadier General Cadmus M. Wilcox perceived the inequality of the fight differently (bold emphasis likely refers to the First Minnesota):&quot;This stronghold of the enemy [i.e., Cemetery Ridge], together with his batteries, were almost won, when still another line of infantry descended the slope in our front at a double-quick, to the support of their fleeing comrades and for the defense of the batteries. Seeing this contest so unequal, I dispatched my adjutant-general to the division commander, to ask that support be sent to my men, but no support came. Three several times did this last of the enemy&#x27;s lines attempt to drive my men back, and were as often repulsed. This struggle at the foot of the hill on which were the enemy&#x27;s batteries, though so unequal, was continued for some thirty minutes. With a second supporting line, the heights could have been carried. Without support on either my right or left, my men were withdrawn, to prevent their entire destruction or capture. The enemy did not pursue, but my men retired under a heavy artillery fire, and returned to their original position in line, and bivouacked for the night, pickets being left on the pike.&quot;

====July 3====
Carrying on from the heavy losses of the previous day, the remaining men of the 1st Minn. were reinforced by detached Companies F and L. The reunited regiment was moved a bit north of the previous day&#x27;s fight to one of the few places where Union lines were breached during Pickett&#x27;s Charge. They again had to charge into advancing Confederate troops with more losses. Capt. Messick was killed and Capt. W. B. Farrell mortally wounded, and Capt. Henry C. Coates had to take command. During this charge, Private Marshall Sherman of Company C captured the colors of the 28th Virginia Infantry and received the Medal of Honor for this exploit. The Confederate flag was taken back to Minnesota as a war trophy, where it remains.

After being knocked out by a bullet to the head and later shot in the hand, Corporal Henry D. O&#x27;Brien repeatedly picked up the fallen colors of the 1st Minnesota and carried a wounded comrade back to the Union lines. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.

===Later service===

The 1st Minnesota continued to serve in the Army of the Potomac. In 1863 it participated in the Bristoe and Mine Run Campaigns. The 1st Minnesota mustered at Fort Snelling on April 29, 1864. Many soldiers continued service as the 1st Minnesota Infantry Battalion and went on to fight in the Appomattox Campaign. On May 23–24, the 1st Minnesota Battalion marched in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C. In July, the 1st Minnesota Battalion moved to Louisville, Kentucky for duty. It was mustered out of service upon completion of its enlistment on July 15, 1865 .

=== Post war ===
Post war, both General Hancock and U.S. President Calvin Coolidge were unrestrained in their praise for the actions of the 1st Minnesota. Gen. Hancock, who witnessed the action firsthand, placed its heroism highest in the annals of war: &quot;No soldiers on any field, in this or any other country ever displayed grander heroism.&quot; Gen. Hancock ascribed unsurpassed gallantry to the famed assault stating: &quot;There is no more gallant deed recorded in history.&quot; Emphasizing the critical nature of the circumstances on July 2 at Gettysburg, President Coolidge considered: &quot;Colonel Colvill and those eight companies of the First Minnesota are entitled to rank as the saviors of their country.&quot;

Minnesota has two monuments at the Gettysburg National Military Park. The more grand of the two bears the inscription:

==Casualties==

The 1st Minnesota Infantry suffered the loss of 10 officers and 177 enlisted men killed in action or who later died of their wounds, plus another 2 officers and 97 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 286 fatalities and 609 wounded.

==Continued lineage==
The 2nd Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment, 34th Infantry Division (Minnesota Army National Guard) traces its roots back to the historic 1st Minnesota Volunteers.

<text>Gretchen Frances Wilson (born June 26, 1973, in Pocahontas, Illinois) is an American country music singer and songwriter. She made her debut in March 2004 with the Grammy Award-winning single &quot;Redneck Woman&quot;, a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. The song served as the lead-off single of her debut album, &quot;Here for the Party&quot;. Wilson followed this album one year later with &quot;All Jacked Up&quot;, the title track of which became the highest-debuting single for a female country artist upon its 2005 release. A third album, &quot;One of the Boys&quot;, was released in 2007.

Overall, Wilson has charted 13 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, of which five have reached top ten: the number one &quot;Redneck Woman&quot;, as well as &quot;Here for the Party&quot; (#3, 2004), &quot;When I Think About Cheatin&#x27;&quot; (#4, 2004), &quot;Homewrecker&quot; (#2, 2005), and &quot;All Jacked Up&quot; (#8, 2005). The album &quot;Here for the Party&quot; was certified 5× multi-platinum by the RIAA for sales of five million copies, while &quot;All Jacked Up&quot; was certified platinum. She has sold over 8.2 million records worldwide.

==Country music career==
===&quot;Here for the Party&quot;===

Wilson signed with Epic Records in 2003 and recorded &quot;Here for the Party&quot; within the year. Her first single, &quot;Redneck Woman&quot;, was released in early 2004 and reached the top of the Hot Country Songs charts and No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This song was also the first number one country hit by a female in two years. The success of &quot;Redneck Woman&quot; prompted an earlier-than-planned release for &quot;Here for the Party&quot;, and it debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. It reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and &quot;Billboard&quot; Internet album sales charts. She performed as a support artist for Brooks &amp; Dunn and Montgomery Gentry.

She released the title track to her debut album as the second single. It peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Two other songs were released as singles, and both reached the top 10. Released in markets outside the U.S., the album hit No. 2 on the Australian country charts (behind Kasey Chambers) and the top 50 of the Australian charts. &quot;Here for the Party&quot; was certified 5× multi-platinum by the RIAA.

===&quot;All Jacked Up&quot;===
On September 27, 2005, Wilson released her second album, &quot;All Jacked Up&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 on both the Top 200 and Country album charts and sold 1 million copies. The title track debuted at No. 21 on the Hot Country Songs charts, setting a record for the highest debut ever made by a female artist.

This record was broken in late 2007 by Carrie Underwood&#x27;s &quot;So Small&quot;. Despite its high debut, however, &quot;All Jacked Up&quot; peaked at No. 8 on Hot Country Songs after only eight chart weeks. It was also used, at one time, by ESPN as the opening theme for its baseball coverage. Three more singles were released from &quot;All Jacked Up&quot;: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Loving You Today&quot;, &quot;Politically Uncorrect&quot; (a duet with Merle Haggard) and &quot;California Girls&quot;, none of which reached Top 20 on the country charts. These latter two singles were issued on Columbia Records, due to the closure of Epic Records&#x27;s Nashville division.

Wilson&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Loving You Today&quot; was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, and Best Country Song. In 2006, Wilson contributed a well-received cover of Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Mornin&#x27; Coming Down&quot; on the tribute CD &quot;The Pilgrim: A Celebration of Kris Kristofferson&quot;.

===&quot;One of the Boys&quot;===

On May 15, 2007, Wilson released her third album, &quot;One of the Boys&quot;. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Top 200 and at No. 1 on the Country album chart. After 10 weeks, it exited the Billboard Top 200, having sold 178,220 copies at that point. &quot;Come to Bed&quot; (a duet with John Rich) and the title track, the first two singles released, both peaked in the 30s on the country charts, while the third and final single (&quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Go Home&quot;) failed to reach the Top 40.

===&quot;I Got Your Country Right Here&quot;===
On July 14, 2008, Wilson released a new single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Do Me No Good&quot;. This song was intended to be the lead-off single to a fourth studio album, but it failed to reach the Top 40 and the album was delayed. It was followed in 2009 by two more singles, &quot;The Earrings Song&quot; and &quot;If I Could Do It All Again,&quot; neither of which entered the charts. Wilson then issued a press release on July 28, 2009, stating that she would be parting with Sony Music Nashville. Wilson then launched Redneck Records, her own record label. &quot;Work Hard, Play Harder&quot; was released to radio on October 26, 2009, as the first single from the label and her fourth studio album, &quot;I Got Your Country Right Here&quot;, was finally released on March 30, 2010. Her former label, Columbia Nashville, released her first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album on January 19, 2010, to finish off her recording contract.

On July 31, 2008, The Black Crowes filed a lawsuit against Wilson for copyright violation, alleging that her song &quot;Work Hard, Play Harder&quot; copied the Crowes song &quot;Jealous Again&quot;. Also included in the suit were her label Sony BMG, her publishing company, and the cable network TNT, which had been using the song in commercials. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and Black Crowes members Chris and Rich Robinson were given songwriting credits.

===&quot;Right on Time&quot;, &quot;Under the Covers&quot; and &quot;Christmas in My Heart&quot;===
Wilson released an album of original songs titled &quot;Right on Time&quot; on April 2, 2013. It was led by the single &quot;Still Rollin&#x27;&quot;. A collection of rock covers titled &quot;Under the Covers&quot; was released on June 4, 2013. Wilson released her first Christmas album, &quot;Christmas in My Heart&quot;, on October 8, 2013.

==Other ventures==
===Rock music===
While a country singer first and foremost, Gretchen Wilson has also attracted favorable attention for her rendition of classic rock songs by Heart – a group which she sees as &quot;one of the biggest influences on my musical career&quot;.

She has appeared several times on the same stage as lead singer Ann Wilson and guitarist Nancy Wilson, once describing the experience as &quot;beyond a dream come true&quot;.

She has sung &quot;Straight On&quot;, &quot;Crazy on You&quot;, and – most notably – &quot;Barracuda&quot;, which she performed with Alice in Chains and Nancy Wilson on guitar at the 2007 VH1 Rock Honors. She also performed, with Randy Bachman, the classic Who track &quot;Who Are You&quot; on the album &quot;Who Are You – An All Star Tribute to the Who&quot;. She performed on Buckcherry&#x27;s single &quot;The Feeling Never Dies&quot; (from the album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;), which was released January 29, 2016.

She has sung &quot;Even It Up&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Barracuda&quot; which she performed with Heart, Jerry Cantrell, Dave Navarro, Duff McKagan, Rufus Wainwright and Carrie Underwood at the Decades Rock Live!.

==Activism==
===Politics===
Gretchen Wilson sang the National Anthem (blended with a voice-over of the Pledge of Allegiance) to a national audience at the Republican National Convention on September 3, 2008, later describing this as a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; experience at a &quot;historic moment.&quot; Wilson and her band also performed during a rally for Republican presidential candidate John McCain and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 22, 2008, to a crowd of approximately 12,000 supporters. Palin started the rally by exclaiming that she couldn&#x27;t wait to get Wilson&#x27;s autograph. Wilson played a version of the Heart song &quot;Barracuda&quot; for Palin.

In September 2024 she appeared at a Wisconsin rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump, where she sang &quot;Redneck Woman&quot; and then addressed the crowd from the podium. She said, &quot;the American dream that I have been fortunate enough to find will more most certainly be lost forever if we do not show up and vote for freedom in November. It is on us. Let&#x27;s make sure we, the people, do all we can to save our country by voting for President Trump and JD Vance.&quot;

===Charities and public service===
Wilson has been active in support for children&#x27;s charities, adult education, and the fight against obesity. Initiatives to date include:
* (1) Raising over $1.5 million through benefit performances for children&#x27;s charities, such as St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
* (2) Serving as national spokesperson for Country Bands Together, a national obesity education and counseling/support campaign sponsored by Allergan.
* (3) Advocacy for adult education, including testimony before Congress on the value and importance of support for adult learners. Wilson dropped out of high school while in 9th grade but gained her GED in 2008 through an adult education college.

===Sports===
In , Wilson sang the national anthem before Game 4 of the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Memorial Stadium as a long-time fan of the Cardinals. However, the Red Sox winning the game and sweeping the series made her the anthem singer when the Curse of the Bambino died.

In April 2010, Wilson released a customized version of &quot;Work Hard, Play Harder&quot; in honor of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Nashville Predators, with reworked lyrics mentioning the team and its fans.

She also sponsors a women&#x27;s softball team in Pierron, Illinois.

==Legal issues==
On July 31, 2008, The Black Crowes filed a lawsuit against Wilson for copyright violation, alleging that her song &quot;Work Hard, Play Harder&quot; copied the Crowes song &quot;Jealous Again&quot;. Also included in the suit were her label Sony BMG, her publishing company, and the cable network TNT, which had been using the song in commercials. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and Black Crowes members Chris and Rich Robinson were given songwriting credits.

On August 21, 2018, Wilson was arrested at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Connecticut State Police arrived at the airport after reports of a minor disturbance. Police arrested Wilson after she reportedly became belligerent during their on-tarmac interview. Wilson was charged with breach of peace and her bond was set at $1,000.

<doc id="802094" wikidata="Q661570" url="?curid=802094" title="1986 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1986 Atlantic hurricane season was a very inactive season that produced 10 depressions, 6 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and no major hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1, 1986, and lasted until November 30, 1986. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. During the 1986 season, the first subtropical depression formed in the first week of June, while the last tropical cyclone dissipated at the end of the third week of November. The 1986 season had lower than average activity because of an ongoing El Niño event, and was the least active season in the North Atlantic since the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. This was also the first season since 1972 to have no major hurricanes. 

The season started on June 5 when Subtropical Depression One formed near the Bahamas, which would later gain tropical characteristics and become the first tropical storm of the season; Tropical Storm Andrew. On June 9, Andrew would later be absorbed by a larger low pressure system. On June 23, the season&#x27;s first hurricane formed; Bonnie, although it attained hurricane status on June 25, just two days after Bonnie&#x27;s formation. Two more tropical depressions followed suit later in the season. On August 13, the season&#x27;s fifth tropical depression formed and would later become Hurricane Charley four days later. After Charley dissipated, two more tropical depressions formed on August 31 and September 1. Both dissipated on September 4. On September 7, Tropical Storm Danielle formed and would dissipate on September 10. Just after Danielle dissipated, Hurricane Earl formed and would later become the strongest system of the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season, peaking as a 105 mph Category 2 hurricane and 979 mbars in lowest pressure. No tropical cyclones formed during the months of October and the first half of November. That is, until Hurricane Frances became the latest sixth named storm on record since tropical cyclones were first named in 1950. The season came to a close on November 21, which was when Frances dissipated.


==Seasonal forecast==
Dr. William M. Gray of Colorado State University issued forecasts on May 29 and July 28 indicating within both forecasts the anticipation of a below normal hurricane season. In May, a total of 8 named tropical storms were expected, with four hurricanes expected, 15 days with hurricanes, and a total of 35 days with a tropical storm active in the northern Atlantic Ocean. In July, the numbers were dropped to a total of 7 named storms, 4 hurricanes, 10 hurricane days, and 25 days with a named tropical storm, which almost perfectly verified.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36, which is classified as &quot;below normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.

==Systems==

===Tropical Storm Andrew===

In early June, a large area of disturbed weather persisted over the Greater Antilles, bringing heavy rains to the islands. The area moved northward, developing a circulation over the Bahamas. Strong upper-level winds caused when satellite imagery showed a circulation developing over the Bahamas. Strong upper-level winds caused the structure to resemble a subtropical cyclone, and as a result, the system was classified as a subtropical depression on June 5. The depression moved to the northwest and transitioned into a tropical storm on June 6; it was named Andrew about southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The tropical storm approached the South Carolina coast within before recurving to the northeast on June 7. The storm passed within of Cape Hatteras while recurving, while near its peak intensity of . The storm accelerated to the northeast, briefly crossing into the forecasting territory of Environment Canada, the first of three storms of the season to do so, before ultimately being absorbed by a low pressure system over Canada on June 8.

While active, Andrew posed a threat to the Carolinas. Gale warnings were posted from an area ranging from Cape Lookout to south of Virginia Beach, Virginia on June 7. Waves reached heights of off the coast of the Carolinas, which killed a person on Ocracoke Island. Three companions were also swept out, all of whom made it back to shore. At Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, at least 40 swimmers were caught in the currents, four of whom were hospitalized. The precursor to the storm produced heavy rainfall across Jamaica that caused a deadly flood event.
===Hurricane Bonnie===
During late June, a frontal trough drifted into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, and by June 22 a surface circulation formed. Tracking west-northwestward, it developed into Tropical Depression Two on June 23 while located about 330 miles (535 km) south of Pensacola, Florida. The next day, it attained tropical storm status, and with continued favorable conditions attained hurricane status on June 25 to the south of Louisiana. Bonnie turned to the northwest and made landfall near Sea Rim State Park in Texas. The storm quickly weakened over land as it turned to the north and northeast, and on June 28 it was absorbed by an approaching frontal zone in southeastern Missouri.

Prior to moving ashore, 22,000 people were evacuated. Upon making landfall, Hurricane Bonnie produced a storm surge peaking at 5.2 feet (1.5 m) at Sabine Pass. Rainfall from the storm peaked at in Ace, Texas, which caused some street flooding and destroyed a small dam in Liberty County, Texas. The hurricane also spawned eleven tornadoes, which, in combination with moderate winds, destroyed about 25 residencies in southwestern Louisiana. Three storm deaths occurred in the Port Arthur, Texas area; two deaths occurred from separate car accidents, and another occurred after a partially paralyzed woman died in a house fire. Hurricane Bonnie caused minor damage totaling $2 million (1986 USD, $3.5 million 2006 USD).
===Tropical Depression Three===

The third tropical depression of the season was detected early on July 27 in the open waters of the Atlantic, north of Bermuda. While about north of the island, the storm was moving northward at while its maximum sustained winds were about . Later that afternoon, aircraft reconnaissance found no well-defined circulation and the storm&#x27;s status was reduced from a depression. The depression never threatened any land areas.
===Unnumbered tropical depression===

A tropical disturbance was detected on August 4 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico along the lower Texas coast. The low-pressure system moved slowly toward land, limiting the system&#x27;s development. On August 5, the system became organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. The storm moved inland overnight, dumping several inches of rain over South Texas and causing street flooding in Brownsville and nearby South Padre Island. The system caused rainfall up to in some areas but had no major problems attributed to it. This storm was not carried as a depression operationally, and thus has no assigned number.
===Hurricane Charley===
Hurricane Charley was the first hurricane to threaten the east-central United States since Hurricane Gloria in the previous year. The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Charley formed as a subtropical low on August 13 along the Florida panhandle. A few days later intensified it into a tropical storm off the coast of South Carolina, and Charley attained hurricane status before moving across eastern North Carolina. It gradually weakened over the north Atlantic Ocean before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, though its remnants remained identifiable for over a week until after crossing the British Isles and dissipating on August 30.

The storm brought light to moderate precipitation along its path through the southeastern United States. In Georgia and South Carolina, the rainfall alleviated drought conditions. In North Carolina, where the hurricane made landfall, tidal flooding and downed trees were the primary impact. The storm brought high winds to southeastern Virginia, where 110,000 people were left without power. Minor damage extended along the Atlantic coastline northward through Massachusetts. One traffic fatality was reported each in North Carolina and Virginia. Three people in Maryland died due to a plane crash related to the storm. Throughout the United States, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated $15 million in damage (1986 US$, $29 million 2008 USD).

As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11 deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24‑hour totals, including an accumulation of more than 7.8 in (200 mm) which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, resulting in two rivers overflowing their banks. In the Dublin area, 451 buildings were flooded, some up to a depth of 8 ft (2.4 m). In the United Kingdom, the storm caused downed trees and power lines, as well as flooded rivers.
===Tropical Depression Five===

This tropical depression formed in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean on August 31. The depression moved west-northwest, then northwest away from the Caribbean Sea without further development before dissipating east-southeast of Bermuda on September 4.
===Tropical Depression Six===

A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean sea, moving into a favorable upper environment in the western Caribbean sea on August 31. The system formed into a weak tropical depression before crossing the Yucatán peninsula, becoming better organized as it moved into the south-central and western Gulf of Mexico between September 1 and 3. The system moved ashore east-central Mexico before quickly dissipating as a tropical cyclone on September 4. Satellite imagery revealed that its residual cloud pattern persisted over Mexico for an additional couple of days before degenerating. Heavy rainfall fell primarily north of its track, with the maximum across northeast Mexico falling at El Barranco/Altamira, where a total of was measured.
===Tropical Storm Danielle===
On September 1, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and headed westward. The disturbance was below the 10 degree latitude as it organized into a tropical depression on September 7 and then a tropical storm later that day. Danielle peaked as a storm on September 8, while Reconnaissance Aircraft reported gusts of up to hurricane force. After passing through the Lesser Antilles, Danielle encountered vertical wind shear, and on September 10 it dissipated in the central Caribbean. The remnants continued westward and ultimately regenerated into Tropical Storm Lester.

The islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines experienced wind gusts up to hurricane force, causing severe power outages and causing roof damage. In the Grenadines, the storm drove a coast guard ship aground, while five people were injured and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Torrential rainfall produced several mudslides, which, in turn, damaged roads, bridges, electricity, and water services. Danielle also destroyed twelve homes on the island of Barbados. In Trinidad and Tobago, strong flooding of up to four feet caused 27 landslides, destroying four bridges. The storm caused $8 million in damage in Tobago. Total damage from the storm amounted to $9.2 million (1986 USD), mostly to crops, though no deaths were reported.
===Hurricane Earl===

The strongest storm of the season began as a tropical wave off Africa on September 4. After moving across the tropical Atlantic Ocean it developed into Tropical Depression Eight on September 10 while about 1240 miles (2000 km) east of Puerto Rico. The depression quickly strengthened and reached hurricane strength on September 11, peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on September 12 as it made a half circle, weakened to a Category 1 on September 16 and bounced back the way it came. Earl then turned north and became extratropical southeast of Newfoundland on September 19. At its peak, Earl had sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 979 mbar.
===Hurricane Frances===

First spotted as a tropical disturbance near the Lesser Antilles on November 15, the system moved generally northward while slowly developing. The system organized into a tropical depression on November 18 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm curved northeast and strengthened further, reaching hurricane strength on November 20. However, a surface high-pressure system to the north caused the storm to weaken as the vertical wind shear increased over its center. Frances was later absorbed by an extratropical cyclone on November 21.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1986. This is the same list used for the 1980 season except for Andrew, which replaced &quot;Allen&quot;, and was used for the first time in 1986. No names were retired from this list following the season, and it was used again for the 1992 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the tropical cyclones that formed in the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1986 USD.

<text>The 1985 Atlantic hurricane season was an average, yet destructive year that experienced a near-record number of hurricanes strikes in the United States. It is tied with 2020 and only surpassed by 1886. The season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30. This was partially attributed to a La Niña – a meteorological phenomenon that produces favorable conditions across the Atlantic basin, such as lower wind shear and higher sea surface temperatures. The first storm, Ana, developed on July 15 near Bermuda and caused minor effects in Canada while transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Three other tropical cyclones – Claudette, Henri, and Isabel – did not significantly affect land. Claudette developed offshore of the Southeastern United States and brushed Bermuda and the Azores. Henri and Isabel were dissipating as they approached land. However, the precursor of the latter caused a severe flood in Puerto Rico that killed 180 people. Additionally, Tropical Storm Fabian and three tropical depressions did not have any known impact on land.

Although several storms caused minimal effects, several tropical cyclones also left extensive impact. Hurricane Gloria, the strongest storm of the season, resulted in 14 fatalities and about $900 million (1985 USD) in damage in North Carolina, Virginia, the Mid-Atlantic, and New England. Hurricane Elena threatened the central Gulf Coast of the United States, then abruptly re-curved toward Florida. Unexpectedly, Elena doubled-back and struck Mississippi, resulting in two mass evacuations. The storm caused $1.3 billion in losses, with most of the damage in Louisiana and Mississippi. Similarly, Hurricane Juan caused $1.5 billion in damage due to its erratic track offshore and across Louisiana. Three other tropical cyclones – Hurricanes Bob, Danny, and Kate – caused moderate to extensive damage in Cuba and the United States. Kate was a unusually late and record breaking November hurricane that struck the Florida on the 21st; a record for the latest U.S. hurricane.

Additionally, six hurricanes struck in the United States, which is tied with 2020 for the 2nd highest in a single season. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused over $4.52 billion in damage and 60 deaths.

==Seasonal forecasts==

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. Neither CSU nor WRC issued a forecast on the number of major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. In early 1985, WRC predicted 8 named storms and 5 hurricanes. The CSU forecast for April 1985 was 11 named storms and 8 hurricanes. This forecast was not revised in June. In their August outlook, CSU predicted 10 named storms and 7 hurricanes.
==Season summary==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, but activity in 1985 began more than a month and a half later with the formation of Tropical Storm Ana on July 15. It was an average season in which 13 tropical depressions formed. Eleven of the depressions attained tropical storm status and seven of these attained hurricane status. In addition, three tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status, which is slightly above the 1981–2010 average of 2.7 per season. The amount of activity is attributed to a La Niña that persisted since the previous season. Seven hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 60 deaths and $4.52 billion in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Depression Thirteen, dissipated on December 9, over a week after the official end of the season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development Tropical Storm Ana on July 15. Less than a week later, Hurricane Bob developed in the Gulf of Mexico. Activity briefly halted until Hurricane Claudette formed offshore Georgia on August 9. The month of August also featured Hurricanes Danny and Elena. As September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, it was the most active month. Five tropical cyclones developed, including two tropical depressions, Tropical Storms Fabian and Henri, and Hurricane Gloria. Thereafter, activity began to slow, with Tropical Storm Isabel and Hurricane Juan in October. Another named storm, Hurricane Kate, developed near Puerto Rico on November 15. The final tropical cyclone of the season, Tropical Depression Thirteen, developed in the Caribbean Sea on December 7 and dissipated by late on December 9.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 88, which is classified as &quot;near normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.

==Systems==
===Tropical Storm Ana===

In the second week of July, an area of convection merged with a cut-off low-pressure area, which developed on July 8. After about 7 days, ship data indicated that a circulation developed on July 15. Thus, the system became Tropical Depression One at 1800 UTC that same day, while located south-southeast of Bermuda. The depression slowly curved northwestward around Bermuda and began strengthening. By late on July 16, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. Thereafter, the storm turned northward and passed west of Bermuda later that day. On July 17, Ana accelerate north-northeastward under the influence of a frontal system and eventually paralleled Nova Scotia.

While passing close to Sable Island on July 19, Ana peaked with winds of . Shortly thereafter, the storm merged with frontal system, hours before it crossed the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland. The storm produced relatively light winds on Bermuda, with sustained winds of and gusts up to , causing no damage. Ana and its remnants dropped light rainfall and produced moderate winds on Sable Island and Nova Scotia. On Sable Island, rainfall peaked at , while or less was reported on eastern Nova Scotia. After becoming extratropical, the system dropped slightly heavier precipitation amounts over southeastern Newfoundland, which peaked at . 
===Hurricane Bob===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Two in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on July 21. The depression drifted southeastward and then northeastward without significant intensification. However, late on July 22, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bob. The cyclone made landfall near Fort Myers, Florida with winds of on the following day. While crossing Florida, Bob curved sharply northward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach early on July 24. It continued to strengthen and reached hurricane intensity later that day and peaked with winds of . At 0300 UTC on July 25, Bob made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina at the same intensity. The storm weakened quickly inland and was absorbed by a frontal trough over West Virginia on July 26.

Bob dropped heavy rainfall in South Florida, peaking at in Everglades City. Localized flooding occurred, but was mostly limited to inundated streets and minor damage to crops. Hurricane-force winds were observed in South Carolina. Falling trees and power lines left 32,000 residents without electricity, most of which were in the Charleston area. One person was killed in North Carolina from a traffic accident. The storm produced three tornadoes in Virginia, one of which destroyed two homes and another damaged ten homes. Gusty winds and heavy rainfall also knocked over gateways, tents, and portable toilets at the 1985 Boy Scouts of America National Scout Jamboree at Fort A. P. Hill, injuring several scouts. Four people died in Washington, D.C. and Maryland from traffic accidents caused by slick roads. Overall, Bob caused about $20 million in damage and 5 fatalities.
===Hurricane Claudette===

A trough and an associated low-level circulation were observed over the Gulf Coast of the United States on August 7. The system moved eastward and entered the Atlantic Ocean, where it transitioned into a low-pressure area offshore Georgia on August 9. Around that time, the system developed into a subtropical depression. It strengthened and slowly acquired tropical characteristics while moving east-northeastward. Early on August 11, the depression was reclassified as Tropical Storm Claudette. As the storm passed north of Bermuda late on August 12, minor effects were reported, with sustained winds reaching and rainfall up to . Continuing eastward, Claudette attained hurricane status early on August 14.

At 1200 UTC on August 15, Claudette peaked with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, colder sea surface temperatures caused Claudette to weaken to a tropical storm early on August 16. The storm turned northeast and struck Corvo Island in the Azores later that day. At Lajes das Flores on Flores Island, sustained winds reached , with gusts up to . Furthermore, higher elevations on the island of Flores reported winds as strong as . At 0000 UTC on August 17, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while located north-northeast of the Azores.
===Hurricane Danny===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Four on August 12, while located near Grand Cayman. The depression moved northwestward and initially remained weak. Early on August 13, it brushed Cape San Antonio, Cuba before emerging the Gulf of Mexico later that day. The system then intensified into Tropical Storm Danny on August 14. Danny deepened further and became a hurricane early on the following day, while beginning to re-curve north-northwestward. At 1620 UTC on August 16, Danny attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Only 10 minutes later, the storm made landfall near Grand Chenier, Louisiana at the same intensity. Early on August 17, Danny weakened to a tropical storm and was downgraded to a tropical depression several hours later. It moved east-northeastward across the Southeastern United States, until dissipating over southeastern Virginia on August 18.

There was widespread coastal and inland flooding in Louisiana. The storm brought up to of precipitation to Kentwood. Additionally, there were two tornadoes reported in the state. Overall, 33 single-family homes and 26 mobile homes were destroyed, while 3 condos, 908 single-family houses and 265 mobile homes were damaged. A combination of rainfall and storm surge in southern Mississippi caused severe beach erosion and flooded 70 homes in Hancock County alone. Further north, a tornado in Enterprise severely damaged 6 homes, 3 barns, and 2 roofs; it also destroyed 1 house. In Alabama, the storm spawned 34 tornadoes, which destroyed 27 single-family residences and 18 mobile homes. About 90 homes, 8 mobile homes, and 23 businesses suffered damage. Impact was similar but less severe in several other states, including Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia, and Texas. Danny caused 5 fatalities and about $100 million in damage. 
===Hurricane Elena===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five on August 28, while located near the eastern tip of Cuba. The depression then moved ashore on the island. Despite the mountainous terrain of Cuba, the depression strengthened while tracking west-northwestward across the island. Later on August 28, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Elena. The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Havana early on the following day. Elena reached hurricane status later on August 29. After becoming a Category 2 hurricane, the storm veered east-northeastward and missed the central portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Elena drifted erratically and posed a threat to Central Florida. However, by early on September 1, the storm re-curved to the west-northwest. It continued to intensify and early on the following day, Elena peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . At 1300 UTC on September 2, Elena made landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi at a slightly weaker intensity. The storm rapidly weakened inland, falling to tropical storm status only 5 hours later. It meandered across the Southern United States, until dissipating over Missouri on September 4.

About 1 million fled the coast as Elena approached, with some people undergoing two emergency evacuations due to the erratic path of the storm. Although Elena remained offshore of Florida, it generated large waves along the west coast of Florida. Severe damage occurred to the oyster crop, and of sand was washed away along portions of the Florida Panhandle. Elena also dropped heavy rain in the Big Bend area, where precipitation peaked at in Cross City. Tornadoes in the Tampa Bay area also caused some damage, mostly to mobile home parks. Despite landfall in Mississippi as a Category 3 hurricane, sustained winds in the state only reached , recorded in Harrison County, Ocean Springs, and Pascagoula. Severe wind damage occurred particularly in Pass Christian, where at least 75% of homes suffering losses. Throughout the Gulf Coast region, 294 single family homes were destroyed, while 17,189 were damaged to varying degrees. About 541 mobile homes were destroyed and an additional 2,642 suffered damage. The destruction of 239 apartments and condominiums, as well as impact to 1,909 other units were reported. Elena caused $1.3 billion in damage. In addition, there were nine total fatalities, including two in Texas from storm-induced rip currents; this was considered a low number, most likely the result of the massive evacuations prior to landfall.
===Tropical Storm Fabian===

The remnants of Tropical Depression Six drifted northeastward and crossed Hispaniola on September 15. Later that day, the remnants of the depression emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. It combined with the remnants of a frontal system and quickly developed into a surface low. At 1800 UTC on September 15, Tropical Depression Seven formed about north-northeast of Cockburn Town, Turks and Caicos Islands. The depression was steered northeastward by a frontal trough, which was extending northeastward into the Atlantic. It is estimated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fabian at 1800 UTC on September 16, which was when a reconnaissance aircraft reported an atmospheric pressure of .

At 0700 UTC on September 17, the depression was operationally upgraded to a tropical storm. Fabian strengthened further and at 0945 UTC on that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum atmospheric pressure of . A low-pressure area began developing along the frontal trough, causing the storm to accelerate eastward. The ship &quot;Vant&quot; recorded winds as high as while passing between Fabian and the developing low pressure system on September 17 and September 18. At around 1800 UTC on September 19, Fabian was absorbed by the low-pressure area about southeast of Flores Island, Azores.
===Hurricane Gloria===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight on September 16, while located near Cape Verde. The depression strengthened while passing south of the islands and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gloria on September 17. During the next 24 hours, Gloria did not intensify further and instead weakened back to a tropical depression late on September 18. However, by 0000 UTC on September 20, it re-strengthened into a tropical storm. Slow deepening occurred as the storm approached the Lesser Antilles. Late on September 21, Gloria was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. The storm re-curved west-northwestward by the following day. Gloria then underwent rapid intensification, starting at 1800 UTC on September 23. The storm became a Category 4 hurricane by early on September 25.

At 0120 UTC on September 25, Gloria attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, later that day, the storm quickly weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. Although Gloria weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on September 26, it soon re-strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while re-curving north-northeastward. Early on September 27, Gloria made landfall on Hatteras Island, North Carolina with winds of . After re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, Gloria weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane later on September 27. At 1600 UTC on that day, the hurricane made another landfall on Long Island, New York with winds of . Gloria continued to weaken while moving inland and became extratropical over Maine at 0000 UTC on September 28.

The storm brought strong winds to eastern North Carolina, with sustained winds up to and gusts as high as . Wind damage to trees and structures were reported as far as inland. One man was killed after a tree fell on his mobile home near Havelock. Storm surge amounts ranging from also caused flood damage to numerous homes along the Outer Banks. In New York, wind gusts up to on Long Island damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses. Hundreds of aircraft sustained damage. Thousands of trees were knocked over, which struck power lines, leaving about 1.5 million people – roughly two-thirds of Long Island – without electricity. Storm tides also caused severe beach erosion, flooded hundreds of streets, and damaged or destroyed hundreds of boats. In Connecticut, thousands of trees downed by strong winds struck power lines, leaving up to 727,000 people without electricity. Along the coast, hundreds of small crafts and pleasure crafts were torn from their moorings. Additionally, a number of houses were inflicted flood damage from storm tides. Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Overall, Gloria caused 14 deaths and about $900 million in damage. 
===Tropical Storm Henri===

A trough of low pressure located near dissipating Tropical Storm Fabian developed a circulation on September 18 and then began to drift northward. By 1800 UTC on September 21, the system became Tropical Depression Nine, while located about east of Palm Coast, Florida. However, the advisories were not operationally initiated until 0230 UTC on September 22, after a reconnaissance confirmed a low-level circulation. The depression strengthened and became Tropical Storm Henri early on September 23. Shortly thereafter, Henri attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum atmospheric pressure of .

After reaching peak intensity, wind shear began to steadily weaken the storm as it tracked north or north-northeastward. At 2100 UTC on September 24, Henri made landfall on the eastern tip of Long Island with winds of . While weakening to a tropical depression, the storm made its second landfall near the Connecticut and Rhode Island border around 0000 UTC on September 25. Six hours later, Henri was absorbed by frontal zone centered over New England. Rainfall was widespread, but light, as minimal deep convection was retained as Henri was affecting land. Only one location in both Massachusetts and North Carolina reported precipitation in excess of . As a result, no significant damage was reported.
===Tropical Storm Isabel===
A tropical wave exited Africa on September 29. It entered the Caribbean on October 5 and produced torrential rainfall across Puerto Rico; the floods killed 180 people, mostly from a mudslide near Ponce. On October 7, the wave spawned a tropical depression north of Hispaniola. Located on the western edge of a mid-Atlantic high pressure system, the storm moved northward and intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, although initial development was hampered by interaction with Hispaniola. After moving through the southeastern Bahamas, Isabel quickly intensified and attained peak winds of late on October 8. An approaching cold front caused the storm to weaken and a ridge behind the front caused Isabel to curve westward. In addition, strong southwesterly flow gradually decreased convection around the center.

Isabel made landfall near Fernandina Beach, Florida as a tropical storm late on October 10. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and the circulation turned to the north and east once inland. Late on October 11, Isabel emerged from the coast near Brunswick, Georgia and subsequently drifted to the northeast. The circulation was absorbed by a cold front while located east of the Outer Banks of North Carolina on October 15. When Isabel made landfall on northeastern Florida, the storm dropped light rains across the Southeastern United States, peaking at in southeastern North Carolina. Additionally, minimal precipitation fell in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.

===Hurricane Juan===
An upper-level low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico developed into a tropical depression on October 26. By later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan. Juan re-curved several times, but eventually moved north-northwest on October 27. The storm strengthened and by early on October 28, it became a hurricane. Later that day, sustained winds peaked at . Between October 28 and October 29, the storm executed a cyclonic loop just offshore Louisiana. Shortly before 1200 UTC on that day, Juan made landfall near Morgan City, Louisiana as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened back to a tropical storm. The storm began to execute another cyclonic loop, reaching the Lafayette area before curving back out to the Gulf of Mexico on October 30. The storm briefly remained offshore, before a second landfall on the Mississippi River Delta in Louisiana early on October 31. Juan re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, before yet another landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama. The storm weakened inland and became extratropical over Tennessee on November 1.

Juan produced large waves at oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, causing several damaged platforms, vessels, and killed nine people. The erratic motion of the storm offshore and inland over Louisiana resulted in heavy rainfall, peaking at in Galliano. Significant flood ensued, damaging 5,000 homes and 100 businesses. In Jefferson Parish alone, heavy rainfall and storm surge combined flooded at least 2,233 homes, 3,100 cars, and 100 businesses. In southern Mississippi, rainfall exceeding in some areas inundated 342-352 homes and 6 businesses. The remnants of Juan also produced extensive flooding in the Appalachia region of the United States. Flood levels along rivers such as the James, Potomac, and Roanoke Rivers in Virginia rivaled that of Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the state of Virginia alone, damaged exceeded $800 million. West Virginia was also significantly impacted. Many streams and rivers rose to 100-500 year flood levels, with some cresting at record heights. As a result, whole towns, roads, and bridges were swept away. Nearly 9,000 homes were damaged, 4,000 of which were destroyed. Losses reached $577 million. Overall, Juan caused $1.5 billion in damage and 12 fatalities, including 1 in Texas, 2 in Louisiana, and 9 offshore.
===Hurricane Kate===
The interaction of an upper-level trough and a tropical wave spawned Tropical Storm Kate at 1800 UTC on November 15, while located northeast of Puerto Rico. Kate strengthened while moving westward and was upgraded to a hurricane about 24 hours later. Early on November 19, the storm made landfall in Ciego de Ávila Province, Cuba with winds of . It curved west-northwestward and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico late on November 19. Kate turned northwestward and strengthened, peaking as a Category 3 hurricane on November 20. However, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on November 21, several hours before making landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida. The storm quickly weakened inland and was downgraded to a tropical storm on the following day. It crossed the Southeastern United States and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Fear, North Carolina on November 23. Kate re-curved east-southeastward, before becoming extratropical while located about halfway between the Outer Banks and Bermuda.

In Jamaica, heavy rains brought flooding to five provinces, with repairs to transportation costing $3 million. Additionally, there were seven deaths on the island. In Cuba, strong winds damaged sugar mills and much of the sugar cane crop. An estimated 3,653 mi2 (9461 km2) of sugar cane and 34,000 tonnes of sugar were ruined. The storm also destroyed 141,000 tonnes of bananas and 87,078 tonnes of other fruits and vegetables. Kate damaged 88,207 houses and destroyed 4,382 others. There were 10 deaths and about 50 injuries. Damage was estimated at $400 million. In the Florida Keys, strong winds downed trees and left power outages between Big Pine Key and Key West. Further north in the Florida Panhandle, strong winds also resulted in numerous power outages, including in Tallahassee, where 90% of the city was left without electricity. About 242 buildings were severely damaged in the Florida Panhandle, most of them in Franklin County. Storm surge left about 150 homes uninhabitable in Wakulla County alone. Five deaths occurred in Florida and damage reached about $300 million. One death occurred in Georgia; a man in Thomasville was fatally struck by a falling tree. Heavy rains brought flooding the southern portions of the state, with damage totaling $101 million.
===Other systems===
On September 8, a tropical depression developed about north-northwest of São Vicente, Cape Verde. It tracked west-northwestward and intensified slightly, reaching winds of . However, no further strengthening occurred, and 1200 UTC on September 13, it dissipated while located about east-southeast of Bermuda.

On September 11, Tropical Depression Six formed about north of Tobago. Shortly after developing, it made landfall near Tivoli, Grenada with winds of . The depression remained weak, intensifying minimally and maintaining an ill-defined circulation as it tracked west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea. Eventually, the depression began disorganizing, with convection stretching across Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Leeward Islands on September 14, despite the center being located south of Jamaica. Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft did not indicate a circulation; thus, the depression dissipated while located about south of Kingston, Jamaica on September 14. After dissipating, the depression later redeveloped into Tropical Storm Fabian.
The season&#x27;s final tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on December 7, one week after the official end of the season. It was the first off-season tropical cyclone to develop in the Caribbean Sea since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981. Designated as Tropical Depression Thirteen, it headed west-southwestward toward Panama with little change in strength. At 1800 UTC on December 9, the depression dissipated about northwest of Colón, Panama.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1985. This is the same list used for the 1979 season except for &quot;Danny&quot; and &quot;Fabian&quot;, which replaced &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Frederic&quot;. Both new names were used for the first time in 1985, as were &quot;Isabel&quot;, &quot;Juan&quot;, and &quot;Kate&quot;.

===Retirement===

The World Meteorological Organization retired Elena and Gloria from the naming rotation in the spring of 1986 on account of their severity. They were replaced by &quot;Erika&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; for the 1991 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1985 USD.

<doc id="802103" wikidata="Q2613152" url="?curid=802103" title="Yoh Asakura">
<text>is a fictional character and protagonist of the manga series &quot;Shaman King&quot; created by Hiroyuki Takei. Yoh is a shaman with a lazy demeanor who is accompanied by a six-hundred-year-old samurai ghost, Amidamaru. When first introduced, Yoh appears as a young teenager who wishes to become the &quot;Shaman King&quot;, the world&#x27;s ruler, in an attempt to grant his own wish of living a peaceful life. However, as he befriends more people in the shaman fighting tournament to become the Shaman King, it is revealed Yoh has a twin brother named Hao Asakura whom he wishes to redeem. Yoh also appears in the prequel &quot;Shaman King Zero&quot; and in the sequel &quot;Shaman King Flowers&quot;, with the former being a story about his childhood and the latter being demoting him to cameo appearances as he travels around the world as his son, Hana, takes the leading role.

In the first series, his Japanese voice actress is Yūko Satō, and his English dub voice is provided by Sebastian Arcelus. In the second anime adaptation, Yoh&#x27;s Japanese voice actress is Yōko Hikasa with his English dub voice in that series being provided by Abby Trott. He also appears as the protagonist in all the &quot;Shaman King&quot; video games and appears in multiple crossover fighting games alongside other characters that appeared in the same magazine that &quot;Shaman King&quot; debuted.

Critical reception to Yoh has been mostly positive, based on his interactions with other characters. The pacifism Yoh displays was praised for giving him a more unique trait as he helps to redeem enemies or avoid violence. Merchandising based on him has also been released.

==Creation==
For Takei, Yoh was the hardest character to create; Takei explained that it was difficult to develop Yoh&#x27;s character because of the criteria set by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. The engagement between Yoh and Anna being introduced at the beginning of the story has been regarded as unusual for a shonen manga for its maturity and it partly reflects Takei&#x27;s own personal experience, but it is still an ideal relationship in his opinion. According to Takei, while the protagonist is a projection of himself, Yoh was reenvisioned to make him different. Nevertheless, Takei decided to apply conventions from &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; tropes where Takei creates an axis and Yoh is led to overcome different difficulties.

Takei&#x27;s editor Moriyoshi Yoshida said that Yoh stands out within heroes of the same genre due to his calm personality. This was a surprise to readers at the time. The introduction of a new, never-before-seen type of protagonist grabbed them instantly, and the series quickly became a popular title.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Shaman King&quot;===
Yoh is the protagonist of &quot;Shaman King&quot; who befriends a student from school named Manta Oyamada when defeating local delinquents led by &quot;Wooden Sword&quot; Ryu. Yoh reveals himself to be a shaman with the help of a samurai ghost, Amidamaru. Yoh&#x27;s purpose in coming to Tokyo: he has come to train for the Shaman Fight, an event that where shaman from all over the world will battle to become the god-like Shaman King. In order to ensure the trains properly, Yoh is joined by his fiancée Anna Kyoyama, an itako from Aomori, who drives Yoh relentlessly and brutally so that he may stand up to the powerful opponents he will have to contend with in order to become Shaman King. Despite Yoh&#x27;s claims that he wishes to become Shaman King merely to live an easy life, his primary motivation is the promise he made to Anna whom he met when he was a child. The spirit of Matamune used his power to help Yoh save Anna when the latter&#x27;s powers caused the creation of Onis.

Upon entering the Shaman Fight, Yoh meets a number of the shaman who would become his friends and allies. His mentor Silva teaches Yoh how create an Oversoul, a technique where he merges Amidamaru with his sword Harusame to use it as the main weapon. Upon the second round of the Shaman Fight, Yoh becomes the leader of &quot;Team Funbari Onsen&quot;, which includes Ryu and Faust VIII as his teammates. Anna once again trains Yoh to increase his powers, especially to rival the shaman Hao Asakura who has once tried to win the tournament in his past life but was betrayed by his only friend, Matamune. Using both Harusame and Asakuras&#x27; sword-shaped relic , Yoh creates the giant inspired by Matamune&#x27;s Oversoul.

It is revealed in the series Yoh was born as the younger of a pair of identical twin brothers to Keiko Asakura and Mikihisa Maki. Before Yoh&#x27;s birth, it had been predicted that the family&#x27;s progenitor, Hao, would reincarnate himself for the second time as one of Keiko&#x27;s children and attempt to become Shaman King. The circumstances allowed the Asakuras to spare Yoh as the reborn Hao escapes and Yohmei raised his grandson with the hope that he would be able to defeat Hao. Upon learning of his lineage, Yoh becomes determined not only to stop Hao from realizing his plan to create a shaman only world, but also defeating the darkness in Hao&#x27;s heart.

When briefly training in Hell, Yoh demonstrates a new power known as , which is smaller than his previous Oversouls despite using the same weapons and Amidamaru. In the next round of the Shaman Fight, Yoh convinces his allies to give up and let Hao become the winner. Yoh&#x27;s group enter the Patch Plants to defeat Hao before he becomes the Shaman King, eventually facing all the Patches. Although Yoh&#x27;s group is victorious against all Patch Officers, Hao kills them once he absorbs the Great Spirits. Inside the Grade Spirits, Yoh briefly uses one of the elemental spirits, , provided by Sati to battle Hao. When Hao&#x27;s mind finds peace, Yoh makes peace with his brother and everybody killed by Hao are revived. Several years later, Yoh and Anna have a son named Hana Asakura who is raised by Tamao as the married shamans travel across the world. In the series&#x27; finale, Yoh meets with his son for the first time and has a gathering with his friends.

===Other appearances===
In &quot;Funbari no Uta&quot;, a series of short stories written by Hiroyuki Takei and set six or seven years after the conclusion of &quot;Shaman King&quot;, it is revealed that Yoh and Anna had a son named Hana. The child wields Yoh&#x27;s &quot;Futsunomitama Sword&quot; and travels around with Ryu Umemiya in search of the Five Elemental Warriors. An older Yoh and Anna do not appear until the conclusion of the short series, apparently on their way to Funbari Hill, as they have been traveling around the world in order to resolve various conflicts. In their absence, Hana was raised by Tamao Tamamura with no awareness of who his actual parents are, though Tamao intends to tell him when his parents return at last.

Yoh and Anna also appear in flashbacks in &quot;Shaman King Flowers&quot;, the sequel from &quot;Shaman King&quot; series set years after &quot;Funbari no Uta&quot; with Hana. &quot;Shaman King Flowers&quot; also show Yoh alongside and Anna escaping from unknown enemies during the time Hana was a baby. In these flashback, the family was killed and revived by Hao. When Hana dies once again, he meets Hao who creates a replica of teenage Yoh to test Hana&#x27;s skills.

Yoh appears as a playable character for the Nintendo DS titles, &quot;Jump Superstars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;. He also appears as a main character in the various video games based on the &quot;Shaman King&quot; series.

==Reception==
He has been featured various times in the &quot;Animage&quot;&#x27;s Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters. Merchandise based on Yoh have been released, including action figures, key chains, and plush toys. In a &quot;Shaman King&quot; popularity poll from 2018, Yoh&#x27;s first appearance was voted as the series&#x27; most popular character.

Critical reception to Yoh&#x27;s character has been both positive and negative. Justin Freeman from Anime News Network qualified Yoh as an &quot;easy-going&quot; person. He criticized the fact that &quot;Yoh is a vessel for his ephemeral allies, but in reality, they up end being a vessel for him, to the benefit of no one.&quot; Den of Geek commented that Yoh&#x27;s actions in the first chapters of the manga where he meets spirits in one-shot formats were pointless as it might be the reason why both anime adaptations of the manga removed them in favor of the more important fights he has against Tao Ren and Tao Jun regardless of rushed pacing. Writing for Mania Entertainment, Eduardo Chavez commented that Yoh is &quot;such a laid back casual character&quot;, and that &quot;Yoh&#x27;s attitude to not go beyond his own abilities might be a little lazy&quot; but he thinks that is &quot;a smart approach to conserve mental and physical strength.&quot; Chris Beverdige also from Mania said Yoh is &quot;very much a laid back slacker.&quot; Alexander Hoffman of Comics Village declared &quot;in this first novel, letting the relationships between Yoh, Amidamaru, and Manta flesh out is more important that developing every spiritual entity that shows up.&quot; Active Anime&#x27;s Holly Ellingwood praised the Yoh&#x27;s &quot;much more idealistic and noble [position] than that of his rivals.&quot; While reviewing the manga&#x27;s twenty-second volume, Margaret Veira from Active Anime remarked the scenes in which Yoh starts feeling rage to the point she said &quot;you can feel the anger emanating from the page! It feels so real!&quot; In the book &quot;Summoning the Spirits: Possession and Invocation in Contemporary Religion&quot;, author Andrew Dawson called Yoh the &quot;Japanese Shaman&quot; as he is not based on any religion unlike other characters appearing in the series despite noting some his relationship with the spirit of Amidamaru who is closed on Buddahood. Dawson also praised Yoh&#x27;s character for being relatable with most of the readers of the series.

In the book, &quot;A Gathering of Spirits: Japan&#x27;s Ghost Story Tradition: From Folklore and Kabuki to Anime and Manga Edición Kindle&quot;, Yoh&#x27;s encounter with Faust VIII is compared with a folklore tale about how Buddhists have to accept death to properly appreciate life in contrast to Faust&#x27;s desire to revive his wife. This fight takes place in a Western graveyard unlike previous graveyards shown in the manga which are more Eastern.

Yoh&#x27;s pacifism was compared with that of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; lead Himura Kenshin due to Takei having worked as an assistant to manga author Nobuhiro Watsuki before he started writing &quot;Shaman King&quot;. Anime News Network praised Yoh&#x27;s pacifism for often helping to redeem villains like the cruel Tokageroh who did horrible actions in past life as well as Tao Ren in later episodes as he changes into a more caring person due to Yoh&#x27;s laidback attitude. IGN also enjoyed Yoh&#x27;s laidback attitude especially during fight scenes as tries to avoid harming to avoid his enemies in the process. A reviewer for &quot;The Star&quot; also noted that Yoh&#x27;s pacifism often leads to his former enemies to become kinder as well as become his allies as a result of interacting with them which makes his quest memorable. While criticizing the series for relying on powers in a similar way to the brute force employed in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, Yoh was noted to be an exception to these types of battles as Yoh&#x27;s pacifism leads him to understand his enemies and defeat them without hurting them in the process. Youko Hikasa and Abby Trott&#x27;s performances as Yoh&#x27;s Japanese and English voice actors, respectively, were also the subject of praise.

<text>Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU or Seongdae, ) is a private research university with campuses in Seoul and Suwon, South Korea.

The institution traces its origins to the historic Sungkyunkwan founded in 1398 in central Seoul. As the foremost educational institution during the Joseon period, it was governed by the great code of the state administration with royal assent. By a resolution of the Progressive Intellectuals and Confucian scholars, it was restructured as a comprehensive university in the mid-20th century, and has since greatly expanded its academic offerings.

==History==

Sungkyunkwan was established in 1398 and became the most prestigious educational institution in Joseon. Its name means &quot;to make&quot; (), &quot;harmonious society&quot; (), &quot;institute&quot; ().

The school focused on in-depth study of the Chinese classics, Confucian canon, and contemporary literature; and on how to apply knowledge to governing the nation and to understanding the nature of humanity. It also served as a shrine (see Munmyo) to Confucian sages, and rituals were held regularly to honor them and their teachings.

The school was located within the city walls of Hanseong (modern-day Seoul), Korea&#x27;s capital during the Joseon Dynasty. It followed the example of the Goryeo-period Gukjagam, which in its latter years was also known by the name &quot;Sungkyunkwan&quot;.

Numerous Korean historical figures, including Yi Hwang and Yi I, studied at and graduated from Sungkyunkwan. A considerable amount of Korean literature and works of Hanja calligraphy were created and archived by Sungkyunkwan scholars over the centuries.

The history of Sungkyunkwan University can be divided into the ancient university, modern university, and contemporary university eras.

===Ancient University Era (1398–1894)===

During the ancient university era, traditional Confucian education was practiced.

From the establishment of Sungkyunkwan during the reign of King Taejo to the time of King Seongjong, buildings were constructed, systems were established, operating policies were effected, and the school was cemented as the top national educational center.

A long period of recession followed, from 1495 to 1724, that is, from the time of Yeonsangun to that of Gyeongjong. The beginning of this period was marked by a brief closure due to the tyranny of Yeonsangun, when, in 1505, Sungkyunkwan was reduced to a place to hold feasts. Though it was restored to its original status the next year under King Jungjong, during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), Sungkyunkwan was burnt down and rebuilt.

A period of revival followed, from 1725 to 1894, that is, from the reign of King Yeongjo to the time of Gabo Reform. Education at Sungkyunkwan became lively amid political and academic revival, and reformation of the education system was actively developed by Silhak scholars.

===Modern University Era (1895–1945)===
A period of enlightenment followed, that is, from Sungkyunkwan&#x27;s founding as a modern university (1895) to the Japanese annexation of Korea (1910). In 1895, a three-year department of Chinese classics () was established, and various courses such as history, geography, and mathematics were taught. At the same time, a professor appointment system, admission examination system, and graduation examination system were implemented; a semester system was introduced; and modern institutional reforms such as setting the number of teaching days per year and the number of lecture hours per week were effected. Under Japanese occupation (1910–1945), however, Sungkyunkwan lost its position as the highest school in Joseon.

=== Contemporary University Era (1945–Present) ===
On 15 August 1945, the Japanese Empire was defeated. In November of the same year, Kim Chang-sook led a foundation that revived Sungkyunkwan as an educational center. Sungkyunkwan University was thus re-established by collecting some of the property of the &quot;hyanggyo&quot; and donations from Confucian scholars.

==Partnership with Samsung==
Samsung partnered with SKKU from 1965 to 1977, and renewed this partnership in 1996. The university claims that this has helped it to pursue globalization and to foster talented graduates. The partnership has boosted research infrastructure and human resource management, and it has helped the university to develop courses in software development, mobile communications engineering, energy engineering, nanotechnology, business, medicine, and law.

Through the Samsung Global Scholarship Program, 15–25 students are selected annually for Seoul National University&#x27;s engineering program or to enroll at SKKU&#x27;s Graduate School of Business (SKK GSB), which partners with top business schools abroad, including the MIT Sloan School of Management, Columbia University, Northwestern University&#x27;s Kellogg School of Management, University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business, Dartmouth College&#x27;s Tuck School of Business, Indiana University&#x27;s Kelley School of Business, and the Singapore Management University.

==Rankings and reputation==
According to the ranking of South Korean universities annually published by the national daily newspaper &quot;JoongAng Daily&quot;, Sungkyunkwan University is ranked third in South Korea after Seoul National University and Yonsei University. For several years, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Sungkyunkwan University second in the country.

In the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) world university rankings (2023), SKKU is ranked 99th globally, and 36th in Asia. In the Times Higher Education 2023 world university rankings, SKKU is ranked 170th internationally.

In the Financial Times rankings, SKK GSB&#x27;s MBA ranks 82nd worldwide, 15th in Asia, and first in Korea.

==Campuses and transport==
===Humanities and Social Sciences Campus (Seoul)===
The university&#x27;s Humanities and Social Sciences Campus, also housing arts departments, is in central Seoul on the same hill as Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung (two of the royal palaces of Joseon). The 1,394,154 m2 campus lies in Myeongnyun-dong, near Daehangno. The nearest subway station is Hyehwa on Line 4, and the university operates shuttle buses between the station and the campus.

===Natural Sciences Campus (Suwon)===
The Natural Sciences Campus, housing natural science, engineering, medicine, and sports departments, is within walking distance of Sungkyunkwan University Station in Yuljeon-dong, northwest Suwon. The 101-hectare campus, 45 km south of Seoul, was established in 1978. At 2,199,187 m2, it is more spacious than the campus in Seoul, so sports facilities and a botanical garden are located on this campus.
==Symbols==
SKKU&#x27;s motto is &quot;Humanity, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom&quot; (), and reflects the basic spirit of Neo-Confucianism.

The university&#x27;s symbol—the ginkgo leaf—is derived from the giant ginkgo trees (Natural Monument No. 59) at Myeongnyundang. Both trees are male, and thus do not bear fruit. They are believed to have been planted circa 1519 by Yun Tak, a former chief scholar of Sungkyunkwan.
==Student housing and dormitories==
The university has several on-campus dormitories. The Humanities and Social Sciences campus in Seoul has ten dormitories and housing facilities, namely C-house, E-house, G-house, I-house, K-house, M-house, Crownville A, Crownville C, LWG House, and Victory House, while the Natural Sciences Campus in Suwon has five dormitories, namely In-Kwan, Ui-Kwan, Ye-Kwan, Shin-Kwan and Ji-Kwan.

==Research==
The university spends heavily on research and development, mostly sponsored by Samsung, Hyundai, and government agencies. Notable researchers include Clarivate Citation Laureate Park Nam-Gyu (2017), and physics professor Lee Young-hee, director of the Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics in the Institute for Basic Science. Both scientists frequently publish in &quot;Nature&quot;.

===Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology===

Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) was founded on 1 March 2005 as one of the four core programs of Sungkyunkwan University&#x27;s VISION2010+ plan to be ranked in the top 100 universities in the world. With financial support from Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, it aims to become one of the world&#x27;s top five nanotechnology institutes. The current director of SAINT is Sungjoo Lee.

===N-Center===

The N-Center houses the Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics in the Institute for Basic Science, led by physics Professor Lee Young-hee, and the Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR), led by Prof. Seong-Gi Kim.

===School of Medicine===
Students from the School of Medicine train at Samsung Medical Center&#x27;s hospitals, and many students on campus are first-year undergraduates and postgraduate students.
==International programs==

Over 10% of the university&#x27;s undergraduates are international students. There were over 2,700 international students enrolled at SKKU in 2013, and each year more than 2,000 Korean students from SKKU go abroad. SKKU maintains partnerships with over 653 universities in over 73 countries, and has agreements with 21 overseas institutions to offer dual-degree programs.

==Facilities==
===Libraries===
In 1946, with the re-establishment of the university, Jongyeonggak, Bicheondang and Myeongnyundang were used as libraries until a new library was built. Another library opened on the Natural Sciences Campus in 1979, and a Library of Medicine was established in 1998. In 1999, the Law Library opened, and in 2000, Jongyeonggak was newly established. Samsung Library was built in 2009, and the Central Library was refurbished in 2011. In total, SKKU&#x27;s libraries hold more than 2.15 million books—the ninth largest collection of books in university libraries in South Korea.

==== Samsung Library ====
Built in 2009, this library, alongside typical library functions, houses a digital media room where students can watch movies, and a sleeping arena.
=== Learning Factory ===
SKKU Learning Factory is a student facility at the Natural Sciences campus where creative ideas can be made physically as prototype products using 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC router, and Arduino. The center was established by the Fusion Based Creative Informatics Human Resources Development Team.

===Sports facilities===
Operating under the College of Sports Science, there are several student sports clubs including a baseball club, floor ball club, tennis club, basketball club, soccer club, volleyball club, and cricket club. There is a full-size soccer field, basketball court, tennis courts, athletics track, and baseball fields on the Natural Sciences Campus.

<text>Diodotus II Theos (Greek: , &quot;Diódotos Theós&quot;; died c. 225 BC) was the son and successor of Diodotus I Soter, who rebelled against the Seleucid empire, establishing the Graeco-Bactrian Kingdom. Diodotus II probably ruled alongside his father as co-regent, before succeeding him as sole king around 235 BC. He prevented Seleucid efforts to reincorporate Bactria back into the empire, by allying with the Parthians against them. He was murdered around 225 BC by Euthydemus I, who succeeded him as king. 

Diodotus’ career was recounted by Apollodorus of Artemita in the &quot;Parthian History&quot;, but this text is lost, and surviving literary sources only mention him in passing. Thus, most details of Diodotus&#x27; life and career have to be reconstructed from numismatics.

==Background and co-regency==

The Seleucid empire gained control of Bactria and the surrounding regions between 308 and 305 BC and made it a satrapy (province) of their empire. Diodotus&#x27; father, Diodotus I ruled the region of Bactria as a satrap (governor) some time in the 260s BC and gradually drifted into independence during the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus II Theos (261-246 BC). The process culminated in Diodotus I&#x27;s proclamation of himself as king sometime between 255 and 245 BC.

Coinage minted under Diodotus I derives from two separate mints. The coinage of one mint features a mature man on the obverse—generally identified as Diodotus I, while the obverse of coinage produced at the other mint depicts a similar, but younger, figure. Frank L. Holt proposes that the latter was Diodotus II. He suggests that Diodotus was entrusted with control of a portion of the realm that included the second mint. This arrangement would follow the model laid down by the Seleucids, who had made a practice of appointing the crown prince as co-regent and entrusting them with government of the eastern portion of the empire (including Bactria). The location of the region under Diodotus II&#x27;s control is unknown; Holt tentatively suggests that he controlled the western region which was exposed to raids from Parthia and had his base at Bactra.

==Reign==
During his reign, Diodotus I had expelled the Parni king Arsaces I from Bactria. Arsaces had gone on to seize the region of Parthia from the Seleucids and carved out his own kingdom in what is now northeastern Iran. Diodotus I remained opposed to the Parni and thus aligned with the Seleucids. On his accession, Diodotus II reversed his father&#x27;s policy:

This battle between Seleucus II and Arsaces took place around 228 BC. It is unclear whether Diodotus was actively involved in the battle or simply agreed to remain neutral, thereby leaving Arsaces free to bring all his forces to bear on the invading Seleucid army.

Sometime after this, around 225 BC, Diodotus was killed by Euthydemus I, who usurped the throne and founded the Euthydemid dynasty. W. W. Tarn proposed that Diodotus I had married a Seleucid princess as a second wife and had a daughter who was married to Euthydemus, making him Diodotus II&#x27;s brother-in-law. There is, however, no evidence for the existence of either of these women and the theory no longer enjoys credence with contemporary scholars. Archaeological evidence reveals that the city of Ai-Khanoum was besieged around 225 BC, an event which Holt connects with Euthydemus&#x27; seizure of power. It seems therefore that there was a period of civil war, culminating in Euthydemus&#x27; victory—a reconstruction that seems to be confirmed by numismatic evidence.

Most scholars have treated the alliance with Arsaces as a response to the threat from Seleucus II. Tarn suggested that Euthydemus I&#x27;s usurpation was a reaction to the alliance. Frank Holt proposes the opposite: that the alliance with Arsaces was a response to the outbreak of civil war with Euthydemus.

==Coinage==

Diodotus II largely continued the minting patterns laid down by his father. There were two mints, which issued gold, silver and bronze coinage. The precious metal coinage consisted of gold staters and silver tetradrachms, drachms, and hemidrachms on the Attic weight standard. These coins have the head of a male figure on the obverse shown wearing the diadem—a band of cloth wrapped around the head, with two strips hanging down the back, which had been the standard symbol of Hellenistic kingship since the time of Alexander the Great. The reverse of these coins depicted Zeus preparing to throw his thunderbolt. As mentioned above, during Diodotus I&#x27;s reign, two different figures appeared on the obverses—an older figure (&#x27;series A&#x27;) and a younger figure (&#x27;series C &amp; E&#x27;), who are identified with Diodotus I and Diodotus II respectively. Series A and C probably minted at Ai-Khanoum or at Bactra, while Series E was minted at a second mint, which Frank Holt tentatively identifies with Bactra. This mint produced coinage in a smaller quantity and at a lower quality than that of the Ai-Khanoum/Bactra mint. He proposes that the small series C was minted at the main mint in order to establish Diodotus II&#x27;s position as heir apparent of the whole kingdom.

After a break, both mints produce coins with the younger portrait and with the legend now (&#x27;Of Diodotus&#x27;, &#x27;series D &amp; F&#x27;), whereas the legend on the earlier coins was (&#x27;Of King Antiochus&#x27;). Holt suggests that this break marks the death of Diodotus I and accession of Diodotus II. This shift in legends seems to reflect the final renunciation of Seleucid authority and a full proclamation of Bactrian independence.

For the majority of his reign, Diodotus II issued coinage on a relatively modest scale. Towards the end of his reign, he began to mint on a much larger scale, with greater quantities of gold coinage than previously. This was accompanied by the production of an issue at the secondary mint, depicting the older figure of Diodotus I once more, but in a more idealised fashion (&#x27;series B&#x27;). Frank Holt proposes that these phenomena were a consequence of a civil war between Diodotus II and Euthydemus. He argues that the scale of minting indicates the need to provide coinage for a large number of soldiers—indicating some kind of military threat—while the series B coinage may have been intended to emphasise Diodotus II&#x27;s legitimacy as son of the kingdom&#x27;s founder.

Diodotus II also issued a bronze coinage. Initially, this coinage bore the same obverse design as that of Diodotus I: head of Hermes wearing a petasus hat (&#x27;Series H&#x27;). However, the reverse design is new: a depiction of Athena resting on her spear and the introduction of a new legend, reading (&quot;of King Diodotus&quot;), as on the gold and silver coinage. The coinage consisted of four denominations: a &#x27;double&#x27; (c. 8.4 grammes, 20-24 millimetres in diameter), a &#x27;single&#x27; (4.2 g, 14–18 mm), a &#x27;half&#x27; (2.1g, 10–12 mm), and a &#x27;quarter&#x27; (1 g, 8–10 mm). Only the first two of these denominations seem to be attested under Diodotus I. The value of these denominations is uncertain; a single may have been worth 1/48 of a silver drachm. After this initial issue, Diodotus introduced a new set of designs (&#x27;Series I&#x27;). On the double and single denominations, these depict the head of Zeus on the obverse (except on one issue depicting a king—probably by accident), and the goddess Artemis on the reverse. On the quarters, they have an eagle on the obverse and a quiver on the reverse (symbols of Zeus and Artemis respectively). These bronze coins were found in very large numbers in the excavations of Ai-Khanoum and in smaller quantities at Gyaur Gala (Merv, Turkmenistan) and Takht-i Sangin. The profusion of bronze coinage, whose value was token, especially in the very smallest denominations, indicates the progressive monetisation taking place in Bactria by the time of Diodotus II.

Diodotus also appears on coins struck in his memory by the later Graeco-Bactrian kings Agathocles and Antimachus I. These coins imitate the original design of the tetradrachms issued by Diodotus II, but with a legend on the obverse identifying the king as (&#x27;Of Diodotus Theos&#x27;).

<text>A security agency is a governmental organization that conducts intelligence activities for the internal security of a state. They are the domestic cousins of foreign intelligence agencies, and typically conduct counterintelligence to thwart other countries&#x27; foreign intelligence efforts.

For example, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is an internal intelligence, security and law enforcement agency, while the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is an external intelligence service, which deals primarily with intelligence collection overseas. A similar relationship exists in Britain between MI5 and MI6.

The distinction, or overlap, between security agencies, national police, and gendarmerie organizations varies by country. For example, in the United States, one organization, the FBI, is a national police, an internal security agency, and a counterintelligence agency. In other countries, separate agencies exist, although the nature of their work causes them to interact. For example, in France, the Police nationale and the Gendarmerie nationale both handle policing duties, and the Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur handles counterintelligence. Some nations, such as the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey, have one agency that is responsible for both security and intelligence.

Likewise, the distinction, or overlap, between military and civilian security agencies varies between countries. In the United States, the FBI and CIA are civilian agencies, although they have various paramilitary traits and have professional relationships with the U.S.&#x27;s military intelligence organizations. In many countries all intelligence efforts answer to the military, whether by official design or at least on a de facto basis. Countries where various military and civilian agencies divide responsibilities tend to reorganize their efforts over the decades to force the various agencies to cooperate more effectively, integrating (or at least coordinating) their efforts with some unified directorate. For example, after many years of turf wars, the member agencies of the United States Intelligence Community are now coordinated by the Director of National Intelligence, with the hope to reduce stovepiping of information.

In Ireland, for example, intelligence operations relevant to internal security are conducted by the military (G2) and police (SDU), rather than civilian agencies.

Security agencies frequently have &quot;security&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;service&quot; in their names. Private organizations that provide services similar to a security agency might be called a &quot;security company&quot; or &quot;security service&quot;, but those terms can also be used for organizations that have nothing to do with intelligence gathering.

==Security agency vs. secret police==

There is debate about whether some security agencies should be characterized as secret police forces. The extent to which security agencies use domestic covert operations to exert political control varies by country and political system. Such operations can include surveillance, infiltration, and disruption of dissident groups, attempts to publicly discredit dissident figures, and even assassination or extrajudicial detention and execution. Security agencies are constrained in some countries by a mesh of judicial and legislative accountability, whereas in others they may answer only to a single leader or executive committee.

<text>A formicarium (: formicaria or formicariums) or ant farm is a vivarium which is designed primarily for the study of ant colonies and how ants behave and for the enjoyment of ants as pets. Those who study ant behavior are known as myrmecologists.

==History==
The formicarium was invented by Charles Janet, a French entomologist and polymath, who had the idea of reducing the three dimensions of an ant nest to the virtual two dimensions between two panes of glass. His design was exhibited in the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. Janet&#x27;s invention was recognized by his promotion to Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honour, but he did not obtain a patent for, nor attempt to market his creation.

The first commercially sold formicarium was introduced around 1929 by Frank Eugene Austin (1873–1964), an inventor and professor at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. Austin received a patent for his formicarium on June 16, 1931, as well as further patents for its continued development. Austin included whimsical painted or wooden scenes of palaces, farms and other settings above the ground level.

In 1956, Milton Levine, founder of Uncle Milton Industries, created his own version of a formicarium, reportedly independently from Frank Austin. Levine got the idea when attending a Fourth of July picnic. Levine registered the term &quot;ant farm&quot; for his product and registered it as a trademark. Austin may not have used this term; in his patents, the formicarium is referred to as an &quot;educational apparatus&quot; and &quot;scenic insect cage&quot;, and in the 1936 magazine article about Austin&#x27;s device, the structure is called an &quot;ant palace&quot;.

Levine&#x27;s &quot;Ant Farm&quot; trademark received notoriety in 1995 when Scott Adams used the phrase in a &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic and received threatening letters from Uncle Milton Industries&#x27; attorneys, demanding a retraction for the unauthorized use of the phrase. Adams satirized the incident in a later comic strip, in which Dilbert asked for a substitute phrase for &quot;a habitat for worthless and disgusting little creatures&quot;, to which Dogbert replied &quot;law school&quot;.

==Materials==
Most formicarium types now available on the market are either made of acrylic (plastic) or 3D printed. These are superior to the &#x27;sandwich&#x27; type formicarium as there is no chance of tunnel collapse, and they are designed more specifically to keep queen ants with workers, whereas the &#x27;Milton&#x27; type nests were only designed to house worker ants.

A &#x27;sandwich&#x27; formicarium is usually a transparent box made of glass or plastic, made thin enough so that the tunnels and cavities made by the ants can be seen and their behaviour can be studied. The fill material is typically soil, loam, sand, vermiculite, other mineral fragments or sawdust.

Formicariums containing gel that act both as fill material and partially food are available. However, they do not provide the ants with adequate housing and nutrition for the long term and in some instances, they can actually be poisonous to the ants. The formula and nutritional content of gels vary, but for worker-only colonies they tend to only contain sugar or agar plus preservatives. Most gels are colored blue.

Other types of formicaria are those made with plaster, autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) or simply with no medium. Plaster nests can be made by placing modeling clay on a glass panel in the form of tunnels and chambers. The plaster is poured onto the mold, and when the plaster dries, the clay is removed and the remaining structure can be used for housing ants. The ants in this type of formicarium are very easily seen. Mediumless formicaria may be in any container, with the ants staying in moist test tubes or other small containers. This also allows for better visibility.

A formicarium can be designed to be free-standing, and not enclosed or lidded like a vivarium. A free-standing design does not require high walls and a lid, but rather relies on barriers to secure the ants within their habitat.

Containing ants inside a formicarium can be a challenge. Several substances are used to repel the ants, including anti-escape oil, petroleum jelly or liquid PTFE, which are applied to the side of the formicarium to prevent escape, as most ant species cannot walk on these slippery or sticky surfaces. Despite this, some species of ants can build bridges of debris or dirt on the substance to escape, while in other species some individual ants can walk on the substance without impedance. Formicarium owners often make use of two or more security measures. Another escape-prevention technique involves placing the entire formicarium in a shallow container of water, creating a moat.

Some ant-keepers choose to put their ants into a &#x27;test tube outworld&#x27; before a formicarium as this allows them to keep the colony comfortable and safe within their test tube whilst also allowing them a foraging area.

== Laws on keeping ants ==
In the United States, it is usually illegal to ship live queen ants across state lines without a permit, and most ant farms sold in the US contain no queens. Professional ant shops and suppliers may ship ants only within the state where they reside.

In the European Union, some domestic species are protected, and it is illegal to own, keep, buy, or sell these ants, or to damage their nests. Unlike reptiles and spiders, there are no laws on owning, keeping, buying, or selling tropical ants. Most formicaria are designed to house queen ants; professional ant shops and suppliers usually sell their colonies with queens.

<text>Directorate &quot;V&quot; of the FSB Special Purpose Center, often referred to as Spetsgruppa &quot;V&quot; Vympel (pennant in Russian, originated from German , and having the same meaning), but also known as KGB Directorate &quot;V&quot;, Vega Group, is a stand-alone sub-unit of Russia&#x27;s special forces within the Russian Special Forces Center of the Federal Security Service (FSB).
Vympel is the sister unit of Spetsgruppa &quot;A&quot; (Alpha Group), an FSB unit.

== Origins ==
=== KUOS ===
As most of the training in the KGB academy concentrated on plainclothes operational work focused on espionage and counter-espionage, in 1955 the First Chief Directorate of the service established the Development Courses for Officer Personnel ( (), Latinized abbreviation KUOS) – a training cadre with the purpose of training general duty KGB officers in irregular warfare and combat tactics for clandestine operations overseas or as a stay-behind cadre and backbone for the formation of partisan units in case of a foreign invasion. In 1966 these courses were taken out of the structure of the First Chief Directorate and co-located as an independent training center together with the training center of the Soviet Border Troops (the KGB&#x27;s own military force) in Golitsyno, Moscow Oblast. The KUOS graduates had their baptism by fire during the Prague Spring in 1968. A year later the KUOS was absorbed into the KGB Academy (Higher Red Banner School of KGB of the USSR, ) as part of the students&#x27; curriculum – initially a three-month course. In 1970 the KUOS relocated again to Balashikha, the position of the director was promoted from a KGB Major/Captain 2nd Rank to a KGB Colonel/Captain 1st Rank and the duration of the training increased to seven months.

=== Zenyth ===
The main purpose of the KUOS center was the regular and irregular combat training of KGB Academy cadets as part of the establishment&#x27;s curriculum. The secondary purpose was in case of a rising tension in a specific region to generate a tailored task group out of the cadets currently in an advanced stage of their training. Such example is the Operation Storm-333 (), which gained a legendary status in Russia. From the cadre of KUOS the Special Operations Task Group Zenyth was formed to take part in the liquidation of the Afghan leader Hafizullah Amin alongside the Grom Team (Russian for &quot;thunder&quot;) of the KGB&#x27;s Alpha Group. The Zenyth Task Group was headed personally by the director of KUOS Colonel Grigoriy Boyarinov (who was in charge of the KUOS since it became an independent structure in 1969). Since Hafizullah Amin came to power by ordering the assassination of his predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki and fearing he would be ousted from power the same way he asked the Soviet government to provide his protective detail. The combined KGB Grom and Zenyth contingent was deployed in that role, wearing Afghan army uniforms without identification. Later, when the Soviet leadership re-evaluated the situation and ordered a military intervention the dual characteristics of those KGB officers as intelligence operatives with advanced combat training and their location within the Presidential Palace made them ideal to both gather intel on the actions of the Afghan leadership and spearhead the assault on the residence, opening the way for the &quot;Muslim Battalion&quot; (154th Special Operations Independent Force – ) of the GRU Spetsnaz. Col. Boyarinov was killed in the fighting along with 5 operatives of Grom and Zenyth. Storm-333 is a rare example of KGB Spetsnaz and GRU Spetsnaz operating in concert.

=== Kaskad and Omega ===
After the full-sized invasion of Soviet forces within the Afghan People&#x27;s Republic in July 1980 the KGB ordered the KUOS to form another special operations task force - Kaskad (, Russian for &quot;cascade&quot;). From July 1980 until April 1983 the Kaskad made four tours to Afghanistan in different composition and with different duration, so the four task forces are known simply as Kaskad-1 (6 months), Kaskad-2 (6 months), Kaskad-3 (9 months) and Kaskad-4 (12 months). Unlike the CIA the KGB operated both in intelligence and counter-intelligence capacities, so in contrast to the Zenyth Task Group, which was tailored to a specific operation and concentrated on intelligence gathering, the Kaskad Task Groups were organised to provide support to the KGB counter intelligence operatives in theater, suppressing covert activities in the towns and hunting down agents cross-country. In addition those task groups had the mission to select, train and mentor groups of Afghans which would take over their duties once the Kaskad is brought back to the Soviet Union and dissolved. 

In April 1983 the Kaskad-4 was relieved by the Omega Special Operations Task Group () with the same tasks as the Kaskad teams. The name of the task force (the last letter in the Greek alphabet) indicated it to be the last unit of that sort to be deployed to Afghanistan. Omega was composed of 9 mobile special operations task groups (8 located in the interior of the country, the ninth group located together with the unit HQ in Kabul). This task group concluded the building of local Afghan capabilities within the Afghan Counter-Intelligence Service KAM and its Special Operations Tasks Battalion to take over the responsibilities of the KGB assets deployed on site.

== Formation ==
Vympel follows the lineage of Zenyth, Kaskad and Omega combined. On August 19, 1981 at a classified meeting the Soviet government made the decision for a permanent Special Operations Task Group within the KGB&#x27;s First Chief Directorate. The new group was formed around the cadre of Zenith, Kaskad-1 and Kaskad-2 in order to retain the proficiency level of the operatives and to retain the lessons learned in the process of fighting irregular warfare in Afghanistan.

The founding commander of Vympel is Captain 1st Rank Ewald Kozlov, a graduate of the Baku Naval Officer School, with a service career in the Northern Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. In 1968 he entered the Soviet Military Academy and the Military Diplomatic Academy (the training establishment of the GRU) after that, graduating in 1970. Right after that Kozlov transferred from the Soviet Armed Forces to the KGB, entering the First Chief Directorate&#x27;s Department &quot;S&quot; (overseas illegal operatives). In 1972 he became an instructor at the KUOS. In 1979 he deployed with Zenyth to Afghanistan. Upon his return to the Soviet Union he headed the KUOS, a position vacated by the death of Col. Boyarinov in Operation Storm-333. Named Vympel&#x27;s first commander, he was replaced in 1985 and promoted to the Headquarters of First Chief Directorate.

With its formation the Vympel Special Operations Task Group was put under the command of First Chief Directorate&#x27;s Department &quot;S&quot; - the KGB&#x27;s overseas clandestine service () under the covert name Independent Training Center ( ()). The new unit&#x27;s mission statement was ordered as follows:
* intelligence gathering deep within the enemy&#x27;s rear ()
* human intelligence (HUMINT) () 
* diversion and assault in strategic locations of the enemy ()
* seizure of enemy surface vessels and submarines ()
* security of Soviet diplomatic locations overseas ()
* combat against terror organisations () and other tasks.

The unit was formed in 1981 by the KGB Maj. Gen. Yuri Ivanovich Drozdov within the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, as a dedicated spetsnaz unit specialised in deep penetration, sabotage, universal direct and covert action, protection of Soviet embassies and espionage cell activation in case of war. Most of the Vympel operatives mastered two or three foreign languages since they were intended to act in foreign countries, deep behind enemy lines. Vympel was tasked with assassinating the top leadership of enemy states and destroying strategic infrastructure in the critical &quot;special period,&quot; when the outbreak of war between the superpowers would have been unavoidable.

Vympel quickly gained the reputation of being among the best Soviet special forces units, surpassing its GRU and MVD counterparts. However, after the collapse of the USSR, Vympel was decimated by endless re-organisation and re-definition. It passed under the aegis of the Security Ministry before being receded to the GUO (the two institutions were short-lived offspring of the ex-KGB during the Boris Yeltsin era) and finally passed to the MVD (Interior Ministry). However, the &quot;militsiya&quot; had no use for such a unit. The bulk of the Vympel operatives could not stand the humiliation of being subordinated to the police, and duly resigned: of 278 officers, only 57 chose to remain within the MVD. The unit was renamed &quot;Vega.&quot;

In 1995, the FSB RF Special Operations Center (TsSN FSB RF) was granted control over Vympel. The group regained its original name and was reintegrated into the Intelligence Service structures. The emphasis shifted from covert and clandestine sabotage operations to counter-terrorism and nuclear safety enforcement. Vympel operatives undergo special training related to improvised or special explosive devices, permitting them to use &quot;terrorist-like&quot; tactics to carry out their operations. Physical training includes close hand combat, parachute training, diving, underwater combat techniques, climbing, and alpine rope techniques. Regional groups of Vympel were deployed in cities with especially important nuclear facilities.

Vympel, abbreviation of the Directorate в (Russian Cyrillic for V) of the TsSN FSB of the Russian Federation, is still a classified and secretive unit. It took part in Russia&#x27;s Chechen campaigns and in storming of the Supreme Soviet building during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. Little is known about its current operations and activities, with the exception being the capture of the Chechen militant leader Salman Raduyev in March 2000 and the assault on the school in Beslan in September 2004.

Vadim Krasikov, who was named as a suspect in the murder of a Russian businessman in 2013 in Moscow and as 2022 convicted murderer of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, is - according to investigations by Bellingcat - suggested a member or former member of Vympel.

<text>A rhinoceros ( ; ; ; : rhinoceros or rhinoceroses), commonly abbreviated to rhino, is a member of any of the five extant species (or numerous extinct species) of odd-toed ungulates (perissodactyls) in the family Rhinocerotidae; it can also refer to a member of any of the extinct species of the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea. Two of the extant species are native to Africa, and three to South and Southeast Asia.

Rhinoceroses are some of the largest remaining megafauna: all weigh over half a tonne in adulthood. They have a herbivorous diet, small brains for mammals of their size, one or two horns, and a thick , protective skin formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter when necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths; they rely instead on their lips to pluck food.

Rhinoceroses are killed by poachers for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market for high prices, leading to most living rhinoceros species being considered endangered. The contemporary market for rhino horn is overwhelmingly driven by China and Vietnam, where it is bought by wealthy consumers to use in traditional Chinese medicine, among other uses. Rhino horns are made of keratin, the same material as hair and fingernails, and there is no good evidence of any health benefits. A market also exists for rhino horn dagger handles in Yemen, which was the major source of demand for rhino horn in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Taxonomy and naming ==

The word &quot;rhinoceros&quot; is derived through Latin from the , which is composed of (&quot;rhino-&quot;, &quot;of the nose&quot;) and (, &quot;horn&quot;) with a horn on the nose. The name has been in use since the 14th century.

The family Rhinocerotidae consists of only four extant genera: &quot;Ceratotherium&quot; (white rhinoceros), &quot;Diceros&quot; (black rhinoceros), &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; (Sumatran rhinoceros), and &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (Indian and Javan rhinoceros). The living species fall into three categories. The two African species, the white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros, belong to the tribe Dicerotini, which originated in the middle Miocene, about 14.2&quot; &quot;million years ago. The species diverged during the early Pliocene (about 5 million years ago). The main difference between black and white rhinos is the shape of their mouths – white rhinos have broad flat lips for grazing, whereas black rhinos have long pointed lips for eating foliage. There are two living Rhinocerotini species, the Indian rhinoceros and the Javan rhinoceros, which diverged from one another about 10 million years ago. The Sumatran rhinoceros is the only surviving representative of the Dicerorhinini.
A subspecific hybrid white rhino (&quot;Ceratotherium s. simum&quot; × &quot;C. s. cottoni&quot;) was bred at the Dvůr Králové Zoo (Zoological Garden Dvur Kralove nad Labem) in the Czech Republic in 1977. Interspecific hybridisation of black and white rhinoceroses has also been confirmed.

While the black rhinoceros has 84 chromosomes (diploid number, 2N, per cell), all other rhinoceros species have 82 chromosomes. Chromosomal polymorphism might lead to varying chromosome counts. For instance, in a study there were three northern white rhinoceroses with 81 chromosomes.

== Anatomy ==
Rhinoceroses are among the largest living land animals, with living species ranging in average weight from in the Sumatran rhinoceros, to in the white rhinoceros. Some extinct rhinocerotids were considerably smaller and larger than living rhinoceroses, with the genus &quot;Menoceras&quot; from the Early Miocene of North America having an estimated body mass of , comparable to sheep, or a pig, while &quot;Elasmotherium sibiricum&quot; from the Pleistocene of Eurasia has an estimated body mass of approximately . The skulls of rhinoceroses are generally saddle-shaped and low, with rhinoceroses being primitively characterised by the presence of a chisel-shaped upper first incisor (I1) and a tusk-like lower second incisor (i2), with all other incisors and the canines typically being lost. Black and white rhinoceroses completely lack incisors. Living rhinoceroses have either one or two horns, which are formed from columns of densely packed corneocytes originating from dermal papillae. The development and growth of rhinoceros horns is similar to that of human nails, with both being largely made of keratin. The horns are attached to a rugose (roughly textured) area on the surface of the skull. Horns are not a universal feature of rhinocerotids, with horns thought to be absent in many extinct rhinocerotids (such as most members of the subfamily Aceratheriinae). The brains of rhinoceroses are relatively small compared to body size, around in an adult black rhinoceros. The limb bones tend to be robust (proportionally thick and stocky). All living and the vast majority of extinct rhinoceroses have three toes on each foot. The body is covered in an armour of thick skin made of a dense crosslinked network of collagen fibres that is stronger and stiffer than those of other mammals. The skin exhibits prominent folding. The skin in living species is grey to brown in colour, and typically sparsely covered in hair or hairless as adults, with the exception of the eyelashes, ears, and the tail-brush. The exception is the Sumatran rhinoceros, which is often covered with a considerable amount of hair.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Living rhinoceroses&#x27; gregariousness varies between species. Adult males tend to be solitary, and this is also true of female Asian rhinoceroses, though the females of African species sometimes form groups, with these groups being more common in white than black rhinoceroses. Rhinoceroses have widely varying diets ranging from strict grazing (such as the white rhinoceros) to largely browsing (such as the black rhinoceros) to a mixture between both (the Sumatran and Javan rhinoceros). As bulk feeders of low quality vegetation, rhinoceroses spend a majority of their time foraging. Rhinoceroses are hindgut fermenters.

All living rhinoceroses have a polyandrous and polygnous mating system where both males and females seek to mate with multiple individuals of the opposite sex. Male rhinoceroses guard reproductive age females until they are in full estrous though the females sometimes may drive away males until they are receptive. Male rhinoceroses taste the urine of female rhinoceroses and perform a flehmen response with the upper lip to determine their reproductive status. Adult males in the vicinity of oestrous females may become aggressive towards other males. These confrontations can range from ritualized behaviour to serious fighting that can result in significant injuries. In some species, male rhinoceroses are territorial, while in other species they are not or are only territorial depending on local environmental conditions. Females will sometimes reject males they consider undesirable, which results in them fleeing or fighting the male if cornered. During copulation, the male slides his neck up the back of the female, before using his neck as a lever to get his forelegs off the ground, before moving the front legs behind the shoulders of the female. Copulation can last several hours. Pregnancy lasts for over a year, around 460 days in the black rhinoceros and 504 days in the white rhinoceros. The female generally gives birth in a secluded area and becomes aggressive towards other rhinoceroses for a while after giving birth. Calves typically stand up within 30 minutes of birth and begin to suck on their mother&#x27;s teats within two hours of birth. The mother generally has a strong bond with her most recently born calf. The calf generally remains close to its mother the majority of the time, although at least in some species they are sometimes left considerable distances away. Up until they are around three years old, juvenile rhinoceroses are vulnerable to predation. Mothers are vigorously protective of their calves against potential predators. Juvenile one-horned rhinoceroses are rejected by their mothers around the time of the birth of her next calf. There is generally a gap of several years between females giving birth again after having her previous calf, though the gap can be as short as a year and a half. Rhinoceroses become sexually mature at around five to eight years of age, generally around a year later in males than in females in black and Sumatran rhinoceroses, though male white rhinoceroses become socio-sexually mature at around 12 years of age, four years after females start giving birth.

== Extant species ==
=== White ===

There are two subspecies of white rhinoceros: the southern white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum simum&quot;) and the northern white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum cottoni&quot;). As of 2013, the southern subspecies has a wild population of 20,405—making them the most abundant rhino subspecies in the world. The northern subspecies is critically endangered, with all that is known to remain being two captive females. There is no conclusive explanation of the name &quot;white rhinoceros&quot;. A popular idea that &quot;white&quot; is a distortion of either the Afrikaans word &quot;&quot; or the Dutch word (or its other possible spellings , , etc.,), meaning &quot;wide&quot; and referring to the rhino&#x27;s square lips, is not supported by linguistic studies.

The white rhino has an immense body and large head, a short neck and broad chest. Females weigh and males on average, though exceptional specimens can reportedly weigh up to . The head-and-body length is and the shoulder height is . On its snout it has two horns. The front horn is larger than the other horn and averages in length and can reach . The white rhinoceros also has a prominent muscular hump that supports its relatively large head. The colour of this animal can range from yellowish brown to slate grey. Most of its body hair is found on the ear fringes and tail bristles, with the rest distributed rather sparsely over the rest of the body. White rhinos have the distinctive flat broad mouth that is used for grazing.

=== Black ===

The name &quot;black rhinoceros&quot; (&quot;Diceros bicornis&quot;) was chosen to distinguish this species from the white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;). This can be confusing, as the two species are not truly distinguishable by color. There are four subspecies of black rhino: South-central (&quot;Diceros bicornis minor&quot;), the most numerous, which once ranged from central Tanzania south through Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to northern and eastern South Africa; South-western (&quot;Diceros bicornis occidentalis&quot;) which are better adapted to the arid and semi-arid savannas of Namibia, southern Angola, western Botswana and western South Africa; East African (&quot;Diceros bicornis michaeli&quot;), primarily in Tanzania; and West African (&quot;Diceros bicornis longipes&quot;) which was declared extinct in November 2011. The native Tswanan name &quot;keitloa&quot; describes a South African variation of the black rhino in which the posterior horn is equal to or longer than the anterior horn.

An adult black rhinoceros stands high at the shoulder and is in length. An adult weighs from , exceptionally to , with the females being smaller than the males. Two horns on the skull are made of keratin with the larger front horn typically long, exceptionally up to . Sometimes, a third smaller horn may develop. The black rhino is much smaller than the white rhino, and has a pointed mouth, which it uses to grasp leaves and twigs when feeding.

During the latter half of the 20th century, their numbers were severely reduced from an estimated 70,000 in the late 1960s to a record low of 2,410 in 1995. Since then, numbers have been steadily increasing at a continental level with numbers doubling to 4,880 by the end of 2010. As of 2008, the numbers are still 90% lower than three generations ago.

=== Indian ===

The Indian rhinoceros, or greater one-horned rhinoceros, (&quot;Rhinoceros unicornis&quot;) has a single horn 20 to 60 cm long. It is nearly as large as the African white rhino. Its thick, silver-brown skin folds into the shoulder, back, and rump, giving it an armored appearance. Its upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart-like bumps, and it has very little body hair. Grown males are larger than females in the wild, weighing from . Shoulder height is . Females weigh about and are long. The record-sized specimen was approximately .

Indian rhinos once inhabited many areas ranging from Pakistan to Myanmar and maybe even parts of China. Because of humans, they now exist in only several protected areas of India (in Assam, West Bengal, and a few pairs in Uttar Pradesh) and Nepal, plus a pair in Lal Suhanra National Park in Pakistan reintroduced there from Nepal. They are confined to the tall grasslands and forests in the foothills of the Himalayas. Two-thirds of the world&#x27;s Indian rhinoceroses are now confined to the Kaziranga National Park situated in the Golaghat district of Assam, India.

=== Javan ===

The Javan rhinoceros (&quot;Rhinoceros sondaicus&quot;) is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world. According to 2015 estimates, only about 60 remain, in Java, Indonesia, all in the wild. It is also the least known rhino species. Like the closely related, and larger, Indian rhinoceros, the Javan rhino has a single horn. Its hairless, hazy gray skin falls into folds into the shoulder, back, and rump, giving it an armored appearance. Its length reaches including the head, and its height . Adults are variously reported to weigh or . Male horns can reach in length, while in females they are knobs or altogether absent. These animals prefer dense lowland rain forest, tall grass and reed beds that are plentiful with large floodplains and mud wallows.

Though once widespread throughout Asia, by the 1930s, they were nearly hunted to extinction in Nepal, India, Burma, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra for the supposed medical powers of their horns and blood. As of 2015, only 58–61 individuals remain in Ujung Kulon National Park, Java, Indonesia. The last known Javan rhino in Vietnam was reportedly killed for its horn in 2011 by Vietnamese poachers. Now only Java contains the last Javan rhinos.

=== Sumatran ===

The Sumatran rhinoceros (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis&quot;) is the smallest extant rhinoceros species, as well as the one with the most hair. It can be found at very high altitudes in Borneo and Sumatra. Because of habitat loss and poaching, their numbers have declined, and it has become the second most threatened rhinoceros. About 275 Sumatran rhinos are believed to remain. There are three subspecies of Sumatran rhinoceros: the Sumatran rhinoceros proper (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis&quot;), the Bornean rhinoceros (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni&quot;) and the possibly extinct Northern Sumatran rhinoceros (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis&quot;).

A mature rhino typically stands about high at the shoulder, has a length of and weighs around , though the largest individuals have been known to weigh as much as . Like the African species, it has two horns; the larger is the front (), with the smaller usually less than long. Males have much larger horns than the females. Hair can range from dense (the densest hair in young calves) to sparse. The color of these rhinos is reddish brown. The body is short and has stubby legs. The lip is prehensile.

Sumatran rhinoceros once were spread across South-east Asia, but now are on the verge of extinction, confined to several parts of Indonesia and Malaysia by reproductive isolation. There were 320 &quot;D. sumatrensis&quot; in 1995, which, by 2011, had dwindled to 216. It has been found through DNA comparison that the Sumatran rhinoceros is the most ancient extant rhinoceros and related to the extinct Eurasian woolly rhino species, &quot;Coelodonta&quot;. In 1994, Alan Rabinowitz publicly denounced governments, non-governmental organizations, and other institutions for lacking in their attempts to conserve the Sumatran rhinoceros. To conserve it, they would have to relocate them from small forests to breeding programs that could monitor their breeding success. To boost reproduction, the Malaysian and Indonesian governments could also agree to exchange the gametes of the Sumatran and (smaller) Bornean subspecies. The Indonesian and Malaysian governments have also proposed a single management unit for these two ancient subspecies.

Plantations for palm oil have taken out the living areas and led to the eradication of the rhino in Sumatra.

== Evolution ==

Rhinocerotoidea diverged from other perissodactyls (odd-toed ungulates) by the early Eocene around 51-58 million years ago, with the earliest representatives appearing during the early-middle Eocene in Asia, around 54 million years ago. The family of modern rhinoceroses, Rhinocerotidae appeared during the middle-late Eocene around 39-40 million years ago, roughly at the same in North America and Asia, with rhinoceroses migrating into Europe at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary ~34 million years ago as part of the &quot;Grande Coupure&quot; along with many other Asian migrants. Rhinocerotids represented the only living family of rhinocerotoids following the end of the Oligocene epoch around 23 million and the extinction of other rhinocertoid groups such as the giant paraceratheres. During the early Miocene epoch, around 20 million years ago rhinocerotids migrated into Africa following its connection to Eurasia. The last common ancestor of living rhinoceroses (which belong to the subgroup Rhinocerotina) is thought to have lived during the Miocene, at least 15-16 million years ago. Rhinocerotids reached maximum diversity in Europe and Asia during the Miocene epoch, with the group declining in diversity during the late Miocene following unfavourable climatic change, becoming entirely extinct in North America at the beginning of the Pliocene, around 5 million years ago.

The earliest remains of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (which includes the living Indian/one horned and Javan rhinoceros) are known from the Late Miocene, represented by remains such as an indeterminate species found in deposits in Myanmar dating to around 8-9 million years ago, with the two modern species appearing during the Early-Middle Pleistocene epoch. The earliest unambiguous relatives of white and black rhinoceros belonging to the genera &quot;Ceratotherium&quot; and &quot;Diceros&quot;, first appear during the late Miocene, with the first unambiguous appearance of modern white and black rhinoceros during the Early Pleistocene. The earliest unambiguous remains of &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; are known from the latest Pliocene, with the appearance of the modern Sumatran rhinoceros during the Early Pleistocene.
Alongside the extant species, four additional species of rhinoceros survived into the Last Glacial Period: the woolly rhinoceros (&quot;Coelodonta antiquitatis&quot;), &quot;Elasmotherium sibiricum&quot; and two species of &quot;Stephanorhinus,&quot; Merck&#x27;s rhinoceros (&quot;Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis&quot;) and the Narrow-nosed rhinoceros (&quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus)&quot;.

== Predators, poaching and hunting ==


Adult rhinoceroses have no real predators in the wild, other than humans. Young rhinos sometimes fall prey to big cats, crocodiles, African wild dogs, and hyenas.

Although rhinos are large and aggressive and have a reputation for being resilient, they are very easily poached; they visit water holes daily and can be easily killed while they drink. As of December 2009, poaching increased globally while efforts to protect the rhino are considered increasingly ineffective. The most serious estimate, that only 3% of poachers are successfully countered, is reported of Zimbabwe, while Nepal has largely avoided the crisis. Poachers have become more sophisticated. South African officials have called for urgent action against poaching after poachers killed the last female rhino in the Krugersdorp Game Reserve near Johannesburg. Statistics from South African National Parks show that 333 rhinoceroses were killed in South Africa in 2010, increasing to 668 by 2012, over 1,004 in 2013, and over 1,338 killed in 2015. In some cases rhinos are tranquilized and their horns removed leaving them to bleed to death, while in other instances more than the horn is taken.

The Namibian government has supported the practice of rhino trophy hunting as a way to raise money for conservation. Hunting licenses for five Namibian black rhinos are auctioned annually, with the money going to the government&#x27;s Game Products Trust Fund. Some conservationists and members of the public oppose or question this practice.

== Horn use ==
Rhinoceros horns develop from subcutaneous tissues, and are made of keratinous mineralized compartments. The horns root in a germinative layer.

Rhinoceros horns are used in traditional medicines in parts of Asia, and for dagger handles in Yemen and Oman. Esmond Bradley Martin has reported on the trade for dagger handles in Yemen, which was historically a major source for the demand for rhino horn in the late 20th century. In Europe, it was historically believed that rhino horns could purify water and could detect poisoned liquids, and likely believed to be an aphrodisiac and an antidote to poison.

It is a common misconception that rhinoceros horn in powdered form is used as an aphrodisiac or a cure for cancer in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as &quot;Cornu Rhinoceri Asiatici&quot; (犀角, &quot;xījiǎo&quot;, &quot;rhinoceros horn&quot;); no TCM text in history has ever mentioned such prescriptions. In TCM, rhino horn is sometimes prescribed for fevers and convulsions, a treatment not supported by evidence-based medicine: this treatment has been compared to consuming fingernail clippings in water. In a 2021 survey of Chinese users of rhinoceros horn TCM products, the vast majority of respondents cited &quot;dispelling heat&quot; and &quot;detoxification&quot; as reasons for using rhino horn. In 1993, China signed the CITES treaty and removed rhinoceros horn from the Chinese medicine pharmacopeia, administered by the Ministry of Health. In 2011, the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the United Kingdom issued a formal statement condemning the use of rhinoceros horn. A growing number of TCM educators are also speaking out against the practice, although some TCM practitioners still believe that it is a life-saving medicine.

Vietnam reportedly has the biggest number of rhino horn consumers, with their demand driving most of the poaching, which has risen to record levels. The &quot;Vietnam CITES Management Authority&quot; has claimed that Hanoi recently experienced a 77% drop in the usage of rhino horn, but National Geographic has challenged these claims, noticing that there was no rise in the numbers of criminals who were apprehended or prosecuted. South African rhino poaching&#x27;s main destination market is Vietnam. An average sized horn can bring in as much as a quarter of a million dollars in Vietnam and many rhino range states have stockpiles of rhino horn.

== Horn trade ==
International trade in rhinoceros horn has been declared illegal by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1977. A proposal by Swaziland to lift the international ban was rejected in October 2016. Domestic sale of rhinoceros horn in South Africa, home of 80% of the remaining rhino population, was banned as of 2009. The ban was overturned in a court case in 2017, and South Africa plans to draft regulations for the sale of rhino horn, possibly including export for &quot;non-commercial purposes&quot;. The South African government has proposed that a legal trade of rhino horn be established, arguing that this could reduce poaching and prevent the extinction of this species.

In March 2013, some researchers suggested that the only way to reduce poaching would be to establish a regulated trade based on humane and renewable harvesting from live rhinos. The World Wildlife Fund opposes legalization of the horn trade, as it may increase demand, while IFAW released a report by &quot;EcoLarge&quot;, suggesting that more thorough knowledge of economic factors is required to justify the pro-trade option.

== Conservation ==
According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, conservation of African rhinoceroses as consumers of large amounts of vegetation is crucial to maintaining the shape of the African landscape and the natural resources of local communities.

=== Ways to prevent poaching ===

==== Horn removal ====
To prevent poaching, in certain areas, rhinos have been tranquillized and their horns removed. Armed park rangers, particularly in South Africa, are also working on the front lines to combat poaching, sometimes killing poachers who are caught in the act. A 2012 spike in rhino killings increased concerns about the future of the species.

==== Horn poisoning ====
In 2011, the Rhino Rescue Project began a horn-trade control method consisting of infusing the horns of living rhinos with a mixture of a pink dye and an acaricide (to kill ticks) which is safe for rhinos but toxic to humans. The procedure also includes inserting three RFID identification chips and taking DNA samples. Because of the fibrous nature of rhino horn, the pressurized dye infuses the interior of the horn but does not color the surface or affect rhino behavior. Depending on the quantity of horn a person consumes, experts believe the acaricide would cause nausea, stomach-ache, and diarrhea, and possibly convulsions. It would not be fatal—the primary deterrent is the knowledge that the treatment has been applied, communicated by signs posted at the refuges. The original idea grew out of research into the horn as a reservoir for one-time tick treatments, and experts selected an acaricide they think is safe for the rhino, oxpeckers, vultures, and other animals in the preserve&#x27;s ecosystem. Proponents claim that the dye cannot be removed from the horns, and remains visible on X-ray scanners even when the horn is ground to a fine powder.

The UK charity organization Save the Rhino has criticized horn poisoning on moral and practical grounds. The organization questions the assumptions that the infusion technique works as intended, and that even if the poison were effective, whether middlemen in a lucrative, illegal trade would care much about the effect it would have on buyers. Additionally, rhino horn is increasingly purchased for decorative use, rather than for use in traditional medicine. Save the Rhino questions the feasibility of applying the technique to all African rhinos, since workers would have to reapply the acaricide every four years. It was also reported that one out of 150 rhinos treated did not survive the anesthesia.

==== Artificial substitute for rhinoceros horn ====
Another way to undercut the rhinoceros horn market has been suggested by Matthew Markus of Pembient, a biotechnology firm. He proposes the synthesis of an artificial substitute for rhinoceros horn. To enable authorities to distinguish the bioengineered horn from real rhinoceros horn, the genetic code of the bioengineered horn could be registered, similar to the DNA of living rhinoceros in the RhODIS (Rhino DNA Index System). Initial responses from many conservationists were negative, but a 2016 report from TRAFFIC—which monitors trade in wildlife and animal parts—conceded that it &quot;...would be rash to rule out the possibility that trade in synthetic rhinoceros horn could play a role in future conservation strategies&quot;.

== Historical representations ==
Woolly rhinoceroses are depicted the European Paleolithic art, such as in cave paintings in Chauvet Cave in France, which date to around 30-40,000 years ago.
Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides (2nd century BC) mentions the rhinoceros in his book &quot;On the Erythraean Sea&quot;.

In Khmer art, the Hindu god Agni is depicted with a rhinoceros as his vahana. Similarly in medieval era Thai literature, Agni also called &quot;Phra Phloeng&quot; is sometimes described as riding a rhinoceros.

Albrecht Dürer created a famous woodcut of a rhinoceros in 1515, based on a written description and brief sketch by Valentim Fernandes, a German printer resident in Lisbon. He never saw the animal itself, so &quot;Dürer&#x27;s Rhinoceros&quot; is a somewhat inaccurate depiction.

There are legends about rhinoceroses stamping out fire in Burma, India, and Malaysia. The mythical rhinoceros has a special name in Malay, , wherein means rhinoceros, and means fire. The animal would come when a fire was lit in the forest and stamp it out. There are no recent confirmations of this phenomenon. This legend was depicted in the film &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; (1980), which shows an African rhinoceros putting out two campfires.

In 1974, a lavender rhinoceros symbol began to be used as a symbol of the gay community in Boston, United States.
